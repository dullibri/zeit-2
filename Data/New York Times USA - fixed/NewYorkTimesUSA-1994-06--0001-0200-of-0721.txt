HEADLINE: Future of Faith Worries Catholic Leaders

SERIES: Searching Its Soul: The American Catholic Church -- Last of four articles.

BYLINE: By PETER STEINFELS 

 BODY:
It was an awesome scene: nearly 400,000 Catholic teen-agers encamped last August in a Rocky Mountain park to join in sung praise and solemn prayer with Pope John Paul II. Amid this army of young believers, it was hard to imagine that the Roman Catholic Church in the United States, 60 million strong and growing, is fraught with anxiety about its future.
No one imagines that American Catholicism's vast numbers and impressive network of parishes, schools, hospitals, universities and social services will soon disappear. But church leaders increasingly wonder whether the church, even as its ranks increase and it draws new energy from the latest waves of immigrants, is losing its distinctive identity. 
 Enormous public attention has been focused in recent years on disputes over the church's teachings on abortion, divorce and sexual morality, on the arrests of priests for sexually abusing children and on the restriction of the priesthood to males, which the Pope affirmed on Monday in a declaration that among faithful Catholics the matter was no longer open for debate.
Yet the strong feelings stirred by these issues may be hampering the church's response to a less visible but more pervasive problem, what worried leaders inside the church have begun calling a "hollowing out" or "thinning" of Catholicism.
"We are a church at risk," said Marcel J. Dumestre, director of the Institute for Ministry at Loyola University in New Orleans.
There could scarcely be a more dramatic example of what worries such leaders than a finding of a New York Times/CBS News Poll in April: almost two-thirds of American Catholics believe that during Mass, the central sacred ritual of Catholicism, the bread and wine can best be understood as "symbolic reminders of Christ" rather than as actually being changed into Christ's body and blood. Even among the subgroup of Catholics who said they attended Mass every week or almost every week, 51 percent described the rite as strictly symbolic.
For centuries, and especially since the Reformation, the church has insisted upon the actual change of the bread and wine into the "real presence" of Christ as a defining mark of the Mass. This emphasis on "sacramentality," on God's life-giving action through material signs and physical acts -- water, wine, bread, laying on of hands, all mediated by a structured church -- has been the hallmark of the Catholic approach to worship.
No survey question can adequately measure a complex religious belief, but results so much at odds with longstanding doctrine are "certainly an alarm bell," said Archbishop Rembert Weakland of Milwaukee.
 
Parallel With Some Protestants
 Paradoxically, some recent sources of the church's vitality -- especially its encouragement of an active laity and its heightened sensitivity to social problems -- may have contributed to this spiritual drift. A number of Catholic thinkers who endorse those trends worry nonetheless that the Church's mystical element is being lost, eclipsed by a concern with ethical conduct, psychological healing and social service.
At the same time, sociologists of American religion point out that religious groups demanding adherence to clear-cut beliefs and practices have tended to flourish while those refusing to define their boundaries have languished.
Catholicism, in their eyes, is confronting the same quandaries as the mainline Protestant denominations, for whom tolerance and humanitarian social action have become more important than doctrinal boundaries. Their numbers have been declining while those of evangelical and fundamentalist groups have grown.
Yet rigid adherence to traditional doctrine also has a cost: the alienation of Catholics who believe that teachings in areas like divorce and contraception are incompatible with the complexities of their own experience.
 
Membership
Commitment? Yes. But on What?
 "Abortion, absolution, afterlife, AIDS, alcohol abuse, arms control, art, asbestos, astrology, atheism, Auschwitz. . . ." R. Scott Appleby, director of the Cushwa Center for the Study of American Catholicism at the University of Notre Dame, was reading aloud an index of topics that Catholic leaders and organizations had recently addressed. He noted the mix of the spiritual and the social, the pastoral and the political.
"An impressive range of concerns," Professor Appleby summed up in an interview, "that reach into almost every aspect of American culture and public life."
But he also drew attention to "the cracks in the fresco": the decline in Mass attendance, the ebb in financial support from the laity, the disaffection of many women, the shrinking number of priests and especially "the increasing difficulty of socializing young people into a committed Catholicism."
Professor Appleby sees a coming generation of Catholics who periodically turn to the church for psychological support but "with no sense of ownership." A traditional sense of being Catholic, he said, is being "displaced by a more eclectic kind of piety" that is unlikely to fill the pews, the collection baskets and the ranks of priests.
This concern about the loss of Catholic identity, once largely limited to conservatives or Catholics nostalgic for the church of their youth, is now expressed as well by liberals like Archbishop Weakland.
"It is becoming clearer and clearer that committed Catholics are very committed, very involved," the Archbishop said in a recent interview. "And then there are the others. They go to Mass irregularly and they say they are Catholics on a census, but that is about it."
 
New Steps, Old Problems
 Although liberals like Archbishop Weakland and conservative church leaders closer to the Vatican's outlook increasingly recognize the same problem, their contrasting outlooks prevent a concerted response.
Many bishops, for example, hope that confusion or ignorance about Catholic beliefs will be countered by the new catechism. But its appearance in English last Friday was first delayed for more than a year by the Vatican's rejection of a gender-neutral translation and then clouded by criticism of the approved translation's repeated use of "man" and "he" for all humankind.
Similarly, the Pope's declaration on Monday that ruled out even consideration of women's ordination was welcomed by conservatives as a needed clarification of Catholic identity but worried liberals. They fear that the declaration will feed disaffection in a Catholic population that, according to surveys, has long favored ordaining women by a large majority.
"How, as a bishop, am I to deal with the anger and disillusionment which will inevitably result?" Archbishop Weakland asked on Monday in a written response to the Vatican declaration.
 
Institutions
Where to Go Now After Opening Up
 Anxiety is heightened by awareness that the church is undergoing a double transition. From parishes to Catholic universities, lay people are increasingly filling major posts traditionally held by priests and sisters. The next two decades are likely to see a decisive shift in leadership throughout Catholic life from a generation brought up in the certainties of the pre-Second Vatican Council church to one formed during the uncertainties and experimentation of the late 60's and 70's.
Thirty years ago, the only lay people on almost all parish payrolls were janitors, housekeepers and perhaps the organist. Properly religious tasks were the responsibility of priests, except in parochial schools where sisters held sway.
Today, quite apart from the 149,000 lay people who outnumber nuns 10 to 1 as teachers in parish schools, parishes employ 20,000 lay people and sisters to direct religious education, prepare people for baptism and other sacraments, plan liturgies and carry out other pastoral tasks. A few hundred individuals are actually running parishes that no longer have a priest of their own.
Forty percent of these 20,000 parish ministers are sisters, but almost half of these women are over 60 years old. The lay workers who will soon be filling these slots have significantly fewer years of Catholic schooling and of training in specifically religious subjects. And with women constituting 85 percent of the new parish ministers, questions raised by feminists, whether of equal treatment, access to the priesthood or religious language, seem certain to become more pressing.
As long as priests carried out almost all pastoral tasks, bishops, who oversaw seminary training and parish assignments, effectively held the reins. Today parish pastors are choosing the lay ministers, often from among parish volunteers whose training, in turn, may be on-the-job or obtained from graduate programs in theology and pastoral work. For many parishioners this may be invigorating, but it also means a weakening of the church hierarchy's traditional control over practice and belief.
 
Catholic Hospitals
 The problem of maintaining a special identity stretches from the religious knowledge of individual church members to the whole array of Catholic institutions.
The Catholic hospitals, universities and social services dotting most large and medium-sized American cities were established primarily to serve the needs of Catholic immigrant populations. They were supported by money raised by the church and were staffed by people, largely priests and nuns, animated by a shared religious commitment.
But today, in a spirit of community outreach, many of those institutions are as likely to serve non-Catholics as Catholics. They increasingly rely on government money or support from non-Catholic foundations and donors. And they are more and more staffed and led by professionals chosen on the basis of technical skills not religious beliefs.
As a consequence, Catholic leaders are wondering what is apt to make the Catholic hospital of the future different from its public counterpart. Will it, for example, be legally able to bar procedures like abortion that violate Catholic moral principles?
And what will make the Catholic university different from the state or private institution down the road?
 
Eyes on Universities
 In fact, Catholic higher education presents a laboratory case of the conflicts surrounding Catholic identity. Besides wielding considerable influence over the lives of young Catholics attending them, the nation's 235 Catholic colleges and universities are major seedbeds for Catholic thought and places where scholars in fields from literature to economics can plumb the relevance of the church tradition to contemporary culture.
For over two decades, most of these institutions have purposely tried to escape from a religious conformity that Catholic educators believed was stifling intellectual excellence. Faculty members were hired on the basis of academic standards that usually excluded religious considerations. Control was often passed from religious orders to independent lay-run boards. Urban Catholic universities like Georgetown in Washington and Fordham in New York attracted highly diverse student bodies as well as faculties.
In 1990, after years of consultations, the Pope issued "Ex Corde Ecclesiae," a document calling for a renewed emphasis on the religious identity of Catholic higher education. But the effort by a committee of the American bishops' conference to draft "ordinances" applying the document has led to a standoff with Catholic educators, many of whom acknowledge the need to insure their institutions' Catholic identity but also fear that the bishops' involvement may threaten academic freedom and their campuses' eligibility for Government money.
Efforts to bring hiring of theology faculty members or other campus policies under the control of bishops will only stir a backlash, these educators warn, and actually increase the pressure toward secularization.
 
Factions
Several Agendas To Save Church
 The pattern of conflict over Catholic higher education is paralleled in other areas of church life -- from sexual ethics to the priesthood. At least three schools of thought are competing to shape the church's future.
In one camp are conservatives looking to Rome for unambiguous directives concerning church teaching and policy and to Pope John Paul II as a champion of Catholic forcefulness. They want papally approved teaching energetically proclaimed and, wherever possible, directly enforced by bishops and priests.
Against a culture that these conservatives consider profoundly hostile to Catholicism, they seek bulwarks in official texts: for example, the Pope's latest declaration rejecting women's ordination, the new catechism, the 1968 papal encyclical, "Humanae Vitae," affirming the condemnation of contraception, Vatican statements upholding traditional sexual morality or chastising dissenting theologians.
They echo the cry that Catholicism must be "counter-cultural," a term that Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger, the Vatican's overseer of Catholic doctrine, borrowed from 1960's student leftists to signal a sweeping challenge to the materialism, individualism and secularism that they associate with the dominant cultural elites in the West.
The conservatives are also convinced that by imitating the Pope's confidence in the truth of church teaching and his appeal to heroic self-sacrifice the church could recruit candidates for the priesthood and communicate its faith to young people.
The Vatican itself prefers to concentrate on the zones of church life where it can more easily exercise control: the appointment of bishops, the training of seminarians, the teaching of theology in Vatican-accredited degree programs like the one at Catholic University of America, the policies of religious orders of priests and nuns.
Safeguarding a highly loyal core of bishops, clergy and theologians in the United States and elsewhere appears to be the Vatican's priority, even if the immediate cost is fewer priests or isolation from contemporary culture. The church's leaders in Rome want to insure that at least that nucleus will be there when the world comes to its senses.
On the other end of the spectrum are groups of liberal Catholics who worry less about the maintenance of traditional Catholic identity than about goals like opening the priesthood to women, readmitting to active service those priests who have married, revoking the church's condemnation of homosexual relations or supporting radical social and political movements.
As in the Democratic Party, the church's left often resembles a collection of groups seeking recognition for single interests or excluded minorities. It includes the Women's Ordination Conference; Corpus, an association of priests who resigned to marry; Dignity, a group representing Catholic homosexuals, and Pax Christi, an anti-military organization. But the sympathy for one another's causes is general.
For some in this camp, the emergence of a "cafeteria Catholicism" in which individual believers choose whatever doctrines and practices accord with their own experiences or needs and feel little loyalty to church institutions is an almost inevitable reflection of American culture -- and one that does not disturb them.
 
Struggling in the Middle
 Caught between these factions, striving to construct a center that will hold, is a segment of American church leadership that doubts whether the liberal agenda offers a realistic remedy to the pressing question of Catholic identity but also demurs from the conservative tendency to rely heavily on authoritative statements or papal example.
Instead, these leaders argue that Catholic identity must be nurtured among a broad base of Catholics by persuasion, a task that they believe demands flexibly adapting general directives to particular circumstances, encouraging consultation with clergy and laity and living with a wide variety of theological opinion.
The liberals among them generally favor revision of church teachings in areas like birth control, divorce and the ordination of married men or women. The moderate conservatives among them disagree but do not treat the liberals' stance as disloyalty to the church or Pope.
Like any centrist group, this one is subject to withering attacks from both left and right. Many militant liberals suspect that talk about Catholic identity threatens a return to what they view as a narrower Catholicism. For them, assuring the church's well-being demands further relaxing, not reinforcing, the boundaries of Catholic life.
Militant conservatives, on the other hand, believe that the moderates' emphasis on consultation and persuasion means trimming church authority and doctrine to appease feminists, advocates of sexual liberation and the new layers of church employees whom the conservatives consider especially susceptible to intellectual fashions.
The next 10 to 15 years may well determine whether the American Catholic Church survives as a flabby and failing institution, a reduced but militant body or a still-growing and thriving church.
"There has to be a clear articulation of boundaries," said Professor Appleby of Notre Dame. But this must be done, he said, without cutting off Catholicism from "what is good and enduring in contemporary culture."

"I attend Mass weekly, not daily anymore, but I feel like I'm a very active Catholic. I believe that the bread and wine is changed in the Mass. I believe that I have received the body and blood of Christ, just like at the Last Supper. There are some things in this world I think you just have to believe.
I feel the church has a problem with the priesthood. Why can't we allow priests to get married? It would solve a lot of problems. We don't get a very intellectual minis try anymore."
Arlene Pagano, 60
Rolla, Mo.
 
"I'm only half a Catholic now, I haven't been to Mass in six months. I stopped mainly because of the priest we had. The needs of the people weren't his main con cern, and I think the whole church is becoming that way. I think Je sus Christ is out of the church. We virtually don't have a sermon anymore.
I don't want women to be priests; the Bible says not to. Ifyou don't have that as your foun dation, you're lost."
Mark Albertson, 29
Lakeview, Ore.
 
"My faith somehow was going down the drain, what with the whole immigration process and the civil war in El Salvador. I felt I needed to talk to somebody. There was a hunger for religion, for God and Christ. But it took awhile for that to come back. I started going to the different groups and retreats and my faith just kept growing stronger.
Ninety-five percent of my life is directed by my faith. It definitely affected my decision to go into so cial work. That seemed like the best way of giving something to the community."
Julio Ramos, 31
Los Angeles,
immigrated at age 16
 
"I'm a passive Catholic. I'm dis illusioned with the Catholic religion. I do kind of believe in the story of Jesus, but it's the rules they make -- you have to go to church every Sunday, it's a sin this and a sin that.
Maybe I'm too liberal and too modern. It just doesn't seem right for a priest not to marry, and it just doesn't seem right that they had so many child-molesting cases. I have three sons, and I wouldn't trust any of them to be alone with a priest."
Linda Tassin, 37

HEADLINE: The Pyongyang Puzzle

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TOKYO, May 31

 BODY:
When North Korea first began playing cat-and-mouse with the Clinton Administration over nuclear inspections, Washington's goal seemed simple: the Communist leaders of one of the world's most unpredictable states could not be permitted to possess a nuclear weapon.
But in the ensuing 18 months, as Washington and its allies have alternately tried to pressure, sweet-talk and threaten the North into giving up its bomb project, reality has set in and the objectives have grown far more complicated. 
 And during the last few days, as the North has raced to pull nuclear fuel out of a reactor in open defiance of a treaty banning the spread of nuclear weapons, there are still raging arguments among the allies over what to insist upon, how much risk of confrontation to take and what to settle for.
The problem is that Mr. Clinton's initial goal -- to establish with certainty that the North does not possess a bomb -- is now virtually unattainable. If the North has built one or two bombs, an "if" that stymies intelligence agencies, the chances of finding it soon are next to nil.
So during the last year, the Administration and its allies have subtly shifted their goals. More important than finding one or two weapons made in the past, American officials began saying late last year, is preventing the North from acquiring more. As an inducement, they offered talks on diplomatic and economic relations.
While it would be a bad precedent to pay countries off to observe the terms of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, the Japanese suggest, it would be worse to let North Korea become the first country to abandon the treaty.
And while a nuclear-armed North may be a scary prospect, many in South Korea ask, is it worth risking a second disastrous confrontation on the Korean peninsula in 40 years, especially when the prosperous South has clearly won the economic contest and has so much to lose?
The result has been a muddying of objectives that helps to explain how allied officials can exclaim one week that a solution is in sight, then despair the next week about looming disaster.
"No one is sure exactly what we want, and what we will settle for," a senior Japanese diplomat said the other day. "So no one is quite sure how hard to push."
The North has sensed the confusion, and seems to have capitalized on it skillfully.
Several times now North Korea has changed the terms of the argument. For seven years it barred inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency, despite the fact that it had signed the nonproliferation treaty in 1985. When it finally allowed them in, North Korea entered an argument over whether they had the right to visit two waste dumps detected by United States satellites that might reveal how much plutonium the North possesses.
When that issue seemed likely to bring Security Council action, the Government announced it was withdrawing from the nuclear treaty. This sent Washington scrambling to come up with incentives to keep the North from pulling out, a step that would legally bar all inspectors.
That issue was never resolved. But for more than half a year inspectors were barred from the heavily guarded nuclear complex at Yongbyon anyway, and their monitoring cameras ran out of film and batteries. When they were finally allowed back, in March, they were prevented from taking samples to determine what had happened in the interim.
 
Worry About New Fuel Supply
 A few weeks ago, facing a new threat of economic sanctions, the North switched tactics again. It let the inspectors finish their sampling work in one building while it began unloading fuel from the biggest reactor, a step that would give North Korea the raw material for four or five more bombs and would destroy the best evidence of how much plutonium was diverted in the past.
Suddenly, rather than focus on history, the United States raced to make sure no new fuel is diverted.
The current crisis is focused on the unloading of that fuel, which apparently proceeded at a startling pace over the weekend. Hans Blix, the director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, warned last week that within days the agency "would not be in a position to verify, with any degree of confidence, that all nuclear material" is accounted for, meaning that there was little left to negotiate.
 
The Pace Quickens
 Those accusing the Administration of taking too soft a line say it has simply been strung along: the North is moving flat-out to build a bomb, several officials who served on President George Bush's national security team argue, and is simply playing for time. The "Great Leader" of the North, Kim Il Sung, they say, is as wily now as he was 40 years ago when he took Washington unawares and launched the Korean War.
Evidence to support that view has greatly strengthened recently.
Inspectors say the capacity of the reprocessing plant that produces bomb-grade plutonium has been doubled; United States intelligence officials expect a second test imminently of a North Korea-designed missile that can carry a nuclear weapon.
"For every step we take to slow things down," Leonard Spector of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace said recently, "they take two to speed it up."
But defenders of the keep-talking strategy say what the North wants more than a bomb is to maintain the mystery of whether it can build one. Unless its adversaries are kept in the dark about the program, this theory goes, there is no chance the North will get the economic aid it needs so desperately.
"It comes down to this," said an American military official in Seoul: "If we know that the bomb project is a dud, we'll forget about the North and move on to the next crisis. They get nothing. And if we know it is a success, we go to sanctions. So they want to keep it in-between."
A result of such mind games is that the once-definitive statements from Washington and Seoul about what the world can tolerate now come in many more shades of gray.
"Clearly, the North Koreans want to preserve as much ambiguity about their program as they can," said Han Sung Joo, the patient and soft-spoken South Korean Foreign Minister. "But rather than view this as a question of whether the nuclear program will be open or not, I think we have come to see that the question is how much transparency the North will provide." Somewhere along that scale, he said, "we have to draw a line."
 
'Very Dangerous Point'
 The effort this week is to convince the North that in unloading the fuel and preventing the inspectors from sampling it, they are at the edge of no return. The South Korean President, Kim Young Sam, called President Clinton today, and Mr. Kim's spokesman immediately announced that the two leaders saw the issue reaching a "very dangerous point."
The Security Council, in subdued language aimed at appeasing China, which has consistently opposed sanctions, tried to send the same message in a statement Sunday that "further Security Council consideration will take place" to achieve full compliance by North Korea, a veiled reference to sanctions.
But the North knows that no one wants to go that route -- not China, and certainly not Japan, where the Government is doing everything it can to suppress discussion of the extensive contingency plans it has drawn up to cut off hundreds of millions of dollars in funds to the North, and perhaps take part in a blockade.
North Korea may well turn to the technique that has worked so many times before: offer a little more transparency, just enough to defuse the immediate crisis, and keep building at Yongbyon.

HEADLINE: Effort Is Begun By Dominicans To Seal Border

BYLINE: By JOHN KIFNER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: DAJABON, Dominican Republic, May 30

 BODY:
The Deputy Secretary of the Armed Forces stomped along a dirt path by the muddy Massacre River, glaring at hundreds of Haitians on the other side sitting under trees or wading out to probe for a place to cross.
Every few dozen yards on the Dominican side of the river was a freshly arrived paratrooper in the black beret of the elite Airborne Brigade, blocking the countless trails worn toward places selling gasoline or other scarce goods. 
 The paratroopers pulled themselves to attention at the approach of the officer, Maj. Gen. Luis Luna Paulino.
"I don't want to see anyone talking to Haitians," the general barked to a pickup truck loaded with new troops. "Anyone talking to Haitians will be out of a job."
For four days now, since shortly after President Joaquin Balaguer met with President Clinton's point man on Haiti, William H. Gray 3d, the general and his men appear to have shut down this once-bustling smuggling center.
It was a remarkable turnabout.
For months, Mr. Balaguer was loath to crack down on the booming smuggling trade, his public reason a fear that increased hardship in Haiti would bring an unwelcome flood of refugees.
With the embargo stepped up a week ago to include everything but food and medical supplies, the porous Dominican border was the weakest point in the international effort to unseat the Haitian military junta that ousted the elected President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, in 1991.
But after the hotly disputed Dominican presidential election on May 16, which was marked by widespread accusations of fraud by international observers as well as Dominicans, Mr. Balaguer found himself susceptible to American persuasion.
 
Understanding With the U.S.
 The meeting with Mr. Gray was widely seen here as producing an understanding that the Americans would not make an issue of the election and the Dominicans would cooperate in enforcing the embargo. Mr. Balaguer dispatched General Luna Paulino, the second-ranking official in the armed forces, to the northern sector of the border and another major general, Tomas Fernandez Alarcon, to the southern area.
The Defense Ministry says that half of the army, some 15,000 troops, is on the border, and that the regular border guards, many of whom had been augmenting their meager salaries on the brisk gasoline trade, were transferred out or in some cases arrested.
"Before, the United Nations only called the embargo 'provisional,' " General Luna Paulino explained to a visitor, saying he had been sent here at the end of last week with a new set of orders. "Now our primary target is to stop all the fuel to Haiti. We cannot expose the Dominican Republic to losing international credibility."
But at night, hundreds of Haitians still try to swarm across the river, some now carrying sticks or knives. Groups of the Haitians fight with the soldiers, the general said, while others scatter in different directions trying to fill plastic containers of fuel. Townspeople say a rich Haitian businessman waits on the other side to collect the fuel.
Sealing off a town and the official border crossing here is the easiest part, military officials concede. Most of the frontier is unsettled hill and river country, difficult to patrol, the general said, and his troops are short of vehicles, communications equipment, night vision scopes and even rations. There have been nocturnal encounters with smugglers in the hills, too, including one in which, General Luna Paulino said, he was hit in the arm with a rock.
Given the difficulties -- and the profits to be made -- it is uncertain how effective the effort will be or, indeed, how long it will be pressed.
"It's like a shell game," said a Western diplomat unimpressed with the flurry of activity. "They'll keep it up for a few weeks. There is still stuff getting through at night."
But the army has already collected hundreds of fuel barrels, plastic jugs and ingenious tanks, including hollowed-out automobile, bus and truck seats and a dump truck equipped to hold only a few inches of sand with gasoline concealed below. Some of the houses he has raided in town, the general said, had false walls to hide gasoline tanks.
 
A Blow to Residents
 In the sun-baked market square of Dajabon, residents mourned the economic disaster that had befallen them. In addition to the profit to be made from gasoline smuggling, Haitians were allowed freely over the border twice a week to stock up on supplies, mostly bananas, chickens and eggs. At midday, merchants who came in from the countryside after buying from farmers were glumly reloading their sagging pickup trucks with unsold produce.
"A few days ago you could come into this town until 1 o'clock in the morning and find Haitians smuggling," grumbled Bonifacio Vargas, standing with other Dominicans by huge heaps of unsold bananas. "Now you see nothing."
Maria Tejada agreed. "Now it's completely sealed," she said. "The army has closed everything." Pura Sanchez added angrily: "I have five kids I support selling bananas. No Haitian can come across, and I don't make a single peso. What am I to do?"
Running his hand across his neck like a knife, Ramon Grollon said: "The U.N. is cutting my throat. We have lost all our money. The Devil will take us all."
The Dominican Republic and Haiti uneasily share the Caribbean island of Hispaniola. African slaves revolting against their French masters on the western end of the island in 1804 overran the Spanish-colonized eastern portion. They remained in control until they were ousted in a war of independence in 1844.
In 1937 the Dominican Army massacred thousands of Haitians along the border.
Mr. Balaguer, though, has long enjoyed good relations with Haiti's dictators, and provided refuge in times of trouble. He is also said to detest Father Aristide, who asserted that Haitian workers who cut cane and did other menial jobs in the Dominican Republic were treated like slaves.
"Haiti's best friend is Balaguer," an important Haitian backer of the military coup, Senator Bernard Sansaricq, told the Dominican newspaper El Nacional before the President's about-face on the embargo.
 
Protege of Trujillo
 But Mr. Balaguer, a protege of the late Gen. Rafael Trujillo, who ran the country with an iron hand for 30 years, is even more aware than most Dominicans of the potential of American influence.
He was installed as President with American backing after Washington's military intervention in 1965 and has been in office for 20 of the last 28 years. One of his two losses was negotiated with the American Embassy so Mr. Balaguer's party would retain control of the Senate, which appoints all judges, thus discouraging any unseemly prosecutions.
In this year's election campaign, Mr. Balaguer sought to portray his opponent, Jose Francisco Pena Gomez, as a sort of closet Haitian -- his parents fled the 1937 massacre and he was raised by a Dominican family -- and perhaps even a furtive practitioner of voodoo, who might give the country away to its neighbors.
In the closing days, rumors swept the country that a plan was afoot, backed by France, Canada and the United States, to unite the island. Dominican flags went up on many houses as a nationalist symbol.
His narrow margin -- 30,000 votes among three million cast -- is being challenged by opponents as the product of electoral fraud, and a recount is under way.
At issue, said Juan Bolivar Diaz, a prominent journalist investigating the campaign, spreading out piles of electoral lists and returns, is a pattern in which the identification numbers of about 25 voters per precinct were switched with other names, making them ineligible, coupled with unaccountably high turnouts in some places.
The official election results show seven provinces with returns ranging from 100.36 percent of those eligible to a high of 135.22 percent in Espaillat Province.
"It's clearly visible," said Mr. Bolivar, who was the official pool reporter at the election board for the last two elections. "In our past electoral history, which is full of fraud, I don't think we have any examples where they have left such traces."
But one of Mr. Balaguer's most prominent party supporters, Donald Reid, dismissed such accusations wearily.
"I have been an actor or front-row spectator for more than 30 years, and it's always the same," said Mr. Reid, a member of the legendary Ten Families who control much of the country's wealth. "Whichever party loses, they call fraud."

Bank Buying The Building Named for It

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
The Bankers Trust Building, which takes up the block from 48th to 49th Street on Park Avenue, is no longer that in name only. In a complicated transaction, the bank is buying the part of its headquarters building that it does not already own. The deal should close by late fall.
The bank is exercising an option to buy the property according to a formula based on its fair market value as of Jan 1, 1993. The bank and the owner of the property, Sigmund Sommer Properties, could not agree on an appraisal of the building. 
 On Friday, an arbitration board set the value at $135.4 million. The bank will pay an undisclosed fraction of that amount.
The bank's appraisers, Cushman & Wakefield, had valued the property at $90 million; James Felt Appraising, the Sommer appraiser, put the worth at $180 million.
 
 
First Rights of Refusal
 The difference stemmed as much from the complicated ownership split between land and buildings as it did from different perceptions of the direction of the Manhattan office market. Although the building carries one address, 280 Park Avenue, it is in fact three separate buildings.
In 1968, shortly after the last building was built, Bankers Trust negotiated a favorable long-term lease for about 40 percent of the space. It also had first rights of refusal on space that became available when other tenants left.
Today, Bankers Trust occupies about half of the complex's more than 1.1. million square feet.
In 1979, Bankers Trust bought the land under the east and middle buildings. Eight years later it bought the 30-story building fronting on Park Avenue, from Rose Associates. Sommer retained the land under the western building, and owned both the middle and western building.
 
 
Dueling Appraisers
 Bankers Trust's lease said it signed an agreement to buy the middle and west building in 1988, although the price would not be determined for five years.
People involved in the negotiations said the owner's appraiser viewed the property as though the buildings were vacant and leasable in a real estate market that was moving out of recession, and valued it as though the buildings and land had one owner.
The bank's appraisers took into account that many of the leases, including those held by Bankers Trust, were below the rents that a prime midtown building could now command in an improving market, about $38 a square foot. Also, because Bankers Trust owned the land, the appraisers had argued that the building's value on the open market had been diminished.
 
 
Taking Over Lease in 2013
 If Bankers Trust had decided not to buy the building, it might have owned it eventually anyway. Its lease says it can take it over for the nominal sum of $20 in the year 2013.
"The formula for establishing a price, combined with saving the cost of 21 years of rental, still gave us a significant economic advantage for buying the building now," a Bankers Trust executive said.
Bankers Trust says it has not yet decided whether to take more space in the building as other tenants move or to move any people from the space it rents downtown at Bankers Trust Plaza on Liberty Street.

HEADLINE: City Asks $100 Million for Coliseum Parcel

 BODY:
A day before the start of the trial to determine whether Mortimer B. Zuckerman's $338 million contract to build at the New York Coliseum is valid, the city and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority yesterday formally agreed to offer him half the site.
In an agreement which has still to be accepted by Mr. Zuckerman, he would pay $80 million for half the property and $20 million would come from city subsidies from annual tax payments generated by the project. 
 John S. Dyson, Deputy Mayor for finance and economic development, said terms of the new offer would include a $17 million down payment by the developer and his agreement to start building by April 30, 1995.
Mr. Zuckerman, who signed a contract in 1989 to build a 2.1-million-square-foot retail, office and residential complex on the full Coliseum site at 59th Street and Columbus Circle, has been trying to negotiate a smaller development at a lower price.

U.S. to Help With Supercomputer Software

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS 

 BODY:
The Department of Energy will soon announce a federally backed effort by Cray Research Inc. and 16 other companies to develop advanced software for supercomputers, the Secretary of Energy, Hazel R. O'Leary, said yesterday.
The program, which will also involve two of the Energy Department's national laboratories, is meant to develop practical business applications for the powerful "massively parallel" supercomputers made by Cray and other American companies, including the Thinking Machines Corporation, which is also taking part. 
 About half the funds for the $50 million program will be Federal money, with Cray Research providing $12 million. The rest will come from the other companies, which have been drawn from the oil, chemical, automotive, pharmaceutical and other industries heavily reliant on powerful computers for research and product design.
Unlike many past Federal programs involving the national labs, in which weapons research sometimes found practical applications for civilian industry, the software effort is being driven by the needs and skills of private business, Mrs. O'Leary said.
"I have invited the private sector, which knows a whole series of applications" for supercomputers, Mrs. O'Leary said, describing the program with a reporter after alluding to it yesterday at a luncheon in Manhattan with security analysts.
 
Labs Seeking Mission
 The software effort comes at a time when the Government's laboratories are seeking a new mission in the post-cold-war era.
Cray is a leader in massively parallel supercomputers, so-called because they use hundreds or even thousands of inexpensive microprocessors harnessed in parallel to achieve vast information-processing power. Such machines have become tools for solving tough problems for scientists and engineers. But for corporate computing customers, a major frustration has been developing software that enables them to use the machines fully to attack practical problems like analyzing seismic data from an oilfield or simulating the inner workings of a combustion chamber in an auto engine.
"The goal is to make these machines sing," Frank Parisi, a spokesman for Cray Research, said.
Mrs. O'Leary said that some of the companies expected to be involved in the effort were Alcoa, Amoco, AT&T, Boeing, Hughes Aircraft and Schlumberger, an oil and gas exploration company. A complete list was not available yesterday because some of the companies had not yet signed final agreements to take part.
In the past, the Department of Energy has been a big customer for supercomputers primarily for the use of its own laboratories.
Two of those, the Los Alamos National Labororatory and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, will be involved in the software effort.
Larry Smarr, the director of the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois, said there was a need to develop software capable of keeping up with the increasingly powerful hardware produced by computer makers. "There are many problems of national importance that will require supercomputers that are 100 times faster than the ones today," Mr. Smarr said.
The question about the new Energy Department effort, he said, is whether it can be done in an economical way that has applications for the private sector. Too often, in the past, he said, when the Government has become involved in such efforts, there have been few useful results for private business.

HEADLINE: Clinton's Sudan Envoy to Visit African Capitals

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 31

 BODY:
President Clinton's new special envoy to the Sudan is to visit several African capitals this week as part of a stepped-up American effort to end the Sudanese civil war and to speed the flow of relief to a nation where American officials say millions are threatened with starvation.
As part of her trip, Melissa F. Wells, the special envoy appointed on May 20, plans to urge the Sudanese Government to allow an increased flow of aid to sustain the 2 million people in Sudan's rebellious south and 1.3 million in the Government-controlled north who rely on food aid. 
 American officials admit that their diplomatic efforts are unlikely to end the decades-old conflict between the Islamic Government based in the capital, Khartoum, and the Christian and animist rebels in the south. Nonetheless, these officials say it is important to press ahead with diplomatic efforts because of the magnitude of the crisis there.
"This is just about the most complicated task there is," a State Department official said. "It's more difficult than Somalia."
Malnutrition has reached emergency levels because of a serious drought and because of the Government's spring offensive, which has impeded the flow of relief and forced huge numbers of people in the southern Sudan to abandon their farms.
According to the Agency for International Development, 400,000 of the Sudan's 28 million people have become refugees in neighboring nations as a result of the 11-year-old war, while another 700,000 have been displaced internally. Some officials fear that 280,000 people will starve in the Sudan -- more than the number who died of malnutrition in Somalia.
In addition to visiting Khartoum and the rebel-held South, Ms. Wells plans to go to the four countries that are seeking to broker a peace plan in the Sudan: Ethiopia, Eritrea, Uganda and Kenya. Those four countries sponsored unsuccessful talks two weeks ago, and no new talks are scheduled until late July.
The main success of those four countries has been in persuading the Sudanese Government and the rebel group, the Sudan People's Liberation Army, to set up corridors to help relief efforts get through.
About the only ray of hope seen by American officials is that the Government may feel pressed to end the war because Government troops have suffered so many casualties and the war has wreaked havoc on the north's economy.
Washington's complaint with the Sudan goes far beyond the Government's spring offensive, which has included bombing of camps with displaced people. The United States is also angry about the Sudanese Government's support of terrorist groups.
Having put the Sudan on its terrorism list, the United States treats Khartoum as a junior member of the rogue states that include Iraq and Iran. American officials say the Sudan has received many of its weapons from China while Iran has financed much of those purchases.
According to Administration officials, Ms. Wells's message to the Sudanese Government will be to stop sheltering terrorist organizations nad to stop human rights abuses.
Ms. Wells, a former Ambassador to Zaire, Mozambique and Guinea-Bissau, is refusing to comment on the Sudan situation until after her trip.

HEADLINE: Japan Is Considering Optical Fiber Network

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TOKYO, May 31

 BODY:
The Japanese Government is considering creating a multibillion-dollar communications network to connect every home and business in Japan with optical fibers by the year 2010.
The plan, which was recommended today by the Telecommunications Council, an influential Government advisory board, is expected to be adopted by the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications. It would form the core of Japan's response to similar plans in the United States for a national information infrastructure, sometimes called the information superhighway. As in the United States, most of the actual work would be left to the private sector. 
 Such a network would be costly. The council estimated that bringing fiber to 75 million subscribers by 2010 would cost between $300 billion and $500 billion, depending on the network's sophistication. Laying the cables underground would require an additional $400 billion.
 
N.T.T. Building Network
 The Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation, the nation's main telephone company, is already building a $400 billion nationwide optical network, which it intends to complete by the year 2015. The council's plan would speed that up by five years, although it is unclear how a new timetable could be enforced.
The source of the necessary financing is also not yet clear. But industry and Government officials here have grown increasingly worried that Japan is lagging behind the United States in advanced telecommunications and multimedia.
Japanese companies and consumers have largely stood by while the use of computer networks has mushroomed in the United States and while American telephone and cable companies have begun testing services like video on demand, home shopping and electronic libraries. The American companies are hoping to have fiber optics installed in most of their networks by early in the next decade, years ahead of the Japanese target.
 
Efficiency Is a Goal
 Developing its own information infrastructure would help Japan spawn new industries and make existing industries more efficient as the economy shifts from manufacturing to services. The Telecommunications Council also said the network could help relieve traffic congestion by promoting tele-commuting and providing such services as remote medical checkups to Japan's aging society.
The council recommended that the bulk of the network be built by the private sector, mainly telephone and cable television companies. But the report also suggested that the Government would help by providing tax incentives, low-interest loans and other inducements.
The advisory council also recommended that the Government lead in developing public service uses of the network, for health care and education, for example. This would help finance the network before commercial applications developed.
Analysts say that one reason that Japan has fallen behind is the strictness of telecommunications regulations, which have left Japanese cable television companies undercapitalized and fragmented. Only about 3 percent of households here subscribe to cable services in contrast to 60 percent in the United States.
 
Broadcasting a Separate Fief
 Broadcasting and telecommunications have been considered separate fiefs in Japan, even though new technology allows them to merge. N.T.T. would like to offer video services over its optical fiber network, but there is a concern that it would be powerful enough to wipe out the smaller and weaker cable companies.
The advisory board recommends reviewing regulations and possibly ending these industry distinctions.
Despite a late start, Japan's Government and industry are gearing up for many tests of advanced telephone and cable services. And American companies, notably Time Warner and Tele-Communications Inc. are entering the Japanese market.

HEADLINE: California's Fast-Forward Politics

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 31

 BODY:
Democrats and Republicans will go to the polls on June 7 to nominate candidates in the California Governor's race, but conventional political wisdom and opinion surveys long ago jumped ahead of the primaries and nominated two contenders: Gov. Pete Wilson, the Republican, and State Treasurer Kathleen Brown, the Democrat.
They have been squaring off for the better part of 15 months, and the latest polls show Mr. Wilson pulling closer to Ms. Brown. A single issue is dominating what is probably the most important state election in the country this year: the California economy, which is still struggling to pull out of a recession. Crime is an important secondary issue. 
 The other candidates seeking nomination on June 7 have failed to make close races of the primaries, the first stage of a contest in which voters will not only choose a leader for the most populous and politically potent state but also provide some hints about Presidential prospects in 1996.
The most recent voter surveys, one taken in mid-May by the Field Poll of San Francisco, and the other taken last week by The Los Angeles Times, found a Wilson-Brown contest growing tighter. Even though Ms. Brown spent several months retooling her staff and message while stepping up her campaign pace, Mr. Wilson had pulled to within about 10 percentage points. He had trailed by more than 20 points in the past 15 months.
 
Economy a Wilson Thorn
 But the new polls also indicate that the Governor has serious weaknesses, with more people giving him a "poor" rating than a "good" rating for the job he has done in his four-year term. Most of his detractors blame him for the weakness in the state's economy, while his defenders say he could have done little about the hard hits the state took from the national recession and military cuts.
"This race has all the makings of going down to the wire," said the director of the Field Poll, Mervin Field. "If the primaries seem already settled, the things that the other primary candidates are doing and have done, even if they're out of it, can still impact on Wilson and Brown."
Besides Ms. Brown, a 48-year-old centrist whose father and brother are both former Governors, there are two other Democratic primary candidates. They are Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi, a 49-year-old former State Senator with considerable personal wealth and a bent toward populism, and State Senator Tom Hayden, best remembered as one of the noisiest radicals of the 1960's but more recently, at the age of 54, a surprisingly soft voice for peaceful change.
In the new polls, Mr. Garamendi trails Ms. Brown by about 20 points and Mr. Hayden trails by about 35 points. Those margins have not changed much for months, despite heavy campaign spending by Mr. Garamendi and a number of complimentary reviews by political columnists and analysts for Mr. Hayden.
 
A Lone Republican Challenger
 In the Republican primary, besides Mr. Wilson, whose politics also tend to be centrist, there is only one other candidate. He is Ron Unz, a little known conservative who has made a fortune producing computer software in Silicon Valley and has not hesitated to spend some of it on his campaign. In the new polls, Mr. Unz, who is 32, trails the Governor, who is 60, by almost 20 points.
But by spending heavily on television and by relentlessly assailing the Governor, he has managed to win over about 30 percent of the likely Republican electorate, the polls say.
"When a political unknown wins away one of every three Republicans from a Republican incumbent, it serves notice that the incumbent has some real weakness to deal with," said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, an analyst at the Center for Politics and Economics at Claremont Graduate School. "Unz has been hitting Wilson on everything Californians worry most about: the economy, crime, taxes, you name it. He's the best thing that ever happened to Kathleen Brown."
Stung by Mr. Unz's attacks, Mr. Wilson agreed to a radio debate, a risky decision for a front-runner but one he decided would ultimately serve him well. Neither man overpowered the other in the debate, held on Friday, though Mr. Unz showed considerable stage presence and aggressiveness for a beginner. He went at Mr. Wilson again and again on the economy, asserting that he had not instituted enough programs to offset the loss of jobs from industry and military cutbacks.
 
Brown Ignores Opponents
 In a round of three television debates just completed by the Democrats, Ms. Brown concentrated on an all-out attack on Governor Wilson, not her primary opponents. Her opening line at each forum was, "I'm angry at Pete Wilson."
Ms. Brown also managed in the debates to fend off the most damaging blows from her Democratic challengers, though most analysts say Mr. Garamendi and Mr. Hayden scored points when she refused to say why she opposed capital punishment. Mr. Garamendi gave his unqualified support to capital punishment while Mr. Hayden said he supported it under certain circumstances.
Early in her campaign, Ms. Brown often stumbled when sharply questioned, and her basic message seemed at times to be unfocused. Some Democrats grumbled that she seemed to assume that her election was a foregone conclusion, given that her father, Edmund G. (Pat) Brown Sr., served as Governor from 1959 to 1967 and her brother, Edmund G. Brown Jr., served from 1975 to 1983.
She is making no assumptions about success now and takes pains to shape her own image, contending that she is neither as liberal as her father nor as New Age as her brother.
 
Long Days, One Issue
 Two months ago, she hired Clint Reilly, one of the state's top political consultants, to run her campaign. Today, her message is focused -- Pete Wilson, she says, has destroyed the California economy and with it the California dream -- and she campaigns 15 and 20 hours a day.
Mr. Wilson's gains in the latest polls might have been even greater had it not been for Mr. Reilly's work. "He's made the difference," said Ms. Jeffe, the political analyst.
Governor Wilson has taken a classic incumbent approach, relying heavily on state ceremonies, speeches and implementation of various programs to make his political points, and supplemented those activities with television advertising.
Mr. Wilson and Ms. Brown say they plan to spend heavily on television, which is more important in this hugely populous and diverse state than in any other.
At every opportunity, Mr. Wilson meets with police organizations and citizens groups to talk about crime. And he hammers repeatedly on the need for better control of illegal immigration, another issue of major concern in the state. "They keep coming," he says in one of his ads.
But so does the economic issue, and in the end, whatever else is debated, that is the subject that is likely to decide whether Pete Wilson or Kathleen Brown is the next Governor of California.

HEADLINE: Cuomo Looks Ahead to Good Old Days

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BUFFALO, May 31

 BODY:
As Gov. Mario M. Cuomo prepares to run for a fourth term, with his popularity dangerously low, he has been talking a lot about the good old days.
His approach is a politics of nostalgia, Cuomo-style, aimed at reminding voters why they once admired him. He pines for his chronological youth -- for days when jobs were plentiful and trouble on the streets meant fist fights, not guns and drugs. And he talks of his political youth as well: those glorious first two terms when New York's streaking economy and Mr. Cuomo's Presidential prospects made him one of the most popular governors in state history.
"Everybody says stop looking backward, look forward," said the 61-year-old Governor, who will be nominated here Wednesday at the convention of the Democratic State Committee. "But if you take those years '83 through '89, it's hard to separate them from my rationale. Those years were so good you wanted me to be President. I haven't changed." 
 To hear Mr. Cuomo tell it, a relentless recession ate away at his popularity like a persistent cancer, effectively stealing three years of his political life. He does not speak of the possibility that New Yorkers may also have grown weary of his unconsummated flirtations with the Presidency and the Supreme Court, his legalistic combativeness and his lack of an easily identifiable legacy after 12 years in office.
His approval rating dropped 41 percentage points between January 1988 and March 1994, to 36 percent from 77 percent, according to the Marist Institute for Public Opinion.
Now a recovery offers a chance at redemption, a return, if not to the pinnacle of six years ago, at least to a height that history may judge more admiringly.
A fourth election would secure his place among New York's most enduring political figures. If he wins and completes his four-year term, Mr. Cuomo would become the second-longest serving governor in state history, surpassing Nelson A. Rockefeller and trailing only George Clinton, the first governor, who served for 23 years over two periods.
Mr. Cuomo is too smart a politician to express his ambition so egocentrically. Instead, he speaks about the opportunity to finish a mission on behalf of New York that he says was interrupted by the state's fiscal collapse. But clearly, his friends and aides say, Mr. Cuomo's decision to run a fourth time also was motivated by his sense of history and his desire to finish on an ascent.
"In many ways, the decision to run again was a more profound choice for him than whether to run for President," said Meyer S. Frucher, a longtime Cuomo confidant. "He's the kind of political figure who will only run if he has a rationale. And I think he's really looking forward to an upturn, both governmentally and politically."
 
A 'Stronger, Sweeter' State
 At a fund-raiser last month, Mr. Cuomo recounted his last decision to run, in 1990, saying he felt an obligation to use his experience to help the state through the recession.
"Then, when the state is back on the right track, when we get this train on the track moving in the right direction again, back up toward the top of the mountain, then we'll get out," he said.
"The reason I'm running this time is I think that train is just about on the track. I think now we need another push and we're on our way to a society stronger, sweeter, more sensitive, more intelligent than the Empire State ever was."
Mr. Cuomo said in the same speech that he did not want to be remembered simply as a governor who balanced the state's budget during a recession. That task, which has occupied much of his last five years, was completed only through severe spending cuts, tax increases, , heavy borrowing and broken promises.
"I didn't come into government to be an accountant," he said. "If I could produce a balanced budget because the taxes were coming in very nicely and I paid all our bills but didn't take care of the problems of the needy and didn't help the struggling middle class, I would regard that budget as a sort of emblem of my hypocrisy."
 
Staying the Course
 And yet, Mr. Cuomo said in interviews over the weekend that he would propose no grand new social programs in a fourth term.
Instead, Mr. Cuomo said he would continue on the course set in this year's state budget: government investments in high technology and job-creating infrastructure projects; increased spending on education; aid to local governments aimed at helping them reduce property taxes, and cuts in state taxes that are large enough to encourage business expansion without fraying the social safety net.
After winning support this year for reductions in corporate income taxes and hotel taxes and the creation of a tax credit for the working poor, Mr. Cuomo said he would like to lower the state's utilities taxes next year. He is not yet sure the state can afford a major cut in the personal income tax, like the proposal that Gov. Christine Todd Whitman rode to victory in New Jersey last year. (He is also mindful that voters didn't buy the I-made-the-tough-choices argument made by Jim Florio, the incumbent that Mrs. Whitman defeated.)
Mr. Cuomo also said he would spend a lot of time in a fourth term campaigning for a constitutional convention. The state Constitution requires New Yorkers to vote in 1997, 20 years after the last similar referendum, on whether to hold a convention. Mr. Cuomo has come to belief that the only way to win approval of initiatives like public campaign financing and stricter regulation of lobbying is to bypass the Legislature.
Central to Mr. Cuomo's rationale for running this year is the notion that he, like many governors, was an unwitting victim of the recession. He argues that the loss of more than 500,000 jobs from 1989 through 1993 was thrust upon New York by a changing world economy and the fiscal policies of Republican presidents.
 
'Not Future, but Fault'
 "We were hit from behind, not by a New York-bred disaster, but by a national recession," he said.
Much of the 1994 campaign will be spent debating that proposition. At the Republican state convention in Manhattan last week, the party's designated gubernatorial candidate, State Senator George E. Pataki, blamed the shrinkage of the state's job market on Mr. Cuomo's policies on taxation, spending and debt. As he spoke, delegates to the convention chanted: "It's Mario's fault."
Mr. Cuomo said the slogan only proves what he has long said about Republicans, that they campaign negatively. "The best word they could think of was 'fault,' not 'future,' but 'fault,' " he said.
Although many Cuomo aides have a grudging respect for the ticket assembled at the Republican convention last week, Mr. Cuomo plans to take advantage of the opening provided by Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato's heavy backroom role.
The Governor already has appropriated the analogy drawn by Herbert London, Mr. Pataki's one-time foe and current running mate, that Mr. Pataki is playing Charlie McCarthy to Mr. D'Amato's Edgar Bergen.
"I'm glad they didn't talk about Pinocchio and Geppetto because that would have been ethnic," Mr. Cuomo joked. (Although Mr. Cuomo can, on occasion, make fun of his heritage, his ethnic sensitivity has not waned. When a reporter used the word "vendetta" in a question earlier this year, Mr. Cuomo said he was sure there must be a synonym with a Gaelic derivative.)
 
Not a Pliable Candidate
 The Cuomo campaign also plans to portray Mr. Pataki as an empty suit without either experience nor convictions. Whenever possible, they said, they will attempt to exploit the stature gap they see between Mr. Cuomo and his opponent.
But above all, Cuomo aides said, the campaign's first mission is to reconnect with voters who may consider the Governor a distant presence. A man who excels at raising money and pressing the flesh, Mr. Cuomo dislikes doing both. He would much rather stay home and read or watch CNN and the Discovery Channel.
"We have to remind people that he's a human being who cares about people and the state," said one Cuomo aide, who insisted on anonymity.
The aide said that Mr. Cuomo was not an easy candidate to manage.
"When you ask him to explain why he's running, he wants to write an appellate brief," the aide said. "When you tell him that it will make a big difference if he takes off his jacket, he just doesn't accept that viscerally."
Campaign officials said that Mr. Cuomo's media consultant, David Garth, who has played an active but strictly behind-the-scenes role thus far, was preparing commercials featuring voter-in-the-street testimonials to the Governor that may be aired shortly after the convention.
But Mr. Cuomo's future may depend, as it has so often in the past, on his own eloquence and his ability to relate the past to the future.
"The job simply isn't done," Mr. Cuomo said on CNN's Larry King Live two weeks ago. "I think I can be helpful because of my experience, of my background. Because the job is not done, I want to finish it."

HEADLINE: Homes Sales and Spending Slump in Signs of a Slowing

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 31

 BODY:
Fresh signs of economic slowing emerged today as new-home sales and personal spending slumped in April after two months of hefty gains, Government figures showed today.
And consumer confidence slipped in May, according to a tabulation by the Conference Board, with seven of nine regions posting declines. New England and the South Atlantic were the exceptions. 
 The latest economic figures, which were generally weaker than expected, reflected to various degrees the twin bites of higher interest rates and higher income taxes, analysts said.
Today's reports followed the Government's recalculation of first-quarter growth on Friday, raising total output in the first quarter to an annual pace of 3 percent, up from an initial estimate of 2.6 percent but far below the 7 percent surge in the final three months of 1993, when a sharp rise in the refinancing of home mortgages greatly swelled household buying power.
The downbeat economic news, a sign of inflation in control, helped the bond market bounce off its lows yesterday but a jump in commodity prices rekindled inflation fears and the market declined, driving interest rates higher. [Page D14.]
"The second quarter is off to a rather poor start," said Lacy H. Hunt, chief economist at HSBC Holdings Inc. in New York. "At a time when the economy needs help from the interest-sensitive sectors to overcome tax increases, the interest-sensitive sectors are a drag."
Exhibit A, many economists contended, is housing. Sales of new one-family homes in April skidded 6.8 percent to an annual rate of 683,000, today's report by the Departments of Commerce and Housing and Urban Development showed. Sales fell 16.9 percent in the Northeast, 14.1 percent in the South and 5.7 percent in the West. The Midwest, however, posted a 16.9 percent gain.
"It looks like it's primarily the interest rates," said David F. Seiders, chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders. Although the Federal Reserve began raising short-term interest rates only in February, mortgage rates have been moving up since October and the early benefit of fence-sitters being pushed to act has now all but disappeared.
Legions of first-time buyers, some of whom would presumably have found a home to buy during the winter had it not been for exceptionally harsh weather, now find themselves priced out of the market.
 
Inventory Edges Up
 During April the stock of unsold new homes edged up less than 1 percent, to 302,000, but because of the slower selling pace this inventory would last 5.3 months, up from 4.9 months in March.
The actual number of homes sold, with no annualization or seasonal adjustment, was 66,000 last month, the same as in April 1993, the Department also found. The average sales price eased $200, to $153,900.
Nor did economists find much comfort in the Commerce Department's report showing that personal income rose four-tenths of 1 percent of in April, one-third the average increase for February and March.
They noted that disposable income fell two-tenths of 1 percent, the difference largely ascribed to tax increases that many wealthier households paid in the days approaching April 15.
This drain no doubt contributed to a slight, one-tenth of 1 percent easing in personal spending, which had been a major source of the economy's recent strength.
 
'Tempo Has Changed'
 "Today's report is further evidence that the economy's tempo has changed," commented Robert D. Barr of the United States Chamber of Commerce. "After the frenetic flash dancing of late last year, households are moving to a softer, slower beat."
Not all analysts, however, were disappointed by today's statistics, which also included private-sector surveys of store sales and of purchasing managers in the Chicago area.
Paul Mastroddi, economist at J. P. Morgan, called the decline in home sales "quite muted" and said he found strength -- even price pressures -- in the report on Chicago manufacturing.
He said the bank was staying with its projection of a 6 percent annual growth rate in the economy for the current quarter, one of the most optimistic forecasts.
 
Confidence Slips
 The report on confidence from the Conference Board, a business-sponsored research group in New York, showed its index slipping 4.5 points in May, to 87.6 on a scale designating 1985 as 100.
"Although confidence retreated in May, the current reading continues to be at a fairly reassuring level," said Fabian Linden, executive director of the organization's Conumer Research Center.
Respondents this time were "considerably" less positive in their appraisal of current conditions -- down to 78.9 from 87.1 -- but only "moderately" less optimistic in what they expect over the coming six months -- to 93.5 from 95.4 -- the board reported.

HEADLINE: Herbert Bienstock, 71, Official Who Invested Figures With Flair

BYLINE: By RONALD SULLIVAN 

 BODY:
Herbert Bienstock, a former regional commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics with the Department of Labor, died on Monday at his home in Bayside, Queens.
He was 71 and died of a heart attack, his family said. 
 Mr. Bienstock was principal spokesman on statistics for the Labor Department, covering a region that included New York, New Jersey, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and the Canal Zone, until he retired in 1979.
 
Spicing Up Reports
 He was known for enlivening the government's monthly Consumer Price Index reports and for making the figures meaningful for consumers. For instance, he urged the public to eat turkeys when their prices dropped and even suggested stuffing them with green peppers when they were a bargain.
"An economic, if not a gastronomical, delight," he said at the time.
Mr. Bienstock told the public what was behind the cost of a steak or a new car, and why buying a chicken (fresh, not frozen) might be a prudent investment.
Mr. Bienstock served as commissioner through nearly two decades, recording the wave of Government spending in the 1960's and the recession that hit New York City in 1970 and held for 10 years.
During his tenure, he became an authority on human resources, employment and the growing problem of youths who could not find jobs.
In 1983, three years after his retirement and a professor of labor and urban values at Queens College, he described teen-age unemployment as at its worst in the city's history.
"We are living through a period of a teen-age employment disaster," he said. "What has it done to the teen-agers and the city? We have created a lost generation."
Throughout his career, Mr. Bienstock combined a social conscience with a love of statistics -- almost, he said, making figures speak for themselves.
But then, he also asked in 1975, "What can you say with figures? It all needs explaining."
Educated in New York City public schools, Mr. Bienstock was graduated from City College in 1945 when he joined the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
He was appointed regional commissioner in 1962. He also was a visiting lecturer and adjunct professor at Yeshiva University, the Hunter College Graduate School of Education, Baruch College, the New School for Social Research, Pace University's Graduate School of Business Administration, and at Cornell University's School of Industrial and Labor Relations. He also was the author of numerous articles dealing with employment.
In 1970, City College awarded Mr. Bienstock the Townsend Harris Medal, for "Outstanding Achievement" in his chosen field. He was a fellow of the American Statistical Association and a member of the board of directors of the National Conference of Christians and Jews Mobilization for Youth.
He also helped found the Hebrew Academy, an elementary school in Bayside.
Mr. Bienstock is survived by his wife, June; a daughter, Ruth Bienstock Anolik, of Penn Valley, Penn.; a son, Joshua, of Fresh Meadows, L.I.; a sister, Clara Schneider, of Bayside; and three grandchildren.

850 Workers At Chrysler Go on Strike

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: DETROIT, May 31

 BODY:
About 850 salaried workers who design Chrysler cars and trucks walked off the job this morning in a dispute between the auto maker and the United Automobile Workers union over subcontracting work to nonunion workers and companies.
The workers who went on strike earn $16 to $27 an hour as draftsmen, clay modelers, designers and clerical assistants, said David Corless, financial secretary of U.A.W. Local 412 in Warren, Mich. The union, he said, objects to the hiring of nonunion companies to do similar work and to having nonunion workers stand "shoulder to shoulder" with union members at the technical center. 
 Nonunion workers earn about the same salaries, Mr. Corless said, "but the company wants as little as possible to do with pensions, job security pay" and other benefits for which nonunion workers do not qualify. In the last 20 years, Mr. Corless said, the number of workers represented by the union has shrunk from about 1,650 to the current total of 850 as Chrysler has channeled more contracts to the outside.
 
Tentative Agreement Reached

Lee Sechler, a Chrysler spokesman, declined to comment on the dispute.
A second group, of about 400 salaried and some hourly maintenance workers, also employed at Chrysler's technical center in Auburn Hills, Mich., tentatively reached a settlement today. The workers will vote on the proposed contract on Thursday.
Although the three United States auto makers signed new three-year master contracts last fall covering general terms of pay and benefits, each union local must also reach agreement with plant or workplace managers. Reaching local agreements has sometimes proved troublesome, a result of the industry's current boom.
The union believes extra help is needed in factories, but auto makers prefer not to give the work to the union since doing so may mean paying job security benefits when the economy slows down.
 
Complaint About Overtime
 The union, on the other hand, complains that workers are working too much overtime and need help to prevent repetitive-stress injuries and other job-related health problems.
Separately, union negotiators representing 11,500 General Motors Corporation assembly and components workers in Flint, Mich., were scheduled to meet with company representatives to resolve complaints about the speed-up of operations.
G.M. officials, eager to meet strong vehicle demand by retail customers, wants to increase the line speed at its Buick City assembly plant to 72 or 73 vehicles an hour from 67. Buick City assembles the Buick LeSabre, Park Avenue and Oldsmobile 88 sedans. The union wants to add 300 to 500 new workers to handle the load.
G.M. workers in Flint, members of U.A.W. Local 599, voted 6,220 to 1,022 last week to strike if a settlement was not reached.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Midwest Dry Spell Causes Rally in Corn and Soybeans

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Dry weather in the Midwest touched off a rally in corn and soybean futures prices yesterday that pulled other commodity prices upward, reviving inflation fears. Precious metals, coffee, cocoa and crude oil all gained, while livestock and meat futures ended mixed.
The Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 commodities rose 4.54 points, to 235.42. Many financial experts consider the index an early inflation indicator. 
 A similar broad-based commodities rally collapsed last week when rain fell in the Midwest, where most of the country's corn and soybeans are grown.
David Rothberg, a commodities analyst at Friedberg Mercantile Group in Toronto, said the roiling prices signaled an underlying strength in the market.
"This kind of volatility, this kind of itchiness, is typical of a bull market," he said.
 
Little Rainfall in Midwest
 Most corn and soybean contracts rose their permitted daily limits on the Chicago Board of Trade as traders returned from the long weekend to reports of little rainfall in the Midwest and forecasts for mostly dry weather this week.
After the close of trading, the Agriculture Department reported 79 percent of the corn crop was in good to excellent condition as of Sunday. Twenty percent was fair and 1 percent poor.
Soybean planting was 78 percent complete as of Sunday, the Department of Agriculture said in the weekly report.
Wheat for July delivery rose 9 1/2 cents, to $3.27 1/2 a bushel; July corn rose the 12-cent limit, to $2.78 3/4 a bushel; July oats rose 4 3/4 cents, to $1.25 1/4 a bushel; July soybeans rose 27 cents, to $7.01 a bushel.
Inflation jitters drove precious metals higher on the Commodity Exchange in New York. June gold rose $2.40, to $387.10 a troy ounce; July silver climbed 7.5 cents, to $5.55 a troy ounce.
On the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York, unroasted coffee beans for July delivery surged 4.7 cents, to $1.26 a pound; July cocoa beans rose $52, to $1,388 a ton.
 
Crude Oil Prices Rise
 Refined products led crude oil higher on the New York Mercantile Exchange as the June gasoline and heating oil contracts expired in typically volatile fashion.
Crude oil rose 28 cents, to $18.31 a barrel; June heating oil surged 1.33 cents, to 49.71 cents a gallon; June unleaded gasoline climbed 1.09 cents, to 53.30 cents a gallon; July natural gas rose 7.5 cents, to $1.917 for 1,000 cubic feet.
In livestock trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, June live cattle rose 0.80 cent, to 66.27 cents a pound; August feeder cattle fell 0.65 cent, to 73.95 cents a pound; June live hogs rose 0.08 cent, to 47.60 cents a pound; July frozen pork bellies fell 0.32 cent, to 41.50 cents a pound.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Rises Against Yen On Trade-Talks Optimism

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar rose against the yen and most other major currencies yesterday, buoyed by optimism that the United States and Japan will make progress in trade negotiations set to resume this week.
United States officials will begin talks in Tokyo today on insurance services, a spokeswoman for the United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, said yesterday. Talks on autos and auto parts are scheduled to start in Washington this week, she said. 
 "The dollar's fate depends on whether the trade talks with Japan are successful," said Karl Halligan, a trader at ING Capital Markets. "That's what everyone is waiting to see."
In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar was quoted at 104.75 yen, up from 104.30 yen on Friday. Currency markets in London and New York were closed Monday for holidays and post-holiday trading was light as many market participants extended their holiday weekend.
 
Bearishness in Europe
 The dollar also rose after the Bundesbank canceled a bond offering for the second time in one week, prompting a selloff in Germany and other European government debt markets as well. Traders said the trend might spread to other mark-based investments if such bearishness continued, depressing the German currency further. The dollar rose yesterday to 1.6467 marks from 1.6466 marks on Friday.
The New Zealand dollar rallied yesterday after the Government said it expected a surplus of $422 million in the fiscal year ending June 30, the first in 16 years. The New Zealand dollar rose to 59.49 United States cents in late trading today, its highest level since April 1991. It was quoted at 58.84 cents in New York on Friday.
Higher commodity prices also helped the New Zealand, Australian and Canadian dollars gain yesterday. Those currencies often rise alongside commodities because raw materials account for large proportions of the countries' exports.
The Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 commodity prices jumped 4.54 points, to 235.42 yesterday, driven by higher soybean, corn and coffee prices. The index rose to a three-and-a-half-year high of 239.20 on May 24.
The index is a closely watched inflation measure and its increase prompted talk that the Federal Reserve would again raise short-term interest rates. But traders said the market had not yet focused on such a move by the Fed's policy-making committee, which is scheduled to meet July 5 and 6.
The British pound was quoted at $1.5110 late yesterday, up from $1.5105 late Friday. The dollar rose to 5.6310 French francs from 5.6163 francs, and strengthened to 1.4037 Swiss francs from 1.4020 francs. The dollar rose to 1,593 Italian lire yesterday from 1,589 lire on Friday.

HEADLINE: Ukraine: Not for the Fainthearted

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: KIEV, Ukraine

 BODY:
S. C. Johnson & Son Inc., the $3 billion family-owned company that makes clothes, floor wax, furniture cleaners, bug killers and air fresheners, has traditionally been challenged by new frontiers.
When the company opened a plant in Britain 80 years ago, it was one of the first American corporations to go abroad. At the end of the cold war, it trailblazed again -- this time into the uncertain precincts of Ukraine. 
 Doing business amid the political and economic turmoil here is not for the fainthearted. Only Johnson Wax, as the company is popularly known; Tambrands, which makes Tampax; some cigarette companies, and Pepsi-Cola have ventured from the West into this intriguing market of 52 million people.
Johnson Wax's experience since late in 1990 -- when the company started to make and bottle detergents and furniture polish in a renovated corner of a ramshackle factory on the outskirts of Kiev -- helps explain the reluctance of other consumer-products companies to jump in.
A few months after Ukraine joined Russia and Belarus in leaving the crumbling Soviet Union, it introduced a coupon currency to replace the ruble. In relatively short order, the coupons became all but worthless. By late last year, inflation had reached about 100 percent a month, from almost zero two years before. A fierce credit squeeze by the Government left wholesalers little money to buy Johnson's products. And a Government that initially promised to create a friendly environment for Western investors became encrusted with old-style -- many say, corrupt -- former Communists.
Last year, Johnson Wax halved its production from that of 1992. And almost half of 1993's 10 million bottles that came off the assembly line had to be sold in Russia, where the economy, however turbulent, is far stronger than Ukraine's.
But Johnson Wax had been prepared for the long haul, said Franck Benhamou, 34, the general manager of S. C. Johnson in Kiev. Unlike Tambrands, which had to import new machinery, Johnson had to bring in less and was able to spruce up some existing Ukrainian equipment. So far, the company has invested less than $10 million. The original target remains the same: the entire, vast market of the former Soviet Union.
"We're building a brand, we're building a work force and we're building a factory," Mr. Benhamou said, showing off a large, airy and freshly painted building where production takes place. "This will enable us to be a competitor. The problem is not knowing what is going to happen. If it takes off, we will be in a good position."
The key to keeping going in Ukraine is to stay nimble, Mr. Benhamou said. Until early in 1993, the plant could not keep up with demand, especially for a laundry detergent, Hello; a liquid starch, Jubilee, and a pre-spotter for clothes, Bioshout. Ukrainians love to starch their clothes, even their bed sheets. These products sell for the equivalent of $1 in a country where industrial wages run $150 a month or less.
"We could sell everything we made and more," Mr. Benhamou said of the 20 million bottles of detergent and other products produced in 1992. "There was money in the country, we barely had a sales department -- there was no need to sell. People were lining up to buy it."
One enthusiastic customer, Olga Stepanovich, a 22-year-old newlywed, elaborated. "The local washing powders are too rough for silks and wools," she said as she searched the shelves in a store here for Hello. "We used to send our sweaters and blouses to the dry cleaners, but dry cleaning has become so expensive."
Mrs. Stepanovich said she could not easily find the detergent in the stores anymore.
The reason is a Government credit squeeze. Johnson demanded payment in advance from wholesalers, in order to insure payment in a volatile credit market and protect itself against inflation.
But after March 1993, the wholesalers found it almost impossible to get credit. Johnson could no longer rely on its regular wholesalers, and new ones were yet to emerge.
 
Blessings in Deep Disguise
 Yet, the slide in Ukrainian sales proved to be less of a blow than it might have been. Johnson had already started selling in Russia, not so much to find new customers but to earn rubles it could use to buy raw ingredients there. About 80 percent of ingredients in the detergent, as well as the plastic used in making the bottles, come from Russia.
"When Ukraine exited the ruble zone, all of a sudden we couldn't buy raw material," Mr. Benhamou said, alluding to Ukraine's coupon currency. "We had been buying raw materials in Russia, but to continue to do so we had to quickly generate sales in Russia."
An overhaul of the poorly maintained plant Johnson acquired in 1990 has just begun. Aluminum window frames are replacing rusted metal ones. Smaller, more powerful engines to turn the detergent-mining vats are being imported. Western floors are replacing broken concrete.
The overhaul was delayed when Johnson's local partner, Ukrbytkhim, which makes shampoo and detergent, failed to live up to an agreement that it would move out of the building. Only after pushing the case to the highest reaches of the Ukrainian Government has Johnson won a three-year battle for control of the building, Mr. Benhamou said.
The plant's original work force of 700 has been whittled down to 300, with the departing local partner taking many of the workers. For those remaining, initial nervousness about working for a Western company has subsided.
"They thought we'd leave and then they'd be sent to Siberia," Mr. Benhamou said.
A major attraction for Western manufacturers here is low wages. Johnson would like to raise the pay of some workers above the monthly $150 that the best get, but a 92 percent tax rate on earned income above $150 makes it impossible to do so, Mr. Benhamou said.
Thefts, endemic at state enterprises where workers make up for low salaries by taking products, barely occurs at Johnson Wax, Mr. Benhamou said. Early instances were dealt with by dismissals.
 
Phones Work Now
 Some improvements in everyday life make the difficulty of doing business here a little easier. To make an overseas telephone call took two days several years ago. Now they can be made on the spot. And there are more flights in and out of the country.
But unpredictability prevails. In the last six months, the Ukrainian Government has raised or lowered the value-added tax rate three times. Now there are worries that the Government might impose an excise tax on supplies coming across the border from Russia. And still another currency is expected, prompting further headaches.
In the long run, Mr. Benhamou said, it is the gritty preparation that Johnson Wax has put into Ukraine that will determine success.
"How much money does the competition have to spend three years down the road to reach our level is the question," he said. "If they have to spend much more money than we have to match us, it was a good bet."

Japan's unemployment rate stood at a seasonally adjusted 2.8 percent in April, down one-tenth of a percentage point from March, the Government announced today. The number of unemployed people totaled 1.94 million in April, up 23.6 percent from a year earlier but below the 2.08 million people reported in March. Japan's unemployment rate would be higher if calculated by United States or European methods. In Japan, people working more than one hour in the last week of the month and all members of the armed forces are counted as employed.

HEADLINE: Critic's Notebook;
The First Spoleto Without Menotti

BYLINE: By JAMES R. OESTREICH, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: CHARLESTON, S.C., May 29

 BODY:
"A fake festival," Gian Carlo Menotti called it from afar on the CBS program "Sunday Morning." Odd, but the real thing seemed to be happening in the teeming streets right outside my hotel window here as the city was awakening to the fifth day of the Spoleto Festival U.S.A.
Mr. Menotti, who founded the event in 1977 and guided it through 17 seasons, is, of course, entitled to his bias. And the current season, which runs through next Sunday, might not have been to his liking in any case. But he was not speaking from firsthand experience. In fact, Mr. Menotti has had no contact with the festival or the city of Charleston since he resigned as artistic director in October after a protracted series of squabbles, which need no further rehearsal here. 
 "We've had no communication from him," said Joseph P. Riley Jr., the Mayor of Charleston, who was one of Mr. Menotti's staunchest allies through the time of troubles.
What seems remarkable to a first-time visitor to the festival is how quickly and well it has picked up the pieces. Even before Mr. Menotti's departure, it had announced that because of an accumulated $1 million deficit, the season would be cut back from 17 days to 12 this year, and offer many fewer events.
Milton Rhodes, the former director of the American Council for the Arts in New York, became the general manager of Spoleto in November and wiped the programming slate clean. Mr. Rhodes, who took over the council in 1985 in a state of near-bankruptcy and built it back up, also determined to put the festival on sound financial footing.
And to do so, the 49-year-old Mr. Rhodes, who was born in North Charleston and knows the social and economic terrain, did some smooth talking. He persuaded creditors to write off $400,000 of debt, including $130,000 owed to the Westminster Choir College and $97,000 owed to the city.
"I told them if they wanted the festival to continue, they would have to forgive the debt," he said. "We needed the money to keep from going under. It was as simple as that." He negotiated a loan from the state to cover the remaining $600,000 deficit.
The loss of the festival would have been an economic blow to the area in the best of times. "It has an economic impact of $73 million on the state and a $43 million impact on the region," said Mayor Riley, who is running for Governor. The festival, he added, has been largely responsible for the restoration of the old parts of the city and the revitalization of the downtown area.
In addition, a loss of the festival just now would be doubly awkward, since the city is about to lose the Charleston Naval Base as part of the base closings announced in Washington last year. (There is talk of a threat to the Charleston Air Force Base, but Mayor Riley dismisses the possibility.)
There is also the matter of prestige. BMW, the German auto maker, is about to open a $350 million plant near Spartanburg, S.C., and both Mr. Rhodes and Mayor Riley argue that the festival's presence in the state was a crucial factor in the choice of location. Indeed, in a nice symbiosis, BMW sponsored one of the two opera productions this year, "Fidelio," and Mr. Rhodes said he hoped to persuade the company eventually to pick up the entire opera tab.
One way or another, Mr. Rhodes seems to have accomplished Phase 1 of his plan, which was simply to mount a festival this year and make it work. He pieced together a triumvirate of artistic directors with past ties to the festival: Spiros Argiris, a symphonic and operatic conductor; Joseph Flummerfelt, the choral conductor, and Charles Wadsworth, the pianist and chamber-music specialist. He filled the 12 days with almost as many events as were presented last year, and he reported on Saturday that the day before had been the biggest in the festival's history in terms of ticket sales. He also expanded the festival's educational programs.
Phase 2 is to begin long-range planning and settle on the programming for next season. Mr. Rhodes does not yet know whether a full 17 days will again be possible (as the hotel owners and other vendors in the city fondly hope), but he said he was giving the idea "a strong look."
Phase 3, he said, involves long-term financial planning for future solvency. Here, Mr. Rhodes carries over some perspective from his last job.
"We haven't yet found a mechanism in this country for long-range financing in the arts," he said. "Generally, the management is good, but we're still scraping for every penny. And every five years or so the ox lands in the ditch because we have no ongoing base of support except our own."
For the moment, the Spoleto ox seems to be back on course and moving resolutely forward, but Mr. Rhodes is not ready to make any grand claims. "I don't have any idea how any of these plans are going to turn out," he said, "but I feel good about Phase 1."
As well he might. He has already achieved some much-needed peace, quiet and stability, and in a setting that has already proved fruitful under propitious circumstances, prosperity may well be the next step.
 
A Multi-media Message
 One of the more unusual happenings at the festival this year is "Box Conspiracy: An Interactive Sho," a multimedia musical comedy by George Coates, with a score by Marc Ream. Communications technology is its subject and its reason for being. As it shows the ultimately baleful effects of an imagined 5,000-channel interactive cable system (thus one of the many meanings of "box") on the life of a family, it celebrates some of the same technology by surrounding live actors with computer-generated effects amounting in some instances to virtual reality.
The play itself hardly transcends sitcom level and, as such, goes on far too long. Viewers, fitted out with 3D glasses and subjected to a relentless electronic rhythm track, are made to feel constrained in a box of their own, and the fascination of all the gimmickry quickly gives way to sensory overload.
Yet every so often on Sunday afternoon the music jolted the slumping viewer bolt upright. Not that it was ever profound or always well wrought, but it was superbly rendered. Of the three live players, Sheldon Born, a saxophonist, stood out. More impressive still were two of the singers, Susan Fatma Volkan and, especially, Raz Kennedy. Mr. Kennedy, who has worked with Bobby McFerrin, sang, wailed, almost yodeled at times, with an unfailing musicality that riveted the attention.
Anomalously, perhaps, one listener harked back to Friday evening, when a previously unknown tenor, Johan Botha, had brought the desultory "Fidelio" production to life in an instant by dint of sheer vocal prowess. Mr. Botha cut an unprepossessing figure onstage and lacked much in subtlety, but he sang the demanding role of Florestan with easy strength, unforced plangency and considerable tonal beauty.
Both productions had gone to considerable lengths to create drama, or at least distraction, yet once the power of real, accomplished vocalization took hold, everything else fell from view. Amid a few lost hours, it was good to be reminded, not once but twice, how much drama is inherent in the oldest, if not simplest, musical medium of all. We hear it so seldom nowadays.

Time to Act on Haiti

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
A few years ago when I was on an assignment in Haiti, a man took me to the back of his pickup truck and pointed to two young children. They were sitting in the bed of the truck and both were shivering, although the evening was quite warm. It was obvious that they were ill.
The man said the children were his and he begged me to smuggle them into the United States, where they would be safe and "grow strong." After listening to me explain how that was impossible, the man quietly said thank you, and with an expression of absolute despair, climbed into the cab of the truck and drove away. 
There was nothing unusual about the condition of the children in the truck, or the plight of their father. Hunger, disease, poverty and ignorance are staples of life in Haiti, a place where centuries of exploitation have thrown the vast majority of the people into a thoroughly wretched existence.
In the two and a half years since President Jean-Bertrand Aristide was ousted in a coup, the misery has only intensified. The combination of ferocious political repression unleashed by the coup leaders and the international sanctions that were supposed to drive them from power have made a terrible situation worse.
If the United States is going to intervene militarily in Haiti, it should do so soon. Prolonging the sanctions (even the new, improved version), when they are causing such hardship for ordinary Haitians while at the same time having so little impact on the renegade Government, is both cruel and indefensible.
President Clinton has spelled out why he feels the United States has a special interest in Haiti, and why the use of force to restore President Aristide is being considered. Haiti is "in our backyard," Mr. Clinton said, and it is the only country in the Western Hemisphere in which the military has seized power from an elected leader. Haiti and Cuba are the only two countries in the hemisphere that are not democratic.
President Clinton also noted that if democracy was not restored to Haiti, the United States at some point would face an enormous surge of new refugees seeking to settle here. (Keeping those refugees out has been the cornerstone of American policy to date.) Other points of special interest, according to Mr. Clinton, include the thousands of Americans who live in Haiti and the one million Haitian-Americans who live here. Finally, there is the fact that Haiti has become a staging area for drug shipments to the United States.
Mr. Clinton did not mention the important role the United States Government has played in the exploitation of the Haitian people. This has occurred through U.S. Government support -- both direct and covert -- for a series of repressive regimes, and through the long-term exploitation of cheap Haitian labor by American businesses. The U.S. has an interest in acknowledging those abuses, and in making the effort to act as a friend rather than an oppressor of the Haitian people.
The military in Haiti believes it has won its battle of the wills with the United States. "Sometimes," said an American diplomat, "the military leaders believe we were never serious about restoring Aristide, and other times they think we may have been serious but lacked the will. Either way they have felt triumphant."
Almost no one, in or out of the Clinton Administration, believes that the sanctions alone will drive the military leaders from power. Actually it is wrong to call them military leaders -- they are thugs, a band of murderers, rapists, terrorists and drug dealers who have all but demolished the fragile democratic infrastructure that was in place at the time of Father Aristide's election in December 1990.
A report on Haiti published last March by the U.S. Army War College said, "We have seriously misread the Haitian military and its allies, ascribing to them a degree of reasonableness and flexibility that does not exist."
President Clinton cannot bluff the leaders of the coup in Haiti. And he should not continue the added misery of the sanctions indefinitely. If the United States is going to lead an invasion, then the time to move is near. Nothing less than a genuine threat of force will dislodge the coup.

HEADLINE: Invade Haiti? A Sure Way To Make a Bad Policy Worse

BYLINE: By Brent Scowcroft and Eric D. K. Melby; Brent Scowcroft, national security adviser to Gerald R. Ford and George Bush, is president of the Forum for International Policy, a foundation. Eric D. K. Melby, a National Security Council staff member in the Bush Administration, is a senior associate at the Forum.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The United States is in danger of making a bad situation in Haiti even worse. We seem to be laying the groundwork for military intervention, which would get us into a quagmire.
If the Administration orders an invasion to restore President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, it will be making a grave mistake. There are better ways to help the democratic process. 
 Even if, given our superior forces, Father Aristide were back in office within a few days, in the long run an occupation would immerse us in the morass of Haitian nation-building -- a futile exercise, surely. Haiti has struggled unsuccessfuly with this task for nearly two centuries.
The Clinton Administration inherited a Bush Administration policy toward Haiti that was dead in the water. Its own approach has also been flawed. It has mistakenly embraced Father Aristide, who has shown no flexibility. It has tightened economic sanctions, which will increase the regime's black-market profits and the misery of the Haitian people. This, in turn, will increase the number of refugees, threatening to make the proposed offshore processing of them an insurmountable task.
When it becomes clear that the new policies will not work, the Administration, if we understand its hints, will resort to invasion.
Even if Father Aristide were returned to office behind the bayonets of a multinational force sponsored by the United Nations or the U.S., what then? The Haitian military and its paramilitary allies would fade out of sight to undertake guerrilla activities against the occupying force.
An occupation would not be the clean operation that some interventionists imagine, even with our overwhelming power; we could expect casualties and humiliations reminiscent of those in Somalia.
We might even succeed in uniting the disparate Haitian political forces against us. We would be dragged into settling their differences, but predictably could not satisfy various factions; in the end, we would wind up scapegoats.
Additionally, unilateral intervention would stir up long-standing anti-interventionist sentiment in the Southern Hemisphere.
In short, returning Father Aristide to Port-au-Prince would be the beginning, not the end, of Washington's problems. He would have to be sustained in power -- we would have to protect his life -- at least through the end of his term, in December 1995. (Or longer, according to his calculations. He maintains that his term was interrupted when he was deposed in December 1991, eight months after he took office and a year after he was elected.) And given Father Aristide's tendencies, once in power he might negate our attempts to sow the seeds of democracy in Haiti.
Our brief invasions of Grenada and Panama provide no justification for overrunning Haiti. In both cases, our goals were limited and involved no nation-building. Even the House, on May 24, approved a resolution opposing military intervention.
There is a better approach. The White House ought to drop Father Aristide permanently. Hardly a democrat, he is part of the problem, not the solution. Although he is the product of an election, his authoritarian behavior while in office briefly does not augur well for democracy. Moreover, despite the Administration's embrace of Father Aristide, he has bitten the hand that has been trying to feed him by refusing to compromise with his opponents.
Instead, together with the Organization of American States we should press for negotiations with Haiti's military regime. Our object would be to start building a democratic process, beginning with a new presidential election as soon as suitable procedures could be put in place.
This would require several things: the departure of today's military leaders from power; barring Father Aristide from returning (other democrats can be found to support); international observers for proper elections; dismantling all paramilitary organizations, and a multinational effort to professionalize the Haitian military and police.
To put pressure on the military leaders to negotiate a transfer of power, we should continue the tough sanctions against them personally: no international recognition, no traveling abroad, no access to their frozen financial and property assets overseas.
Although the international sanctions against Haiti's leaders themselves should continue, the trade sanctions against Haiti should be lifted: they punish innocent people and add to their misery, including forcing them into boats to flee to the U.S., only to be turned back. In any case, all the sanctions since 1991 have been ineffective; instead of coercing the military into accepting the return of Father Aristide, they are providing black-market profits to the military and its allies.
We should be encouraging the private sector in the U.S. to resume economic operations in Haiti, a major source of income for the impoverished Haitians.
Ending our support for Father Aristide should induce the military leaders to cooperate with us, because they would no longer have to fear for their lives if he returned: we would be offering them a face-saving way out. It would help break the deadlock while relieving the Haitians' economic hardship, which has gained us nothing.
Those contemplating direct involvement in nation-building ought to hark back to our occupation of Haiti from 1914 to 1933. When we arrived, we encountered no vestige of democracy; when we departed, we left none. An invasion today would very likely lead to the same result.

The Nurse Paradigm

BYLINE: By ANNA QUINDLEN 

 BODY:
An apple a day keeps the nurse away? Don't worry, you'll get used to the idea.
Because one of the most revolutionary parts of health care reform in America is bound to be the burgeoning role that nurses will play, including providing many of the services that were once confined to physicians. Their new prominence will benefit patients -- and raise some questions about the importance of tender loving care and the economic value of medical services. 
 Exhibit A in what the president of Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New York City calls "a major paradigm shift" is that hospital's decision to give its nurse practitioners admitting privileges, further blurring the line between what doctors do and what nurses can.
This shift is apparent in many areas of the medical center, from the geriatric floor where Shelly Dubin is overseeing the treatment of a group of elderly patients to the primary care clinic in which Lisa Henderson is diagnosing childhood ear infections and prescribing antibiotics. Neither likes to be called doctor, because they aren't. They have seen the future, and in it nurse practitioners can order diagnostic tests, immunize and deliver babies, perform physicals, now even admit patients to the hospital.
Like a corporation that doesn't work, medicine -- or health care, as those dedicated to reform prefer to call it -- is being forced to change because of dissatisfaction from both within and without. Physicians will still be involved in specialty treatment of serious medical conditions, as they are today, but nurses may well step into the primary care and preventive medicine breach. Some say that they've been surreptitiously providing such care for years, along with the caring some patients complain doctors lack.
One issue surrounding an expanded role for nurses is whether it will save money or become an opportunity for long-overdue salary increases. Since studies show that nurses spend more time with patients, savings may be eroded by fewer patient visits per day -- or realized at the cost of the humane treatment some find such a signal part of nursing. And since nurses are one of the largest groups of female professionals in the nation, using them to cut costs raises troubling questions about equal pay standards, particularly if they are providing services once provided by doctors.
"I won't frame this as an economic argument," said Martha Orr, executive director of the New York State Nurses Association. "Nurses have long been under-recognized and under-appreciated, economically and otherwise, and that should change. But quality of service is where we should put the emphasis. And we can provide all kinds of care in a more humane and a cost-effective way."
Dr. William T. Speck, the president of Columbia-Presbyterian, says that in his hospital, which is both a prominent teaching and research center and the health care nucleus of a sprawling urban area, giving nurse practitioners more authority simply made good sense.
For years doctors and nurses played a hierarchical game in which nurses could only suggest treatment that only a doctor could give. ("Doctor, it appears that the patient is dead" is one of the bitter little examples nurses use to illustrate this dance of deference.) But more recently nurse practitioners have been providing a range of medical services, both in rural areas and in inner-city hospitals, like Columbia-Presbyterian, where there simply were not enough primary care providers -- or enough interest in poor patients -- to go around.
"It was always clear that the nurses knew as much about some things as the doctors, and more about others," said Dr. Susan Spear, the medical director of community health services for Columbia-Presbyterian. "But they were artificially prevented from doing all they could for patients."
That simply won't do anymore. While the use of nurses and nurse practitioners in growing areas of patient care will require some adjustment for patients and doctors and some thoughtful resolution of salary issues, it is clearly the future of health care in a system that must be reconfigured around needs, not job titles. To watch the nurse practitioners at Columbia-Presbyterian go about their appointed rounds is to see the necessary being done competently by the qualified. And if some patients call them doctor -- well, they'll learn to say nurse soon enough.

HEADLINE: Fed Did Right in Raising Interest Rates

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "The Fed's Latest Mistake" by Sam Nakagama (Op-Ed, May 19): 
 We must hope Mr. Nakagama is wrong in his belief that the Federal Reserve Board erred in raising short-term interest rates half a percentage point May 17. I believe he is.
Granted that the economy is not growing as fast as some estimates of its performance would have us believe, but it is expanding at a pretty high rate. Judged by the coincident indicators, which are more sensitive and timely than the gross domestic product figures, it looks to be growing at around 3.5 percent a year, even a bit faster.
That is, of course, a catch-up rate, and needs, one way or another, to be moderated to a speed that can be continued for an extended period without exceeding the practical limits of capacity and becoming seriously inflationary.
It is pretty obvious that the Fed was trying to slow growth to a sustainable pace, without counterproductive increases in borrowing costs, perhaps even without having the mythical "wealth effect" of which Mr. Nakagama speaks. And the Fed may well have done it. Is it not interesting and relevant in this connection that, after what the Fed did, long-term borrowing costs dropped and the stock market went up?
Mr. Nakagama also refers to the 1950's, and in this case, too, sees the Fed as having made bad mistakes. Agreed, there were mistakes in the 50's, but they were the opposite, as I saw them then and still see them, of what Mr. Nakagama sees. In my view, what the Fed did on May 17 was designed to avoid precisely the mistakes that it made in the mid-50's. Because it failed to act firmly enough in 1955-56, it had to act more severely in 1957, and in doing so tripped off the 1957-58 downturn.
Having taken over as chairman of the Eisenhower Administration Council of Economic Advisers in December 1956, I felt particularly victimized by the severe tightening of credit that occurred in mid-1957. And Bill Martin, who was chairman of the Fed at the time, later stated in testimony before Congress that he thought the downturn might have been avoided if policy had been firmer in 1955-56.
Another way to look at the May 17 events is to consider what the Fed's other options were -- it could do nothing or it could ease monetary and credit conditions. It is hard for me to believe that the consequences of taking either of these other directions of policy would have been anything but seriously damaging.
Finally, it is interesting in judging the wisdom of what the Fed did, though not conclusive, that the President and all his people were happy with what happened. They had reason to be.

HEADLINE: Shelby C. Davis, Envoy and Philanthropist, 85

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
Shelby Cullom Davis, a New York investment banker, philanthropist and former United States Ambassador to Switzerland, died on Thursday at his house in Hobe Sound, Fla. He was 85 and lived in Tarrytown, N.Y.
He suffered a brief illness, his family said. 
 At his death he was the head of Shelby Cullom Davis & Company, a firm specializing in insurance securities that he founded in 1947 with $100,000. Last year it reported $848 million in capital. He was also chairman and treasurer of a foundation bearing his name, whose disbursements go chiefly to higher education and to research on public policy and economics.
In 1964 he presented a check for $5.3 million to Princeton University, his alma mater, to support its history department. He endowed Princeton's Center for Historic Studies, several chairs of history there, chairs at Wellesley College, and professorships of free enterprise at Wellesley and at the Cullom-Davis Library at Bradley University in honor of his parents. Other beneficiaries included the Library and Museum of the Performing Arts at Lincoln Center.
He served as the American envoy in Bern under Presidents Richard M. Nixon and Gerald R. Ford from 1969 to 1975. He was a past chairman of the Heritage Foundation, a former governor of the Society of Mayflower Descendants and president of the Sons of the Revolution.
Mr. Davis was born in Peoria, Ill. He graduated from Princeton in 1930 and earned a master's degree at Columbia University in 1931 and a doctorate in political science at the University of Geneva in 1934. He worked as a European correspondent for the Columbia Broadcasting System in Geneva and as an economist before joining the staff of Thomas E. Dewey.
He advised on economics when Mr. Dewey ran for president as the Republican candidate in 1940 and again in 1944. With Mr. Dewey as Governor of New York, he served as First Deputy Superintendent of Insurance from 1944 to 1947.
He became a member of the New York Stock Exchange in 1941 and for many years was the managing partner of the firm bearing his name. He was its chairman at the time of his death.
Mr. Davis is survived by his wife of 62 years, Kathryn Wasserman Davis; a son, Shelby M. C., of Manhattan; a daughter, Diana D. Spencer of Wellesley, Mass., and eight grandchildren.

HEADLINE: North Korea's Dangerous Lurch

 BODY:
Enough is enough. North Korea has responded to the United States' patient and hopeful diplomacy with recalcitrance and provocative nuclear maneuvering. The recalcitrance was tolerable when talks were inching toward progress. But now the North is rushing to unload spent fuel from its nuclear reactor while delaying talks. If that is a negotiating tactic, it is one that the North Koreans must abandon immediately as deal-breaking brinkmanship.
The U.S. has been right to hold out for a negotiated nuclear-free Korean Peninsula. But North Korea seems intent on demonstrating that patient diplomacy will elicit only duplicity and defiance. It if intends to send some other message, it must do so quickly or else it may leave the U.S. no recourse but to seek economic sanctions and prepare for any military reactions. 
 The U.S., in an effort to woo North Korea away from building nuclear bombs, has been offering to resume high-level talks promptly. But last week the North spurned immediate talks and rushed instead to remove spent fuel rods from its nuclear reactor at Yongbyon at a rate far faster than anticipated.
That could very shortly make it impossible for inspectors to take or segregate the 300 samples they seek from the full complement of 8,000 fuel rods. Those samples would allow inspectors to determine how much spent fuel North Korea has diverted in the past and whether that was enough to build two nuclear bombs, as some intelligence suggests. Without samples to provide a clear accounting of the North's nuclear past, diplomacy to assure a nuclear-free Korea may falter and the world may turn in frustration to economic sanctions that Pyongyang itself warns could lead to war.
North Korea's rush to remove the spent fuel rods from the reactor raises two concerns. One is that by unloading the fuel rods without segregating some for future assay, it could be trying to keep inspectors from learning about its nuclear past. That past includes a 100-day period in 1989 when the reactor was shut down and some spent fuel was diverted -- two bombs' worth by one worst-case estimate. The assays would help the inspectors determine how long and at what power the reactor was operating and thus how much spent fuel it should have produced. The assays could also help determine whether any of the original fuel rods were replaced; the plutonium extracted from them could end up in bombs.
A second, even greater, concern is that the spent fuel now being removed will itself be diverted to bomb-making, giving North Korea enough material from this batch of fuel to make perhaps four or five bombs. At the moment inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency see no sign of that. But as long as the spent fuel remains at Yongbyon, inspectors will need access to assure that no diversion occurs. So far the North has permitted that access.
North Korea has long sought a resumption of high-level bilateral talks with the United States in an effort to gain diplomatic recognition and increased trade and investment. But Washington has set two critical conditions for holding the talks. The North has thus far satisfied one condition by allowing inspectors and cameras to monitor the current removal of fuel rods to prevent diversion to weapons programs and allowing them to complete work it interrupted in March -- work that would verify that it has not diverted any spent fuel or reprocessed plutonium in the past year.
But North Korea is dangerously close to making it impossible to meet the second condition -- that nothing be done to preclude analyses that could determine whether fuel was diverted earlier, particularly in the suspect 1989 period. Indeed, when Washington tried to schedule the high-level talks for this week, the North proposed a later date and accelerated removal of the fuel rods without setting any aside for later sampling.
Time is running out for the kind of diplomacy the U.S. has pursued. If the North stays on its present course, by week's end the world will face an unpalatable choice: Live with the possibility that North Korea may have diverted two bombs' worth of plutonium in the past, or move to sanctions. Pyongyang should recognize that the Clinton Administration and its South Korean allies will be under enormous pressure to impose sanctions, even if that leads the North to bar inspectors and make more bombs.
This time, in playing brinkmanship North Korea has gone too far. If it wants to avoid deepening its isolation, it has a way out: Stop removing nuclear fuel and resume talks.

CORRECTION-DATE: June 2, 1994, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, a diagram yesterday explaining the extraction of plutonium from nuclear fuel rods referred incorrectly in some editions to the country suspected of diverting plutonium from its nuclear power program to make weapons. It is North Korea, not South Korea.

HEADLINE: U.N. Lists Four Nations at Risk Because of Wide Income Gaps

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, June 1

 BODY:
Egypt, South Africa, Nigeria and Brazil are among countries now in danger of joining the world's list of failed states because of wide income gaps between sections of their populations, a new United Nations report warns. Disastrous social upheavals and explosions could result, it says.
The warning comes in the United Nations Development Program's annual Human Development Report, a widely respected work that seeks to measure the development progress each country is making, not in terms of increasing its overall wealth but in how it uses that wealth to improve the longevity and literacy of its people and reduce poverty. The report does this by compiling a Human Development Index that compares different regions and ethnic groups. 
 "The Human Development Index holds a mirror up to society, forcing policy makers to take note of disturbing disparities between various regions, various ethnic groups and various income classes," said Mahbub ul Haq, a Pakistani economist and former Minister of Finance and Planning, who prepares the report. "Timely action can forestall a gathering storm."
The report traditionally reflects the present interest among development specialists in improving the lives of individuals so they have more options rather than building up a country's aggregate wealth through huge industrial investments.
This means channeling resources to the people who most need them, especially women and the poor. It also implies a degree of democracy to prevent development aid and investment from being concentrated in politically powerful areas.
But an attempt several years ago to include an index of human freedom in the report was suppressed by developing countries who feared they would lose aid if their ranking in that index was low. The writers of the report are now reintroducing a somewhat similar concept, however, by saying countries that do not distribute wealth fairly may fail.
 
Lowest Quality of Life
 Among developing countries, the development index puts Barbados, Hong Kong and Cyprus at the top in promoting life expectancy, education and income, and Guinea, Burkina Faso and Afghanistan at the bottom.
Among developed nations, Canada, Switzerland and Japan are at the top, with the United States in eighth place. Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan have the lowest quality of life.
On Egypt, the report notes "disturbing contrasts" between rural Upper Egypt and Cairo province. While Cairo, measured as a separate state, would rank 69th in the world for human development, or just behind Turkey, Upper Egypt would stand in 125th place, below Cameroon. Upper Egypt has less than half the literacy rate of Cairo, while the average life expectancy is six years lower and incomes are 45 percent lower.
Despite the advent of democracy in South Africa, the report says the white and black sections of the population are not just two different peoples but "almost two different worlds." If white South Africa were a separate country it would rank 24th in the world in terms of human development while black South Africa would be in 123d place, just above Congo.
"The major challenge for policy makers will be to provoke social integration without provoking racial violence," the report says.
Disparities among Nigeria's 19 states are described as "amongst the worst in the world." The index puts the state of Bendel ahead of a progressive country like Sri Lanka while the state of Borno ranks lower than any country in the world, with an average life expectancy of 40 years and only 12 percent of its adult population literate.
In Brazil, the report highlights the discrepancy in living standards between the more prosperous south and the impoverished northeast, where life expectancy is 17 years shorter, adult literacy 33 percent lower and average incomes 40 percent lower.

HEADLINE: Manufacturing in May Posted 9th Straight Gain

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Manufacturing activity grew in May as production increased for the ninth consecutive month, the National Association of Purchasing Management said yesterday.
The association said that of the 20 industries in the manufacturing sector, 18 reported stronger business than in April, the largest number to report gains since March 1990. 
 "Generally, the tone of the economic numbers is quite solid," said David Jones, an economist with Aubrey G. Lanston & Company. "It's the kind of strength that leads to more orders, more employment, more production and more growth."
The purchasing managers' group said its overall index held at 57.7 percent in May, the same as in April. A reading above 50 percent indicates manufacturing is generally expanding; one below 50 indicates a decline.
The association's employment index surged to 52 last month, from 50.8 in April -- the second consecutive gain and the highest level since December 1988.
 
Prices Rise on Broad Front
 The association, based in Tempe, Ariz., said the robust activity had caused prices to rise across the board for manufacturers, intensifying fears of inflation and initially causing bond yields to rise and stocks to fall. The markets, however, ended with gains.
Economists said prices were rising for the commodities that manufacturers use to make their goods, rather than for consumer goods.
"I think the inflation story is a future story," Mr. Jones said. "We're not getting as much on the inflation side as we normally would in this stage of a rebound."
The group's report is scrutinized because manufacturing accounts for about one-fifth of the economy and the report provides the first reading of how the economy performed in the previous month. The first Government look will come tomorrow in the May unemployment report.
While the recovery has been picking up, the impact of four interest rate increases from the Federal Reserve this year is starting to be felt. Lending and mortgage rates have increased, slowing construction and home buying. Construction spending, which is especially sensitive to interest-rate changes, eased in April to one-third of the pace in March, the Commerce Department reported.
The department said new construction projects rose at an annual rate of six-tenths of 1 percent in April following a revised 1.9 percent increase in March. It said that spending on privately financed construction projects -- homes, apartment buildings, offices and hotels -- rose 1.7 percent in the month, compared with a rise of 2.9 percent in March.
Public construction, like highways and public housing, fell by a surprising 2.5 percent in April following a decline of 1 percent in March.
"There's still quite a bit of momentum in the economy," said David Wyss of DRI/McGraw-Hill Inc., an economic research company in Lexington, Mass., "but higher interest rates are beginning to take a toll and by the second half we will see some slowing."

HEADLINE: Jamaica to Let U.S. Anchor Ship Off Coast

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 1

 BODY:
Jamaica agreed today to let the United States anchor ships in its waters so American officials can hold shipboard hearings to determine whether fleeing Haitians qualify for refugee status.
The Jamaican decision represents a diplomatic victory for the Clinton Administration, which promised last month to provide individual hearings for Haitian boat people rather than forcibly send them back without hearings. Later, the Administration realized it did not have a suitable place to conduct such hearings. 
 The Clinton Administration has been eager to find processing centers in third countries because fleeing Haitians who are processed in the United States often remain for years even if their asylum applications are rejected because Federal courts can permit them to stay until their appeals are exhausted.
The Administration has been under pressure to set up the shipboard processing as soon as possible because it has been in the embarrassing position of continuing to summarily repatriate Haitians without interviews even though President Clinton announced on May 8 that he was abandoning this policy.
[The United States Coast Guard returned 63 fleeing Haitians to Port-au-Prince Wednesday, the third group repatriated in a week, Reuters reported. That brought to 1,439 the number of refugees brought back to their homeland since Washington said it would halt the practice.]
 
Ship Heads for Kingston
 After the United States and Jamaica announced their agreement, Administration officials said they hoped to have a large American ship anchored in Kingston harbor within several days to begin interviewing Haitian emigrants.
"They'd like to start this at the beginning of next week," said Barbara Francis, the United States spokeswoman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, which is working with the Clinton Administration on setting up the processing.
The plan is for a 1,000-bed Navy hospital ship to arrive in Jamaica this week so it can begin processing what American officials expect to be a steady stream of fleeing Haitians. In light of a recent United Nations decision to tighten the trade embargo against Haiti, Administration officials fear an accelerating exodus.
About 300 Americans will work on the hospital ship, including Immigration and Naturalization Service officials who will conduct hearings and Navy personnel who run the ship.
In addition, about 10 employees of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees will work on the ship to provide training for the American hearing officers and will counsel the Haitian applicants.
 
U.S. to Cover All Costs
 Christine Shelly, a State Department spokeswoman, said the United States will cover all costs connected to the shipboard processing.
Jamaica has not asked Washington for any payment for allowing American ships to anchor in its waters, but Jamaican officials have conveyed their displeasure that the Clinton Administration has not appointed an Ambassador to Jamaica and is cutting economic aid to the island.
Under the Administration's plan, Coast Guard cutters will pick up Haitian boat people in the Caribbean and take them to Kingston Harbor. Haitians who are found to have a well-founded fear of persecution in their homeland will be transported to the United States, or perhaps another country. Those whose claim of persecution is declared to be not well-founded will be taken back to Haiti.
"We would hope they would go not only to the U.S., but that other countries would step forward to accept some of them," an Administration official said concerning those granted asylum.
 
Hope for Turks and Caicos
 United States officials say they still hope that the Turks and Caicos Islands, a British-ruled group of small islands off the Bahamas, will agree to allow Washington to set up processing centers there.
The legislative council of those islands is scheduled to meet on Friday to consider Washington's request.
Turks and Caicos officials have offered the United States an uninhabited island, but Washington is concerned about the lack of docking facilities and potable water on the island.
The United States sent a second ship to Jamaica today. That ship, a leased, 700-bed Ukrainian cruise ship, will be anchored in Kingston to handle the spillover from the Navy hospital ship, or it will be anchored off the Turks and Caicos Islands, officials said.

Haitian Files Suit
 A Haitian refugee who was chopped with a machete and left for dead in her homeland filed a $30 million lawsuit in Brooklyn yesterday against a far-right political group in Haiti.
The refugee, Alerte Belance, who now lives in Newark, N.J., sued the Haitian Front of Advancement and Progress in Federal Court for an attack last fall that cost her a right arm and left her with deep gashes on her neck and across her face.
Her suit is based on a ruling that allows some victims of human rights abuses committed abroad to seek redress in an American court.

HEADLINE: U.S. Stocks End Steady Amid Inflation Anxiety

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
Stocks dropped sharply in Europe overnight and on Wall Street in the morning yesterday, but United States stocks recovered strongly by the closing gavel as an unusual and confusing confluence of inflation anxieties swept through American, European and Japanese stock and bond markets.
What is unquestionably clear is that international stock traders are becoming increasingly worried. Like their counterparts in America, they seem to growing more concerned about inflation because of the convergence of an ebullient American economy, a surprisingly resurgent Europe and a recession-racked Japan that seems to be showing unexpected strength. 
 The Financial Times 100 index in London dropped 1.3 percent, and the French CAC-40 index fell 2.47 percent; the German DAX index rose slightly, up .09 percent.
Even Japan, locked in a three-year recession, saw bond yields soar, but without setting records, after better-than-expected industrial production figures surprised analysts. The Nikkei index of 225 issues rose slightly, up 0.38 percent.
 
 
Deadlock for the Dow
 In the end, however, deadlock was the word, at least for now. The major American stock indexes barely moved. After falling more than 26 points shortly after 10 A.M., the Dow Jones industrial average zigzagged the rest of the day before recovering to 3,760.83, up 2.46 points.
The other indexes wandered, too, before ending barely higher. After falling more than 2.50 points, the broader Standard & Poor's 500 rose 1.12 points, to 457.63. The Nasdaq composite index fell as much as 4.50 points before recovering to 735.52, up 0.33 point.
Blue chips like International Paper and Chevron rose on no immediate news. Semiconductor companies like Intel and big banks like Citicorp also rose on no immediate news. But U S Surgical gained 2 3/4, to 21 3/4, on takeover speculation, and IDB Communications fell 7 3/8, 7 1/8, over a dispute with its auditors. IDB Communications was the most active stock yesterday as 32.5 million of its shares changed hands.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was near normal at 278.5 million shares, about 7 percent below this year's average of 300 million shares. The near-normal day followed six consecutive sessions of below-average trading volume.
 
 
'It Just Got Worse'
 As in recent months, a falling bond market has been driving down the stock market. "We walked in this morning and found most of the European bond markets down and then it just got worse," said Chris Madell, head of Government bond trading at First Chicago Capital Markets.
In the end, bonds recovered, too. The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell to 7.39 percent from 7.43 percent the day before.
For the American side of the markets, the immediate downdraft for stocks and bonds came from a closely watched index that implied that United States factory activity, and possibly inflation, was still growing.
The National Association of Purchasing Management index was unchanged in May but showed the economy expanding for the ninth straight month, despite recent economic data that suggested the possibility of a slowdown.
But at the same time traders noticed that the daily Commodity Research Bureau index was falling convincingly throughout the day on weakness in futures contracts for silver, coffee, lumber and live cattle. The index had been sparking inflation concerns recently as it rose in response to fears about a possible drought involving soybeans and other agricultural products.
As American traders struggled with these conflicting reports, European and Japanese bond markets were trading sharply down on inflation concerns. Germany, Europe's largest economy, appeared to be rising out of recession faster than analysts expected, with industrial production up 4.1 percent from a year earlier.
But a rare public disagreement by members of the policy council of the Bundesbank confused traders about the central bank's inflation-fighting strategy. German bond yields soared to a 17-month high.
 
 
German Money Supply
 "The story I heard was that there was also increasing concern about German money-supply growth, which has been pretty high," Fred Leiner, fixed-income market strategist at Continental Bank, said. That would mean that the Bundesbank would hesitate to cut German interest rates further, maintaining downward pressure on United States bonds and the dollar.

HEADLINE: Cape Town Journal;
In Land of Smokers, Mandela Heads Resistance

BYLINE: By BILL KELLER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG, June 1

 BODY:
South Africans smoke in crowded elevators. They smoke on television. There are nursery schools where teachers smoke in the classroom.
Iraj Aedian, an anti-smoking economist at the University of Cape Town, recently walked into the maternity ward of a private hospital and was horrified to find a crowd of visitors puffing happily among the newborn. 
 But as of last week there is one place they do not smoke. In the Cabinet room of President Nelson Mandela's Government, the ashtrays have been banished, and even the chain-smoking former President, now Vice President, F. W. de Klerk, is obliged to step outside to assuage his craving.
The Cabinet room is the first beachhead in what Dr. Nkosazana Zuma, Mr. Mandela's new Minister of Health, promises will be a concerted battle for the hearts and lungs of the nation.
Dr. Zuma's assault on the smoking habit is not the highest priority of the new post-apartheid Government, or even of her own ministry -- the promise of free health care for poor children is her first job -- but it reflects a readiness in the new Government to take on powerful interests in areas not confined to the social ravages of apartheid.
In an interview, Dr. Zuma, a 45-year-old physician, said she would push for the conversion of smoke-congested workplaces and public buildings to smoke-free zones, a ban on the tobacco advertising and a steep increase in the cigarette excise tax.
Last week she issued regulations requiring health warnings in cigarette advertisements.
Her crusade will pit her against the well-connected domestic cigarette industry, a prospect Dr. Zuma anticipates with the unruffled determination of a woman new to Government but accustomed to political resistance. By gentle persistence, she helped persuade the reluctant, male-dominated hierarchy of the African National Congress to advocate the legalization of abortion, when many leaders were afraid of arousing the election-time hostility of conservative Christians and tribal chiefs.
As an AIDS researcher, she has promoted sex education and condom distribution in rural areas where these were considered radical innovations.
Dr. Zuma said that overturning the country's strict abortion laws and promoting awareness of AIDS would also be among her goals as Health Minister, assuring that she will not want for exercise of her political muscles.
At first glance her alarm about smoking might seem exaggerated. About 30 percent of adults over age 16 smoke, similar to England and the United States. But the overall number is low because few black women -- 5 to 7 percent -- smoke, and that is changing, encouraged by cigarette advertisements that increasingly aim at black women.
The pattern in countries like South Africa is that as rural dwellers move to the city, as traditional taboos break down and income levels rise, men smoke more and women join the smoking fraternity.
Among the mixed-race South Africans known as "coloreds," who are a bit more affluent and urban than blacks, 55 percent of men and 36 percent of women now smoke. They also have one of the highest rates of death from lung cancer of any community in the world.
"Our colored community unfortunately represents the future unless legislative action is taken now," said Yussuf Saloojee, director of the National Council Against Smoking.
Except among health-conscious whites, smoking has been steadily growing, abetted by a culture that has long treated tobacco as a harmless and stylish vice.
Until February, the law placed no age limit on the buying of cigarettes.
Two years ago smoking was banned on domestic airline flights, but smoke-free zones are still regarded as a novelty in public buildings.
At about 75 cents a pack, cigarettes are cheap, and according to Mr. Saloojee, the taxes are lower than any place except a few of the tobacco-growing states in America.
Although state television has stopped cigarette advertising, commercials on radio and in movie theaters portray smoking as a glamorous, cosmopolitan and -- the ultimate cachet -- American thing to do.
Articles about the dangers of smoking are rare in the South African press, which is heavily dependent on cigarette advertising revenues.
"The extent of awareness is abysmal," said Mr. Aedian, the economist. "In Canada and the United States, it's taken a great deal of continuous education to convince people that smoking is bad. That doesn't exist here. We just cannot afford spending that much on public education."
The South African tobacco industry has parried past attacks by pointing to the largely black work force -- 50,000, according to the Tobacco Exchange, an industry group -- employed in harvesting on the tobacco plantations and in the assembly lines of cigarette factories.
The cigarette industry here is dominated by the influential Rembrandt Group, a conglomerate that controls gold mines, banks and insurance companies. Together with large tobacco growers and allies in the powerful farm lobby, the cigarette makers have cultivated a smoker-friendly Government.
"The tobacco companies lobbied my colleagues just as hard as they could," said Rina Venter, Dr. Zuma's predecessor as Health Minister. "They came forward with very expensive documents, well prepared to prove that cigarette smoking is not harmful to your health."
With support from Mr. de Klerk, Mrs. Venter won the first modest restrictions last year, including a 16-year age limit on cigarette purchases and a provision allowing local officials to declare no-smoking areas in public buildings. But she said more far-reaching proposals stood no chance at the time.
Dr. Zuma starts out with the advantage of an African National Congress policy that is strongly anti-smoking, and with the sympathy of the new President.
President Mandela, an anti-smoking lobbyist said approvingly, "does not allow anyone to come within 20 feet of him with a cigarette."

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Precious-Metal Prices Drop As Commodity Index Falls

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Precious metals fell yesterday as a decline in the Commodity Research Bureau's index suggested that prices for basic commodities might not be a source of renewed inflation.
The C.R.B. index of 21 commodity prices, a widely watched gauge of inflation, fell 1.61, to 233.84, ending a two-day rally that on Tuesday brought the index to its second-highest close since October 1990. Declines in copper, lumber and livestock helped push the index lower. 
 The drop in commodities pushed gold, silver and platinum lower and allowed bond prices, another sensitive gauge of inflation, to rise for the first time in five trading sessions.
"These are short-term fears" caused by a recent rise in soybean prices, said Daniel Weissman, head precious metals trader with MTB Bank in New York. "If inflation were in the air, gold should trade much higher. The market is saying none of this means anything.
 
Gold Contract Down
 Gold for August delivery, the most active futures contract, fell as low as $383.50 an ounce, closing $3.70 lower at $386.30 an ounce on the Commodity Exchange in New York. July silver fell 20 cents, its largest drop in almost two months, to $5.35 an ounce. July platinum fell $3.80, to $400.40 an ounce on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Meanwhile, July copper fell 2.75 cent, to $1.010 a pound on the Comex.
While the C.R.B. index is respected, other indexes, like the Goldman Sachs Commodity Index, offer a more accurate view of whether changes in commodity prices will bring inflation to the economy, many analysts say.
The C.R.B. index gives equal weight to all components, from platinum to orange juice. The Goldman Sachs index weighs each for their relative effect on consumer prices. Energy prices account for 14 percent of the C.R.B. index. They are 48 percent of the Goldman index. Late yesterday, the Goldman Sachs index was unchanged at 2268.91.
 
Cattle Prices Fall the Limit
 On other commodity markets, cattle prices fell their daily trading limit before recovering on concern about weak demand from retailers.
June live cattle for August delivery fell 1.50 cent, to 63.775 cents a pound on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. August feeder cattle also fell its limit, dropping 1.50 cent, to 72.45 cents a pound.
Traders are concerned that retailers bought much of the beef to restock shelves following Memorial Day and will not order much more for Father's Day.
Elsewhere, lumber prices fell from a two-month high amid concerns whether rising interest rates would dampen housing demand. July lumber fell $10, the daily trading limit, to $387.70 for $1,000 board feet on the Merc. On Tuesday, lumber rose to its highest price since late March.

HEADLINE: Rich Saudi Bails Out Disney Unit

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, June 1

 BODY:
A Saudi prince who provided cash to Citicorp at a crucial time in its restructuring has agreed to acquire a major stake in Euro Disneyland, the struggling French theme park, and to provide $100 million to build a convention center considered crucial to the park's survival, the parent Walt Disney Company said today.
Under the agreement, Prince Walid bin Talal, a nephew of King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, will acquire 13 percent to 24 percent ownership in Euro Disney, through a stock rights offering. 
 The offering will increase the number of shares in Euro Disney to 770 million from 170 million now. With it, the Prince's investment in the company is expected to total between $400 million and $500 million.
 
Deal With Park's Creditors
 The rights offering is part of a financial restructuring between Euro Disney and its creditors that is expected to put the theme park, critically short of cash, back on its feet. Walt Disney, based in Burbank, Calif., will subscribe to 49 percent of the new rights, in proportion to its current stake in Euro Disney, and the public will be offered 51 percent.
United Saudi Commercial Bank, of which Prince Walid is chairman, has agreed to act as a backup underwriter with the three banks leading the syndicate group that is underwriting the 51 percent to be sold to the public. The offering is expected to be completed by July.
The Prince, who is 37, gained international prominence early in 1991, when he became the largest shareholder in Citicorp, investing nearly $800 million when the New York bank holding company's shares were depressed by problems from bad real estate loans. He later sold large numbers of those shares for nearly two and a half times what he paid.
 
Two Sources of Equity
 Under the new agreement, Prince Walid can buy shares both from the Walt Disney Company and the syndicate group. He can buy up to 1.9 billion francs -- $338 million -- worth of shares that are not acquired by the syndicate group. If that quantity of shares is not available to him, the Walt Disney Company will sell him Euro Disney shares worth up to one billion francs -- $177.8 million -- at the issue price. The Prince has agreed to limit his total investment in Euro Disney to half of the Walt Disney Company's shareholdings.
His investment is a major vote of confidence for the Euro Disney venture, which has been losing money since it opened in April 1992. Hurt by the European recession, bad weather, cultural differences and high start-up costs, the park has failed to attract European visitors in numbers as great as it had expected.
Euro Disney has announced an operating loss of $183.9 million for the first half of the 1994 fiscal year, with revenue declining 12.4 percent, to $276 million.
The Walt Disney Company's chairman, Michael D. Eisner, said in a statement today: "This significant investment and financing commitment by Prince al-Walid means that there is a strong, sophisticated new partner who shares our view of Euro Disney's future and whose involvement enhances Disney's major contribution to the Euro Disney financial restructuring package."
The restructuring plan includes debt payment forgiveness and deferral of principal payments that will provide breathing room to Euro Disney to continue operations. The parent company is also making concessions, including waiving royalty and management fees for five years and reducing the amount in succeeding years.
 
Decision Is Hailed
 Industry analysts applauded the Prince's investment, saying that it would be good for all involved, especially the Walt Disney Company, which has been widely criticized for mishandling the European venture.
"It's good for Disney in the sense that it lessens Disney's equity ownership in Euro Disney, which in turn will be beneficial to the company's earnings, reducing the amount it will absorb from Euro Disney's losses," said Richard P. Simon of Goldman, Sachs.
The Prince also agreed to a three-year financial commitment of $100 million to build a convention center near the park, which is situated 20 miles east of Paris. The convention center is seen as vital to drawing new visitors to the park and hotels during the midweek and off-season periods.
Prince Walid heads a multibillion-dollar business empire that includes banking, travel, real estate, broadcasting and supermarkets.
The Prince could not be reached for comment today. A receptionist at the office of Faissal M. Fahad, his Prince's lawyer in San Francisco, said that Mr. Fahad was traveling in Saudi Arabia and that no one would be available to comment on the Euro Disney investment.
But in a statement released by the Walt Disney Company, Prince Walid said: "I believe the long-term prospects for Euro Disney are bright. The quality of what has been constructed at Euro Disneyland Paris makes me optimistic about its future. Becoming a partner in the Euro Disney project is consistent with my strategy to invest significant amounts of capital in association with superior management teams around the world."

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
New Fund Raises $1 Billion For Investment Plan in Asia

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT 

 BODY:
While Asian stock markets have been plummeting and tepid investor demand led the Tiger Management Corporation to cancel plans for an investment fund in emerging economies, the American International Group has raised more than $1 billion for a fund to invest in large infrastructure projects in Asia.
With an illustrious history that began in Shanghai in 1919, American International is seen by corporate America as something of a "China hand," and is the most internationally minded of American insurance companies. Its links to China and other Asian countries are more than just historical. American International is a well-established insurer in many Asian markets, including China, where other companies are struggling to enter. 
 The new fund, called the A.I.G. Asian Infrastructure Fund, will make large, long-term investments in projects for developing energy, transportation, electric power and petrochemicals. It will be managed by two former executives from the World Bank: Moeen A. Qureshi, formerly the bank's second ranking officer who also served as interim Prime Minister of Pakistan last year, and Donald C. Roth, the bank's former treasurer. Mr. Qureshi left the World Bank in 1991 and Mr. Roth in 1992. They became founders in 1992 of the Emerging Markets Corporation, an investment fund.
The familiarity of Mr. Qureshi and Mr. Roth with many government officials, local businesses and other financiers, whose cooperation is essential for long-term infrastructure projects, helped the fund attract twice the $500 million target it set when fund-raising started in late 1993. By late May, when the fund was closed to new investors, it had nearly two dozen institutional investors and $1.08 billion.
Officials at American International and the new fund were unavailable to comment, but people familiar with the fund said its investors included various agencies of the Singapore Government with $250 million, as well as American International itself with $100 million.
Although the growth potential of emerging countries in Asia is attractive to outside investors, many of them have a hard time finding outlets for their funds because local stocks are often thinly traded and cannot readily absorb large blocks of capital. In addition, there is the risk of highly volatile markets, as shown by the steep market declines this year of 20 percent in Hong Kong, 23 percent in Malaysia, 19 percent in Thailand and 16 percent in Indonesia.
 
 
'Not Yet Developed Enough'
 "In these markets it is hard to find enough publicly trade stocks to invest large amounts of money," John A. Griffin, president of Tiger Management, said last year when he announced plans for Tiger's emerging markets fund. "You could readily invest $100 million in a power plant or container port in China, but to buy $100 million of stock is impossible. Their capital markets are not yet developed enough."
Despite the appeal of investing in large projects, not all funds embracing that idea have been able to attract money from investors. Tiger Management canceled plans for a $1 billion fund to invest in Asia and other markets when it was unable to raise more than $250 million. Other investment funds similar to that of A.I.G. include the Asian Infrastructure Fund, sponsored by Peregrine Investment Holdings, Hong Kong, whose clients include Soros Fund Management and some American pension funds.
Mr. Qureshi started at the World Bank as a loan officer. In his 30 years at the bank, he worked in many different jobs before leaving in 1991 as a senior vice president and No. 2 ranking officer. When he was named interim Prime Minister of Pakistan, Mr. Qureshi earned high marks for economic reforms that elected Government officials had been unable to achieve, such as taxing large rural landowners and curbing Government spending.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasuries Revive After Early Losses

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Interest rates dropped yesterday for the first time in five days as commodity prices declined, easing traders' concern about inflation.
Treasury bond prices rebounded from early losses. Many traders sold Treasury securities yesterday morning after the National Association of Purchasing Management reported that its manufacturing index showed unexpected strength in May. 
 But as commodity prices headed lower, investors and traders bought back Treasury securities that they had sold short earlier, betting that they could buy them back at a lower price.
"The market got short early, and then commodity prices were lower," said Michael McGlone, manager of over-the-counter bond options trading at Aubrey G. Lanston & Company. "That started the short-covering, and then it just accelerated."
 
Yield Drops to 7.39%
 The Treasury's 30-year bond gained 13/32 of a point, while its yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, ended the day at 7.39 percent, down from 7.43 percent on Tuesday.
Earlier, the 30-year bond had been down as much as 27/32 , while its yield rose as high as 7.51 percent. The purchasing managers' report prompted concerns among traders that the Federal Reserve was likely to push up interest rates to contain the possible inflation that faster economic growth might bring.
So far this year, evidence of inflation is scarce. Consumer prices rose 2.4 percent in the 12 months ended in April, down from 2.7 percent last year. Medical care costs in the year ended April rose 5.3 percent, compared with 6.7 percent in the same period last year and 7.8 percent in 1992.
Even so, the purchasing managers' report will "make people realize there's a possibility of the Fed tightening at their next meeting," said James Hale, senior fixed-income strategist at MMS International in San Francisco. Since Feb. 4, the Fed has raised overnight bank loan rates four times, to 4.25 percent from 3 percent, in an attempt to head off inflation.
The next major piece of evidence on the economy and inflation will arrive tomorrow, when the Labor Department reports on May employment. Bonds are expected to be little changed before the report.
Businesses hired 289,000 more workers last month, according to a Bloomberg Business News survey of economists. In April, the economy added 267,000 jobs as the unemployment rate declined to 6.4 percent from 6.5in March.
"Friday's numbers will set the tone for the market for the next couple of weeks," said Marcello Frustaci, a trader at Daiwa Securities.
 
Mortgage Securities Helped
 The late surge in Treasury prices helped to lift mortgage securities by a quarter point and municipal bonds as much as 1/2 point.
In the corporate market, the Signet Banking Corporation sold about $1 billion of floating-rate debt backed by credit card receivables at a time when rising interest rates have pushed up demand for floating-rate issues.
Unlike many credit card issues, Signet's floating-rate debt has no limit on the amount of interest it pays. Some money managers and analysts say the lack of a limit is attractive to investors who expect higher rates.
Meanwhile, the corporate bond market saw a narrowing of the spread -- the difference in yield between corporate bonds and Treasury securities, a trader at UBS Securities said. A narrower yield gap indicates stronger demand for corporate debt.
On average, the yield on utility bonds narrowed by about two to three basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, while telephone bonds narrowed by about one to two basis points.
The Treasury auctioned about $14 billion in 13-day cash management bills. Following are the results of that auction:

(000 omitted in dollar figures)
 
Average price . . . 99.852
Discounted rate . . . 4.09%

HEADLINE: From Harvard, Help for Inner City

BYLINE: By ALISON LEIGH COWAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
After years of advising companies, countries and even professional sports on how to be more competitive, Michael E. Porter is turning to the outcasts of corporate America: the inner cities.
Easily one of Harvard Business School's brainiest professors, he spent a day recently scampering over mud and construction debris, dodging plates of soul food and twirling sugar cane during a tour of businesses in some of Boston's toughest neighborhoods, which have been his classroom over the last two years. 
 "What we're trying to do is facilitate a process," he said. "A lot of my students have never been in the inner-city before, and now they're finding out there are entrepreneurs here to work with. That's what is going to solve this problem. Not some magic government solution. But lots of little connections that get built. I've watched nations grow, and they grow not in grand bursts, but in the slow way people connect."
 
Making the Rounds
 One stop on the tour was a waste hauler in Roxbury. Pointing to three skyscrapers in the distance, Mr. Porter lights up, thinking about how the business could use its location, just minutes from downtown Boston, to triple its sales.
A few blocks away, in Boston's South End, he dashes into a storefront restaurant, greets the proprietor and conjures up a chain that could, with some repositioning, export its "glori-fried" chicken and sweet potato pies ("Southern food with a touch of soul," he calls it) to other locations and go public.
A quick spin in the car, and now he is darting around sugar cane, yucca chips and 100-pound sacks of rice at a Dorchester supermarket. There was a murder not long ago in what is now the parking lot. Yet this business, in his view, could someday give local grocers like Star Market a run for their money in Hispanic neighborhoods.
The trouble, as Professor Porter sees it, goes beyond prejudice to a lack of formal training, management information and financial skills. What he has in mind, a vision he laid out recently to 150 business owners and government leaders here, is rather ambitious, and depends in part on his ability to continue to tap some of the business school's assets: money, alumni, students, faculty and corporate contacts.
Professor Porter, who is 47, credits his wife, Deborah, for kindling his interest in the communities the free markets leave behind. A former marketing executive, she returned to work after the birth of their two daughters to start an organization that finds professional summer jobs for disadvantaged high school youth.
The other nudge came last year when he was advising Gov. William F. Weld on how to revitalize Massachusetts. "One massive issue where we didn't have good answers was what to do with the distressed areas of the state like Lowell and inner-city Boston," he said. "So, I set out to do some thinking about it."
 
Golfing With Clinton
 Yet some people, who know that the spry, silver-haired professor spent time on the links with President Clinton a few months back, wonder whether all of this has been concocted as a way of raising his visibility inside the Washington Beltway. They say he is simply repositioning the old Michael Porter, the registered Republican, for a job in a Democratic administration.
While he won't rule out a Washington job some day, Professor Porter says he is simply following his usual path of wanting to attack the big problems of his day. And the business owners whom he is helping seem grateful for the hours of free technical assistance and the connections. "One of the great things Mike can do is bring light to this because of the respect he has out in the business community," said Darryl Settles, the owner of Bob the Chef's, whose "glori-fried" chicken specialties brings in sales of $1 million a year.
A list of accomplishments built that respect. His 1980 book, "Competitive Strategy," sold more than half a million copies in 15 languages. Companies from AT&T to Du Pont and countries from Canada to Portugal pay upward of $2,500 an hour for his advice, $25,000 for his speeches and $1,000 for his videos. ("I'm a premium product," he says without modesty.) His advice also helped the National Football League drive the upstart United States Football League out of business.
Before this year, Mr. Porter, a native of Ann Arbor, Mich., who graduated with top honors from Princeton University and went straight to Harvard, first as a business and economics student, then as a professor, had not spent much time in Boston's forgotten neighborhoods.
 
'A Fascinating Issue'
 That changed when Kenneth H. Fearn, a black Harvard student who grew up in South Central Los Angeles, asked Mr. Porter to supervise a study on the economics of inner cities shortly after the 1992 riots. "By March last year, it became clear to me this was a fascinating issue, but that a few students doing field studies couldn't make enough of a dent," Mr. Porter said.
He expects to expand the number of business school students he can pair up with urban businesses in need of advice. Twenty-five Harvard students, almost half of whom are minorities, participated in research projects or field studies involving six companies this past year that required them to devote at least 120 hours apiece, or a fifth of their course work. Babson College, in Wellesley, has already expressed interest in participating in next year's program.
Mr. Porter also envisions a contingent of M.B.A.'s who would spend two years after graduation in the field, much like the Peace Corps or Teach for America. Students would earn $50,000 a year -- about two-thirds what they could earn at top-notch consulting firms.
The program, which would be run by a New York-based organization that Professor Porter has started, is called the Initiative for a Competitive Inner City. It is being financed initially by Mr. Porter and the business school. Whitney Tilson, a second-year Harvard student who is taking over as director, is a former consultant for the Boston Consulting Group and founding member of Teach for America.
Mr. Porter is also hoping to coax his employer into creating management classes for business owners who need the formal training but lack the cash to put themselves through school. That would greatly help people like Andre Medina, the president of America's Food Basket, a supermarket that caters to Hispanic people. "It's easier for me to learn how to run a computer or do a budget than it is for a big company like Stop & Shop to learn a culture," said Mr. Medina, who is Cuban.
 
A Free Marketer
 Mr. Porter's policy recommendations tilt heavily toward letting the markets do their stuff. In his view, the $210 billion that he says the country spends each year on programs to assist the poor reinforces their dependence on government and does little to create businesses with "long-term, sustainable, competitive advantage," Mr. Porter's mantra.
Instead, he believes, government should improve public transportation, clean up environmental problems that would otherwise swamp a small business, cut red tape and use its powers to condemn real estate to bundle together parcels that could house big business. In other words, funnel the help to businesses that have what it takes to succeed. "There is a role for government, just a different role," he said.
The last time Mr. Porter came up with one of his trademark big ideas, two years ago, he wanted to solve the short-term mind-set in the nation's capital markets. His prescription was ambitious. Too ambitious, perhaps. It won polite reviews, but the recommendations never caught on.
This time, he is not waiting for Washington or Wall Street, but urging his students to take matters into their own hands.
Mr. Settles, 33, for instance, had no idea how much it cost him to make a $3.50 plate of eggs with grits. And it took him nearly a month to find out from his accountant what was selling well.
Three of Mr. Porter's students pinpointed Mr. Settles's costs, standardized the proportions for each menu item, spelled out job descriptions for all 27 employees and produced a training video for new hires. They also helped him buy software for his cash register that gives him instantaneous feedback on sales.
Mr. Settles, a former engineer and salesman for the Digital Equipment Corporation who bought the business in 1990 out of bankruptcy, could not be more delighted. He figures he has received $50,000 in free consulting. "Darryl is very unusual," Mr. Porter said. "He's outward looking and he finds help."
 
Skepticism at First
 Other businesses that the students contacted after poring over lists of all 3,074 businesses that pay taxes in the study area in an effort to find half a dozen or so research subjects were less welcoming. "To be honest," said Mr. Medina, the Dorcester grocer,"at the beginning I said to myself, 'Harvard students, what are they going to know about yucca and plantains and running a grocery store?' "
As it turned out, plenty. Assigned to the project was Edwin Rivera, a Bronx native who can rattle off statistics about the number of Hispanic people living in Boston -- 62,000, give or take a few. He and two classmates prepared financial forecasts and budgets. And they advised Mr. Medina to exploit his expertise with Hispanic customers if he had dreams of expanding.
For a small business that once had trouble enlisting outside support, the personal attention was exhilarating. Mr. Medina recalls, for instance, how one loan agency initially turned him away, even though he was proposing to put $100,000 of his own money into the venture.
But after two Fleet Financial Group bankers who had been standoffish spotted Mr. Medina at Mr. Porter's presentation, they suddenly wanted to do business. "They attacked," Mr. Medina told his new friend, Mr. Porter, over yucca chips and flan in Mr. Medina's office, and a loan is under discussion.
 
Some Special Opportunities
 Mr. Porter says he is not suggesting that minority students give up cashing in their degrees for BMW's and six-figure consulting jobs, if that's what they want. But he does think that they have special opportunities in these communities, a view that Mr. Rivera shares.
"A lot of people look at the inner city and see high crime and low income," said Mr. Rivera, who plans to become a consultant after he graduates. "Me? I wouldn't mind being a passive investor in a business like this. I've seen its operations, and I think it's a money maker."

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Democracy's hardened arteries and Washington's problems.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
HEALTH care reform stalled? Welfare reform on hold? You've heard the reasons before and you'll hear them again: Nothing ever gets done in Washington because the Government has been taken over by plutocrats.
Well, not quite, argues Jonathan Rauch, the author of "Demosclerosis" (Times Books) and contributing editor to The National Journal. "The problem isn't gridlock," he says, "the wheels are out of alignment." Democracy as practiced on the Potomac, he says, has become a bazaar for thousands of interest groups who represent just about everybody -- a place where "too much gets done and too little undone." 
 As Mr. Rauch is first to acknowledge, he borrows freely from the work of Mancur Olson, an economist at the University of Maryland who has spent much of his career explaining why the "market" for government services is inefficient and growing ever more so. But the Olson-Rauch explanation has yet to become part of the conventional wisdom. Indeed, the causes of demosclerosis are often celebrated as the purest expression of a free society.
A century ago, Mr. Rauch suggests, the American system of government worked because it was small and insulated from the immediate wishes of the voters. Mr. Rauch is not sentimental about this earlier form of democracy: Deal making in smoke-filled rooms, he concedes, guaranteed disproportionate influence to the rich and disenfranchised the weak. But politicians did manage to make decisions and deliver services. And elections provided a rough check on their venality and competence.
For better or worse, that system has been eroding for decades. While the dominant rhetoric of American politics remains us-versus-them, Mr. Rauch argues that us has become them. Tens of thousands of groups, as large as the American Association of Retired Persons and as small as opponents to the local landfill site, plead, threaten and bribe in a wasteful, chaotic struggle for influence that corrupts politicians and alienates the general electorate.
Most essayists who serve up Big Problems feel obliged to provide Big Solutions. Not Mr. Rauch. He dismisses the desirability (and practicality) of going backward to a political system in which access to government is limited. He is deeply suspicious of white knights, like Ross Perot, who would hack their way through the cluttered field of interests in the name of the greater good. And he is almost contemptuous of Nader-style populists who believe that the cure to pluralism's ills is more organization designed to "spread that sweet manure" yet further.
What, then, of proposed fixes to make politicians less dependent on campaign contributions, less likely to view electoral politics as a career, less likely to treat the budget as a patronage kitty -- and thus more likely to exert independent judgment on public policy?
Mr. Rauch is not against experiments with term limits, balanced budget rules, public financing of campaigns and other means of making politicians more sensitive to the commonweal. But he is skeptical they would make a big difference, since interest groups would remain free to influence who goes to Washington by influencing the voters back home. And he worries that budget makers would respond to a permanent diet by cutting the muscle rather than the fat.
All that said, Mr. Rauch is not without hope. Much, he argues, could be accomplished simply by convincing the public that the enemy is us. Still more might happen, he suggests, if conservatives understand that flat-out opposition to new taxes has inadvertently loosened the reins on spending and liberals get the point that big government programs aimed at the needy have often been hijacked by the middle class. Most intriguing is Mr. Rauch's hint that the occasional triumphs of the collective good over individual interests in politics could be systematically duplicated.
Consider the Tax Reform Act of 1986. "Demosclerosis" predicts that small, focused lobbies will be more effective than large ones with widely diffuse interests. And by that token, the collective power of 100 lobbies opposing the elimination of small tax breaks should have overwhelmed the good government types who wanted to lower overall tax rates at their expense.
Somehow, though, backers ranging from Senator Bill Bradley to President Ronald Reagan managed to assemble a winning coalition in favor of tax reform that survived long enough to pass the legislation. Similarly, backers of both the Nafta and GATT trade agreements were able to contain the highly focused opposition to competition from imports at least long enough to prevail.
What's missing here is a sense of what it would take to beat the system more systematically, of the changes in political institutions that would give a decisive edge to those who would fight the good fight. But that seems in keeping with Mr. Rauch's inclination to practical opportunism. "Demosclerosis isn't a problem you solve," he writes. "It's a problem you manage."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Little Change in the Dollar As Traders Remain Wary

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar was little changed against other major currencies yesterday, rebounding from early losses as American stocks and bonds recovered from their slumps.
Many traders sold dollars in European trading after a German central banker suggested the Bundesbank would not necessarily support the dollar if it slipped to 1.64 German marks, a level many analysts thought would prompt the world's central banks to defend the dollar. 
 "The Bundesbank is saying that it won't buy dollars unless markets become disorderly by falling too fast," said Amy Smith, senior currency market strategist at IDEA, a consulting firm. That emboldened some traders to try to push the dollar lower, she said.
After rebounding from a low of 1.6410 marks, the dollar was quoted in late New York trading at 1.6469 marks, virtually unchanged from 1.6465 on Monday. It fell to 104.50 Japanese yen, from 104.75 on Monday.
 
Trading in a Narrow Range
 The dollar has traded in narrow ranges against the mark and yen since the Federal Reserve and 18 other central banks teamed up to buy the dollar on May 4 to stem its three-month slide. Traders have been wary of the central banks since then.
"Today was another dull day," said David De Rosa, director of foreign-exchange trading at Swiss Bank Corporation. "It's not much fun to be a trader right now because you can't make any money if these currencies don't move."
With central banks lurking, few traders are willing to sell the dollar, keeping it from falling, Mr. De Rosa said, while pessimism about American stock and bond markets prevents it from gaining. That leaves it stuck in a "miserable range," he said.
"The currency market is taking its vacation in June instead of August this year," said Anil Agarwal, a currency specialist at Brown Brothers Harriman & Company. "It's dead out there."
The dollar pared its early losses against the mark after the Treasury bond market rebounded from an early slump. Bonds rebounded after many commodity prices fell, assuaging some investors' concern that inflation is on the rise.

HEADLINE: A Chic TV Set With Tongue in Cheek

BYLINE: By EVE M. KAHN 

 BODY:
A NEW cable television channel called FX is betting on the drawing power of stylish interior design. The channel, an offspring of Fox Inc. that began national telecasts yesterday, is offering 12 hours a day of campy reruns like "Wonder Woman" and "Nanny and the Professor," plus 7 hours of live news and banter. But the star of the show may be the set.
FX designers have given a 6,500-square-foot studio the look and shape of a suave five-room apartment, complete with bathroom, that takes its cues from every current trend. 
 Sofas by Swaim in the living room bear cartoony profiles in the manner of Philippe Starck; library shelves are loaded with "Addams Family"-style artifacts like preserved beetles and a stuffed mongoose wrestling a snake. Frank Lloyd Wright, the year's hot historical architect, inspired the library's fake stained-glass doors and the rec room's out-of-kilter paneling.
Manhattan regionalism also crept in, although FX is not yet available in New York City (but it can be seen in New Jersey and Westchester County and on Long Island). There's post-industrial SoHo, with arched windows and distressed paint, and buttoned-down Upper East Side, with lots of neo-classical side tables, french doors and Clarence House fabrics. The apartment reflects the West Coast as well, in the looping forms of a lamp by Goodman Charlton of Los Angeles.
The set's designer, Chris Shriver, who has helped plan the sets for "Crooklyn," "The Prince of Tides" and "Malcolm X," among other movies, considers the FX apartment "hip enough to hold up to the sensibilities of both coasts and not be too much for the people in the middle."
Unlike other residential backdrops for nonfiction television, like the morning news shows' cluttered bookcases and MTV's industrial lofts, FX's set is actually habitable. Every room contains four walls and real windows. There's a double bed in the bedroom, wine glasses in the glass-fronted kitchen cabinets and a working claw-foot tub in the bathroom.
Program hosts roam on screen, perhaps shampooing a dog in the tub for a feature called "The Pet Department," interviewing starlets in the library or listening to live bands in the ballroom with nine layers of crumbling paint.
Passers-by can glimpse the set through the second-floor windows of a turn-of-the-century office tower at 212 Fifth Avenue (26th Street). And in a few months, first-floor renovations will also reveal the multiscreen FX control room to street traffic.
Such visibility seems popular in the television industry. On June 20, NBC will move the "Today" show to a ground-floor studio with two walls of windows at 49th Street and Rockefeller Plaza. But only FX has ever built a full-blown, four-walled apartment for news and talk.
"I can't think of anyone else who's gone to that level of extravagance," said Dr. J. Fred MacDonald, a television and radio historian at Northeastern Illinois University.
Well-known manufacturers supplied many of the set's furnishings, sometimes in exchange for on-air credits, and antiques dealers provided almost all the rest. HLW, a New York architectural firm, handled the structural renovations, and the construction and furnishing took just 10 weeks. To insure swift delivery, the set's decorator, Carolyn Cartwright, carried an armchair on her head from the flea market a block away on the Avenue of the Americas.
What most viewers won't see is the sleight of hand. Seat cushions are hard, so that guests and hosts do not slouch. "Parquet" floors are vinyl, to muffle the sound of heels. Snarls of wiring and spotlights cover the ceilings.
The rec room's bricks are actually fiberglass (known to set designers as "murder brick," because their molds were first used 30 years ago for the film "How to Murder Your Wife"). Bookcases that look like walnut are particleboard.
In person, the hot-rod wall colors seem painfully bright, "so that they'll jump out at you as you surf through channels," Mr. Shriver said.
No one at FX would discuss exact budgets, but David J. Evans, the head of Fox's FX production unit, described the set as "economically attractive in the long run, even though it's expensive now."
But what if FX doesn't succeed?
Then, said Dr. MacDonald, the historian, its apartment set may end up as an unused parody of late-20th-century domestic life, "a metaphor for the devouring of the American home by television."

Where Earth and Sky Meet: A Wright Cottage, for Rent

BYLINE: By PAUL GOLDBERGER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LAKE DELTON, Wis., May 26

 BODY:
There are Frank Lloyd Wright houses that can be visited because they have become museums, like Fall ingwater and Wright's own Taliesin, and there are Frank Lloyd Wright houses that can be bought to live in forever, usually at a substantial price. But there is only one Frank Lloyd Wright house that anyone can possess, in its entirety, for a night. It is called the Seth Peterson Cottage, and it is where people go to decide for themselves what the Wright mystique is all about.
The cottage is one of the most remarkable things that Wright ever designed: A compact, intense composition, an 880-square-foot summary of his late work, it has a spectacular living room of glass and wood that appears to burst out of a simple stone structure. Sharply angled yet serene, the house possesses an extraordinary quality that can only be called monumentality in miniature. It confers on its visitors both the gift of architecture and the gift of privacy, and together these two things create an experience that is equaled by no other Wright building. 
 It isn't the architecture alone that does it, for this is far from the greatest Wright house: it is a sonnet dashed off late in life by a master of epics. But sitting in isolation on a wooded site above Mirror Lake near here, on land that is now part of a state park, this tiny cottage is a triumphant shout of the spirit in the quiet of the landscape.
The tale of the house is a strange and sad story. It was never built to be rented out by the night. The house was commissioned in 1957, two years before Wright's death at 92, by Seth Peterson, a computer programmer in his 20's who had grown up in Black Earth, about an hour's drive south of here and not far from Wright's home in Spring Green, Wis. Mr. Peterson, who shared Wright's birthday -- June 8 -- admired Wright's work to the point of obsession, and nagged the architect to design a house for him, but Wright, busy with such major projects as the Guggenheim Museum, rejected his overtures. Finally, Mr. Peterson sent Wright a check for $1,000 as a retainer, which the perpetually cash-starved architect quickly spent. Lacking the cash to return the fee, Wright had to design the house.
Construction began early in 1959 and continued after Wright's death in April of that year. Mr. Peterson, whose finances seemed to have had as much of an air of make-believe about them as Wright's, tried to keep down the cost (originally estimated at under $35,000) by doing some construction himself. But Mr. Peterson had neither Wright's bravado nor his consistent ability to deny unpleasant reality, and he grew increasingly despondent as his money grew tight and other personal problems mounted. In 1960, shortly before the house was finished, he committed suicide.
The tiny dream house was bought and completed by a Milwaukee family, one of whose members lived in it for six years with a pack of Afghan hounds. He sold it in 1966 for $36,000 to the State of Wisconsin, which was buying up properties in the area to expand the adjacent Mirror Lake State Park. The state spared the house the fate of demolition that it accorded most of the other properties, but only out of a vague sense that it would not be a good idea to tear down a Frank Lloyd Wright building. In truth, state officials had little idea of what to do with the house, and it was boarded up and left to decay.
And so it remained for 20 years, a tiny, haunted ruin. Enter Audrey Laatsch, a retired psychotherapist from Milwaukee who lived nearby, and who had periodically climbed over the fence to explore the house. It was fairly intact the first time she saw it, Ms. Laatsch recalled, "but we watched it deteriorate." By the time they noticed that there were holes in the roof, with rain pouring through to destroy Wright's woodwork, Ms. Laatsch and several neighbors "just decided we had to do something about it, and I was put in charge."
"I loved Frank Lloyd Wright," she said, "but I knew nothing about preservation, and I had no idea what I was getting into."
Early in 1989, a meeting was called to discuss the fate of the cottage, and 60 neighbors and Wright aficionados showed up, including John Eifler, a Chicago architect who has restored other Wright buildings. He offered his services at a reduced rate, and Ms. Laatsch hired him on the spot.
"I had absolutely no authority, no funds, no legal organization, nothing," she said. "We weren't even sure what to do with the cottage once we restored it. But then I told a friend about it, and she said the idea of this little Frank Lloyd Wright house in the woods seemed so romantic, she would love to stay there. And I knew that was it. I realized that if she would want to come and stay here, hundreds of other people would, too."
The group incorporated as the Seth Peterson Cottage Conservancy and negotiated a lease with the State Parks Department to operate the house as a rental cottage. The conservancy managed to get a $50,000 grant from the Wisconsin State Department of Natural Resources to start the restoration. In the fall of 1989, volunteers took the boards off and cleaned up the debris that had filled the cottage, and the following spring the Wisconsin Conservation Corps took off the deteriorated roof and dismantled the flagstone floor, numbering each stone and mapping it for replacement.
It took years, both because of a scarcity of funds and the conservancy's determination to restore the house as Wright and Mr. Peterson had conceived it, which in some cases meant doing more than fixing what had broken. The original contractor had put in forced-air heating instead of the radiant heating under the floor that Wright had specified, and numerous pieces of furniture Wright designed for the house were never built. The Frank Lloyd Wright Archives provided the original plans and specifications so the restored version could correct the omissions.
Eventually, the restoration cost roughly $300,000, and the job was completed in mid-1992 only with the help of a last-minute grant from the Jeffris Family Foundation in Wisconsin, and several gifts of such materials as windows from Pella and a refrigerator from Sub-Zero, companies whose products were specified by Wright for the house. Mr. Eifler added some Wrightian furniture to finish the interior, and the cottage was in business.
The conservancy has never advertised the cottage, but the network of Wrightophiles is apparently advertisement enough: It is fully booked through November, and some people have already reserved dates well into 1995. (One visitor has come from as far as Perth, Australia.) Since Mirror Lake State Park has cross-country skiing trails, it has become attractive as a winter destination as well as a summer one, and the one-bedroom cottage has already been the site of several weddings and numerous honeymoons and anniversary escapes.
The house is Frank Lloyd Wright boiled down to his essence: Powerful geometric form; low, contained spaces played off against exuberantly high ones; a sense of natural materials put together into a composition that at once seems to hug the earth and blast off from it. From the outside, it is at once serene and energetic. A solid section of stone, barely bigger than a chimney, anchors the center. The low horizontal of the bedroom ceiling comes off from one side, and the high, raked roof of the living-dining room bursts out from the other. The solids and the voids, the lows and the highs, the horizontals and the verticals, are in harmony.
There is none of the Buck Rogers air of some of Wright's other work done at the same time. The comrades of this house are really Wright's "Usonian" houses of several years earlier, the simple, straightforward houses built to prove Wright's lifelong belief that his architecture could be affordable on a middle-class budget. (It rarely was, but most of the Usonians are marvelous nonetheless.)
But the Seth Peterson Cottage has an energy, even an exuberance, that carries it beyond many Usonians to recall several other Wright houses from the 1940's and early 1950's -- like the Sturges House in Brentwood, Calif., or the Rose Pauson house in Phoenix -- where Wright also used stone to anchor wood and glass, and the house at once embraced the earth and soared above it. Whether the Peterson design took the form it did because Wright did not want to bother giving Seth Peterson his very latest ideas, or because he saw this vocabulary as right for this wooded site high above the lake, no one will never know. But it is clear that, whether he wanted to dispose of Mr. Peterson quickly or not, Wright delved back into his work to produce here something that was not a replay of what he had done before, but a nearly perfect, miniaturized synthesis of a critical phase of his career.
There is only one real room to this cottage, a glass-walled living-dining area that rises to true monumentality as it confronts the woods and the lake below. It is dominated by a vast hearth, and the walls are lined with the relatively uncomfortable built-in seating that Wright favored. The kitchen is a small alcove off this room, and the bedroom and bath, while private, are low-ceilinged and unexceptional.
The door takes visitors directly into the high main space, uncharacteristic for Wright, who preferred to squeeze you under a low ceiling at first so as to enhance the experience of grand space later. The economies of space at the Seth Peterson Cottage made Wright's normal mode of tight entrance impossible, since the last thing Mr. Peterson could afford was a vestibule. But I suspect there was another reason Wright did the little cottage this way, and I realized it after I spent the night: The moment of entrance that really matters is not when you arrive at the building's front door, but when you awake in the morning and move from the bedroom into the living room.
There, suddenly, it all opens up, from the tiny, cocoonlike bedroom, a retreat from the world, back into the world. The symbolism is all of opening, more and more with each moment, as you go from the bedroom, which is off the back of the living room where the ceiling is low, and move around the huge hearth into the center of the living room itself. The ceiling rises higher and higher with each step, the windows grow taller, and the view of the landscape looms ever larger.
That was what Wright was after: An architectural expression of awakening, a chance to move through space in a way that would symbolize the literal return to the world that awakening means. It was not merely for economy that he designed the bedroom to be as small, and as enclosed, as it is; it is nothing but a protective tent, symbolizing the night as the great space symbolizes the day.
It is for the day, and the great space, that the house exists. It is trite to speak of Wright in terms of connections with nature, but in fact when you sit in the living room and the whole feeling of the space changes as a cloud passes over the sun, it seems not trite at all, but very real. It's no accident that the guest book in the house is filled with comments from visitors who are awed at the serenity they feel, and who observe that the house has brought them closer to some sense of themselves.
It was never Wright's goal to erase the distinction between humankind and nature, and certainly not to defer to nature; Wright's architecture is so assertive that it forces you to think of him as much as you think of the landscape you are looking at. But this house, this balcony perched within the woods overlooking Mirror Lake, intensifies our sense of nature as a frame focuses attention on a picture. Yet it forces attention inward, too, and this is perhaps its greatest gift. The cottage is at once a protective enclosure and a stage projecting us out into the landscape; it nurtures and it energizes, all at the same time.

HEADLINE: On Broadway, the Numbers Are on the Rise

BYLINE: By BRUCE WEBER 

 BODY:
Broadway attendance this season rose to its highest level in six years, according to statistics released yesterday by the League of American Theaters and Producers, a North American trade association for the commercial theater industry. A total of 8.1 million people saw performances in one of Broadway's 35 theaters during the just-concluded 1993-94 season, up from 7.9 million a year ago.
The total audience was the largest since 1987-88, when about 30,000 more people attended Broadway shows. The record, 11 million, occurred in the 1980-81 season; the record low, 5.4 million, in 1972-73. 
 In addition, the league said, the total gross receipts for Broadway shows and touring shows this season exceeded $1 billion for the first time. Broadway's gross receipts were $356 million, while a total of 33 road companies, including eight new productions, brought in $688 million.
 
Belies Pessimism
 After a season that many in the theater profession deemed subpar, with Broadway dominated by revivals and many nonmusicals opening and closing in short order, the figures counterbalance the pessimism that has afflicted the industry. Indeed, by many measures the season ended on a distinct economic uptick.
The number of new productions, 37, was up from 33 in the 1992-93 season. So was the number of total weeks that shows ran in theaters: 1,061 this season; 1,018 last. The season got off to a slow start last summer and fall, but eight weeks ago it eclipsed last year's attendance, helped by the opening of 13 new shows since the last week of March. Twenty-five shows are currently running, compared with 21 at Christmas and 19 at the end of last season.
George Wachtel, the league's director of research, said that about 200,000 people were attending Broadway shows every week, up from 150,000 in the fall.
"The reason is very simple," Mr. Wachtel said. "There are more shows."

AIR PRODUCTS RAISES ESTIMATE ON DERIVATIVES CHARGE

BYLINE: Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Air Products and Chemicals Inc. has increased to $14 million the estimate of a third-quarter charge for losses on derivatives trading. The third-quarter charge is in addition to a $60 million charge on trading losses for the second quarter, which the company reported last month. Air Products, based in Allentown, Pa., said last month that the third-quarter charge would probably be $9 million for losses on international interest-rate derivatives. The charge turned out to be larger because the company also decided to end two currency derivatives contracts at a loss. Derivatives are investments that are tied to -- or derived from -- the performance of an underlying asset, like a currency, or the performance of a financial market.

HEADLINE: Punitive Damages Denied In Beating of Rodney King

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, June 1

 BODY:
A jury refused today to award Rodney G. King punitive damages from the police officers who were present during his beating in 1991, absolving them of individual responsibility for the kicks and baton blows that shocked the nation.
The same jury had earlier ordered the City of Los Angeles to pay Mr. King $3.8 million in compensation for the beating. 
 The city appeared quiet as the verdicts were announced, but the Los Angeles Police Department briefly went on tactical alert, holding officers over at the end of the day shift in case of violence.
The jury forewoman dabbed at her eyes as the verdicts were read after 11 days of deliberation. When members of the six-woman, three-man panel were each asked if they agreed with the verdicts, the only black juror, a middle-aged woman, appeared to struggle with her emotions before sighing and responding, "Yes."
Later, the juror said: "It's purely black and white. You can interpret it any way you want to. There was no justice here. There was no justice at all." Her name, like the names of the other jurors, has not been made public.
 
'Both Extremes'
 The forewoman, a Filipino-American, said the panel struggled to reach a consensus. "We had both extremes," she said. "Some thought the officers were just doing their duty. Others felt it was excessive force with malice."
An aunt of Mr. King, Angela King, told KCBS-TV, "I was really shocked, surprised and very disappointed to know that people out there had no feelings, none whatsoever, for what happened to my nephew."
Mr. King's lawyer, John Burris, said there was a strong likelihood of an appeal. "It appears the jurors concluded enough is enough and the officers had suffered enough." But, he added, "it sends the wrong message to police officers that they may not be held accountable for acts of misconduct if they blame it on the city."
Deputy City Attorney Don Vincent, who represented two of the officers, said: "I think it is just for everybody. It's a great day for law enforcement."
The jury also decided a countersuit by one of the officers, Theodore J. Briseno, finding that Mr. King had battered him during the arrest. But it declined to assess punitive damages.
The racially mixed jury ruled that two former officers, Stacey C. Koon and Lawrence M. Powell, who are now serving 30-month prison terms for violating Mr. King's civil rights, acted with malice in the beating.
It said the four other defendants, including Officer Briseno, did not violate Mr. King's civil rights or act with malice.
 
The Final Verdicts
 Barring appeals, the verdicts are the last in the case, bringing to an end a tumultuous period in Los Angeles that included three trials and political and social upheaval, all spawned by 81 seconds of videotape of the March 3, 1991, beating of Mr. King, an unemployed construction worker.
In the first phase of Mr. King's civil suit, the city conceded its liability in his beating. In the second phase, Mr. King originally sought punitive damages from 15 current and former police officers, including the officers who beat him, other officers who were at the scene, and their former Chief, Daryl F. Gates.
Judge John G. Davies of Federal District Court dropped most of the defendants, including Mr. Gates, who retired nearly two years ago. The remaining six were the four officers who were defendants in two earlier criminal trials as well as two officers who had never been charged in the beating.
Lawyers for the six defendants argued that they had little money and that the four original defendants had already been financially ruined by the years of litigation. Mr. King's lawyers conceded that there might be little money to be had, but urged jurors to "send a message" about police behavior.
"I've never had a situation where the officers were so destitute as a consequence of the case itself," Mr. Burris acknowledged before the verdict.
In addition to Mr. Koon and Mr. Powell, the defendants included Mr. Briseno and former Officer Timothy E. Wind, who were acquitted in the Federal trial.
All four officers had been acquitted of assault in a state trial whose verdicts on April 29, 1992, ignited a riot that took more than 50 lives and caused an estimated $1 billion in damage.
Officer Briseno, the only one of the original four defendants who is still on the police force, remains on unpaid leave and is contesting a departmental move to dismiss him.
The remaining two defendants were Officers Rolando Solano and Louis Turriaga, who helped take Mr. King into custody after the beating.
Mr. Wind was the only defendant present when the verdicts were read. Asked if his ordeal was now over, he said: "It's the King case. It's never over with. It's made a wreck of our lives, a wreck of the city and of our profession."
 
Step by Step
 The jury's deliberations in the second phase began on May 17, and it soon became apparent that the panel was taking a thorough approach when it asked for freeze-frame video equipment and copies of the 1991 Christopher Commission report on the Los Angeles Police Department.
In its deliberations, the jury was first required to determine if each defendant violated Mr. King's constitutional rights, then if he acted with malice and reckless disregard for Mr. King's rights, if punitive damages against him were appropriate, and if so, how much. In the cases of Mr. Koon and Mr. Powell, the answer to the first question was already determined when they were found guilty in the Federal trial.
Mr. King's civil suit did not arouse the kind of passions of the earlier two criminal trials, either within the courtroom or on the city's streets. Most of the evidence and much of the arguments were identical to what had been presented twice before.
 
'Traumatized' Nation
 Evidence in the first phase focused on the extent of Mr. King's physical and psychological injuries, and in the second phase on the roles played by the individual defendants.
After winning $3.8 million in the first phase of the suit, Mr. Burris asked jurors to award $3.8 million to $15 million more in the second phase.
"It should be enough to show these officers this conduct is reprehensible to society," he said.
As in the earlier trials, the officers argued that Mr. King led them on a long, high-speed chase that night, then fought back when they tried to handcuff him. They said the beating was justified because of threatening movements by Mr. King.
Repeating his earlier defense almost word for word, Mr. Powell's lawyer, Michael P. Stone, said: "These officers get paid to win, not lose. These officers do not get paid to roll around in the dirt with the likes of Rodney King."
And Mr. Koon's lawyer, Ira Salzman, said, as he has said before: "How much is enough? He has $20 to his name, a career gone, sitting in an 8-by-7-foot cell. Punishment? In the name of the law, what more should be done? Nothing."

HEADLINE: Margaret S. Gordon, 83, Dies; Economist and Prolific Author

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
Dr. Margaret Shaughnessy Gordon, who became a prominent economist in an academic discipline long dominated by men, died on Saturday at her home in Berkeley, Calif. She was 83.
The cause was cancer, her family said. 
 Dr. Gordon was a professor of economics at the University of California at Berkeley, where she had served as associate director of the Institute of Industrial Relations from 1954 until 1969. She produced numerous books and studies on health, welfare, employment and, later, higher education.
One of her books, "Employment Expansion and Population Growth: The California Experience, 1900-1950," published in 1954, was among the first analyses to arrive at the conclusion that California, more than any other state, depended on military spending. Another, "Social Security Policies in Industrial Countries: An International Perspective" (Cambridge University Press, 1989) remains in print.
Other books by Dr. Gordon included "Barrier to World Trade" (1941), "The Economics of Welfare Policies" (1963), "Retraining and Labor Market Adjustment in Western Europe" (1965), and "Youth Education and Unemployment Problems: An International Perspective" (1979).
 
Role in War on Poverty
 She drafted more than a dozen reports for the Carnegie Commission and Council on Higher Education while serving consecutively as associate director of both from 1969 to 1979. In 1968, President Lyndon B. Johnson named her to the Commission on Income Maintenance Programs to examine all "welfare and related programs" in his War on Poverty.
A native of Wabasha, Minn., she graduated from Bryn Mawr College and received her Ph.D. from Harvard University in 1935. In World War II she worked in the Federal Government's Office of Price Administration.
Dr. Gordon's husband, Robert A. Gordon, who died in 1978 after the couple had been married 42 years, was also a Harvard-educated ecomonics professor, as were her two sons. In Berkeley she was active in civic affairs and was a committeewoman with the Democratic Party of Alameda County. Her husband was also a professor of economics at Berkeley.
She is survived by her sons, Robert J., of Evanston, Ill., an economics professor at Northwestern University, and David M., of Manhattan, a professor of economics at the New School for Social Research. .

HEADLINE: Bad Memories in Italy

 BODY:
A stinging historical irony awaits President Clinton when he begins his tour of emotive World War II battle sites with a visit to Italy's Nettuno cemetery tomorrow. Buried there are thousands of valiant U.S. and Allied soldiers who died holding the embattled Anzio beachhead on their way to expelling Nazi occupiers from Rome and destroying the remnants of Benito Mussolini's Fascist regime. Like those soldiers a half-century ago, Mr. Clinton encounters an Italy where Fascism is a political force and followers of Mussolini hold high office.
The President, the first Western leader to meet Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi since he included ministers from the Fascist-descended National Alliance in his coalition Cabinet, correctly insists on judging the Alliance by its deeds, not its ancestry. But those deeds already warrant close scrutiny. 
 It is not Il Duce all over again, of course. Mussolini ruled Italy through black-shirted thugs and joined Germany and Japan in an Axis bent on world conquest. Today's Italy is a democracy and a NATO ally. The Alliance earned its share of power by winning millions of votes in a fair election. There is no way to deny the Alliance's legitimacy without violating democratic values. But neither should Americans gloss over the unpleasant reality of Fascism's political revival in the land of its birth.
Alliance leaders say their ideology is a kind of "post-Fascism" that upholds the supposedly good aspects of Mussolini's doctrine while repudiating the bad. They profess loyalty to democracy, NATO and the European Union and are quick to distance themselves from skinhead violence and other ugly aspects of the Fascist inheritance.
But the Alliance's post-Fascist claims have been dented by a sequence of nasty incidents. On May 14, when black-shirted skinheads marched through Vicenza giving Fascist salutes, the Alliance's leader, Gianfranco Fini, dismissed them as "airheads" and not so reassuringly suggested they should be sent to work in salt mines. Provocations have continued, however, leading Interior Minister Roberto Maroni to warn of a new cycle of political terrorism like that of the 1970's.
There is also a belligerent new tone to Italian foreign policy. Last month the Alliance's Mirko Tremaglia declared that Italy's treaty with the former Yugoslavia should be "ripped up" to press old Italian territorial claims. Last week Mr. Tremaglia was elected chairman of the Parliament's foreign affairs commission. Days later Italy forced Slovenia, site of some of those claims, off a list of prospective new members of the European Union.
Then last Sunday Piero Buscaroli, an Alliance candidate for the European Parliament, chillingly evoked memories of Fascism's worst horrors by declaring of gays that "if it were up to me, I'd send them all to live in concentration camps."
Each of these incidents can be explained away, but together they constitute a disturbing trend. Fascism got its second chance in Italy mainly because corruption scandals destroyed centrist political parties. But economic discontents are also reviving Fascist fortunes elsewhere in Europe.
The 50th anniversary of the assault on Axis Europe is a time to celebrate a heroic crusade for political freedom by America and its allies. But it is also a time to recall the damage Fascism inflicted on Europe in the not-so-distant past. When "post-Fascist" parties talk about ripping up treaties and sending people to concentration camps, they must be taken seriously and called to account.

Reactor Roulette

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Stalinist North Korea watched the way Serbia diddled the "Great Powers" of the West -- a promise here, a false concession there -- and proceeded to use the same technique on the "Great Powers" of the East.
Duplicity worked again; years of hand-wringing diplomacy gave North Korea time to produce enough fissionable material for perhaps a half-dozen nuclear bombs. 
 We must now decide whether to continue the protracted runaround, hoping vainly that Kim Il Sung wants only to be bought off, or to enforce international law -- which would require the credible threat of war. We have seen how the lack of such resolve failed in the West; now we will see if we can make our threat believable in the East.
Once again, the U.S. will take the lead in trying to marshal the forces of its allies. Under color of a U.N. Security Council resolution, we will seek to coerce the nuclear lawbreaker by means of economic sanctions.
That means blockade. Japan must stop the flow of hard-currency remittances to the dictatorship from its Korean residents. China and South Korea must close their borders to all trade with North Korea, including vital oil. And U.S. armed forces must interdict sea supply of Pyongyang.
North Korea has said it would consider any of that an act of war. That's accurate; a blockade, even euphemized as "sanctions" and legitimated by world bodies, is an act of war.
What would North Korea, with strangulation in prospect, then do?
One alternative is the one we hope for: to recognize that the world's threat of war is credible and to "join the family of nations." Because no more reactor roulette would be tolerated, the North would back down before its plutonium could be developed into bombs and placed on missiles being built to threaten Seoul, Tokyo and Shanghai.
The North's other alternative is the one we dread: to launch Korean War II and invade the South. That would engage the United States, with 37,000 troops on hand to back up longstanding treaty commitments; we would then be in a real war with an enemy that fought us to a standstill two generations ago.
What should the U.S. do to give Kim Il Sung incentives to end nuclear blackmail and admit inspectors?
First, get absolute, public assurances from Japan that no leakage will be permitted, and that it will wage economic war. Russia should also announce its intention to isolate the nuclear outlaw.
Second, tell South Korea that its days of appeasement and complacency are over -- no more only 4 percent of G.N.P. for defense -- and full-scale mobilization is in order; its forces would bear the brunt of the first attack, as U.S. bombers destroy the North's nuclear potential.
Third, reach an understanding with China that neutrality is not enough: if the North besieges Seoul, allies expect Chinese "volunteers" to stream across the Yalu to threaten North Korea's capital.
Nice work if you can do it, especially that long reach about China threatening its traditional Communist ally. But the U.S. is not helpless in leading the Eastern Powers toward posing a threat to North Korea strong enough to discourage war.
President Clinton could say to the allies: If you are with us, we are with you. Together we can pose the immensely credible threat; if that doesn't work -- if we are dealing with madmen -- together we can make short work of the war.
On the other hand, he could say, you are not doing us a favor. If you are not with us in stopping nuclear spread here and now -- we're out of the Far East. Work out your own collective security and good luck.
If China, Japan, Russia and South Korea are not worried about enforcing international law to protect those cities from nuclear missiles, why should we put our troops at risk?
The United States should join willing allies to intervene strongly -- or else extricate itself fast. If our leadership of proliferation police is rejected, we should await better leaders there and here; we can use the savings from troops drawn down to build a space shield, thereby protecting America from the next decade's nuclear bandits.
We share a vital interest with every civilized nation in stopping the spread of nukes. But if our allies East or West dither or choose isolation, we should wish them well and invest in the most advanced self-protection.

HEADLINE: No Hedging Now on World Trade Agreement

 BODY:
To the Editor:
There is much talk now about a "waiver" of recent budget rules to relieve the Government of accounting for the costs of a General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade as part of the costs of government. Senator Max Baucus tells us that GATT will produce great benefits in increased economic growth, which will more than offset its estimated costs of $14 billion over 5 years and some $43 billion over 10 years. A waiver will simply allow "reality" to check in and save us all from the inconvenience of attempting to reduce the growth of the Federal deficit. 
 But for years we have been told of "success" from the day the agreement was completed. Why wait to see what benefit actually emerges -- declare success before anyone sees the problems or has to confront the costs. In the end, we cannot know about "success" until some time elapses.
Charles McMillion, in an analysis of United States internationally traded products, noticed that United States net exports have moved from a very, very modest surplus in the 1950's, through a series of "trade liberalizing" negotiations in the 60's (Kennedy Round) and 70's (Tokyo Round) down to a massive series of deficits running throughout the later 70's to the present. ("Ten Key New Issues Facing the U.S. Economy," MBG Information Services.)
Why, in the face of the evidence, do we continue to believe this round will be great for us and generate huge national wealth? We know that we have witnessed a massive transfer of wealth from the United States overseas, a transfer that left us a debtor and surely was not unrelated to earlier trade negotiations. Indeed, they have been at least partly responsible.
The Uruguay Round, like its predecessors, will open United States markets to more imports and more competition from all sources. In some products, these will come from the output of factories owned by United States corporations and established in foreign investment climates rendered more comfortable as a result of the Uruguay Rounds agreements.
Auto investment expands in Brazil, computers expand in Singapore and China, and down the road, the United States will be importing from all of them. In soft goods, like clothing, the flood will accelerate from virtually everywhere, with devastating effect on domestic workers. But we would prefer to believe in rosy promises and hence find proponents of the budget "waiver."
The "waiver" issue is a major one, and for good reason. Just how can the financial markets, or anyone else for that matter, take Congress seriously about deficit reduction if each time a hot program comes along there is a waiver. This time GATT, next time what? Health care? Aid to Bosnia? Invasion of Haiti? A post office in Peoria?
If we can afford to ignore our budgetary needs for the GATT, how can we deny a similar look-the-other-way approach to the health needs of 30-plus million of the medically uninsured? I would bet that dollars spent on better health care for them will in time generate more wealth for the country than the Uruguay Round.
And if a member of Congress can vote a waiver to give the President his GATT agreement, what kind of deal will he demand in return? What "waivers" will he need? For a country worried about a return of inflation, budget waivers for GATT are a very bad idea.

HEADLINE: Developer and M.T.A. Reach Agreement on Coliseum Site

BYLINE: By SHAWN G. KENNEDY 

 BODY:
Nine years after he first agreed to pay $455 million for the right to build a huge complex on the site of the New York Coliseum, Mortimer B. Zuckerman reached an agreement yesterday to buy half the site for less than a quarter of the original price, officials said.
Under the agreement, expected to be completed today, Mr. Zuckerman will pay $80 million for one of the potentially most valuable development sites in New York City. 
 The Giuliani administration, which for months has been pressing the Coliseum's owner, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, to come to terms with the developer, would put up $20 million to complete a $100 million purchase price.
The agreement calls for Mr. Zuckerman to build a one-million-square-foot office building with some retail stores. The developer, who also owns The Daily News, would immediately put up a $17 million nonrefundable down payment, be obligated to close on the deal by April 30, 1995, and begin construction a year later.
But while the agreement is a turning point in the tangled history of the property at 59th Street and Columbus Avenue, it does not automatically mean that the project Mr. Zuckerman is proposing will actually be built, as the agreement includes several conditions that he is supposed to meet during the next 10 months, including securing a major tenant.
Officials who have participated in the years of wrangling over the site seemed more relieved than victorious. Peter Stangl, chairman of the M.T.A. board, acknowledged that he would have preferred a fresh start on the project with a new developer, but said he felt that the public was being served.
"We can get on with our lives," he said. "This deal could have been done months ago."
A spokesman for Mr. Zuckerman said the developer was going over the details of the deal, but he said Mr. Zuckerman had agreed to the broad outlines. Mr. Stangl and city officials said they were confident that Mr. Zuckerman would sign a letter of intent in time to present it to a hastily arranged meeting of the M.T.A. board today.
Although Mr. Zuckerman has been trying for months to negotiate a lower price for the Coliseum site, the deal yesterday did not represent a total victory for him. Mr. Zuckerman had sought to build his project in stages on the entire Coliseum site, which reaches from 58th Street to 60th Street.
He was also reported to be unhappy with having to put up a nonrefundable deposit.
If there is a winner, however, it is Deputy Mayor John S. Dyson, who has pressed relentlessly for a project on behalf of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, insisting it would produce much-needed construction jobs and that it would be a sign that the city's economy is rebounding.
"All of our objective will be accomplished," Mr. Dyson said. "I am relieved that we have a project instead of a fight and I look forward to the day when we can start the project."
The agreement avoided by hours a trial that was to begin yesterday, in which Mr. Zuckerman was charging that his existing $338 million contract to build on the property was not valid. On Tuesday after lawyers for all parties informed State Supreme Court Judge Ira Gammerman, who was to preside over the nonjury trial, that they were close to an agreement, the judge postponed the start of the trial, first by five hours and then by one day.
 
June 10 Deadline
 In addition to the trial, Mr. Zuckerman faced a June 10 deadline requiring him to close on the existing contract or forfeit a $33.8 million letter of credit.
In the end it was details, such as who would pay the cost of rebuilding the neglected parking garage, rather than the major terms, like the purchase price, that threatened to put the parties in court.
When asked about the process, Mr. Dyson said: "The odd thing is we agreed on the price so long ago, but the small points end up being agony."
Mr. Dyson said the negotiations were complicated by the "three-cornered obligations" of the transaction and by the long history of the project.
"There was a certain amount of rigidity on the part of some of the people involved," Mr. Dyson said, "and I thought it was the city's role to be a facilitator."
Although the City Council has no power to block the new deal, recently some members urged the M.T.A. and the city to find a way out of the contract so that the project could start over. Several members had raised concerns that because of long delays and confusion over the value of the property, the public was not getting its money's worth.
 
A Vocal Critic
 The most vocal of the Council critics has been Ronnie Eldridge, a Democrat whose Upper West Side district includes the Coliseum. Yesterday Ms. Eldridge denounced the deal, "If this is what the Giuliani administration means by privatization, then we are in more trouble than I thought."
In recent months she had also criticized the Giuliani administration for pressuring the M.T.A. to make a deal with Mr. Zuckerman, suggesting that the Mayor's aides were assisting a political supporter, whose newspaper endorsed Mr. Giuliani in the mayoral race last November.
Administration officials have repeatedly denied the accusation, and yesterday the Mayor said: "A lot of the things that have been said are scurrilous attacks. We have viewed this on the merits, made the decision on the merits and we are hopeful it will work."
 
Upgrading Parking Garage
 In addition to the $80 million that Mr. Zuckerman would pay for the property, the new transaction calls for him to pay the estimated $6 million cost to upgrade the parking garage, to put up half of the projected $5 million in mandated subway improvements and to pay the $2.5 million cost of having the office building separated from the exhibition hall.
Moreover, Mr. Zuckerman must have a lease with a major tenant by March 1 of next year, have construction financing by April 15 and close on the contract by April 30. Although the commercial real-estate market has shown signs of recovery in recent months, Mr. Zuckerman's task of finding a tenant and a lender will not be easy. Some banks are still reeling from bad real estate loans made in the 1980's, and are reluctant to put money into new development projects. Despite the spectacular Central Park views that await tenants in the new Coliseum development, the demand for office space in the neighborhood, brokers say, has not been tested because Columbus Circle is not a real office district.
In addition to the M.T.A. board, the transaction must also be approved by the Industrial Development Agency and by Mayor Giuliani.
The battle over development at the Coliseum had been going nearly a decade, but in the last year the lines have been drawn more sharply as the city, M.T.A. and the developer struggled to strike a deal that would serve all their interests. Citing the depressed real-estate market, Mr. Zuckerman wanted a smaller project at a lower price, the M.T.A. wanted a price for the property it could justify to the public, and the city wanted a new development and the jobs it would bring.
In was nine years ago that Mr. Zuckerman with his partners Edward Linde and Salomon Brothers won the competition to replace a tired-looking exhibition hall and office building with an ultramodern development of offices, apartments, stores and restaurants.
But no sooner was the ink dry on the contract than community residents, environmentalists, preservationists and advocates for Central Park joined forces to block the huge development. In one eye-catching appeal for support, hundreds of demonstrators stood shoulder to shoulder with raised umbrellas in that park to symbolize the shadow the proposed towers, one 68 stories, the other 58, would cast over the park's southwest corner.
A series of lawsuits over the size of the project kept it in limbo for seven years, and Salomon Brothers bowed out as the equity partner in 1987, unwilling to wait any longer.
Meanwhile Mr. Zuckerman scaled down his project and the price on the property was lowered to $338 million.
The last lawsuit one was cleared in September 1992, making way for a closing on the 1989 deal.
But as the M.T.A. tried to force a closing of the deal, Mr. Zuckerman resisted and tried to arrange a lower purchase price. Last summer, the agency called on Mayor David N. Dinkins to join forces with the M.T.A. to force a closing.
Dinkins officials said the city needed more time to negotiate an agreement with the M.T.A. that would expand the city's role in any future deal for the property. But after Mr. Dinkins lost the election he joined with the M.T.A. in pressing for a closing on the property.
Both Mr. Zuckerman and the Mayor-elect criticized this change of position by the former Mayor. Mr. Giuliani referred to the move as "political vindictiveness."
But in March it was Mr. Giuliani's turn to feel criticism after Mr. Dyson proposed that the city restore $50 million in M.T.A. budget cuts as a way of persuading the agency to reach an agreement with Mr. Zuckerman. The administration backed down immediately in the face of criticism over the proposal.

CORRECTION-DATE: June 3, 1994, Friday

 CORRECTION:
A chart yesterday describing details of the proposed sale of the New York Coliseum to Mortimer B. Zuckerman gave an incorrect deadline for the signing of a letter of intent, a document that indicates that all sides agree to the transaction. The date is July 15, 1994, not July 15, 1995. Because of an editing error, the article also misstated the location of the site. It is at 59th Street and Columbus Circle, not Columbus Avenue.


GRAPHIC: The money: Mortimer B. Zuckerman and his company, Boston Properties, will pay $80 million to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority for the site. New York City will contribute an additional $20 million. Boston Properties will put up a $17 million nonrefundable down payment. The developer will pay the estimated $2.5 million cost of separating the Coliseum office building form exhibition hall, $6 million to restore Coliseum garage and $2.5 million for subway improvements.
Chart: "AT A GLANCE: Key Terms of the New Coliseum Deal"
 The deadlines: Letter of intent must be signed by July 15,1995; a lease with a tenant for 500,000 square feet signed by April 15, 1995, construction financing and final closing by April 30, 1995. Failure to start construction of office building within one year of closing will result in a penalty payment of $1 million per month.
 The lawsuits: The developer will dismiss all claims and lawsuits and will post a $2 million letter of credit, which the transit agency may cash in the event that the developer brings frivolous litigation.

Map/Diagram: "DEVELOPMENT: Future of the Coliseum"
 
1985: Mortimer B. Zuckerman agrees to build a 2.9 million square foot project at Columbus Circle on the site of the Coliseum, owned by Metropolitan Transportation Authority, that would include housing and retail space.
 
1988: Mr. Zuckerman, scales down the plan with shorter, narrower towers that would include 500,000 square feet less than the original proposal.
 
1989: A redesign of the project leads to a contract between the transit authority and Mr. Zuckerman that calls for 2.1 million square feet of space.
 
1993: On Nov. 30, Mr. Zuckerman submits a proposal that cuts the space to one million square feet and preserves the existing office buildign. The exhibition hall would be demolished.

HEADLINE: Clinton, in Rome, Starts Tour of Europe to Burnish Image

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ROME, Thursday, June 2

 BODY:
Bill Clinton began the second major European trip of his Presidency today in much the same way he began the first, still struggling to convince the principal allies of the United States that he is a worthy leader of the world's only fully functioning superpower.
Air Force One landed at Ciampino Airport, southeast of Rome, a few minutes after midnight, and Mr. Clinton will plunge into a characteristically ambitious program this morning. 
 The centerpiece of the eight-day journey will be the 50th anniversary of the epic amphibious landing in Normandy, France, on June 6, 1944, by British, Canadian and American forces, for which commemorative events worthy of Cecil B. de Mille have been planned. He will also mark the capture of Rome by Allied armies two days earlier.
There will also be substantive discussions along the way with Italian, British and French leaders and with Pope John II, who left the hospital only a few days ago after surgery for a broken thigh.
 
About Clinton the Man
 If the official agendas focus on matters of high policy like the slaughter in Rwanda, strife in Bosnia and nuclear weapons in North Korea, a more personal question will preoccupy many of the Europeans: will Mr. Clinton, who was elected on a promise to pay more attention to domestic policy and less to foreign affairs, grasp the baton of international leadership like every President since Franklin D. Roosevelt, or does he represent a reversion to a more inward-looking America?
At home, the President's advisers believe, there will inevitably be comparisons to Ronald Reagan, who shone so brightly on the Normandy stage 10 years ago.
But in Europe, it is the future that preoccupies the politicians and policy analysts. Over the weekend, European newspapers made much of Mr. Clinton's acknowledgment of the "relentless criticism" of his foreign policies, and of his pledge to begin "changing whatever it is that is not inspiring people's confidence in me."
From the European perspective, what is missing is a clear Presidential definition of the national interests of the United States and what he will do to protect them.
 
Twinges of Nostalgia
 "When he came to Europe last summer," one foreign minister said this week, "he said all the right things. But since then the sounds coming out of Washington have not been reassuring. Instead of decisive leadership, we have seen confusion, contradiction and delay."
A senior civil servant conceded that "there is a considerable nostalgia for the good old days of Kissinger, Eagleburger, Scowcroft and Baker" -- the mainstays of the foreign-affairs teams of recent Republican Administrations.
Many recognize that there are no easy answers to Rwanda or Bosnia on either side of the Atlantic. But even a generally sympathetic commentary like that today in The Independent in London said "Washington has been its own worst enemy" in its dizzying inconsistency on issues like Haiti.
However much Mr. Clinton is able to counter such impressions, his sternest test will come on D-Day at Pointe du Hoc, the cliff commanding the American invasion beaches that was scaled by a brave and audacious Ranger force. On that spot 10 years ago, Mr. Reagan -- one of the great masters of American political theater -- staged a boffo performance that was repeated, on tape, through his 1984 re-election campaign.
 
Tough Act to FollowThe Generation Gap<that's the blurb
 It will not be easy for Mr. Clinton to match Mr. Reagan, and the President knows it.
Not only was Mr. Reagan's whole political personality perfect for the part; he was the right age, too, a member of the World War II generation well situated to remind his countrymen of the heroism of Normandy, even if he himself spent the war years making training films on a Hollywood sound stage.
Mr. Clinton, by contrast, was born the year after the global conflict ended. When war confronted his generation, in Vietnam, he managed to avoid service, and he wrote to his draft board from Oxford University that he loathed the military.
As President, he has had rocky relations with the military, and although 30,000 veterans and their families are expected in Normandy, many others have said they would pass them up because of their antipathy toward Mr. Clinton's views.
To soften the comparison between Mr. Clinton's wartime sojourn amid the dreamy spires of Oxford and the bloody experience of young men on the beaches of northern France, Mr. Clinton decided not to receive an honorary degree from Oxford during his time in England on June 4 and 5. Instead, he will stop there on his way home from Paris on June 8, after the festivities are over.
Characteristically, the President plans to try to turn the disadvantage of his nonmilitary background into an asset. His purpose, a member of his staff said last month, will be to convince members of his generation and those younger than he how much they owe to their parents and grandparents and their battlefield sacrifices.
Before leaving Washington on Wednesday for Rome, the President sought to set out his theme, stopping at the 1st Infantry Division monument just outside the White House grounds and quoting the outfit's motto, "No mission too difficult, no sacrifice too great, duty first."
The Big Red One, as the division is known, was one of two that hit Omaha Beach, where the fighting was fiercest, in the early hours of D-Day. (The other was the 29th Infantry Division.) It was also the first into France during World War I, one of the first into Vietnam and the first to breach Iraqi defenses during the gulf war.
 
The Strength of Allies
 Mr. Clinton pointed to the partnerships between the United States, Britain and other nations in World War II as the model for those who seek a more democratic world after the cold war. Urging patience, he borrowed a line from F.D.R.: "Our successes will not come with rushing speed, but we must see our battles to the end."
"Fifty years ago on this day and at this hour," he said, "the men and women of America saved democracy in Europe and changed the course of history for the world. Wherever you are then, I hope you will have some time to look at the ceremonies. I hope you will think about how we will honor their legacy by carrying it on. That is the greatest honor of all."
Once he reaches Normandy and his every word and action are broadcast to the world, Mr. Clinton will have the chance to prove he can play the visionary.
The Presidency is really two jobs wrapped in one. He has excelled, especially on the domestic side, when concentrating on politics and policy -- the prime ministerial role, in the old European model. But so far, unlike Mr. Reagan and John F. Kennedy, he has had trouble playing the unifying, uplifting role that was once played by the crowned heads of Europe.
 
A Diligent Student
 Mr. Clinton has risen to such challenges before, winning plaudits where some had expected failure. He did it on his first trip to Europe and his first economic summit conference, at his first big meeting with Russian leaders and at his pioneering Pacific Rim summit conference in Seattle.
For this trip, he has made unusually thoroughly preparations, undertaking an extensive reading program and asking a group of veterans and historians to give him a detailed briefing last week. To a man, they were impressed by the seriousness of Mr. Clinton's purpose.
"I was struck by his modesty, honesty and simplicity," said Paul Fussell, the author of "The Great War and Modern Memory" (Oxford University Press). "He knows nothing about war and he knows he ought to know what was happening in Normandy. He kept saying, 'God, I'm learning a lot from you.' "
But many a political land mine awaits the President, starting today.
He will meet the new Italian Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi, whose Government includes neo-Fascist ministers, and he will have a private session with the Pope. Vatican officials have promised that the Pope will challenge the Administration's push for abortion rights in international population-control programs.

HEADLINE: WHITE HOUSE ASKS GLOBAL SANCTIONS ON NORTH KOREANS

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 2

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration called today for global economic sanctions against North Korea after international inspectors said the North Koreans had destroyed evidence of whether they had diverted material for a nuclear bomb.
The Administration's move marked a new -- and potentially dangerous -- phase of Washington's confrontation with North Korea over its nuclear program. North Korea has threatened to attack South Korea if sanctions are imposed. 
 Washington's decision to seek the sanctions follows more than a year of on-again, off-again talks in which American officials have sought to coax North Korea to agree to strict controls on its nuclear program.
"They have triggered this, not the United States or anyone else," President Clinton told reporters in Rome today. "I just don't think we can walk away from this."
But even as the Administration vowed to seek sanctions, key elements of its plan remained unclear, including whether China would go along and what steps North Korea would have to take to end any sanctions that might be imposed.
Administration officials said the sanctions needed to be painful enough to induce the North Koreans to reconsider the decision to proceed with their nuclear weapons program while leaving open the possibility of a diplomatic solution.
An Administration official, who asked not to be identified, said one plan that has been promoted by Robert Gallucci, the Administration's top official on policy toward North Korea, has two main elements: calling on other countries to refrain from arms purchases or deliveries, and seeking a cut-off in the $600 million to $1.6 billion in annual remittances sent back to the country by North Koreans living in Japan.
Other possible measures include suspending North Korea's membership in international organizations, cutting off technical assistance and banning non-commercial airline flights. The most Draconian measure would be a full-scale trade embargo, which would ban oil shipments. But the general view among officials is that such a measure would go beyond what China and other Asian countries are willing to accept.
Senior Administration officials declined to explain their sanctions plan, saying that Mr. Gallucci planned to discuss the proposed measures with South Korean and Japanese officials on Friday. One official said, however, that Washington was still in the process of hammering out its position.
China's position is important because it wields a veto in the United Nations Security Council, supplies oil and food to North Korea and has a long border with North Korea. Although the Administration has sought to justify its decision to award most-favored-nation trading status to China by saying Beijing's cooperation is needed in dealing with North Korea, it is still unclear whether China in fact would support sanctions.
In Beijing today, China warned against increasing the confrontation with North Korea. "At this time, we do not favor the resort to means that might sharpen the confrontation," said Shen Guofang, Foreign Ministry spokesman, in a news conference.
Russia also urged the Administration to move slowly. In Moscow, President Boris N. Yeltsin said a Russian-proposed international conference should be convened before sanctions are imposed.
"Today, when no decision has been taken on calling an international conference, it is too early to talk about sanctions," Mr. Yeltsin said.
But Administration officials said that Russia is much less of an obstacle to sanctions than China and that Russian diplomats at the United Nations have been generally cooperative on the question.
 
Other Options Exist
 Even if the Security Council refused to support sanctions, there are some measures that Washington and its allies could take on their own, such as persuading Japan to cut off financial transfers.
North Korea's threats to retaliate if sanctions are imposed are another worry. Echoing its bellicose warnings that sanctions could be an act of war, the North Korean Foreign Minister, Kim Yong Nam, sent a letter on Saturday to the United Nations Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, warning that sanctions would "bring devastating consequences, menacing peace in Asia and the rest of the world."
The Pentagon said today that there were no indications that North Korea, which has concentrated much of its 1.2 million-member military close to South Korea, was about to attack. As a precaution, the Pentagon has already shipped Patriot antimissile systems and additional spare parts and other supplies to the area.
American military officials said the aircraft carrier Independence would leave Japan on Friday for a major exercise near Hawaii. Because of the heightened tensions, military officials were thinking about keeping the Independence west of Midway Island so that it could steam toward Korea if a crisis developed.
Another way the North Koreans could retaliate is by withdrawing from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and rejecting all constraints on its nuclear program. Despite its dispute with the International Atomic Energy Agency, North Korea has continued to allow monitors to visit its nuclear site to determine that it is not being used to build up a nuclear arsenal.
At issue is North Korea's refusal to permit international inspectors to examine 300 of the 8,000 fuel rods in its nuclear reactor in order to determine how much plutonium might have diverted in past years.
The Central Intelligence Agency has concluded that North Korea diverted enough plutonium for one or two bombs after it shut down its nuclear reactor in 1989 and that there is a "better than even" chance it has actually developed one or two nuclear weapons.
North Korea has denied this. But in recent weeks the North Koreans began furiously pulling out fuel rods from the reactor at Yongbyon and dumping them indiscriminately into a cooling pond.
Today, Hans Blix, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, sent a letter to Mr. Boutros-Ghali noting that the North Koreans had removed so many rods that they had made it impossible for the agency to conduct its measurements.
 
Need for Cooperation
 Mr. Blix wrote that the agency's ability to determine whether plutonium was diverted "has been seriously eroded because of the discharge of the core."
"The situation resulting from the core discharge is irreversible," Mr. Blix added.
But Mr. Blix also suggested that there were other ways for the agency to reconstruct the history of the reactor and to try to determine whether plutonium had been diverted.
"For the agency to be able to verify non-diversion" by the North Koreans, Mr. Blix wrote, "it is essential for the agency to have access to all safeguards, relevant information and locations. To achieve that, a paramount requirement is the full cooperation" of North Korea.
One way of gaining additional information would be to send inspectors to two nuclear waste sites at Yongbyon. But the North Koreans have steadfastly refused to give international monitors access to the sites.
Mr. Blix is traveling to the United Nations to meet with the Security Council on Friday, United Nations officials said.
With North Korea rejecting Washington's earlier conciliatory overture, the matter has become a hot issue for Mr. Clinton, who is being criticized for what some say is a vacillating foreign policy.
Some American officials say the Administration was obliged to seek sanctions to maintain its credibility. But a comprehensive analysis prepared by American intelligence agencies last year said it was unlikely that sanctions would induce North Korea to abandon its nuclear program.
 
Building Second Reactor
 North Korea has been working hard to construct a second, larger reactor and to expand its ability to reprocess plutonium. The fuel that it is now being removed from its reactor is enough to build four or five bombs.
North Korea's population is inured to economic deprivation. Some trading partners that provide oil for arms, like Iran, are unlikely to be swayed by a United Nations call to action.
A key question is what exactly the Administration hopes to achieve through sanctions. If they were imposed, would North Korea have to help the atomic energy agency determine whether plutonium had been diverted to get them lifted? Would it need to do more, such as halting the construction of its second reactor and the expansion of its nuclear reprocessing ability?
Would the Security Council agree to a gradual toughening of sanctions and, if so, over what time frame?
"The objective is to have North Korea reconsider its position and find it in its interest to move back to negotiations and settle this matter," a senior Administration official said.

HEADLINE: Haitian Migrants Settle In, Looking Back

BYLINE: By DEBORAH SONTAG 

 BODY:
In a turquoise cottage in Miami's Little Haiti, Meriente Auguste riffled through photographs of the family left behind when she fled home on a tumbledown boat. She pulled out two snapshots, one of her father, one of her teen-age sister. Hands crossed over their chests, they both lay in open coffins.
"They died because of me," said Ms. Auguste, 23, who left Haiti in 1991, won political asylum last fall and now irons blouses for a living. "My father was shot because I escaped, and my sister died of sorrow the day of his funeral." 
 Two thousand miles north and a universe away, Patricia Reiher Francis conducted business in four languages in La Petite Boutique, her bookstore in Cambria Heights, Queens. In 1958, after her wealthy father angered President Francois Duvalier, her family gave up their butler, their cook and the rest of their elite island life. They took not a leaky boat, but an airplane into exile. It was the very beginning of the Haitian exodus.
Between the flight of Ms. Francis and that of Ms. Auguste lies the story of the Haitian Diaspora. Spanning nearly four decades, it is a complex tale often distorted by the monolithic image of the Haitian boat people.
That image -- of poor, illiterate, disease-carrying people -- has lent an animus to the debate over Haitian refugees that many Haitian-Americans find unsettling. The debate gained new urgency this week when Jamaica agreed to let the United States conduct shipboard immigration interviews in its waters, raising the prospect of another wave of refugees.
"It's insulting to be so unwanted; all this talk about Haitians descending on this country as if they were a plague," said Roger Biamby, director of human services at the Pierre Toussaint Haitian-Catholic Center in Miami. "It's not like we haven't proved ourselves."
Numbering about 450,000, Haitian-Americans are a small, entrenched immigrant group, concentrated in the New York and Miami metropolitan areas. They include not only migrant workers in Homestead, Fla., but wealthy doctors on Long Island, not only taxi drivers in Manhattan but college professors in Washington. Most came by plane.
Four in 10 have at least some college education; one in 10 has less than an eighth-grade education. About 5.7 percent of the nation's Haitian households -- 5,300 -- collect welfare benefits, compared with 5.2 percent of households generally, according to an analysis of 1990 Census data.
Marc Abraham, an elfin 37-year-old Long Island resident, is far more representative than the gaunt refugees who beseech Sister Ruth Podesta for rice and beans in Miami. The son of a carpenter and a hotel maid, Mr. Abraham teaches math at Erasmus Hall High School in Flatbush, Brooklyn, and moonlights at La Guardia Community College. He also runs a typically hodgepodge immigrant business, a car service that sells commercial insurance and produces educational videos in Haitian Creole.
 
Plenty of Problems
 "I think Americans see Haitians as a desperate people instead of a decent people who struggle," Mr. Abraham said. "I have to understand that hostility, I guess, to take it off my heart. I mean, this country has enough problems without ours too."
Indeed, the most recent Haitian refugees have faced their share of problems -- high unemployment and rampant crime in Little Haiti -- as have second-generation Haitian-Americans in New York City who cannot find their way out of the ghetto.
"My feeling is that there is coming to be a bifurcation in the community," said Alex Stepick, director of the Immigration and Ethnicity Institute at Florida International University. "There are those living out the American immigrant dream and those who, succumbing to anti-Haitian and racist prejudice, are merging into the underclass."
 
The Diaspora
To Flatbush And Beyond
 Every wave of migration from Haiti has come during political turmoil there, but economic malaise always accompanies such turmoil. So it is often difficult to distinguish political from economic migrants. .
Some Haitian emigres went to Harlem in the 1920's. But the migration from Haiti started in earnest when Francois Duvalier took power in 1957. The first Haitians to leave were dissident politicians, and then came middle-class professionals and finally tradespeople. Like other immigrants before them, most headed for New York City.
They confronted what Michel Laguerre, a Haitian-American anthropologist, calls their "triple minority status," as blacks, foreigners and non-English speakers. Coming from the elite of a black nation, it was a rude shock for people like Mr. Biamby's father, Ernst, a former army colonel.
Colonel Biamby fled after plotting and failing to assassinate Duvalier. A career military officer with no experience in the civilian world, he took a job stabbing litter at the 1964 World's Fair in Queens. His wife sewed in a garment factory. His son, then 16, washed dishes at a Times Square restaurant, eventually putting himself through a doctoral program in political science.
 
Newspapers and Radio
 Thousands of Haitians were working their way out of menial jobs at the same time. They started newspapers and radio programs, churches, credit associations and social clubs. They established a quiet presence in Brooklyn that remains to this day, with the latest arrivals selling cloves and djondjon, or dried mushrooms, on Church Avenue.
Most Haitians settled first in Flatbush, Crown Heights and Bedford-Stuyvesant, working in garment factories, hotels and restaurants. But those who could moved to Queens and the suburbs, commuting to hospital emergency rooms and law practices in Brooklyn for work. . As their children grew, they became fluent in the lexicon of New York, in the P.S.'s and the IRT.
Estelle Dubuission, 64, like many, never stopped missing her hometown, Lascahobas. In fact, she mortgaged her home in Canarsie, spent the limits on her credit cards and organized fund-raising events to give the town an ambulance and a child-care center. Her children, meanwhile, grew up to become an electrical engineer, an architect and an X-ray technician.
"They were born and raised here," she said. "They are crazy about Haiti, but this is their home."
 
Miami Connection
Under the Palms, The Roots Remain
 Until 1977, Brooklyn was the quiet heart of Haitian America. Between 1977 and 1981, 60,000 Haitian boat people landed in South Florida. And just like that, the nerve center of the Haitian Diaspora moved south, to a community of stucco cottages and mom-and-pop businesses anointed Little Haiti.
From its birth, Miami's Haitian community was different. Haitians had melted into New York's black neighborhoods, into the vastness of the city. But in Miami, their presence was felt immediately. Their arrival was controversial, their numbers greater relative to the total population. They were younger and poorer. And they remained so tied to their homeland that the ins and outs of Haitian politics quickly became a local story on Miami's television newscasts.
"In New York you can forget for a few minutes that you were born in Haiti and get on with your life," said Alwyn McCalla, 32, who runs a money-transfer office in Little Haiti. "But in Miami, forget about it. You live, breathe and eat your Haitian roots."
In the early 1980's, thousands of Haitian doctors, teachers, social workers and entrepreneurs moved from New York to Miami. Restaurants serving conch and goat and record shops blaring Haitian merengue sprang up on 54th Street and Northeast Second Avenue. Before long, there was a 24-hour Creole-language radio station.
 
Prejudice in Miami
 By the 1990 Census, Haitians represented about 6 percent of the city's population, concentrated in Little Haiti. They were only 1.5 percent of New York City, spread throughout the five boroughs. Miami's Haitians were more provincial and less educated than New York's; nearly half had less than an eighth-grade education.
In Miami, "the anti-Haitian prejudice was much stronger," Professor Stepick said.
When he moved from New York, Leslie Prudent, an assistant elementary school principal, was startled by the antipathy. Students told him to "go back to the banana boat." Teachers referred to problem students as "Haitians" regardless of background. Tennis players dropped their jaws when they watched Mr. Prudent, a former tennis coach at Hunter College, destroy his opponents on the court.
"They'd be in shock, like, 'I didn't know the boat people played,' " Mr. Prudent said.
Much of the antagonism sprang from the way the Miami Haitians arrived, some literally washing up on beaches. The tension was increased by the Federal Government's effort to keep out more. In 1981, President Reagan ordered Coast Guard cutters to stop Haitians at sea. In the next 10 years, only 28 of the 22,716 intercepted were admitted into the United States.
 
Jailed if Caught
 Those who made it through the blockade were usually jailed if caught. Cuban refugees, in contrast, were welcomed as heroes. The Haitians felt embattled, and it did not help that some Miami blacks resented their entrepreneurial success and their appeal to employers as eager workers accepting low pay for long hours.
"Every day I get calls saying, 'Fedy, we need some Haitians,' " said Fedy Bieux-Brierre, administrator of a City of Miami office in Little Haiti. "The Haitian workers don't look at the clock."
While tensions existed between black Americans and West Indians in New York -- Haitians used to be called "French fries" in Harlem -- the antagonism was closer to the surface in Miami.
"I'll never forget the time I met this Afro-American in the supermarket," Mr. Prudent said. "He heard my accent and said, 'You're not a brother. You're a cousin.' "
 
Trouble Time
Frustrations And Failures
 By the second generation, when the accents fade, however, Haitian-Americans are, for all intents and purposes, black Americans, as acknowledged by the black leaders who champion their cause on a national level.
They face the same hurdles. And some evidence suggests that the adult children of Haitian immigrants are floundering.
In New York, only about 7 percent of Haitian-born immigrants collect welfare benefits, compared with 9 percent of the general population. But, in contrast, at least a quarter of adult, second-generation Haitians receive welfare, according to an analysis of the 1990 Census. That, however, is a small number: only about 1,000 household heads.
 
Sharing Resources
 Haitian immigrants, who do not believe in welfare, consider this a negative example of Americanization. In Haiti, families, even people from the same town, are supposed to share their resources. "It's a Creole saying: 'If there is food for two, there's food for three,' " said Chantal Morrisse, a hotel maid.
Still, while some Haitian-Americans have derailed their parents' dreams, some have realized them. About half the Haitians in New York have some college education, and 4 percent have advanced degrees. About a third of New York's Haitians now live in the suburbs, particularly Long Island, Rockland County, and in northern New Jersey.
The Haitian Enterprise Association in New York counts several thousand Haitian-owned businesses. Haitian Doctors Abroad, which gathered 500 physicians for a convention in Orlando, Fla., last year, counts several thousand medical doctors.
 
Recent Troubles
 From the beginning, Little Haiti in Miami was a healthy, bustling neighborhood. There are no empty storefronts, and no homeless people on the streets. But lately it has known some troubles.
Most recently, with many businesses dependent on trade with Haiti, its commercial vibrancy has been dimmed by the international embargo against Haiti's military regime. Unemployment is high, about 30 percent. Once a safe neighborhood, Little Haiti now has the highest crime rate in Miami.
Ms. Auguste, however, still finds it peaceful.
As a teen-ager in Haiti, Ms. Auguste, daughter of a tailor, helped run a literacy program. Infuriated by soldiers who disrupted classes, she threw herself into politics with a fervent belief that President Jean-Bertrand Aristide was Haiti's savior. Shortly after he was overthrown, Ms. Auguste was jailed, then fled. Her father was murdered by thugs in retribution, she said.
 
A Pink Toyota
 Accepting her story, the United States allowed Ms. Auguste to start a new life. Now she commutes every morning to a garment factory in Hialeah, where she earns about $200 a week. Working overtime, she has saved enough money to make her first big purchase: a pale pink, used Toyota Tercel with a big red heart on the front bumper. She has every intention of returning to Haiti as soon as it is safer there, she said.
But so did many other Haitians, political exiles and economic migrants alike, who fled before her. They ended up forming the Diaspora, with roots now too deep to be unearthed.
"Sometimes I have a desire to go back, but there's nothing to go back to," said Rodrigue Charles, 35, an immigration agent and former Peace Corps volunteer in Africa. "All the Haitians I grew up with are either in Canada, France or the U.S."

Graph: "DEMOGRAPHICS: Haitians in the U.S."
 Haitian-Americans believe they number about one million. But the 1990 Census found 306,000 people of Haitian origin residing in the country. Some demographers, however, say that the Haitian population is undercounted by the Census and comes closer to 450,000. Graphs track the number of Haitians immigrating to the U.S. from 1950 through 1990; show breakdowns of the education accomplishments of Haitians in New York City and southeast Florida; and list data on public assistance for Haitians in the U.S., southeast Florida, and the New York City area.

HEADLINE: CUOMO, BEGINNING BID FOR 4TH TERM, ASSAILS THE G.O.P.

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BUFFALO, June 2

 BODY:
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo kicked off his campaign for a fourth four-year term today with a speech that included a list of accomplishments, an acknowledgement that he had not reached all his goals, and a broad attack on Republicans, both in New York and elsewhere, for practicing the politics of division.
On the closing day of the State Democratic Convention, Mr. Cuomo and his running mate, Lieut. Gov. Stan Lundine, left the direct assaults on their probable Republican opponents, State Senator George E. Pataki and Elizabeth P. McCaughey, to a parade of surrogates. When it was Mr. Cuomo's turn, he used his meandering 50-minute acceptance speech to draw numerous substantive and political distinctions between the Democratic and Republican tickets. 
 "Stan and I are different because we weren't picked by some boss," he said, referring to Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, who played a major role in assembling the Republican ticket. "Let me tell you something. I may hit a sour note from time to time. But understand this. The words and ideas that come out of my mouth are mine. No one else's. I will have no boss but the people of the state of New York."
That theme echoed throughout the convention, where the Democrats nominated a ticket heavy with incumbents and outlined a strategy for what is expected to be Mr. Cuomo's toughest campaign since his first, in 1982. They made clear that they would not let Mr. Pataki, an unknown quantity in most of the state, define himself alone. But the intensity of their attacks suggested the concern Democratic strategists have about Mr. Cuomo's prospects this year.
Today's speakers took every opportunity to depict Mr. Pataki as a political creation of Mr. D'Amato. They characterized him as a man of malleable convictions who had made a career out of opposing initiatives rather than proposing solutions.
The chairman of the Democratic National Committee, David Wilhelm, referred to him as "D'Amato light." New York City's Public Advocate, Mark Green, asked, "Are we going to let Al's pals run the state?"
While Mr. Cuomo did not acknowledge Mr. Pataki by name, he painted the campaign as a struggle between positivism and negativism. "Where would I be, Mario Cuomo, if the negativists who mocked my parents and called them dagos had been in charge of the state of New York or any other important government?" he asked.
He also sought to link New York's Republicans to the national party's caustic 1992 convention in Houston and Republican leaders' past efforts to portray New York as a pariah of liberal politics. "I believe we Democrats seem today to know this state better, to appreciate it more, to love it more than our opponents," he said. "Maybe it is the negativism that has infected our adversaries."
Mr. Cuomo clearly viewed today's address as critical to his re-election. He rehearsed twice in the Buffalo Convention Center to become comfortable with the Teleprompter. To make sure he was rested, he stayed overnight at a Buffalo airport hotel, breaking his practice of sleeping in the Executive Mansion in Albany whenever possible. And his aides made sure the convention hall was packed with 3,000 placard-waving fans, a stark contrast to the half-empty hall on Wednesday.
With the exception of Mr. Lundine, who was nominated without opposition today, the rest of the Democratic ticket was put together on Wednesday. It includes United States Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Attorney General G. Oliver Koppell and State Comptroller H. Carl McCall.
Mr. McCall used his acceptance speech today to level a direct attack on his Republican opponent, Herbert London, the 1990 Conservative Party nominee for governor. After losing to Mr. Pataki in the gubernatorial balloting at last week's Republican convention, Mr. London accepted the party's nomination as comptroller in an arrangement aimed at winning Conservative support for Mr. Pataki.
"Herb London doesn't want to be comptroller," said Mr. McCall, who hopes to become the first black candidate to win statewide office in New York. "He wants to use it to advance his far, far-right-wing agenda."
 
No Woman on Ticket
 Heading into the Sept. 13 primary, the Democratic ticket remains without a woman while the Republican ticket has two -- Ms. McCaughey and Bernadette Castro, who is running for Senate. Mr. Cuomo seemed to acknowledge that contrast in his speech today by listing virtually every woman he had appointed to office.
One Democratic woman, Karen S. Burstein, a former Family Court judge in Brooklyn, plans to try to run a primary campaign against Mr. Koppell, as does the Brooklyn District Attorney, Charles J. Hynes. To get on the ballot, they must collect 15,000 valid signatures on nominating petitions during a five-week period this summer. The Rev. Al Sharpton also will go the petition route in an attempt to challenge Mr. Moynihan.
On the Republican side, Mr. Pataki still may face a primary challenge from Richard M. Rosenbaum, a former state Republican chairman. And some Conservative Party leaders hope to keep Mr. Pataki from receiving their party's endorsement at its convention in Albany on Saturday, a move that would tarnish the gloss of Republican-Conservative unity created at the Republican convention.
Mr. Cuomo begins the campaign with more than $4.5 million, far more than Mr. Pataki. Mr. Wilhelm pledged today to give the State Democratic Committee $1 million from a June 27 Democratic National Committee fund-raiser in Manhattan that will feature President Clinton.
 
Formidable Obstacles
 But even the Democratic delegates and strategists here acknowledged that Mr. Cuomo faces formidable obstacles. A restless electorate demonstrated its impatience last year by ousting incumbent Democratic chief executives in New Jersey and New York City. And after a bruising recession, Mr. Cuomo's approval rating rests near its lowest point.
The Governor and his advisers maintain that he has an admirable record but has failed to sell it. He catalogued his accomplishments, ranging from a large personal income tax cut to the country's first mandatory seat-belt law to significant increases in funds for education.
"The speech was lengthy because it began the process of communicating a substantial series of accomplishments that have lost their immediacy," said the New York City Comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi.
Mr. Cuomo's media consultant, David Garth, agreed, saying that even he had been surprised to learn what the Governor had done. He blamed the news media for not fully reporting the Cuomo record. "The people who report the media don't stop at the rest stations on the state highway because if they did, they'd tell you that 22 of the 26 of the Thruway restaurants and stops have been rebuilt," he said. "It boggles the mind."

HEADLINE: School Chiefs Say Teachers Face Layoffs

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON 

 BODY:
Superintendents in New York City's 32 school districts say they will be forced to lay off hundreds of teachers under the Giuliani administration's proposed city budget.
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has said the budget cuts he proposed for the Board of Education would cut bureaucratic fat without directly affecting classrooms. But several superintendents, who have been meeting in recent weeks to discuss the cuts, said they could not balance their budgets without dismissing teachers, assistant principals, guidance counselors, teacher's aides and others. 
 The superintendents say that the damage that the budget cuts would do has been overshadowed in the last two months by the Mayor's dispute with Schools Chancellor Ramon C. Cortines over the size of the school bureaucracy. That exchange became so heated that the Chancellor threatened to resign, but ultimately he agreed to the Mayor's demand that 2,500 jobs be cut at school headquarters. Several, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they felt the Chancellor had failed to properly highlight the losses in classrooms.
In interviews they said the $358 million in cuts planned for the $7.5 billion budget would be the deepest in several years.
"The Mayor has said, 'Cut $358 million from the schools without hurting children,' " said Dr. Arthur Greenberg, superintendent of District 25 in Queens. "And I want to tell you that that is just not possible."
The superintendents, joined by members of community school boards, school union officials and educational advocates, have begun preparing protests, letter-writing drives and phone campaigns to persuade the City Council to restore some of the money when it votes on the budget.
Mr. Giuliani's aides and officials at the Financial Control Board, speaking in interviews yesterday, said the superintendents were attempting to exaggerate the severity of the cuts and said the projections of mass layoffs were alarmist.
"We've heard the Board of Ed cry wolf on a number of occasions," said Abraham M. Lackman, the city budget director. "It's not unusual that as the City Council considers the budget, that the Board of Education will seek to protect its spending."
The Board of Education's central budget office recently sent a memo to the superintendents that outlined two potential budgets, one that projected cuts of $100 million and one with cuts of $200 million. The memo apportioned the cuts by enrollment in each district and asked the superintendents how they would accommodate the two possibilities.
By yesterday, only 24 of the 32 superintendents had responded, but even their partial reports underlined the scope of the cutbacks contemplated. Under the $100 million cut, the 24 superintendents said they would lay off 368 classroom teachers, 87 assistant principals, and 1,200 guidance counselors, classroom aides and other employees. Under the $200 million cut, the 24 superintendents said they would lay off 837 teachers, 183 assistant principals, and 2,250 other school employees.
"The Mayor's goal was not to have any cuts in the classrooms, and the Chancellor has agreed," said Marcelino Rodriguez, superintendent in Manhattan's District 4, which includes East Harlem. "But a cut of this size is going to hit classrooms anyway."
The 32 superintendents administer the city's 830 elementary and middle schools; similar cuts were likely in the 160 high schools, school officials said.
Mr. Giuliani's budget was presented May 10 to the City Council. The Council plans to vote on it late next week, said Thomas L. McMahon, director of the Council's finance division. Unlike other large school systems around the country, the New York City schools are not fiscally independent: state aid and city financing come through City Hall.
Mr. McMahon said that the magnitude of the cuts being asked of the school system this year surpasses any of the five previous budgets that he has worked on since he assumed his position in 1989, especially since more than 20,000 new students enter the system each year.
"Given the register growth, which drives a whole series of new needs, these cuts are more dramatic," he said.
 
Cortines Criticized
 Several superintendents said Mr. Cortines has appeared unwilling to confront the Mayor since his public disagreement with Mr. Giuliani on April 9 over cuts to the bureaucracy and the appointment of a City Hall-based fiscal monitor. Mr. Cortines remained in his job only after intervention by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo.
The Chancellor's spokesman, John Beckman, disputed the view of these superintendents. "If anything, the Chancellor has been the lone voice about the effect of the proposed cuts on the schools," Mr. Beckman said. "What is needed is a bigger chorus."
Because simultaneous negotiations are underway at City Hall and in Albany, where the Legislature has not yet determined how much state aid New York City will receive, few numbers in the debate are firm.
Anxious over the continuing uncertainties, the superintendents and many community school board presidents met on May 16 with Mr. Cortines, Carol A. Gresser, the board president, and Leonard Hellenbrand, the board's budget director, requesting information about the cuts they should expect.
 
Budgets Explained
 Three days later, Mr. Hellenbrand sent the memo projecting the two budget scenarios.
Explaining how he arrived at the two scenarios, Mr. Hellenbrand said that Mr. Cortines had already identified about $60 million to $70 million in administrative cuts at board headquarters. Through further economy moves, accounting devices, and negotiation with City Hall, Mr. Hellenbrand said he believed the board could reduce the cuts necessary at the community district level to $200 million, hence the first scenario. City Hall is likely to pass on to the schools about $100 million in state education aid, Mr. Hellenbrand said, and for that reason, he asked the superintendents to explain how they would respond to budget cuts of $100 million.
The superintendents' tactics for accommodating the $100 million cut would vary considerably. Superintendent Anthony Alvarado said he would accommodate the $2.2 million cut that the $100 million citywide reduction would bring in his District 2, which includes most of lower Manhattan, by laying off five assistant principals, seven district office employees, four guidance counselors, 56 school aides and 13 teachers.
Superintendent William Casey said that the $100 million cut would mean a $2.1 million loss to Brooklyn's District 15, which includes the Park Slope and Sunset Park sections. He said that, in order to avoid increasing class sizes, he would eliminate 30 assistant principals, 19 guidance counselors, 33 secretaries, 123 school aides and 15 school guards.
"The Board of Education, more than any other agency, is extremely adept at creating artifice," said Allen J. Proctor, the executive director of the Financial Control Board. "You're seeing a familiar part of the budget choreography."

HEADLINE: Doubting Sanctions, Aristide Urges U.S. Action on Haiti

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 2

 BODY:
In the strongest statement he has made in favor of military intervention, the exiled Haitian President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, said today that he doubted that economic sanctions could restore him to office and urged "action to get rid of the thugs" who overthrew him.
In an interview in his Washington apartment, Father Aristide repeated his concern that the Haitian Constitution would not allow him to formally invite foreign military intervention. But the Haitian leader said the United States should be "moving toward a surgical action" to remove Haiti's military leadership that he said would succeed in a few hours. 
 Asked if sanctions could force the military to relinquish power, Father Aristide said, "If we really want to save lives, something else should be done now." Referring to the United States intervention in Panama in 1989 to remove the military dictator Manuel Noriega, he added: "Haiti is not the first case. When things were like that in another country, something was done. Why not in Haiti?"
Father Aristide's comments came as part of a growing debate in the United States over statements by President Clinton that military action should not be ruled out to force an end to Haiti's political crisis.
 
Taken by Surprise?
 But his statements appeared to take some advisers by surprise. Moments before the Haitian leader spoke in the interview, one close American adviser, Burton Wides, suggested that the emphasis on the diplomacy around Haiti should be aggressively closing loopholes in the international sanctions before any foreign intervention is considered. It was not clear whether the Haitian leader had expressed his views on military action directly to Clinton Administration officials.
Until now, Father Aristide's position on foreign intervention has been widely perceived as ambivalent, with many in the Clinton Administration expressing concern that he would either not fully support military intervention before the fact, or would quickly condemn it once he was returned to office.
But while he endorsed the idea of foreign military action, Father Aristide, who was overthrown in a coup in September 1991, expressed strong opposition to any plan that would involve any long-term foreign occupation.
The debate over United States intervention has often centered around the question of how long the American presence would be required after Father Aristide's restoration to power.
 
Four Point Plan
 "The action could be a surgical move to remove the thugs within hours," Father Aristide said of the kind of intervention he would support. "Once we do that, we could have the international community in the country within the framework of agreements we have already signed. Not in the framework of a military intervention."
Outlining his ideas as a four-point plan that would begin with the military action, Father Aristide said international military trainers called for under an agreement negotiated last July in New York should be sent to Haiti immediately after any intervention.
Their role, he said, would be to separate the country's police from its army, and to begin retraining both forces, as foreseen under last year's aborted settlement plan. Almost immediately after that effort begins, Father Aristide said that he should be returned to Haiti, and that international development assistance should be begun on a huge scale to help push national reconciliation.
Father Aristide sought to reassure those who have said he would quickly turn against the United States if he were returned to office through an American intervention. "We are talking about interests, mutual interests," he said. "Not feelings.
"If I could do it alone, I would. If the United States could do it alone, they would. But we have to go together."
At the same time as he was urging the Clinton Administration to take decisive action to restore him to office, Father Aristide renewed criticisms of its handling of Haitian boat people.
 
Bitterness Over Refugees
 Speaking of the announcement this week that Jamaica would allow American ships to process Haitian refugees in its harbors before deciding whether they would be returned to Haiti, Father Aristide expressed bitterness that many of those fleeing his country would be "returned to a house on fire."
"In terms of their statements, yes, they are saying there is a change," he said of the Clinton Administration's handling of Haitian refugees. "In terms of the implementation, no."
The Clinton Administration announced today that it was adding 35 more Haitians, many of them members of the government, to the list of 600 Haitian military personnel and other coup leaders whose assets in the United States have been frozen.
Those added to the list today include Haiti's newly appointed President, Emile Jonassaint, as well as Finance Minister Rigaud Duplain and Foreign Minister Charles David. Also added were the wife and three children of the head of Haiti's military, Raoul Cedras, as well as the children of several other military leaders.

HEADLINE: Study Warns of Growing Underclass of the Unskilled

BYLINE: By CATHERINE S. MANEGOLD, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 2

 BODY:
Opening a wide door for changes in labor law but then hesitating to walk through it, the Labor and Commerce Departments issued a joint report today, detailing shifts in the American workplace but delaying any recommendations to deal with them for months.
The report details the development of an underclass of low-paid and unskilled workers unable to compete in a complex marketplace. The changes come against the backdrop of an increasingly adversarial climate between management and labor while America is slipping behind other industrialized nations in wages and benefits, Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich said at a news conference. 
 The report, by a commission that Prof. John T. Dunlop of Harvard University led, is the first important salvo in the Clinton Administration's battle to change and update labor laws. It offers the closest scrutiny of American labor practices since World War II.
But after a year of study, the report's authors stopped short of proposing a plan for change. One person who has followed the committee's work said the members had had a series of disagreements over how new laws would affect unions, businesses and leading industries.
Mr. Reich spoke of the polarization of the American workplace and the need to find solutions that suit both workers and their managers. He painted a bleak picture of an economy destined to spiral downward unless growing imbalances between those sectors are corrected.
"A society divided between the haves and the have-nots or the well-educated and the poorly educated can not be a stable society over time," he said. He said sharp inequalities between the well-educated, well-paid workers and those at the bottom of the pay scale "spells a breakdown somewhere down the line."
Those remarks and the report's conclusion that "a healthy society cannot long continue along the path the U.S. is moving," seemed to signal a move to increase Federal involvement in worker-management relations. But without a blueprint for that involvement, all sides seemed inclined to take a cautious public stance.
Responses to the findings were measured. Jerry Jasinowski, the president of the National Association for Manufacturers, praised the focus on excessive litigation and global competitive pressures. But he cautioned that in places, the report tended to generalize and imply "a more negative labor relations environment than is justified."
 
Women in Dire Straits
 The Women's Legal Defense Fund said the report underscored the need to close the gaps "that leave so many working women in dire economic straits." In fact, the report found a declining gap in the earnings of men and women. The more troubling statistics, it said, pertain to a "stagnation in the gap between white and nonwhite workers."
An unrelated study released today by the Center for National Policy, a research group, came to the same conclusion. It showed that the median pay for women increased 9.2 percent over the last decade while many of the relatively well-paid jobs traditionally held by men had disappeared, to be replaced by low-paying jobs. As a result, pay for men overall declined by about 5 percent.
The scope of possible recommendations could not be broader. Professor Dunlop, a former Labor Secretary, said no existing law was "sacred." Instead, the next six months promise a broad, though to some extent hidden debate. Dr. Dunlop has a reputation as a tough-minded, behind-closed-doors deal maker who has little patience with public dialogue.
These were among the other problems the commission found:
*Falling real earnings for less-educated and less-skilled workers.
*Stagnant growth of earnings for more-skilled employees.
*High levels of occupational injuries.
*Lack of health insurance and other fringe benefits for many workers.
*An increased proportion of young male workers in prison.
*High rates of joblessness for the unskilled.
Most chilling of all, however, was a brief notation at the end of the second chapter which warned of "a large, growing population for whom illegal activity is more attractive than legitimate work."
Sprinkled throughout the findings are indications that workers, not their employers, may have the most to gain. An anthem of cooperation, collaboration and mutual benefit even seeped into the Commerce Department. Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown, who often advocates big business positions and was a former lobbyist for some of the nation's largest corporations, took the day off and skipped the presentation.

HEADLINE: 9 Florida Hotels Blacking Out A TV Station's Crime Reports

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MIAMI, June 2

 BODY:
Some of South Florida's larger hotels have decided to screen out the newscasts of a local television station because of its zealous coverage of crime news.
The hotel owners, already dismayed by several highly publicized killings of tourists in Florida last year, say they are angry with what they call the sensational style of the television station, WSVN (Channel 7), a Fox affiliate. 
 "It is a continuous barrage of the body bags on the street and the blood coming out of them," said one hotelier, Don Lefton, who said he would block WSVN's newscasts from the seven hotels owned or operated by Continental Companies, of which he is vice chairman. The hotels, which include the Bonaventure in the Fort Lauderdale area, the Grand Bay in Miami and the Pier House in Key West, have a total of more than 2,200 rooms.
Charles Folds, a spokesman for WSVN, said the station was simply giving aggressive coverage to an important local issue. "I'm out in the community, and the No. 1 concern of our viewers is crime," he said.
 
No Effect on Ratings
 Mr. Folds added that while the blackout might shield tourists from some crime news, it would have no effect on WSVN's programming. "We are not going to censor the news to placate them," he said.
Shutting out WSVN will also have no effect on ratings by the Nielsen service; hotels are not counted in its audience surveys. Nevertheless, some hotel owners see the blackout as a small way to aid Miami's reputation among tourists.
About a month ago, Victor Farkas, the owner of the Thunderbird and the Chateau-by-the-Sea hotels in Miami Beach, blocked all of WSVN's programming from his hotels' 340 rooms. "I didn't want to expose my guests to every gruesome detail of every murder that happens in the neighborhood," he said. "It's certainly bad for tourism, it's certainly bad for the local economy and certainly bad for the general atmosphere."
Robert S. Peck, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union in Washington, said, "It's a disturbing trend where those who have a captive audience can prevent people from having access to the news." While Mr. Peck, who tracks censorship issues, said he had heard of hotels weeding out "steamy" movies, "I've never heard it aimed at the news."
Constitutionally, however, the Miami blackout is not a problem, he added, "because the hotels are not the government."
 
Just the News
 Mr. Lefton said, "I welcome people to report the news, but to adopt a pattern of continuous sensationalism is doing our community a disservice."
Mr. Lefton said his company's decision to begin blacking out the broadcasts came soon after correspondence with WSVN failed to bring any change in the newscasts. His plan is to block just the news, not other shows, "as quick as can be done."
The blackout by the nine hotels has not been widely embraced by tourism officials here, said Mayco Villafana, spokesman for the Greater Miami Convention and Visitors Bureau, who pointed out that the city's three other English-language news stations regularly broadcast crime reports.

HEADLINE: Coliseum: Something for Everyone (Maybe)

BYLINE: By SHAWN G. KENNEDY 

 BODY:
On the surface, the deal reached this week to sell half of the New York Coliseum site to the developer Mortimer B. Zuckerman has something for everyone. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, for the first time since it put the Coliseum on the market nine years ago, has cash to show for its efforts: a nonrefundable down payment of $17 million from Mr. Zuckerman.
The Giuliani administration, which had pressured the M.T.A. to complete a deal with Mr. Zuckerman, now has the prospect of a new development to show that the economy is rebounding, 3,700 potential construction jobs and $12 million to $14 million in tax revenues, assuming the project is built. 
 And Mr. Zuckerman and his development company, Boston Properties, have managed to cut the potential outlay to $80 million from $338 million without defaulting on a $33.8 million line of credit.
Beyond that, the benefits for all parties in the tangled transaction remain to be seen, and many questions still loom about how good a deal the city and the M.T.A. received, and whether Mr. Zuckerman has already made money from it.
 
Focus on 'Fair Value'
 "The major focus all along has been on getting fair value," said Peter E. Stangl, chairman of the M.T.A. board, which approved the agreement yesterday. "We got the best deal under the circumstances. The deal was finally done because Boston Properties met our terms."
But in fact, the main points of the deal were largely those that Mr. Zuckerman had been pushing for months: a substantially reduced price and a smaller project on half the original site. And some City Council members, like Ronnie Eldridge and Kenneth K. Fisher, have questioned the prudence of pushing a deal through just to get the project moving.
Although the city and the M.T.A. have commissioned appraisals of the site to justify the price, real estate experts say appraisals are not reliable indicators of a property's value at a time when the market is improving, as it is doing now.
"The more sales and development projects you have, the closer you can get to a worthwhile appraisal," said Paul N. Fox, director of valuation services at Jones Lang Wootton, an international real estate brokerage company. "A strong market greatly increase reliability. We're moving closer to that point, but we're not there yet."
Indeed, Mr. Stangl has acknowledged that the most beneficial situation might have been a fresh start that would have allowed the M.T.A. to rent the office building and exhibition hall while holding back on a sale until the real estate market improved.
That would have required that the M.T.A. and the city to force Mr. Zuckerman's hand, close on the existing $338 million contract and risk losing the lawsuit that Mr. Zuckerman filed in April contesting the validity of the contract.
As the June 1 trial date drew near, Mr. Stangl said, M.T.A. lawyers were less absolute in their conviction that the lawsuit could be won.
 
$100 Million for Half the Site
 The M.T.A. will get $100 million for half of the site it owns at 59th Street and Columbus Circle, leaving the transit agency with the office building to rent and sell when the market improves. The money, M.T.A. officials said, will go for subway improvements.
Additional concessions included the requirement that Mr. Zuckerman pay $6 million for garage repairs and the $2.5 million cost of separating the office building from the exhibition hall. Assuming the one-million-square-foot office and retail project turns a profit, the M.T.A. will get a 20-percent equity interest.
Instead of a letter of credit, which was used as security for the former contract, Mr. Zuckerman wrote a check yesterday for the $17 million nonrefundable down payment required by the M.T.A.
Yesterday, after agreeing to terms of the deal, Mr. Zuckerman's representatives talked mostly in terms of concessions.
"I'm not exactly euphoric," said Edward Linde, Mr. Zuckerman's partner in the transaction for the past nine years. "It's going to be tough." But he added, "We wouldn't be doing it if we didn't think it could be done." Mr. Linde was speaking for Boston Properties because Mr. Zuckerman was traveling overseas.
But critics of the transaction, including Ms. Eldridge, remain skeptical. They say that when the benefits package is tallied -- $11 million in tax benefits from the Industrial Development Agency as well as half-ownership in the Coliseum garage -- it increases the value of his deal with the M.T.A.
Other questions remain over whether Boston Properties has already made money on the Coliseum deal as a result of the compensation it received from Salomon Brothers -- $95 million -- when the investment banking company pulled out as equity partner in 1987.
 
No Profit, Zuckerman Says
 Mr. Zuckerman has asserted that he and his partners made no profit from the Salomon payment because of the huge costs of keeping the project afloat without the benefit of a development deal.
"We have spent in excess of $100 million," said Mr. Linde, reiterating what Mr. Zuckerman has said about the Salomon Brothers payments.
Mr. Linde said the banking company paid $54 million when it left the deal and a total of $41 million to reimburse Boston Properties for predevelopment costs the developers incurred while still partners.
"Over the history of our relationship there were times when we would write checks and times when they would make payments," he said.
Mr. Linde said the costs, which the Salomon Brothers payments helped to cover, included a series of architectural and engineering designs, legal fees and the cost of canceling orders for materials like steel and marble.
Some real estate experts agree with Boston Properties that it faces a difficult task in seeing the project through.
When asked to analyze the transaction recently, Stephen B. Siegel, president of Edward S. Gordon, a real estate brokerage company, said that Mr. Zuckerman's deal was hard to justify, using the current office market as a measuring stick.
"Because there are so few projects, there are few ways of making comparisons in development deals," said Mr. Siegel. But he noted that Mr. Zuckerman was taking a risk that the market would improve. And in fact, he said that to make a profit Mr. Zuckerman would have to charge rent higher than what is now the top of the market, about $40 to $50 a square foot.
From the perspective of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and his aides, there is no down side to the deal, even though the city is putting up $20 million to complete the deal. The money comes from the projected tax revenues that the city expects to receive from the project. Mr. Giuliani said that waiting for the market to recover to at the Coliseum was not beneficial.

HEADLINE: Kudlow Takes Securities Job

 BODY:
Lawrence A. Kudlow, who resigned three months ago as chief economist and senior managing director at Bear, Stearns & Company to deal with a drug and alcohol problem, rejoined the brokerage community yesterday as a consultant to Montgomery Securities.
Mr. Kudlow, who is 46, resigned on March 3 after eight years with Bear, Stearns. There were rumors at the time of his resignation that he was forced out because his substance abuse problem had caused him to miss an important meeting with clients. 
 Mr. Kudlow later acknowledged in an interview that he had a problem with drugs and alcohol and had been in a rehabilitation program for 15 months. But he said he had missed the meeting because he was sick, not because he had suffered a relapse.
Scarcely a month after leaving Bear, Stearns, Mr. Kudlow was named economics editor of National Review magazine. He is also a television commentator with CNBC.
In his new job, Mr. Kudlow will hold a "regular series of meetings" with Montgomery's clients, said Kent Logan, director of institutional sales at the firm. Mr. Logan said he expected that Mr. Kudlow would spend "a few days a quarter" working for Montgomery.
Montgomery, an investment bank and brokerage house based in San Francisco that specializes in four industry sectors, had never before employed an economist or investment portfolio strategist.
When asked about Mr. Kudlow's substance-abuse problem, Mr. Logan said, "To the best of our knowledge he is cured."

Japanese Stocks Show Life As Economy Gains Strength

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TOKYO, June 2

 BODY:
Japan's stock market appears poised to break out of its long slump and surge to its highest level in more than two years, according to a growing number of analysts and investors.
The Nikkei index of 225 issues is now at its highest level since September and has risen 20.6 percent this year. The index closed today at 21,009, down a mere 44.11 points, after four days of gains. 
 Twice last year, in the spring and in September, the Nikkei index moved close to the 21,500 mark it approached in March 1992. But in both cases, the market fell back as the glimmer of an economic recovery proved to be a mere mirage.
But now there is an evolving consensus that the recovery is for real this time and that Japan's long, bleak recession is finally coming to an end. That view was buttressed this week by the release of several economic indicators that pointed, at least tepidly, in a positive direction.
"Fears of deja vu are misplaced," said Kathy Matsui, chief strategist in Japan for Goldman, Sachs & Company, who thinks the Nikkei average will gradually climb as high as 24,000. "You've got a very different economy now."
And even if the market undergoes a short-term correction now, analysts contend it will eventually rise as high as 25,000, signaling an end to the bear market that has persisted since prices started falling in 1990. But while that would be a jump of 43.5 percent for the year, the market will still be far below the Nikkei's high of 38,915.87 at the end of 1989.
Last year, any hope of economic recovery was dashed by the sharp rise of the Japanese yen, which severely hurt Japan's export-oriented automobile and electronics companies. But now the United States, which let the yen strengthen against the dollar to put pressure on Japan in trade talks, is worried about the impact of a weakening dollar on American financial markets. It is unlikely, then, that the yen will rise as sharply this year as it did last year, if it rises at all.
The strong United States economy is also helping Japan, pulling in Japanese exports despite the fact that the strong yen has made Japanese products less competitive.
To be sure, no one expects a robust recovery in Japan. Most predictions are that economic growth this year will be below 1 percent. And some of the economic indicators that have buoyed the market this week look positive only because they are less negative than what have come before.
Corporate profits for the fiscal year that ended in March, for example, were down about 18 percent, but that was less than expected, said Jeff Bahrenburg, Japanese equity strategist for Merrill Lynch in Tokyo.
And companies and research groups are forecasting that profits will rise this year after four consecutive years of decline -- not because sales will increase but only because corporate cost-cutting and restructuring will begin to take effect.
Housing starts, however, were strong in April and the unemployment rate fell to 2.8 percent from 2.9 percent in March. There are some signs that consumer spending is picking up and hopes that an income-tax cut this year will help encourage more spending.
Weak as these portents might be, stock markets tend to move in advance of economic recovery. And a momentum can build as investors fear being left behind as the train departs the station. "Little hints are enough to bring all the cash that's bottled up on the sidelines into the market," Mr. Bahrenburg said.
The key to sustaining the rally, then, will be whether Japanese investors truly jump into the market.
So far, the market has been driven upward by foreign investors, who view the Japanese market as one where bargains can still be found.
But Japanese institutional investors, wary of being burned again by a false recovery, have been more cautious. This week, many of them finally began buying, helping fuel the rally. But in the last two days, selling has balanced buying so that the Nikkei has moved only moderately, despite the fact that trading volumes have been unusually heavy.
In general, Japanese executives and Government officials are cautious about saying the economic recovery is at hand. Less than 1 percent of executives at large companies surveyed recently by Keidanren, a Japanese business organization, said that the economy had already hit bottom and that prospects were bright.
Any setback in economic statistics, then, could derail the market rally. And there are other threats ahead: The Government is unstable, and the yen is still hurting companies.

Bonds Post Increases For 2d Day

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Treasury prices climbed yesterday for a second day and yields fell to a two-week low amid signs that the economy's expansion is slowing, reducing the pressure for higher interest rates.
The Treasury's 30-year bond gained 15/32 , while its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, slipped to 7.35 percent, from 7.39 percent on Wednesday. 
 Bond prices rose after the Commerce Department said factory orders in April fell one-tenth of 1 percent. Also yesterday, the Labor Department reported that the latest four-week average of state unemployment claims rose to its highest level since mid-February.
"The economic indicators that have come out lately look weak," said David Rossmiller, head of $2.5 billion in fixed-income investments at BT Global Investment Management.
The economy "isn't moving as fast as it was" in the last six months, said Sterling Russell, president of Olympus Capital Management, a money management firm in Las Vegas, Nev.
"There's a pretty good chance we'll see a rally in the next two to three months that will push bond yields under 7 percent, or to at least 7 percent," Mr. Russell said. That's because investors may become convinced that inflation, which erodes the value of bonds and other fixed-income securities, is not increasing.
The yield on two-year notes was 5.90 percent, down from 5.97 percent on Wednesday. The note yielded 144 basis points less than the 30-year bond, up two basis points from yesterday. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
 
'Have to Be Cautious'
 Bonds didn't rally more because traders and investors were leery of making big bets before the release today of the May jobs report, a closely watched economic indicator. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg Business News forecast an increase of 289,000 jobs in the month, compared with a rise of 267,000 jobs in April.
"You have to be cautious" about buying Treasuries just hours before the report, said Robert G. Smith 3d, executive vice president at the Smith Affiliated Capital Corporation, a New York-based firm with $1.25 billion in fixed-income investments.
Smith Affiliated has 10 percent to 20 percent of its funds invested in cash. "We've rarely run with a cash position above 5 percent," Mr. Smith said. "We're ready to go with more investments" once economic indicators signal slower growth.
That may be starting to happen. The nation's retailers yesterday reported slower sales in May than in April, according to the Bloomberg Composite Same-Store Sales Index. The index rose 2.65 percent last month, compared with a 4.51 percent rise a month earlier. As a result, yields could make a run at 7 percent, Mr. Smith said.
Treasury bonds are also benefiting from the recent rout in bond markets across Europe, tied to speculation that the Bundesbank and other European central banks will not lower interest rates again soon to spur economic growth. Some investors are swapping European bonds for United States debt securities.
Italian bond yields, for example, rose to their highest level since August. The benchmark 10-year Italian Government bond yield rose as much as five basis points to 9 percent. French bond prices also fell, pushing the yield on the benchmark 10-year French bond to 7.52 percent from 7.48 percent yesterday.
The three-year note rose 6/32 to 10022/32 , a yield of 6.24 percent.
Among intermediate notes, the five-year note rose 1/4, to 10011/32 , a yield of 6.67 percent. The 10-year note rose 13/32 , to 10110/32 , a yield of 7.06 percent.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Has Broad Advance As Bond Pricesa Rise in U.S.

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar rose against most leading currencies yesterday as Treasury bonds gained for a second day.
"People think there's money coming back home from abroad," said James McGroarty, managing director at Athena Global Investments, a Greenwich, Conn., money manager with $400 million of assets. "That sentiment helped the dollar gain." 
 The dollar was also bolstered by optimism about today's Government report on May employment and concerns about rising tensions between the United States and North Korea, traders said.
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.6537 German marks, up from 1.6469 marks on Wednesday. It rose to 104.85 Japanese yen from 104.50 yen.
Bonds rose, pulling the dollar higher, after Government reports suggested that the American economy was not growing fast enough to fuel inflation, the bond market's nemesis.
Most European bond markets tumbled, meantime, amid persistent speculation that the German central bank will no longer be cutting interest rates to stimulate economic growth. The rise in American bonds and the slump in European bonds convinced many traders that investors are returning to the United States.
"The whole argument for a weaker dollar has been based on the notion that capital is moving out of the U.S.," Mr. McGroarty said. "That looks like it might be changing now." The dollar had fallen as much as 10 percent against the yen and 6 percent against the mark this year as American stocks and bonds declined.
Worsening relations between the United States and North Korea also helped the dollar gain, traders said. President Clinton sent his sternest message yet to the North Koreans, saying the United Nations must discuss imposing sanctions on North Korea for breaking the nuclear nonproliferation treaty.
The dollar often gains in times of global turmoil as investors seek a haven for their investments. The yen often suffers most when tensions in Korea escalate because Japan is close to the Korean peninsula.
"North Korea is something you have to keep your eye on all the time," said Jim Raphael, a trader at NatWest USA Bancorp in Jersey City. "The dollar could pop a lot higher against the yen if we wake up to a crisis there one morning."
Other traders said they were skeptical that the dollar's gains would last. The key for many is how the dollar reacts to today's monthly jobs report, considered one of the broadest assessments of economic strength.
"I wouldn't read too much into the dollar's gains," said Steve Geovanis, managing director of foreign exchange at Merrill Lynch. "We have to wait and see if people are impressed by the employment report."

HEADLINE: Trump Pays Bridgeport a Visit To Promote Theme Park Plan

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: BRIDGEPORT, Conn., June 2

 BODY:
The developer Donald Trump came to this economically depressed city today to promote his proposal to build a $350 million amusement park and seaport village here.
As outlined by Mr. Trump and his associates, the project would include a seasonal theme park featuring rides and amusements; a year-round seaport village with specialty shops, restaurants and entertainment and a waterfront terminal for cruise ships, high-speed ferries and trade show ships. 
 Mr. Trump told business and political leaders that Trump Park would create about 3,000 full- and part-time jobs and generate millions in tax revenues.
"The magnificence of the park will make Bridgeport a world-class destination," Mr. Trump said.
The project is far from a certainty. Before construction can begin, Mr. Trump must win several approvals, including environmental permits and approval from the Bridgeport Port Authority.
He hopes to build the project on 100 acres of land located along the eastern portion of Bridgeport Harbor. The land includes Pleasure Beach, the site of a former amusement park that once attracted thousands of visitors from throughout the Northeast, and an old industrial site once occupied by Carpenter Steel Corporation.
The city currently owns Pleasure Beach, which makes up about 40 percent of the 100 acres. The remaining 60 percent is privately owned. Under the Trump proposal, the city would acquire the private land through eminent domain and then convey it to Mr. Trump. The Trump organization and the city's Parks Board would enter into a long-term lease for the Pleasure Beach area.
Mr. Trump said that Bridgeport, an impoverished city plagued by crime, was chosen as the site for the theme park because of its location and because an extensive amount of waterfront property is available for development.
"If this site were properly developed, I believe it could be absolutely spectacular," Mr. Trump said.
Mr. Trump, the developer of the Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City, spent months last year trying to build support for a casino in Bridgeport. Connecticut does not allow casino gambling, with the exception of the Mashantucket Pequot Indian tribe's Foxwoods casino in Ledyard.
He said today that his theme park proposal does not hinge on an expansion of gambling in Connecticut.
"This has nothing to do with the casinos," he said. "This is a separate plan. If casinos should happen in Connecticut, we'd be involved, but not here."
Mr. Trump said he plans to provide all of the financing for the project, using no public money.
The project has enjoyed widespread support from Bridgeport business leaders since it was proposed two months ago.

HEADLINE: Reporter's Notebook;
For Democrats, Too Smooth a Polish?

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BUFFALO, June 2

 BODY:
A week after a Republican state convention that was filled with accusations of backroom arm-twisting, skulduggery and last-minute deals, the Democratic convention that ended today was a tightly scripted, downright civil affair virtually devoid of drama.
Yet for all their messy maneuvering, the Republicans emerged from their convention energized by the sense that, amid strife, they had chosen the best ticket possible: one that would appeal to moderates and conservatives, women and people angry with incumbents. 
 Among the Democrats, conversely, there were concerns today that despite their smoothly polished process, they had perhaps done too much to protect incumbents and had missed opportunities to infuse their campaign with fresh faces and ideas.
"The Republican convention looked like something out of a movie about Huey Long," said an aide to one Democratic state official. "But on the flip side, when you talk to local Democratic leaders they're worried that, after 12 years, they can't defend Mario Cuomo and this ticket in the hinterland."
Most notably, the two-day convention ended with no guarantee that the Democrats would have a woman on their statewide ticket, although Karen Burstein, a candidate for attorney general, says she will circulate nominating petitions to get on the Democratic primary ballot.
"That's a concern," said Representative Thomas J. Manton. "There has been a tendency among women, perhaps because of past grievances, to vote for women."
Indeed, the Democrats seemed intent on compensating for their lack of female candidates by featuring women on the podium. The keynote address was by former Representative Geraldine A. Ferraro, three women nominated Attorney General G. Oliver Koppell, and Representative Nita M. Lowey was the honorary convention chairwoman on the second day.
The Democrats also studiously avoided controversy and name-calling. When District Attorney Charles J. Hynes of Brooklyn fell short of gaining a ballot spot for attorney general by a mere handful of votes, some suggested that last-minute pressure had caused some of his supporters to defect. But not Mr. Hynes. "I've been a prosecutor too long to believe in conspiracy theories," he said.
To some, an odd role reversal seemed at work: Democrats are supposed to air their fights in public while Republicans are expected to run rigidly choreographed conventions -- a political fact of life that Mr. Cuomo took note of today.
When heckled by a man just as he began his acceptance speech, Mr. Cuomo said: "This is a Democratic convention. If you don't have one or two incidents like this, they begin to think you're Republican."
 
Dealing With the Media
 A repeated refrain today was that if voters only knew more of Mr. Cuomo's accomplishments, they would certainly re-elect him. That was also the message of a workshop for Democrats led by the Governor's chief strategist, David Garth.
As is his fashion, Mr. Garth, who engineered Rudolph W. Giuliani's victory in last year's New York City mayoral election, used the forum to do two things: criticize the media while trying to implant campaign messages with the very reporters he was attacking.
He told the Democrats that reporters "sometimes qualify to be human" and dislike having "to unscrew their rear ends from a chair." He complained of a tendency in the media to get "lost in the immediacy of events" while ignoring substantive issues. And intermittently he ticked off some of what he considered Mr. Cuomo's legacy: better rest stops on the Gov. Thomas E. Dewey Thruway, economic development zones in blighted cities, billions of dollars in infrastructure improvements. "The basic problem is we don't know what he has done," Mr. Garth said.
In his stream-of-consciousness manner, Mr. Garth offered other pointers: do lots of commercials, use cable television as much as possible, never reveal strategy to reporters and don't be afraid to confront your candidate's weaknesses head on.
And he warned against lying to reporters. "I don't believe it's smart to lie, not because of any heavy moral principles, God knows, but because they can catch you," he said. "If I had a guarantee I'd never see that reporter again, FINE!"
 
A Shortened Anecdote
 Governor Cuomo is known for breaking the ice with a funny anecdote, but on Monday night he almost got himself into hot water with one of his favorite stories.
In an appearance with the Rev. Al Sharpton before black ministers at a Baptist church here, Mr. Cuomo opened his speech with a well-worn tale about the first time he was introduced to President Ronald Reagan. As Mr. Cuomo tells it, the friend was about to make the introduction when Mr. Reagan cocked his head, smiled and said: "You don't have to introduce us. I know Lee Iacocca well."
As usual, the story got a hearty laugh. But Mr. Cuomo had deftly left out one potentially embarrassing detail: the "friend" who attempting the introduction was Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the three-term incumbent whom Mr. Sharpton hopes to challenge in the Democratic primary.
 
A Time for Nostalgia
 As any dealer in mementos knows, nostalgia can sell well, but sometimes what's best is what's new. At the Mario Cuomo memorabilia table at the convention, there was a little of both this week.
Among the more popular items at the table run by the Democratic State Committee was a $15 recording of Mr. Cuomo's address at the 1984 Democratic National Convention, a speech that overnight launched him as a Presidential contender.
Barbara Wayne, a Democratic volunteer, said workers found the recordings, marked "collector's item," in two dusty boxes in the basement of party headquarters in Albany.
An even hotter item was one that had nothing to do with the Governor: a $10 button in the shape of the President's oval office, emblazoned with the words, "Clinton '92."
"I only had 25 and they sold out in half an hour," Ms. Wayne said.

HEADLINE: Josephine Moy Hong, 93, Dies; Volunteer and a G.O.P. Leader

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
Josephine Moy Hong, active in Chinese-American affairs and Republican Party politics, died on Sunday in Flushing Hospital. She was 93 and lived in Jamaica Estates, Queens.
She suffered a brief illness, her family said. 
 Mrs. Hong was born in Boston but spent much of her childhood in southern China, where her father moved when she was 8 years old to help develop the mining industry.
She returned to the United States in 1917 and studied economics and psychology at the University of Chicago and New York University. In 1923 she married Louis Fong Sui Hong, who was instrumental in expanding operations in Asia for the National City Bank of New York. The family went to live at Shanghai's International Settlement, an enclave of foreigners guarded by Western forces, when the Japan invaded China in 1937. Mrs. Hong tended to the wounded and sick while under bombardments.
Back in the United States in 1939, she organized a group of Chinese volunteers to raise funds for war refugees in New York. After Pearl Harbor, she served as a director of the National Board of the American Women's Voluntary Service and as chairman of its Chinese unit in New York.
In the decades since, she held leading positions in the Chinese Women's Benevolent Association, the Institute of Chinese Culture, the Chinese Cultural Renaissance Society and the Asian American Assembly, among others.
She turned to Republican Party politics in the 1960's and was vice president of the New York State Republican Heritage Groups Council.
She was inducted as a Life Member of the Republican Party in 1979. In 1982, President Ronald Reagan named her to his Peace Corps Advisory Council.
Mrs. Hong is survived by three sons; Alfred of Jamaica Estates, Robert of Syosset, L.I., and Morris of Fresh Meadows, Queens; a daughter, Virginia Wei of Princeton, N.J.; a brother, Herbert Moy of Chicago; a sister, Mae Wu of Berkeley, Calif.; 10 grandchildren, and 11 great-grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Data Show Eased Pace Of Growth

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 2

 BODY:
Signs that the pace of economic growth may moderate in the months ahead spread today when the Government said its main forecasting index was unchanged in April. The reading followed a March gain as large as any since Bill Clinton's inauguration as President.
A separate Commerce Department report showed the nation's factories obtaining slightly fewer new orders in April, an indication of diminished prospects for what has been a vigorous industrial sector. 
 Still other official figures found first-time claims for unemployment benefits rising on a four-week average to the highest levels in more than a year when weather-induced layoffs in February are disregarded.
 
Retail Sales Slower
 And many retailers reported today that sales last month were slower than expected, although a handful posted solid gains. [Page D2.]
"Growth is shifting toward a more moderate pace," said Gary E. Schlossberg, senior economist at the Wells Fargo Bank. Adding to signs of an economic slowing. the Government said earlier this week that new-home sales and consumer spending slumped in April.
Many analysts expect the economy's growth rate to slip under 3 percent during the second half, roughly in line with a pace deemed sustainable over the long run and far below the 7 percent surge in the final months of 1993.
The new data are making those forecasts seem more secure and therefore ease concerns that inflation will be rising significantly by the end of the year. Last week the Government estimated growth for the January-March period at 3 percent.
Today's reports indicating a weaker economy gave a little support to inflation-sensitive bond prices but the rally was restrained as traders and analysts awaited Friday's Government data on employment conditions for May. The rise in payroll employment was expected to approach 300,000 but this includes 70,000 truck drivers who had been on strike in April.
 
Components Are Split
 The unchanged reading for the index of leading indicators, designed to predict turns in the economy by six to nine months, was the second in the latest three months, with an intervening rise of seven-tenths of 1 percent for March.
None of its 11 components was either surprising or dominating and there was an even 5-5 split between those making positive and negative contributions.
Tending to push up the index, standing at 102.1 on a scale in which 1987 equals 100, were slower deliveries from corporate suppliers, a rise in unfilled orders for durable factory goods, higher building permits, increased prices for materials especially sensitive to the business cycle and an expanded M-2 money supply.
Pushing downward were lower stock prices as gauged by the Standard & Poor's 500 index, a rise in first-time jobless claims, lower contracts and orders for new plant and equipment, fallen consumer expectations and a decline for factories in orders for consumer goods and materials.
The other component, the length of the average workweek, was unchanged.
 
Other Index Readings
 A companion index made up of items that tend to move at the same time as the overall economy, rather than ahead of it, rose two-tenths of 1 percent in April, the smallest of three straight advances. This so-called coincident index now stands at 112.5, or 3.6 percent ahead of its April 1993 level.
The department's index of lagging components rose two-tenths of 1 percent in April after two straight declines.
The Commerce Department's other report today -- on manufacturers' orders, shipments and inventories for April -- showed new orders eased $300 million, or one-tenth of 1 percent, to $274.4 billion. The durable goods portion, estimated preliminarily last week to have risen one-tenth of 1 percent, was revised today to show a decline of that amount.
Shipments of factory goods eased three-tenths of 1 percent, today's report also showed, while unfilled orders rose two-tenths of 1 percent.
The Labor Department's weekly report of initial claims for jobless benefits registered a 4,000 decline, to 362,000, last week, while the four-week moving average climbed 2,000, to 369,000.
"The recent pattern of claims supports our contention that employment growth is about to slow from the unsustainable pace of recent months," Donald H. Straszheim, chief economist at Merrill Lynch, advised clients.

Canadian Bank Hires 5 Lehman Executives

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
Undaunted by the bad publicity surrounding the market for derivatives, the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce snatched five senior derivatives experts from Lehman Brothers yesterday.
Michael Rulle, the head of Lehman's equity derivative area, will run the Canadian bank's global derivative business from New York. 
 The loss is potentially significant for Lehman, which was spun off from the American Express Company just this week. Lehman's derivatives revenue tripled last year to $399 million, 11 percent of its total revenue. Mr. Rulle's equity derivatives unit represented about 20 percent of its derivatives revenue.
"Lehman is in the second half of the top dozen derivatives dealers globally," said Paul B. Spraos, publisher of Swaps Monitor, a newsletter on derivatives. The Canadian bank has been a major provider of derivatives relating to the Canadian dollar, but has had a smaller presence in other markets.
 
A Field of Growing Attention
 Derivatives are a rapidly growing category of instrument that have values that are linked to -- or derived from -- the prices of financial assets such as stocks, bonds, currencies and commodities. Corporations often use them to protect against rises in interest rates or raw material costs.
Investors use derivatives as substitutes for owning securities or to hedge the risks of their portfolios. A typical equity derivative would be an option that gives investors a cash payment if a stock market index rises but limits the loss if the market falls.
Derivatives are among the most profitable product lines for banks and brokerage firms. But their growth in the United States has paused somewhat, as a handful of large corporations disclosed losses from speculative contracts and several bills to increase derivatives regulation have been introduced in Congress.
Jim Beqaj, executive vice president of C.I.B.C., said that the controversy did not reduce the bank's commitment to building its derivatives business.
"I don't think derivatives are a boom," he said. "There is a secular shift as customers move out of traditional financing and investment instruments into other vehicles."
 
Building a Trading Presence
 C.I.B.C., the second-largest bank in Canada behind the Royal Bank of Canada and the seventh-largest in North America, decided earlier this year to merge its commercial lending business with its Wood Gundy investment banking subsidiary. It has already hired several senior traders to form a proprietary trading operation that will invest the bank's own money. And it expects to hire executives to underwrite junk bonds and securities backed by financial assets such as consumer loans, Mr. Beqaj said.
Mr. Rulle plans to hire 50 to 60 derivatives traders and salespeople in the next year, mainly in New York. Initially, the bank will focus on selling more derivative products to its existing Canadian customers, he said.
Mr. Rulle ran Lehman's entire derivatives business from 1990 to 1992, but in 1992 his responsibilities were narrowed to managing just the company's equity deratives unit.
Joining Mr. Rulle will be four other Lehman executives: Bruce Berger will head trading and risk management; Eric Claus will run transaction development; Frank Gelardin will head marketing, and Jeff Seltzer will oversee legal and regulatory matters.
Lehman said its business would be unaffected, adding that on an interim basis, Donald Crooks and Gene Abrams, two top equity executives, would oversee equity derivatives. Lehman's fixed-income derivatives department continues to be run by Craig Schiffer.

HEADLINE: Filling a Trans-Atlantic Air Niche

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
The planes were always jammed, the flights were usually late and prudent travelers brought along their own sandwiches. But long before Freddie Laker or People Express, Icelandair (then called Icelandic) was breaking all the economic rules of airlines, making money by opening Europe to the backpack set -- among them a graduate student, Bill Clinton, on his way to Oxford.
Now, three decades later, the little airline that could is at it again, repositioning itself as the international carrier whose flights all stop in a country that is hardly anyone's final destination. And improbable as it may seem, tiny, unsubsidized Icelandair may once again have found a formula for success in an industry where mere survival is considered a triumph. 
 "There's gold in not following the herd," said Michael Roach, an airline consultant based in London.
 
Using a Loophole
 Icelandair began domestic service in the late 1930's as the lifeline for an island the size of Ohio with long, dark winters and few paved roads. But the airline that evokes nostalgia among the baby boomers really dates from 1955, when it began to exploit a loophole in tight regulations that restricted capacity and kept fares high on trans-Atlantic routes.
Amenities were not a priority on the Icelandair flights from New York to Luxembourg, with a stop in Iceland. And since most passengers were headed for Paris or Brussels or Amsterdam, the long, uncomfortable flight was usually followed by a long, uncomfortable bus ride.
But the stop in the middle did give tens of thousands of 20-somethings the option of lingering to ogle Iceland's bizarre volcanic scenery. Besides, the crowd was sociable and the price was right. Since Icelandair was not a member of the International Air Transport Association, it was able to undercut the group's fares, sometimes by as much as a third. And since the tiny airline "simply was not a threat," notes Daniel Kasper, a consultant at Harbridge House in Massachusetts, the major airlines were inclined to swat it out of existence.
By the late 1970's, however, Icelandair's formula for profitable coexistence was undone by changing technology and deregulation. Direct competition came with the rise of discount carriers and the effective collapse of cartel pricing over the Atlantic. And the costs of operating the airline's DC-8 jets were far higher than those of the jumbos used by the other airlines.
Icelandair survived the early 1980's by laying off roughly one-third of its 1,500 employees and leasing out underused aircraft to carry Muslim pilgrims to Mecca. But the airline remained a marginal operation and its managers were determined to recapture the initiative.
At first look, that task must have seemed hopeless. Icelandair has virtually no natural customer base -- the population of Iceland is less than that of Norfolk, Va. Nor does it have the glamour of, say, Singapore Airlines or the reputation for reliability of a Swissair, which would draw deep-pocketed business travelers.
But in today's airline market, notes Mr. Kasper, small size and a lack of fixed business mission (beyond profitability) are not necessarily disadvantages because they permit rapid adjustment to changing markets. "Icelandair is a classic niche player," he said, an airline with the potential to feed on traffic that is beyond the notice of global carriers.
"We're mainly concerned with our major competitors," said Todd Clay, a spokesman for Delta Air Lines.
What is more, points out Einar Sigurdsson, the director of marketing for Icelandair, his airline does have some inherent strengths offsetting its inherent weaknesses. For one thing, Icelandair shares runways and an air traffic control system with the Keflavik air base of NATO -- a base built to push aircraft in and out in all weather conditions. That means zero congestion and rare delays. Equally important, perhaps, in the late 1980's the carrier's utterly obsolete aircraft and the sense of urgency felt by both stockholders and employees gave Icelandair's managers the freedom to plan from scratch.
"We just didn't have much choice," recalls Sigurdur Helgason, Iceland-air's chief executive.
 
Busy Twice a Day
 Icelandair created a hub-and-spoke route system, with every plane from North America (three a day during the summer, typically two in the winter) stopping in the morning at the mint-fresh Leifur Eiriksson air terminal to transfer passengers to European flights. This minuet is reversed in the late afternoon, with daily westbound planes from Luxembourg and Copenhagen and less frequent service from another dozen European cities connecting with planes bound for the East Coast of the United States. Last year three-quarters of a million passengers went through the terminal -- three times the population of Iceland.
Icelandair's work horse to North America is the Boeing 757-200ER, while the Iceland-Europe spokes are mostly flown on Boeing 737-400's. Both are extremely fuel-efficient, low-maintenance aircraft, and both are among the smallest jets capable of flying long distances over water.
Just as the aircraft were chosen to match the realities of a thin hub-and-spoke system, the service was tailored to fit the realities of a market in which the name of the game is figuring out how to separate full-fare passengers from bargain hunters. Icelandair's economy class, with fares that generally beat the competition, is still as tight as herring in brine. But better-heeled travelers now have the option of a business class with roomier seating, better food and drink, separate check-in and lounges, even limos to the airports.
 
Seeking Its Niche
 Does this add up to a winning formula for the airline? Not on high-density routes, where other carriers fly nonstop, business travelers are accustomed to royal treatment and those riding in steerage benefit from heavy competition on fares. Indeed, the whole idea of creating an international hub in the middle of the Atlantic might seem a problem. "Hubbing is out of fashion," notes Alfred E. Kahn, the former chairman of the Civil Aeronautics Board, largely because the costs of squeezing a lot of traffic through a small window of time and space are generally high.
But a closer look explains why Icelandair made a total of $9 million in 1990 and 1991 on revenues of $420 million, and lost just $5 million on revenues of $400 million during the recession years of 1992 and 1993 while most other airlines were hemorrhaging cash. Start with low costs -- "lower cost per available seat-mile than any European airline," Mr. Roach points out. And while hubbing may be a mixed blessing for most carriers, it still makes sense for Icelandair.
 
A Prime Spot
 Keflavik airport is never congested and, contrary to intuition, Iceland lies on the shortest line between North America and northern Europe. Note, too, that the hub allows Icelandair to provide competitive service where one-stop service is the only way to fly -- Glasgow to Orlando, Fla., for example, or Washington-Baltimore to Stockholm. "Would you rather change planes in Newark?" Mr. Sigurdsson asks.
While an end to the recession in Europe and an upturn in trans-Atlantic travel are likely to return Icelandair to profitability in 1995, there are reasons that its survival is hardly taken for granted. Any of a dozen major airlines has the legal right to fly to Iceland. Much-prized business travelers are hard to pry loose from the major carriers. And Iceland's membership in the European Economic Area means that even routes within Iceland will be open to international competitors by 1997.
But Icelandair's managers think they can turn risk into advantage. Low costs will allow them to compete on point-to-point service within Europe, Mr. Helgason suggests, permitting the airline to diversify away from the trans-Atlantic trade and use aircraft that would otherwise sit idle in the winter. Then, too, Icelandair's modest size, which makes it more an irritant than a competitor to other airlines, reduces the chances of retaliation by the giants. "We have the flexibility to move when we're not welcome," Mr. Helgason notes.

HEADLINE: In Luxury, Purring Understatedly

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES 

 BODY:
THE more genteel the hotel, the more softly it speaks. The Plaza Athenee barely manages a whisper. It is discreet, subdued, understated. In a field crowded with Basil Fawltys, it is Jeeves.
So recessive is the hotel, on 64th Street between Park and Madison Avenues, that cabdrivers were perplexed when, after turning onto 64th Street from Madison, I asked them to stop in front of the hotel. On the first three occasions, the driver looked back with the weak, eager-to-please smile that spells total confusion. Hotel? Where? After a while, I gave up. "Pull up behind that garbage truck," I told driver No. 4. 
 True, the block is quiet and tree-lined, a stage set replete with toney townhouses. Look hard, though, and you will see the hotel, flying the Union Jack and the French tricolor, the two great snob flags. Enter, and prepare to put a serious dent in your credit card.
My wife and I spent a highly civilized two days at the hotel recently, living the way the good Lord intended us to, in the lap of luxury, and in the heart of one of New York's most expensive neighborhoods. Taking advantage of the hotel's special weekend rates we booked a standard room for $250 a night, discounted from the normal rate of $285, which puts the Plaza Athenee up there with the top tier of Manhattan hotels. As a welcoming gesture, the hotel throws in a free bottle of champagne, which of course is not Champagne at all, but a California sparkling wine, although a good one, Maison Deutz. The bottle sat regally in a silver bucket, swathed in a white linen napkin. Continental breakfast, which is $14.50 on the room-service menu, is also included.
The basic room goes under the designation "superior." There is no category below this, and the alert consumer will instantly recognize the rampant inflation that makes "large" the smallest possible size of egg you can buy. The prices ascend rapidly to $365 for a "luxury room," $900 and up for a "deluxe suite," which features a solarium, terrace and formal dining room. The price of the two duplex penthouse suites apparently is too dangerous for mortals to gaze upon with the naked eye. You have to ask. It's $2,300 if you take both bedrooms, $1,950 for the one-bedroom configuration.
As the bellhop led me to my superior destination, he turned back and said, "We've given you a room at the back of the hotel, where it's nice and quiet." He beamed, as if to say, "This is your lucky day." In hotel-speak, "back of the hotel" and "nice and quiet" means "tiny, with a view of the alley."
And so it turned out. The beautifully appointed room was so small that my wife and I spent most of our time figuring out how to get around the king-size bed. Bed sizes, perversely, run counter to the logic that governs hotel-room and egg categories, and at this point they seem to be out of control. Is there no way to reverse the trend toward these sumo-sized sleeping arenas? My first night in the hotel, I dreamed that my wife and I had become separated by a vast distance. Anxiety-stricken, I struggled vainly to reach her, clawing my way inch by inch across a desertlike space, never seeming to get any closer. When I woke up, my dream turned out to be literal truth.
One more point of irritation. The room was on the "14th" floor, which, of course, is one floor above the 12th. It seems worth mentioning that anyone who has decided to visit New York City has already dealt with a long list of fears and is fully equipped to survive the trauma of staying on unlucky 13.
 
The View Beyond
 Back of the hotel or not, the view was quite pleasant, once you got past the water tower atop the building next door. Off to the east, the finials of the Queensborough Bridge peeped out between the thicket of high-rise apartment buildings. A second window received generous north light.
The decor, which the hotel's press kit describes as "modified Neo-Classical," was tasteful and soothing to the nerves. The walls were covered in beige watered silk, the curtains were done in a heavy coral-and-beige pattern and the carpet was a coral-and-cream lattice pattern. Copies of French 17th-century engravings of Roman busts hung on the walls. Coral and cream throw pillows, with beige fringe, adorned the heroic bed. On the wall above the television cabinet, a small gold clock quietly ticked away.
Let us now praise the amenities package. Clustered in a wicker basket, a trove of tiny hygienic treasures revealed itself to our delighted eyes: Neutrogina soap and shampoo, aloe conditioning shampoo, aloe bath gel and a shower cap artfully folded, like a parachute, in a small plastic box. Infinite riches in a little room. True, the printed card tucked in the pocket of the terry-cloth bathrobe sort of suggests that you might be thinking of stealing the thing, but it does so in delicately understated English and French.
 
Kindness and Favors
 Life is sweet at the Plaza Athenee. The service is flawless and unobtrusive. Everything is done for you, without your quite noticing the fact. While getting ready for dinner, I began working up a righteous wrath when it seemed that a shirt I had sent out for laundering had not yet appeared. It was hanging in the closet, where it had mysteriously reappeared ahead of schedule. Small kindnesses and favors flow freely, as though this were the natural order of things. When my wife first arrived at the hotel, for example, the concierge phoned the room to let me know that she had stepped onto the elevator and was on her way up. When the room-service waiter prepared to roll his table into the room, his face registered genuine alarm when I made a move to hold the door open. Such exertions are the province of the staff. The hotel's social philosophy is profoundly anti-egalitarian, and I must say, it does encourage one to re-examine the democratic experiment in a new, critical light.
The room service operates around the clock, and food arrives on the dot. The Continental breakfast consists of juice, coffee, a basket containing an unusually meritorious croissant, a bran-carrot muffin, a little brioche and four miniature jars of Tiptree jam: blossom honey, orange marmalade, apricot and strawberry. My wife rated her French toast as so-so.
The hotel has achieved renown for its Sunday brunch, a belt-busting luau that serves up, buffet-style, appetizers of steamed lobster, poached salmon, smoked salmon, charcuterie, fish and vegetable terrines, and main courses of eggs Benedict, a pasta special, rack of veal, lamb chops and cooked salmon. Then it's onward to the puff pastries, creme caramel and cheeses. The price for this orgy is $33.50, with a $5 surcharge for the veal.
 
Ancien Regime Dining
 The hotel's restaurant, Le Regence, has had its ups and downs over the years, as chefs have come and gone. Three years ago, when Bryan Miller reviewed the restaurant in The New York Times, he demoted it from three stars to two, citing uneven service. On the evening my wife and I ate there, the service was fine. The dining room was outstanding, one of New York's most civilized theaters for eating: elegant, very grown up and unmistakably ancien regime. The decor leans heavily on mirrors, wall sconces and elaborate trim. The vaulted ceiling is painted to resemble a summer sky, with puffy clouds. Best of all, diners get space between the tables, Manhattan's rarest commodity. It is nice to know that one's intimate conversation, or petty dispute, is not providing the evening's entertainment for the tables on either side.
Neither my wife nor I went weak at the knees over the meal, but we ate well. I started with a Maine lobster salad with potatoes and sugarcane vinegar ($16), and followed with a halibut fillet braised with honey and spices ($25.50). My wife ordered sauteed calamari with asparagus ravioli in taragon sauce to start ($11.50) and moved on to black bass in an herb crust with candied fennel and an aromatic vegetable stock ($28.50). The wine list included only a few half-bottles, a setback, since my wife was drinking Perrier. After a brief and dangerous flirtation with the idea of a $58 full bottle of Meursault, I settled for an adequate but unexciting half-bottle of Robert Mondavi chardonnay.
For excitement, I had to wait until dessert, a triumphal baked black-currant merengue with pear caramelized in Sauternes sauce ($10). For those who flinch at the a la carte prices, the restaurant offers a fixed-price dinner that includes an appetizer, main course and dessert for a bargain $25.50.
Having scrimped on the wine, I decided to splurge on an after-dinner armagnac. Most restaurants, and even fairly modest bars, make a killing on ultra-chic vintage armagnacs that are priced like liquid gold. The waiter brought over a perfectly acceptable but quite ordinary product, a Sempe V.S.O.P. Perhaps I had established myself as a poor risk by ordering the Mondavi.
Still, it was deeply satisfying to sip on my armagnac, gaze at the blue sky above and ponder the odd fact that my wife and I, although middle-aged, were clearly the youngest people in the restaurant. A surge of youthful hope traveled through my wizened frame. Some things money can't buy.
Then, back to the cabin on the 14th floor: a small thing, but our own.

HEADLINE: Attention, Gotham Shoppers

 BODY:
New York likes to think of itself as ahead of the curve, but it is not when it comes to the latest trend in retailing: superstores. Those huge, warehouse-type discount stores are increasingly popular around the country, but New York City has relatively few because of zoning restrictions that go back to 1974. Now the Giuliani administration, like the Dinkins administration before it, is considering revising the zoning rules. That would be a sound move if city officials take pains to protect small neighborhood stores that contribute to the vitality of life throughout the five boroughs.
There is ample evidence that the absence of superstores hurts the tax base and creates a drain on the general economy. Many shoppers in search of bargains go to Nassau, New Jersey and Westchester. Jobs that could be available in such stores migrate to the suburbs, too. 
 Consumers also suffer, especially poorer and less mobile shoppers. A 1991 report by the Consumer Affairs Department found that the poor routinely pay more for less, especially in food stores. The report found that many who live in the city's poorest areas regularly drive or take car services to supermarkets far away in search of lower prices, higher quality and a larger selection. Often those markets are in surrounding suburbs.
The main objection to superstores is the fear that they would hurt small shopkeepers. There is no doubt that direct price competition from large discount stores destroys small stores selling the same goods. But in some cases, large stores can actually help small ones; they can act as magnets, reviving neighborhoods, increasing the business of small stores and encouraging others to open.
In rewriting the zoning rules, city officials have to consider urban planning and quality-of-life issues. The world's great cities -- London, Paris, Rome, Tokyo, now Beijing and so far New York -- have lively small-retail economies. Shops and restaurants keep the streets alive and guarantee the diversity and quality of merchandise that is part of the big-city shopping experience.
City officials need to use zoning regulations carefully and creatively, to minimize the impact on small stores. One fair way is to direct retail development to areas where the city will get the most benefit -- where dilapidated factories once stood.
New York would be a poorer place if all it had was a string of discount warehouses. But it cannot ignore a changing national economy. Written 20 years ago, when New York had more manufacturing, the zoning regulations were aimed at preserving the land for industrial use. City officials restricted the construction of some large stores in manufacturing districts, notably food, clothing, carpet and furniture stores. But they never envisioned such phenomena as a Toys "R" Us, a Home Depot or a Staples.
As a result, toy stores, hardware and home supply stores and those that sell office equipment and books can be built in areas zoned for low and medium manufacturing, while stores that sell food, furniture and other goods in the excluded category have to undergo a difficult, time-consuming approval process. That discourages construction and is one reason for the many acres of underused or abandoned land in the city -- land that could be generating taxes.
Over the next several months, officials of the Giuliani administration plan to draft zoning changes for manufacturing areas, including their use for superstores and another complicated but worthy idea under consideration at City Hall: to allow the placement of some social services in light manufacturing districts.
It will be months, if not years, before the zoning regulations would actually be revised. That leaves plenty of time for the public and city officials to come up with fair, sensible changes. But they should remember that if all consumers hear is "Attention, Kmart shoppers," New York will not be New York.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Prisons Save Lives

BYLINE: A. M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
Police and bureaucrats tell the public that crime is going down. But in every survey the public insists that crime is still the country's number one problem, ahead of the economy, health care, poverty, everything.
The American public is a hysterical paranoid dolt, that's one explanation. The other is this: 
 Much of the American public looks at the stories about crime decline, says, well, maybe for you, not me. No, it says -- when I think where I live and walk, where my children go to school, when I look at the pushers, or read about kids with spray guns, my stomach says the danger is no less.
The public stomach is right. The truth remains that the basic crime rate -- all property and violent crimes per 100,000 people -- was 190 in 1960, 400 in 1970 and in the 1990's has been about 600.
So taking the softest, most generalized look at crime, pretending that blacks are not far more likely than whites to get killed or robbed, what do we get? A country where every person is three times more likely to be murdered, robbed or raped than just 30 years ago. This does not inspire grateful confidence.
The figures are from an important report presented last week to a conference at Princeton by Prof. John J. DiIulio Jr. of Princeton University and the Brookings Institution.
The public's anxiety is not simply based on statistics. Professor DiIulio points to other reasons. Blacks, the most endangered Americans, know they cannot get protection whites can afford -- doormen, gates, security guards.
In the cities, white Americans who fear crime are running out of locks and distance. And whatever their color, Americans know the justice system is not keeping dangerous criminals off the streets.
Professor DiIulio says: "The justice system is a revolving door for convicted predatory street criminals, the vast majority of whom enter the system by plea-bargaining, exit it before serving even half of their time in confinement and make a cruel joke out of the terms of their 'community-based supervision.' "
Some of his statistics:
Ninety percent of all criminal cases do not go to trial because the offender pleads guilty to a lesser charge.
"Most convicted criminals rarely see the inside of a prison." In 1989 three-quarters of all convicted criminals were on probation or on parole, not in cells. Within three years of sentencing, nearly half of all probationers had to be put behind bars again for a new crime -- meaning a new victim -- or had absconded.
Nationally, most prisoners are violent or repeat offenders, or both. Over 90 percent of all prisoners are held by states. In 1991, 94 percent of these had been convicted of a violent crime or had a previous sentence to probation or incarceration. "In other words, only 6 percent of prisoners were nonviolent offenders with no prior sentence to probation or incarceration."
Nearly half were serving time for a violent crime and a third had been convicted in the past of one or more violent crimes. Only 1 percent had been sentenced in the past for minor offenses, such as drunkenness, vagrancy, disorderly conduct.
Of the 35,000 people admitted to Federal prisons in 1991, about 2 percent, or 700, were convicted of mere drug possession. The same figure for state prisons was 7.5 percent.
How long do violent and repeat criminals serve? In 1991, 34 states released 326,000 prisoners, 90 percent on parole. Including murderers, they had served 35 percent of their sentences.
The cost of imprisoning criminals is as much as $25,000 a year. But the price to society for every murder is estimated at $2.4 million. From 1987 to 1990, the lifetime costs for violent crimes alone are estimated at $178 billion.
Prisons save lives. Tripling prison population from 1975 to 1989 reduced potential violent crime in 1989 alone by almost 400,000 rapes, murders, robberies and severe assaults.
Prisons cannot end crime, no number of them. But it is intellectually slovenly to believe that they do no good and are filled mostly with gentle, first-time pot-smokers trapped by cruel law. That is as useful as the idea that when you now walk the nighttime streets the monthly statistics will keep you cozy and safe.

HEADLINE: Abroad at Home;
A Question of Authority

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS 

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
Bill Clinton and his people came to Washington believing that foreign policy would matter little if at all to his political success. Late, very late, they have begun to understand their mistake.
Americans may say that they do not much care about foreign affairs. But making a mark in the world -- being seen by other nations as a figure of authority -- is crucial to a President's establishment of authority at home. So it is ominous for President Clinton that recent polls show a sharp loss of confidence in his handling of foreign policy. 
 Mr. Clinton's present European trip is seen by the White House as an opportunity to improve his foreign policy standing. He is also going to make more speeches on foreign issues in the coming month. But the assumption of all that is that the policy is fundamentally sound and just needs to be explained better. I think that assumption is quite wrong.
What people find troubling is that even if a particular policy has merit, it may be good for that day and train only. There is a sense of vacillation and incoherence, of policy driven by the vagaries of public opinion rather than by a President's firm beliefs and a long-term vision of how to achieve his goals.
Certainly friends of this country abroad have such feelings about Mr. Clinton's foreign policy. The International Institute for Strategic Studies, in London, said last week: "The United States, even more than usual, does not seem to be following a steady compass." The Economist put it: "One of the few predictable things about Clintonite foreign policy seems to be that every zig will be followed by yet another zag."
One of Mr. Clinton's problems is his tendency to agonize in public -- to talk about how trying the issues are. Then again he talks so often and so eloquently on so many subjects that he retains no mystery. The public prefers to have a sense of a President's basic verities in foreign policy.
President Reagan was the opposite. He had a foreign policy so basic that no one could misunderstand: Put pressure on the Soviet Union but be ready, at least after 1983, to make deals with Mikhail Gorbachev on just about any subject. Whatever the merits of this Reagan action or that -- Lebanon, Grenada -- the simplicity of the grand design was highly effective politically.
Of course life is not so simple after the cold war. No President can offer us a policy as two-dimensional as standing up to the Soviet Union. Skepticism is in order when President Clinton's policy is attacked by the likes of Jim Baker or Brent Scowcroft, who in the Bush years failed so miserably in Yugoslavia, letting Serbian aggression grow unchecked.
The trouble with American policy now is not a party matter. Charles William Maynes, editor of the quarterly Foreign Policy, was right when he told The Boston Globe recently that the whole foreign policy establishment "has been afraid to confront the new reality" after the cold war. "Both parties want a cost-free foreign policy," he added.
But Bill Clinton is President, and the burden is on him to offer credible policies for a new age. What can he do to improve not just communication but substance?
First, have a bottom line on the tough issues, and tell the world -- and us -- what it is. It is fair enough to tell Americans that a problem is hard; we are not so stupid as to think otherwise. But a President has to go on and say: Here is where we are going and how we are determined to get there.
Second, stop saying defensive things such as that he has talked with 100 foreign policy experts. Even if true, that hardly builds confidence that the President is a man with convictions of his own.
Finally, do not just talk firmly but act firmly. I believe that Bill Clinton's Presidency would look altogether different today if, early on, he had made a real commitment to stop Serbian aggression and genocide -- and led the Europeans to act with us instead of caving in to their faint-heartedness.
What is needed now is a signal of determination. The most likely place is Haiti, which for all the historical doubts about U.S. intervention is a boil waiting to be lanced. If the President really leads, the American public will support him.
To amend Shakespeare slightly: Steadiness is all.

HEADLINE: Religious Right Gains Influence And Spreads Discord in G.O.P.

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ST. PAUL, June 2

 BODY:
After years of quietly building support, conservative Christians have burst into view this year as an important, often divisive, force in Republican politics. They now have control of six state party organizations and are making inroads in several others.
The rise of evangelical Christians, whose presence has substantially grown since Pat Robertson ran for President in 1988, has led to bitter intraparty battles in several states. Typically, traditional suburban moderates denounce the evangelicals as interlopers and fear that their stands on emotional issues like abortion will drive people from the party. 
 The most unexpected success of the religious right has been here in Minnesota, a state that is generally considered a province of liberal Democrats. The evangelicals have turned on Gov. Arne H. Carlson, a Republican who favors abortion rights and gay rights, with such force that he has abandoned hope of winning the Republican Party's endorsement in two weeks for his re-election.
Instead, the party has rallied behind Allen Quist, a corn and soybean farmer and former state legislator with close ties to the religious conservatives. He takes a hard line against abortion and homosexual rights, espouses creationism and contends that there is a "genetic predisposition" for men to be heads of households.
Christians who cleave to a strict interpretation of the Bible have effectively taken over the Republican parties in Texas, Virginia, Oregon, Iowa, Washington and South Carolina and have made significant advances in several other states, including Florida, New York, California and Louisiana. Unlike many economic-oriented Republicans, those in the religious right are fervent Christians drawn to candidates largely for their spiritual views and moral crusades on social issues. These groups are by no means monolithic and vary considerably from state to state.
A big test of their influence will come this weekend in Virginia, when the state Republican convention votes on whether to nominate Oliver L. North, a favorite of the religious right, over James C. Miller 3d for the United States Senate.
The following weekend in Texas, where evangelicals now dominate the state Republican Party hierarchy and effectively forced out the longtime chairman, Fred Meyer, the new delegates are expected to elect a leader who is more representative of evangelicals.
There is also a Republican civil war in full force in Iowa, where religious conservatives are supporting Gov. Terry Branstad, who faces a challenge in the Republican primary Tuesday from Representative Fred Grandy, who is more moderate.
The fundamentalists' influence in the states depends greatly on political structures. In Virginia, for example, the party convention, which is more vulnerable to a fervant group, will choose the nominee for governor, while in Minnesota the convention endorses primary candidates.
Many Republicans who say they are mainstream fear that the party upheavals will undermine the national party's strategy of playing down divisions and seeking to repair the image of intolerance from the national convention in Houston in 1992.
 
'Complete Religious Takeover'
 "This is a complete religious takeover," Mr. Carlson said in an interview at the state capitol here. "Quist sees himself as the Messiah -- that he'll decide right and wrong. And these are people that are very fervent in their support of a pro-life position. So now the issue is, really, 'Are you one of us?' "
Told of Mr. Carlson's remarks, Mr. Quist said: "He's crazy. The Carlson people are throwing everything at me."
Republicans strategists fear that if their party is pushed too far to the right, it will not only hurt them in this year's Congressional elections but could also make it hard to nominate a candidate close enough to the middle of the political spectrum to be a strong threat to President Clinton in 1996.
"This division within the party could be the road block to long-term Republican dominance of national politics," said Steven E. Schier, a professor of political science at Carleton College in Northfield, Minn.
But Ralph Reed, executive director of the Christian Coalition, which Mr. Robertson founded after he unsuccessfully ran for President, disputed the notion that the religious right is made up of divisive extremists. He said, "The Republican Party is likely to be a more grass-roots party and a more family-friendly party."
The ascendancy of the religious conservatives has put the national party in a quandary: while Republicans do not want the party to become more fragmented, they cannot afford to lose the support of the evangelicals. So far, national party leaders have refused to take sides in any of the intraparty struggles.
"The national party has got to be careful," said former Representative Vin Weber of Minnesota, a prominent conservative who accuses Mr. Quist of splintering the state party and whose brother, Joe, is running Mr. Carlson's re-election campaign. "Without the votes of religious conservatives, we're a minority party."
Some Republicans in Texas are fearful that the efforts by religious conservatives could endanger the re-election bid of a more traditional Republican like Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison. They could be an even bigger threat to George W. Bush, who needs the support of moderates to defeat Gov. Ann Richards.
"I have never voted anything but Republican in my life and I consider myself a Christian," said Betsy Lake, chairwoman of the Harris County Republican Party in Houston, who has fought the takeover by religious conservatives. "But they're using our party for their own agenda."
Here in Minnesota, the 59-year-old Mr. Carlson was never a favorite of the right wing. He won the Republican nomination in 1990 only after a far more conservative candidate, Jon Grunseth, withdrew amid accusations of sexual improprieties. Mr. Carlson barely defeated the beleaguered incumbent, Gov. Rudy Perpich. Since taking office, Mr. Carlson has been relatively popular in the state but has made little effort to reach out to religious conservatives. In fact, he turned down Mr. Quist's pleas for a job in his Administration.
 
Who Leads in the Polls
 Although Mr. Carlson said he "cannot conceive of winning" his party's endorsement this year at the state Republican convention, which is dominated by conservatives, that would not mean the end of his candidacy because the nominee is ultimately decided in a primary in September.
Mr. Carlson is far ahead of Mr. Quist in surveys of expected primary voters, although Mr. Quist is closing the gap. Mr. Carlson had 49 percent and Mr. Quist 33 percent in a poll released this week by the St. Paul Pioneer Press and KARE-TV.
Mr. Quist, who has built his support from pulpits at evangelical churches in rural areas, has been known in the state for his strong positions on social issues. A vivid demonstration of his conviction on when life begins was in 1986, when Mr. Quist's first wife, Diane, six and a half months pregnant with their 10th child, was killed in an automobile accident. Mr. Quist saw to it that at the funeral, the dead fetus was put in an open casket with his wife.
In recent weeks, Mr. Quist has sought to broaden his support by de-emphasizing social issues. The top item on his campaign brochure is "taxes and spending," and he has portrayed the Governor as "a fraud on economic issues." He accuses Mr. Carlson of unfairly depicting him as an extremist, a label that he says should be applied to the Governor.
"He's a radical on the social issues," Mr. Quist said in an interview in his campaign office in a suburban strip shopping center. "It's not only that he's pro-choice. I mean, he's doing fund raising for the National Abortion Rights Action League. It's not only that he supports gay rights. He's doing fund raisers. He's that far out on those issues."

HEADLINE: Tenneco Reduces Size Of Case Stock Offering

BYLINE: By KATHRYN JONES, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: DALLAS, June 2

 BODY:
Tenneco Inc. said today that it was reducing the size of a planned public offering of shares in its Case farm and construction equipment division to a 25 percent stake from 35 percent because of weak stock market prices for companies in machinery and other cyclical industries.
As a result, Tenneco now estimates proceeds from the sale will be $335 million to $385 million, down from an initial estimate of $500 million. 
 The disclosures came in a preliminary prospectus filed today with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Tenneco, which is based in Houston, said it would offer 17.5 million shares in the new Case Corporation at $19 to $22 a share.
Dana G. Mead, Tenneco's chairman and chief executive and the chairman of Case, said today that the company would continue to review its options to cut its Case stake further this year, but that any further actions would depend on market conditions.
"One of our strengths is facing reality, and the reality is that market values have eroded," Mr. Mead said today in a telephone interview. However, he said that the outlook for the machinery market and for Case's earnings this year remained strong. He and other Tenneco executives were in New York preparing an international road show to sell investors on Case stock.
Since the offering was announced on April 26, shares of Tenneco and other heavy-machinery companies have been depressed by concerns about rising interest rates. Tenneco shares closed today on the New York Stock Exchange at $48, up 12.5 cents, but down from $51.75 on the day of the announcement.
Analysts said that Tenneco was prudent in revising the Case sale and waiting for a stronger market.
"Better valuations lie ahead" for Case, said Donato J. Eassey, an analyst with Merrill Lynch & Company in Houston.
Mr. Mead predicted that Case would have better results in the second quarter than the first, when it earned $81 million on an operating basis.

HEADLINE: U.N. Told North Korea's Nuclear Record Can't Be Retrieved

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, June 3

 BODY:
As the Clinton Administration warned again that North Korea faces economic sanctions, the top United Nations nuclear official told the Security Council today that it is impossible to tell whether North Korea has extracted plutonium from a nuclear reactor to make bombs.
Hans Blix, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said North Korea had removed all but 1,800 of the 8,000 fuel rods in the power plant at its nuclear complex in Yongbyon, including 300 critical rods comprising the core fuel element. He said that the rods had been mixed up so that their precise location in the reactor could never be established. 
 "We need to know where the rods were and we won't now be able to know this," he said at a news conference after making his presentation to the Council. "That is what is preventing us reading its history."
Access for inspectors from the atomic energy agency to two nuclear waste sites might show if North Korea extracted plutonium from spent reactor fuel in the past, though it would be difficult to know how much. But he noted that North Korea has refused to allow the agency to carry out a "special inspection" as provided for under its safeguard agreement.
He also said he would welcome a more "credible" declaration about North Korea's past nuclear activities.
But Dr. Blix said there is no technical way now of knowing whether North Korea secretly removed fuel from the reactor in 1989, when it was shut down for 100 days, and extracted plutonium from it.
The agency's presentation immediately brought another warning from the Clinton Administration that the next step will be some form of trade embargo against North Korea.
North Korea has chosen "to thwart the will of the international community," said Madeleine K. Albright, the chief United States delegate to the United Nations. She called on the Council to consider its response, adding, "My Government has made clear that these next steps must include consideration of sanctions."
She said that the United States is now ready to start consulting with other Council members "regarding the timing, the objectives and the substance of a sanctions resolution."
France's representative, Jean-Bernard Merimee, said that if North Korea has diverted nuclear materiel for military ends then "the Security Council should consider sanctions."
 
Hopes to Convince China
 Dr. Blix came here from the agency's headquarters in Vienna today to brief the Council after sending members a letter on Thursday in which he said North Korea was continuing to unload the reactor in ways that prevent the world from ever learning if plutonium was removed from it.
Today's briefing explained in more technical terms what is happening at Yongbyon. Dr. Blix used slides and diagrams to explain North Korea's nuclear installations to the Council. Western Council members said the briefing was chiefly intended to demonstrate the Council's concern at North Korea's behavior, give members a chance to question Dr. Blix about the dispute and convince them that North Korea is being unreasonable.
In particular, Western diplomats said they hoped that the briefing would help convince China, which has veto power over Council decisions, that North Korea is deliberately defying the United Nations, making it easier for Beijing to support a trade embargo.
In Seoul, a Chinese Vice Foreign Minister, Tang Jiaxuan, again stressed the need to resolve the dispute through diplomacy when he met today with his South Korean counterpart, Park Kun Woo, a spokesman for the South Korean Foreign Ministry said.
In Tokyo, Japan's Foreign Minister, Koji Kakizawa, said his Government favors giving North Korea a formal warning before sanctions are imposed.

The Economy
The U.S. unemployment rate fell four-tenths of a percentage point in May, to 6 percent, even though the growth in payroll jobs came in well below expectations, the Labor Department reported. The report left many economists and analysts puzzled, wondering if the data were signaling stronger growth and rising inflation or a shift to moderate growth with less of a chance of price increases. [Page 1.] The unemployment rates in New York City and New York State dropped sharply last month to their lowest levels this year, providing added signs that the region is slowly joining the nation's economic recovery.

HEADLINE: Stanford U. Decides to Make Courses Harder to Drop But Easier to Fail

BYLINE: By DAVID MARGOLICK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: STANFORD, Calif., June 3

 BODY:
The F grade, under another name, is about to make a much-heralded and highly publicized comeback on the Stanford campus, from which it has been banished for the past 24 years. But since most professors here have long forgotten how to hand them out, few students are very upset about its return.
But many students are angry about the end of Stanford's longstanding and highly tolerant course selection policy, one that let students pick and choose the courses that appear on their transcripts, depending on the grades they received. As a result, Stanford transcripts have become less like historical records of the successes, failures and in-betweens most students encounter and more like airbrushed records of unalloyed achievements. 
 "These changes send a strong message to students that we want them to take their intellectual lives at Stanford very seriously," said Gail Mahood, a professor of geology and chairwoman of the faculty committee drafting the changes. "If they're dropping classes just before the final exam, that's a sign of lack of seriousness."
 
Wholesale Changes
 Nobody has failed a class at Stanford since 1970, when the rebelliousness that disrupted this normally pacific campus led to wholesale changes in grading. But on Thursday the Stanford faculty Senate overwhelmingly decided to bring back the F, albeit in the more politically palatable form of NP, for "not passed."
This move and others adopted with it could anticipate a broader assault against grade inflation, which has raged at Stanford and other universities in the past two decades.
At Stanford, more than nine of 10 grades are A's or B's, a recent survey found. Some academics call the situation "the Lake Wobegon syndrome," referring to the mythical Minnesota town, created by Garrison Keillor, where "all of the students are above average."
 
Crowded at the Top
 "Ninety percent of the students think they should be in the top 10 percent of the class," said Howard Williams, a professor at Stanford Law School.
Campus officials point out, however, that many other schools of the same caliber are comparably generous. At Harvard, 43 percent are A's; at Princeton, 40 percent.
According to a recent poll published in the Stanford Daily, 48 percent of Stanford's undergraduates opposed the return of the F, with only 40 percent favoring it. But as a practical matter, it is likely to affect few of them. Only 3 percent of the grades now given at Stanford are "no credit," the euphemism adopted here when failing grades were abolished.
"If professors aren't going to give one, you're not going to be afraid of getting one," said Cassandra Thomas, a junior from New York City. Like many students on this perpetually balmy and aromatic campus, where the quiet is punctuated by the sounds of splashing fountains, birds and bicycle brakes, she was more concerned about new requirements that students stop shopping around for courses well into each academic quarter to avoid getting failing marks. "It cuts down on the whole experimentation process," she said.
 
Easy to Try Again
 As things now stand, Stanford's students, many competing for scarce slots in prestigious law or medical schools, can withdraw from classes on the eve of final examinations with no notation on their transcripts. After the students withdraw, they are free to take the courses again and again, until they get grades they like. This practice generates blemish-free transcripts.
But beginning in the 1995-96 academic year, students who drop classes between the fifth and eighth weeks of a quarter will have a W placed on their transcripts to mark the withdrawal. Students who are still in courses after that point will be in them for keeps, with the prospect of a failing grade if they do poorly. The changes will also bar students from retaking a course more than once, and all repeated courses will be recorded as such on transcripts.
Professor Mahood, who said she had been "on the other side of the barricades" when the liberalized policies had been adopted, said they represented too much of a good thing. "There were legitimate reasons for wanting to make the grading system more flexible and to encourage students to be more adventurous in their course selections. Stanford liberalized things like everyone else, but just went further. Probably it overstepped. Now it's trying to bring its policies back into balance."
She predicted that the changes would help correct the distribution of grades at Stanford. "There's a good reason we give A's and B's," she said. "It's not because we're squishy, but because most of those who see they're going to get a C drop the course." But she said the impact of the changes would be far smaller than necessary, and she predicted that another faculty committee would soon address the issue.
"If you think of grades as the slang we use to communicate with students and the outside world, we have a problem in that our vocabulary has really shrunk," she said. "We can't communicate with as much precision as would have been possible in the mid-1960's."
 
Some Object to Changes
 Ronald Rebholz, an English professor who was one of three dissenters at Thursday night's meeting, asserted that the faculty group had fallen into a "punitive mode" and was "branding students."
Student leaders on hand at the meeting also faulted the changes. "We've lost the freedom for academic exploration, which I think is the central mission of the University," said David Cohen, a junior from Spokane, Wash., who drafted an alternative grading policy backed by the students' association.
But the president of Stanford, Gerhard Casper, called the reinstatement of failing grades an important symbolic message. "To fail in some endeavor is something we all go through, and it is not unseemly to remind people that it also happens in a university," he said. "Unless you dare something and admit that you may fail, you are living in an illusionary world, and that is not something that should be part of the notion of an education."
Mr. Casper, the former dean of the University of Chicago Law School, also acknowledged that the proposals would do little to curb grade inflation, a problem he traced to three causes: an improved student body, more lenient professors and the increasingly sophisticated "strategic behavior" of students, who have learned to manipulate course selections to achieve an optimal grade-point average.
"Students are very transcript-conscious," he said. "Anyone who has ever sat on a law school admissions committee knows that."

GRAPHIC: Chart: "SURVEY: Grading Policies Around the Nation"
 
Brown University
Grading: A student can only earn an A, B or C. A teacher cannot give an F or D. (If administrators do not think a student is making academic progress, i.e. taking enough courses, the student will receive an academic warning and a record of that will appear on the transcript.)
Dropping Courses: A student can withdraw from a course without penalty anytime before the last day of classes.
Repeating Courses A student cannot retake a course for a better grade. A student can only retake a course if he or she did not get credit. There are no signs on transcript that the student did not get credit.
Pass/Fail: A student can take any course on a Pass/Fail basis but the only grade given out is a S for satisfactory. If the student fails, a fail grade does not appear and there is no record of having taken the course. The student can change the grade option (go from letter grade to satisfactory/no credit basis) any time prior to the 4th week of the semester.
 
YALE UNIVERSITY
Grading: A student can earn the full range of grades at Yale, A through F. Dropping Courses: A student can drop a class without penalty up to the eight wee of a 13 week term. After the eight week, a W appears on the transcript.
 Repeating Courses A student can retake a class but can only get credit for it once. Both grades appear on the transcript.
 Pass/Fail: Students have two weeks to decide if they are taking the class for a letter grade or for pass/fail, which at Yale is "Credit-D-Fail." A student can petition to go from credit-D-fail to a letter grade but they cannot switch from getting a letter grade to getting no grade. Last year, Yale instituted a D grade in the pass fail option because students were just barely getting by. This is option is limited to two courses a semester.

OBERLIN COLLEGE
Grading: There are no grades below a C minus.
 Dropping Courses: Students can drop a class up to the end of the second week. If a student withdraws after that, he or she will get a NE on an internal transcript which means "no entry." External transcript will not show the course at all.
 Repeating Courses A student cannot retake a course for a better grade but only can retake a course to study with another professor or if the student received a "No Entry."
 Pass/Fail: Students have up to three weeks to decide whether they will take a course for the credit/no credit option. They can switch all their courses to them.

UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT BERKELEY
Grading: A through F. F appears on the transcript.
 Dropping Courses: A student can withdraw without penalty by the end of the 7th week (16 week semesters). After that, a student will get an F if he or she does not finish the class.
 Repeating Courses A student can retake a course for a better grade. The old grade appears but is not counted in the average.
 Pass/Fail: A student can change to pass/fail the end of the eighth week.
 
NEW YORK UNIVERSITY
Grading: A through F. An F grade appears on the transcript.
Dropping Courses: Students can withdraw in the first three weeks of classes. After that, a W will appear on the transcript.
Repeating Courses: Students can repeat courses, but repeats are notrd on the transcript. How these grades are recorded varies by college.
Pass/Fail: Students can take one course a semester on a Pass/Fail basis, as long as the course is not on their major.

HEADLINE: U.S. Says Cuban Exiles Sought Missile

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MIAMI, June 3

 BODY:
Two leaders of a paramilitary group of Cuban exiles have been arrested here on charges that they sought to buy a Stinger missile and other advanced weapons from an undercover Federal agent posing as a corrupt Army sergeant.
The men, Rodolfo Frometa and Fausto Marimon, are prominent members of a recently formed group, Comandos F-4, that Federal investigators said had wanted the weapons for an attack on Cuba. The men were formally charged with dealing in explosive materials without a license when they appeared today before Magistrate Judge Linnea Johnson at the Federal Courthouse here. 
 The men were arrested on Thursday, Federal officials said, after giving the undercover agent $5,000 as a down payment on an order of missiles, anti-armor rockets, grenade launchers and explosives.
The weapons purchase described in the Federal complaint against the men is one of several recent signs Cuban exile paramilitary groups in the Miami area are growing restive.
 
Final Stage
 Cuba's Communist government has shown increasing signs of economic and political weakness since the collapse of the Soviet Union, and exile groups have been busy recruiting new members and financial backers to help them in what they see as the final stage of their 35-year battle to topple Fidel Castro.
But the Clinton Administration, wary of action that could increase tensions with Cuba or even draw the United States into a conflict, has repeatedly sought to dampen the enthusiasm of exile groups by warning them of possible violations of American neutrality and weapons laws.
In announcing the arrest of the Comandos F-4 leaders, the United States Attorney, Kendall Coffey, once again stressed that theme. "The enforcement of Federal laws that prohibit the unlicensed trafficking in dangerous weapons is a high priority," he said. "This is a case about rockets and missiles, weapons which must be strictly controlled."
 
Fracture in Exile Group
 Mr. Frometa, 49, was until recently chief of operations of Alpha 66, an established paramilitary group that has in the past taken credit for several military operations against Cuba. Friends said Mr. Frometa joined Alpa 66 nearly 25 years ago and spent 10 years in a Cuban prison on charges of fomenting rebellion; the friends said he was released and returned to the United States in 1991.
But earlier this spring, as paramilitary groups debated how aggressive to be toward Cuba, Mr. Frometa and several other members of Alpha 66 split from the group and announced they had formed Comandos F-4.
Frady Laguna, who described himself as the new group's second in command, said in an interview today that Comandos F-4 has about 30 members in Miami but also has "trained people in Cuba and in other countries," whose numbers he declined to discuss.
According to an affidavit filed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in connection with the case, Mr. Frometa and Mr. Marimon met last month with the undercover agent "posing as a U.S. Army supply sergeant selling stolen military equipment." The agent showed the men M-16 rifles and photographs of other weapons that he said were also available, the affidavit said, and the Comandos F-4 leaders then agreed to pay $15,000 for an assortment of missiles and rockets.
 
Delivery and Arrest
 The affidavit said Mr. Frometa and Mr. Marimon had "also agreed to purchase more weapons in the future" in order to "launch military operations directed against Cuba." The undercover agent met with the men again at a Miami warehouse on Thursday to deliver the order, and when they began to load the weapons into their vehicle, Mr. Frometa and Mr. Marimon were arrested.
A lawyer who represents Comandos F-4, Luis Fernandez, did not respond to telephone calls seeking comment. But Mr. Laguna denied that members of the group, whom he described as Cuban patriots, had ever engaged in any wrongdoing.
"We respect the laws of this country," he said. "Everything we do is legal and open. Our office doors are always open to anyone, and we do not hide the fact that we hold training sessions for our members."
Mr. Laguna also said he thought it unfair and misguided that "security agents of this country are dedicated to persecuting us, men who are fighting for liberty" when "there are so many criminals on the street and so much drugs being trafficked." He described the arrests of Mr. Frometa and Mr. Marimon as "a trick, whose motive we do not know, but if the motive is to destroy our movement, it will not be successful."
 
Weapons Aboard Boat
 Earlier this year, Mr. Frometa and Mr. Marimon were among seven Cuban exiles taken into custody after Coast Guard officials boarded an 18-foot boat foundering off Key Biscayne and found a cache of weapons, ammunition and money. In a search of the vessel, Customs agents seized about 50 weapons, including assault weapons, shotguns and pistols, and about 25,000 rounds of ammunition.
But Mr. Coffey, the Federal prosecutor, did not file charges against the men, all of whom were then members of Alpha 66. Mr. Coffey said today that the decision was made after "it was determined there was not a provable violation of Federal law."
In Mr. Frometa's public comments at the time, he never denied that the purpose of the mission was military. "We were going to infiltrate a command in Cuba," he told The Miami Herald. "We went to Cuba to make contact. We couldn't make contact so we brought our people and the arms back here."

HEADLINE: Video Poker in Louisiana Is Mob Target, Inquiry Says

BYLINE: By FRANCES FRANK MARCUS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, June 3

 BODY:
Since video poker was legalized in Louisiana in 1991, the blinking electronic machines have swept the state, showing up in barrooms, hotels, crayfish restaurants in the swamps and even at huge truck stops, where the main business is not refueling but playing video poker.
There are now 13,256 video poker machines in the state, and the number is growing. In just one week in April, players put $23.8 million into the machines, about the usual weekly amount, says Gregory Albrecht, the chief economist in the legislative fiscal office. A video poker machine at a truck stop collects about $1,000 a week; a machine at a restaurant, about $800. The state expects to receive $100 million in revenue from the machines this fiscal year. 
 Such numbers have not been lost on others. On Tuesday, 17 men, identified as members of two organized crime families in New York and one in Louisiana, were arrested on charges of engaging in a scheme to skim profits from the video games.
The men, including Joseph (JoJo) Corozzo of Queens, who has been identified by the United States Attorney's office here as a captain in the Gambino crime family, were indicted in an inquiry by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Louisiana State Police that began even before the first legal video poker machines were installed in May 1992.
 
United Crime Move Charged
 "It's a very significant case," said United States Attorney Robert J. Boitmann, "because the indictment alleges organized crime families in New Orleans and in New York united to infiltrate legalized gambling -- that is, the video poker industry in Louisiana."
Video poker machines accept bets of $1, $5 and $10, up to a maximum of $200 at a time, with the maximum payout $500. The state collects 9.7 cents for every dollar bet, Mr. Albrecht said, and turns over 2.4 cents of that amount to local governments.
The dollars are good for the state but a bad investment for the player, Mr. Albrecht said. "For every dollar you put in, you get back an average of 57 or 58 cents." But that has not stopped Louisiana gamblers.
The indictment accuses the Genovese and Gambino families in New York and the Marcello family in New Orleans of engaging in a pattern of racketeering by forming an enterprise to profit from video poker operations while hiding their connections to organized crime.
 
Ties to Organized Crime
 Mr. Corozzo is a close associate of Peter Gotti, whose brother, John, is serving a life sentence in Federal prison. Among those arrested was John Gammarano of Brooklyn, also known as Johnny G., who was identified by the law-enforcement authorities as a Gambino "soldier.
Among those arrested in New Orleans were Anthony S. Carollo of Slidell, La., who was named in the indictment as the boss of the Marcello crime family, and Joseph Paul Marcello Jr., brother of the late Carlos Marcello, who was long regarded as the head of the Mafia in Louisiana.
The others arrested were Steven R. Bolson of Linwood, N.J., a lawyer; Eugene Gilpin of New York; Kenneth A. Jowaiszas of Clifton, N.J.; Paul Morabito of Port Washington, L.I.; Christopher J. Tanfield of Navarre Beach, Fla.; Frank J. Gagliano Sr. of Metairie, La.; Joseph F. Gagliano of Kenner, La.; Cade R. Farber of Metairie; Felix A. Riggio 3d of Hammond, La.; Murton Schlesinger of Metairie, and Aaron Mintz, Anthony Joseph Tusa Jr. and Victor Joseph Tusa Sr., all of New Orleans.
According to the indictment, Mr. Bolson and Mr. Tanfield, both believed to be associated with the Gambino and Genovese families, and Mr. Mintz established a company called Worldwide Gaming in December 1991. Mr. Mintz allegedly acted as the majority stockholder because Mr. Bolson and Mr. Tanfield did not meet Louisiana's residency requirements.
 
Company Called a Victim
 The United State Attorney's office here says Worldwide Gaming, which is now in bankruptcy, became the distributor of video poker machines for Bally Gaming Inc. of Las Vegas, Nev., and Bally Gaming agreed "to furnish Worldwide Gaming with approximately $20 million worth of credit, inventory and cash." Collections from the video poker business were "skimmed, stolen and diverted to the organized crime families," the authorities said.
Law-enforcement officials here said Bally Gaming, one of the nation's largest manufacturers and distributors of gaming machines, was a victim of fraud and had cooperated with the F.B.I.
Neil Jenkins, a spokesman for Bally, said the company was claiming in Worldwide Gaming's bankruptcy proceedings that it owes Bally Gaming $10 million.
Mr. Albrecht and others say the video poker scandal comes at a critical time for Louisiana. The State Legislature, which is scheduled to resume work next week, will be considering proposals to curb the video poker industry's wild growth.
That growth has been helped by the loosely written 1991 video poker law, says Capt. Ronnie Jones of the Louisiana State Police, which oversees the machines. But he said Louisiana "has always had a romance with gambling." Trying to control video poker, he added, is "like trying to plug a dike: you run out of fingers and toes."

HEADLINE: Auto Sales Lose Momentum For Second Straight Month

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: DETROIT, June 3

 BODY:
For the second straight month, auto sales slowed in May from the rapid pace of early spring, growing a modest 3 percent over a strong period a year ago.
Some auto industry analysts attributed the slowdown to factory production constraints, particularly for popular sport utility vehicles. Indeed, sales of all light trucks continued strong, with the General Motors Corporation and the Chrysler Corporation posting their best May light-truck sales ever, while the Ford Motor Company sold more trucks than it had in any previous month. 
But other analysts said the overall sales reflected a general cooling in the economy during the second quarter, illustrated on Tuesday by lackluster new-home sales and personal spending figures for April.
"In the last two months you've had, I wouldn't call it a downturn, but a slowdown in the consumer sector," said Jason Bram, an economist with the Conference Board in New York City. "It's not good news if you're looking for a very robust economy, but it's good news if you're looking long term, and looking for an economy that is on a moderate and sustainable, low inflationary growth path."
Over all, sales of all cars, domestically made and imported, edged up four-tenths of 1 percent, to 820,331. Sales of all light trucks -- including pickup trucks, mini-vans and sport utility vehicles -- grew 7.2 percent, to 539,889.
The seasonally adjusted selling rate for domestically built cars was 7 million units, narrowly up from 6.9 million a year ago but down from 7.4 million in April.
Divided, as usual, by brand and by region, auto dealers gave varying accounts of the market's strength. Some said rising interest rates had unnerved their potential customers.
At Torrington Ford-Lincoln-Mercury in Torrington, Conn., sales jumped 25 percent in the first quarter. But in May they held even with their pace of a year ago. "Coming off winter, there was a lot of optimism, but interest rates and the stock market created some uncertainty," said Phil Herron, the dealership's new-car sales manager.
Still, Mr. Herron predicted his sales for the year would return to their record heights of the late 80's. "The pent-up demand is still out there," he said.
Other dealers said their only problem was lack of inventory. "We have plenty of cars," said David Jimenez, general sales manager of Chris Auffenburg Chevrolet in St. Louis, "but not the ones that sell." He added: "We can get all the Cavaliers and Geos we want. But we can't get trucks; we can't get Suburbans, and we can't get Camaros."
Even for companies that had a particularly grim month, truck sales provided a bright spot. Toyota saw its car sales drop 10.3 percent for the month, to 65,744. But its relatively low-volume sport utility vehicles climbed 42.2 percent, to 6,693.
Luxury-car sales continued to lag behind the market over all. At Toyota, the Lexus division plunged 25 percent, to 7,423. G.M.'s Cadillac division also slipped, falling 17.1 percent, to 18,291. "The luxury market is still soft," said J. Michael Losh, the vice president in charge of G.M.'s North American vehicles sales, service and marketing.
 
A Stage of Recovery
 In general, Mr. Losh said, in this stage of a recovery "the low end gets a disproportionate boost as laid-off people go back to work." Further, he said, some luxury-car buyers may have been surprised by their tax bills, while others may be choosing to buy fancy sport utility vehicles instead of cars.
BMW and Mercedes, however, both scored strong sales gains during May.

HEADLINE: New York Region Shows Big Gains in Job Market

BYLINE: By BARRY MEIER 

 BODY:
Unemployment rates in New York City and New York State dropped sharply last month to their lowest levels of 1994, providing added signs that the region was slowly joining the nation's economic recovery.
The decline in the state's joblessness was most noticeable in New York City, where the unemployment rate in May was 8.4 percent, down from 9.5 percent in April, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported yesterday; the decrease was the largest monthly drop this year. The unemployment rate in New York City was 10.8 percent in January. 
 "New York City has been the main drag on the state economy for a time," said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, the bureau's regional commissioner. "But at this point, the Big Apple is starting to get a bit of a shine."
 
Improvement Statewide

 
 In New York State, the unemployment rate was 6.5 percent, down from 8.2 percent in April, with much of that gain reflecting the New York City results, the bureau reported. The number of unemployed in the state dropped to 554,000 from 705,000
While the declines in the employment rates reflect a positive turn for the state and the city, the improvement may not be as pronounced as it appears. Even though 23,000 jobs were created in the state last month, the main reason for the decline in the unemployment rate was a sharp drop in the number of people seeking jobs, either because they decided to stop looking or they did not start.
Kathleen M. Do, the spokeswoman for the state Department of Labor, said that the decline in the unemployment rate was so sharp in part because the April rate was artificially high. The 6.5 percent rate, she said, was "much closer to what is actually occurring."
The unemployment rate in New Jersey showed a much smaller decrease than the New York data did, falling to 6.9 percent, from 7.2 percent in April. The number of unemployed declined from 286,000 to 272,000.
Data for Connecticut did not come out yesterday. On the day that national unemployment figures are released, the bureau provides separate data for 11 large states; figures for the other states, including Connecticut, are released later. Nationally, the May unemployment rate was 6 percent, down from 6.4 percent in April.
Economists cautioned that monthly unemployment figures could often be volatile. But pointing to slow but steady job gains in New York City in six of the last seven months, several agreed that the metropolitan region appeared finally to be benefiting from the national recovery.
"We think that there is a broad-based slow recovery that is going on," said Rae D. Rosen, a senior economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
Both Ms. Rosen and Mr. Ehrenhalt said the prospects for recovery appeared particularly bright because jobs were being created in all sectors of the local economy.
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, some 23,000 jobs have been created in New York City over the last seven months, with most of them coming in the service, industry and financial sectors. But Mr. Ehrenhalt said the manufacturing sector in New York City, long a source of job losses, also appeared to be slowly stabilizing.
In New York State, job gains have totaled about 60,000 during the last seven months, he said.
Ms. Rosen noted that the pace of the recovery in New York City and the surrounding area still lagged behind the nation over all. And job gains, while improving, are a mere fraction of those lost during the downturn.
For example, while New Jersey has recouped 30 percent of the jobs it lost during the recent recession, New York State has recaptured only about 12 percent, according to bureau data.

HEADLINE: INVESTING;
Even Watchdogs Need Watching Sometimes

BYLINE: By Leslie Eaton 

 BODY:
BY now, every investor has heard that it pays to be a bit skeptical of brokers, investment advisers and anyone else who is selling something. But as a recent incident involving New York City regulators shows, it makes sense to be a bit wary of the watchdogs, too.
Last month, the city's lawyers took the unusual step of disavowing criticisms that the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs had leveled last year at ads run by the College Savings Bank in Princeton, N.J. Paul A. Crotty, New York's corporation counsel, told the bank that "the issue should have been more thoroughly and accurately analyzed." 
 Oops.
As Americans have become increasingly concerned about saving for retirement and college -- indeed, about investing in general -- financial plans have attracted the attention of do-gooders at every level, from Congress down to local consumer groups. While cynics see some political grandstanding, they concede that many of the new watchdogs are really trying to help average Americans. The problem is that some groups are straying into unfamiliar territory, where ignorance or naivete can breed trouble. As usual, New York City offers an early and extreme example of what could turn up elsewhere.
The tale of New York City and College Savings Bank is a tangled one involving lawsuits and a heavy dose of politics. It might seem like an aberration -- except that it echoes a rumpus from last summer, when the city decided to get into the business of policing mutual funds. At an August news conference, the department accused three fund companies of running deceptive ads and issued a brochure of advice on how to buy funds.
In that case, fund industry executives chose to settle rather than fight. The Dreyfus Corporation, however, eventually got the city to agree that its ads were truthful and not intended to deceive consumers. Behind the scenes, many fund executives asserted that city regulators did not have a firm grasp of how funds worked and might have been misleading consumers who relied on their advice. But even lawyers who prepared critiques of the department's guide to mutual funds did not want to make their complaints public, fearing, they said, that they would appear unsympathetic to consumers and that they would rile regulators into retaliating.
Peter A. Roberts, the chairman of College Savings Bank, shares that last concern, but he is not one to take criticism lying down. In the early 80's, he noticed that college tuitions were rising much faster than inflation, and came up with the College Sure certificate of deposit, which pays interest pegged to an index of college costs. The C.D.'s interest rate lags behind the index by 1 to 1.5 percentage points a year, so parents would have to put in more than the cost of college today to be sure of covering their children's future tuition expenses; the C.D.'s now yield 4.5 to 5 percent a year, more than three-month Treasury bills but less than one-year government securities.
Since the bank started selling these C.D.'s back in 1987, Mr. Roberts has promoted them heavily while moving aggressively against competitors. One of his favorite targets is the zero-coupon municipal bond, which is a bond that does not pay interest every year; instead, the interest accrues for a large sum at maturity. The bond's supporters note that the bonds won't raise parents' tax bills; Mr. Roberts argues that the fixed rate of interest could fail to keep up with college costs.
Mr. Roberts's attacks annoyed Zane B. Mann, who publishes the California Municipal Bond Advisor, a small newsletter in Palm Springs, Calif. After the newsletter called College Savings Bank's ads and literature "bogus," among other things, Mr. Roberts sued Mr. Mann for libel.
How did the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs get involved? While working on his defense last summer, Mr. Mann and his associates started checking with regulators across the country, trying to find if they had taken any actions against the bank. After reading about the city's mutual fund complaints, they phoned the consumer affairs department, which then requested information about the bank.
On Sept. 1, Jennifer Kohn, the consumer advocate who had written the mutual funds report, said in a letter to Mr. Mann that "the use of the term 'guaranteed' in the College Sure C.D. is misleading to consumers."
The College Sure ad stated that the C.D. "is the only savings product guaranteed to pay college costs no matter how high they climb." But under truly extreme conditions, this would not be so. "A guarantee that does not hold in a worst-case scenario is not a guarantee," she wrote.
Oddly, the city did not publicize the letter or take enforcement action against the bank. Mr. Mann did not use it at his trial, which he won last November, but did use an excerpt in his newsletter.
Mr. Roberts was furious, not least because, he said, Ms. Kohn had never contacted the bank. Ms. Kohn, who now works for Mark Green, the former head of the consumer affairs department who was elected Public Advocate last November, did not return telephone calls this week.
Early this year, Mr. Roberts complained to the city's new Republican administration. "Obviously, there is nothing in this world that is 100 percent positive irrespective of unforeseeable future events," he wrote.
When Mr. Roberts failed to get satisfaction, his lawyers threatened to sue. On May 6, the city backed down.
Was the problem with the letter's content or with the process? "All that and then some," said Gabriel Taussig, chief of the administrative law division of the city Law Department.
Under its new commissioner, Alfred C. Cerullo, the Department of Consumer Affairs seems to be retreating from its efforts to regulate securities advertising, something already handled by the New York State Attorney General. Mark Wurzel, Mr. Cerullo's chief of staff, said that in the face of limited resources, the department was trying to avoid duplicating other agencies' efforts.
For now, the department is concentrating on more traditional consumer issues, such as protecting tourists from scam artists and publishing brochures of helpful wedding hints.

Fox Rejects Questions About Its Ownership

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 3

 BODY:
Lawyers for Fox Television Stations Inc. lashed out today at reports that the Federal Communications Commission is questioning the extent to which the company is owned by foreign interests.
In a letter to the F.C.C., Fox reiterated its contention that it had done nothing wrong and that it had never tried to mislead the agency when it bought six television stations in the mid-1980's from Metromedia Inc. It also disputed several statements that have been attributed by different newspapers to agency officials. 
 The F.C.C. is re-examining Fox's ownership structure to determine if the company is violating a Federal law that prohibits a foreign company from owning more than 25 percent of an American television station.
To satisfy the law back in 1985, Rupert Murdoch, who controls Fox, became an American citizen and established a separate holding company, Twentieth Holdings, to own the Fox television stations. He currently holds 76 percent of the voting stock of Twentieth Holdings.
Late last month, Fox informed the agency that 99 percent of the money used to buy the Metromedia stations came from Mr. Murdoch's News Corporation, which is based in Australia.
 
Statements Disputed
 Today, Fox's lawyers said they had merely amplified on information that the company disclosed nine years ago. It denied statements attributed to F.C.C. officials that the News Corporation had retained 99 percent of the "nonvoting stock," which appeared on The Associated Press and in The New York Times. Rather, the company said, the News Corporation owns 99 percent of the "economic/equity" interest in Twentieth Holdings and 24 percent of the voting stock.
Fox also disputed a statement attributed in The Washington Post to Roy J. Stewart, head of the F.C.C.'s mass media bureau, who said: "If we knew of that equity control in excess of (25 percent) was in the hands of aliens, we would have raised the question in 1985."
The Fox lawyers said: "It is undisputed that Mr. Murdoch, a U.S. citizen, directly and personally possesses and exercises 76 percent of 'equity control' " of Fox Television Stations.
The lawyers went on to say that there was "nothing new" in information it supplied to the F.C.C. on May 23. "This week's front-page story is old news," the company said.
Karen Watson, a spokesman for the commission, said the agency was still deliberating. "The commission has not come to any conclusions, and the record is still incomplete," she said.

HEADLINE: Stocks Stage Modest Rally, But Trading Falls Below Par

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
All week the stock market held back, as traders awaited the May unemployment data. But when the report arrived yesterday, it was confusing, with part of the report implying more inflation and another part implying less. So, the market continued to hold back in below-average trading.
 Still, after first sending stock prices plunging, traders bid stock prices up in a modest rally that was the best performance in seven lackluster sessions. 
 After falling as much as 16 points, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 13.23 points, to 3,772.22, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500 stock index rose 2.48 points, to 460.13. The smaller-company Nasdaq composite index rose 2.88 points, to 742.38.
 
Volume Is Light
 Volume on the New York Stock Exchange, where 270.4 million shares changed hands, was 10 percent below this year's average of 300 million.
 The exchange's composite index rose 1.26 points to 254.34, with advancing stocks outnumbering declines by 1,350 to 795. The American Stock Exchange market value index rose 1.31 points, to 441.84.
 After a delay in trading, the Times Mirror Corporation's shares rose 3 3/4, to 35 3/4, after the company confirmed that it had tentatively agreed to sell its cable-television properties to Cox Enterprises for $2.3 billion.
 The Digital Equipment Corporation's shares fell 5/8, to 20 7/8, after the computer maker announced a wage and salary freeze for all its workers.
 
Technical Factors Cited
 Analysts were cheered by the overall market rally, but some cited technical factors that pointed toward a modest pullback next week. Alfred Goldman, director of market analysis at A. G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis, was cautious about the next few sessions but was generally bullish.
 Mr. Goldman said some indicators, like the 10-day moving average of advancing versus declining stocks, suggested that the market was more inclined to sell shares than buy in the short run. "But it's not a big danger signal," he said.
 The Clinton Administration's gloss on the jobless data helped prompt yesterday's rally. Laura D'Andrea Tyson, chairwoman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, suggested that the part of the data that implied more inflation -- an unexpected drop in the unemployment rate to 6.0 percent in May from 6.4 percent in April -- might be a statistical fluke, a result of a new formula adopted in January.
 There was "even more uncertainty" in yesterday's figure than in previous figures, Ms. Tyson said, reflecting the Bureau of Labor Statistics' caution about the number.
 Indeed, Katherine Abraham, the bureau chief, said that with seasonal adjustments, the unemployment figure could have been as high as 6.2 percent.
 Six percent is an important psychological figure because Fed economists are thought to believe that unemployment below that level would lead to a jump in inflation, and, therefore, they would be more likely to increase interest rates further to slow the economy.
 With the Administration's clarification, that left the part of the data that implied less inflation -- an addition of only 191,000 nonfarm jobs -- a third below Wall Street economists' consensus estimate of 289,000. Slower job creation implies a slower growing economy and hence less reason to worry about rising inflation in the months ahead, most economists say. That clearly pleased traders.
 A falling Commodity Research Bureau index helped stocks, too, by lifting bond prices and lowering corporate borrowing costs. The index, a closely watched proxy for traders' inflation outlook, fell 2.3 points, to 232.05. Unlike the unemployment figures, which are historical measures, the index is made up of futures contracts and reflects traders' guesses about future price trends.
 Long-term interest rates fell. The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond, another proxy for traders' inflation views, fell to 7.27 percent from 7.35 percent.
 The most active stock, at 7.9 million shares, was IDB Communications for the third straight day. The telecommunications company, whose auditors resigned in protest, saw its shares fall 5/16 , to 8. Wednesday's trading volume was nearly 33 million shares, and Thursday's was 11 million shares.
 In Tokyo, stocks edged lower yesterday after a strong week, which saw closing yearly highs for three days in a row. The Nikkei index of 225 issues ended off 54.81 points, or 0.26 percent, at 20,954.19.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Stages Broad Rally; 2-Month High Against Yen

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar rallied against most major currencies yesterday, rising to a two-month high against the yen, as surging bond prices indicated there was renewed investor confidence in American assets.
"Clearly, the dollar has found a bottom to its recent slide," said Marc Cohen, managing director at C-Wave Capital Management, a currency-trading firm in Fort Lee, N.J. "People who had written off the dollar are reconsidering." 
 The dollar started falling in February when American stock and bond prices declined.
Treasury bonds rallied for the third straight session yesterday, driving the dollar higher, after the Labor Department said its unemployment report might have overstated the drop in joblessness. The department said unemployment fell to 6 percent in May from 6.4 percent in April. Bonds fell initially amid concern that falling unemployment meant higher inflation.
The dollar rose to a two-month high of 105.55 yen yesterday, but slipped in late trading in New York to 105.35 yen, up from 104.85 yen on Thursday. The dollar jumped to a two-week high of 1.6712 marks before finishing at 1.6707 marks, up from 1.6537 marks on Thursday.
"People's attitudes toward U.S. assets improved this week," said Lisa Finstrom, a currency analyst at Smith Barney. "The dollar really got a lift from bonds."
Bonds rose after Katharine Abraham, commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, said the May unemployment rate would have been 6.2 percent, rather than 6 percent if a more accurate seasonal adjustment had been used. The Government is still fine-tuning its new system for measuring the unemployment rate.
Speaking of the dollar's rise, Ms. Finstrom at Smith Barney said, "This is a pause before it heads lower again, at least against the European currencies." However, she and others were more optimistic about the dollar's prospects against the yen, in part because Washington is calling for economic sanctions against North Korea over its nuclear program.
Concern about international strife often helps the dollar, as investors seek a haven for their investments. Japanese government bond prices and the yen fell today in part because Japan is considered most vulnerable should North Korea lash out against America and its allies.
Elsewhere, the British pound was quoted at $1.5060 late yesterday, down from $1.5110 Thursday. The dollar climbed to 5.6795 French francs from 5.6480 francs, to 1.4190 Swiss francs from 1.4040 and to 1,626 Italian lire, from 1,605 Thursday. The Canadian dollar rose to 72.60 American cents, from 72.15 cents Thursday.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Crude Oil and Grains Push Commodities Index Lower

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Sharp falls in crude oil and grain prices drove commodity inflation indicators lower yesterday, but the trends may be as short-lived as the weekend's weather forecast, analysts said.
The Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 futures closed at 232.05, down 2.30 points on the day and more than 7 points below the year's high of 239.20 set on May 23. 
 Hans Kashyap, president of the Analytics Research Corporation, said lower prices for soybeans and crude oil put pressure on the index, a closely watched inflation barometer. But the pressure will probably be temporary, he added.
"The nature of this move is simply corrective," he said.
At the Chicago Board of Trade, grain futures dropped from the opening as rains overnight in the Midwest improved crop prospects in what has been a dry spring.
Soybeans for delivery in November closed 17.75 cents a bushel lower at $6.5975 and December corn fell 8.25 cents, to $2.62. December wheat gained 1 cent, to $3.4925 a bushel, on reports that yields in winter wheat may fall short of expectations.
Traders said grain prices were dominated by the weather because of the delicate stage of the young crops and the sharply lower stocks of corn and soybeans after last year's flood-reduced harvest.
At the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil futures dropped on a report that the United States and Turkey were near an agreement that could lead to lower Turkish oil imports. July crude lost 11 cents a barrel, to $18.12.
Turkey wants to flush Iraqi oil that has been sitting in the trans-Turkey pipeline since the United Nations put an embargo on Iraqi oil after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.
The trade publication Petroleum Intelligence Weekly said that the proposed agreement would enable Turkey to flush 36 million barrels between June and October.
Traders said the oil would be stored or refined in Turkey, and thus Turkey would need to buy much less crude.
Still, "if it comes to pass, it shouldn't drop things below $17.50 a barrel," William Brown of W. H. Brown & Company said about the agreement.
After the close of trading, American officials said they were encouraged by talks this week with Turkey. But Turkey still has to obtain backing from other members of the United Nations Security Council "and they still have to sell this entire package to Iraq, which could be a tricky issue," one official said.

HEADLINE: MAY JOBLESS RATE DECLINED SHARPLY, BUT HIRING LAGGED

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 3

 BODY:
The nation's unemployment rate dropped sharply to 6 percent in May, even though the growth of payroll jobs came in well below expectations, the Labor Department reported today.
With the labor force rising negligibly despite months of brighter prospects, the unemployment rate, which many had thought would be unchanged, fell four-tenths of a point, to the lowest level since November 1990. 
 Today's report left many economists and analysts puzzled, wondering what the employment figures were signaling -- stronger growth and rising inflation or a shift to moderate growth that would make significant price increases less likely as the year progresses.
Bond and stock prices gyrated sharply on the report, advancing on the modest increase of 191,000 in payroll jobs, then declining when the focus moved to the biggest drop in the unemployment rate since 1983, with the accompanying prospect of rising inflation. But securities prices rebounded when word circulated that Labor Department officials had said the drop in the unemployment rate was probably overstated.
In the end, interest rates, which move in the opposite direction of prices, fell as traders and economists concluded that the Federal Reserve would not be rushing to tighten credit to head off inflation. [Page 45.]
The unemployment rate for New York State tumbled 1.7 points, to 6.5 percent, the best performance among the 11 large states for which figures were published today.
The decline in the state's joblessness was most noticeable in New York City, where the unemployment rate in May was 8.4 percent, down from 9.5 percent in April.
Still, the improvement may not be as pronounced as it appears. Even though 23,000 jobs were created in the state last month, the main reason for the decline in unemployment was a sharp drop in the number of people seeking jobs. [Page 47.]
Economists generally agreed that the labor market nationwide continued to improve. But they disagreed about the strength of the gain and what the figures implied for the economy and for the Federal Reserve's monetary policy in the months ahead.
Some analysts, for example, expressed concern that the unemployment rate had reached a level that could not be sustained without accelerated inflation. But others contended that the labor market was nowhere near that point.
The Clinton Administration greeted today's report, the first broad gauge of economic conditions in May, as the welcome fruits of its economic policy, boasting that it had presided over the creation of 3.36 million jobs, more than twice the number generated in four years under President George Bush.
"We're entering the summer in exceedingly good shape," Secretary of Labor Robert B. Reich said at a White House briefing, referring particularly to the job market for recent graduates and students seeking summer work.
All four regions of the country had lower unemployment rates last month, with the biggest improvement in the Northeast, where the drop was to 6.3 percent, from 7 percent.
Another big change was in California, where the rate fell 1.3 points, to 8.3 percent.
California's showing resulted in part from smaller losses of military jobs, which totaled about 8,000 in May compared with 12,000 to 15,000 in late 1993 and early this year.
Labor Department and Administration officials said the May jobless rate would probably prove to be 6.2 percent when revised at the end of the year. A principal reason that the May decline was probably overstated, they said, was the dubious seasonal adjustments for a month in which there are always large school-related migrations into and out of the labor market. Seasonal adjustment is an attempt to smooth out the impact such regular occurrences have on the job market.
 
Confirming a Trend
 There were several elements in today's report that seemed to confirm other recent indications that economic growth will continue the pattern of moderation that has seen the rate of expansion fall to an annual pace of 3 percent in the first quarter of this year, down from a 7 percent rate at the end of last year. Among this other data are recent declines in sales of new homes and retail goods, a stalling in the trend toward fewer first-time claims for jobless benefits, lower orders for long-lived manufactured goods and a slight slowdown in auto sales in the current quarter.
The confirming signals in the jobs report included an increase in payroll jobs that was about 100,000 less than had been expected, even though the May data incorporated the return from a strike of 70,000 truckers. Other elements were slight declines in factory jobs and hours, an unusually small increase in business-service jobs and the shedding of 15,000 jobs in the category of finance, insurance and real estate, which had added workers every month for almost two years.
A significant reason for this apparent slowing of the economy is the higher interest rates that have followed the Federal Reserve's four increases in its short-term interest rate target this year. This surge in rates has brought an end to last year's boom in mortgage refinancing and is now also curbing retail and home sales.
But while some economists took account of the negatives, others contended that they were outweighed by signs of strength in today's report.
"This confirms that the economy is growing at 3 percent plus," said Leif H. Olsen, an economist who has his own investment firm in New Canaan, Conn. "I don't see anything to suggest the economy is slackening here."
 
Citing Some Numbers
 Similarly, Eugene J. Sherman, director of research at M. A. Schapiro & Company in New York, said the economy remained "robust," offering as evidence numbers from the May report, like the rise of five-tenths of 1 percent in average hourly earnings and the spurt of nine-tenths of 1 percent in the index of aggregate weekly hours.
He said it seemed "almost certain that the Fed will have to restrain further," though probably not for a month or more when the economic statistics will presumably be clearer.
The figures were further clouded this time by the Labor Department's annual benchmark adjustment in which it replaces survey data with figures from state records on unemployment insurance, updates the so-called bias adjustment intended to capture jobs at newly formed businesses and introduces new seasonal adjustment factors.
Katharine G. Abraham, the Commissioner of Labor Statistics, said the survey data brought the employment rise so far this year "more in line" with the tally of employer payrolls.
The adjustment raised previously reported payroll employment between April 1992 and February 1994 by a total of 562,000, or about 25,000 a month.
The sharp drop in the unemployment rate resulted mainly from a jump of 534,000 in employment as measured by the department's survey of households.
Still, the ranks of the unemployed have been cut by a hefty 506,000, to 7,902,000, the report showed.
 
Fewer Are Discouraged
 "We're still making progress, though the unemployment rate overstates it," said Maury N. Harris, chief economist at Paine Webber. He noted that the labor force inexplicably expanded by a mere one-quarter of 1 percent between January and May.
The number of so-called discouraged workers -- those who have given up searching for jobs because they think they will not find one -- was put at 436,000 in May, down from 502,000 in April but without seasonal adjustment .
In a change of heart, Ms. Abraham disclosed that the bureau had decided to discontinue collecting data that would have allowed it to publish, beginning next month, the unemployment rate that would have prevailed under methods used through 1993 but since superseded by a process that relies more heavily on computers.
She cited a tight budget and "serious technical concerns" about the quality of data in this parallel survey.

JUST DO IT
The Nike Spirit in the Corporate World.
By Donald Katz.
336 pp. New York: Random House. $23. 
SNEAKER companies are not what they used to be. We all began to figure that out in the summer of 1992 when a Georgetown University basketball player named Alonzo Mourning signed a contract with a company named for the Greek goddess of victory.
In "Just Do It: The Nike Spirit in the Corporate World," Donald Katz lets us know that this was a totally appropriate name. Nike wanted to do much more than merely put sneakers on the rather large feet of Alonzo Mourning. At the time Mr. Mourning was drafted by the Charlotte Hornets of the National Basketball Association, Nike was beginning a new management division that would, in Mr. Katz's words, "manage Mourning's contract with the Hornets, his financial affairs, his public image, his ancillary marketing agreements, and even his charitable work."
Asked where his loyalties lay -- with the team that had just drafted him or the company that had signed him -- Mr. Mourning worked up his finest intimidating scowl and proclaimed, basso profundo, straight into the camera, "I work for Nike."
The contract dispute was eventually smoothed over by millions of Hornet dollars, and Mr. Mourning now plays for Charlotte and he works for Nike. Huge difference. Basketball is just a game. Nike is big business. Entire college teams wear Nike sneakers, and the players perform for mere free tuition while their coaches pocket millions of Nike dollars.
We innocents also came to appreciate sneaker power during the 1992 Summer Games in Barcelona. During the gold-medal ceremony for the so-called Dream Team of basketball, Michael Jordan covered himself in the American flag rather than be seen in the official uniform of the enemy.
No, not Russia or Croatia or Lithuania, but Reebok, another sneaker company, which long before had paid big bucks to sponsor the official American awards ceremony jacket (which, of course, bore the Reebok emblem). I know, I know, these names, Nike and Reebok, the dueling sneaker galaxies, sound like some bizarre figures in a "Star Wars" episode, and Nike even has a cadre of in-house computer-sneaker-technical nerds who go by the Bradburian name of Ekins (Nike backward).
But this, Donald Katz assures us in his glimpse into the world of Phil Knight, the founder and chairman of Nike, and his merrie sneaker makers, this is all real. Gone are the grim old shoe factories of New England. Elvis had his Graceland. Mr. Knight has his sneakerland, a mixture of country club, satellite city on the edge of the shunned downtown, Italian hill town, renaissance university and spaceship with weight rooms.
Mr. Katz, the author of "Home Fires: An Intimate Portrait of One Middle-Class Family in Postwar America" and "The Big Store: Inside the Crisis and Revolution at Sears," applied for permission to study the inner sanctum in Beaverton, Ore., otherwise known as "inside the berm," the close-cropped grassy wall that surrounds Nike headquarters like a medieval moat. Instead of pouring boiling oil on infidels, Nike executives jog diligently around the campus. They need the infidels, to buy all those sneakers. "Without ever having to pass outside the berm, Nike employees can get a haircut, do their laundry, get a massage or a complete fitness evaluation, buy Nike products, and even shop in a store clearly stocked with the kinds of items appreciated by spouses and children who haven't seen a long-laboring loved one in a while," he writes.
Mr. Katz was allowed to spend a year with Mr. Knight, the bearded, athletic, mystic guru of Nike, a former grunt of a University of Oregon runner who, in Mr. Katz's view, became one of the richest and most powerful people in sports through his hip marketing. The access to Mr. Knight is both the strength and the weakness of this book.
I loved the part in which Mr. Knight imports a sports agent named Howard Slusher, "known far and wide in the sports world as 'Hold 'em out Howard' or 'Agent Orange' (the latter reference pertaining only in part to Slusher's red hair)," to bring some East Coast hustle to gentle rain-pacified Oregonians. Mr. Slusher promptly instructs Mr. Knight in how to beat the system at the mega-expensive taxi line in Japan by sneaking up to the last cabby in line and cutting a deal.
Mr. Katz depicts Mr. Knight as being awed that people like Mr. Slusher actually do sly things like this. By this time, of course, Mr. Knight is on a business trip to Asia, where, Mr. Katz most diligently points out, Asians make Nike products at local wages to be sold to impoverished American youths at prices that support Michael Jordan's endorsement fees. Mr. Knight, in other words, is not exactly a dilettante in cutting deals.
Mr. Katz is a good reporter, but the style here is kitchen-sink, with characters and themes appearing and reappearing from oblique angles. I have the feeling that the recent chaos in Michael Jordan's life (gambling charges, the death of his father, his retirement) forced Mr. Katz to keep writing this book long after he thought he was done. There is a lovely worth-the-price-of-the-book anecdote about the abruptly retired Mr. Jordan materializing from nowhere on a rented bicycle at the edge of a schoolyard's concrete court in Laguna Beach, Calif. (he'd been out with a couple of friends playing golf) to take on the stunned winners of a four-on-four pickup basketball game.
Dutifully examining the manipulation of using witty commercials starring charismatic actor-athletes like Mr. Jordan and Charles Barkley, Mr. Katz is slow to ask questions about the morality of all this. Eventually he takes us to a New Jersey merchant with an apparent conscience who broods about selling expensive sneakers to ghetto youths.
I wish Mr. Katz had been a little more clear about the economics and mechanics of sneakers. What makes a good sneaker? How overpriced are they? But he seems to be telling us that Nike is mostly about persuading MTV-addled youths to "Just Do It" and show their rebellious nature by wearing the right brand of expensive sneakers.
Maybe it would have been healthier if Mr. Katz had lobbed questions from outside the berm and forced Phil Knight and his smug colleagues to become a little more defensive, a little better defined. But if Mr. Katz planned for the reader to think and rage independently, then it is safe to say Mr. Katz just did it.

Picking Stocks by the Stars

 BODY:
For those who missed the recent conference on "Astrology and the Stock Market" in Manhattan (about 40 people attended), here are some tips from several of the hot sessions:
 The Art of Timing: Combining Astrological Indicators -- Graham Bates, London financial astrologer. "I'm worried and confused about the eclipses in November. I don't know what they're going to do, but I know they'll be important." 
 Stocks, Planets and Solar Cycles -- Richard Mogey, executive director of the Foundation for the Study of Cycles. "There's a 23 percent gain the fifth year of every decade because of the Jupiter-Saturn cycle. I'd expect the same in 1995."
 The Cosmic 'Inner Winner!' -- Paul Farrell, author of "Think Astrology and Grow Rich." "When Uranus and Neptune go into Aquarius, I look toward information and technology."
 Beyond Cycles: Using Interpretive Astrology to Identify Key Turning Points in Markets -- Charles Harvey, president of the Astrological Association of Great Britain. "When there is a new moon in the eighth house, Placidus system, in New York, there is always a major change in interest rates. That happens July 8."
Want something more specific? Henry Weingarten, who heads the Astrologers Fund (the conference sponsor), predicts, "Novell will be at 30 next May." But, "If it hits 35 before then, I'm out."

Setting the Standards For War Pictures

BYLINE: By Vicki Goldberg 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
AT FIRST GLANCE, "REPORTING the War: The Journalistic Coverage of World War II" at the National Portrait Gallery in Washington looks like the kind of show that only a World War II buff could love. Lots for them to love here: documents, reading matter, fine photographs like W. Eugene Smith's from Saipan -- though most of the photographs are not shown to great advantage. A few, like Margaret Bourke-White's spectacular view of an air raid on Moscow, are impressively enlarged, then cropped to fit into archways.
As for the visual material about reporters, it is by and large less interesting than their words, appropriately enough. And memorabilia like the helmet of the writer Richard Tregaskis or Edward R. Murrow's microphone, though they may quicken many a pulse, will induce narcolepsy in some viewers. 
 Yet what "Reporting the War" (on view through Sept. 5, and partly supported by a grant from Scripps Howard) lacks in visual scintillation it more than makes up for in information, not so much about the war as about what the title promises. How World War II was presented to civilians, how it could be presented, marked a departure from all previous wars and signaled general shifts in communications that have affected the world ever since. The exhibition catalogue even suggests that the news media, which made Americans far more aware of the course and costs of war than ever before, played a powerful role in maintaining the sense of national purpose and minimizing civilian complaints in the face of rationing and shortages.
For most of the world's history, war reporting had followed Thucydides's method, detailing events long after the dust had settled. Narrating history under pressure did not really replace recollecting it in tranquillity until the invention of the telegraph, the railroad, the steam-driven press and photography in the 19th century, when the mass audience was also effectively invented.
Accounts and images of the Crimean War and the American Civil War in the 1850's and 60's reached a large public within months or weeks or sometimes even within days of battle. In the 1870's, a writer remarked: "No record of previous wars can surpass those of the years between 1861 and '71. Anterior to these events we spoke of Napier, Thiers, Gibbon, Bancroft. They were compilers from old documents. Now we speak of The Tribune, Times, World, Herald. They have been eyewitnesses."
World War II broke out just as technical changes made fuller and more nearly immediate accounts possible and cultural changes made people expect them. Limited camera capabilities had slowed images of World War I to the approximate pace of a pageant, but the 35-millimeter camera proved fast enough to catch some of the destructive frenzy of the Spanish Civil War. By the mid-30's, photographs could zip across continents and oceans by wire or radio, arriving simultaneously with the news.
The news was everywhere, in word and image and sound. Copiously illustrated tabloids were increasingly successful. Improved presses and inks brought on the picture magazines: Life began in 1936, Look in '37. (Before Life began, one of Henry Luce's advisers told him that "a war, any sort of war, is going to be a natural promotion for a picture magazine.") Newsreels played in every movie theater; a few theaters played nothing else. ("Reporting the War" does not cover newsreels or feature films, both of which helped shape the public image of war.)
RADIO NEWS, WHICH AROUND 1930 had consisted of a brief evening broadcast five times a week, grew like Topsy throughout the 30's. The catalogue for "Reporting the War," written by the curator, Frederick S. Voss, a historian at the Portrait Gallery, reports that in 1938 a majority of Americans regarded newspapers as their main source of news, but by 1941 the balance had shifted to radio. The medium may have created then what television apparently has now: a class of people who do not read very much daily and may not have access to good newspapers yet are up to date on the headlines.
In 1938, Edward R. Murrow's and William L. Shirer's on-the-spot broadcasts from Europe within two days of Hitler's march into Austria gave a new sense of immediacy and proximity to events overseas -- as radio continued to do throughout the war. The catalogue gives credit to the medium for moderating America's prewar isolationism. Unfortunately, text and photographs do little justice to radio in the museum; it shows up best here on the medium that succeeded and in some cases overwhelmed it, television, in the form of videotaped interviews with broadcasters.
The exhibition salutes the proliferating means of presenting war by including a couple of Milton Caniff's wartime "Terry and the Pirates" cartoon strips and drawings by Bill Mauldin. In a videotaped interview, Mauldin talks about Gen. George Patton's fury over Willie and Joe, Mauldin's unshaven, draggletailed, exhausted, wildly popular cartoon infantrymen, who Patton thought were fostering disrespect of officers among the rank and file.
Communications clearly had reached a stage of development virtually guaranteeing that World War II would be more thoroughly, more avidly reported than any previous war. And the coverage, with its rapid transmission in a variety of media, set standards that people instantly became accustomed to. On Aug. 14, 1945, Robert St. John, having made a shrewd guess when signaled that news of major importance was on the way, reported Japan's surrender on NBC radio about 20 seconds ahead of the competition. Roughly an hour later, he was asked to repeat the announcement on a new medium with a limited audience: television.
The most surprising war reportage on view is the paintings and drawings by professional painters at the front. From the 1850's through World War I, English and American periodicals had printed eyewitness illustrations by artists like Winslow Homer, but it was clear early in World War II that the great visual reporting would be made by the camera. Life's picture editor later said that "World War II was a photographer's war."
This exhibition will not change that estimate, despite the talent of some of the artists. Yet the art has an important place in the history of wartime communications. It was in color, first of all, unlike almost all published photographs of World War II. It covered some events no photographer ever saw, presented a highly personal response to the war and was seen by millions.
In 1943 the Army organized an artist corps, only to have it voted out by Congress several months later. Most of the newly unemployed painters were quickly hired by Life, which had already commissioned many illustrations of the war and which estimated its audience at 22 million people. The pictures then toured major American museums. Painters still respond to wars today, but World War II appears to have been the last time the hand of the artist was routinely called on to inform a mass audience on this subject. Photography's precision, intensity and instantaneity simply took over.
The show also has good material on women's contributions and on blacks', including the struggle blacks waged to support their country and at the same time fight its racism. Occasionally reporters had their own dramas: Ernest Hemingway, sent to report on the war, violated the international injunction against armed participation by correspondents; the Army conducted a pro forma hearing and exonerated him. Another correspondent's article may have tipped off the Japanese to the fact that the Allies had broken their code.
The question is whether the news media have changed responses to war. World War II established expectations of extensive and rapid coverage; technology and the internal policies of communications empires continued to expand along that path -- at least until the military clamped down after Vietnam. George Will wrote in Newsweek in 1983: "If there had been television cameras at Gettysburg, there would be two countries: the carnage would have caused the North to let the South go."
Perhaps. The United States Government forbade publication of pictures of dead Americans during World War II for fear they would harm morale on the home front. But when civilians grumbled about their difficult lives, President Roosevelt decided it might help if they understood where the real sacrifices were being made. In 1943 the first images of American dead appeared. After that they did not stop (though the more gruesome were censored), yet Americans continued to believe they were fighting a "good war."
Did the Holocaust pictures stop genocide? Did television influence America's entry into and departure from Somalia? Hint: The answers to those questions are not the same -- yet one leads into the other. "Reporting the War" makes clear that coverage of World War II was the multimedia operation of its day, and that the news media's power was widely respected.
What it also makes clear is that the clampdown on the press in Grenada, Panama and the Persian Gulf signaled not simply a reaction to the openness in Vietnam but a kind of return to the limited reporting that prevailed before technology and a news-hungry public produced the first widespread and timely coverage of a war in history.

HEADLINE: TRAVEL ADVISORY: CORRESPONDENT'S REPORT;
U.S. Virgin Islands Tighten Tourist Security

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: CHARLOTTE AMALIE, U.S. Virgin Islands

 BODY:
RESPONDING to a spate of recent attacks on tourists, including a pair of robberies that ended in shooting deaths, authorities in this American territory in the heart of the Caribbean are beefing up the police force, cracking down on juvenile crime, preparing a safety advisory and taking other measures intended to better protect the visitors on whom the islands' economy depends.
The new steps follow the killing in April of a 69-year-old tourist from San Diego in a botched nighttime robbery just a few blocks from the port on St. Thomas where cruise ships dock daily with thousands of passengers on board. In another incident late last year, an Italian visitor was shot to death in an apparent robbery attempt in downtown Christiansted, on the neighboring island of St. Croix. Overall, crimes against tourists in the Virgin Islands are infrequent, with only one hundredth of 1 percent of the two million people who visited the Virgin Islands last year reporting they were victims. 
 As a result of the April killing, however, the territorial government is increasing police patrols in the area of Long Bay Road, the only road link between the port and downtown Charlotte Amalie, and installing better lighting on the street and in a nearby housing project. The Virgin Islands legislature in late April also approved a 15 percent increase in the size of the police force to more than 500 officers and stiffened punishments for illegal gun possession. "Everybody is going to see their share of increased protection," Eric Dawson, who as Commissioner of Economic Development oversees tourism, promised.
Most of the cruise lines that stop at St. Thomas already offer port lectures that include tips on security. But Mr. Dawson said the government is now drawing up a comprehensive "visitor's safety advisory" that will soon be available to anyone arriving by boat or plane. In the meantime, advised Fran Secik, director of public relations for Kloster Cruise Ltd., the company that owns the Royal, Norwegian and Royal Viking cruise lines, it is best for passengers "to use common sense and not go off the beaten path." She noted that many cruise lines provided "escorted shore tours with local tour operators" and recommended those as the safest way to see St. Thomas.
Because of violence against visitors, the United States Navy last October suspended port calls to the island of St. Thomas, blaming "a disproportionate number of violent crimes against U.S. sailors." That action came shortly after the death of a Navy lieutenant who was beaten with a baseball bat and shot while waiting to use a public telephone here. But in a recent letter to Gov. Alexander A. Farrelly, the commander of the Atlantic Fleet praised the "positive steps" taken by the territorial government to restore security and raised the possibility of resuming port calls later this year.
Business and tourism groups stress that the problems they have encountered are largely limited to St. Thomas, the most populous island in the group, and that the crime rate on the other main islands, St. Croix and St. John, remains low. "This is a much more agrarian and relaxed island," said Jerry Koenke, president of the St. Croix Chamber of Commerce. The Navy continues to make port calls to St. Croix, and a recent visit to Frederiksted concluded without incident.
"The Virgin Islands are still a safe place to come to," Mr. Dawson said. "Unfortunately we have had these few incidents which mar our image, and we are shocked and dismayed that there has been even one murder. But by and large you will find that the two million people who come here each year find this a good place to have a vacation, and return time and time again."

HEADLINE: Cuban Tourism

 BODY:
To the Editor: I am writing in response to Howard W. French's article about the resurgence of the tourist industry in Cuba ("New Hotels Attest to Cuba's Reawakening," April 17). While it is certainly true that Cuba has beautiful beaches, tourists who choose to go there should be aware that by spending dollars, they are helping one of the most brutal regimes since Stalin to remain in power. Recently, the Castro Government legalized the dollar. Before this, Cubans could be imprisoned for merely possessing a few dollars. The Government legalized the dollar because the economy is collapsing and the people starving. This, on a tropical island capable of producing two, if not three, harvests per year. However, the Castro Government does not allow the people to farm their land and sell their goods for profit. 
 I wonder if the foreign tourists find it strange that no Cubans are ever in the restaurants in which they eat or staying at the tourist hotels. Cubans enter these establishments only as employees.

HEADLINE: As Big Farms Fade, Niche Farmers Bloom

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO 

 BODY:
FROM the roadside, Longneck Farms looks like many of the small horse or produce farms in and around Colts Neck, a small rural town in central New Jersey's Monmouth County.
Past the front gate, however, lie neither stalls of stallions nor neatly tended rows of tomatoes. Instead, there are a half-dozen pens holding pairs of ostriches. 
 "People kind of laugh when they first see it," said Matthew Loving, who, with his wife, Deborah, started the seven-acre ostrich farm in 1989 after quitting lucrative jobs selling bonds in Tokyo. "They laugh until you explain it to them and tell them what the prices are and how much money can be made."
Matthew and Ronnie Horn's 28-acre spread, the Matterhorn Nursery, in Spring Valley, N.Y., in Rockland County, doesn't sell ostriches -- just goldfish, snails, ducks, rare dwarf evergreen trees, Japanese grasses, about 5,000 types of shrubs and plants, not to mention products like English stainless steel trowels, hand-carved bird houses and goat skin gardening gloves.
"We sell anything that's needed in horticulture," said Mr. Horn, who opened the nursery in 1981 after graduating from Cornell University's Department of Agriculture and Life Sciences in Ithaca, N.Y.
The Lovings and the Horns are part of a new class of niche farmers, boutique-sized and up-market, a phenomenon that is expanding as traditional mom-and-pop dairies and vegetable farms are slowly vanishing in the New York region.
Rather than growing corn, rasing chickens or milking cows, these full-time but small-scale agribusinesses sell exotic livestock, specialty produce or ornamental greenery.
"It is one of the promising areas of agriculture, particularly in the Northeast," said Gerald Moore, a spokesman for the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets in Albany.
To be sure, the number of specialty farmers growing pricey produce, or those using strictly organic methods of farming, is tiny; no precise figures exist because they are not licensed and are difficult to classify accurately. And those ranchers raising exotic animals, like emus and alpacas, are even more minuscule in number.
"Right now, the stuff like ostriches, it's almost more of a novelty," said Arthur R. Brown Jr., New Jersey's Secretary of Agriculture. "If you look at it only in terms of money, it doesn't compare to the $2 million to $3 million that a dairy farm sells."
In New York State alone, though, there are 152 herds of captive deer, which are being raised primarily for food and breeding stock, as well as 56 herds of llamas and alpacas, or camelids, as they are more broadly known. "Camelids, especially, have been on the increase in the past five years," said Dr. John P. Huntley, the state veterinarian. "They are used as pack animals and guard dogs."
SINCE 1980, at least seven ostrich farms have also been established in the New York region. The birds are being raised primarily as breeding stock; an ostrich egg can be worth as much as $1,000, and a pair of birds can produce 40 to 60 in a season. There is also a smaller market for the bird's meat (which tastes like beef), skin (only an elephant's is thicker) and feathers (sometimes used as dusters).
The Lovings said they gave up the world of high finance for ostrich farming not for the money but because they sought a slower pace of life. "We made good money doing both," said Mr. Loving, whose farm has 12 breeding ostriches. "But with this job, you can do it without beating your head against a steering wheel every morning."
Specialty produce farmers, those who grow products like radicchio or make goat cheese, are much more widespread than breeders of so-called alternative animals.
"These kind of farmers are a terrific type of ambassador to huge urban populations," Mr. Moore said. "In many cases, these are the only contact that people have with farmers, and it adds a certain glamour to agriculture. And, you never know, some of them are tremendous money-makers."
Often these farmers thrive because they sell their products directly to consumers either at their own stands or in greenmarkets, also known as farmers' markets, in nearby cities. In Connecticut, for example, the number of farmers' markets rose to 38 in 1993 from 13 in 1989.
"There is also a demand for wider varieties of foods, and a tremendous awareness of food that has taken place in the last 10 or 15 years has created a lot of interest in high-end speciality and ethnic markets," he added. "We are seeing quite an increase in the number of people who have gotten into these markets, as well."
About 10 years ago, for example, Richard Blew Jr., of Fairton in southern New Jersey, started growing jalapeno peppers -- a crop more common to New Mexico than New Jersey -- in addition to sweet corn and tomatoes on his family's farm.
"Back then, I didn't know anyone who grew them," he said. "But now, there is more of a demand for Mexican food, and we grow a lot of them for a Mexican guy who sells maybe 200 to 300 bushels a week in New York City."
Even more than speciality produce growers, nursery owners have had a significant success in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, with dozens of greenhouses and landscaping businesses opening in the last decade and offering decorative products like potted plants and dried flowers.
"Vegetables used to be the No. 1 commodity group in New Jersey, and dairy, a long time ago, used to be No. 1," Mr. Brown said. "But the No. 1 group for the last several years has been nurseries, greenhouses and sod production."
HE added that the increase in nurseries was linked to the explosive land development that started in the late 70's and early 80's as baby boomers began having children, moving to the suburbs and attempting to make their lives as pastoral as possible.
With prices for some small bushes, like Abies koreana (Horstmann's silberlocke) a newly introduced conifer, costing $150 and up, and miniature maples selling for $3,000 to $4,000, traditional farmers have been quick to notice the profit margin of the nursery business.
"We are slowly getting out of vegetables, and we are going to get into perennials," said Mr. Blew, whose family has been operating a 60-acre farm for three generations. "It is just a lot harder to make a living growing vegetables."
Some nursery owners have even turned their grounds into small theme parks, merging the gardening chic of Smith & Hawken with the showmanship of Walt Disney.
At the Matterhorn Nursery, for example, there are small shops on the grounds that sell gardening books and lawn ornaments, an outdoor toy train that runs through a model of an Alpine Village and park-like gardens for strolling and sitting. There is even a cappuccino stand.
"We want people to have an experience, not just buy a plant," Mr. Horn said. "We want them to spend two or three hours here, sitting around our ponds, contemplating, reading or enjoying the animals."
Matterhorn, like many other nurseries, also provides landscaping, design and professional gardening services to businesses and homeowners, though this segment of the market has been diminished somewhat by the recent recession.
"What we have found with the commercial end is that they really don't take pride in their landscapes like they used to, and yes, business has leveled off," Mr. Horn said. "But certain companies, like Pepsico with their headquarters in Purchase, do take pride in their landscape and know that if the working atmosphere for employees is nice and clean then the employee's attitude and performance will improve."
Ironically, perhaps, the suburban ideal marketed by Mr. Horn and the desire among urban refugees for a more rural life are leading factors in the disappearance of traditional farms.
The amount of land used for farming has been on the decline for decades in the New York metropolitan region, largely because of increased real estate development and, to a lesser degree, because of rising costs, taxes and environmental regulation.
In New York State, for example, the number of farms fell 22 percent from 1983 to 1992, to 38,000 from 49,000; the amount of land used for farming during the same time dropped 14 percent, to 8.2 million acres from 9.5 million acres. In New Jersey, the number of farms has declined 11.5 percent, from 9,500 in 1983 to 8,400 in 1993; acreage declined 13 percent, from 1 million to 870,000 over the same period.
A survey of endangered agricultural regions compiled last year by the American Farmland Trust, a Washington-based private nonprofit organization working to stop the loss of productive farmland, ranked New York's Hudson River Valley and Lake Champlain area as the 12th most threatened in the nation. "We have to come to the realization that not everyone can have five acres in the countryside," said Ralph E. Grossi, the president of the trust.
NEW JERSEY and Connecticut each have programs to help farmers who might be tempted to sell their land to developers, though the decline of new construction during the last five years has helped take some of these pressures away.
In New Jersey, the state purchases development easements or directly buys farmland that it later auctions with permanent deed restrictions. As of 1993, 116 farms covering 17,141 acres had been permanently preserved by the program at a cost of about $60 million.
Connecticut has similar programs, which have saved 159 farms and more than 24,500 acres of farmland, most through the purchase of development rights since 1978. The state is also attempting to turn newly available land -- like mothballed mental health facilities -- into farmland.
"We would like to do a lot more," said John J. Filchak, the deputy commissioner for Connecticut's Department of Agriculture. "Our immediate goal is to get to 80,000 acres. There are about 400,000 acres left and 175,000 acres falls into prime and important farmland soils."
"Right now," he said, "we are doing as many as 12 to 14 a year, but we are in a kind of race against the clock and development. Even though development isn't quite the issue it was back in the late 1980's when people were bidding up the price of land, it is still an issue."
Mr. Filchak said that farmland now could cost $1,000 to $3,000 an acre, depending on its location, but developers could still pay up to $5,000 to $8,000 an acre.
"What we do, essentially, is pay the farmer the difference not to sell," he said.
The benefit to taxpayers, according to Mr. Filchak, is both practical and esthetic. He said that the state should have a land base to provide food and fiber for its own population.
"There is an assumption that you get your food from the grocery store," he said. "But you might not always be able to make that assumption that you can get products in abundance. There are severe problems out west with the water supply, and we can grow just about anything in Connecticut."
He also said that the sight of farmland added an intangible value to land. "It's part of the rural character of the state," he said. "It provides vistas that people want and will pay to get."
MR. FILCHAK added that many farmers were retiring and that some had not done adequate estate planning.
"Estate planning is critical if a farmer's goal is to keep the land for agricultural use or as a large parcel," he said. "We have had horror stories about how farms are lost because a good portion had to be sold to pay taxes."
New York State does not have a farm retention program, although one does exist at the county level on Long Island. "The costs would be really enormous to do it statewide, and I am not really sure it is necessary," Mr. Moore said. "There is a lot of land in New York, and people who sell their farms to the state are often the ones that are going broke, not the good ones.
"In Long Island, you have a homogeneous geography, the land is all developable and the population is clearly interested in preservation," he said. "But in New York, politically, I think you would get a lot of grief from city people about spending money to buy farms."
"The best way to keep land for agricultural use," he added, "is to have a farmer on it who is making a living."

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/The Photography District;
Economics and Technology Alter a Neighborhood

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
ANYONE walking down West 20th Street between Fifth Avenue and Avenue of the Americas would swear the photography district is alive, well and booming.
There's Nancy Brown's studio and a couple of others at 6 West 20th Street. And there are all the Duggal family operations -- the 24-hour photo processing lab, serving professional and retail clients, the finishing-touches operation, where photos are mounted, and soon there will be a Duggal digital imaging center, which will convert images on computer disks into posters, film or the like. 
 The Duggal family is even talking about putting in a digital studio, where photographers can use computerized cameras to take images that can be cropped and otherwise edited directly on computer screen.
"Our business is great," said Baldev Duggal, who bought 9 West 20th Street a few years ago and has been expanding his rental space in 3, 11 and 15 West 20th Street. "I now wish I'd bought all these buildings."
But the truth is, neither Mr. Duggal's euphoria nor the bustle on West 20th Street is typical any longer. The block remains the heart of New York's photography district. But over the last five years or so, that district -- once radiating east to Park Avenue South and west to Seventh Avenue, spilling over as far north as 25th Street and as far south as 14th Street -- has eroded to the point where it has practically vanished.
No one has collected statistics. But photographers and real estate people say the trend is too marked to go unnoticed. They say that many photographers have moved to SoHo, to Brooklyn or out of state altogether. Others have doubled, tripled or even quadrupled up in studios. And still others are simply renting studio space whenever they have a shoot.
"People are sharing studios, working out of their apartments or leaving the business altogether," said Marilyn Wallen, executive director of Advertising Photographers of New York, a professional association whose membership has eroded by more than 20 percent in the last two years.
Local landlords feel the pinch. "Photographers who rented big studios for $5,000 a month now have small spaces elsewhere and rent large ones by the day," said Michael Dezer, who owns 15 buildings in the area.
With the dispersal of photographers has come the inevitable dispersal of photographic services. Perhaps the biggest rental studio, Industria, opened all the way downtown, at 775 Washington Street. Baldev Duggal has opened a processing lab in SoHo.
Winoker Realty, which was just hired to rent out 850 Seventh Avenue, a residential building on 54th Street that has been converted to commercial lofts, plans to market the space to photographers. Fred I. Adlman, Winoker's executive director, says he will emphasize the building's many bathrooms as convertible to darkrooms, a factor he sees as more important than the uptown location.
It's a mighty comedown for a photography district that once was to still photography and New York what Hollywood is to moviemaking and Los Angeles. What happened?
Part of the answer is the recession; the photography industry, like so many others, grew far larger in the 80's than its market could support in the 90's. But the answer also lies with advertisers and magazines that increasingly favor location shoots over studios, and in computers that can yield a "perfect" picture without time-consuming -- and lucrative, for the photographer -- retakes.
And there are real estate wrinkles that have little to do with photography. Over the last few years the entire western part of midtown south, the much larger area within which the photography district had once been a self-contained enclave, has gone from a seedy, also-ran neighborhood to a neighborhood characterized by fashionable funk.
MANY old buildings have been converted to residential lofts. And many commercial buildings have attracted advertising agencies, publishing houses and other companies that flocked down to escape expensive midtown rents in the 1980's, and stayed. The conversion of Ladies Mile, that stretch of Avenue of the Americas from 17th to 23d Street, into a value-priced retail corridor has added to the commercial gentrification.
A result has been a rise in commercial rents to as much as $20 a square foot, eminently affordable for a company that can squeeze an office full of people into 5,000 square feet, but prohibitive for photographers eking out ever-more-meager livings.
Many local landlords have tried to help. Mr. Dezer has let some hard-pressed tenants barter photographic services to him in exchange for part of their rent. And he says he factors in the cost of customizing space for an office tenant when he figures if he can afford to keep a low-paying photographer. Still, even Mr. Dezer says he is writing shorter leases than he used to because he wants to keep his rental options open as the recession draws to a close.
The influx of higher-paying tenants is a point of no small bitterness to the photographic community. Many Manhattan photographers rented their studios "as is" and improved the properties mightily, polyurethaning the floors, painting the walls, enhancing the plumbing -- all at their own expense.
"It's the story of the artist from the beginning of time," said Barbara Bordnick, a freelance photographer who now lives in her former studio at 39 East 19th Street. "We settle in decrepit areas, we improve the properties, then we get forced out."
Actually, Ms. Bordnick and many of her photographer colleagues tried hard to hang onto their studios for a time. As business slacked off, many tried to cover their rent or maintenance payments by charging the fashion houses or other studio clients an extra $250 or so for studio use. To their dismay, the clients balked at paying.
"The clients were furious, even though they paid as much as $1,000 a day to rent studios when they brought photographers in from out of town," Ms. Bordnick said.
One by one, she said, her friends were forced to give up their studios. Ms. Bordnick's building, a co-op that was once primarily photographers' and artists' studios, is now primarily residential. And the residents include lawyers and doctors and city officials as well as photographers.
Not all photographers have been victimized by the area's new panache. Some have benefited. Mr. Dezer, who bought 6 West 20th Street several decades ago, converted the eight-story building to a co-op in the early 80's, selling the floors for $40,000 to $75,000.
"SOME of the photographers bought their lofts, resold them for $700,000 and went fishing," Mr. Dezer recalls.
Today there are four photographers in the building. They coexist with a recording studio, a lighting-company showroom, a graphic-arts studio and a publishing house. The building's retail space, which once housed a photography store, now sells furniture.
Those photographers who have managed to hang in are renting their space out to others. Like most photographers, Nancy Brown, who owns her 5,000-square-foot studio at 6 West 20th Street, no longer has enough studio work to use it full-time, so she rents it to other photographers and for parties.
"I wouldn't have considered renting to others in the 80's," Ms. Brown said. "Now I'm getting so many calls I could make renting out my studio a full-time business."
Although most photographers report that the economic recovery is helping their business somewhat, few expect the photography district ever to return to its former glory. Computerized imaging, like computerized anything, need not be tied to any one location. And few photographers expect the growing trend toward on-location shoots or toward rental studios to abate anytime soon.
And perhaps most ominous for the area, SoHo and TriBeCa, which still have unconverted lofts available at relatively cheap rents, have wooed away many of the photographers and the labs.
Jonathan P. Switzer is the leasing agent for 568 Broadway, a building on Prince Street that saw a major influx of photographers' studios in the 80's, when lower Broadway rents were still comparatively cheap. In the first few years of the 90's many of them moved away, and nary a one moved in.
"My phone just stopped ringing," Mr. Switzer recalled.
Now the studios are renting up again. Marco Zambelli Studios took 3,200 feet last summer. Chalky Davies took about 2,800 feet a few months ago. Avanti Press, a catalog photographer, recently expanded from 3,600 square feet to more than 8,500. And business is picking up at SoHo Natural Light, a 3,000-foot-studio that rents itself out.
"SoHo is again the place for photographers to be," Mr. Switzer said.

A Whirlwind of Plans for a Hot Newtown Property

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES 

 BODY:
A PRIZED piece of property in the center of Newtown with almost 2 million square feet in 60 handsome brick buildings on an 800-acre campus has become a hotspot of contention among local and state officials and civic leaders.
Built in the 1930's as the Fairfield Hills state mental hospital, the now diverse operation is outmoded and its buildings are almost empty. But the grounds and buildings have been well maintained and are suitable for recyling to other uses. 
 Proposals for redevelopment on long-term leases from the state, which will maintain ownership, are being sought by a task force appointed by the General Assembly. Preliminary recommendations will be presented this month and in 1995 the legislature will decide what the new uses will be, based on the task force's findings.
Meanwhile, a deluge of proposals has poured in.
"I've been here for 36 years," said State Representative Julia R. Wasserman, a Newtown Republican who heads the 20-member task force, "and I've never seen this much material on one issue. We sent out requests for proposals six months ago and got almost 400 replies."
When the downsizing of the complex is completed next year, there will be 1.5 million square feet available in the buildings and about 500 acres of open space ready for redevelopment, according to Gary Mullaney, a task force appointee from the state's Department of Mental Health. The rest will be retained for existing substance-abuse and mental-health quarters for patients and staff, a minimum-security women's prison and to house the Second Company Governor's Horse Guards, a volunteer unit of the state militia involved mainly with ceremonial functions.
Three proposals among the many under consideration by the task force head the list:
* A major equestrian center for horse shows, submitted by the Newtown Bridle Lands Association and endorsed by the Connecticut Horse Council.
* A conglomerate of small produce farms and an incubator operation for developing and packaging food products, submitted by the state's Department of Agriculture.
* A research and development park, submitted by the Newtown Economic Development Commission.
All three projects are proposed for the only large tract of open land -- about 270 acres at the north end of the property.
Other proposals include a new elementary school to accommodate increased enrollments, housing for low- and moderate-income people, a golf course, soccer and ballfields, a larger Town Hall, and a community center. In addition, several state and local agencies have submitted requests for space.
"Newtown has an enormous horse population," said the First Selectman and task force member, Robert Cascella, "so the horse park is the most emotionally charged issue." There are 2,500 horses in the town of 20,700 residents.
"There is nothing like what we are proposing in the entire Northeast," said Kurt Schneider, chairman of the Newtown Bridle Lands Association, a land trust dedicated to riding trails and green-space preservation. "We could handle indoor-outdoor Olympic style three-day events rivaling those in Virginia, Kentucky and North Carolina, where they operate more than 300 days a year."
"It would boost tourism," he added, "creating a west-to-east swing through the state that would take a few days, instead of the shoreline pass-through that visitors do now, stopping briefly at the Norwalk Maritime Center and Mystic Seaport on their way to Massachusetts."
SINCE the Danbury State Fair grounds became a shopping mall in 1981 "the Connecticut Apaloosa, Morgan, Arab, Quarterhorse and Reining Horse Championships have all been held in West Springfield or Northampton, Mass.," said Richard Woolam, board chairman of the Connecticut Horse Council. "That's where all our money for food, lodging, gas, even laundry, goes. One cleaner did 1,900 shirts in five days."
"The Connecticut horse industry," said John J. Filchak 3d, Deputy Commissioner of Agriculture. "is one of the top five agricultural money-makers in the state, bringing in about $350 million out of the department's estimate of $1.7 billion annually."
The state is home to at least 18,000 horse owners and 60,000 horses. Despite this, Mr. Filchak is squarely behind the farming proposal, because, he said, "there are prime agricultural soils on that property that we are committed to preserve."
His agency supports a horse park "somewhere in Connecticut," Mr. Filchak said, "but the state is not convinced that private funding has been thoroughly explored."
Private equestrian centers have been informally proposed in the rural towns of Plymouth and Harwinton. But without support services, little local enthusiam and no financial underpinnings, such proposals do not seem promising.
In 1986 State Representative John Mordansky, Democrat of Stafford Springs, tried unsuccessfully to get state bonding for a horse park. A state study had indicated that in its first five years revenues from a major operation would rise from $2.08 million to $17.3 million annually.
Last year Mr. Mordansky sponsored another bill, requesting a $21 million bond issue to establish a horse park. Introduced after the biennial budget's bonding package was set, it passed the Environmental Committee unanimously, he said, "but the Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee would not reopen the package so it died." He will resubmit it when the Legislature convenes in January.
"In my opinion," he said, "Newtown has all the criteria to make a horse park successful -- access to highways, lodging, and restaurants.".
BUT, asks First Selectman Cascella, "would we lose control of the community if we became host for a large horse park, and which proposal will most benefit the town economically?"
"We could realize about $2 million a year in real estate taxes from a research and development park," added Elizabeth Stocker, the town's Community Development Director.
Because the proposed research and development park would abut the town's existing industrial park, the proposal has raised fears among detractors that additional companies would be hard to find and once found they could fail, shifting the tax burden onto homeowners.
Curtis Clark, managing editor of The Newtown Bee, called additional industrial activity "inappropriate on prime land in the center of town." The newspaper's editorial board and the majority of letters to the editor support the horse park, he said.
If the legislature is receptive to the Mordansky bill it could follow the precedent of Virginia, Kentucky and North Carolina, where horse parks have been financed by the states, and private nonprofit groups manage their operations.
"Private parks are not feasible," said Mr. Schneider, chairman of the Bridle Lands Association, "because of the land costs."
He cited as an example the privately developed Great Southwestern park outside Houston, which became the instrument of its own own destruction.
"Hotels, restaurants and support services grew up all around it," he said, "increasing the tax rate to a point where the park couldn't survive."

THE ECONOMY
 
May Unemployment: Good? Bad? You Figure It Out.
You want logic? Don't look at Friday's employment numbers. You'd think that if the rise in payrolls was tepid, the jobless rate would hold its own or even rise. But no: even as unemployment plunged to 6 percent in May (with the Northeast's rate falling to 6.3 percent from 7 percent), the lowest level since November 1990, payrolls rose just 191,000, far below expectations. The stock market had held its breath all week -- up a point, down a point -- waiting for this job signal, but then didn't know what to make of it. At first the Dow fell 16, as the market looked more at the jobless rate (a low rate could signal inflation). But then Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the President's top economist, said the rate might be a statistical fluke, and the market remembered the payroll number and rallied, ending up 13 for the day. But no one was sure what it all meant for the economy in general -- and Federal Reserve policy in particular. 

An Insurance Earthquake
The idea of insurance works fine if, as Oscar Wilde put it, events conform to what "statistics have laid down for our guidance." California's recent earthquake proved less cooperative. As the estimate for claims rose to $6 billion, insurers knew things would have to change. Now the shape of those changes is coming into focus: higher premiums, tougher guidelines and more companies simply wanting nothing to do with it -- "a crisis in the making" was one description. So just as many Californians have been jolted into seeking earthquake insurance, insurers are saying, No, there must be some other way -- like a Federal program to ease the pain.
 
Miracle on 59th Street?
What a difference a decade makes. In 1985 Mortimer Zuckerman agreed to pay $455 million to build a huge edifice on the New York Coliseum site. Last week, after endless wrangling, he agreed to buy just half the site from the M.T.A. The price? A mere $80 million -- plus $20 million the city will chip in -- for a prime piece of real estate (Columbus may be out of favor, but Columbus Circle certainly isn't). Of course, The Daily News, also owned by Mr. Zuckerman, endorsed Mayor Giuliani in November, and the Giuliani administration has pushed hard for a Coliseum deal, leading critics to see some mutual back-scratching. "Scurrilous attacks," said the Mayor. "We have viewed this on the merits."
 
Kudlow, Back in the Game
In the where-are-they-now vein, it should be noted that Lawrence Kudlow's exile from the brokerage world ended last week. Mr. Kudlow resigned in March as chief economist at Bear, Stearns, later acknowledging that he had a drug and alcohol problem. Soon after, he was named economics editor at National Review, at what could generously be described as a fraction of his former salary. And last week he stuck his toe back in Wall Street's waters by signing on as a very part-time consultant to Montgomery Securities. Asked about past problems, a Montgomery official said, "To the best of our knowledge he is cured."
 
Now Hoffenberg Wants a Deal
Steven Hoffenberg has apparently decided the Government has a mighty fortress of evidence against him. In February authorities scrapped a plea agreement with him, saying he had not met its terms. But last week it appeared that Mr. Hoffenberg wanted another chance at it. He's accused of using Towers Financial to defraud investors of hundreds of millions of dollars, and if convicted he'd face up to 25 years in prison. So a much lighter sentence clearly looks far better to him.
 
INTERNATIONAL
 
A Saudi Bet on Euro Disney
Citicorp and Euro Disney would seem to have nothing in common, but they've managed to find the same well-heeled friend. A few years back, Prince Walid bin Talal of Saudi Arabia saw a rosy future for the giant bank, invested $800 million and reaped a huge profit after Citicorp's fortunes rebounded. Now Prince Walid thinks he's found another lost soul waiting for his touch: Last week he agreed to invest up to $500 million in Euro Disney, whose fortunes have gone from bad to dismal. So those who have written off the French theme park as a culturally tone-deaf blunder may have to pause and weigh the possibility that one Saudi -- when it's this one -- can't be wrong.
 
Don't Count Japan Out
Don't write off the Japanese economy just yet. The nation's been stuck in recession for years, with each glimmer of hope quickly wilting. But a few crocuses have been pushing through lately, and this time they just might prove a prelude to spring. Last week several indicators pointed in a rare positive direction, and the Tokyo stock market has been plowing ahead -- it's up 20 percent this year and could soon hit a two-year high. One key factor: a strong yen has hurt badly, but now that the United States is starting to worry about a weak dollar, that could change.
 
COMPANIES
 
Cable TV, Alive and Well
The reports of cable television's death by regulatory strangulation were premature. Last week Cox agreed to buy Times Mirror's cable operations for a hefty $2.3 billion, to create the nation's No. 3 cable company. Cable stocks rallied, roused from the stupor brought on by the collapse of other deals this year.
 
Left Hand Clasps Right
It worked like this, Florida officials say: In the 80's, Humana owned both hospitals and health plans, and the left hand (health plans) negotiated big, secret discounts from the right (hospitals). But patients, they assert, saw no discounts. A patient paid, say, $200, thinking it was 20 percent of a $1,000 hospital bill. But the true bill was often far less -- possibly even less than $200, meaning the patient paid the whole thing. Humana admits no wrongdoing, but last week it agreed to pay $6.2 million, to 37,000 Florida customers, to settle the case. It had already gotten out of the hospital business; its hospitals are now part of Columbia/HCA Healthcare.
 
Pick a Number at IDB
Reporting earnings is not always the most precise of sciences; many numbers can have a variety of spins put on them. But there are limits, and Deloitte & Touche says IDB Communications went past them. Deloitte resigned recently as IDB's auditors, citing "questions concerning its ability to rely on management's representations"; when that news broke last week, IDB's share price was sliced in half. IDB, it seems, announced first-quarter results even after Deloitte raised a flag, then made changes that added $5 million to revenues but left profits unchanged. IDB says it could document the changes, but Deloitte quit before it could do so. So do top IDB executives have undying faith in their company? Well, three of them sold millions of dollars in stock in the last year.
 
When Leased Cars Pile Up
Leasing has taken off, and car makers love it: they can move those new models quickly. Now that golden egg is coming home to hatch, and what's popping out is more used cars than dealers can handle. But many buyers hear "used car" and think, "What if it's a lemon?" What to do? Cadillac was one that badly needed an answer, because it now leases half its new cars, up from 22 percent in 1991. So Cadillac's latest answer is to make used cars less threatening by extending warranties -- from four years or 50,000 miles to six or 70,000. Now G.M. must certainly hope it isn't the one stuck with lemons.
 
At Bell Labs, Just Science
AT&T Bell Labs is known for sticking to science, for calling a chip a chip -- and damn the political torpedoes. Last week it gave a vivid display of independence, as a Bell Labs scientist disclosed that he'd discovered a flaw in AT&T's "Clipper" chip, which has been billed as a device that would allow authorities to eavesdrop on coded computer transmissions. The trouble is, AT&T was envisioning a multimillion-dollar business in these chips -- especially if the Administration makes the technology a national standard -- and this could throw a wrench into that plan. So there was some internal soul-searching about disclosure, but the truth came out.
 
(Mixed) Smoke Signals
The group is called Californians for Statewide Smoking Restrictions. You'd be excused for guessing that it's pushing for, well, more smoking restrictions. Wrong. Put together by Philip Morris, the group backs a measure that would actually weaken many local anti-smoking laws by replacing them with a softer statewide law. And last week, state election officials cried foul at the way the group got people to sign a petition to get the measure on the ballot, charging that its canvassers identified themselves as people seeking to ban smoking, mischaracterized the petition and did not disclose that Philip Morris was backing it. The group's response: the accusation is obviously "politically motivated."

In Britain, It's Stiff Upper Lip Time

BYLINE: By Richard W. Stevenson 

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
IT all looked so rosy just a few months ago. Market strategists were almost unanimous in predicting that British stocks would continue their long climb throughout 1994, driven by steadily improving corporate earnings, falling interest rates and a stream of investment from abroad, particularly the United States.
Reality has proven considerably less pleasant. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading shares has fallen nearly 15 percent since its peak in February of 3,520.3. The London market, Europe's largest, closed out last week at 2,997.8. The market gained 17 points on Friday and 48.9 points on Thursday. But those performances were rare bright spots in what has been a grim three-month slide in both stock and bond prices here. 
 And while analysts still see sound fundamentals that could help the market turn around later in the year, there is little hope for improvement in the next few months.
So what went wrong? All fingers point to the United States. The decision by the Federal Reserve in February to begin raising interest rates drastically changed investment psychology on both sides of the Atlantic. Signs of inflation in the United States, analysts reasoned, inevitably meant that inflation, and rising rates, would soon begin biting in Britain, where the economic cycle has lagged just a year or so behind the American cycle.
"The move in interest rates by the Fed has brought forward a lot of concerns on inflation in the U.K. that otherwise would have taken 12 to 18 months to impact on the economy," said Robert Buckland, a strategist at Natwest Markets in London.
Moreover, rising rates led to a quick slowdown, and maybe even a reversal, of the flow of investment funds out of the United States and into Europe, where returns had been higher. The result was less demand for stocks, and falling prices.
The fall in the London stock market has been broadly mirrored by declines in the Paris and Frankfurt markets, where investors also see a two-year period of falling interest rates coming to an end.
"Right now we're fairly pessimistic in the near term about the prospects in the U.K.," said Marcus Grubb, the international equity strategist at Salomon Brothers in London. "The consensus view of the first part of the year has been proved wrong. There may be some value opportunity in the U.K. late in the year, but I fear the market could go lower first."
Mr. Grubb said many investors are nursing losses and do not have cash to put back into the market. He said the market is also likely to be spooked again over the summer if the Federal Reserve raises rates in the United States once more -- a prospect that seemed increasingly likely after Friday's report of strong job growth, a harbinger of inflationary pressures.
Salomon Brothers predicted in February that the London market could reach 3,950 by the end of the year. Now, Mr. Grubb said, it could still reach 3,600 if corporate earnings show the solid growth expected of them.
"In terms of timing, it's all going to come in the late third and fourth quarters," Mr. Grubb said, "because you're not going to get a handle on earnings until then and the lack of cash flow will be a drag on the markets throughout the summer months."
Mr. Buckland said both the stock and bond markets appear to have overreacted to economic conditions. Bond yields in Britain are at levels that assume inflation is heading back up to around 4.5 percent from around half that now, he said. Dividend yields on equities, at 4 percent, are nearing their average levels from the 1980's, he said.
The market's expectations of surging inflation, according to Mr. Buckland, are not reflected in the operating experience of companies in Britain. Most big industrial companies are scrambling to cut costs, and consumer companies are finding it difficult to pass along prices increases because consumers simply stop buying when product prices go up.
"Companies are telling me they don't want to chase market share, they want to protect margins by cutting costs," Mr. Buckland said. "Unless you start seeing them pushing prices up, its hard to see inflation going back to 1980's levels."
Even without a reignition of inflation, though, analysts said it may be hard to lure buyers back into the market. One ray of hope could come from the market for government bonds, or gilts, which are now widely viewed as undervalued. A rally in the bond market, they said, could induce enough investor confidence to send equities up as well.
"Just as the markets overshot on the upside early in the year, they could overshoot on the downside now," Mr.Buckland said. "In the short term it's going to be tricky. But when the markets do turn it's going to happen quickly."
Among the hardest hit equities over the last few months have been the interest rate-sensitive financial stocks, like banks.
Mr. Grubb said there may be value in a few bank stocks, such as National Westminster Bank. But he said that given the nervous market sentiment, cyclical stocks would be a better bet.
Mr. Grubb said Salomon likes chemical companies like BOC Group, and capital goods and building stocks like BTR, Tarmac and Hanson, all of which can benefit not just from Britain's slow but steady economic growth but from continental Europe's incipient upturn as well.

HEADLINE: Competition and Telecommunications

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Since the breakup of the old Bell System, the seven regional Bell operating companies have tripled in size to an aggregate market capitalization of $140 billion. Overly generous regulators have allowed the Bells to increase their rates of return to levels that are twice as high as long-term interest rates. Yet, the Consumer Federation of America says that in 1992 alone, the Bells managed to overcharge customers by $5 billion. 
 The hope behind this regulatory generosity was to give the monopolies greater incentives to invest in their core local networks. Where did the money go? Mostly into investments that had nothing to do with the Bells' principal obligation to provide local service. In fact, for every $1 of net new investment in the local network, the Bells have invested $13 in nontraditional activities. Their spending on the local telephone network has actually declined over the decade from 80 percent of cash flow, to 65 percent.
Now comes yet another study examining the Bells' announced plans to finally upgrade their local networks and pave the last mile from the information superhighway to America's homes. But the consumer federation and groups like the N.A.A.C.P. and the National Council of La Raza have accused the regional Bells of engaging in "electronic red-lining" by focusing only on affluent neighborhoods.
Any monopolist under attack will try to deflect attention by striking out at other parties. And so, through Kenneth G. Robinson, a hired consultant and lobbyist, the Bells have lashed out at AT&T, MCI and Sprint, accusing them of being cozy competitors.
In fact, while Americans are reaping the benefits of competition in long distance, including huge investments in new technologies and huge improvements in call quality, they enjoy none of these benefits with regard to local telephone services. A decade after the breakup of the AT&T, the regional Bells still control close to 100 percent of their local service markets.
Congress is considering legislation that will revamp telecommunications policy. MCI can't support anything less than full competition in all markets. We will welcome the regional Bells into long-distance services -- as long as they give up their monopolies first. But until that happens, they can and will take unfair advantage of their stranglehold on the local market to abuse customers and competitors.

HEADLINE: Tell Them New York's Back in Business

 BODY:
To the Editor:
After nearly a decade of wrangling, the New York Coliseum site will finally be developed. This is good news for the city, for the Metropolitan Transit Authority and for the construction and real estate industries.
Under the deal, the M.T.A. will receive $124 million for the property -- more than double the most recent appraised value of $57.5 million. Boston Properties will put up $80 million in cash. The company has agreed to pay immediately a $17 million nonrefundable down payment for the site, where it will build a million-square-foot office building, with retail stores. 
 Boston Properties will also cover $3 million estimated for upgrading half of the parking garage retained by the M.T.A., will contribute half the projected $6 million in mandated subway improvements and pay $2.5 million for having the office building separated from the exhibition hall. The company will even reimburse legal fees, estimated at $500,000.
The city will contribute $2 million a year of the $10 million to $12 million in annual tax revenues from the project to the M.T.A. Over the years this will total $20 million.
Often the city has encouraged development with incentives to the developer. The Dinkins administration properly encouraged The New York Times to keep its new printing plant in the city, with benefits to The Times of $29 million. In the Coliseum deal, the $20 million will be paid to the M.T.A., not Boston Properties. The M.T.A. will use the funds for the subways -- a benefit to the public.
The M.T.A. will also enjoy a 20 percent part in the growing value of a building appraised at $15 million in today's dollars. The M.T.A. half of the site will grow in value as well.
This project will be the first major office construction since the local recession began -- creating 3,700 local jobs. It sends a powerful message to the country and the world -- New York City is back in business.
To those who argue that the city should have tried for a better deal: This agreement makes an unused site economically viable, helping revitalize the entire Columbus Circle area; the city will reap tax revenues of $10 million to $12 million a year; jobs will be created, and New York City will acquire a tangible symbol of economic optimism.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
A Whole Nation More Agitated Than Spike Lee

BYLINE: By WARREN HOGE; Warren Hoge was the New York Times bureau chief in Rio de Janeiro from 1979 to 1983.

 BODY:
ON the hammered bronze door of the ornate palace that houses the archdiocese of Rio de Janeiro, a hand-written sign announced that no business would be conducted whenever the national team took the field.
It was the eve of the World Cup, and in the most populous Catholic nation on earth, even urgent matters of the spirit would have to find their resolution on the soccer pitch. 
 That was 1982, and Brazil, arguably the most soccer-besotted country on earth, was about to enter the faith-inspiring enchantment that every four years seizes almost all the world except the United States, where the competition is being played this year for the first time.
Despite a loss that year that amounted to a national calamity, faith endures as Brazil awaits the beginning of another World Cup. The Pontifical Catholic University in Rio just announced that it is compressing its school year by two weeks to enable students and faculty to leave campus and be by their television sets on June 20. That's the day Brazil faces Russia in its opening game in Palo Alto, Calif.
Brazilians have won the cup three times since the games began in 1930, and were there a trophy for national distraction induced by the event, they would have won that one even more often.
North Americans may think they know what a serious case of the sports loonies feels like, but the disease flares up only in selected times and places (see New York, Vancouver or Indianapolis in the present tense) or in selected individuals (see Spike Lee razzing the Pacers' Reggie Miller at Madison Square Garden).
A country's passion for its team at World Cup time puts the entire nation on the couch.
And so it will when the monthlong competition opens in Chicago next week. Like the Olympics, the World Cup comes around every four years, but the patriotic outpouring is greater. For many countries, particularly those in the third world, it's a chance to gain recognition in competition with world powers.
At home, soccer is a subject that unites people of vastly different social and economic conditions, producing more popular unity and pride that any political leader ever has. Individually, a fan's identification with a player comes more easily when the game is the familiar activity of street corners, sandlots and playgrounds. This strong personal association and a heady dose of nationalism make for an explosive brew.
Losses in cup games have brought on suicides, attacks on embassies and death threats against lapsed heroes. An elimination match between El Salvador and Honduras in 1969 provided the final antagonism in a series of misunderstandings that led to an armed conflict still referred to as the Soccer War.
Matches attract throngs -- Rio's Maracana Stadium seats 200,000 -- and the mood of a South American crowd is usually buoyant. There have been notorious cases of rioting and stampeding, some with fatalities, but in South America, as opposed to some European countries, the cause has been loss of crowd control rather than any organized thuggery.
This year's team is said to be the best Brazil has fielded since 1982, and the country is building up to the great moment in the same dizzily obsessive way that it did the last time it went into the games as a favorite.
Pennants, banners and streamers in the green and yellow national colors were draped from one building top to another across virtually every city street. Block-long cartoon figures of individual players stretched from intersection to intersection of every avenue. Residents stockpiled firecrackers to commemorate Brazil's goals.
"The nation pauses," the late Brazilian playwright Nelson Rodrigues wrote of this period, "all of it. Robbers don't rob, ghosts don't haunt, no crimes, no embezzlements, no deaths, no adulteries."
Indeed, when residents gathered anxiously before television sets transmitting the games from Spain, Rio fell into a hush extraordinary for a city United Nations studies had found to be the world's noisiest.
A state ecology official in Rio recorded decibel levels equal to predawn hours as the Brazilians' first game began, and lower yet when an opposing player opened the scoring. By the time the Brazilians' come-from-behind victory was secure and fans had taken to the streets in carnival, the cacophony registered on the meter surpassed that of a pneumatic drill tearing open asphalt.
The archdiocese wasn't alone in closing business down. "Only after the cup" is the common measure of time for decision-making; bankers have estimated that the idle time has cost the country more than $3 billion in lost production each cup year.
Brazilian soccer pleases with its emphasis on showy ball handling and precision lateral passing. The Brazilians call their soccer "alegre" -- happy. It's high on technique, dexterity and sheer dazzle, and the metaphors most commonly used to describe it come from dance, which Brazilians are really good at, too.
The style is emblematic of the national persona: a high regard for resourcefulness that appears effortless and full of grace, and a stylish cunning that passes for high art. The bond between a fan and his team is so direct and total that no distancing preposition interferes in the Portuguese statement declaring one's loyalty: "I am Flamengo" or "I am Vasco," the committed state. Many go to their graves in coffins wrapped in their team colors.
Soccer long ago conquered Brazilian syntax. The word used in everyday speech to describe the Brazilian bent for finding ways around obstacles is "driblar."
Their skill has made Brazilian players valuable to teams in Europe that can pay far more than any local club can. Brazil managed to keep its most famous player, Pele, by declaring him a national treasure and forbidding his export during his prime years, but today almost all the Brazilian stars play professionally outside the country. At a game between two Italian teams a few years ago, all the goals were scored by Brazilian players.
The wearers of the yellow and green back in 1982 brought ecstasy to their fans with their signature balletic soccer through the first four games of the competition. Then they lost, ending their expected march to the title.
The nation promptly went into mourning. In the northern city of Fortaleza, a 20-year-old man put a revolver to his head and killed himself. Hospitals reported a rash of coronary cases.
Samba bands that had assembled to take to the streets in celebration packed up all but their deep-timbred bass drums. These they used to beat out a funereal cadence as fans around the country staged mock burials of their team.

HEADLINE: Iraq Played 'Catch Me if You Can.' North Korea Says, 'What if You Do?'

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
IT used to be that the world's great powers worried that some renegade country -- Saddam Hussein's Iraq, for instance -- might sneak a nuclear bomb past the prying eyes of international monitors and spy satellites.
Then came North Korea, which has presented a whole new threat to the guardians of nuclear nonproliferation. North Korea is not simply trying to cheat. It is ripping up the rule book and challenging the world to do something about it. 
 It is the first nuclear crisis of the post-cold war world: At a time when the old rules of international order have been cast aside and entire nations have been ripped apart by ethnic strife, North Korea has stalled, thwarted or otherwise defied international nuclear inspectors and ignored warnings, coaxing and threats from Washington.
Last week an ominous new threshold was crossed when the United Nations' nuclear watchdog agency formally concluded that it could no longer determine whether spent fuel removed by North Korea after its nuclear reactor at Yongbyon was shut down in 1989 had been diverted to a secret weapons program. If unchallenged, North Korea's recalcitrance could destroy the credibility of the 1970 Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, the world's principal tool for preventing the spread of nuclear weapons.
"It is the first time that a country first signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, worked to develop nuclear weapons while a member and then openly defied the demands of international inspectors," said Gary Milhollin, director of the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control, a Washington-based research institute.
 
Attention, Libyans
 Clinton Administration officials acknowledge as much, and say that is one reason President Clinton announced last week that the United States would try to mobilize support for global economic sanctions. The aim is not just to persuade North Korea to abandon its bomb program, which Washington fears could trigger an arms race in Asia. It is also to send signals to Libya, Iraq, Iran and other potential nuclear powers that they cannot ignore the controls that the treaty imposes on them.
"We have made no secret of our concerns about the nuclear intention of such countries as Libya, Iraq, Iran," said Robert Gallucci, the Clinton Administration's point man on the North Korea question. "All three of these countries are nonproliferation treaty members."
The stakes are so high, the officials say, that the pressure of sanctions is necessary even though the North Koreans say their imposition would be an act of war. But it remains unclear whether China will support sanctions in the United Nations Security Council, which sanctions might be approved and what the North Koreans would have to do to get them lifted.
The nonproliferation treaty, which comes up for renewal in 1995, codified this basic bargain: Major nuclear powers -- the United States, the Soviet Union and Britain, which joined the treaty in 1970 -- would keep their nuclear arsenals. France and China agreed to join the treaty in 1991. Non-nuclear nations joining the agreement would receive assistance in developing nuclear energy for peaceful uses. In return, they would promise not to develop nuclear weapons. The arrangement would be monitored by inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency.
From the start, the treaty had its limitations. One major problem was that some emerging nuclear powers simply refused to be part of the deal.
India and Pakistan, at odds over Kashmir and deeply distrustful of each other's intentions, never signed the accord and are assumed to have small nuclear arsenals. During the summer of 1990, American intelligence agencies became concerned that south Asia might become a nuclear flashpoint and issued a classified warning that there was a "50-50" chance of a new Indian-Pakistan war.
Concerned that the two nations will soon escalate their arms race by fielding new surface-to-surface missiles, the Clinton Administration has launched a diplomatic effort to cap their nuclear weapons programs. But Strobe Talbott, the Deputy Secretary of State, was rebuffed when he sought to press the Administration's initiative during a recent trip to the area.
Israel, which has a small nuclear arsenal, also has not signed the treaty. That has been a worry, not because the United States believes Israel may launch a nuclear strike, but because it fears that Arab nations will cite Israel's stance to justify their own bomb programs.
A second major problem was making sure nobody cheated.
Iraq's ability to elude the agency's inspectors, in particular, was a black stain on the accord. Iraq signed the treaty and allowed inspectors to visit its reactors. Then it mounted a secret program to make highly enriched uranium for nuclear weapons, using an antiquated technology pioneered decades ago by the United States.
The full extent of Iraq's nuclear efforts became clear only after the Persian Gulf war, when defectors made their way out of Iraq. While some of Iraq's nuclear installations were bombed and United Nations inspectors dismantled others after the conflict, Iraq still has the scientists it needs to rebuild its nuclear-bomb program and could do so if sanctions were lifted and the United Nations inspections ceased.
Since the gulf war, the atomic energy agency has become more vigilant -- and with good reason. Iran has signed the nonproliferation treaty, but American officials believe that it is determined to develop nuclear weapons.
They say Iran is probably a decade or more away from building a bomb, but it could make faster strides if it managed to acquire nuclear material and scientists from the former Soviet Union and North Korea. Iran has important ties with North Korea, selling it oil in return for missiles and other weapons.
Libya, which has also signed the nonproliferation treaty, is farther behind. But it, too, has the money to buy bomb ingredients or scientific expertise.
International inspectors have also been keeping a watchful eye on Algeria, which purchased a small reactor from China and has also joined the nonproliferation treaty.
 
Foot-Dragging
 This is not to say that there have not been some successes. South Africa is the most notable case. Rather than hand over its nuclear weapons to a new black-majority government, the departing government of President F. W. de Klerk joined the nonproliferation treaty and dismantled its nuclear arsenal.
But that success has been overshadowed by the growing crisis in East Asia, where the atomic energy agency's new vigilance and the North Koreans' determination to have the bomb are producing a dangerous political standoff.
Like Iraq, North Korea seems to have calculated that the nonproliferation treaty would be a way to keep the West happy while it sought to develop nuclear arms.
North Korea joined the agreement in 1985 but dragged its feet on completing the technical agreement that covers inspections of its sites.
Meanwhile, its nuclear program continued apace. In 1989, it shut down its five-megawatt reactor at Yongbyon for three months. During that period, the Central Intelligence Agency believes, it removed enough plutonium for one or two nuclear bombs.
More recently, it has been working intensively on a second, larger reactor and expanding its plutonium-reprocessing capability. Pyongyang's decision last month to begin removing fuel from the Yongbyon reactor will give it enough plutonium to build four or five bombs once the fuel is reprocessed.
All of which has raised the stakes for the Clinton Administration, already under fire for a vacillating foreign policy. "I just don't think we can walk away from this," Mr. Clinton said in Rome last week.

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
Pick a Number, Any Number . . .

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
THE economy is growing a lot faster than expected. Or maybe it is growing much more slowly than thought.
Or maybe the numbers are just messed up. 
 There is something for everyone in the economic statistics from Washington. And never was that clearer, or perhaps we mean less clear, than it was Friday.
First, the good news. The unemployment rate dropped from 6.4 percent in April to 6 percent in May, far below any forecast. The report, President Clinton was quick to say, "clearly supports the wisdom of the economic strategy we have been following."
Unfortunately, there was more. The Government also said that just 191,000 new jobs were created last month, a lot fewer than anyone had expected. If that's right, the economy is weaker than thought.
How can such clearly incompatible figures coexist? The answer is that they are based on different surveys, each with its own inaccuracies. The unemployment figure comes from a household survey, which asks people whether they worked in the previous week and whether they were looking for work. The number of jobs comes from a survey of employers. Add in seasonal adjustments that probably are flawed, and the numbers could mean anything.
If nothing else, the numbers produced wild times for bond traders. If the economy is as strong as the 6 percent figure indicates, then inflation fears are likely to be rekindled and the Federal Reserve is likely to try to push up interest rates even more than it already has. So when the 6 percent headline flashed on news tickers, everybody wanted to sell bonds. Prices plunged, and the yield on 30-year Treasury bonds rose from around 7.3 percent to over 7.4 percent.
But within a few minutes, sentiment began to turn as the report on job totals came in. Bond prices rose, and by the end of the day the yield, which falls as prices rise, was back down to 7.26 percent.
All of which proved only that those who rely on quick readings of complicated and flawed economic reports can lose a lot of money very quickly.
And where is the economy really going?
Wait a bit. The Government will have more numbers this week, including figures on inflation and on how much money Americans are borrowing.
Maybe the new set of numbers will make some sense. But don't bet on it.

On the Internet, Dissidents' Shots Heard 'Round the World

BYLINE: By PETER H. LEWIS 

 BODY:
POLITICAL dissidents of all nationalities are discovering a homeland in the worldwide web of computer networks known as cyberspace.
Five years ago today, Chinese dissidents used facsimile machines to call world attention to the Government's violent crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in Tiananmen Square. Today, many human rights activists are exploring an even more powerful medium, the computer web called the Internet, as a way of defying censorship. 
 Human-rights organizations have been embracing electronic mail as a means of communicating with their members around the world. And just last week, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights and the writers group PEN were among the groups that met in New York to explore the possibility of establishing a human rights communications system over the Internet.
"As more and more people have access to the Internet, it will be practically impossible for governments to ban something," said Siobhan Dowd, who is the program director of the Freedom to Write committee of PEN.
There are places on earth that the Internet cannot reach, and in countries where the flow of information is no problem, copyright laws sometimes are. But already, the writings of dissidents and political prisoners are circulating on the Internet, which connects more than 20 million people worldwide.
An unusual library opened its electronic doors two weeks ago with a catalogue that so far consists entirely of excerpts from two books banned in the authors' home countries. "I was 16 when the Cultural Revolution broke out in 1966," one of them begins.
These words from the autobiographical manuscript "Searching for the Truth," by the Chinese dissident Wei Jingsheng, along with excerpts from the book "This Earth of Mankind," by the Indonesian novelist and dissident Pramoedya Ananta Toer, are the first in what could become a global repository of banned and censored writing, distributed freely over the Internet. Some of the work of Esmail Fassih, an Iranian diarist, is to go on line this week.
None of the authors have access to the Internet, as far as anyone in cyberspace can tell. There are no Internet host computers in Beijing, where Mr. Wei, having been imprisoned for years and finally released, was recently placed under house arrest after speaking to Western journalists about human rights in China. Nor is Mr. Toer on line in Indonesia, where he has been barred from leaving the country and his activities are said to be closely monitored. But the new electronic library, which is called the Digital Freedom Net, demonstrates the Internet's power in opening pathways around government censors.
The Digital Freedom Net was established by Howard Jonas, whose company, International Discount Telecommunications of Hackensack, N.J., provides long-distance telephone and Internet service to businesses. The excerpts on the network are accessible to anyone in the world with a personal computer, a modem, a telephone line and a way to tap into the Internet.
Compared with the uncoordinated, small-scale use of facsimile machines by dissidents in China and the former Soviet Union, the rapidly growing Internet holds the promise of great speed and scope.
Messages travel from one Internet site to another, even around the world, in seconds. It is as easy to post messages to thousands, or even hundreds of thousands, of users as it is to send a single fax. Once retrieved, it can be passed on to other computer networks or by more conventional means. And because information travels in "packets" of data that are typically scattered and reassembled at the receiving site, it is much harder to intercept or trace messages.
"The notion of using the Internet to transcend international boundaries that have been used to suppress information is a very visionary one," said Gara LaMarche, associate director of the Human Rights Watch, an international human rights monitoring organization based in New York.
But Ms. Dowd of PEN, and others, have practical concerns about the Digital Freedom Net, including the mechanism for deciding which works would be included, and the fact that most censored publications require translation. Not the least of Ms. Dowd's concerns is rights and royalties. "Putting things up on the Internet without getting copyright permission wouldn't be right," she said. "We are a writers group, after all."
Ms. Dowd cited as an example Salman Rushdie's novel "Satanic Verses," which was banned in several Islamic countries but published commercially elsewhere. "Putting it up freely on the Internet could take away the market," she said.
Before posting the excerpts from "The Earth of Mankind," the Digital Freedom Net received permission from Mr. Toer's publisher, William Morrow in New York. But Mr. Wei's manuscript, which was has never been formally published, was made available to the Hackensack computer by the Index on Censorship, a London-based group that had printed the excerpts in the organization's magazine -- without the writer's authorization but on the assumption that he had permitted the manuscript to be smuggled out of China in order to share it with the world.
Still, skeptics wonder about the practical reach of Internet communication, since the computers capable of tapping into it are concentrated in North America and Europe.
"If something is banned in Bangladesh, putting it on the Internet wouldn't help because most people in Bangladesh don't have computers," Ms. Dowd said.
But Mr. Jonas, the network's founder, said: "It's the business leaders and intellectual groups in universities, where opinion is made, where people in those countries have access to the Internet. The information will get through, unless a government is willing to close down every school and every business that has an Internet account."
John S. Quarterman, an Internet consultant and author in Austin, Tex., said approximately 60 countries and territories have Internet connections capable of tapping directly into the Digital Freedom Net, which is known as a "gopher" site. Gopher is a navigational tool for streamlining the search for information on the Internet.
But dozens of other countries without such sophisticated Internet capabilities can gain indirect access to the information, which can be relayed by the less complicated system of electronic mail. Mr. Quarterman says more than 40 million computer users worldwide can exchange E-mail. Using his computer keyboard to explore the Internet's backwaters, Mr. Quarterman found only one site in Africa between Cairo and Cape Town, and no sites in Iran. In all of China he has found only one, a commercial venture in Shanghai.
"Networking is subversive, and that's why the Chinese don't want it," Mr. Quarterman said.
But he added that there might be some electronic exchange across the Chinese border -- "given the changing political tide and economic conditions, especially Hong Kong." He also noted that Internet traffic into and out of Vietnam has surged since the United States lifted its trade embargo.
The Digital Freedom Net goes beyond basic electronic mail by storing files that can be read, copied and printed. (The Internet address is "gopher.iia.org" for those with the gopher tool.)
There is no charge beyond the user's own Internet fees, and Mr. Jonas said all material posted to the library would be selected by reputable human rights groups.
Mr. Jonas, who is 37 years old, said his company was donating the computer space and phone lines, and that many of his employees were volunteering their time, often well into the night, to maintain the library. "We wanted to use technology to do something great," he said, "like eliminate censorship."

HEADLINE: 'Last Rain Forest:' Timber vs. a Culture -- A special report.;
In Isolation, Papua New Guinea Falls Prey to Foreign Bulldozers

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PORT MORESBY, Papua New Guinea

 BODY:
Hidden in the lush vastness of the rain forests of Papua New Guinea, there is a land that time forgot. It is a place so untouched by the outside world that many of the forest-dwellers here still wear bird feathers and grass skirts, use shells and pigs' teeth for money and remember not-so-distant relatives who celebrated victories over their tribal enemies by eating them.
Papua New Guinea has been described by conservationists as the last rain forest, and it is not much of an exaggeration. This remote Pacific country is carpeted by some of the last extensive stretches of pristine tropical forest anywhere. 
 But even the "last rain forest" is now in danger. The forests of Papua New Guinea -- and a way of life they have sheltered since the Stone Age -- are threatened by a stampede of foreign loggers desperate for new sources of tropical timber. Environmentalists say the timber with commercial value here could be felled within a generation, possibly within a decade.
 "They use the bulldozer to make a road to bring the trees down to the sea, and they come right through our land," said Vincent Mutumutu, pointing to the new logging road that stretches down the mountain behind his village, a huge brown scar slicing through the dense 100-foot-high canopy of walnut and Borneo mahogany trees. "The loggers do not think about the life of the people here."
Mr. Mutumutu does not know exactly how old he is. All he knows is that he was born before "the big fight," otherwise known as World War II, the only event that linked the people of these majestic forests to the modern world.
But if Mr. Mutumutu and his neighbors lost track of the 20th century, it is fast catching up to them. Late last year, a bulldozer owned by a foreign logging company came crashing into Mr. Mutumutu's tiny farm of banana trees and watermelon vines, destroying the only source of income for his family of 16.
"I do not know what I will do now," said Mr. Mutumutu, adjusting and readjusting his lap-lap, the ragged piece of cloth tied around his waist, the only item of clothing that he has ever worn or, for that matter, ever needed.
 
The Land
Viewing Trees In Different Ways
 Eighty percent of Papua New Guinea is covered by trees -- 145,000 square miles of tropical forest, nearly equal to the size of California, spread across an archipelago of 600 islands at the point near the equator where Southeast Asia spills into the South Pacific. The western half of main island is occupied by Irian Jaya, a province of Indonesia.
With only four million people, Papua New Guinea is among the most sparsely populated countries, and many of the tribes have been isolated from their neighbors for centuries.
This is a paradise for linguists, since there are more than 700 distinct languages, a fifth of the languages known on earth. Pidgin English is the national language, and the expression "happy noon" is a national greeting.
The loggers see a paradise of a different sort. The forests are thick with hardwood trees, including walnut, mahogany and pine, and the logging companies describe a resource worth billions of dollars in a world market starved for tropical timber.
 
Malaysian Logging Companies
 The largest foreign logging companies operating here come from Malaysia, which has already sacrificed much of its own rain forest to rapacious logging.
Evidence of the loggers' work is increasingly easy to find. Some logged areas here resemble moonscapes, with so much of the vegetation and topsoil stripped away that the forests may never grow back. Conservation groups warn that the loss of such massive tropical forests could affect climatic patterns elsewhere in the Pacific.
Rare species of plants and animals have been put in danger; the variety of wildlife is among the most diverse on earth, including the world's largest butterfly and 38 of the 43 species of birds of paradise. Also endangered are some of the world's most ancient tribal cultures.
"This is a battle that pits people wearing loinclothes and bird feathers against fast-talking, fast-moving foreign loggers," said Tim Neville, the Forests Minister and the nemesis of the Malaysian loggers.
Max Henderson, an Australian-born environmentalist who has lived in Papua New Guinea for 30 years, says the loggers are engaged in a "magnificent con."
"The loggers turn up on a beach with a handful of money," he said, "and tell these gullible landowners, 'I'm here to help you if you let me just take down a few of these old trees.' And they leave the landowners with nothing."
 
Tribes Paid Fraction of Value
 Figures compiled by the Forests Ministry seem to support the charge. Government figures show that nearly $500 million worth of logs was shipped out last year. The payment to the tribes that actually own the forests was less than $15 million.
Loggers insist that no one is being cheated. They say their industry is creating wealth for a backward people whose wretched living conditions have always been ignored by their own Government.
"Our industry has a lot of contributions to make," said Francis Tiong, general manager of the largest of the Malaysian logging firms, Rimbunan Hijau, which translates from the Malay as Beautiful Forest.
"In remote rural areas of the country, we build roads, community halls, churches, schools, government offices," Mr. Tiong said.
But as they rake in huge profits, the loggers are creating for themselves a reputation for corruption and violence. The industry's critics say they have been the targets of death threats, or worse. Mr. Neville, the Forests Minister, says that since he announced a crackdown on foreign logging, he has twice been confronted by gun-wielding attackers. "My bloody neck has been on the line," he said.
 
The Logging Industry
The Social Battles Seem Very Uneven
 Only a few years ago, most foreign loggers did not want to do business in Papua New Guinea. It was not worth the trouble.
The terrain -- wide, raging rivers, jagged mountains, plunging valleys -- is treacherous, which helps explain why this former British and German colony was one of the last places in the Pacific to be conquered by European explorers.
The Germans were forced out during World War I, with the League of Nations handing control over to Australia, which also took over the British mandate. Papua New Guinea was granted full independence in 1975.
The terrain makes logging difficult, often impossible. Worse for the loggers, the laws in Papua New Guinea give ownership of the forests to the people who live in them, not to the Government, a situation that requires separate timber contracts for even the smallest tracts of forest.
But the loggers' attention turned back to Papua New Guinea in the 1980's, as Malaysia and other heavily forested countries in Southeast Asia and the Pacific barred the export of raw logs, hoping to preserve what was left of their ravaged woodlands. The result has been a rush of loggers into Papua New Guinea, one of the few countries that still permits the export of raw logs. (Papua New Guinea does not have the large sawmills needed to process the logs itself.)
 
Timber Prices Spur Cutting
 The pace of logging here has exploded along with prices on world markets. The price for the wood from a single tree of tropical hardwood has jumped from about $225 in the mid-1980's to nearly $600 today.
The amount of wood exported from Papua New Guinea has quadrupled since 1980, when 642,000 cubic meters of logs left the country. In 1992, 2 million cubic meters of logs was exported. The exports grew last year by more than a third, to 2.7 million cubic meters, equal to about 3 million trees, with most of the logs bound for wood-processing plants in Japan.
If the environmental stakes were not so high, the negotiations over lumber rights might be comical, with loggers venturing hundreds of miles into the dense forests to wave money at villages of illiterate, nearly naked forest-dwellers.
"These are bush people," said Helen Pilon, a social worker here whose job requires her to take daylong hikes into the jungle to explain the concept of logging rights to remote tribal villages. "They live in bush houses, with no power, with pit toilets, using dogs' teeth for money. For many of these people, the first time they ever see an outsider is when they meet a logger."
 
$24 a Tree to Villagers
 Honest loggers acknowledge that native villagers are easily cheated, and that tribes often sell their rights to millions of dollars' worth of trees for a pittance. The Government estimates that a village will receive about $24 for every tree taken from its forest, while the logging company will sell the tree for nearly $600 -- of which at least a third is profit.
A report prepared for the Government last year by an outside consultant found that "the customary landowners whose forests were logged have received nothing of substantial benefit -- indeed, have suffered long-term harm" as their forests are devastated.
While there are no exact Government estimates on the amount of deforestation, environmental groups say that even their most optimistic calculations show that the forests with commercial value will be gone within 20 years.
Mr. Henderson, the environmentalist, recently warned a local audience that "for those of you with new babies, there will be no accessible forests left by the time they are 21."
 
A Typical Village
The False Promise Of Development
 The people of the village of Sembam, whose ancestors survived in the forest for centuries with little but rock-sharpened spears and a hunger-inspired aptitude for hunting, thought that they would be rich by now.
They own thousands of acres of dense rain forest along the eastern coast of the island of New Britain, the largest of Papua New Guinea's offshore islands. In 1991 they sold off the rights to the forests -- trees that had sprouted in the time of their great-great-grandparents -- to a Malaysian-controlled logging company, Bismark Industries, in exchange for what the villagers say were promises of wealth and development.
But three years later, there is little development and no wealth, at least not among the villagers. And their ancestral home in the forest is being torn apart.
In the surrounding forests, the squawking chatter of flocks of hornbills and kingfishers is drowned out by the grinding buzz of chainsaws and the massive thud of hardwood trees striking the moist earth. Where once there had been dense vegetation, there is now a barren vista dotted with lonely tree stumps.
 
Topsoil Has Washed Away
 Without the trees to hold it in place, the topsoil has washed away, replaced by a gritty scarlet-colored mud that smears the rags that clothe most of the village children. The runoff has polluted nearby creeks once used for drinking water.
"We had nothing before the loggers come, and I think maybe we will have nothing when the loggers go home," said Nicholas Pius, 29, a cocoa farmer, digging his toes into the gooey mud on the path outside his family's home, a straw-roofed one-room wooden hut without running water or electricity. "Maybe when the loggers go, we will have nothing, because the forests will be gone."
A year and a half after the logging began, villagers say, each of them has received only 50 kina -- equivalent to $57, or slightly more than $14,000 for the entire village of about 250 people -- even though Bismark estimates that it has already removed about $3 million worth of timber.
A Methodist preacher in the village, Pastor Pendrick Libai, said the 50-kina payments had been distributed in April, and that most of the money had been spent within days. Much of it went for what are considered luxuries here, including canned meat and alcohol.
"I see a few men get drunk," he said. "Some people in the village are angry about the way that they have been treated by the loggers, but they have no guts to speak out. These people are new to the outside world. They have a fear of outsiders. They do not know how to complain."
 
Pacts Fulfilled, Manager Says
 Bismark insists that it has done nothing wrong. Tatsuo Fujino, the company's business manager, said the company had lived up to "every condition of our contract."
He said that while details of the logging agreement with the village were confidential, he could disclose that "much more" than 100,000 kina, or about $114,000, had been put into bank accounts under the control of the village elders.
"We recommended that they keep the money in the bank," he said.
Asked why most of the villagers had seen so little of the money despite their wretched living conditions, Mr. Fujino said that was not his business.
"I am not in a position to say this is fair or not fair," he said. "My duty is to follow to the agreement."
The contract, he acknowledged, also called for the logging company to build a new schoolhouse, three new first-aid stations and a permanent bridge. But so far only the school has been built, and it is a rickety open-air structure with only two classrooms and housing for two teachers. Mr. Fujino said the first-aid posts and the bridge would eventually be built.
 
The Consequences
How Corruption Can Bring Murder
 For years, the Government ignored its responsibility to police the logging industry. To understand how that happened, it takes only a quick trip -- and few visitors want anything more -- to the capital, Port Moresby.
Most of this country is lush with virgin forests, but Port Moresby is a dusty, dirty, charmless city so dangerous that a family's wealth is measured by the amount of barbed wire that rings its home.
Along every rutted road there is evidence of the inability of the nation's leaders to carry out even the most basic functions of government.
"This place makes the worst American city look like a picnic," said a Western diplomat, whose backyard is bordered with interlocking strands of razor wire and patrolled by a mean-spirited guard dog.
Gangs known locally as rascals, mostly unemployed young men who come here looking for work, roam the streets looking for victims. There are no reliable crime statistics, but murder and gang rape are common.
In 1989 a Government commission found that the logging industry was "out of control," both because of Government incompetence and because so many Government officials had been paid off by the logging companies. The report likened the loggers to "robber barons -- bribing politicians and leaders, creating social disharmony and ignoring laws."
 
Chief Investigator Attacked
 After the results of the investigation became known, the chief investigator, Tos Barnett, a judge, was attacked in the streets of the capital. The gang of unidentified men screamed, "Kill him! Kill him!" as they stabbed him with sharpened screwdrivers.
"I had stab wounds to my lungs, chest, legs, buttocks -- wherever they could stab me," Mr. Barnett said. He has suggested that the attack was organized either by logging interests or by politicians implicated by the investigation.
Mr. Neville, the Forests Minister, is widely admired among conservationists, and his appointment is the reason for the Government's new willingness to confront the loggers.
His national forestry plan, announced in increments over the last two years, would ban the export of logs and compel loggers to guarantee that they were involved in sustainable logging, and he appears to have the support of the Prime Minister Paias Wingti.
But Mr. Neville has also come under threat. Once, when he was driving from a Port Moresby hotel, he was confronted by a group of men wearing face masks and carrying pistols.
"They jumped out from the side and smashed in the windshield of the car," he said. "I put my foot on the accelerator and tore through them."
 
Had to Flee His House
 Two days later, several men drove up to the gate of his house at night with rifles. "Luckily the gate next door was open, and I went racing down my neighbor's driveway," he said. The car sped away.
"I was born in this country, and I've never, ever had any experiences like this before," he said. Mr. Barnett has occasionally sent his family out of the country to Australia for their safety.
Mr. Tiong, the Malaysian logger, said that allegations linking the foreign logging companies to violence were "ridiculous" and that death threats were "not our Malaysian culture."
He said that the Malaysians, like other foreign loggers, were living up to their contracts with landowning tribes, and that the tribes were eager to make deals, since the logging companies offered them their first chance for any sort of development.
"The resources in this country are owned by the landowners, and they have to decide for themselves whether they are happy," he said. "We think they are happy."
 
A Novel Approach
How One Village Learned to Benefit
 Ankle deep in thick red mud as he hikes beneath a canopy of trees so dense that no sunlight strikes the soil, George Metpes, 31, the tribal chief in the village of Arabam, leads an expedition into the heart of one of the world's last great rain forests.
As he goes, he explains how he hopes to save this isolated stretch of forest from the law of supply and demand.
Arabam is one of a handful of villages involved in sustainable-logging programs, in which local villagers chop down trees themselves but leave enough standing so the forest can grow back quickly.
The program is the brainchild of Mr. Henderson, the environmentalist. His organization, the Pacific Heritage Foundation, is trying to encourage local tribes not to give up their only resource to foreigners who care only about quick profits.
In the project with Mr. Metpes's village on New Britain island, several villagers are put to work for about $6 a day, a good wage, chopping down trees and then processing them into boards, which are shipped to a chain of English hardware shops that sell only "environmentally sensitive" lumber.
 
Preserving the Canopy
 The idea, explains Gary Thomas, a British forester who is overseeing the project for the foundation, is to preserve the thick canopy of trees, which provides the shade and moisture needed for the trees to grow back quickly. "Here, we can take the trees and still preserve the canopy," he said.
The difference between areas of sustainable forestry and clear-cutting is stark. Even where trees have been removed, there is still shade and the cool damp of the rain forest. Lizards scamper across the mud. The deep-throated hornbills and blue-eyed cockatoos are still in full voice here.
The problem for Mr. Metpes is that the money from this project does not match the money he would receive from foreign loggers if the village agreed to allow the clear-cutting of the forest. The tribal chief said that after a lifetime of deprivation, many of the older villagers want as much money as possible, even if that means the loss of the forest forever.
"It is always a struggle," he explained sadly. "Many of these people want fast money. Some of them have been so poor all of their lives that they have never eaten tinned meat. And that's what they tell me. They say that they want tinned meat before they die."

HEADLINE: Derailment On Wall Street -- A special report.;
Fallen Bond Trader Sees Himself As an Outsider and a Scapegoat

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR with DOUGLAS FRANTZ 

 BODY:
From the time he left a small town in Ohio to make his way through M.I.T., Harvard Business School and three Wall Street firms, Orlando Joseph Jett was the ultimate outsider, a fierce individualist who made few close friends and drove himself hard. And since mid-April, when Kidder, Peabody & Company accused him of orchestrating a $350 million fraud and dismissed him, placing him at the center of one of Wall Street's biggest scandals, Mr. Jett has been more isolated than ever.
For the first time since that scandal unfolded, Mr. Jett, 36, is speaking out about himself, his upbringing, his career on Wall Street and his ordeal at Kidder. Only months ago, he was Kidder's employee of the year -- a star trader who earned a $9 million bonus in 1993. Now he is unemployed, and under investigation by the United States Attorney's office in Manhattan and the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
 Many have speculated about how that fall took place. Mr. Jett offers no single answer. But in a four-hour interview with him last week, he kept returning to what it was like to be a black man in a largely white society, and how that has affected his career and his life. Some of his most biting stories underscored how even after he had gained entree into blue-chip institutions like the Ford Motor Company and Kidder, he still saw himself as invisible to others who counted.
Initially, the notion of a certain degree of invisibility appealed to him. He talked, for example, of the lure of Wall Street as a place where he would be judged not by the color of his skin, but by the amount of money he could make. "The government bond market is exquisitely objective," he said. "It cares nothing about a person's race, color or creed. Trading was the perfect job."
But he was reminded again and again that it was not entirely the case.
"It was sort of fascinating," he said, recalling how visiting Kidder salespeople sought to congratulate him after his promotion to chief of Kidder's government bond desk. He recounted how they would walk up to a colleague to offer congratulations, rather than to Mr. Jett himself. "It never entered their minds that I could possibly be Joe Jett," he said.
Mr. Jett craved recognition, and tried harder and harder to achieve the performance that would bring it. In the end, however, it was that performance -- the exceptional, but apparently phantom, profits he managed to show on the trading desk -- that brought about his downfall at Kidder.
Even as Mr. Jett reasserted his innocence in the interview at the office of his public relations adviser, a person outside of Kidder who is familiar with the investigations said Mr. Jett's scheme was something far larger than that described in Kidder's accusations.
According to this account, in the month before Mr. Jett was dismissed, his fictitious trades soared to a stunning $600 billion for March. But instead of concluding any of these trades, this person said, Mr. Jett rolled them over into new trades and counted the nonexistent profits as real.
 
 
A Huge Pyramid Scheme
 The person familiar with the investigations said the trading records and interviews with Kidder staff showed that Mr. Jett had engaged in a huge pyramid scheme involving nonexistent trades and ever-larger phantom profits. A month before his dismissal, his scheme had grown so huge that it was threatening to spiral out of control and this ultimately led to his downfall, this person said.
With the current investigations, Mr. Jett's lawyers would not allow him to discuss his trading in an interiew. Nonetheless, Mr. Jett disputed Kidder's charges against him and reasserted his belief that he has done nothing wrong. "I have to fight because I am innocent," he said. "I won't let them railroad me."
In the weeks since Kidder embarrassed itself and stunned the financial world by charging that Mr. Jett had outwitted its controls and auditing systems, the firm has recognized $350 million in losses that it has attributed to Mr. Jett and has opened itself to armies of outside investigators.
Mr. Jett, meanwhile, has assembled a team of lawyers -- including Kenneth E. Warner, a civil lawyer, Lewis D. Lowenfels, a securities specialist, and Gustave H. Newman, a criminal lawyer who recently represented Robert A. Altman in the B.C.C.I. case -- to free money from his Kidder accounts and to defend against any possible legal charges, though none have yet been filed.
 
 
Doing What He Was Told
 People familiar with Mr. Jett's situation contend that he was merely recording his trades the way he was told by his bosses to make Kidder's books look better for the benefit of prospective buyers and Kidder's parent company, the General Electric Company.
A Kidder spokesman has called this accusation "preposterous" and "defamatory."
 Mr. Jett's legal strategy has already borne some fruit: on Friday evening, Kidder gave Mr. Jett $138,181 from his deferred compensation account, though he is still seeking the remainder of the more than $8 million that he had in other Kidder accounts.
Even though Mr. Jett is now having his say, he says he feels that with General Electric and Kidder against him, he is facing a juggernaut. "After what has been done to me there is no room for truth," he said, shaking his head. "They've depicted me as a despicable character. The words have been twisted, and the truth turned merrily on its head."
 
A Midwest Upbringing
Brains and Brawn Of a Professed Nerd
 Sitting in the Third Avenue office of the public relations adviser, George Sard, Mr. Jett described last week his middle-class Midwest upbringing, the attraction of Wall Street and his ill-fated career at Kidder. Mr. Jett, dressed in a dark suit with a faint chalk stripe and a white shirt with a yellow-and-blue patterned tie and gold cuff links, sat with a military bearing, formal and composed, eager to tell his story. Although he is only 5 feet 7 inches tall, he is powerfully built, the result of years of bodybuilding.
During the interview, Mr. Jett sought to dispel the image of himself as a ruthless Gordon Gekko willing to do anything -- even cheat -- to make money or beat his rivals. In tones measured and sad at times, angry and scornful at others, he portrayed himself as a driven, dedicated employee who tried to light a fire under a lackluster trading department, made enemies along the way and wound up a scapegoat at least in part because he is black.
He described how as the son of a conservative black small-business man, he grew up a fan of Richard Nixon, worked in Ronald Reagan's 1980 Presidential campaign and disdained affirmative action programs so much that he refused to identify his race on his application to the Harvard Graduate School of Business Administration.
 Mr. Jett, who grew up in Wickliffe, Ohio, 14 miles northeast of Cleveland, arrived on Wall Street with the kind of background that seemed made for success. His mother, a science teacher, and his father, who sold insurance, stressed education and discipline to their three children. "My Dad pulled us out of team sports; he felt it was a trap," he said. "If we didn't get good grades, we were punished. When we did something wrong, he'd take a belt to us."
Mr. Jett's father, James, 64, who said he learned of the accusations against his son on the evening news, said, "We have every bit of confidence that this system works and we want the process to go forward."
"You don't get shook up just because someone is accusing your child," he said. "But when he is vilified and when his character is assassinated, when you have a Judge Thomas situation, when high-tech lynching is starting to occur, you get shook up."
Although he worked a paper route from about the age of 8, and as a dishwasher and cook at a steak house during high school, Joseph Jett was also an avid reader and a mathematics whiz who liked beating his older sister and brother at the flash cards his parents quizzed them on hour after hour.
"There's a beauty to math," Mr. Jett noted. "It's logical. It adheres to rules always."
Nancy Vieburg, a childhood friend who knew Mr. Jett through high school, shared his interest in math and science and has stayed in touch with Mr. Jett.
"It was not a real popular thing to be a brain in our high school," she said. "There was a point when he realized, it's a good thing to be smart."
 
No Money in Philosophy
 Even better than math, Mr. Jett said, was philosophy. But he said his father talked him out of majoring in philosophy by showing him the newspaper and saying, "Show me the help-wanted ads that say 'Philosopher.' "
 So Mr. Jett headed for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1976, where he earned bachelor's and master's degrees in chemical engineering, and later to Harvard Business School.
Even before he moved east, however, it was clear to Mr. Jett that he did not fit in, even with many of his fellow black students. Not only was he a professed nerd who did not speak black slang, but he sometimes seemed to go out of his way to challenge other blacks.
He tells the story, for example, of the time in the ninth grade, when he walked onto the basketball court in a local park and stole the ball. As he tells it, he climbed up on a bench and told the players, "It's time that we as a people stop making baskets and start making A's."
"I got beat up," he added, laughing.
Even when he attended a program for minority engineers at the University of Dayton in the 11th grade, he did not blend in. He recounts how the group had to take two I.Q. tests on the second day of class, a standard one and one that had racial bias removed.
"The psychologist told the class that all of them except one did poorly on the standard test, and that all except one did better on the racially corrected test," Mr. Jett said. "She identified me to the class."
 
 
Building Character and Body
 Mr. Jett says he developed a certain strength of character partly from his father and partly from the fact that he was picked on. To defend himself, he began lifting weights.
While college and graduate school were liberating experiences, socially and intellectually, Mr. Jett said, he found the working world by turns indifferent, stifling and, at times, hostile.
 
 
From Orlando to Joseph
 After graduating from M.I.T., he went to work for the General Electric plastics division in Selkirk in upstate New York. At General Electric, Mr. Jett abandoned his first name, Orlando, in favor of his middle name. "Orlando would never be called back," he said. "Joseph would be called back almost immediately."
It was also at General Electric that Mr. Jett, who wound up with far less responsibility than he wanted, decided that people skilled in management and marketing, not engineers, would be running things in the new corporate world. Since techies, as he put it, would "always be order takers," he decided to get an M.B.A.
Although he said he intended to return to General Electric, Mr. Jett was drawn at Harvard to students who had worked on Wall Street -- "They had the drive and the energy" -- and he got his first taste of trading in a summer job at Ford Motor, where he was part of the group that managed the company's short-term cash.
 
Rough Start in Finance
Personality Clashes At 3 Wall St. Firms
 Mr. Jett was determined to make his mark on Wall Street, but his initial experiences there were not encouraging.
His first job after graduating from Harvard was as a trainee and then as a junior trader at Morgan Stanley. He said he alienated colleagues and supervisors by turning "loud and brash" in an effort to fit in with other traders. After less than two years, he was laid off.
When he landed a second job, at CS First Boston, after being unemployed for six months, Mr. Jett said he was careful to present a new persona. "I felt I simply could not allow a personality," he said. "I became very dry. My God, did I become a dry, quiet, dull person."
Former colleagues at First Boston said Mr. Jett was dismissed in early 1991, partly for poor performance and partly for inflating his resume, including overstating his experience at Morgan Stanley. But he said he was let go after the firm discovered he was looking for work at Kidder.
Mr. Jett said that he had a "handshake agreement" to join Kidder in early 1991, but that the deal fell apart after he lost his job at First Boston. Six months later, Mr. Jett landed a job as a bond trader on Kidder's government desk.
But within six months, Mr. Jett said, he was in danger of failing again and losing what he considered "the dream job." Despite a regimen of 12-hour days and much study at home after hours, Mr. Jett received a warning at year-end that he would have to become more profitable or face dismissal, according to two people familiar with his record. His bonus that year was $5,000 -- a pittance by Wall Street standards and practically an invitation to start looking for work elsewhere.
 
 
Driven to Success
 At the time, Mr. Jett was living in a 400-square-foot, $700-a-month apartment on West 54th Street in Manhattan. To punish himself for his failure at First Boston and his poor work at Kidder, he deprived himself, he said, of "every comfort." Mr. Jett said he removed his furniture and began sleeping on the floor. He said he was more determined than ever to prove himself.
In 1992, his fortunes suddenly improved. He not only made lots of money trading, but he attracted the attention of Edward A. Cerullo, the powerful head of fixed-income trading at Kidder. That year, Mr. Jett took home a $2 million bonus.
By March 1993, Mr. Jett had become such a big star that Mr. Cerullo decided to hand him the government trading desk, where he suddenly had enormous authority and 32 people reporting to him.
"I was asked to remake the government desk," he said. "It required doing things that were emotionally hard for people to do."
Mr. Jett said he dismissed four people and clashed often with Kidder's sales force.
People familiar with the investigation into his trades, however, said that he also stepped up the unusual trading strategy that would ultimately end his rapid rise.
 
Kidder's New Star
A Midas Touch, Or So It Seemed
 Descriptions of what Mr. Jett's defenders say he did differ by 180 degrees from what Kidder and outside investigators say they have found. His defenders say he developed a highly profitable means for trading Government bonds, while critics contend that the strategy was a complete fraud, a stratagem for covering up a wretched trading record that piled up $100 million in losses.
Good government bond traders, former traders said, usually have revenues of $10 million to $30 million a year. But in 1993, Mr. Jett's profits began exceeding $10 million a month. Mr. Jett had invented a technique, it appeared to his supervisors, that turned a modest money maker into a powerful money machine, just as other young traders like Michael Vranos and Joseph W. Cherner had done at Kidder in recent years.
 
 
Firm Eager to Show Profits
 There also was a sense that Kidder executives might not have looked too closely at Mr. Jett's trading because he was suddenly posting big profits at a firm eager to impress its owner, General Electric, which had been threatening to sell Kidder.
As word of his success spread, other traders at Kidder and elsewhere on Wall Street were full of curiosity about Mr. Jett's trades.
Mr. Jett declined to comment on his technique or his exchanges with fellow traders. People familiar with his trading, however, said that he was executing a high volume of transactions, called forwards -- which are nothing more than instructions to the back office to get securities ready for settlement for a particular day -- and recording the anticipated earnings as current profits.
He apparently started small. In May 1993, Mr. Jett was trading about $3 billion a month, not an unusual amount for government bonds, a person familiar with the Kidder investigations said.
 
Trading Quickly Soars
 By the end of 1993, Mr. Jett's trading had soared and his system had apparently earned profits of more than $200 million for the year. He was paid a $9 million bonus and given a coveted chairman's award.
Every January, Kidder honors its top performers at a management conference. In January 1993, Mr. Jett attended the conference in Orlando, Fla., as a member of a task force on recruiting minorities. The experience made Mr. Jett -- who opposes affirmative action -- more determined than ever, he said, to earn a place at the gathering based on his performance.
"I did not want to be viewed as an affirmative action case," he said. "With affirmative action, all of a sudden, the expectation of lower standards was being codified."
His 1993 performance clearly seemed to have earned him the spot at the convention. At this year's conference in January, as he stood on the podium to accept the chairman's award, Mr. Jett said he was proud to be there based on his trading performance.
Although people who later described the speech recalled Mr. Jett comparing trading on Wall Street to war, he said he used the analogy only to describe how everyone at Kidder needed to work together.
 "I told them a story about my father in Korea," Mr. Jett said. "My dad was a sergeant. His troop was Hispanics, blacks, and rednecks from the deep South. When they landed, they set aside their differences and set about destroying the enemy. What I said was, 'At Kidder, we had to unite and work together.' "
 
No Camaraderie at Kidder
 Mr. Jett now says he never felt any camaraderie at Kidder. He seemed almost flabbergasted at the notion that he and Mr. Cerullo had a personal relationship. He said when he went on a ski trip to Mr. Cerullo's Aspen vacation home earlier this year, it was all business.
There soon were more pressing concerns. In the first few months of this year, as Mr. Jett's trading volume increased, the computer system had difficulty keeping up, a person familiar with the Kidder investigation said.
Kidder's computer specialists were stunned when they saw the scale of Mr. Jett's ostensible trades and noticed that none of the trades ever led to any actual securities changing hands, two people familiar with the events said. If the trades were never consummated, where had the hundreds of millions in profits booked by Mr. Jett come from?
As the computer people were joined by accountants, Mr. Cerullo and other top executives, the alarm grew. Mr. Jett's profits had been booked but the underlying trades were apparently never completed. Two or three days before a trade was to be completed, Mr. Jett rolled the trades over but kept the profits on the books, the person familiar with the investigation said.
And as his phantom profits accumulated, Mr. Jett executed larger and larger trades to keep the scheme afloat, the person said. He also used numerous trading variations to make his accounting maneuvers look like real trades.
 
A Lonely Fall
Shock and Denial As Scandal Unfolds
 The allegations contrast sharply with defense theories that portray Mr. Jett as someone who implemented sophisticated, highly lucrative trading techniques with the knowledge of profit-hungry superiors. His lawyers declined to discuss the substance of Mr. Jett's side of the story.
"There is a lot more here than meets the eye and has already been disclosed publicly," said Mr. Lowenfels, the securities lawyer on Mr. Jett's legal team.
By the time Kidder stopped the trades in April and summoned Mr. Jett to a meeting with top executives where he was questioned, about $250 billion in fictitious trades was still on the company's computers.
The volume of fake trades was so large that Kidder personnel initially suspected Mr. Jett must have had help. But the firm now believes, people familiar with the inquiry said, that Mr. Jett probably acted alone and was able to take advantage of a peculiarity in the computer system.
 
 
Helped by Technology
 "They had this great, superduper automated system that helped Jett create these positions by typing in a couple of numbers," one of the people familiar with the inquiry said.
By early April, Kidder knew it had a problem. Early in the week of April 11, Kidder alerted John F. Welch Jr., the chairman and chief executive of General Electric, that the problem could affect Kidder's bottom line. At that point, Kidder contacted the S.E.C. and New York Stock Exchange, alerting regulators that it expected a major loss of capital.
On Thursday, April 14, Mr. Jett was summoned to the meeting with Mr. Cerullo and other top Kidder executives. He denied that he had done anything wrong, offering various explanations. At the end of the meeting, he walked out the door of Kidder for what was probably the last time.
 
 
A $210 Million Charge
 On Sunday, April 17, Mr. Cerullo sent Mr. Jett a curt letter telling him that he had been dismissed. Later that evening, General Electric issued a press release saying that it would have to reduce after-tax earnings by $210 million because Mr. Jett had inflated his trading profits. Kidder also froze the $8 million that Mr. Jett had left behind in three personal accounts at the firm.
Although Kidder released some funds to Mr. Jett on Friday, he is still concerned that he will need more to pay his lawyers and his public relations firm.
Despite his fears, the former Kidder trader can find humor in the bizarre turn his life has taken. For example, Mr. Jett noted what happened a day after Kidder accused him of making phantom trades.
"That Monday I woke up in a daze," he said. "I got dressed in a suit as if I was going to work. When I got downstairs and opened the door," Mr. Jett said, stepping back and imitating a man in the glare of sudden lights, "there was a network television crew.
"And you know what," he said, laughing. "They let me walk right by. At that point the media didn't know I was black. So they let me walk right by."

HEADLINE: G.O.P. IN VIRGINIA NOMINATES NORTH FOR SENATE SEAT

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: RICHMOND, June 4

 BODY:
Forsaking appeals from Ronald Reagan in March and other party heroes, the Virginia Republican Party today nominated Oliver L. North for the United States Senate, setting the stage for one of the year's most unpredictable and acrimonious contests.
Mr. North won 55 percent of the vote at the party's state convention, to 45 percent for James C. Miller, an economist and a budget director in President Reagan's Administration. 
 A triumphant Mr. North took to the podium to the theme from "Rocky," and, borrowing from President Clinton's anthem after the New Hampshire primary in 1992, proclaimed himself "the real comeback kid."
Then he put the White House on notice. "Today, we send the Clintons and their cronies a simple but unmistakable message," said Mr. North, as his wife, Betsy, looked on beside him. "This is our Government, you stole it, and we are going to take it back." He ridiculed the White House as teeming with "20-something kids with an earring and an axe to grind."
With balloon drops, blaring bands and a huge American flag behind the stage, the Richmond Coliseum was transformed into the site of a grand spectacle. Party officials said the event drew nearly 15,000 delegates, more than any political gathering in American history and close to three times the number who were at the party's national convention in 1992.
But the celebratory air and outward unity were little more than a red, white and blue facade. With his conviction, later overturned, on felony charges for his role in the Iran-contra affair, Mr. North has emerged as one of the most polarizing figures in modern American politics. To his admirers, he is a brave patriot, while to his detractors, he is a duplicitous criminal.
Mr. North's candidacy -- even before his nomination here today -- had thrust the state's Republicans into turmoil just a year after the party's jubilation over seizing the governorship for the first time in 12 years. Many delegates here vowed to follow the lead of Senator John W. Warner and oppose Mr. North in November. But others accused the state's senior Senator of disloyalty after he threw his support this week to the likely independent candidacy of J. Marshall Coleman. "Dump Warner" buttons were a popular item on the convention floor.
 
Conservative Support
 Well beyond Virginia, national party officials fear that Mr. North is such a divisive candidate that he could deprive the party of what appeared to be a clear shot at defeating the Democratic incumbent, Senator Charles S. Robb, the onetime war hero who has been tarnished in the last few years by several embarrassing disclosures about his private life. The race is of such national interest that even former President Reagan, for whom Mr. North served on the staff of the National Security Council, thrust himself into the fray in mid-March by writing that he was "getting pretty steamed about the statements coming from Oliver North." Mr. Reagan protested Mr. North's saying that he had lied to Congress under Mr. Reagan's orders. Mr. North later said the statements for which Mr. Reagan called him a liar had been intentionally misrepresented in the press.
Mr. North's nomination was also an important demonstration of the growing potency of Christian conservatives, who form the core of his support and who have come to dominate several state Republican organizations this year. In fact, the religious conservatives proved to be a far more powerful force at the convention, which can be swayed by small but motivated groups, than they have historically been in the state as a whole. That was why it probably would have been far more difficult for Mr. North to win the nomination had there been an open primary, like the Democrats will hold on June 14.
With Mr. North expected to face Mr. Robb, who has clung to a wide lead over his opponents in that primary, the main event is likely to be between two former marines whose negative ratings are among the highest of any candidates running for Federal office this year. Both candidates have engendered such opposition in their own parties that they will probably be challenged by party members running as independents in November.
Former Gov. L. Douglas Wilder, a Democrat who has feuded with Mr. Robb for years, is poised to run, as is Mr. Coleman, a Republican and former State Attorney General. With so many candidates, it would be virtually impossible to rate anyone as a front-runner. The winner would need only 26 percent of the vote. Mr. Wilder, for one, would be buoyed by his support among blacks, while Mr. North could depend on his strength with conservative Christians.
In an odd scene typical of the changing and twisted alliances in the race, supporters of Mr. Wilder set up a booth here to collect signatures on a nominating petition to put him on the ballot as an independent. They managed to get dozens of signatures before being booted out by angry partisans.
 
Ultimate Outsider
 With his conservative positions and national celebrity, the 50-year-old Mr. North appears to be seeking the mantle of Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina. He has built his career -- and personal fortune -- on criticizing Congress, the body that excoriated him during the Iran-contra hearings in 1987. Despite his own service in the White House, Mr. North is portraying himself as the ultimate outsider, a theme he emphasized in his vigorous speech before the voting.
Much of Mr. North's message was devoted to demeaning the press, and he singled out Ted Koppel, the host of the ABC News program "Nightline" who harshly questioned the candidate's truthfulness. At one point today, Mr. North lumped Mr. Koppel with his other favorite foes, referring to "Clinton, Congress, Koppel and above all, Chuck -- we'll beat 'em all like a dozen eggs."
Mr. North had long been viewed as the favorite to win the Republican nomination. But his forces viewed Mr. Miller as a serious threat because of his support from major figures wanting to stop Mr. North. In addition, the quirky nature of voting at the state convention only added to the uncertainty over the outcome.
Any Virginia Republican could become a delegate if they paid a $45 registration fee. The party set the overall delegate vote for each county, weighted to favor counties that cast more votes for Republicans in the 1992 and 1993 elections. Both camps spent months courting delegates with phone calls, mailings and personal appeals up to the last moment.
Though the system varied by county, most delegates filled out a paper ballot. Then, in a process similar to that of a national party convention, each district announced how many votes it had cast for each candidate.
A balding, rotund figure, Mr. Miller offers little of the rhetorical flourishes or charisma of his opponent. But in his plain-spoken appeal, he repeated his campaign theme that while he is as conservative as Mr. North, polls show that he would have a better chance to beat Mr. Robb.
Mr. Miller choose his words carefully to avoid inflaming Mr. North's backers. But scattered boos erupted when Mr. Miller raised the notion that a North victory would cost Republicans the seat.
"If we Virginia Republicans nominate a candidate who loses to Chuck Robb, Democrats from Hollywood to Manhattan would insist that Americans don't mind if politicians break promises, raise taxes and promote bigger government," he declared. The message, he added, would be that no one in Virginia "would care about integrity and honor."
Such warnings were what left Mr. Miller's supporters shaken after the voting today. Barbara Comstock, a Miller delegate from Fairfax County, in the Washington suburbs, said it would be hard for her to vote for Mr. North in November. "It's going to be a real hard sell," she said of Mr. North. "With North, it's like Bill Clinton. People either like him or they don't, and the negatives are way too high."

HEADLINE: Turkey, Hurt By Iraq Curbs, Requests Help

BYLINE: By HENRY KAMM, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ANKARA, Turkey

 BODY:
Turkey is pressing the United States and other Western and Arab allies for relief from the hardships that the United Nations embargo on Iraq imposes on its crisis-ridden economy.
At the same time, sentiment is growing against the continued use of Turkish territory for an international operation on behalf of Kurds in northern Iraq. 
 The Government of Prime Minister Tansu Ciller is seeking approval for a tentative agreement it reached with Iraq in April to conduct what it calls a "rescue operation" to reopen for repair the pipeline from the Kirkuk oilfields in Iraq to the Turkish port of Yumurtalik on the Mediterranean.
Under the agreement, Turkey would be allowed to buy for domestic use the 12 million barrels of crude oil that have been in the 616-mile pipeline since the embargo was imposed after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990 and would reimburse Iraq with food and medicine.
 
Pipeline 'Going to Rot'
 "Let us save the pipeline," President Suleyman Demirel said in an interview. "It is going to rot."
Western diplomats expressed sympathy but emphasized that their governments were in varying degrees reluctant to breach the embargo.
Ozdem Sanberk, the second-in-command in the Turkish Foreign Ministry, negotiated the deal in Baghdad. He emphasized in an interview that the deal had not yet been signed. He said 3.8 million barrels of the oil in the pipeline belonged to Turkey, having been paid for before the sanctions. Turkey, he said, has rejected Iraqi demands to export the oil and stands firm against transferring money to Iraq.
Mr. Demirel said Turkey would stick with the coalition that defeated President Saddam Hussein in the 1991 Persian Gulf war. "We are not going to make a deal with Saddam," he said.
 
Heavy Losses for Turkey
 Mr. Demirel said the war and embargo had cost Turkey $15 billion to $20 billion, of which it had been compensated "three or four billion" by "our friends in the gulf."
Iraq was one of the country's most important trading partners before the war. Turkey is still owed about $2 billion for construction projects. He said Turkey had also lost the $600 million or $700 million a year that it collected for the use of the pipeline.
Most sensitive, perhaps, has been the effect of the cutoff in Iraqi trade in southeastern Turkey, where the Turkish military is conducting a war against the Kurdish Workers Party.
Mr. Demirel also spoke of what he called the political and social problems caused by the operation to aid Kurds in northern Iraq. Northern Iraq, like southeastern Turkey, is largely populated by Kurds, who have struggled since the breakup of the Ottoman Empire for national recognition, which Turkey, Iraq and Iran have all denied. Mr. Demirel said he and many Turks feared the consequences of the de facto detachment of northern Iraq from Iraqi control.
"We are very sensitive about that," Mr. Demirel said. "The protection of these people should not result in a Kurdish state. Our mercy, our humanitarian feelings should not create something we don't like."
The Speaker of Turkey's Parliament, Husamettin Cindoruk, who is considered a contender for prime minister, said Parliament would accept the operation for another six months when it expires June 30 "if the Government insists." He added, "But it will be the last time."

HEADLINE: Man in the News;
Gyula Horn, Recycled Communist, to Lead Hungary

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BUDAPEST, June 4

 BODY:
After a stunning comeback in elections last weekend, Hungary's victorious Socialist Party today designated its leader, Gyula Horn, a tough politician with deep roots in the Communist era, as its choice for Prime Minister.
The vote by the former Communist party assures that Mr. Horn, 61, will become Hungary's next Prime Minister after a new Parliament convenes in early July. The Socialists captured 209 of 386 parliamentary seats in the final voting last Sunday, with most attributing the result to discontent with free-market policies. 
 A heavy smoker who understands English but does not speak it in public, Mr. Horn (his first name is pronounced JOO-la) transformed himself in the final years of Communist rule from a party apparatchik into a Western-leaning foreign policy expert. Yet Hungarian analysts say he retains the characteristics that made him successful within the Communist party structure: a certain ruthlessness and adroitness in outwitting his opponents.
 
'The Political Fox'
 "In the 60's and 70's, Horn was not among the reformers," Laszlo Lengyel, a political scientist, wrote in a recent article about the party leader, which bore the title "The Political Fox."
"It was in the Nemeth Government that Horn stopped being an apparatchik and became a professional foreign policy player," he wrote. Mr. Horn served as Foreign Minister in Prime Minister Miklos Nemeth's Government, which governed from 1989 to 1990.
In the weeks before Parliament convenes, Mr. Horn is talking with the Alliance of Free Democrats, heavy losers in the elections, about the possibility of forming a coalition.
Because the Socialists won an outright majority of parliamentary seats, they do not need the Free Democrats, a party born from the anti-Communist opposition of the 1980's, to govern. There are wide doubts about how sincere Mr. Horn is in his offer of a coalition, though few believe that the Socialists would turn the clock back by reinstating Communist policies.
"Horn is giving the offer, but he's trying to get them to reject it," said Andrew Arato, a professor from the New School in New York who is a visiting scholar at the Central European University. "The Socialists need something that looks like a coalition, but it is not clear whether they want a real one."
 
Publicity Maneuver
 Today Mr. Horn sounded more conciliatory toward the Free Democrats. At a news conference after the party congress, he said the Socialists were willing to give the Free Democrats more posts in the Government than their vote totals would earn them.
He also said the economic programs of the two parties were close and that he hoped "very strongly" that the Free Democrats would join in serious talks on a coalition.
Nonetheless, Mr. Horn seemed to show some of his old cunning this week by maneuvering his potential partners into an awkward situation. Mr. Horn told the Free Democrats he wanted to change a meeting site from neutral territory to his own party headquarters because too many journalists would congregate at the known meeting place.
The Socialists tipped off the press, and a phalanx of cameras recorded the Democrats' paying homage to the victorious Mr. Horn at the former headquarters of the Budapest Communist Party. "It was a childish trick," said one Free Democrat.
 
With the Communists in '56
 Born in Budapest on July 5, 1932, Mr. Horn was one of seven children brought up in poverty and political violence. His father was arrested by the Nazis because of his membership in the Communist party and killed on his way to a concentration camp.
Mr. Horn wound his way into the highest party echelons over three decades of obedience to the party norms.
A promising student, Mr. Horn was sent by the Communist Party to an accounting school in Rostov, Russia. On his return to Hungary he joined the Finance Ministry. He took the side of the Communist authorities during the failed 1956 uprising, joining an auxiliary police unit assigned to guarding bridges.
In the 1960's, he was posted as a junior diplomat in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, where he learned Serbo-Croatian, and in Sofia, Bulgaria. In 1969 he began his climb within the Communist Party's department of Foreign Affairs. He joined the Foreign Ministry as Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in 1985 and was appointed Foreign Minister four years later.
He took the unorthodox route of promoting relations with countries that had previously been off-limits. "He was a realpolitik politician," said one of his close friends, Jozsef Gyorke, who was Hungary's Ambassador in London in 1989. "He thought it was an ostrich-like position to ignore Israel, South Africa and South Korea. Whether we liked them or not, they existed."

HEADLINE: Clinton Says That North Korea Can Still Avoid U.N. Sanctions

BYLINE: By JOHN DARNTON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PORTSMOUTH, England, June 4

 BODY:
Trying to ease the confrontation with North Korea over nuclear inspections, President Clinton said today that North Korea could still take action to avoid economic sanctions.
The President's remarks, at a joint news conference with Prime Minister John Major prior to the D-Day commemorations, came a day after North Korea said it would regard sanctions as a declaration of war. 
 The President did not specify what steps he expected the North Korean Government to take to avoid sanctions, other than presumably opening up its nuclear sites for whatever inspections can still be carried out. And he insisted that North Korea's defiance "made it virtually imperative" that the Security Council take up the question of sanctions.
The United States, Japan and South Korea have concluded that North Korea's refusal to allow inspectors of the International Atomic Energy Agency to examine a nuclear reactor to see if spent fuel has been diverted to its weapons program is a sure sign that it is developing nuclear weapons.
 
Joint Statement on Sanctions
 Ending two days of talks today in Washington, officials from the three nations said in a joint statement that the United Nations should "urgently consider an appropriate response, including sanctions." It is not yet clear whether China or Russia, both of which have veto power as permanent members of the Security Council, would support such a move.
Japan, which greatly fears the specter of nuclear weapons in Asia, has signaled that it might consider imposing economic sanctions even without a United Nations vote. Japan is an important source of hard currency for North Korea.
The growing confrontation has been a preoccupying cloud, though not a very large one, over Mr. Clinton's second trip to Europe as President, which includes a visit to England, where he was a Rhodes scholar at Oxford.
On Friday, the head of the United Nations nuclear monitoring agency told the Security Council that North Korea had already removed most of the fuel rods from the reactor in dispute at Yongbyon, including the 300 rods considered critical to determining whether weapons-grade plutonium has been diverted in the past.
 
U.S. Offers Way Out
 In his remarks today, President Clinton sought to give North Korea some room to back away from the dispute.
"There's still time for North Korea to avoid sanctions actually taking effect if we can work out something on the nuclear inspectors," he said. "I think that clearly sanctions are not any sort of act of war and should not be seen as such. All we want them to do is keep their word, and we're going to try to give them chances to do it."
South Korea, meanwhile, made a point of declaring that it was prepared to repulse any military attack from the north. South Korean Government officials met in Seoul to set up a task force to assess national readiness.
President Kim Young Sam, traveling in Russia, told reporters, "We and the United States are fully prepared and have enough military power ready to meet any emergencies." He said that "round-the-clock surveillance on the North's movements" was under way.

HEADLINE: China Tries to Blot Out Memories of 1989

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BEIJING, June 4

 BODY:
China deployed security forces against its dissidents today and interrupted international news broadcasts to prevent commemoration of the fifth anniversary of the 1989 military attack on the Tiananmen Square democracy movement.
In anticipation of the anniversary, security agencies had put scores of dissidents under house arrest or close surveillance, a tactic most recently used during Secretary of State Warren Christopher's visit in March. 
 At dawn today, Tiananmen Square was ringed by security agents in plainclothes and in uniform, some dozing in their cars and others scanning the 99-acre expanse with binoculars. The security men seemed to outnumber the early-morning strollers, kite-fliers and shadow boxers out for their daily exercise.
 
Blocking Televised Images
 The authorities also threw a cordon of police officers around the university district in northwestern Beijing, a wellspring of the 1989 protests. Public events were canceled, and hotels were instructed to unplug their satellite connections to Cable News Network.
Even in housing compounds reserved for foreign diplomats, journalists and business executives, the authorities interrupted satellite television service whenever Western networks broadcast images of the 1989 protests in news reports of the anniversary.
Gladdened by President Clinton's decision last week to stop linking China's human rights performance to its $30 billion in exports to America, Communist Party leaders are hoping to pass the anniversary weekend without incident.
The past five years have been defined by the crackdown -- a tank and machine assault on unarmed civilian protesters who had laid siege to the Chinese capital, put up a "Goddess of Democracy" and refused to disperse in the face of a martial-law decree. Hundreds died and many more were wounded during the night of June 3 and the early morning hours of June 4, 1989.
After the killings, thousands of students and workers who took part in the movement were rounded up and imprisoned. Others fled overseas. International condemnation of the crackdown led to nearly three years of economic sanctions and political isolation for China as it pursued a policy of wide repression of dissent.
 
China's Determined Normalcy
 Today the national flags of China and Cambodia lined the Avenue of Eternal Peace, which crosses Tiananmen Square, in honor of a state visit by King Norodom Sihanouk of Cambodia. In a gesture underlining China's goal to convey a determined normalcy, President Jiang Zemin ceremoniously greeted the King on the square on Friday.
During the ceremony, King Sihanouk laid a wreath at the Monument to the People's Heroes at the center of Tiananmen Square -- the same spot that served as the headquarters of student democracy campaigners who occupied the square in 1989.
Despite the security clampdown today, some expressions of defiance broke through.
 
Reminiscences by Computer
 Using international computer networks easily accessible in China, Chinese students and professionals on several continents published an electronic file of personal reminiscences of the night of June 3-4. Hundreds of people in China have access to the computer network, which is used at universities, Government ministries and foreign companies.
One Chinese student recalled the experience of being run down by a tank on the Avenue of Eternal Peace west of Tiananmen Square. The driver, possibly blinded by a cloud of tear gas, rushed the students as they stood on the side of the avenue.
"Since I was in the front row, I found no way to run," the student wrote in the electronic file. "I was bumped onto the ground. I thought, 'It's all over!' "
"When I came to," he continued, "I sat up. I could not move my left thigh. It's lying on the ground, strangely shaped. . . By my side, there were seven to 10 mashed bodies, too terrible to look at."
In another act of commemoration that got past the attempts at a news blackout, a People's University philosophy professor who is under house arrest, Ding Zilin, was able to inform news agencies that she and her husband, Jiang Peikun, observed a three-day fast in memory of their 17-year-old son, who was felled by an army bullet on the night of June 3, 1989.
 
A Call to End Repression
 In a letter to the National People's Congress, she implored the country's leaders to reflect on the age and the innocence of the students who died.
Speaking of her own son, she asked, "Is he not even allowed to have on untainted spot in which his spirit can rest?"
Professors Ding and Jiang were among the seven intellectuals who signed a petition in March calling on Communist Party leaders to end political repression, a call that the leadership answered with a greater clampdown.
An Asian diplomat who was touring Tiananmen Square today by car so he could report back to his Government stopped a reporter on a bicycle to remark, "There are not going to be any more protest movements in China until after Deng Xiaoping dies."
Mr. Deng, China's 89-year-old paramount leader, has refused to reconsider an official Government verdict that branded the demonstrations as "counter-revolutionary rebellion."
Repression in China today is also related to anxiety in the Communist Party hierarchy over inflation, growing unemployment, corruption and crime, which are threatening to undermine national stability and therefore party rule.
Tonight, as the anniversary ended, the only comment from a pedicab driver seeking a fare near the square was, "For us Chinese, how pitiful is this history."

HEADLINE: Papandreou Barks Less This Time

BYLINE: By HENRY KAMM, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ATHENS

 BODY:
When Andreas Papandreou was Prime Minister through most of the 1980's, he made Greece the odd man out in the Atlantic and European alliances.
With his anti-Western Socialist oratory and friendships with people like Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi of Libya and Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, who imposed martial law on Poland, Mr. Papandreou seemed to go out of his way to offend fellow NATO members and the European Community. 
 The United States was his particular target, and Washington responded by cooling its long friendship with Greece. Although Mr. Papandreou had spent more than 20 years in the United States and had become a citizen, served in the Navy in World War II, taught at many universities and served as chairman of the economics department at the University of California at Berkeley, he was not invited to Washington during his eight years in office.
 
Concern in the West
 When a convincing election victory of his Pan-Hellenic Socialist Movement returned him to office last October, after four years of the conservative Government of Prime Minister Constantine Mitsotakis, concern ran high in Western capitals.
But Mr. Papandreou has established himself in Western eyes as a better ally and better European. "It's the dog that didn't bark," a senior Western diplomat said.
Mr. Papandreou's first official visit to Washington, in April, crowned Greece's readmittance to full partnership. His meeting with President Clinton produced no progress on issues of mutual concern -- Greece's embargo on the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, its warm relations with ostracized Serbia and Turkey's continued occupation of northern Cyprus -- but an informed official said that the two leaders enjoyed getting acquainted, and Mr. Papandreou emphasized his pleasant memories of the United States.
"He was anxious to draw a line under that period," the official said, recalling Mr. Papandreou's earlier Prime Ministership.
 
Critique From Opponents
 In Athens, Mr. Papandreou's opponents write off the visit as a failure because he did not win American support for demands that Macedonia change its name, which Greeks consider their exclusive property, nor did he win stronger American support of Greece's position regarding Turkey.
Greek politics remain intensely personal. An old-fashioned political spoils system has led to widespread replacements of senior civil servants and top managers in the large state sector of industry.
And just as Mr. Mitsotakis began court action against Mr. Papandreou, charging misdeeds and corruption in office (a court acquitted him), Mr. Papandreou has retaliated. Mr. Mitsotakis stands accused of misappropriating antiquities for his private collection, tapping opponents' telephones and corruption.
But there is little debate on issues of state. Mr. Papandreou has inherited the rundown economy he passed on to Mr. Mitsotakis. Under his Government, which spends more and privatizes less than the previous one, the national debt has risen to more than 150 percent of the gross national product. Under the rules of the European Union, which is Greece's main source of economic support, indebtedness must not exceed 60 percent of G.N.P.
The Government has not spelled out an economic program, and because of its own poor economic record, the New Democracy Party, which formerly ran the country, has not stimulated much public debate.
From the right and the left, surprisingly, criticism strikes a similar note. It concentrates on inaction, owing partly to Mr. Papandreou's age, 75, and frail health. "All ministries seem to be at a standstill," said Virginia Tsouderou, Deputy Foreign Minister in the Mitsotakis Government. "It's an orchestra without a maestro."
"The country is tired of the old faces. There is a disgust with all politicians. We also didn't inspire the people," she said.
Leonidas Kyrkos, who for many years led the anti-Moscow wing of the split Communist Party, said: "What Andreas started, Mitsotakis completed. Now there is more disillusionment. It is not like Papandreou I. The people are extremely tired and have turned their back on politics."

HEADLINE: GIULIANI IS MOVING TO LIMIT AWARDS WHEN CITY IS SUED

BYLINE: By JAN HOFFMAN 

 BODY:
With juries finding New York City's pockets nearly bottomless, the Giuliani administration is moving to make it harder for people to sue the city.
This year, the city estimates it will pay out $262 million to settle lawsuits and other claims, a figure that has doubled in seven years. That amount could be cut by a third, officials reckon, if Albany enacts a package of proposals that would put such cases in the hands of judges rather than juries and would limit awards for pain and suffering. 
 But opposition has been swift and furious among personal-injury lawyers, whose fees would be cut in the process, and from consumer-protection groups, who say the city should not balance its budget at the expense of those it has injured.
Many efforts by earlier administrations to curtail awards were unsuccessful. This time, proponents see several factors making action more likely: anti-lawyer sentiment, the city's budget difficulties, and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's support for one major change, the switch from jury trials.
"As we get beyond the budget, tort reform will be one of the administration's three or four major objectives for the summer and the fall," said Forrest R. Taylor, a spokesman for Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.
Among the proposals are a medical-expense threshold of $5,000 before a person can ask for damages based on pain and suffering and a cap of $250,000 on such damages.
Paul A. Crotty, the Corporation Counsel, said 39 other states, including New Jersey and Pennsylvania, had adopted similar and even more restrictive liability laws against public entities.
Other proposals include barring anyone who is injured while committing a felony from suing the city. The city also wants to make owners of commercial buildings and apartment houses maintain sidewalks and also share legal responsibility for costly slip-and-fall cases.
Compensation for lawyers would drop, too: as award dollars rose, the percentage of a lawyer's fees would shrink. That has been the compensation schedule for private and public medical-malpractice cases statewide since the Legislature approved the change in 1985. In other cases, lawyers typically collect about 33 percent of an award, regardless of the size.
Budget planners estimate that if all the proposals were adopted, the city would immediately save $87 million in 1995. But anticipating that only some will survive, they have figured $45 million in savings in the 1995 budget.
Critics of the proposals challenge the notion that lawsuits filed against the city deserve exemptions not available to private defendants. But Mr. Crotty said the system was so out of hand that it was draining money from services like parks and libraries, which benefit the public as a whole but have a combined budget of less than the fund to settle lawsuits.
But the city has been vulnerable to higher verdicts than either private defendants or even New York State. Russell F. Moran of The New York Jury Verdict Reporter, who studied verdicts in civil cases from 1987 to 1993, found that when New York jurors delivered a verdict against a private defendant, the average award was nearly $1.5 million. When the defendant was New York City, that average rose to $2.6 million. (Jury verdicts are often reduced on appeal.)
The discrepancy between awards against the city and those against the state is equally striking. While city lawsuits are heard by juries, lawsuits involving the state are decided by a judge. From 1987 to 1993, Mr. Moran said, a judge's average award against the state for a knee injury came to $175,271. But city juries considering similar lawsuits gave plaintiffs an average of $442,536.
The drumbeats for and against the measures are just beginning. Assemblywoman Helene E. Weinstein, a Brooklyn Democrat who heads the Assembly's Judiciary Committee, has already expressed the Assembly's traditional resistance, while State Senator James J. Lack, a Suffolk County Republican who is her equally influential Senate counterpart, supports some of the proposals.
But enthusiasm for the package does not necessarily rise and fall along party lines. Senator Lack has introduced a bill similar to one proposed this year by Governor Cuomo: that city cases be heard by a judge, not a jury. That is how lawsuits against New York State have been conducted since 1929.
"The cities shouldn't be discriminated against," said Victor A. Kovner, who, as the Dinkins administration's Corporation Counsel, campaigned unsuccessfully for similar measures. "If someone is hit by a city car, why should they be treated differently than someone hit by a state car?"
Those favoring a switch to judges say that those trials move more swiftly than jury trials, and that judges are less susceptible to heart-wrenching pleas for additional compensation for pain and suffering.
And having judges hear the cases, proponents say, will bring a consistency to the awards, which now vary wildly depending on the borough. In a study for The New York Law Journal that looked at a decade of personal-injury verdicts against the city as well as private defendants, The New York Jury Verdict Reporter found, for example, that a Bronx jury puts the value of a herniated disc at $740,000, while the same injury in Queens goes for the comparatively bargain-basement price of $502,000.
But to plaintiffs' lawyers, the move to trials by judge signals the beginning of the end. The actions of a city should be judged by its citizenry, they contend.
Assemblywoman Weinstein said that rather than depriving a plaintiff of the right to a jury trial, the city would do better to support changes in the jury system proposed this year. Under the proposals, professionals and business owners would be compelled to do their jury duty, and the pro-plaintiff bent of some juries might be altered. "The city might not find itself facing only jurors who are out to get the city," she said.
 
Re-evaluating Pain
 The proposals that provoke the most anger from trial lawyers and consumer groups are the caps on damages for pain and suffering. In contrast to straightforward damages like medical expenses and lost wages, pain and suffering is a broad category with fuzzy edges.
"To a large extent, pain and suffering is a make-believe injury," said Mr. Crotty, the city's Corporation Counsel, who went to Albany last month to promote the proposals. "It is more attributable to the lawyer's ingenuity than anything else."
But Pamela Gilbert of Public Citizen, the national consumer group founded by Ralph Nader, called such initiatives "harsh and heartless and mean-spirited." Often, she said, awards for pain and suffering are more important to the plaintiff than awards for economic losses.
Under the Mayor's plan, she said, a corporate executive would get more money than someone with the same injury who was poor or elderly. Although an elderly man and the executive might get the same maximum of $250,000 for pain and suffering, the executive's total verdict would be higher because he would be reimbursed for his lost wages.
"You're balancing the budget on the backs of the most devastated people," she said.
In the same vein, said Stephan H. Peskin, the president of the New York State Trial Lawyers Association, the requirement that a plaintiff have at least $5,000 in medical expenses before seeking damages for pain and suffering shut out many people.
And the city could be doing a lot more to prevent injuries, some lawyers say. "There are gaps between the platform and the train at the Union Square station," Mr. Peskin said. "But how many times do people have to get injured there before the transit system fixes it?"
 
Incentives Toward Prevention
 But unlike the cattle-prod effect that big judgments have against, say, automobile manufacturers, city agencies that are sued do not have the same incentive to clean up their act -- to repair potholes and sidewalks, or to train police officers not to use excessive force.
Part of the reason is that the money to settle lawsuits -- $220 million last year, up from $120 million in 1987 -- comes out of a general judgments fund, not from the budget of the agency that is challenged. Mr. Crotty said he and city budget planners had begun talking about having the agencies themselves administer judgment funds. Lawyers have also been resistant to the Mayor's plan to trim their fees. Personal-injury lawyers are paid only when a verdict or a settlement is reached, when they typically collect a third of the award. But in 1985, the Legislature changed the collection schedule for medical malpractice cases so that the percentage of the fee would decline as the award rose.
Many lawyers saw the new fee schedule as a disincentive to take shaky or small-judgment cases. In 1985, there were 653 cases brought against the city's doctors, hospitals and clinics, according to the New York City Law Department. But by 1993, that number had dropped to 411.
"We get the same telephone calls from clients now as then about what is happening to them in city hospitals," said Philip M. Damashek, a prominent plaintiffs' lawyer. "We feel sorry for them. But we can't help everyone where we can't receive a fee to stay in business for the months and years that it takes to pursue a case against the city."
Now the city wants to extend the same graduated scale to all cases against it. For judgments of more than $1.25 million, for example, legal fees would fall to 10 percent.
While the city's campaign for change is still in the early stages, some predict that in these lean and mean times the Mayor may prevail on at least some fronts. Peter L. Zimroth, a Corporation Counsel during the Koch administration, wished his Republican counterpart well.
"The initiatives are very important for the long-term health of the city," he said. "These cases punish the poorest people in the city because that's who the money gets taken away from."

HEADLINE: Despite Incentives to Stay, Mastercard Plans Move to Suburbs

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
Less than a year after Mastercard International said it would stay in Manhattan, it is considering moving most of its 450 New York employees to the suburbs.
No announcement is to be made until the annual board meeting on July 15. But the huge credit-card association has looked at nine office buildings in White Plains, and in Stamford, Conn. It has also shown nearly a dozen potential sublet tenants, including two big financial-services concerns, through the nine floors it has leased at Burlington House, 1345 Avenue of the Americas, at 55th Street. Mastercard had planned to begin moving into Burlington House next May. 
 Mastercard would probably retain the top two floors and keep about 90 employees in New York.
An internal memo dated May 12 and faxed to The New York Times by an angry employee on Friday projected Mastercard's cost of staying in New York City at $505 million in the next 22 years. A move to the suburbs, it said, would save at least $241 million, probably closer to $273 million.
Mastercard estimates that 33 percent of its employees would leave if it moved to White Plains, according to the memo. A move to Stamford would cause 39 percent to leave, it says.
No employee would talk on the record, citing fear of retribution. But many say they are furious. "We bought a house, and several of our colleagues bought Manhattan co-ops," said the wife of one senior manager. "How can they expect my husband to trade an hour's train ride for a 100-mile car commute?" Her husband is job-hunting, she said.
H. Eugene Lockhart, who took over Mastercard's presidency when Alex W. (Pete) Hart left in February, said he had been working closely with an employee support group to see how he could reduce attrition figures from the projected levels.
F. David Brangaccio, the senior vice president who generated the employee memo, said Mastercard would offer a generous relocation and home-resale program.
Mastercard would lose the tax breaks New York City gave it to stay. But those totaled only $2 million in 20 years at Mastercard's current staffing level, and a maximum of $8 million if it doubled its work force.
Lower rents in suburbia would more than make up that cost. Real-estate brokers say prestigious space that costs nearly $40 a square foot annually in Manhattan costs less than $20 in Westchester or Stamford.
"Combine that with lower taxes and utility rates, and they'll save a fortune," one real estate broker said.
Mastercard would probably be able to sublet its Manhattan space at a profit. Real-estate brokers say Mastercard got an excellent deal at Burlington House, with annual rents in the range of $30 to $40 a square foot, with an ample period of free rent, and with the landlord paying nearly $60 a square foot to customize the space.
One clear loser if Mastercard moves is the New York economy. A year ago, the Dinkins administration estimated that retaining Mastercard would yield $81 million from taxes and related business expenses in 20 years. If Mastercard doubled its staff to 900, the boon was estimated at $176 million.
"Mastercard hasn't said they are moving," said Catie Marshall, a spokeswoman for the New York City Economic Development Corporation. "So as far as we're concerned, we still have a deal."

HEADLINE: Competition and Telecommunications

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "AT&T, MCI, Sprint: Cozy Competitors" (Viewpoints, May 22), Kenneth G. Robinson would have us believe that the long-distance business isn't competitive and that the best hope for long-distance customers is competition from local phone companies.
Mr. Robinson wants us to believe that the regional Bell operating companies, currently limited to local service, would bring down long-distance prices if only they could get into that business. He has trouble coming to grips with the fact that long-distance prices have been falling and local rates have been rising since the businesses were separated 10 years ago. 
 Long-distance service is competitive, and local service is a monopoly. Have you ever tried switching local service companies? Don't bother. But 16 million consumers, an average of 44,000 a day, switched long-distance carriers in 1992. And there are plenty of long-distance companies to choose from: 420 in all.
A 1993 study by the Stanford University economist Robert Hall found that inflation-adjusted revenue per minute for the largest carriers fell by 66 percent between 1985 and 1992. After a long period of price cuts, recent years have seen some increases in basic long-distance rates. But long-distance companies have been offering bigger and bigger discounts. Mr. Robinson argues that when one long-distance company raises its price for selected services, the others tend to follow. But the same trend applies when one company lowers its prices.
The bottom line is that allowing the regional Bell operators into long distance before establishing competition in local service would have serious negative consequences for the American economy and American consumers.

HEADLINE: BEHIND THE WHEEL/Honda Accord Station Wagon;
Good for People, But Not for Bureaus

BYLINE: By MARSHALL SCHUON 

 BODY:
TWO of my lesser charms, or so says my wife, are that I am a pack rat and that I am occasionally lazy. As usual, she is half right.
It is true that the last thing I threw away was a water bill from 1959. But I am lazy on more than just an occasional basis, a fact reflected by the bottles and cans that fill one of the rooms in our basement. 
 My town requires recycling, so the plastic liters and tin cans pile up, awaiting a trip to the machines that go kachunk-kachunk and spill out a pitiful amount of change for all the time one needs to spend.
On the other hand, when Honda comes up with a new series of its Accord station wagon -- the second in Accord's history -- and when that wagon appears in the driveway, it is a good time to circle the flagons.
So I loaded those bags of bottles and cans into the maroon test vehicle, a rounded and fairly wonderful example of today's Japanese intrusion into the American automobile scene.
Intrusion is not right, of course, since all of the Accord wagons are built in America, and the Accord has been one of the more popular export models to Japan and Europe.
The $21,720 test car, with front-wheel drive and four doors, like all new Accord wagons, had blackout trim around its windows, and was a fully loaded model. For '94, the wagon is available in two levels, LX and EX, and both have 2.2-liter four-cylinder engines with four valves per cylinder.
There is a difference, though. The LX makes do with 130 horsepower, while the EX -- with a different valve configuration -- puts out 145 horses. Dual air bags are standard, and both wagons meet the 1997 Federal standard for side-impact protection. Anti-lock brakes are standard on the EX and optional on the LX, which has a base sticker price of $18,180.
The tester rode on 15-inch wheels and had bumpers that should suffer no damage from a five-mile-per-hour thump. Up front, the sloping hood leads to a body that is far more rounded than in the past, with a narrow grille, a black air dam and body-colored bumpers that blend well into the station wagon's body.
A remote entry system is standard on the EX, as are most of the niceties, the only option being an $87 set of floor mats. Also standard are power door locks, power side view mirrors and a rear windshield wiper and washer.
Inside, there was gray cloth and vinyl, nicely done as always. Unfortunately, and especially at the price, power seat adjustments were missing as they generally are on Hondas, although there was an electrical adjustment for lumbar support.
In back, and surprising given the vehicle's relatively small size, there was good room. In fact, the Accord delivers well on its promise of five-passenger family value. Headroom is not great, mind you, but the station wagon does offer both reasonable comfort and carrying capacity.
For the driver, there is a dead pedal for the left foot, and a four-spoke vinyl steering wheel with cruise control buttons between the two right spokes. The two main gauges are a 140-mile-an-hour speedometer and an 8,000 r.p.m. tachometer, with other gauges for the temperature of the engine and the amount of gasoline in the tank.
A toll-change bin is off to the left of the steering wheel, handy as usual.
Less useful is the ashtray (my notes say "dumb") in front of the shifter, whose lever works the standard five-speed manual. Also in the center console is a covered dual cup holder, but the interior designers might as well not have bothered. It is too small, barely holding a can or a cup.
Otherwise, the interior is well done, nicely finished and with grab handles for everyone but the driver. Adjustable seatbelt mounts are convenient, and there is a lighted mirror in the passenger's sun visor, always an indication of luxo-thought on the part of a car's designers.
The passenger air bag is mounted in the top of the dash, and that allows for a glove box underneath, although it winds up being a narrow bin.
Outside, the heavy hood has to be lifted manually and propped up on a rod. In the case of the EX, the sideways mounted engine utilizes Honda's VTEC technology, which varies the lift and duration of the valve opening to make the car's power plant a freer breather.
On the road, the Accord wagon is much of what you want it to be, although the tires sound sharply with every expansion joint. Nevertheless, the car is tight and quiet, a compact and capable hauler that feels a lot like its sedan counterpart.
Unlike a sedan, though, the wagon offers a great deal of room behind its one-piece hatch, which rises on gas struts. Liftover is at bumper level, and the 60-40 split rear seats fold flat with the push of a button.
The rear wheel housings do intrude, and that is unfortunate. Also, the roundness that makes the new Accord wagon so attractive does have its drawbacks. You can't carry bureaus or other square stuff, and if that is part of your plan, then you will do better to look elsewhere.
On the other hand, if you have a basement full of bottles, the Accord is just your meat. In my case, too, the wagon full of containers brought me return deposits of $10.10 -- and my wife now thinks I am a can-do guy.
 
INSIDE TRACK: Honda's '94 Accord wagon is sleek, quick and easy to park. It is small and economical, but some active families may find that its lack of girth pinches more than pennies.

HEADLINE: Beyond Supermarkets: A Shopper's Guide

SERIES: Less Than Super: Second of two articles.

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS 

 BODY:
SITTING in a building in Park Slope, labeling blood oranges with stickers declaring them organically grown, Marsha Lindesay is making a grocery-political statement. So are Willie Jackson, a self-described "low-budget person" pushing a shopping cart through a warehouse hard by the Hudson in Harlem, and Anthony Liveridge, so passionate a devotee of the city's Greenmarkets that he actually tends to use the words "shopping" and "pleasant" in the same sentence.
New Yorkers love a tirade, especially about something as basic as food shopping: how crowded their supermarkets are, how messy they are, and above all, the prices they charge. And still they shop there, largely because the stores are so close by, but also because they feel they have no choice. 
 Yet each in his or her own way, Ms. Lindesay, Mr. Jackson and Mr. Liveridge -- along with many thousands of compatriots -- have declared that they do, in fact, have food-shopper's free will, that they are prisoners of the supermarkets no more.
Granted, New York, cramped and vertical New York, doesn't have much in the way of the super-supermarkets and Brobdignagian discount price clubs that the supermarket industry, eager to befriend the American consumer, has been building around the country in recent years. But throughout the city, in forms that have evolved according to the peculiar geography and psychology of New York, a growing network of alternatives does exist. (Admittedly, most don't sell everything; they are not about to put the supermarket industry out of business.)
There are food co-ops, where membership fees and volunteer labor buy democracy and organic (and often bargain-priced) groceries. There are the Greenmarkets, where the produce is farm fresh and the ethos is farm friendly. There are city versions of discount warehouses, where prices on many items are lower than in the neighborhood supermarket or specialty food stores. And there are ways of shopping without setting foot in anybody's store: over the telephone, from stores that have specialized in this kind of service for years, and from farms just getting into the business.
All of these alternatives are a response to New Yorkers' almost primordial unhappiness about their supermarkets, a feeling underscored by a New York Times computer analysis of regulatory and industry data, as well as an informal survey of markets in five city neighborhoods.
The analysis, published last week, found that many city dwellers lack the choice, comfort and variety that big chain stores can offer. Such stores are concentrated in the wealthiest neighborhoods, primarily the Upper East and West Sides, while stores in poor neighborhoods tend to be small and less well-stocked. And many city stores have a lack of creature comforts and modern technology; only half had electronic scanners, and many had aisles blocked by cartons. More than half the city's supermarkets failed state health inspections on the first round.
To the supermarket industry, the alternatives are not much to reckon with, said Howard Tisch, president of the Metropolitan Food Council, a trade organization.
"They are a competitive factor, but I don't think it's anything that's going to threaten the long-term viability of the industry," he said. Asked about the alternatives' generally consumer-friendly nature, he added: "Our stores certainly try to do that, too."
All of the alternatives share some basic business tenets: lowering prices by eliminating the middleman, and giving people a feeling that their wishes can call the shots.
And then there is the usual city-dwellers' willingness to go out of the way for things that people in most places take for granted.
"It's so pleasant to come here, for the people," said Mr. Liveridge, who traveled to the West 57th Street Greenmarket from his home on the Upper East Side. "They add flavor, character even, to the vegetables."
 
THE CO-OPS: TAKING 'CONTROL OVER THE FOOD SUPPLY'
 Back in 1973, when people talked a lot about acquiring what Joe Holtz calls "control over the food supply," not to mention saving money, Mr. Holtz and a dozen of his neighbors took over a community-center closet and formed the Park Slope Food Co-op. Today, when people talk even more about saving money, the co-op is more than 5,000 members strong and spills across more than 5,000 square feet in its own buildings at 782 Union Street.
They may sound like relics of the 60's, but food co-ops are thriving, and growing, as alternatives to supermarket shopping in the 90's. The National Cooperative Business Association says requests for informational books and videos it publishes have surged this year, with 1,000 through May, compared with 1,500 for all of last year.
"In hard economic times, co-operatives tend to grow," said Leta Mach, the association's spokeswoman, noting that while many co-ops begun in the 60's failed later, the recent incarnations are more businesslike.
At the Park Slope co-op, everything still seems to be done in the collective spirit. Mr. Holtz, though he looks like the person in command, is actually one of six co-managers. Shoppers are the workers are the managers.
The vegetarians predominate, and spanking clean produce, much of it organic, is clearly a priority, but the co-op also carries such supermarket standards as chick-
en, Kix cereal and a shelf full of Pepperidge Farm
cookies. There is no red meat, though, and no diapers. Members can request certain items, but in this super-democratic system, the others have to vote to carry them. (Steak has not come up yet, but Soy Boy Not Dogs won in a landslide.)
Prices on most items are fairly low, though organic produce is almost always more expensive than supermarket produce. The food is labeled with one price -- essentially what it costs wholesale -- and a 20 percent markup is added to most items at the checkout aisle.
On a recent visit, a bag of Terra Chips, the potato-chip alternative that usually retails for $4 and up, cost $2.81. A five-pound bag of Eastern potatoes was $1.76, compared with an average of $2.09 in Manhattan stores in The Times's informal survey, and $1.43 for stores outside Manhattan.
The co-op has paid workers, but by and large it is the members who make the show go. In addition to paying a $100 deposit for inventory and other capital expenses, they must perform about three hours of service every four weeks, from checking identification cards at the entrance (only members are welcome) to mopping floors to watching toddlers in the store's child-care center. The penalty for skipping a shift is two makeup shifts. In the last few years, membership has grown an average of 17 percent annually, Mr. Holtz said, while sales have expanded by 20 percent, to an annual $7.2 million.
Among the members working the other day was Ms. Lindesay, who lives in East Flatbush. She was part of a team assigned to label blood oranges with stickers declaring them organically grown.
"I don't shop there," Ms. Lindesay said of her neighborhood. "I can't get white cheddar cheese there, or all the cheeses you can get here."
All co-ops start small; some stay that way. Beth Steinberg, a mother of two who lives in Boerum Hill, founded a co-op of her own with five neighbors six years ago. They order and share a minimum of $350 worth of food, paying wholesale prices, from a Pennsylvania company.
"We're trying to keep it fairly mellow," Ms. Steinberg said. "I tell people to try to organize one on their own blocks."
One organization, the Hudson Valley Federation of Food Cooperatives, reachable at (914) 473-5400, offers advice on how to set up food co-ops and can refer people to existing ones near them. Bruce Meltzer, the company's marketing director, said about 60 percent of its food is sold to co-ops similar to Ms. Steinberg's, also known as buying clubs; the minimum order is $400. In a bow to technology, the company will send free software to anyone who wants to scan price lists and place orders by computer. Additional information is available from the National Cooperative Business Association in Washington, at(800) 636-6222.
 
THE WAREHOUSES: ALMOST WHOLESALE
 About 35 miles east of midtown Manhattan, in Westbury, L.I., stands the gleaming Price Club discount warehouse, where shoppers load their carts with behemoth cans of tuna, entire cases of soft drinks and 10-pound bags of onions displayed minimalistically across 110,000 square feet.
This is what America has lots of, New York's suburbs have a smattering of and the city lacks entirely: the vast warehouse stores that offer deep discounts on many foods, as long as you're willing to buy 24 bottles of ketchup at once.
But while zoning restrictions, corporate uncertainty and local opposition, not to mention an endemic lack of space, have kept such sprawling alternatives out of the city for now, a couple of local permutations have sprung up in the last couple of years.
One is By Choice, visible to drivers ricocheting off the West Side Highway at 125th Street, and pedestrians trekking westward to the river edge of West 133d Street.
Dodge the people and cars veering across the unregulated intersection of the store's parking lot and the parkway ramp. Grab a chest-high shopping cart and enter the friendly fray that is the creation of Joe Fedele, a veteran of the supermarket industry who has decided that bringing meat, produce, dairy and other groceries directly to the people is the only way to play ball. With a team of financial advisers behind him, Mr. Fedele opened his doors in February.
"Nobody likes me," Mr. Fedele said of the mainstream supermarket industry, whose prices he says he undercuts by at least 40 percent. "Distributors don't like me, and supermarkets don't like me."
By Choice occupies 43,000 feet of cavernous warehouse in the old 125th Street meat district, and, along with a winking mechanical cow, it features a vast refrigerated section, where customers can borrow hooded sweatshirts against the 37-degree cold and where everything from cheese to chicken to Smithfield ham is stacked, economy size, on industrial metal shelves.
By Choice is not Zabar's in bulk. While Mr. Fedele says he tries to stock goods that will appeal to the broad range of customers he hopes to attract, and while he is planning to add more prepared foods, foodie amenities are not his strongest suit.
"We're picking up yuppies from 125th Street down, and middle-class blacks from 125th Street up, and Dominicans from the same area," Mr. Fedele said. "But you never know how to carry every product to satisfy every ethnic mix. You have to go from the gourmet coffees to the Bustelo coffees."
And he acknowledges that he has had problems attracting some elements of the public: "Most people hear we're on 125th Street, and they freak," he says.
But ask shoppers about price and they seem genuinely thrilled.
"The prices are really good, and I'm a low-budget person," said Willie Jackson, a father of two who lives on West 162d Street.
And by and large, the prices do seem considerably lower than at local supermarkets. For example, a pound of Ronzoni spaghetti cost 89 cents, less than the Upper West Side average of $1.03 in the informal market survey; ground chuck was $1.59 a pound, compared with an Upper West Side average of $2.29; a quart of milk was 55 cents, compared with an average of 90 cents on the Upper West Side. And lobsters, which weren't included in the survey, were an inexpensive $3.99 a pound.
But a 13-ounce can of Maxwell House coffee cost $2.59, higher per ounce than the Upper West Side average of $2.91 for a 16-ounce can.
Partly in an effort to overcome his 125th Street problem, Mr. Fedele has a plan to refine his concept and sell his groceries via a combination of the information superhighway and city streets: He hopes to build a database of Manhattan customers, who will be able to place orders by computer or fax and have everything delivered that night. All that, he admits, is far in the future.
A considerably more rarified rendition of the warehouse concept is tucked along a row of art galleries and specialty shops on Wooster Street in SoHo: the Gourmet Garage, less a supermarket substitute than a 2,000-square-foot heaven for the New Yorker who wants his Morbier, and his discount, too.
"In the 90's, people don't want to change their life style, just pay less for it," says John Gottfried, one of three partners who started the store 18 months ago.
In a sense, the Gourmet Garage owes its existence and its insurgent identity to Dean & DeLuca, the temple of downtown gourmet grocery on Broadway at Prince Street.
For the last 17 years, Mr. Gottfried and partners have run a wholesale restaurant-supply business, Metropolitan Agribusiness Limited, that provides produce for restaurants like Le Cirque. One of their clients (although no longer) was Dean & DeLuca, a few steps east in SoHo. One day, one of the partners realized it would be a simple matter to stock their own store and undercut the markup, and the Gourmet Garage was born. These days, store workers, from Mr. Gottfried on down, leap at the chance to recite the price differentials between, say, their white truffle butter ($4 for a two-ounce container) and the identical brand sold at Dean & DeLuca ($5 for two ounces).
Within the next two years, the partners are planning to open five more Gourmet Garages on the Upper West and Upper East Sides; next month, the original will be moving into a 5,000-square-foot space, also in SoHo. Last month, they sold their East 91st Street branch to Eli Zabar, their landlord, who has renamed it Eli's Vinegar Factory.
While the Gourmet Garage offers downtown-area discounts on jugs of extra-virgin olive oil, homemade pesto pizzas, frozen drug-free chickens from California and slabs of imported Parmesan, it remains higher on many items than Zabar's. There, Port Salut cheese was $3.98 a pound last week, compared with $5.50 at Gourmet Garage; a box of Twinings Darjeeling teabags was $2.29, versus $2.50 at Gourmet Garage.
The other day at Gourmet Garage, the tomatoes, which Mr. Gottfried insisted had ripened on their Florida stems, were summer red and $2.50 a pound, and the shoppers interviewd declared themselves happy.
"It's very convenient, and it's do-it-yourself," said Neil Layne, who works as a furniture restorer nearby. "I don't like having to go to Dean & DeLuca and ask for everything."
He selected a loaf of bread and scooped some green and black olives from a barrel waiting for people like him to wander by.
Dean & DeLuca, meanwhile, seems rather amused by the competition. "It's basically a retail store," scoffs Michael McGovern, the assistant manager. "Last time I was in there, they had lemons at 50 cents each. Ours were better, and three for a dollar."
 
THE GREENMARKETS: FARM FRESH AND FRIENDLY
 Most of the week, Sheffield Plaza is an unremarkable, mostly concrete afterthought at the corner of Ninth Avenue and 57th Street. But on Wednesdays and Saturdays, starting at about 8 A.M., the corner is transformed into an agricultural showcase, with Rome apples and morels competing with almond tarts and leafy green lamb's-quarters for shoppers' attention and money.
The Sheffield Plaza market, opened in 1987, is part of a growing and evolving Greenmarket empire that is an eloquent expression of New Yorkers' yearning for something better when it comes to food shopping.
Today there are 19 markets in Manhattan, Brooklyn and the Bronx, with many of the newer ones in poorer neighborhoods (and one more scheduled to open this summer on Park Avenue near 115th Street). Greenmarket officials say some have doubled their daily attendance in the last two years. At the biggest, in Union Square, attendance has grown from 12,000 in 1992 to 20,000 this year.
The Sheffield Place market has the wholesome atmosphere of a country fair, and many of the little human dramas a city will provide. There is the strawberry farmer whose wife got a taste of city life and left him to drive a taxicab. There is the orchard owner who befriended one of the homeless people who frequent the plaza day and night, and ultimately put him on his apple-picking payroll.
And there is astonishing shopper loyalty, with tales of long treks made in search of the right bread, and farmers' cold winter days made bearable by donated cups of hot tea, and conversations interrupted by customers who can't stop themselves from endorsing, loud and clear, a particular farmer's mesclun.
"We get lovely fresh things here that you can't get in the supermarket," said Elaine Eklof, a music teacher who travels from Riverdale on Saturday mornings. "It's more appetizing, and it kind of has a European flavor, shopping like this."
There was even someone doing the reverse commute: Kathryn Shipman, a former New Yorker who drove in from Bayonne, N.J., to buy one of Charlie Rhodes's apple pies, baked for him by one of his rural neighbors in Highland, N.Y.
The whole urban-rural minuet doesn't always mean bargains. A price survey conducted last year by the Greenmarket organization found substantial savings on some products, like corn (31 percent cheaper than a supermarket average) and apples (29 percent). But it also found that some items cost more, like tomatoes (12 percent) and potatoes (10 percent).
The city's Greenmarkets are also being used to encourage better nutrition among poor families. People enrolled in the Federal nutrition program for women, infants and children can receive $20 a year in farmers' market coupons, which can be redeemed only for fruits and vegetables, not baked goods or jams, said Robert A. Lewis, who supervises the program for the State Department of Agriculture and Markets. Many farmers also accept food stamps, and give people tips on how to cook what they buy, Mr. Lewis said.
To build upon that, a nonprofit organization called Public Market Partners has been trying to set up farmers' markets in low-income neighborhoods. The first opened last July, at 162d Street and the Grand Concourse in the South Bronx, and the 115th Street market is to open next month, said Hillary Baum, the group's president.
"We saw it as an opportunity to attract farmers to the South Bronx," she said. "They were less reluctant to come once they knew about the coupons."
 
SPECIAL DELIVERY: JUST STAY HOME
 And then there are those New Yorkers whose solution to the supermarket problem is simply to stay home.
Through a program known as Community Supported Agriculture, one farmer in the upstate town of Claverack divides his produce among about 400 families, 175 of them in the city or just outside. It began when Jonathan Hilton, the former administrator of the city's Anthroposophical Society, which is dedicated to the work of the Austrian philosopher Rudolf Steiner, met Jean-Paul Cortens, a farmer who shared his ideal of city dwellers having a close relationship with growers.
The first season was five years ago, with 55 families participating, and now there are 175 families. "It provides a real human connection with the source of your food," Mr. Hilton said.
Every spring, Mr. Cortens collects payments of $250 each from the city families. Starting in June and continuing through the autumn, he pays them back with produce he drives to the Church of ST. Paul and St. Andrew at 86th Street and West End Avenue on Thursday afternoons.
Other farmers participate in the program as well; information is available at (800) 516-7797.
Another source, one that requires no prepayment, is the American Family Farm, which sells mostly New York and Connecticut-grown products. By calling the 2-year-old Amenia, N.Y., company at (800) NY-FARMS, New Yorkers can arrange for delivery of bottled milk and other dairy products, fresh and frozen meat, poultry and game, seasonal produce and condiments to their doors. The company delivers in Manhattan three days a week for a $4.75 fee (the minimum order is $25). Prices are definitely higher than you'd pay at a supermarket: $1.89 a quart for skim or whole milk, plus a $1 bottle deposit.
The farms and Greenmarkets, of course, offer only certain kinds of groceries. The ultimate escape can be found at the old-line Upper East Side markets that will do virtually all your shopping for you.
One such store is the 62-year-old Gentile's Market at 1045 Madison Avenue, at 80th Street, where about 350 people have accounts and call in their requests. There is no charge for delivery, but Anthony Gentile, the third generation of his family in the business, estimates prices are about 15 percent higher than in the supermarket.
"You would spend $85 in a supermarket for what costs $100 here, but it's an animal farm in there," said Mr. Gentile (preferably pronounced jen-TEA-lay or jen-TEAL, but often mispronounced JEN-tile by New Yorkers). "We'll get customers calling us sometimes from their boats at 7:30 in the morning, saying I'm coming in, can you send up this or that?" One customer calls from California, asking Mr. Gentile to Federal Express him cookies he can't find on the Coast.
When Mr. Gentile was growing up (he is now 43), nearly every corner had its version of the "box grocery" business. Now they are few and far between. Two others are Butterfield Market, at 1114 Lexington Avenue, near 78th Street, and Paradise Market, nearby at 1081 Lexington Avenue and 1100 Madison, near 83d.
"People like service," said Alan Obsatz, a co-owner of Butterfield, "and that's what we cater to."
Those customers, however, do know the value of a dollar. "If they're not satisfied, they let us know," Mr. Gentile said. "We have people who bring us back half a melon."

CORRECTION-DATE: June 26, 1994, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
An entry in the "And Bear in Mind" listing on June 5 about "D-Day, June 6, 1944," by Stephen E. Ambrose, misstated the numbers of men and vehicles landed by the Allies on the first day of the invasion of Normandy. Scholars' estimates vary, but Mr. Ambrose believes there were about 175,000 men; his estimate for vehicles of all kinds, from bicycles to tanks, is 50,000.

HEADLINE: 50 Years After D-Day, an Aircraft Industry Remade

BYLINE: By PATRICK J. LYONS 

 BODY:
AS Allied commanders prepared to retake Europe, Asia and the Pacific from the Fascist powers five decades ago, the first place they knew they had to win was in the air. The German blitzkrieg, Pearl Harbor, the Battle of Britain and Midway all demonstrated that air power, a side show in World War I, was crucial to victory in World War II.
Aviation captured the imagination of American generals, inventors, industrialists and the public alike in those dark war years, in a way few industries have, before or since. Aircraft went from being expensive toys to weapons of liberty overnight. Schoolchildren avidly studied recognition silhouettes and knew the names and strengths of dozens of planes. Pioneers of flight like Glenn Curtiss, Jack Northrop and Glenn Martin found themselves at the helm of burgeoning empires. And almost anyone who knew something about planes -- mechanic, stunt pilot, engineer, factory foreman -- could start a company and hope for a Government contract. 
 By D-Day, 50 years ago tomorrow, American factories were turning out about 250 warplanes a day, compared with 10 a day in 1938, the year before the war began in Europe. By war's end, the United States had built 300,000 aircraft, and the aviation industry was the biggest in the country by dollar volume of output.
This prodigious production was instrumental in sweeping the Axis air forces from the battlefield by the summer of 1944. Indeed, only with such air superiority could Allied commanders allow the biggest invasion fleet ever assembled to set forth toward Normandy.
But while plane manufacturers helped win the war -- and a big place in the wartime economy -- many found the peace that followed to be a dangerous time.
Aviation had already proved itself an industry of booms and slumps. After World War I, the War Department canceled aircraft contracts so abruptly that the industry shrank by 90 percent in less than a year, and many producers were forced into mergers or receivership. Civil aviation was just catching on when the stock market collapsed in 1929, causing more consolidation.
When it was clear the tide in World War II had turned, twice-burned aviation veterans started planning for peace, and persuaded the Federal Government to cut back a little more gradually this time around. Some companies went under anyway, some made fortunes or lost them pursuing civilian markets, some followed advancing technology into helicopters, missiles and space hardware, and some made a living out of the smaller but still substantial military market. But few made it as far as 1970, let alone 1994, without changes in name, ownership, management or focus -- or all four.
The end of the cold war triggered yet another round of consolidation, which culminated in Northrop's purchase of Grumman this spring. Widespread layoffs in the industry even claimed the jobs at Douglas Aircraft of a son and grandson of Donald Douglas, founder of the company, by then a division of McDonnell Douglas. Today, almost all the famous, romantic names from the skies of D-Day are drastically altered or gone.
The industry has changed in many other ways as well. Military airframe construction -- putting a plane together from components made in-house or by others -- is now a low-volume business with a handful of very expensive planes built each year, and the companies that remain often work together. Two survivors -- Boeing and McDonnell Douglas -- still have significant civil aircraft programs, though McDonnell is hard pressed to make any money at it. Two others -- the combinations of Northrop, Grumman and Vought and of Lockheed and Convair -- do business almost exclusively with The Customer, as those in the industry often refer to the various arms of the Federal Government, and with friendly governments overseas.
The chart below traces in simplified form the fates of the major prime contractors for military aircraft from World War II to today, highlighting important mergers and some famous planes along the way.
For simplicity, the chart draws a distinction between airplanes and helicopters and concentrates on planes, because helicopters played a negligible role in World War II. From a business point of view the distinction is less meaningful now. And the chart for the most part ignores the growing role and interconnectedness of subcontractors. But it gives a broad picture of the drastic depopulation of military aviation, in waves, since D-Day.

HEADLINE: Whither the Mob? 12 Defendants Plead Poverty and Ask Court for Lawyers

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, June 4

 BODY:
In what experts on organized crime are citing as evidence of the Mafia's decline here, 12 of 24 men recently arraigned on racketeering charges declared themselves indigent and accepted court-appointed lawyers.
 "This says to me it isn't much of a mob anymore," said Fred Martens, executive director of the Pennsylvania Crime Commission, which monitors organized crime. "The mob isn't taking care of its underlings the way it used to. In the old days, if a mobster got arrested, the mob took care of his legal fees and his family if he went to jail. The crime family really isn't a family in Philadelphia anymore." 
Mafia families are having trouble all over the country, said Alan Ellis, a former president of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers who practices in Philadelphia and San Diego.
 "The Government keeps saying they have smashed the mob, and lawyers who represent organized-crime figures have privately told me that the prosecutors are telling the truth," Mr. Ellis said. "Lawyers who once made a steady diet of this type of work are having to diversify."
 
A Leader and His Lawyer
 On March 17, Federal agents arrested virtually all of Philadelphia's top mobsters, including John Stanfa, described as the mob's leader here, and Salvatore Avena, a former deputy state attorney general who was Mr. Stanfa's lawyer. Prosecutors say that Mr. Avena was also Mr. Stanfa's adviser on mob business, including the planning of murders.
 Mr. Stanfa, Mr. Avena and 10 other defendants retained their own lawyers. All have said that they are not guilty. Their trials will probably not be held until next year.
 The other defendants, among them men who said they were a short-order cook, a deli owner and an unemployed handyman, accepted court-appointed lawyers.
 
Underbosses and Soldiers
 Joel M. Friedman, chief of the Organized Crime Division of the United States Attorney's Office here, described these defendants as a cross section of the local mob, ranging from underbosses to Mafia soldiers to associate members.
 Mr. Friedman, who has won dozens of convictions in two other major racketeering cases against the local Mafia since 1980, sees the declarations of indigency as a sign that his work is paying off, although he suggests that some defendants may have money hidden away. Judges examined the affidavits and questioned the defendants about their finances, but did not formally investigate their accuracy, Mr. Friedman said.
 The defendants were charged with racketeering-related crimes, including murder, kidnapping, extortion and arson. Three have cooperated with the Government; one has pleaded guilty and awaits sentencing.
 The primary evidence in the case came from nearly 1,800 hours of conversations that Federal agents secretly recorded in Mr. Avena's law office in Camden, N.J. In 30 months of surveillance, prosecutors say, mob members spoke openly about their activities, apparently assuming that agents would be unable to secure court authorization to put listening devices in a lawyer's office.
 Anticipating a challenge based on attorney-client privilege, prosecutors recently gave the defense attorneys 8,000 legal documents and transcripts of some of the recorded conversations supporting their investigation.
 
'He Wasn't in Any Mob'
 Hope C. Lefeber, a court-appointed lawyer, said her client, Gary Tavella, who owns a deli, did not fit popular Mafia stereotypes. "My client may have hung out with mobsters, but he wasn't in any mob," Ms. Lefeber said. "He worked hard, long hours in his deli and rehabbing houses. This guy doesn't have any money."
 Ms. Lefeber will be paid the court's standard rate of $40 an hour for preparing the case and $60 an hour in court -- less than a third of what several lawyers say are the going rates for a criminal defense here.
 Ms. Lefeber has practiced criminal law for 15 years and represented a Mafia member in a previous racketeering case, but not all lawyers who accept court appointments have that much experience. Court-appointed lawyers also face strict limits on defense expenses, including the hiring of expert witnesses and investigators.
 Crime of the sort that the Government said these defendants practiced does not pay very much, Ms. Lefeber said. "This mob case does not involve drugs, where the money is," she said. "It's about extortion and bookmaking, and that's chicken feed."
 
A Brief Kidnapping
 Prosecutors charged Mr. Tavella, 35, with four counts of racketeering, involving among other things the brief kidnapping of a rival mobster's associate, who has since fled to Italy. If convicted on all counts, Mr. Tavella faces up to $1 million in fines and 65 years in prison. Ms. Lefeber said a kidnapping charge involving the same incident was dismissed in a state court last year at a trial in which Mr. Tavella was convicted on a related charge of gun possession and sentenced to probation.
 Prosecutors said they charged Mr. Tavella after recording him discussing details of the kidnapping in Mr. Avena's office.
 Jeffrey M. Lindy, an Assistant United States Attorney here from 1989 to 1992, was appointed to represent Thomas Rebbie, 65, who listed his occupation as unemployed handyman. Mr. Rebbie, described as a mob associate, was charged with two counts of conspiracy, involving a murder and an attempted murder. He has agreed to testify against the other defendants, and Mr. Lindy has negotiated a plea agreement, whose terms have not been disclosed.
 "As his attorney, I can say absolutely that he qualifies for a court-appointed attorney," Mr. Lindy said. "He's done odd jobs for a very long time, and he doesn't have any finances."
 Mr. Friedman of the United States Attorney's Office said the indigent defendants were not just hangers-on but career criminals. Still, he acknowledged, "To the extent that one credits their affidavits of indigency, one would have to conclude that they were less than successful in their careers."

HEADLINE: Two L.I. Film Festivals Enjoying New Stature

BYLINE: By MARJORIE KAUFMAN 

 BODY:
FILM makers are looking over their shoulders, panning and focusing on Long Island.
The Long Island Film Festival, opening tomorrow at the Cinema Arts Center in Huntington, may be an appetizer for the feast beginning on Oct. 19 at the Hamptons International Film Festival, said Christopher Cooke, director of the Suffolk County Motion Picture-TV Bureau and Office of Cultural Affairs. 
 With a fraction of the Hamptons budget and no direct relation to each other, the festivals promote the cinema as an art form, independent and student film makers and the industry on the Island.
Interest in filming on Long Island heightened in 1979, when New York City became a costly and complicated site to film, Mr. Cooke said. Other states formed film commissions, and Suffolk County created its under the Office of Economic Development, as an advisory board to offer regional resources to increase film and television activity.
"By 1987," Mr. Cooke said, "just after the filming of 'Wall Street' on Long Island, the Island saw its biggest boom, earning nearly $60 million from the film industry."
The chairman of the commission, Thomas J. Junor, said the county was spending $8,000 this year on the Long Island festival, double the budget of last year.
The diversity of locations -- choice scenery, open spaces and historic buildings -- add up to making Long Island ideal for the industry, he added. Warner Brothers is considering Westbury Gardens as a setting for scenes in "Batman 3," and "Moon of Honor," an independent feature by Schofield Films is before the cameras in Montauk with Edie Falco of Northport.
"By showing our support," Mr. Junor said, "we are saying to the young film makers, 'We have an industry here that can use your talent.' "
The commission is now joined by the new Long Island Film and TV Foundation to be a co-sponsor of the festival and promote year-round seminars, workshops and fund-raising events.
Mr. Cooke added: "Many of the New York film schools are producing film makers willing to do projects on a shoestring, because they can't wait to break into the system. It's become an epidemic, because there have been enough successes."
A major role model for independent film makers on the Island is Hal Hartley of Lindenhurst, who in 1991 made a low-budget film, "Simple Men," that received critical praise. In 1985, Mr. Hartley entered a short in the Long Island festival, and this year his "Amateur" was one of two American independent works shown at the Directors' Fortnight in Cannes.
Mr. Cooke said the original one-night Suffolk Film Festival was intended to be a showcase for film students, mostly from Long Island. "It has been an 11-year p.r. campaign to promote Suffolk County as a user-friendly place for the film industry, which has shown a consistently supportive, positive economic impact," he said. The event is broadening its base by changing its name to the Long Island Film Festival.
"Changing a name this year opens up the festival and also points to the importance of the independent film, as opposed to the studio film," Vic Skolnick, co-owner of the Cinema Arts Center, said. "It reflects the extended programming and is a regional showcase for new innovative works from the U.S. and, in some cases, international independent film makers."
The films to be screened represent the "Best of Fest," Mr. Cooke said, including tomorrow night's "River of Grass" by Kelly Reichardt, which was shown this year at the Sundance Festival. The Berlin International Film Festival in February presented "Criminal," directed by David Jacobson, a black-and-white "road movie" to be screened from tomorrow through Thursday night in Huntington. The film makers will lead discussions after the evening screenings.
Last October, the first Hamptons International Film Festival had a $500,000 budget and attracted 14,000 viewers to see 80 films, including features and shorts from 13 countries, in five days. Stephen Spielberg and Martin Scorcese participated in seminars.
"The Hamptons International Film Festival is poised to be a world-class festival," said Peter Glatzer, a festival organizer formerly at the Independent Feature Project in New York City and the new executive director at the Hampton series.
Many film festivals have begun in the last decade. The Hamptons "raison d'etre," the artistic director, Darryl Macdonald, said, is its educational commitment. "We heavily promote new film makers by educational programs, including $25,000 in scholarships. We are looking to the future and seeding the film-production scene for new talent to emerge."
More than 200 film makers submitted entries to the Long Island festival this year. Just the finalists -- more than 20 shorts and 8 features -- will be shown. There are three locations, Theater 3 in Port Jefferson, Guild Hall in East Hampton and the Cinema Arts Center.
"This year we have some of the highest quality films showing," said Myrna Gordon, who was a co-founder of the Village Cinema in Port Jefferson in 1986 and is a co-producer of the festival.
"By high quality, I mean in terms of production value, acting integrity, story line and artistic creativity. 'No Man's Land,' a short by Craig Shepherd, is a perfect example. These are our future film makers, the next wave."
For young film makers, successful shorts can be calling cards for features. In Europe shorts enjoy a larger market. They are commonly screened before feature films.
Mr. Shepherd, of Port Jefferson Station, is a graduate student at the New York University Film School. His short will be screened Wednesday at 9:45 P.M. and Thursday at 3:15 in Huntington. "It is a highly authentic period piece set in the 1930's, down to the costuming and vintage cars," Ms. Gordon said.
"The Suffolk Film Commission and the people of the Port Jefferson community were unbelievably generous," Mr. Shepherd said. "The Mayor shut down Main Street for six hours one Sunday for filming."
"The Last Good Breath," a short by Kimberly Ane Pierce of Port Washington, a student at ColumbiaUniversity, drew on inspiration from a trip to Japan. While filming at the Sands Point Preserve, she used an abandoned beach at Plum Point to portray a war-torn setting. The film is mythical, an irreconcilable love affair based on not only images and metaphors, but also on emotional overtones set by music and photography, Ms. Pierce said.
Bob Gosse of Lindenhurst grew up working on films with Mr. Hartley, his cousin. Mr. Gosse, who graduated in 1986 from the film school at the State University at Purchase College, was a co-founder in 1991 of the Shooting Gallery, with Larry Meistritch, a college friend.
"The Shooting Gallery is alternative space for low-budget film makers to work," Mr. Gosse said. "We have grown out of our original building and are temporarily located in Greenwich Village. But we are in the process of acquiring a larger building one that was Andy Warhol's former space."
"Handgun," a feature showing tomorrow through Thursday in Hungtin is produced by Mr. Gosse, written by Whitney Ransick and stars Treat Williams. It was shown at the Santa Barbara, Calif., International Film Festival this year. " 'Handgun' was filmed in Long Island City, where we try to create a never-world landscape to mirror the action-heist genre of the early 1970's films."
The independent film maker and the film industry have taken root on the Island. "It's a fertile field," Mr. Skolnick said. "It acts as a magnet where distributors are locating the new talent."

HEADLINE: New Jersey Q & A: Linda Mysliwy Conlin;
Keeping the State Attractive to Tourists

BYLINE: By ARTHUR Z. KAMIN 

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
NOW that Memorial Day has marked the unofficial start of the important summer travel season in a job-and-economy-conscious New Jersey, there is a broad and a confident smile on Linda Mysliwy Conlin's face.
"As always, the weather will be the deciding factor -- but I would say we are going to have a very good year, dominated by the World Cup soccer games at the Meadowlands," said Ms. Conlin, the state's travel and tourism director. 
 But, she said, answering concerns that the Jersey Shore and especially Atlantic City get preferential treatment from the state, "there is much to be done so that all of the six tourism regions in New Jersey will share in the benefits."
Ms. Conlin's name is not necessarily a household word. She is relatively unknown even in the still vast bureaucracies of a state government slowly starting to shrink -- that is, except for her division. Its economic importance has been emphasized by state officials including the Governor, not surprisingly since tourism is an $18-billion-a-year industry in New Jersey.
Ms. Conlin, 46, was appointed to her $80,000-a-year post in March. She is a 20-year veteran in tourism and related fields.
"Linda Conlin is a first-rate professional," said Gloria E. Soto, president of the 200-member New Jersey Travel Industry Association and a vice president of the Claridge Hotel Casino in Atlantic City.
 
Role in Washington
 Ms. Conlin's career began in her family-owned Massachusetts travel agency. Later, she served as the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for tourism marketing in Washington for three and a half years.
"I have met a payroll as the owner of a small business, and I have welcomed chiefs of state and heads of government," she said. "I see some truly outstanding opportunities in new Jersey, especially in the area of the international traveler market."
Ms. Conlin said she knew she was starting off with a "world-class tourist attraction winner" at the World Cup soccer games at Giants Stadium starting June 18, with seven games going through July 13. "It will be an extraordinary opportunity to showcase our state as a vacation destination and as a place to welcome business," she said.
 
Longer Visits Sought
 But that's not enough for Ms. Conlin. Her division, a part of the State Department of Commerce and Economic Development, has embarked on strategies to get the soccer visitors, coming from throughout the world, to travel beyond the Meadowlands.
"There is not a more diverse, a more beautiful state in the nation," she said. "There is so much to see and do in New Jersey. I am hoping our visitors will extend their stays here."
Ms. Conlin said she was going to help them find New Jersey's historic sites, beaches, mountains, science center, aquarium, college towns, state and national parks, museums, theme parks, concert halls, theaters, bed-and-breakfast inns and old lighthouses.
"Enough was not done in that area in the past," she said. She is drawing up a new plan for increased advertising, promotion, special events and an emphasis at trade shows on the "complete New Jersey." The full benefits of the plan will not be realized until next year, she added.
That approach is winning Ms. Conlin support at the tourism round tables, especially those off the beaten track, she is conducting throughout the state.
She has appeared in the six tourism regions -- Shore, Gateway, Skylands, Delaware River, Greater Atlantic City and Southern Shore -- speaking to groups of as many as a hundred that consisted of hotel and tourist-attraction owners, representatives of local and county governments and officials of chambers of commerce.
Paula J. Williams, a co-owner of the Whistling Swan, a 10-room bed-and-breakfast in Stanhope and president of the 80-member Bed and Breakfast Innkeepers Association, said, "It's nice to know we are not forgotten here in Sussex County, the home of what I like to call eco-tourism."
Competition has been keen among the tourism regions, and Ms. Conlin said it might be time to take a new look at the structure to bring about greater cooperation.
Malena Pierson, manager of the Coach and Four restaurant adjacent to the turnpike on the Hightstown-East Windsor line, said: "She's on the right track. There is more to New Jersey than Atlantic City. Hightstown is a historical area -- but it has to be promoted."
Leonard C. Horn, president and chief executive officer of the Miss America Organization, parent of the Miss America Pageant in the Convention Center, said he would be working with Ms. Conlin on plans for what he called a "major tourist draw," the event's 75th anniversary next year.
"We're going to have all of the living Miss Americas back in Atlantic City," he said. "This is going to get worldwide attention."
Mr. Horn said the pageant accounts for "in excess of $30 million a year to the South Jersey economy."
Q. Can we hear more about your predictions for the tourism season?
A. All indications are that 1994 will be at least as successful as the 1993 season. All of the beaches are reporting clear, clean water conditions. Hotel and rental bookings seem to be on the rise. Attractions and amusements are completing major renovations and expansions in anticipation of increased visitors.
Q. What have you done to insure its success?
A. I have been getting to know New Jersey's tourism industry through numerous meetings, round-table idea exchanges with the regions and open dialogues with the industry.
These meetings are being conducted as an extension of Governor Whitman's commitment to reaching out into the community for input to be used as the basis for strategic planning and programming. Information gathered will be integrated into the methods used to guarantee successful tourism seasons.
Q. Any trends we should know about?
A. The trend developing in New Jersey is consistent with that surfacing throughout the country: people are looking for good vacation dollar values and a diverse family vacation experience. At the end of last year's summer season, we surveyed a cross section of businesses and found all segments noted the same observations: there were more families, young people and children.
Q. How important is tourism to the state and its economy?
A. Tourism is one of the state's leading industries, top employers and major revenue generators. There were 136 million trips taken to New Jersey. These visitors generated $18 million in expenditures and created 346,000 jobs with a payroll of $7.6 billion. Every advertising dollar invested in New Jersey tourism generates a $100 return.
Q. With all the state cutbacks, is your division really needed? Isn't it a good candidate for privatization?
A. New Jersey's tourism industry, attractions, destinations and industry partners are diverse and varied. There needs to be a nonpartisan representation of all parties involved in the industry. The division is this voice. We represent and speak for the different segments of the industry, coordinating them into a singular, manageable entity.
Q. International visitors are said to be the fastest-growing segment in the travel industry. What are your plans to capture that market?
A. Our international tourism marketing has already begun in full force. The division's travel trade manager attended major shows in primary markets to promote New Jersey. This concentrated effort will continue through the World Cup championships as we tap into the captive audiences in the countries that will be playing preliminary and semifinal round matches here.
Q. With all the present and proposed gambling competition, how do you view Atlantic City's future?
A. Diversification is the key. The region and the city leaders recognize Atlantic City must follow in the footsteps that Las Vegas is forging. There already are plans in place to package Atlantic City with other attractions throughout the state.
Q. Despite some noble improvement efforts, many people say Atlantic City still appears to have a shabby image. Will you have any voice in turning that perception around?
A. I would like to be involved but have not identified a role for the division as yet. I am sure a cooperative relationship will be established and the division will play a significant role.

HEADLINE: Iona Graduates With Guaranteed Jobs

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER 

DATELINE: NEW ROCHELLE

 BODY:
TWENTY-SIX members of the Iona class of '94 who received their M.B.A.'s at commencement exercises at the college on May 21 have already had several good job offers. The jobs are in Noyabrsk, an oil-producing city in western Siberia, where the recent Russian graduates, now armed with the latest business-management skills and their master's degrees, intend to apply the principles and dynamics of a market-driven economy to various enterprises in Russia.
Dr. Charles F. O'Donnell, dean of the Hagan School of Business at the college, said that the group, made up of 17 men and 5 women, was the first to graduate from the innovative M.B.A. program that has been offered jointly by the Hagan School at Iona, the Plekhanov Academy, which is Moscow's leading management institute, and Sinerghia, a private management organization in Moscow. 
 "The Iona M.B.A. program in Moscow was started with the assistance and initiative of Dr. Ehiel Ash, associate professor of accounting, and Dr. Eduardo Paderon, associate dean, and members of our faculty," Dr. O'Donnell said. "Dr. Ash is recognized as one of the leading authorities on accounting in the Soviet Union and a former professor of accounting at Moscow's Plekhanov Academy and the author of accounting textbooks still used there.
"It was through his contacts, four years ago, that Iona sponsored the first business program for training Soviet executives to move into the free-enterprise economy. The new M.B.A. program is a logical outgrowth of the relationship we have built up with Russia."
The program, Dr. O'Donnell said, is an accelerated one-year, 54-credit, degree program offered in four trimesters, with the final trimester spent on the Iona campus in New Rochelle, where Russian students live in dormitories. In addition to their studies, they are required to work for an American company as an intern.
Dr. O'Donnell, Dr. Ash and Dr. Paderon traveled to Russia several times to make arrangements before the program was started in Moscow last fall. Dr. Paderon, the program director, and Dr. Ash temporarily moved to Moscow where they were joined by other Iona professors and adjunct faculty members from Plekhanov Academy and Sinerghia.
Candidates applying for the program were required to have some proficiency in English, a bachelor's degree or its equivalent or a higher degree, letters of reference and a personal interview.
"More than 100 candidates applied, many of them with advanced degrees in such disciplines as petroleum engineering, economics and accounting, and they were already working in their fields," Dr. Ash said. "It was hard to make the selection because so many of them were highly qualified."
The students, he reported, all came from Noyabrsk -- which has a population of about 100,000 -- because its mayor, Alexander Busalov, saw the program as a way to insure the future of the city's economy in the global market. What is especially interesting, Dr. Paderon said, is that Noyabrsk was a secret town, completely concealed by the Soviet regime so that it never appeared on a map or atlas until recently.
 
Time for Reflection
 Dr. Ash said: "The Mayor believes so strongly that the program would help prepare the students, many of whom work at the major employer, Neftegeophizika Oil and Gas Company, for future leadership positions, that he asked at a meeting that the city officials invest $300,000 to pay the students' fees." The city fathers agreed, he said, possibly because the oil company is in the process of privatization from 100 percent state ownership to 49 percent private ownership. Stock in the company was sold for the first time last December. Dr. Ash added, "The Mayor was wise enough to know that new skills are required to survive in a global economy."
On the day before graduation, just before the group was given a farewell barbecue at the Rockland County home of Dr. Paderon, they assembled in a classroom at Iona for the last time to reflect on their experiences.
Galina Sulimova, a 24-year-old mining engineer and geologist, said, "I, for one, was very happy with the studies, because my ambition is to work internationally for the oil company, and first I had to learn how the free-enterprise system operates."
 
'We Have No Checks'
 Natalya Seskutova, 26, a chief economist at the oil company, said she wanted to learn how to organize transportation systems. "I experienced myself how a big American company operates because I was given an internship at Trans America Leasing Company, and in my studies I learned budgeting and accounting procedures -- which are used here -- which is important because when I go home," she said. "I am hoping to establish transportation joint ventures with other countries. I was impressed with the progressive culture of America, which I did not expect."
Other internships in the region were provided by Nynex, Holiday Inn-Crowne Plaza Hotel, Natwest Bank and the Union State Bank in Nanuet.
Vladislav Seskutov, 23, an engineer who said he intends to pursue a career organizing and administering privately owned oil- and gas-extracting companies, said: "I had an internship at the Union State Bank. It was so interesting for me to observe how a bank in a free economy operates. I especially was fascinated by the procedures with checking. In Russia, we have no checks. I never had seen one until I came here."
Sergey Vinogradov, who is 30 and a production mining engineer, said he was most interested in subjects dealing with financial management and accounting procedures. "I would like to go back to my job at the oil company and be able to use my knowledge to make it run more efficiently and to make better use of people," Mr. Vinogradov said. "We in Russia will now be competing in the global market, and we will have to have the same skills people in other countries have if we want to succeed."
 
Progressiveness Makes Impression
 When some of the students were asked what they found most enjoyable about their stay in the United States, Mr. Vinogradov replied: "The tour to Atlantic City. I won $65, and that made me very happy."
Mr. Seskutov said: "I enjoyed everything here. I made many American friends, compared cultures with them, and I had a wonderful stay."
And so did Ms. Sulimova and Ms. Seskutova. "For me it was a great experience," Ms. Sulimova said. "My internship was at United Parcel Service in Manhattan, and I even delivered a package. What I was impressed with was the high status the managers gave the workers. They were equals." Ms. Seskutova said she enjoyed the tours, especially those to museums, General Motors in Tarrytown and the New York Stock Exchange. "I was impressed with the progressiveness and the culture in America," she added.
 
An Exciting Opportunity
 The future Russian business leaders are back home now, said Dr. Paderon, adding that Mayor Busalov told him that they can apply for any job they want.
"They are now equipped to help an emerging entrepreneurial nation adopt the free-enterprise system," Dr. Paderon said. "It is a tremendously exciting opportunity for us at Iona to help shape a new generation of leaders in Russia and the emerging new republics of what was the former Soviet Union."
Dr. Paderon added that he had forged strong ties with the students during their time here and already misses them.
"They were so enthusiastic about all things American, from the appliances in the dormitory to the barbecue we held for them," he said. "What I think is valuable is they will go back home and tell others who we are here as a people. Their eyes widened, I remember, when they saw that we had a swimming pool at our house, and I could sense that already they were beginning to think like entrepreneurs."

HEADLINE: Paper Tigers -- and Real Ones

BYLINE: By James Fallows; James Fallows is author of "Looking at the Sun: The Rise of the New East Asian Economic and Political System."

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The conventional wisdom is that the Clinton Administration has horribly bungled its dealings with East Asia. It has surrendered to China on human rights, it has zigged and zagged in its trade strategy with Japan, it has temporized with North Korea and in general it has illustrated what "policy disarray" means.
The reality is both better and worse. It is better in that the Administration has avoided several pitfalls in Asia and has attained several significant goals. It is worse in that the challenges soon to come from East Asia will involve issues more fundamental than one U.S. President's operating style. 
 The Administration may be shy about emphasizing its recent successes with Asia because each is embarrassing or awkward to mention. For example, ending the trade embargo against Vietnam increased America's economic and political leverage in Asia, but President Clinton probably prefers not to highlight anything involving Vietnam.
A more significant achievement is the new "framework" agreement for trade with Japan. For decades, U.S. and Japanese negotiators have wrangled over which was more important -- how hard Japan tried to open its markets, or what the results of those efforts were. A year ago, the U.S. announced that it would concentrate on results, not efforts.
Last month, behind a variety of face-saving pleasantries, Japan finally agreed to this approach. The camouflage consisted mainly of U.S. promises not to use any one number in measuring results, as the Reagan Administration had done with semiconductors. Instead, the U.S. will combine several measures. But since the Japanese Government had spent the previous months declaring that it would never, ever agree to a "results" approach, the Clinton Administration is now tactfully soft-pedaling what it achieved.
Even the end of the Administration's China drama was something other than the humiliating sellout generally portrayed in the American press. Here the problem was the President's 1993 promise to remove China's "most favored nation" trade status if the regime did not liberalize.
From the moment that promise was made, it was viewed throughout East Asia as being unenforceable. Denying the trade privileges would be a declaration of economic war: almost the only countries that don't enjoy such benefits are those whose governments the U.S. has tried to overthrow, like Cuba and North Korea. Neither China nor its neighbors believed that the U.S. was ready for such an all-out confrontation with China. The President made himself and the country seem less paper-tigerish by getting out of this unwise commitment. But since he set the trap in the first place, he can hardly brag about the escape.
Now the real difficulties begin, based not on subtleties of U.S. policy but on fundamental changes in economic strength. The two great phenomena of modern Asia -- its rapid growth and its increasing regional integration -- will lead to more and more political showdowns with the U.S.
America's relief at Japan's supposed economic collapse has dulled awareness of how powerfully the whole East Asian region continues to grow. Savings rates in East Asia are, on average, three times as high as in the U.S. Asia's share of the world's investable capital has more than doubled in the last decade. East Asian countries are the world's main growth markets for airplanes, cars, cellular phones and construction equipment.
It is because Japanese companies dominate these Asian markets so thoroughly -- just look at the cars on the jammed roads of Thailand and Indonesia -- that they have maintained their global market share in most manufacturing industries despite the slowdown at home.
Most East Asian countries still rely on the U.S. as their most important customer. Last year Japan had a trade surplus of more than $50 billion with the U.S.; taken together, the rest of the region did, too.
Yet in every one of these countries, trade with America is falling in relative importance, and trade within Asia continues to grow. Japan sends twice as large a share of its foreign investment to Asia as it did a decade ago, and has as large a trade surplus with the rest of Asia as with the U.S. Companies in South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong have set up branches in China, Malaysia and Vietnam.
Despite the jealousies and differences that separate Japan from China or Thailand from Vietnam, their economies also share a consciousness of having history on their side -- which makes them more assertive about redressing history's grievances. A principal grievance, barely recognized in the U.S., involves the centuries in which first Europe and then America set the rules for international behavior.
What was "fair" in world trade, what was "humane" in domestic policies, was defined by the Westerners, with their machines and money. When Asian governments fell short of these standards -- locking up dissidents, rigging trade to promote their own industries -- they had to apologize for not yet having evolved to full, Western refinement.
Now the apologies are over. On matters from dealing with vandals to censoring newspapers, some Asian governments are assertive about having found what they consider a better way. Many Westerners assume that as societies prosper they will inevitably become more liberal. In parts of Asia this may turn out be true. For instance, in South Korea, Christianity raises a serious challenge to the power of the state. But in many other countries -- Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia -- an "enlightened authoritarianism," which enriches the economy while limiting individual rights, could last for years and years.
The Asian episodes of the last few months, from caning in Singapore to trade benefits for China, give Washington a taste of what it will be like to coexist with this increasingly self-confident system. For the U.S., the easiest part of the job will be dealing with trade disputes. Though East Asia's economic strength is the source of its political confidence, trade complaints do not strike at the heart of a country's internal order. Washington could impose sanctions on Beijing for wholesale copyright piracy or other aggressive trade practices without provoking the snarling response of the "most favored nation" controversy.
Defending Western political values will be harder and will require a shift in the American mentality. The U.S. often chooses not to intervene -- in Hungary in 1956, in Bosnia and Rwanda today -- but our political culture often assumes that America could win any fight or change any outcome if it chose to.
For the foreseeable future, the U.S. cannot control the politics of East Asia. It cannot directly force China to liberalize. It cannot prevent a shift of economic momentum to a region that is now celebrating authoritarianism.
America will have to learn how to keep speaking up for liberal values and devising indirect means to advance them, knowing that in the short run, no matter how skillful its leaders, it will probably fail.

HEADLINE: Retooling Ideas To Conform With Clean Air Act

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

 BODY:
ALL through the recent recession, business kept booming at the Zierick Manufacturing Corporation in Mount Kisco, where 110 employees produce car parts and electronic connectors. Indeed, since it opened shop 74 years ago, few outside forces have been able to stunt the growth of this family-owned company.
But now all that may be changing -- although not as a result of a shifting economy. Rather, provisions of the Federal Clean Air Act, due to be implemented within the next several years, may prove too onerous for small businesses like Zierick Manufacturing. 
 Gretchen Zierick, secretary of the corporation, said the plant would either move to a state where the law does not apply or it would reduce its payroll to avoid complying with the regulations, which affect companies with 100 or more employees.
"One thing is certain -- we certainly won't be growing in New York State anymore," said Ms. Zierick, whose grandfather started the company in the Bronx in 1919.
Although the plant is large enough to be included under the Clean Air Act, Ms. Zierick said it was nevertheless too small to bear expenses associated with implementing the law -- which could mean purchasing vans for employee commuting pools or paying workers to take mass transportation, even though some of those expenses are tax deductible. She said that while the company had traditionally avoided layoffs, it might decide to reduce its staff now to prevent government regulations from eating profits.
At the county's Office of Economic Development, Margaret S. Soter, director of commerce and economic development, said many of the larger corporations in the county were already studying ways to reduce commuter traffic to their work sites. But some of the smaller companies -- often referred to by Ms. Soter as the backbone of Westchester's economy -- were worried and had been phoning her office with their concerns.
"We know there will be fallout from this law, that some will be affected adversely," Ms. Soter said. "We are trying to make the law less onerous, but we realize that some companies may choose to go elsewhere."
Testing by the Environmental Protection Agency showed that the New York City region -- which includes New York, Connecticut and New Jersey -- had excessively high quantities of ozone and carbon monoxide in the air. Also cited by the Federal agency were Baltimore, Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, Milwaukee, San Diego and the Philadelphia-Wilmington, Del., area.
The Clean Air Act requires a 15 percent reduction in carbon monoxide and ozone levels in those areas by 1996 and an additional 3 percent reduction each year through 2007.
 
A Reversible Lane Considered
 In part, New York is looking at tougher automobile inspection and maintenance standards, cleaner fuels and electric-powered vehicles to reduce air pollution. The New York Thruway Authority, which oversees 600 miles of highway in the state, will be testing battery-operated cars along a stretch of roadway near Albany, said John H. Shafer, executive director for the authority.
The Thruway Authority has also proposed rebuilding much of the six-lane Cross Westchester Expressway, adding a seventh reversible lane for high-occupancy vehicles to ease road congestion.
Meanwhile, the state has developed a Metropolitan New York Employee Commute Options Program to reduce rush-hour traffic. Statistics from the Environmental Protection Agency show that transportation sources -- specifically automobiles -- cause 40 to 60 percent of the pollution that produces ozone, which is the main ingredient of urban smog, and 70 to 80 percent of carbon monoxide emissions. Reducing automobile use, however, is expected to have only a minimal impact on air quality, said Francis G. Ronnenberg, executive director of the Westchester Transportation Management Organization, a public-private alliance created four years ago between the county and the Westchester County Association, a business group.
"In fact, fewer cars on the road may have no appreciable effect whatever on cleaning the air, but it will reduce congestion and energy needs, along with the demand for major new road construction, which are all good things," Mr. Ronnenberg said, explaining that most gains will be realized through stricter inspection standards to curb emissions and alternative fuels that burn more cleanly.
 
Possible Loss of Federal Funds
 Mr. Ronnenberg added that commuter traffic represented only part of all traffic on the road, and that trucks and other vehicles would continue to contribute to the pollution problem. He said congressional studies and a report from Texaco indicated that emissions from automobiles would be reduced only 0.2 to 0.5 percent if commuter traffic was minimized.
Under the trip-reduction section of the Clean Air Act, businesses will have to cut by about 25 percent the number of cars traveling to work sites, and car pools and van pools will be encouraged. Estimates show that the average vehicle occupancy in the state is now 1.25 people a vehicle; the law's goal is 1.56 riders a car.
For the region, failure to meet the mandates of the Clean Air Act could result in loss of Federal highway funds and more restrictions on industry.
Late last month, the County Board of Legislators unanimously approved a local law to support the state and Federal efforts, imposing fines on Westchester companies failing to make a "good faith effort" to comply with the Clean Air Act provisions.
All companies affected by the law -- those with 100 or more workers -- must submit a compliance plan to the county by Nov. 15, even though they have until November 1996 to implement it. Failure to submit such a plan could result in fines to a company of 50 cents to $1 a day for each employee.
The new local law also calls for fees to cover the county's costs of administering a trip-reduction program. Companies with 100 to 250 employees will be charged $300 a year; those with more than 1,000 employees will have to pay $2,000. In return, the county will help develop more interconnecting mass transit options with integrated fare systems.
"We are going to try to change people's patterns," said Joseph Petrocelli, the county's Acting Transportation Commissioner. "We will be encouraging new programs, although we expect some resistance because the alternatives are less conventional than getting in your private car, rolling up the window and putting on the stereo for the drive to work."
There will be no penalties on individuals who "want to go it on their own," Mr. Petrocelli said. "It's the responsibility of the employer."
At the White Plains office of Metro Pool Inc., a federally financed nonprofit organization, its president, Carol Dee Angell, said she was encouraging increased use of mass transportation and of centers where buses, trains and shuttle vans connect. In addition, she was recommending that employees who could work at home on a computer (so-called telecommuting) do so on one or more days a week and that other ways of condensing the workweek like four 10-hour days instead of five 8-hour days be considered -- "anything to take cars off the roads at peak hours" to help companies comply with the Federal law.
Metro Pool, which offers ride-sharing information and consulting services to employers, also recommends that companies pay incentives to employees who use mass transportation and that, when appropriate, purchase large vehicles to enable workers to form van pools.
At Nynex in White Plains, Roy Deitchman, a managing director for environmental policy, said he had developed a team to look at the options for complying with the act and was weighing the advantages of compressed workweeks and other measures.
But at Zierick Manufacturing, Ms. Zierick said she supported the law in spirit but was wrestling with the reality of potential costs. "Maybe a Reader's Digest or an I.B.M. can afford to buy a van," she said, "but a company of our size certainly cannot."
Harold E. Vogt, president and chief executive officer of the County Chamber of Commerce, based in White Plains, said the law "looked good on paper but placed too many constraints on individual rights." He said that in a Chamber of Commerce survey of more than 300 employers, respondents overwhelmingly said the law would increase the costs of doing business in Westchester and could force them either to relocate or reduce their work force.
Mr. Vogt also observed that the law was passed in 1989, when the economy was stronger, and that since then the New York region had lost many workers, effectively mitigating some of the traffic and resulting pollution problems that the Clean Air Act was to address.

HEADLINE: Germany's Fragile North Sea Playground

BYLINE: By J. S. MARCUS; J. S. MARCUS lives in Berlin.

 BODY:
SYLT, a roughly beautiful island off Germany's northwest coast, is topographically fragile, and by German standards, emphatically chic. Now whittled down to a distinctive pick-ax shape, Sylt -- Germans pronounce it Zult, which sounds more or less like zoolt -- has spent the better part of the millennium losing its battle with the wind and waves of the North Sea, while in the last few decades becoming a point of pilgrimage for Germany's moneyed classes.
 The island can prompt strong feelings among Germans, some of whom perceive it as a symbol of the country's celebrated post-war wealth, and some of whom see it as a symbol of the evasions they believe that wealth tried to buy. Its reputation as an enclave of the rich, though, probably has more to do with attitude than with real expense. Most of the accommodations are in a medium price range ($46 to $87 a night), and the restaurants, which maintain a standard unusually high for Germany, are often quite reasonable. 
There is, to be sure, a great deal of "see-and-be-seen" on Sylt, in the restaurants, on the beaches, regardless of the season. Displays of this sort, though, tend to be rather national in character, and Americans, in fact, will find an unusual -- and, these days in Europe, an almost unheard of -- kind of solitude: Sylt seems to be virtually unvisited by Americans, indeed by non-German speakers of any kind.
 As it happens, solitude may be more appropriate to the setting, which is the other reason Germans visit the island. About 24 miles long, and, at its narrowest, only 1,800 feet wide, Sylt possesses a superb, northern beauty. Its western coastline is a continuous sandy beach, and much of its eastern coastline is surrounded by gray, seemingly endless sand flats -- all presided over by a range of grand, shifting sand dunes that are among the only examples of their kind left in Europe. Warmed by the Gulf Stream, Sylt contains Germany's northernmost point, and probably its most windswept. This, though, is part of the island's appeal. There are people who come to the island just to breathe: When seasonal storms are blowing out on the North Sea, the air on Sylt is as clean as the air after a hurricane.
 Sylt is part of the Frisian island chain that runs along the coast of Europe from Denmark to the Netherlands. The chain and its nearby lowlands are separated into western, eastern and northern regions, reflecting a history turbulent even by European standards. The Frisians are actually a separate, if disunified, ethnic group. Their numerous dialects (which are closer to English than to Dutch, German or Danish) can vary dramatically, and the three regions -- and, often, islands within those regions -- have developed their own identities.
 Sylt is the largest island in North Friesland, which, politically and culturally, has moved back and forth between Danish and German spheres of influence. These days, the Sylt brand of North Frisian culture, famously idealized in 19th-century German popular fiction, is on the wane. Few of Sylt's 20,000 year-round residents still speak the dialect as a first language, though there has been an almost extravagant attempt to retain local architectural styles. There are villages on Sylt -- villages that, in their way, are like little boomtowns -- where all the houses must be built traditionally, out of red brick, with thatched roofs and unique, snub-nosed eaves.
 People began visiting Sylt in the middle of the 19th century for a Victorian-style "cure," and the island still takes pride in its reputation as a"North Sea spa," using deep-sea water collected off shore. Most of Sylt's towns and villages maintain a Kurhaus (literally "cure house"), where, after a consultation with a "spa doctor," patients are prescribed a regimen of massages, mud packs, salt-water inhalations, and saunas to treat everything from dandruff to thrombosis. The German health-care system encourages preventive and homeopathic medicine, and will pay for an annual visit to a spa, even to one on Sylt.
 Vacationers, who for some time have made up the majority of the island's visitors, are also encouraged to take a cure, and a massage and sauna are a favorite way to spend a rainy afternoon. (Typical prices: full body massage, $24; sauna, $12.) July and August and New Year's Eve are the most fashionable times to visit Sylt, but it is nearly as crowded in some of the off-season months.
 Sylt's only real city is Westerland; there are between 20,000 and 30,000 people in residence at any given time, and nearly every visitor to the island will at some point pass through it. Well-heeled, Westerland has the feel of any prosperous western German town, though its sparkling pedestrian zone is lined with branches of some of the country's swankiest stores. Leysieffer, the elegant confiserie that many people know from its cafe on the Kurfurstendamm in Berlin, has two cafes in Westerland. The town even has one of the few shops in Germany exclusively licensed to sell Meissen porcelain. The city's main attraction, though, is convenience. Sylt's most popular beaches -- including Buhne 16, probably Germany's best-known nude beach -- are within easy reach, and its night life, which is especially popular among Germany's gay community, is pretty much restricted to a few streets off Westerland's pedestrian zone.
 Though technically an island, Sylt has been connected to the mainland by rail since the 1920's, when an embankment was constructed over a seven-mile area of sand flats. But there is no way to drive to Sylt. If you want to take your car, you must wait for a space on the crowded first-come-first-served car train from Niebull in Schleswig-Holstein, or you can rent one locally.
 WHEN people on the island talk about Kampen, a village two miles north of Westerland, they like to mention the expensive cars that line its narrow, well-kept lanes. Kampen, with only a thousand year-round residents, was known before the war as a bohemian retreat for artists and writers but is now thought to be an outpost of what the Germans call "Schickeria." A kind of West German "radical chic," Schickeria is still associated with industrialists of Germany's economic miracle and with journalists like Ulrike Meinhof (who became a terrorist in the 1970's). Kampen has been especially committed to maintaining its nordfriesisch atmosphere, and it is a little surreal, with expensive delicatessens and some of Germany's most fashionable boutiques looking on the outside like houses of North Frisian farmers and fishermen.
 Kampen also has one of the island's -- in fact, one of northern Germany's -- best-known landmarks: the so-called Red Cliff, a shimmering promontory that provides fabulous views of the North Sea and of the island's heather-covered moors.
 Sylt-Ost -- or "eastern" Sylt, the protruberance that seems to form the handle of the ax -- is a rich expanse of green meadow, not unlike the flat North German plain of which the island was once a part. Keitum, a small town of 2,000, and the other villages on the eastern side of the island are quieter and older.
Keitum was the most important town on Sylt until the North Sea resorts began attracting visitors. Its red-brick houses, many of which date back to the 17th and 18th centuries, are surrounded by elm, linden, chestnut and beech trees, and its meadows are covered with wild roses. Often called "the green heart" of the island, Keitum is especially popular with Sylt's natives.
 Eastern Sylt gives way gently to the strange Schleswig-Holstein sand flats -- barely submerged coastal lands that the Germans call Wattenmeer, or "Cotton sea." The sand flats, which, in one form or another, line much of Europe's northwest coast, support a unique collection of plants and animals. Their delicate fusion of land and water proved quite sensitive to commercial development, and, since 1985, much of the German portion of the region has been protected as national parkland.
 On Sylt, the best way to experience the vastness of the sand flats is by bicycle on the bike path that begins just outside Kaitum. Because of the inconvenience of bringing a car, and the general levelness of the terrain, Sylt abounds in bike-rental outlets, many of which will supply a bike for as little as $5 a day.
 The cuisine on Sylt, like its visitors, comes from all over Germany. The finer restaurants -- three of which earned a Michelin star -- often specialize in neue deutsche Kuche, a kind of nouvelle variation on traditional German food. More moderately priced restaurants offer everything from Leberkas (a spicy Bavarian meat loaf) and Lobskaus (a Hamburg curiosity made with herring, beets and potatoes), to Berlin-style Currywurst. Rote Grutze, a rich red berry compote often associated with Sylt, is served often, and the bakeries offer Danish-style Kopenhagener pastry and strong, grainy North German breads.
 Seafood, of course, is the real local specialty. The sand flats around the island are a superb breeding ground for shellfish, and Sylt's oysters are considered among Europe's finest. Fischbrotchen -- a German version of Danish smorgasbord, featuring herring, eel, smoked salmon or a pile of small, briny North Sea shrimp -- are a popular snack, costing as little as four marks and sold just about everywhere. They taste especially good with Frisian beer, which is paler and more bitter than South German beers, and usually served very cold.
 List, Sylt's northernmost town, is rumored to have the island's freshest fish. List's small harbor is often crowded, but maintains a remarkably different atmosphere from Westerland, where the crowds solemnly promenade in the pedestrian zone, or from Kampen, where the groups of people seem like little crowds unto themselves. List's harbor is lined with cheap fish stands and honky-tonk souvenir booths. Tourists come from all over the island to eat and mill around; there are people giddily waiting to take a duty-free cruise to the nearby Danish island of Romo, drinking while they wait.
 When I visited Sylt early last fall, at the end of the high season, the harbor reminded me of a little Oktoberfest, or one of those winter carnivals and summer festivals so popular in Germany. Eating too fast and drinking too much, the crowds lost their seriousness and became garrulous.
 The sand dunes begin just outside List. Some of them have vertical drops of almost 100 feet but, picked up and then redeposited by the wind, can shift as much as 10 feet in any given year; Germans poetically call them Wanderdunen.
 I had read descriptions beforehand, and seen photographs, but was really unprepared for their cold, almost desert-like, beauty. The day I hiked the dunes was clear but especially windy. Scant clusters of heather and beach grass had already faded into their pale fall colors, giving the dunes a mournful cast, as though scattered with dried-flower bouquets.
 There were deep ridges, somewhat more overgrown and windless and therefore relatively easy to scale, followed by whole slopes that had no growth whatsoever; at one point, I practically had to slide down a 120-foot wall of sand while the wind blew the sand back in my face. Views from the top were impressive and unsettling, dramatically revealing the island's tenuousness. Sylt is still disappearing: The wind is blowing the island away, and the tides are dissolving its coastline.
 THERE is always the threat of a storm and accompanying flood, like the ones in 1362 and 1634, still remembered in this part of Europe (people on Sylt talk about them with a kind of nervous awe). Chunks of coastline suddenly disappeared; lowlands became islands, and whole towns were washed out to sea. Perched on top of a dune, my full bodyweight leaning into the wind, I began to think of Sylt's beauty as something deadly, that what had made the island beautiful would eventually destroy it. After a day's hike through the Wanderdunen, the garishness of List -- with its aromas of beer and sauerkraut and fried fish, and, almost incidentally, of the cold North Sea itself; with its blaring Volksmusik and clatter of knives and forks; with its cross section of German society, North and South and, lately, East and West -- was an unpredictable comfort. I had three Fischbrotchen, a few sausages, Rote Grutze with vanilla sauce, a schnapps, and glasses and glasses of beer, but I tried not to let my foot stamp to the Volksmusik.
AN ISLAND POINT OF PILGRIMAGE FOR THE ELEGANT Getting There
 By Train: Westerland is a terminus on Germany's Intercity train network, making travel to and from the island fast and comfortable. There are also frequent local and regional trains, often going through Hamburg or Kiel. One-way, second-class Intercity fares to Westerland: from Berlin: $62, 6 hours and 45 minutes; from Hamburg: $33, 3 hours; from Dusseldorf: $92, 6 hours and 40 minutes.
 By Car: The car train from Niebull on the coast runs on a first-come-first-served basis. Trains run every half-hour in the high season (July and August), and much less frequently in the winter. There is a $38 fee for the car, and the round-trip fare is $10 per passenger.
 By Plane: Eurowings, Germany's largest privately owned airline, runs direct service to Sylt from a few of the country's larger cities. Unrestricted round-trip fares to Sylt: from Berlin, $463; from Frankfurt, $483; from Munich, $604.
Where to Stay
 The more expensive hotels can be booked through American Express (49-30) 238-4102 in Berlin, which has been running a promotion with the island in its German offices (outside Germany, ask for information about Westerland); for less expensive accommodations like pensions, which usually include breakfast, and apartments (Perienwohnungen), which are quite popular on Sylt, it is best to go through the tourist office in the town you would like to stay in. Kurbetrieb Westerland is at 33 Strandstrasse, 25890 Westerland/Sylt, (49-4651) 810; fax, 81234.
 Kurbetrieb Kampen is at 12 Hauptstrasse, 25999 Kampen/Sylt, (49-4651) 46980. For room information: 469833.
 Kurverwaltung Keitum is at 5 Am Tipkenhoog, 25980 Keitum/Sylt.
 Kurverwaltun List is at Listlandstrasse, 25992 List/Sylt, (49-4652) 1014 or 1015. The Badergemeinschaft, 6 Stephanstrasse, 25980 Westerland, (49-4651) 22450; (literally, "bathers society") can provide general information about the island, and it has people who speak English. Open 10 A.M. to noon and 2 P.M. to 4 P.M. The central tourist office Westerland (Fremden-Verkehrs-Zentrale) room information number is (49-4651) 24001, fax: 24060. For off-season packages in Westerland, contact the central tourist office or the Kurbetrieb in Westerland.Perhaps the island's most highly regarded hotel is the Hotel Stadt Hamburg, 2 Strandstrasse, 25980 Westerland, Sylt, Germany, (49-4651) 8580, which is in the center of Westerland and open all year. Its white-washed brick facade and shingled roof recall the style of a Frisian country house.
Where to Eat
 Restaurant Jorg Muller, 25980 Suderstrasse, Westerland, Sylt; (49-4651) 27789. A restaurant owned by one of Germany's best-known and most innovative chefs. It is expensive. Turbot and lobster en brochette with Champagne and lobster butter sauces served with wild rice costs $96 for two including wine.
 Gosch, Friedrichstrasse, corner of Boysenstrasse; (49-46-51) 23745. A medium-priced, informal bistro in Westerland's pedestrian zone operated by the island's gourmet food distributor. Grilled scampi for one costs about $6. Gosch also has a fish stand at the List harbor and a more formal restaurant, also called Gosch, at 15 Hafenstrasse, List, (49-4651) 7478. Prices there are from $12 to $15).

CORRECTION-DATE: July 24, 1994, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
An article on June 5 about the island of Sylt, off northwestern Germany, misspelled two German words and defined one German word incorrectly. In a letter received on June 14, a reader pointed out that Labskaus, not Lobskaus, is the name of a herring dish; apartments are Ferienwohnungen, not Per ienwohnungen, and Wattenmeer means shal low sea, not cotton sea. Efforts to consult thewriter delayed this correction.

HEADLINE: West Should Assist Russian Education

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "In Russian Education, Growing Class Distinction" (news article, May 22): The lament of Yevgeny V. Tkachenko, Russian Education Minister, "education is no longer a priority in our society," is a great understatement. While per capita gross domestic product has fallen roughly 40 percent in the last three years, the percent of G.D.P. spent on education has dropped from 4 percent to 3.5 percent (against 7 percent in 1970). 
 A major overhaul of the education system could deliver immense long-run economic benefits. Literacy, numeracy and scientific knowledge are widespread in Russia, so it is not necessary to build from scratch. But the system was designed primarily to carry out ideological indoctrination and prepare people for work in the Soviet Union's centrally planned economy. It is woefully inappropriate now that it has been transplanted into a budding market economy. We are left with a Russian population bursting with potential but straitjacketed by its anachronistic and underfinanced education system.
A major investment in education reform needs a large financial commitment and a long gestation period. Here, institutions like the World Bank (for which I am doing a study on the subject) and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development can do what the private sector or government aid programs cannot easily do. With their resources and perspective, they could lay crucial groundwork for the entire region's prosperity and stability.

HEADLINE: In Middle-Class Queens, Blacks Pass Whites in Household Income

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS 

 BODY:
Driven by striking gains in the 1980's among working wives and immigrants, the median income of black households in Queens has surpassed that of whites.
A fresh analysis of 1990 census results found that the economic progress by blacks in Queens, New York City's quintessential middle-class borough, was built largely on a traditional foundation of family solidarity. Married couples, whether born here or abroad, typically made the greatest strides, while households headed by individuals generally lagged. 
 The median income for all black households in Queens was $34,300, just above the $34,000 for non-Hispanic whites. For married couples born in this country, the median was $50,000 for black households, or slightly more than the $49,900 reported by white couples born here.
Among immigrant families, so common in Queens, black couples earned a median household income of $48,800, or appreciably more than the $40,500 median reported by whites born abroad.
Blacks had higher household incomes than whites in more than 130 cities and counties in the United States. But unlike Queens, they were mostly localities where the median income was below the national average, on or near military bases or where blacks constitute either a small proportion or an overwhelming share of the population.
Only nine of those communities have, like Queens, racially diverse populations of more than 50,000 people. (Non-Hispanic blacks constituted just over 20 percent of Queens's 1990 population of 1,951,598.)
How did blacks surpass whites in median income? In black households, both husband and wife were more likely to have jobs than in white households, and they worked longer hours, as well. And sons and daughters in black households were more likely to remain at home and help support the family, rather than leave and live on their own.
"It's a function of family structure," Joseph Salvo, director of the city Planning Department's Population Division, said of the differential between blacks in Queens and less well-off blacks elsewhere. "You are, in effect diluting the influence of female-headed households."
Married couples accounted for 4 in 10 of the households headed by American-born blacks in Queens and about half of the households headed by black immigrants, roughly the same proportion as among whites. The median income of American-born blacks lagged behind the median for foreign-born blacks in virtually every type of household other than married couples.
The census analysis, conducted for The New York Times by Dr. Andrew A. Beveridge of Queens College, found that much of the prosperity among blacks in Queens was enjoyed by Caribbean immigrants, many of whom came to the United States with the savings and skills that quickly qualify as middle-class. Many joined relatives who arrived here earlier.
The census analysis suggests that when American-born blacks have stable, traditional families, they do a bit better than immigrants do. But because American blacks are less likely to form such families, blacks born abroad generally fared better than those born here and, for the most part, better than white immigrants.
The latest analysis goes beyond an earlier finding by The Times, which, from preliminary census results, suggested that the median income for black households in Queens virtually matched that of white households. That analysis did not elaborate on the jobs, ages, place of origin, family makeup and other variables that accounted for the gains. Nor did it hint that the income of blacks in some categories had surpassed that of non-Hispanic whites.
 
Queens as Haven Before the Suburbs
 Queens remains pockmarked by poverty, but it has, historically, thrived as a haven for aspiring middle-class refugees from other boroughs -- often as their last stop in the city before moving to the suburbs -- and, more recently, for newcomers from abroad. An infusion of Koreans, Chinese, Indians and other immigrants has revitalized aging neighborhoods in Queens into prosperous middle-class enclaves; so, to some degree, have people transplanted from South America.
The number of non-Hispanic whites in Queens, wealthier ones included, declined during the 1980's. But by distinguishing white Hispanic people from other whites, the more recent analysis dispels the suspicion that the statistical parity in incomes between blacks and whites was simply a consequence, in good part, of poorer Hispanic immigrants depressing the median among whites generally.
"It's pretty striking," said Richard P. Nathan, provost of the Rockefeller Institute of Government at the State University of New York at Albany.
"This is the untold story of the cities," he said. "If you look at all the blacks in metropolitan areas of the United States, 24 percent live in extreme poverty areas, where 40 percent or more of the people are poor. But the flip side is, 76 percent don't. And even the 24 percent who live in extreme poverty areas are not all poor."
"It's the flip side of the underclass," Dr. Nathan said.
Black household income approached or exceeded the median reported by whites in a range of smaller and mostly suburban places in the region. They include Mount Vernon in Westchester County; Uniondale, Elmont and Westbury in Nassau County, Brentwood in Suffolk County, and Linden and South Orange in New Jersey.
(The Census Bureau defines a household as all people living in an apartment or a house, including families, people living alone, two or more families living together and any unrelated individuals living with them. The median is the point at which half the incomes are greater and half are less.)
 
Middle-Class Blacks: Expanding Number
 Dr. Salvo of the city Planning Department said he was so stunned by Dr. Beveridge's findings about Queens that he conducted his own analysis of 200,000 married couples in the borough. Dr. Salvo's findings were even more pronounced: In the households of white married couples, median income was $47,500; among comparable blacks, it was $49,300.
"Statisticians might argue that both figures really represent a range of several thousand dollars," Dr. Salvo said, "but it is amazing that they're even close."
Among married-couple families, twice as many blacks as whites had three or more workers; twice as many white as black married-couple families were headed by a person older than 65. Still, Dr. Salvo said, even among couples between the ages of 25 and 44, earnings were about the same regardless of race.
Focusing on two overwhelmingly black census tracts in Laurelton that are home to about 4,000 people, Dr. Beveridge found that between 1980 and 1990, the proportion of adults in the civilian work force climbed from two-thirds to three-quarters. The proportion of college graduates among people 25 and older rose from 30 percent to 52 percent, the share of people living below the poverty level had plunged from 13 percent to 3 percent and the average family income had more than doubled.
"No one could argue that this is not the picture of a middle-class community," Dr. Beveridge said.
Michael Owens, a 24-year-old doctoral student who works for the Rockefeller Institute, typifies the emerging second-generation of the black middle class.
"If you were to start in Hollis and head south through Cambria Heights, Laurelton and Rosedale there's a spine of affluence," said Mr. Owens, who grew up in South Jamaica, Queens, and plans to return to the borough after graduation.
His father was from Saint Kitts-Nevis in the Caribbean. His mother, a nurse, was from Virginia, where she has retired. Still in Queens are an uncle, a retired bus driver; and two aunts, one a teacher and the other an administrator with the city Social Services Department.
 
For Immigrants, A Base of Skills
 April Green and her husband, Anthony, live in a private house in St. Albans, not far from the nail salon they own on Linden Boulevard. Ms. Green, 34, is a lawyer and practices in an office across the street from the salon. Mr. Green, 38, is a plate-maker for a printing company in Manhattan. Together, they earn more than $75,000.
"Quite a few of the businesses on Linden and Merrick Boulevards are owned by African-Americans or Caribbeans," Ms. Green said, describing herself as emblematic of an expanding black middle class.
"My cousin is a vice president at Chase Manhattan and her mother is a school librarian," Ms. Green said. "My cousin's husband is a Ph.D. in molecular biology. I have a friend working on her Ph.D. and her husband is a real-estate broker. A woman who worked in my salon has opened her own salon and her mother is an accountant."
Dr. Barbara W. Emerson, dean of the Search for Education Elevation and Knowledge program at Queens College, said, "Queens is where blacks move from Brooklyn and from other parts of the city."
"Whereas whites who can afford to would move farther out on Long Island, blacks with income to move and buy a house can afford Queens better," said Dr. Emerson, a single parent, who is black and who lives with her son, Weusi, a college senior, in St. Albans.
"When my son graduates from college, he will probably stay at home," she said. "The houses here are single family, often containing extended families, and the income for the household is high because several working adults are pooling their resources."
"I have seen a change in terms of the number of immigrants, particularly from the Caribbean, who came here with an economic base to build on," Dr. Emerson said. "They're often skilled in areas where they can get good employment, like nursing."
 
Still, Race Remains Barrier to Integration
 For many blacks, finding satisfactory housing remains a challenge, she and others said, because of the high cost and of enduring racial segregation. Particularly among blacks, studies have found, race remains a greater barrier to integration than class.
An earlier census analysis by Dr. Beveridge found that poor blacks and rich blacks in New York City are segregated from whites at about the same level. Among households with a family income of $100,000 or more, he found, 9 in 10 blacks would have to move to be integrated with non-Hispanic whites of comparable income.
"Part of it is an artifact of segregation," Dr. Beveridge said. "They can move to Mount Vernon, the northern Bronx, Laurelton, St. Albans and, increasingly, to Canarsie, but they're not able to go to Levittown, Eastchester, places that are good but not great places to move."
During the 1980's, the non-Hispanic white population of Queens declined by about 230,000; the black population rose by about 50,000. Median household income rose for both groups, though -- by 31 percent for black households in Queens and by 19 percent for white households.
Compared to whites, black couples were more likely to consist of two wage earners. Their income was more likely to be supplemented by their children's earnings. Nine in 10 blacks said their income came from wages, compared to 3 in 4 whites, who were more likely to have retirement, Social Security and investment income.
Black wives typically worked longer hours and, consequently, earned more than their white counterparts. About the same proportions of black women and white women held professional specialty, executive, administrative and management jobs. Relatively few black men held these sorts of jobs.
"The success of the civil rights revolution has had its effect particularly in the public sector," Dr. Nathan said, referring to the large proportion of blacks who work for the government, for hospitals and in education -- the same gateway to the economic mainstream that many other groups entered.

HEADLINE: Ahead for Health Proposal: Subtle Art of Compromise

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, June 5

 BODY:
The technocratic era of the health care struggle is long over, with the White House policy purists consigned to the sidelines. It is June, time is running short for passing a bill, and some major Congressional committees have been stymied for months over one central issue: whether to require employers to contribute to the cost of their workers' insurance.
For the lawmakers in the middle, it is time for some serious dealing, time to look for some political fixes and some political cover and time to find a way to finesse the chasm between those who have proudly and angrily opposed those "employer mandates" and those who have just as proudly and angrily supported them. It is the moment, in short, when politicians like Senator John B. Breaux of Louisiana, a conservative Democrat who is a member of the Senate Finance Committee, a quintessential swing vote who loves to deal, become very, very important. 
 "If we all stick to what we initially proposed, we'll all go off the cliff together," Mr. Breaux said this weekend, as he traveled from a rural electrical cooperative conference in sweltering Lafayette to a convention of retailers in slightly less sweltering New Orleans. "This thing is not going to be solved from the left or the right, but from the center."
Heading into a hard-eyed crowd of retailers, Mr. Breaux laughingly gave what may be the credo for members of the House and Senate in this dangerous season: "I'm going to do anything that gets me out alive."
Indeed, visits to four states over the Memorial Day recess, which ends on Tuesday, underscore the political risks for those who hope to win passage of major health legislation this year -- and thus their need for some kind of face-saving compromise, fast.
They face increasingly emboldened Republicans, like Representative James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin, who said that he flatly told his constituents that the nation could not afford universal health coverage and that he had no fear of political fallout from voting against such coverage.
They face increasingly energized interest groups, like the small-business owners in Philadelphia who grilled Erskine Bowles, the head of the Small Business Administration, about the workings of President Clinton's health plan last week. They face television and radio commercials in opposition to the various elements of restructuring health care and six months of second thoughts about the need for change.
"They've become more cautious," was how Senator Kent Conrad of North Dakota, another Democrat on the Finance Committee, described his constituents after a week of public forums on health care. "For all of us, there's a growing understanding of how really complicated this is."
Adding to the political anxiety is the approach of the mid-term elections, the turmoil around Representative Dan Rostenkowski's indictment and the recognition that unless the major committees -- perhaps most notably, the Senate Finance Committee, with its narrow 11-to-9 Democratic majority -- move a bill this month, the chances of completing it this year are slim.
 
'A Huge Improvement'
 All of this heightens the urgency of doing something. To the health planning purists who say this is no way to make policy, Mr. Breaux breezily replies, "It may not be, but not passing the bill is not doing it either.
"If we consider ourselves at ground level zero right now, and the President has proposed a 10, Congress is not going to pass a 10," the Louisiana Democrat added. "But I think we could do a 7 or an 8, and that would be a huge improvement over the current situation."
Mr. Breaux is a co-sponsor, with Representative Jim Cooper of Tennessee, of a rival to Mr. Clinton's health plan that avoids a requirement for employers to pay for insurance mandate or the promise of universal coverage, but with a vow to make insurance more affordable and accessible through changes in the marketplace.
Mr. Breaux began floating compromises on employer payments last month, looking for ways to bridge the gap between the no-mandate and the pro-mandate forces.
 
Intricate Compromise
 His latest compromise is inelegantly known as a hard trigger. From a political standpoint, it seeks to answer the argument of more conservative lawmakers that changes in health insurance -- like voluntary insurance purchasing pools for businesses and individuals -- ought to be given a chance to work before the Government steps in with new requirements for business.
Under the Breaux compromise, a mandate would be imposed only if large percentages of people remained without insurance three to five years after the law went into effect. Goals would be set for businesses based on size: for example, among companies with 100 or more employees, 85 percent of those workers now uninsured would have to be covered within three years or the mandate would automatically kick in. The very smallest businesses, with 10 or fewer workers, are exempt from any requirement.
This proposal is still very much in the floating stage, and a White House spokeswoman says that officials cannot comment on one element of a plan without seeing the entire proposal. But the idea of triggers has, at the moment, considerable political appeal, particularly for a senator like Mr. Conrad, from a rural state populated by small businesses.
"This is a state of shopkeepers," Mr. Conrad said on Friday. "People say, let the market work. Let's have the insurance market reforms. Let's have the purchasing cooperatives available, and the discounted premiums for small businesses, and see. And if it will work, you'll never have to have to go to it."
No one knows, of course, whether the trigger compromise will work politically; several such compromises have been floated in recent weeks in other committees, and no great breakthrough has yet occurred. In the Senate, one of the major unknowns is what it will take for a critical mass of Republicans to break ranks and back a bipartisan bill. Another is how flexible the White House will be in interpreting the President's demand for a bill that provides universal coverage.
If they can resolve the question of mandates, many lawmakers say they are confident the rest of the bill will quickly fall into shape. But others fear that Congress will realize only then how difficult other aspects will be, particularly curbing costs.
In the meantime, the expectation in the districts and states that something will happen on health care this year remains high. That, in the end, may be the most powerful spur for a compromise. Matt Schwarz, a Bismarck resident told Mr. Conrad at a forum of his struggles to care for a severely disabled daughter and make his way through a mine field of insurance company rules. "Health care reform has been the butt of jokes for some, but for some of us it is no laughing matter," Mr. Schwarz said.
Mr. Conrad also heard from the local leader of the National Federation of Independent Business, warning of vast job losses from mandates. "Our concern is not so much the uninsured as the unemployed," said Marsha Lembke, a small-business owner who is the state director of the federation.
The clash of all these competing needs and fears will only intensify as the health care debate moves toward a bill or a stillbirth.

HEADLINE: U.S.-MEXICO TRADE ADVANCES SHARPLY UNDER NEW ACCORD

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: DALLAS, June 5

 BODY:
In the first three months after a new trade agreement took effect, trade between Mexico and the United States rose sharply to record levels.
Imports from Mexico grew much more rapidly than United States exports, cutting the American trade surplus with Mexico for the first quarter nearly in half. The numbers are the first to measure the impact of the North American Free Trade Agreement since it took effect Jan. 1. 
 The trade imbalance between the two countries has sharpened antagonism between organized labor, which opposed the trade agreement because it feared the loss of American jobs, and leaders in business and Government, who said the pact would create jobs by making Mexico a huge market for American goods.
United States exports to Mexico rose 15.7 percent, to a record $11.85 billion, seasonally adjusted, in the first quarter compared with the comparable quarter a year earlier, according to the Commerce Department. Imports from Mexico rose 22.5 percent, to a record $11.29 billion. That narrowed the nation's quarterly trade surplus with Mexico by 45.1 percent, to $560 million.
Both sides agree that a single quarter is not enough time to determine a long-term trend and that it is difficult to distinguish the effects of the trade pact from other causes of steadily increasing commerce between the two nations. Indeed, many shipments in the first quarter reflected plans made before the trade agreement was approved in November.
Nevertheless, Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, said in an interview on Friday that the agreement was already fulfilling the Administration's promises to create jobs. "Nafta has increased trade substantially," he said. "The balance of trade is not as important as the content of trade and the increase in exports. That's what raises our standard of living."
Some economists and trade experts had expected goods to flow more strongly toward Mexico than toward the United States because trade barriers, which have been much higher in Mexico, were falling rapidly. A strong peso also favored Mexican purchasers because it made goods imported from the United States more affordable.
But United States exports have been hurt by the persistent recession in Mexico even as the United States economy has grown strongly. Another drag on trade, according to economists, is the complexity of the new pact. Some manufacturers are still figuring out how it applies to their products.
Labor leaders, although cautious about reaching conclusions so soon, saw evidence that the trade pact was increasing Mexican exports more than imports, at the potential cost of jobs in the United States.
"Mickey Kantor always used to say that Nafta will create 200,000 new jobs by 1995," said Mark A. Anderson, director of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s task force on trade. "But that was based on an increasing U.S. trade surplus, and our surplus has declined." Mexico, he said, remained a minor market for United States goods but a major source of cheap labor for United States companies.
Mr. Kantor said he saw no relation between the trade balance and jobs, adding that an improving Mexican economy and growing middle class would increase demand for United States products.
In the first quarter, the largest increase in imports came in motor vehicles, up 48.3 percent, to $728 million, from the first quarter of 1993. Among the largest increases in United States exports were electrical and mechanical equipment for industry, raw materials and motor vehicle parts.
Much of the increased trade appeared to reflect closer teamwork between factories across a fading border, with the United States often sending parts and materials to Mexico for final assembly.
 
Imports From Mexico Surge
 United States trade officials say that imports from Mexico are growing twice as fast as imports from the rest of the world, and American exports to Mexico three times as fast.
"We've really seen the difference with Nafta," said Regina K. Vargo, director of the Commerce Department's Mexico office. "Especially given the relatively flat economy in Mexico."
Quick judgments about the flow of jobs, however, are difficult. Many economists say both nations are likely to gain jobs from increased trade, which would benefit consumers as well.
"The jobs hurt by trade are found in other industries that are expanded through trade," said David M. Gould, a senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.
Checks with several corporations that campaigned for the passage of the trade agreement in November brought some reports of increased exports and added jobs. Allied Signal Inc., whose chief executive, Lawrence A. Bossidy, led USA Nafta, a business lobbying group, said shipments of Autolite spark plugs to Mexico would reach 20 million this year, up from 12 million last year.
For the company's plant in Fostoria, Ohio, "that's a whole month's production," helping to make the 1,000 jobs there more stable, if not adding to them, said Paul A. Boudreau, Allied Signal's director of government relations.
 
 
Lower Tariffs
 Under the trade pact, Mexico reduced its tariff on spark plugs to 12 percent this year from 15 percent as the first step toward elimination of the tariff by 1998. The company, however, said stronger marketing and a contract to supply the Mexican operations of the Ford Motor Company had also contributed to its substantial gains.
Texas Instruments Inc. said it was selling three times as many computer printers in Mexico after the removal of a 20 percent tariff, and 10 times as many laptop computers, after a tariff was reduced to 16 percent from 20 percent. But Robert L. Price, a company spokesman, said a stronger sales effort in Mexico had likewise contributed to these advances.
USA Nafta recently published a 15-page list of current and potential export gains, including examples from all three auto makers. General Motors, the report said, had moved enough Chevrolet Cavalier production to Lansing, Mich., from Mexico to create 800 to 1,000 jobs
G.M. and industry analysts said that the company's quarterly exports to Mexico had risen to more than 11,000 cars and trucks in just the first quarter of 1994 from 1,700 last year. About 8,500 of the cars sent to Mexico, however, were made in Spain, with 1,906 cars and 605 trucks from Canada and the United States.
John F. Smith Jr., the chief executive of G.M., said earlier this year that he expected exports from the United States and Canada to Mexico to reach 15,000 cars and trucks this year.
The auto industry's sharp cutbacks in the United States and heavy imports from Mexico placed it at the center of last year's trade debate. Last year, G.M. sent 89,000 vehicles from Mexico to the United States.
But Mr. Smith noted that most of the G.M. cars built in Mexico, including those for the domestic market, consist largely of parts from the United States. "As sales increase in Mexico, production in Mexico will support more jobs in the U.S.," he said.
Some labor leaders, however, say the failure of exports to rise as rapidly as imports is all the more striking because Mexico has been much more protective. "The reduction of barriers all of a sudden produced a market there," said Arthur Gundersheim, director of in international affairs at the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union. "Our markets were already open." As far as the trade agreement's effect on United States exports is concerned, he said, "The story is that it hasn't done more."

As Francis Jock, a Mohawk fisherman and environmental researcher, sped away from the bank in a small boat to check his nets, he listed other indicators of the river's improving condition. "The eagles and the hawks have come back," said Mr. Jock, who has spent all of his 52 years along the river's edge. "I see mink and otter again. And the fish -- they are plentiful, like when I was a child." 
 Here at the northernmost tip of New York, where the St. Lawrence River forms the boundaries of three nations -- the United States, Canada and the 28,000-acre Akwesasne Mohawk nation -- the costliest and most extensive toxic waste cleanup undertaken in the United States by private companies is beginning. The scientific and administrative lessons learned here are likely to be applied to similarly complex contamination problems in the Hudson River, the Great Lakes, San Francisco Bay, the Chesapeake Bay and the San Pedro Channel off Los Angeles, the Environmental Protection Agency said.
 
Zeroing In on a Pollutant
 The decontaminating of this busy stretch of the St. Lawrence River, which could eventually cost $500 million, is beginning to yield promising results because of several factors. The first is that PCB's, the contaminant of most concern, were banned in 1978, effectively shutting off the largest source of pollution in the river.
A second decisive action was passage of the Federal Superfund law in 1980 and an equivalent law in 1982 in New York State, which gave government regulators broad authority to compel the biggest polluters, three aluminum manufacturing plants, to pay for the PCB cleanup. PCB's, or polychlorinated biphenyls, are compounds that were used in many industrial products and processes, like the manufacture of inks and the insulation of electrical equipment.
A third factor was a decision by the tribe, the state and the Federal Government to concentrate on cleaning up a single chemical offender -- PCB's -- and not to spend years removing every pollutant. "If we had to investigate and remove every contaminant we found along a stretch of river, then we would have gotten into a situation where we would have spent decades defining the problem and done nothing to address it," said Lisa Carson, who since 1990 has managed the cleanup for the E.P.A.
The fourth decision was to leave some mildly contaminated sediments in the river instead of stirring them up with dredges.
But even as the St. Lawrence is one of the rare success stories in clearing a region of nasty wastes, almost nobody connected with the project is satisfied. State and Federal officials say PCB's are only part of the St. Lawrence's ecological problems.
Industrial executives complain that state and Federal cleanup rules are making them waste a lot of money that might be better spent on other environmental risks in the area.
Among the 9,000 Mohawks who live on the banks of the St. Lawrence, pollution has produced a wearying despair. "This stuff got into everything connected with this river," Mr. Jock said recently over the whine of his outboard engine. "It's been there a generation already. It's going to take a generation, maybe two, maybe three generations to get out. What will this do to the fish, to the animals? What will this do to our children? No matter how much money is spent, nobody has those answers."
 
Physical and Spiritual Source
 For nearly three centuries, Mohawks have lived on the St. Lawrence's high bluffs 80 miles down river from its source, Lake Ontario. Until the last three decades, the river had provided a bounty of fish and pelts. It is also a central symbol of Mohawk culture and religious life. According to the tribe's creation legend, otter, mink, beaver and muskrat helped establish the world on the shell of a snapping turtle.
In the 1960's, Mr. Jock and other Mohawk fishermen began to find that most of the catfish, carp and trout in their nets were marked by open sores. Some other species of fish they caught were twisted into hideous shapes. Otter and mink, they said, had vanished.
In the late 1970's, scientists from Cornell University who were looking into environmental problems in the region, told the state and the tribe that one cause of the deformities might be the PCB's. The authorities from New York State and the Federal Government investigated and confirmed that PCB's, through the food chain, had infiltrated the tissues of nearly every living creature in the region. Doctors even found elevated levels of PCB's in the breast milk of nursing Mohawks.
The source of the contamination was traced to the three aluminum manufacturing plants, owned by General Motors, Reynolds Metals and the Aluminum Company of America. All three companies had used PCB's to insulate and operate metal-making equipment because they are heat-resistant and nearly indestructible.
But the companies, like hundreds of other manufacturers around the country, disposed of thousands of pounds of PCB's in the nearest river -- in this case the St. Lawrence and several of its tributaries. Barrels of PCB-contaminated waste were also placed in poorly constructed pits and the chemical seeped into the river.
 
Early Federal Cleanup Site
 In 1983, the General Motors plant became one of the first sites in the country designated for cleanup under the Federal Superfund law, which had been passed three years earlier. In the following years, New York and the Federal Government split the responsibility for overseeing the cleaning of wastes from the two other plants, with the state managing the waste dumped on land and the E.P.A. managing the cleanup of PCB's contaminating the river's sediments.
Pressed by the tribe, the state and General Motors also took responsibility for protecting the health of the Mohawks and other people who fished in the river.
In the late 1980's, General Motors financed a study by the New York Department of Health to determine the level of PCB's in the breast milk of 97 nursing Mohawks. GM sponsored the study after other laboratory studies clearly showed that PCB's caused cancer in rodents and appeared to be related to an array of other effects in animals, including neurological disorders and growth abnormalities. Because of that, New York has been warning people for over a decade not to eat fish caught in the river.
The latest results indicate that people are heeding the warning not to eat fish from PCB-contaminated waters. According to Dr. Edward Fitzgerald, a state physician, a recent study showed that the levels of PCB's in the breast milk of nursing Mohawk mothers were the same or even lower than the PCB levels in a group of women from the region who rarely if ever ate fish from the river.
The study has been expanded to include the children and the male relatives of the women. Dr. Kelley Brix, a state researcher, said in an interview that the adults and the children exhibited no signs of having been affected by contamination from PCB's or other chlorinated chemicals detected in the region.
Whether exposure to PCB's from eating fish is a substantial hazard to people is a subject of fierce scientific disagreement. Most studies of human health, looking at factory workers exposed to significantly higher levels of the compounds, have not detected any strong association with unusual numbers of cancers. The Federal Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry in Atlanta is studying Indians, members of minorities and anglers in the Great Lakes region exposed to PCB-contaminated fish to determine whether the chemical can cause subtler health problems, like low birth weights, liver abnormalities and learning disorders.
 
Upsetting a Way of Life
 But such results have provided scant comfort to Mohawks, about 9,000 of whom now live on both sides of the St. Lawrence. Perhaps nowhere else in the United States has a community's culture -- from its diet to how families earn their livings -- been so disrupted by pollution.
PCB contamination essentially put the river off limits to all but occasional recreational fishing and hunting. Almost overnight, commercial fishing and guiding, once one of the tribe's most vibrant cottage industries, was destroyed. Many families turned to smuggling liquor, cigarettes and drugs across the river to Canada, tribal officials said.
Mohawk families that used to eat fish almost daily do so rarely now. Even community fish fries use store-bought fish. "Nobody eats fish anymore," said Gale Rourke, the second oldest of 10 children who said her family used to eat fish almost every night. "Now, maybe we have one dinner of fish a year."
Red meat and fast food have become mainstays of the Mohawk diet and contribute to the tribe's high rates of heart disease, obesity, diabetes and cynicism, said Dr. Benson Kelly, the Mohawk medical director.
Kenneth L. Jock, the Mohawk environmental director, said tribal leaders were unsure whether such changes in the reservation's economy and culture will ever be reversed, even if the river becomes clean enough to support a fishing and guiding industry again. "Everything has changed so quickly," Mr. Jock said. "The cost to our traditions has been very high. Our children think fish come from the supermarket instead of their father's net."

HEADLINE: Resolving a Crisis: Can Haiti Emulate South Africa?

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, June 5

 BODY:
They have both been governed for generations by rigid caste systems, South Africa's based solely on race, Haiti's driven by both money and skin color. Both countries have long been riven by political violence. And both have been the objects of strong international pressure for change.
But since Nelson Mandela rose to the presidency of South Africa, successfully negotiating a democratic end to the system of apartheid that choked his nation, Haitians have been watching, some envious and many fearful, wondering if this is where the similarities between their two countries end. 
 With the United States now openly pondering military action to return Haiti's elected President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, to office, speculation among Haitians is rife over whether their country, which is perhaps as divided along class and political lines as any in the world, can muster the maturity and cohesiveness to forge a working democracy.
 
Drawing the Parallels
 No one has been more conscious of the comparisons with South Africa than Father Aristide himself. During an interview last week that lasted nearly two hours, almost every subject the exiled Father Aristide touched on brought him back to the example of Mr. Mandela and South Africa.
"President Mandela is the incarnation of the capacity to move toward reconciliation," said Father Aristide, who last month attended the inauguration of Mr. Mandela, who replaced F. W. de Klerk as President of South Africa. "But when I saw former President de Klerk, I congratulated him too, and said 'I wish we could find someone in Haiti to act the way you have.' "
But if some in Haiti's tiny elite are cheered by Father Aristide's pronouncements -- which these days are often peppered with words like "reconciliation" and calls for respect for the law -- it is clear that most of them are not. Many Haitians say that a lasting settlement of this country's long-running political crisis will be difficult to achieve, whether through intervention or negotiation, precisely because of the differences between Haiti and South Africa.
Father Aristide, many say, lacks both the organizational support and the reassuring wisdom of Mr. Mandela, both of which would be helpful in calming fears and striking workable compromises.
And Haiti's elite, long accustomed to monopolizing the country's tiny economic pie, has never learned the benefits of sacrifice or the meaning of the greater good.
"When we look at our society we find that we are lacking at both ends," said Jean-Claude Desgranges, a politically active Haitian physician.
"It is not just that Aristide does not have the maturity of Mandela, but Aristide is surrounded by a folkloric movement, Lavalas, that is poorly structured," he said, referring to the grass roots political movement whose most unifying element is Father Aristide's personal charisma.
"On the other side," he continued. "we have an archaic and mercantile bourgeoisie that has never understood the stakes for our country or the need to have a new social pact."
 
A Bad Mix
 For Haiti, many fear, the combination of the two -- a priest-president who before his overthrow in September 1991 seemed to relish the language of class warfare, and an elite that has never been willing to pay taxes or establish even minimal social services for the poor -- still seems highly explosive.
Father Aristide's standing with the Haitian masses is, if anything, as hallowed as that of Mr. Mandela. But while the South African leader has earned the grudging respect, if not love, of many in his country's white minority, for those who live a life of wealth and ease in this hemisphere's most wretched country, Father Aristide's name still conjures images of chaos and revenge.
International human rights experts say that this is largely undeserved. If the Haitian President has a long history of incendiary language, and often made provocative statements during his nearly eight months in office, human rights abuses and political violence both declined during his tenure. Since his overthrow, meanwhile, Haiti has been the scene of repeated and unpunished killings by army-sponsored thugs.
 
Few Friends Come Forward
 Still, Father Aristide's efforts at reconciliation have been seen by many here as half-hearted, at best. From the middle class, which feeds at the trough of a corrupt government, to the cream of the elite, which pulls almost all the economic strings here, fear and hatred of the exiled leader runs deep.
One of the surest signs of this is the fact that many of the paramilitary militias that have formed here in recent months are peopled not only by the easy-to-hire poor, but by the sons of the wealthy, for whom obtaining automatic weapons has become as standard as stocking up on gasoline to beat an international embargo.
"If it is true that Aristide is no Mandela, it is unfortunately true that there are no de Klerks here too," said one Haitian businessman who is one of the rare members of the elite to support Father Aristide's return. "Among my peers there is no vision. The people are driven either by fear or opportunism, and when it comes to political solutions, they will welcome anything but Aristide, even our destruction."

HEADLINE: Inflation Is Viewed As Stable

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 5

 BODY:
Top officials at the nation's central bank have concluded that growth in the American economy has slackened slightly and that inflation is under control, making further interest rate increases much less likely in the coming weeks.
Three of the Federal Reserve Board's five governors said they did not believe that unemployment had dropped to an alarming extent, given contradictory information on hiring that the Labor Department released on Friday along with an announcement that unemployment had fallen to 6 percent in May from 6.4 percent in April. 
 The Federal Reserve has already raised short-term interest rates by a total of 1.25 percentage points in four stages in the last four months. As a result, the interest rates that Americans pay on their mortgages, credit cards and small-business loans have climbed.
The Federal Reserve has long regarded steep drops in unemployment as one of the two or three clearest signals of an overheating economy and future inflation if the drops come when unemployment is already low.
 
 
The Economic Panorama
 In separate interviews on other topics on Friday and Saturday, the three governors said they regarded the fall in the unemployment rate in the context of other recent announcements -- like a slight fall in consumer spending and slowing sales of new cars -- and in light of other employment information released on Friday that suggested the fall in the unemployment rate might not be reliable. "We actually had a mixed week in terms of statistics -- I don't think anyone is alarmed," said Lawrence B. Lindsey, one of the governors.
The overall pattern of recent economic indicators clearly points to a slowing of economic growth and reduced risk of inflation, said Edward W. Kelley Jr., another Fed governor. "Recent data do seem to imply that is what is going on now -- it does not surprise me and does not disturb me," he said.
John P. LaWare, the third governor, noted that personal consumption spending and new factory orders have ebbed slightly and the leading economic indicators are unchanged. "They don't look like runaways to me," he said.
Such sentiments make it much less likely that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates, though this can never be absolutely certain, particularly if economic indicators in coming weeks show unexpected strength.
 
An Eye on Wages
 Mr. LaWare was more cautious than Mr. Lindsey and Mr. Kelley, warning that he would be watching these indicators closely and would be particularly attentive to any sign that wages were beginning to rise quickly enough to feed inflation.
"I don't have any real feel for what this second quarter is going to look like," Mr. LaWare said.
The Federal Reserve might also raise rates if Alan Greenspan, its chairman and most influential voice on monetary policy, decides that the fall in unemployment is worrisome. But a hallmark of Mr. Greenspan's tenure at the central bank has been his reluctance to respond to any single economic indicator, especially if it is inconsistent with other indicators.
Joseph R. Coyne, the Federal Reserve's press secretary, said on Friday that Mr. Greenspan would not comment on the unemployment figures or the economy. But he is understood to share the view that prospects for inflation are less ominous than they appeared earlier this spring.
Clinton Administration officials have a policy of not commenting on the Federal Reserve or short-term interest rates, but are likely to welcome the cautious words of the central bank's top officials. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen has said that he urged Mr. Greenspan on May 15 to signal that interest rates would stop rising after the next increase.
The Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates by half a percentage point two days later while issuing a statement indicating that it had "substantially" finished its current round of rate increases. But the statement also included a sentence hinting that the Fed might move again if it thought subsequent economic indicators required a response from the central bank.
The rough consensus has been that the Federal Reserve would not raise interest rates again soon. But some economists, like David C. Munro at High Frequency Economics, a New York consulting company, have predicted that the Fed would increase rates as soon as last Friday or in the next few days.
Two Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee, Senator Paul S. Sarbanes of Maryland and Senator Jim Sasser of Virginia, have strongly criticized the Federal Reserve for being too quick to think that the economy is in danger of overheating. They have warned that the higher interest rates might needlessly choke off economic growth.
None of the governors interviewed expressed concern that a current leveling off or slight slowing in economic growth might turn into another recession. They also contended that the last four interest rate increases were appropriate, particularly given the fall in the unemployment rate.
"I think that the 6 percent is proof that we probably did the right thing to raise rates earlier this year," Mr. Lindsey said. "I'm sure glad we did it."
 
Looking at Long-Term Rates
 Five presidents of Federal Reserve regional banks join the five governors in voting on interest-rate policy at meetings roughly once every eight weeks, and their views are less clear on whether economic growth is leveling off. In general, the regional bank presidents have tended this spring to pay more attention to long-term interest rates as a sign of whether the Federal Reserve is doing a good job fighting inflation.
Expectations of future inflation tend to push up long-term interest rates. Investors become less willing to lend money for long periods when they fear that inflation will erode the value of the money they are eventually repaid.
Though long-term interest rates remain well above last winter's levels, they have fallen by a third of a percentage point from their peak three weeks ago, suggesting that the regional Fed presidents may be a little less worried than before.
Mr. Kelley and Mr. Lindsey both have reputations within the Federal Reserve as ranking members most willing to raise interest rates early to forestall inflation. Mr. LaWare, the Federal Reserve's top expert on banking issues, has a reputation as a centrist.
 
Gauging 'Natural' Unemployment
 Federal Reserve officials have traditionally worried when unemployment falls very low because this could signal that employers would be forced to start offering higher wages to attract workers. This, in turn, could feed inflation.
Economists at the Federal Reserve and elsewhere have long assumed that a certain percentage of the nation's working-age adults will always be unemployed because they are in the process of changing jobs or have no skills that are sought. No one agrees on this percentage, which is known as the natural rate of unemployment, but the assumption has been that inflation would begin to rise if the unemployment rate dropped through this level.
Stuart E. Weiner, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Mo., attracted attention when he estimated the natural rate to be 6.75 percent in a Viewpoints article in the Business section of The New York Times on May 29. Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the head of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, estimated two weeks ago that the natural rate was between 5.9 and 6.3 percent.
Mr. Kelley, Mr. LaWare and Mr. Lindsey all said that they thought Mr. Weiner had picked too high a figure. Mr. Lindsey said he estimated an unemployment rate of 6.4 percent was neutral with respect to inflation but that even 6 percent might not be a problem.
"It's not like it's a toggle switch," setting off inflation as soon as unemployment falls below the natural rate, he said.
Mr. Kelley agreed. The American labor force is increasingly segmented, with some skills in short supply while others are not. As a result, he said, the overall unemployment rate is not very informative.
"The best approach may be to think of labor capacity utilization as a range of values with inflationary pressures that begin modestly at some point and then intensify progressively as unemployment shrinks," Mr. Kelley said.
Mr. LaWare expressed concern that past estimates of inflation-causing levels of unemployment may no longer be valid because the Labor Department has revised the questions that it asks in surveys to determine how many people do not have jobs and wish they did.
"They've been playing around with this unemployment number anyway," Mr. LaWare said, "so it's hard to pin it down."

HEADLINE: North Korea's Motives Baffle U.S. and the South

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TOKYO, June 5

 BODY:
For America's allies in Asia, the imagery is a bit eerie. As President Clinton observes the 50th anniversary of D-Day, leaders across the Pacific are struggling once again to understand the motives of an 82-year-old dictator who seems to have stepped out of the grainy newsreels of another conflict and may be lurching toward a last, desperate confrontation with his old enemies.
Few believe that North Korea's President, Kim Il Sung, will deliberately reopen the Korean War 41 years after it ended. Far too much has changed since his invasion of South Korea took Seoul and the Truman Administration by complete surprise, and this time, Mr. Kim knows, China and Russia would not come to his aid. 
 But few predicted that Mr. Kim would carry his defiance of the United Nations over inspection of North Korea's nuclear complex this far. And the events of the last few days have cast doubt on the central assumption in dealing with North Korea: that the North's xenophobic leaders, desperate to prop up a sinking economy and to preserve their authoritarian Government, are willing to trade the country's nuclear bomb project for the right package of economic benefits.
 
'Somebody Miscalculated'
 "Somebody miscalculated," said a senior Japanese official who has been deeply involved in the issue. "Either it was us or it was him."
North Korea's outright rejection of the United Nations' insistence that it fully open its nuclear sites to inspection continued today. In a statement carried by the state-run news agency, the Government said: "We do not want confrontation. But we do not have the intention to meet an unjustifiable demand under continued pressure and cannot tolerate our sovereignty's being encroached upon."
It again accused the United States of orchestrating a campaign "to stifle our socialist system" and repeated its threats to abandon the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, which would end what little oversight of the nuclear program now exists.
A senior aide to President Kim Young Sam of South Korea, who is traveling in Uzbekistan, said his country was now "determined to impose sanctions against North Korea" through the United Nations.
But he said a balance had to be struck between sanctions that would make Mr. Kim "pay attention" and those that could lead to war. He said South Korea believed that China would not actively oppose sanctions, but in Washington discussions among the allies continued today about the possibility of setting a deadline for North Korea as a way of helping bring China aboard.
Perhaps no authoritarian Government has been as thoroughly psychoanalyzed and dissected over the last four decades, with less satisfying results, as the one run by Mr. Kim and by his son and the heir apparent, Kim Jong Il.
 
Few Convincing Explanations
 Years after North Korean agents assassinated half of the South Korean Cabinet and blew up a South Korean airliner, there are few convincing explanations about what the North hoped to achieve.
And this weekend there was little consensus about how seriously to take the North's warning, in a meandering statement on Friday night, that "economic sanctions would be regarded as a declaration of war."
The uncertainty about the North's endgame has revived the arguments over whether sanctions are vital if the United Nations is to retain any credibility after repeated warnings, or just a futile gesture that will do nothing to stop the nuclear project. The fear is that sanctions, no matter how carefully calibrated, would simply reinforce the North's longstanding fear that it is surrounded by hostile powers.
The Kims say so little in public, and are so sealed off even from North Korea's own closed and stratified society, that any effort to crawl into their heads is almost bound to fail. But many Korea analysts argue that the country's governing clique is haunted by the fall of East Germany.
That theory seemed to be sustained two years ago when reporters and business executives touring the North were bombarded with convoluted theories about why similar events could never happen in the Communist paradise of North Korea.
 
The Economic Situation
 The numbers, of course, suggest a very different story: South Korea, which once looked like the basket case of Asia, now has an economy 15 times the size of the North's. Every year since 1989, North Korea's gross domestic product has shrunk. Recent defectors, whose stories are sometimes enhanced by South Korea's intelligence agencies, report growing food shortages, occasional riots and continued repression.
The dire economic straits are what led many in the Bush and Clinton Administrations to believe that the bomb was a bargaining chip, a view supported by the North's grand plans for free trade zones, new factories and joint ventures with the Japanese.
But there has always been a minority view, one that seems more credible now, that the bomb -- or the ambiguity over whether one exists -- is less useful as a chip than as an insurance policy against German-style unification.
"The bomb," Andrew Mack, a Korea expert at the Australian National University, wrote recently, "offers the North a relatively low-cost strategic equalizer against its many enemies, and forces the rest of the world to take it seriously."
Mr. Mack's view seemed to be echoed in studies last year by the Central Intelligence Agency and its South Korean counterpart. Both concluded that no amount of negotiation would convince the North to abandon its nuclear project -- but also that sanctions would not prove effective.
 
North Is Isolated Already
 The North has survived for so long on so little, many experts say, that deprivation alone cannot seriously weaken the Government.
"How do you isolate the world's most isolated country?" a top adviser to the South Korean President asked a few months ago. "The truth is, it can't be done."
One complication in measuring the likely impact of economic sanctions is that North Korea publishes virtually no economic statistics. But estimates by American and South Korean intelligence agencies, and anecdotal accounts from recent visitors and defectors, make clear that the economy's slide has turned into a plummet.
According to South Korean estimates, North Korea's gross domestic product declined 5.2 percent in 1991, 7.6 percent in 1992 and, by most accounts, even faster last year. More than half of the country's factories are believed to be idle. Grain production was cut by at least a third, because of a particularly poor harvest.
After years of denying that economic troubles exist, the North conceded last December that it needed a drastic new approach. Kim Il Sung publicly abandoned his commitment to the heavy industry symbols of a Stalinist economy, announcing three new priorities: agriculture, light industry and foreign trade.
 
Three Main Trade Partners
 The last category, the one most susceptible to sanctions, accounted for only $2.4 billion last year, mostly with three countries: China, Japan and Russia. But the statistics do not take into account barter between North Koreans and ethnic Koreans across the Chinese border, and that would be virtually impossible to stop, even under strict sanctions.
Mr. Kim's public commitment to an economy that would improve everyday life led many South Korean and American officials to say the country was ready to make a deal. In fact, they said, a concession could be used to bolster the position of Kim Jong Il, who is 52 and a far deeper mystery than his father.
"If Kim Jong Il can finish off the nuclear problem, then he could do anything he wants," Koo Bon Tai, the director general of South Korea's Office of South-North Dialogue, said a few months ago. "They may not be giving away much."
Mr. Koo and other experts have argued that investment and aid, rather than sanctions, would be the fastest way to undercut the North's Government. With foreign money will come foreign ideas, they said, and while few predicted that satellite television dishes would spring up as they have in Beijing -- televisions are almost impossible to find in North Korea -- greater prosperity could spur the rise of "pragmatists" in the North Korean Government.
 
Decision-Making Structure
 "Even an autocratic country like North Korea may not have a very monolithic decision-making structure," Han Sung Joo, the South Korean Foreign Minister, said earlier this year. "There are interests we can appeal to."
This week the advocates of taking a soft line are in retreat. No one knows if the decision to defy the International Atomic Energy Agency was made by Mr. Kim himself, or was a result of a bureaucratic misreading of how far the agency could be pushed. But now, a senior American official in Asia said Saturday, the situation "is radically changed."
"Everyone senses that the North went over some invisible line when they destroyed the record of what they had done in the past with the nuclear fuel, and now they can't call it back," the official said.
But it seems likely that the natural instincts of South Korean and American officials -- not to push too hard, not to risk too much in dealing with the Kims -- will begin to kick in soon.
In the South's mind, the titanic struggle between the two Koreas is essentially over, and Seoul has won. The elder Mr. Kim, they point out, cannot live forever. No one wants the expense of reunification very soon, anyway. And despite their neighbor's hard-line words, few South Koreans seem fearful that Mr. Kim would actually use a nuclear weapon if it had one. Compared with the huge number of conventional weapons the North aims at South Korea, one or two atomic warheads seem like a marginal increase in the threat.
"Our biggest worry," one official in Seoul said, "is not to start a panic."

HEADLINE: Legislators' Agreement on Tax Cuts May End State Budget Impasse

BYLINE: By IAN FISHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ALBANY, June 5

 BODY:
The long battle over the state's $33 billion budget appeared near its end tonight as legislators reviewed two chunks of a new budget plan that calls for almost half a billion dollars in tax cuts, mostly for business, and programs to fix schools and improve stadiums around the state.
The budget was 66 days late tonight and legislative aides said the deal was not yet complete. But in a sign that negotiations were nearly over, the leaders of the Senate and Assembly unveiled for legislators their agreements on tax cuts and capital projects, including a $24 million aquatic center on Long Island and $103 million for other sports facilities. 
 The leaders expected to complete the review on Monday and begin voting immediately on the entire budget, which is fattened this election year with a $1.5 billion surplus. Gov. Mario M. Cuomo said the budget as inexcusably late, but saw it as a sign that the state was on the economic rebound.
 
'It Is a Relief'
 "It is a return to the pre-recession direction of the state," he said in a telephone interview tonight from the Executive Mansion. "After all the pain of the last three years, it is a relief to be getting back tax cuts and investment."
In the agreement, the value of the tax cuts was portrayed as $476 million by the Republican-controlled Senate, but $450 million by the Democratic-controlled Assembly. The difference, aides said, did not alter the substance of the cuts, the largest of which is a three-year phaseout of the 15 percent surcharge on corporate taxes.
The surcharge, instituted during the recession in 1990, will drop to 10 percent later this year, to 5 percent in 1995 and will be eliminated in 1996. Most smaller businesses are expected to save a few hundred dollars a year, but giant corporations could save $100,000 or more.
 
Tax Credit for Families
 The package also includes a tax credit for families that earn less than $25,000 a year. The credit, phased in over four years, would be 7.5 percent of an existing Federal tax credit this year, 10 percent in 1995, 15 percent in 1996 and 20 percent thereafter. That means a family of four earning $11,000 would save $110 this year and $500 in 1997, according to Assembly esimtates.
Also included is the repeal this year of the state's 5 percent portion of the 19.25 percent sales tax on hotel rooms renting for over $100 a night, and of the 10-cent tax on every quart of motor oil.
The capital budget was $5.7 billion, $322 million more than what the Governor requested when he presented his budget in January. Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, Democrat of Manhattan, said the plan includes an new initiative of $62 million for repairs on schools around the state. Of that, $42 million will be slated for New York City schools, though the city cannot use any of the money to close its $2.3 billion gap.
Though Mr. Cuomo had ridiculed the project as too elaborate, the budget includes a $24 million aquatic center in Hempstead, L.I. It also calls for $25 million for Crossroads Arena in Buffalo, $43 million for stadiums in Rochester and Syracuse and roughly $8 million to upgrade eight minor league stadiums.
On Monday, legislators are expected to take up state aid to localities, school aid, fingerprinting for welfare recipients and debt reform.

HEADLINE: New York City Striving to Lure Corporations And New Jobs

BYLINE: By TOM REDBURN 

 BODY:
In recent years, New York City has been so desperate to hold on to companies already in the city that it handed out hundreds of millions of dollars in tax incentives to stem the corporate diaspora.
But now, with clear signs emerging that the local economy is finally on the mend, City Hall is looking outward, trying to lure companies prowling for a new home. 
 That is not an impossible dream, contends Clay Lifflander, appointed by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to run the city's Economic Development Corporation, a quasi-independent agency responsible for improving the city's business climate and providing help to local companies.
 
Talking to Companies
 "We've started talking to several companies, including a big foreign food firm, about coming here," Mr. Lifflander said in an interview. "They didn't laugh at us."
Mr. Lifflander argues that the city has been on the defensive in fighting for business for so long that it appeared to concede the war was lost even before it started. "It created an atmosphere of defeat," he said. "You cannot win every retention battle, so if there's no effort to do some corporate attraction, you just end up with the perception that the city is a perennial loser."
Given the high costs and other difficulties of doing business in New York City, dozens of state and local governments both in nearby suburbs and around the country have kept busy dangling offers in front of New York companies. The latest to hear the siren song may be Mastercard International, which, despite previous tax breaks from the city, is considering relocating 450 jobs to the suburbs. It has recently looked at several office buildings in White Plains in Westchester County and in Stamford, Conn.
 
'Beauty Contest'
 City Hall does not plan to respond by going out of its way to "create dislocations" in other cities, Mr. Lifflander said, but once a company elsewhere has indicated it wants to move, "New York should be in the beauty contest -- we want a chance to make our pitch."
That is a familiar complaint these days. Echoing Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey, who has similarly contended that high taxes and intrusive regulations were driving businesses out of her state, Mr. Lifflander said, "Our message is that New York City is open for business again."
In particular, the Giuliani administration believes it can attract overseas companies seeking a strong location to enter the North American market. It also wants to lure information-oriented companies in search of well-educated employees, and, outside Manhattan, large specialty retailers that have found it difficult to enter the city because of zoning restrictions.
Backing up those claims is evidence the local economic outlook has been improving for more than a year. After losing more than 340,000 jobs in the 1989-92 downturn, the city has gained back at least 50,000 private-sector jobs since the economy hit bottom at the end of 1992. More than 10,000 new jobs were added in the first three months of the year, the largest quarterly gain in six years.
Last month, according to figures released on Friday by the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, New York State added 23,000 jobs, many of them in the city. Unemployment in New York City dropped to 8.4 percent in May, down from 9.5 percent in April and 10.8 percent at the beginning of 1994.
But analysts note that the cyclical upswing is more a response to a general economic expansion across the nation than to any specific local government actions. And some critics argue that the Giuliani administration's effort to attract companies from other areas runs counter to the latest thinking about the best ways to foster local economic development.
 
'Worse Than Most'
 "The landscape is littered with the wreckage of traditional economic development policies aimed at making deals with well-known companies," said Charles F. Sabel, a visiting professor at Columbia University who normally teaches at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "New York has been worse than most."
Mr. Sabel, a specialist in local and regional economic development, said the most innovative state and local governments have largely abandoned the chase for companies on the loose. Instead, they are focusing on providing specialized services to closely related businesses and helping support on-the-job training to develop the work-related skills of local residents.
Just as Grand Rapids, Mich., has followed this strategy to stimulate development of its office-furniture industry, Mr. Sabel suggested, New York City should be working on ways to help, say, the fashion industry react more quickly and become more competitive.
Giuliani administration officials respond that they too are interested in what is being called the third wave of economic development strategies. The newer approach follows the first wave of "smokestack chasing" aimed at attracting branch plants, and a second wave of government-run efforts mostly directed at small business. City Hall, for example, may provide modest incentives for an effort by the business-sponsored New York City Partnership to create a center for computer software companies in an underused office building in downtown Manhattan.
To give added muscle to the city's new development strategy, Mr. Lifflander, 31, a former investment banker, has reorganized the relatively modest-sized agency into a more streamlined operation. He created new divisions for business attraction and retention, property management and financing while eliminating and consolidating other operations.
The Economic Development Corporation, which does not operate under Civil Service restrictions, cut 25 positions but added 22 others, leaving the agency with 204 employees, Mr. Lifflander said. Some people were squeezed out, but most others are staying to perform in new roles.
 
Seed Capital
 The new financing unit, which replaces a small direct-lending program, will aim to magnify the effect of the city's limited funds. It will provide $10 million in seed capital for a privately managed venture-capital operation that officials hope to see generate as much as $135 million to support young businesses.
Support for New York City's effort to attract new companies comes from a surprising source, Gov. Robert P. Casey of Pennsylvania, which spends more money on economic development programs than any other state. "New York City is still a unique place to do business," Governor Casey said in a recent interview. "They've got a good story to tell."

HEADLINE: Can E-Mail Cachet = jpmorgan@park.ave?

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
In late 1990, Alain Pinel Realtors Inc. of Saratoga, Calif., plunged into the electronic age with a vengeance. Employees were given personal computers, and when the company joined the Internet, the global web of computer networks, each worker was assigned an electronic-mail address.
Even in the real estate company's Silicon Valley home, however, the initial reaction to those addresses -- listed on business cards, and thus the outward sign of its high-tech move -- was lukewarm at best. Some agents complained that the arcane computer language -- like jones@apr.com, for example -- looked like messy typographical errors. Potential customers were puzzled. 
 In the last six months or so, those attitudes have changed markedly, said Helen Pastorino, president of the real estate agency.
"We were ridiculed before as being weird or nerdy," Ms. Pastorino said. "But now, our E-mail address is seen as being progressive and with it."
For American business, from big corporations to one-person consulting firms, the electronic-mail address is becoming not just a tool but a status symbol. The person who has one -- or better yet, several -- is instantly regarded as a card-carrying member of the information age, wired for the 90's, not some economic mastodon longing for a three-martini lunch.
But not all network addresses are equal. To the cognoscenti of cyberspace, there is a strict pecking order, all plainly visible in the alphabet soup of letters and punctuation that go into a particular electronic-mail address.
"Your Net address says volumes about who you are, about what community you hang in, and whether you're a cybersnob or a cyberhick," said Paul Saffo, a director of the Institute for the Future, a research organization in Menlo Park, Calif.
More is at stake than impressing colleagues and rivals in the corporate trenches. A rudimentary knowledge of the varied, sprawling realm of computer networks -- known as cyberspace or the Net -- promises to be a useful skill in the job market, especially as the American economy becomes increasingly dependent on information-based products and services. The Harvard Graduate School of Business Administration is preparing a course for next year on the "marketspace," as distinguished from the marketplace, based on the view that products, services, market transactions and business communication will increasingly occur in cyberspace.
"Soon, you will be regarded as a pretty lousy manager if you are not conversant with the electronic world," Jeffrey F. Rayport, an assistant professor at the Harvard business school, said. "And people who live on the Net signal it to each other by having an E-mail address."
To be sure, the social cachet of an electronic-mail address did not start in the business community and extends well beyond it. One sign of the times is "E-Mail Addresses of the Rich and Famous," a compendium of the cyberspace whereabouts of more than 900 people, published last month. The paperback, from the Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, lists people like Bill Clinton (President@Whitehouse.gov), whose network locations are well-known, and Toni Morrison, the novelist, whose electronic addresses are not.
 
'Cold Mailing' on the Network
 The book has rankled some computer-network veterans who say it violates cyberspace etiquette by publicizing the electronic-mail addresses of others. Yet even the rich and famous sometimes benefit from "cold mailing" -- a chance encounter with a stranger on a computer network.
Rush Limbaugh, the conservative commentator, whose network address is in the new book, was married two weeks ago to Marta Fitzgerald. Where did they meet? On Compuserve, a large commercial network.
Yet business people, not celebrities, account for most of the growth on the Net lately. The business use of electronic mail within companies has been common for years, but more and more companies are getting wired to the outside.
It is estimated that 20 million people worldwide are now linked on the Net, which began in 1969 as a Defense Department network intended to survive nuclear attack. Today, the Net is a generic term for some 20,000 computer networks, both noncommercial ones linking government agencies, research labs and universities and commercial networks and on-line services like Prodigy, Compuserve and America Online.
 
Cyberspace Population Boom
 Most of the 20 million participants are Americans, even as the population of cyberspace increases by 15 percent a month, estimates Martha Williams, a professor of information sciences at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The current fivefold-a-year growth rate will inevitably slow, but a couple of hundred million people worldwide are expected to be on computer networks in five years. These days, most of the conscripts, Ms. Williams says, are from the private sector.
And they are being introduced to the byzantine rituals often associated with the use and display of the calling card of the information age: the electronic-mail address.
In high-tech communities, a network address is all but a requirement for membership these days, both in America and, increasingly, abroad. Not having one can mean ostracism. "If you don't have an E-mail address you're not worth talking to," said Robin Saxby, president of Advanced RISC Machines Ltd., a computer chip maker in Cambridge, England.
How to tell a prestigious address from a pedestrian one? Look to the right of the @ sign in an electronic-mail address. It is called the "domain," and it indicates where the mailbox is. Typically, this will be an organization, a company, a university or a commercial network service.
For example, Jane Doe, who works for Widget Enterprises Inc., might have the address: jdoe@widget.com. The domain is usually broken up into subdomains, each separated by a period. The .com is an abbreviation meaning the mailbox is in a commercial organization; others include .edu for education institutions, .gov for government bodies and .net for networking organizations.
In the cyberspace pecking order, bragging rights go to the person whose address is "closer to the Net." For example, one of this reporter's electronic-mail addresses is slohr@aol.com. This is an address at a commercial service, America Online -- that is, a conduit into the Net open to anyone willing to pay the monthly fees. It is not exclusive and not as "close to the Net" as Jane Doe, whose link to the Net is through the technologically with-it company that employs her, Widget Enterprises.
But real status belongs to those very few people whose domain name is their last name -- a direct connection to the Net, the closest anyone can get. Mark Seiden, a computer consultant in Belmont, Calif., who has a sophisticated link to the Internet through a powerful computer at home, is one of the few. His electronic-mail address: MIS@seiden.com.
"It's the ultimate vanity license plate in cyberspace," Mr. Seiden said.
Recently, turf wars have flared over rights to domain names. MTV: Music Television last month sued Adam Curry, a former host, who claimed the name mtv.com. "This is a trademark issue," said Carol Robinson, an MTV spokeswoman.
Wired, a year-old magazine of computer culture in San Francisco, took the same stance in a dispute with the Women's Wire, an on-line service for women, founded in 1992. The editors of the magazine (domain name: wired.com) felt that Women's Wire domain name (wire.net) was too close for commercial comfort.
 
'This Is Real Estate'
 "The domain name is just a brand extension," explained John Battelle, the managing editor of Wired. "This is real estate."
The dispute was settled last year after the women's on-line service agreed to modify its domain to wwire.net, figuring it could not afford a legal battle. "But we're going to see more and more of this in the future," said Nancy Rhine, a director of Women's Wire.
Cyberspace veterans have found computer networks a powerful tool of freewheeling communication, but also a daunting one. Some people get more than 100 electronic missives a day, so they have developed filtering tactics, like having several electronic mail addresses to separate business contacts, family and friends.
There are also differing schools of thought about giving out network addresses. Some people have them on business cards, others do not.
"It's not on my business card, but I do give it to people I really want to get in contact with," said Richard A. Shaffer of Technologic Partners, a consulting firm in New York.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Time Inc. Shelves a Gay Magazine

BYLINE: By DEIRDRE CARMODY 

 BODY:
Time Inc. Ventures, the division of Time Inc. that develops new magazines, has decided not to proceed with Tribe, a publication aimed at gay men and lesbians.
Saying the decision was made for business rather than editorial reasons, company officials said they were too busy with the division's other ventures to devote the necessary energy to the magazine. 
 The decision raises the question of whether a large media company can successfully publish magazines that may draw criticism from its traditional advertisers. But some industry executives say the move may also illustrate the difficulties faced by middle-aged and older executives making decisions about publications devoted to life styles that are often unfamiliar to them.
"Time wants to be part of the generation shift, but the bosses don't know how to address that issue, so when it comes to making tough decisions they don't know how to address them," said a Time Inc. editor who was familiar with the situation.
 
Issue of Economics
 But the company said the decision on Tribe was simply a matter of time and money.
"For us to consider any new business proposition, it does have to be of some scale," said Robert Miller, the president of Time Inc. Ventures. "It's difficult to imagine taking on a magazine that would not make several million dollars annually in profits."
Mr. Miller said he thought Tribe might have a circulation potential of 250,000. However, no existing gay magazine has come near that figure. Out, a two-year-old gay and lesbian life style magazine, reports a circulation of about 100,000, while the 27-year-old Advocate, the nation's oldest news magazine for gay and lesbian readers, says its circulation is 70,000.
"We are discontinuing Tribe because, frankly, our plate is a little too full," Mr. Miller said. "As intrigued as I continue to be with Tribe, we are just flat-out fully occupied pursuing or looking at other ideas that are just a little farther along or projects that have a significantly larger scale as a business."
He denied rumors that there had been pressure to kill the project from the Rev. Donald Wildmon, whose American Family Association has attacked television programs with gay themes. In an interview published Friday in The Washington Times, Mr. Wildmon said that he knew nothing about Tribe and that no letter-writing campaign had been planned.
Mr. Miller said Tribe had been in the earliest stages of consideration. Although he declined to say how much the company had invested in the project, other company officials put the figure at less than $75,000.
 
Attention on Other Projects
 Mr. Miller said current magazine projects at Time Inc. Ventures included Mouth 2 Mouth, Martha Stewart Living and Vibe.
Mouth 2 Mouth, a magazine for teen-agers, published its first test issue in March. Mr. Miller described the results as "terrific," although other people in the company used phrases like "unsure" and "not a slam dunk."
A second issue will go on sale in August, but plans for regular publication are "not a definite go" as of now, Mr. Miller said.
Martha Stewart Living, which started regular publication in 1991 and has soared to a circulation of almost 750,000, is looking into a number of multimedia opportunities. The first of these, a weekly television show, is in its first year. Mr. Miller declined to say whether the magazine had become profitable.
Vibe, an urban culture magazine started in 1992, has had a more difficult time defining itself. It began as a magazine of hip-hop, a type of music that originated in inner-city black neighborhoods and was later embraced by many young white listeners. The magazine has since widened its coverage to include politics and other urban music. It reports a circulation of 200,000.
 
Question of Direction
 The focus of Vibe has been a point of dispute among its staff. What insiders called increasing tensions between its black and white staff members came to a head last month, when, according to published reports, Quincy Jones, the musician and record producer who co-founded the magazine, complained about the proposed June-July cover featuring Madonna because it represented the second month in a row that a white person would be on the cover. (The Beastie Boys had been on the previous cover.) As a result, Jonathan Van Meter, the editor in chief, resigned, saying his editorial control had been compromised.
On Friday, Vibe named Alan Light, the former music editor, as acting editor in chief.
As for Tribe, there may still be a future, according to Maer Roshan, who originally brought the idea for the magazine to Time Inc. Ventures. Mr. Roshan, the former editor in chief of QW, a gay life style magazine that stopped publication in 1992. said last week that he was "still determined to do something with Tribe."
"The gay community needs a magazine like this that is focused on readers rather than advertisers," he said.
"We are living in gritty times and they call for journalism that comes from the soul, rather than articles that consider what Calvin Klein might think."

HEADLINE: R.J. Reynolds Woos Polish Smokers

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WARSAW, June 3

 BODY:
R. J. Reynolds recently opened the first American cigarette manufacturing factory in Eastern Europe, a plant of gleaming glass and green trim set among verdant suburban fields, and said it was doing Poles a favor.
Polish smokers rank among the heaviest smokers in the world. Some surveys show they are the heaviest, preferring unfiltered cigarettes laden with coarse tobacco that gives a pungent aroma and is considered a major cause of death among middle-aged Polish men. 
In a marketing environment free of the antismoking emotion that exists back home, R. J. Reynolds sees itself in a front-line position to persuade Poles to switch to its brands.
"Central Europe is a market of great opportunity and we are able to play a positive role," said Piotr Kwitkowski, a market researcher for R. J. Reynolds in Poland. "We are able to replace something that is very harmful with something that is of better quality. It's obvious that Camel is much less harmful than traditional Polish cigarettes."
Since the collapse of Communism, the major international tobacco companies have been feverishly pursuing the Polish market for an obvious reason: An estimated 90 billion cigarettes are sold yearly in a country of only 38.5 million people. Beyond the Polish market lies easy export access to the heavy smokers in the former Soviet Union.
The World Health Organization estimates that from 1990 to 1992, adult Poles smoked 3,620 cigarettes a year, an increase from 3,400 a decade earlier, making Poles the world's heaviest smokers. Greece and Hungary followed Poland in the W.H.O. survey, with the United States in eighth position, said Dr. J. R. Menchaca, the manager of W.H.O.'s tobacco program. According to the health organization, 42 percent of adult Poles smoked in 1992, up from 40 percent in 1990. By contrast, an estimated 25 to 27 percent of American adults smoke.
W.H.O. estimates that about 80,000 Poles "are killed by tobacco" each year, accounting for one of the highest death rates from smoking in the world, Mr. Menchaca said.
 
Poles Smoke Everywhere
 Surveys show no decline in the number of Polish smokers, although health warnings on cigarette packs have been mandatory since 1992 and health warnings started to appear on print and billboard cigarette advertising this month.
Poles smoke everywhere: walking along the streets, while shopping and even in the bathrooms of public hospitals. The habit is so accepted that Foreign Minister Andrej Olechowski lights up Camels during meetings.
But R. J. Reynolds detects a trend to milder cigarettes, which it believes is a good sign for its business. In the first few months of this year, for example, Poland's cheapest brand, Popularne -- about 25 cents a pack, or a quarter of the price here of Reynolds's Camels -- was replaced by a slightly more expensive local brand, Klubowe, as the best seller.
"Klubowe is also awful but they have a filter," Mr. Kwitowski said. "Reynolds thinks this is a positive trend for them, a very slight shift to a milder cigarette that is not so smelly."
 
A $33 Million Plant
 By opening its own plant at a cost of $33 million, R. J. Reynolds bucked the path that it and the other companies have taken in Eastern Europe and it won an important round against its archrival Philip Morris. In other countries in the region -- Hungary, the Czech Republic, Ukraine and Russia -- the cigarette companies have bought often-rundown plants once owned by the state as the fastest track into the Eastern European markets.
Philip Morris bet on this approach in Poland, and hoped to buy a Polish plant in the southern city of Cracow, where the company has had a licensing agreement to produce Marlboros since 1973. But Philip Morris encountered public and political opposition to selling what was perceived as a "crown jewel" of Polish industry to foreigners.
After four years of negotiation, a letter of intent by Philip Morris and announcements by the Polish Government that Philip Morris would pay more than $200 million for the Cracow plant, there has still been no sale. "We're waiting for the Government to say how it wants to proceed," said Michael Parsons, a spokesman for the company in Lausanne, Switzerland.
 
A Government License
 R. J. Reynolds says it understood early on that, unlike in Ukraine where it bought two fairly antiquated state-run cigarette enterprises, there would be difficulties in buying one of the plants in Poland. "Due to a number of reasons we found we couldn't meet each other," said Piotr Piwkowski, the general manager of the new Polish factory. "We immediately started to go our own way and start from scratch."
In early 1991, R. J. Reynolds got a license from the Ministry of Agriculture to manufacture cigarettes and started to build its 17th wholly owned factory in the world. (The company also produces under license at 23 other factories). Through a Western executive search firm, the company found Mr. Piwkowski, a civil engineer who was the chairman of a Gdansk shipyard, to supervise the construction as well as run the plant.
"The concept was very clear, a huge market of 90 billion sticks," said Mr. Piwkowski, "and considering border taxes, you have to produce locally or you're out of the market."
At the factory in the Warsaw suburb of Piaseczno, R. J. Reynolds now controls the local manufacture of its three leading international brands -- Camel, Winston and Salem -- and has introduced a new local brand, 777, to compete against Popularne and Klubowe. At the opening of the plant, the company noted that not only the size of the market but the "lower cost of production" made Poland an attractive investment.
Mr. Piwkowski acknowledged that the $33 million cost of the factory was "not a lot" and that the wages for skilled workers were "relatively cheap." The plant, which has 250 permanent employees, will have the capacity to produce 12 billion cigarettes within two years, Mr. Piwkowski said. Capacity can grow to 15 billion, he said, which is about half the capacity of the plant in Cracow that Philip Morris wants to acquire.
The heart of the battle will be to increase the share of American-blended cigarettes from the current 8 percent of the total Polish market. "We are interested in addressing the upper end of the price segment," said Thomas E. Marsh, the regional manager for Eastern Europe of R. J. Reynolds. "Our interest is not to increase the per capita smoking but to have the people who are already smoking smoke more of our brands."
Philip Morris's Marlboro remains the most popular American blended cigarette in Poland. R. J. Reynolds estimates that Marlboro accounts for 3 percent of the market and Camel about 2 percent. But with a fairly vigorous advertising campaign dusted off from the United States -- "A Taste for Adventure" with the macho Camel man canoeing and climbing -- brand awareness has come on a par with Marlboro, R. J. Reynolds says.
But because of the limited purchasing power of Polish smokers, it is likely to be a long slog. Paying $1 for a pack of Camels is a lot of money on a monthly average salary of around $200. Tobacco company officials said they were prepared to be patient. It will be a while, they said, before a pack of foreign cigarettes stops being just a status symbol of the well-off or a splurge to make an impression on a weekend date.
In raw numbers, 1.3 billion cigarettes were sold out of the new R. J. Reynolds plant last year, Mr. Piwkowski said. The company hopes to double that number as the plant gets up to speed this year. Marlboro, according to its spokesman, Mr. Parsons, doubled its sales from two billion cigarettes four years ago to four billion last year.
In five years, American-blended cigarettes should account for 13 to 15 percent of the market in Poland.
"It's a growing economy, the standard of living is slightly improving," Mr. Piwkowski said. "But there are other needs, not just smoking a pack of Camel. Maybe improving your standard of living means smoking Camel, but maybe it means traveling to Miami."

For banks, the bloated balance sheet is becoming undesirable.

BYLINE: By Saul Hansell 

 BODY:
AT lunch in Beverly Hills, Calif., they say you can never be too rich or too thin. In the corporate dining rooms of the nation's banks, the refrain has been you can never have too much capital.
Now, while fat waistlines may not be in fashion, fat balance sheets are becoming passe. 
 It's not that banks want their balance sheets to return to the scrawny waif-like state of the late 1980's, when capital was severely depleted by waves of bad loans to developing countries and real estate ventures. But banks now have more money than they know what to do with, so they are giving some back to shareholders by sharply increasing dividends and repurchasing their own stock.
On Friday, for example, the Chemical Banking Corporation said it would buy back up to 10 million shares, almost 4 percent of those outstanding, in the next year. At today's price, that would mean spending as much as $420 million. Chemical will also redeem $374 million of preferred stock, issuing only about $200 million in new preferred stock at a lower rate.
Other companies, including J.P. Morgan & Company, First Chicago, and Bank of New York are also buying back their shares.
Bank capital is the money supplied by investors and from earnings not paid out as dividends. Since the late 1980's, regulators have required banks to build reserves because the more capital a bank has, the more losses it can absorb before it fails.
Bank capital was drained in 1990 because of bad real estate loans. Since then, banks have raised new capital by stock sales. And as interest rates fell and loan losses receded, bank earnings soared, lifting capital to the highest levels in decades.
Investors, of course, don't want banks to be undercapitalized because it increases the risk of failure. On the other hand, having too much capital dilutes earnings.
Chemical's buyback, for example, will increase its earnings per share by about 2 percent this year, Ronald I. Mandle, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, estimates. "It's not a giant step, but it shows they are interested in enhancing shareholder value," he said.
Moreover, many investors now worry that if banks have too much capital, they will be tempted to spend it unwisely. "By returning their capital to shareholders, banks show they have their best interests in mind and will not do something foolish like making bad loans or paying too much for acquisitions," Mr. Mandle said.
Mr. Mandle recently did a study that looked at 22 banks that made the best use of shareholder capital, based on buyback programs, increased dividends, low prices paid for acquisitions and whether the banks paid for acquisitions with cash rather than stock. The top banks studied were the PNC Bank Corporation, Nationsbank and the First Union Corporation. The worst were Barnett Banks, the Mellon Bank Corporation and the Bank of New York Company. While other factors also play into stock picking, Mr. Mandle says he recommends all three top-ranked banks.
But others see problems in this view of capital.
"Capital is hard to come by, and the banks are squandering it," said Eugene J. Sherman, research director of M. A. Schapiro & Company, a brokerage firm that specializes in banks. Most banks, he said, are buying their stock at well above book value. And the banks are likely to need the capital later to pay for acquisitions and to back loans. "It is a very short-term strategy," Mr. Sherman said.
Peter Tobin, Chemical's chief financial officer, said the company had not lost flexibility because it could easily issue more shares later. Even with the share buyback, he said, the bank is likely to have higher capital a year from now than it does today, though it may consider buying more shares.
In addition, Chemical will be forced to issue more shares later because of employee stock options and possible redemptions of its convertible preferred stock. The program lets the company buy the shares it needs at what it figures is a cheaper price now.
"We think our stock is undervalued now, and there is the potential for a significant increase," Mr. Tobin said. This, he conceded, may well be a self-fulfilling prophecy. "A share buyback signals the market that you think the stock is undervalued," he said.

HEADLINE: New York City Seeks to Sell U.N. Plaza Hotel to Help Close Deficit

BYLINE: By ASHLEY DUNN 

 BODY:
The very thought of checking into a hotel owned by a city government that faces a $2.3 billion deficit might be enough to send some tourists screaming back to Kansas.
Yet New York City has managed to become one of the premier hoteliers in town. For nearly 20 years it has owned the sparkling pair of blue-glass-and-steel towers above the East River known as the United Nations Plaza Hotel. 
 The four-star hotel, which was given to the city, has turned a profit every year of its existence, with the city's share amounting to roughly $1 million.
And now the city wants to sell it.
To help close the deficit, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has proposed putting the hotel on the market for between $70 million and $90 million, for a potential gain of $65 million once debt is paid off.
 
Hurdles Ahead
 But real-estate brokers say this is not the best time to sell, since the market is only beginning to recover from the recession and could generate a higher price in a year or two. The proposal has several other major hurdles to overcome, like winning the blessing of the Internal Revenue Service and a host of city boards.
But city officials are confident. "There's tens of millions to be made, and it really makes sense to sell it," said Lance Carlile, vice president of Manhattan development for the New York City Economic Development Corporation, which is handling the sale. "It's not like it cost the city anything. Most of what we'll get will be profit."
Except for cashing a rent check every month, the city has had little to do with the 428-room hotel, at East 44th Street and First Avenue.
The city owns the land and building, but the hotel is managed by the United Nations Development Corporation, a nonprofit group created by the city and the state to construct and finance buildings for the United Nations. Day-to-day operations are left to the Hyatt International Corporation.
The hotel was built in 1976 as part of a larger project to help meet the demands of the United Nations, which had grown from 51 original missions to more than 120 by the mid-1960's.
 
Solving a Problem
 At the time there was a shortage of office space, and no company seemed willing to build a hotel as far east midtown as the United Nations, said Thomas Appleby, president of the development corporation. The situation had reached the point where the United Nations was considering moving out of New York City.
With about $4 million, the development corporation bought several properties and contracted with the architect Kevin Roche to design a combination office building and hotel, One United Nations Plaza.
But there was a problem. Because the corporation owned the land, it would have to pay real-estate taxes on the development, which would increase rents. It might also insult the United Nations, which does not pay taxes but would be doing so indirectly through higher rents. To solve the problem, the corporation simply gave the whole project to the city, which does not tax its own properties.
The city took ownership of the $35 million development, striking a deal in which the United Nations would pay no taxes but an equal amount in rent.
In 1984, the corporation completed an expansion project, Two United Nations Plaza, and gave the building to the city under a similar agreement.
Under Mr. Giuliani's proposal, most of the development would remain in city hands. Only the hotel, which occupies the top quarter of each tower, and a proportional share of the land underneath would be sold. The office space in the complex would still belong to the city.
 
Advice to Wait
 Franklin Speyer, a senior director with the real-estate firm Cushman & Wakefield Inc., said that if the city were his client, he would recommend waiting another year or two as prices recover from the recession.
He said that from a peak in 1989, prices had dropped by as much as half by mid-1993. But he added that prices had bounced back by up to 20 percent since then, and if the city needed to sell, it would no longer be bailing out at the market low.
"We passed rock bottom a long time ago," Mr. Speyer said. "They shouldn't have any problem with this sale."
Before the city can even put the hotel on the market, the deal must first be reviewed by a variety of city agencies, a process that could take as long as six months. And because the development was built by a nonprofit corporation with tax-exempt bonds, the United Nations Development Corporation needs a ruling from the I.R.S. on whether the sale to a private company would affect earnings of bond holders.
Mr. Carlile of the Economic Development Corporation said he could see no reason why anyone would contest the sale.
"I doubt anyone will notice, except there might be a name change," he said.

Soybean and Grain Prices Drop on Rain in the Midwest

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Soybean and grain prices fell sharply yesterday as weekend showers in the Midwest and forecasts for more rain this week dispelled concern that dry weather could damage crops.
Those declines, along with drops in coffee and lumber prices, helped push the Commodity Research Bureau's index down 3.21 points, to 228.84, its low since May 16. 
 As much as 1.5 inches of rain fell in the western crop region of Nebraska, Kansas and Iowa. More showers were expected by midweek. And up to an inch of rain is forecast to arrive by Thursday in the eastern Corn Belt of Illinois, Indiana and Ohio, according to the Weather Services Corporation.
 
 
'Good Week for Crops'
 "The rainfall should be enough to ease most of the concerns about dry weather," said Mike Palmerino, Weather Services' senior agricultural meteorologist. "This should be a good week for crops in the Midwest."
Soybeans for November delivery, which represent this year's crop, touched their 30-cent daily limit before closing down 28.75 cents at $6.3100 a bushel. July soybeans fell 25.75 cents, to $6.5925 a bushel, on the Chicago Board of Trade.
July corn fell as low as $2.6150 before closing at $2.6550 a bushel, down 8 cents. But July wheat gained 1 cent, to $3.3125 a bushel.
On other commodity markets, coffee prices fell to a four-week low amid traders' expectations that supplies would grow as the harvest progresses in Brazil and Colombia, the world's two largest coffee-producing nations.
July coffee fell 5.30 cents, to $1.1925 a pound, at the New York Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange.
Traders will begin issuing notices to deliver coffee in two weeks. While delivery notices in May were less than a quarter of their normal size, helping prices to rise to a five-year high, that number is expected to be closer to normal now that the harvest has begun.
 
 
Lumber Prices
 Elsewhere, lumber prices fell amid expectations that higher mortgage interest rates would reduce demand, traders said. Lumber for July delivery fell the $10 trading limit, to $383.30 for 1,000 board feet, at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
"We have not seen much business for about a week and a half now," said Bud Merrill, an analyst with Smith Barney in Portland, Ore.
Cash prices were quoted yesterday at $370 to $375 for 1,000 board feet, down from $375 to $380 quoted on Friday, said Bill O'Neill, chief futures strategist with Merrill Lynch in New York.
The Commerce Department said last week that sales of new single-family homes fell 6.3 percent in April, the first drop in three months, as higher mortgage rates kept buyers away.

HEADLINE: Man Shoots Wife to Death As She Holds Their Infant

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER 

 BODY:
After weeks of quarreling with his wife, Thomas Rodriguez surprised her yesterday morning at the elevator outside the door of a Bronx apartment and shot her to death as she cradled an infant in her arms, a 3-year-old at her side, the police said.
The woman, Joselina Quezada, dropped the infant and collapsed with four bullets in her body. Mr. Rodriguez then raised his .38-caliber revolver to his temple and killed himself with a single shot. 
 When a neighbor cracked the door of his third-floor apartment to take a look, the police said, the 3-year-old, Jermin Quezada, was holding the gun. "The kid says, 'Papi shot Mami,' " said Sgt. Daniel J. Howell, of the 44th Precinct detective squad.
Neither Jermin nor his 10-month-old brother, Johnson, were injured, the police said.
But all day, as detectives and reporters came and went at the apartment, at 85 McClellan Street in High Bridge, the older child would tug at the pants of whoever would listen and retell in Spanish how his father had killed his mother and then committed suicide.
Only the night before, Ms. Quezada, 23, had gone in tears to a police station house in the Washington Heights section of Manhattan, to report that her husband of four years had punched her, pulled her hair and taken her purse on the sidewalk near the hair salon where she worked, at 155th Street and Broadway.
"The cops tried to find him, but they couldn't," said Herminia Quezada, the young woman's mother.
The murder and suicide were precisely the kind of crimes that Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani had hoped to head off when he announced in April that he was assigning a police officer and detective in every precinct to focus on domestic violence. It was not clear yesterday whether the 34th Precinct, where Ms. Quezada reported the assault by her husband on Sunday, has yet set up a team to deal with domestic violence. But Lieut. James T. Malvey said the police officers who tried to find Mr. Rodriguez had done everything possible.
"It's not a perfect system," he said, "but its far superior to what we had. Rather than referring complaints to the court, we have an aggressive arrest policy. We have detectives go out and look for them."
The 44th Precinct, where the shootings occurred, has a domestic-violence team made up of police officers. Like 11 other precincts in the city, it also has a handful of counselors from Victim Services, a nonprofit social services organization under contract to the city that offers counseling and shelter to victims of domestic abuse. Victim Services also provides counseling to the partner who resorts to violence, according to Maureen Geoglis, the deputy director of the organization's police programs.
The 34th Precinct, where the reported assault took place about 8 P.M. Sunday, shortly after Ms. Quezada got off work, does not have a Victim Services team. But even if it had, it is unlikely that it would have been helpful in this case. Because of financial constraints on the city, Ms. Geoglis said, the counselors work only five days a week, during regular business hours.
"If a report had been filed Sunday evening," Ms. Geoglis said, "we would have attempted to contact the person the following day."
But that would have been too late. Mr. Rodriguez, 24, was crouching in a stairwell, the police said, when his wife and two children left her mother's apartment at 8:15 A.M. yesterday.
The police said that three weeks ago, Mr. Rodriguez, an unemployed furniture mover, had moved out of the apartment he had shared with his wife and children at St. Ann's and 138th Streets in the South Bronx. He had beaten his wife then, the family said, and she was still carrying bruises from that incident on her lower back when she died.
Five days ago, Lieutenant Malvey said, Ms. Quezada was apparently concerned for her safety, and she moved into her mother's apartment with the children.
Sergeant Howell said that after checking with several police precincts and interviewing the family, investigators concluded that Ms. Quezada had not sought police help until Sunday night.
For the elder Mrs. Quezada, who now faces the task of raising her daughter's two young boys, the shootings were tragic in every way. Though the couple's relationship had been stormy, she had thought highly of her daughter's husband, who, like her and her daughter, had come from the Dominican Republic.
"He was a good father," Mrs. Quezada said. "But he was jealous and didn't want her to leave with the children."

HEADLINE: Job Agency Head Resigns After a Report Criticizes Spending

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON 

 BODY:
The president of the New York State Job Development Authority announced her resignation yesterday, hours after the state Inspector General criticized her for spending about $10,000 in agency money on personal expenses like credit card bills.
The Inspector General, George R. Moresco, also found that the job agency's $99,750-a-year president, Audrey P. Bynoe, had improperly used staff members and equipment for political activities. The inspector general's report said the authority lacked the management checks and balances needed to prevent the kinds of abuses Mr. Moresco said had taken place. 
 Separately, Mr. Moresco said that he was continuing his investigation of the job agency's dealings with the Wall Street firm of W. R. Lazard, the largest minority-owned money-management house. Its founder, Wardell R. Lazard, was found dead of alcohol and cocaine poisoning in a Pittsburgh hotel room last month.
The Manhattan District Attorney's office is also investigating the Lazard firm's work for the agency, which was set up to provide loans and loan guarantees for struggling companies.
 
Acting Head Named
 Ms. Bynoe, who had been president of the job authority since January 1992 and was vice president for six months before that, issued a statement with Vincent Tese, the state director of economic development, in which they both agreed on the need for stricter financial controls at the agency. But Mr. Tese, in an interview later, appeared to be putting distance between himself and Ms. Bynoe, calling the inspector general's report "pretty damaging."
Then, referring to Ms. Bynoe and her lawyer, Victor Kovner, Mr. Tese added, "Unless you can refute all the facts, it's pretty difficult for them to contend with."
Mr. Tese said he had not asked Ms. Bynoe, a former aide to Assemblyman Albert Vann of Brooklyn, to step down. "They pre-empted that question by resigning," he said.
He named Lee Webb, the executive vice president of the state Urban Development Corporation, as acting president of the job agency. He said the Urban Development Corporation's deputy general counsel, Anita Laremont, would replace Kenneth McLaughlin as the general counsel at the Job Development Authority.
The report said the inspector general "could not substantiate" an allegation that Ms. Bynoe might have provided inaccurate information to New York Newsday in response to a Freedom of Information Law request about the agency's salary-advance program. "However," the report said, "Bynoe appears to have furnished misleading information to Newsday" about the agency's payment of her personal expenses.
The inspector general's report said that Mr. McLaughlin provided Newsday with a list that included only one of Ms. Bynoe's salary advances and that his action "could appear to have been misleading."
 
Challenging the Report
 The investigation began after the authority dismissed its treasurer and chief financial officer, James Blaine, last year. He maintained that the dismissal was retaliation for his having brought "questionable financial transactions undertaken or approved by her" to Ms. Bynoe's attention.
Mr. Kovner took issue with what he called "false facts" in the report, challenging the inspector general's finding that Ms. Bynoe had borrowed more than $25,000 from the authority and had repaid all but $177 through payroll deductions. The amount that Ms. Bynoe owed was never more than $8,000 at any one time, Mr. Kovner said. "It was all paid as soon as any indebtedness was made known to her," he said.
The inspector general said Ms. Bynoe was the only job agency employee who used payroll deductions to reimburse the agency for advances against her salary. The inspector general said that in February 1991, when she was the agency's executive vice president, Ms. Bynoe ordered the agency's finance office to deduct $100 from six paychecks to cover a $614.47 car rental expense.
Ms. Bynoe first told the inspector general's investigators that she rented the car while vacationing in Florida. Later, the report said, "she stated that she rented the car in Albany, N.Y., for use during a period of unpaid leave she took to assist the Black and Puerto Rican Legislative Caucus."
The report said she received $4,500 from the caucus, including $774.47 for "travel and car rental." The report said that because she received a lump-sum reimbursement, she should have repaid the agency all at once, instead of in installments.

HEADLINE: O.E.C.D. Being Pressed To Change Its Mission

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PARIS, June 5

 BODY:
Long respected as a low-profile "think tank" that monitors and forecasts the economic performance of the industrialized world, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development is under pressure to broaden its horizons by opening its doors to more members and involving itself in shaping global economic policy.
As a result, the organization's annual ministerial meeting, which usually only interests economists, has assumed special importance. At stake when it opens here Tuesday is whether the 25-nation organization can adjust to the changing global economy. 
 In recent years, this economy has changed significantly, with the emergence of fast-growing Asian economies, the adoption of free market systems by the former Soviet bloc, the creation of a single European market and passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement. And these changes now affect the O.E.C.D.
The United States is leading the drive to modernize the Paris-based body, from the largely monitoring role it now fills to one carrying more influence with the making of global economic policy. In an address here on Wednesday, Secretary of State Warren Christopher is expected to detail how the Clinton Administration believes the O.E.C.D. can become more relevant today.
Its readiness to change will become apparent in the coming months in its choice of the organization's next Secretary General. The current office-holder, Jean-Claude Paye, who has already served two five-year terms, is seeking re-election, but the United States feels it is time for new blood.
 
Postwar Roots
 Created in 1948 as the Organization for European Economic Cooperation to help enact the Marshall Plan, the O.E.C.D. assumed its present name and began taking in new non-European members in 1961. But after New Zealand joined in 1973, the "rich man's club" admitted no new member for the next 21 years.
This year, after strong lobbying from the United States, Mexico became its 25th member. But some members like Portugal, Greece and Mexico have lower per-capita income than several Asian countries like South Korea, which now seek a place in the organization.
The O.E.C.D. already considers Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia to be "partners in transition" since, as democracies with market economies, they have met the basic conditions of membership. And, on Wednesday, the "club" will for the first time sign a cooperation agreement with Russia.
Russia will be able to participate in some committees and benefit from the O.E.C.D.'s expertise through regional and country-specific reports. But the new link is also of symbolic importance. For some experts, it was Moscow's decision to withdraw from the Marshall Plan organization that set the stage for the cold war.
"You could say that this agreement closes the final pages of the final chapter of the cold war," an American official said. "Russia is not yet a major world economic player, but it won't be long before it is. We will now be able to see this frontier economy in action."
The United States also hopes to turn the O.E.C.D.'s attention toward the trade issues of the 1990's so that the many economists on its 1,900-member staff can support the work of the World Trade Organization, which will succeed the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade on Jan. 1.
Washington's insistence that the new trade body debate the links between trade and the environment and between trade and labor rights has met strong opposition from many developing countries, notably in Asia, which fear moves toward nontariff protectionism.
By encouraging the O.E.C.D. to study these and other trade-related issues, such as competition and investment, the United States and some European countries hope to develop what one American official called "objective criteria" that could influence the World Trade Organization.
A more immediate problem facing the O.E.C.D. member countries is the unemployment that now affects 35 million of their residents. The problem of joblessness has dominated a series of recent summit meetings of the European Union and the Group of Seven industrialized nations without any solution emerging.
In its own two-year study of the problem, the O.E.C.D. focused primarily on whether high unemployment is structural or cyclical and concluded that it has elements of both conditions. Its 50-page report, "Growth and Employment," is to be presented to economic ministers meeting here on Tuesday.
Many of its ideas seem likely to be addressed to the 12-nation European Union. Western Europe's current 11.2 percent unemployment rate, compared with 6 percent in the United States, is widely attributed to minimum wage laws and generous unemployment and other social benefits that inflate the cost of creating jobs.
"It is much better to have people on a salary, perhaps not a very high one, than to have people unemployed," Mr. Paye said last week.
But the key question this week is whether individual countries will agree to enact recommendations that are often fraught with political risks. And it is here that the O.E.C.D.'s future may be defined. "We want it to address itself more to policy makers and political leaders than to bureaucrats," one American official said.
For this reason, then, the United States believes a "new" O.E.C.D. needs a new leader. And it is backing the candidacy of Donald Johnston, a Canadian who served in Pierre Trudeau's Cabinet and is a former leader of Canada's Liberal Party.
Washington hoped a decision would be made this week, but European governments have asked for more time. France is backing Mr. Paye, whose current term ends on Sept. 30; Britain has put forward the candidacy of Nigel Lawson, a former Chancellor of the Exchequer under Margaret Thatcher, and Germany has proposed its former GATT negotiator, Lawrence Schomerus.

Lawyer Joins Wasserstein; Latin Focus

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS FRANTZ 

 BODY:
Mario L. Baeza, a Wall Street lawyer with short-lived diplomatic aspirations, switched careers yesterday and joined the Wasserstein Perella Group as a senior executive who will concentrate on building Latin American business for the New York investment bank.
"Every so often the spirit of adventure calls," said Mr. Baeza, who is leaving the law firm of Debevoise & Plimpton, where he started 20 years ago after graduating from Harvard Law School. 
 Mr. Baeza, 43, who had been a partner and founder of the firm's 30-member Latin America group, will be president of Wasserstein Perella International, chief executive of the company's Latin American operations and co-head of its operations in Spain and Portugal.
 
More Direct Role in Deals
 In many ways, Mr. Baeza said, his new job will be like his old one, concentrating on developing new business opportunities in Latin America. But, as an investment banker, he said, he will have a more direct role in putting deals together and in following them to conclusion.
"There is a one-step-removed quality to being a lawyer, where your success and what you get paid" are not necessarily functions of whether deals actually close, Mr. Baeza said. "This is going to be different."
One place where Mr. Baeza said he hoped to do a lot of business eventually is Cuba, which is now under an American trade embargo. Mr. Baeza's parents were born in Cuba, and, although he was born in Montclair, N.J., the family moved back to Havana for four years when he was a child. It was his longtime interest in seeing Cuba opened eventually for business opportunities that scuttled his diplomatic dreams last year.
 
Opposition From Anti-Castroites
 Mr. Baeza was scheduled to become Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs, the State Department's top Latin American post, in the spring of 1993. At the last minute, the Clinton Administration scratched his name from a list of nominees sent to the Senate after Cuban-American groups and their supporters in Congress protested that Mr. Baeza would not be tough enough toward Cuba's leader, Fidel Castro.
"The whole experience made me take a step back and think about what I was doing," Mr. Baeza said. "I decided maybe it was time for career No. 2."
Barry R. Bryan, Debevoise & Plimpton's presiding partner, said of Mr. Baeza, "His new job is really a perfect fit for his deal-making talents, which he exhibited as a lawyer, and his interests in Latin America."
 
Role in Telmex Deal
 While at the law firm, Mr. Baeza worked on deals that involved Wasserstein Perella. One was the Mexican Government's 1990 sale of control of its national telephone company to an international consortium.
When Mr. Baeza was still a youngster, his family returned to New Jersey, where his father became chairman of the economics, marketing and research department at Seton Hall University. Mr. Baeza was good enough on his high school baseball team to be offered a tryout with an Atlanta Braves farm team but chose instead to go to Cornell University and then Harvard Law School.
He and his wife, Della, also a lawyer, have two daughters and a son.

Opening what is likely to be a bitterly fought battle, the tobacco industry officially began its campaign yesterday to challenge a set of proposals that would ban smoking in virtually all public places in New York City.
The City Council's Health Committee opened hearings on the bill with a full day of often-spirited testimony that drew a broad array of people, from anti-smoking advocates and public officials to tobacco industry spokesmen, restaurateurs and cancer victims. 
 The bill, introduced three months ago by Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone, has been endorsed in principle by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, backed fully by all five borough presidents and is considered likely to pass in some form.
The bill would force all employers, no matter their size, to confine smoking to enclosed areas with specialized ventilation systems, limiting such rooms to one on each floor of a building. Smoking would also be restricted to separate rooms in pool halls and separate sections of outdoor cafes. It would also be banned in Yankee and Shea Stadiums and in outdoor areas of child-care agencies.
To conduct its campaign, the tobacco industry has hired two veteran lobbyists with close ties to Mr. Vallone: Martin J. McLaughlin, who heads a public-relations and lobbying firm and is a friend of the speaker, and Norman Adler, a consultant and former political adviser to Mr. Vallone. The lobbyists also have close ties with several other Democratic legislators.
In an interview yesterday, Mr. Vallone acknowledged his friendship with the two lobbyists, but added that he also has close ties with Joseph W. Cherner, president of Smokefree Educational Services, an anti-smoking advocacy group.
"Lobbyists have the ability to help me to gather information and look at all sides of an issue," Mr. Vallone said. "But I make my own decisions." Of Mr. Adler and Mr. McLaughlin, the speaker said, "They have the same influence that any other lobbyist would have."
While tobacco industry representatives said they expected the bill to pass, they said they hoped at least to weaken or eliminate some proposed restrictions.
"We're trying to go for a defeat of the bill," Thomas Lauria, assistant to the president of the Washington-based Tobacco Institute, said in an interview. "But barring that, we'll go for making it as easy to live with as possible. One thing is for sure: a total ban on smoking is unacceptable to many people, not only in the tobacco industry, but in the hotel and motel industry and even civic groups."
Tobacco industry officials said yesterday that they planned heavy lobbying of Mr. Vallone and individual Council members. They said their strategy centered on two premises: that second-hand smoke is not the hazard that several medical reports say it is, and that the bill would be too costly for small businesses, particularly restaurants.
Leaders of good-government groups said the tobacco industry did not have a history of making large contributions to City Council members. But they said they expected it to be vigilant in lobbying Council members by bringing restaurant and business owners to future hearings.
"The strategy of the tobacco lobby in New York City is no different than their strategy in other parts of the country," said Chris Meyer, a lawyer with the New York Public Interest Research Group, which supports the bill. "It is to hire the best-connected lobbyists to try and influence the best-connected legislators. The strategy is to do private meetings with the leadership and, at some point, bring out the rank and file."
The rank and file in this case means owners of restaurants and hotels, who generally oppose the bill. "About 35 percent of all business travelers and visitors who stay at our hotels are international visitors who are determined smokers," said Joseph Spinnato, president of the Hotel Association of New York City, at the hearing. "As a result, this proposed legislation will unfairly impact on many of our hotels that specifically cater to these travelers."
Some officials of restaurant associations said at the hearing that they objected to a provision in the bill that would require smoking areas to have specially built ventilation equipment. "The bottom line is simply that this legislation would have a serious economic impact on the food-service industry of New York City," said Fred G. Sampson, president of the New York State Restaurant Association, a trade group.

HEADLINE: Signs of Life After Pan Am;
Thousands of Workers Stranded by Airline's Sudden Demise Find Training and Jobs

BYLINE: By TOM REDBURN 

 BODY:
John Wallace remembers the day Pan American World Airways flew for the last time: the Kennedy International Airport maintenance shop where he had worked as a machinist for 24 years was "the quietest thing I've ever seen in my life."
"There was no screaming, no complaining," he said. "We all just got our tools and left." 
 For about 2,500 Pan Am workers who lost their jobs that day -- three weeks before Christmas in 1991 -- the future could not have looked much bleaker. Not only was the New York region, where 85 percent of Pan Am's employees lived, in the midst of its most severe economic downturn since the Great Depression, but the entire airline industry was also experiencing its worst financial turmoil ever. More than a dozen Pan Am workers who lost their jobs committed suicide within months of the shutdown, while many others left the job market altogether.
But most of the other workers have defied the grim expectations and made fresh starts, largely through an unusually successful job-placement program sponsored by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey under a $6 million Federal grant. Roughly three out of four workers who entered the program, called Career Connections, have found employment or entered job retraining, compared with two out of three people in Federal job-placement programs nationwide.
"We learned that one of the most important things we had to offer was simply a place for people to go," said Kenneth Ryan, president of the Employment and Training Institute, which operated Career Connections for former Pan Am employees at Kennedy Airport for two years. "The key was to be there from the beginning, when people were hurting the most."
Amid all the talk of corporate cutbacks and layoffs among middle managers and other white-collar employees, it is easy to forget that by far the largest number of those whose jobs were lost in the last few years wore some kind of uniform to work.
 
Tough Times for Blue-Collar Workers
 Unemployment among semiskilled workers averaged 17 percent in the New York area last year, compared with 5.3 percent among executives and managers. Even among highly skilled manual workers, more than one in eight were jobless.
Pan Am's blue-collar workers had particular reason to be discouraged. They had already agreed to at least two rounds of sharp reductions in pay and benefits to help keep the airline going, to no avail. With little cash and already under bankruptcy protection, the company shut down without warning, offering no severance pay, no unused-vacation pay, and ending paid health coverage that day.
Most of those laid off by Pan Am, once the world's most far-flung airline and the pride of American carriers, had a hard time imagining working anywhere else. While more than 5,000 of its workers were immediately hired by Delta Air Lines, which took over many of Pan Am's routes, at least 2,500 were left out in the cold.
The largest share of the 2,323 participants in Career Connections were mechanics, mostly men in their late 40's or early 50's who had been with the company for 20 years or more. Too young to retire, they were also too old to begin a new career easily. Many former employees, including flight attendants and customer-service agents who faced added obstacles because of their age, had never worked for another company.
They were fortunate, though, because Career Connections got off to a fast start. Rather than waiting until the airline failed, the Port Authority had applied for Federal funds and begun planning the job program several months earlier. The agency's planners knew that even under the company's most optimistic expectations, layoffs would be required.
 
Guidance for 2,200
 By moving before the company shut down on Dec. 4, 1991, Career Connections was able to open its doors less than six weeks later. Counselors, working six days a week, gave initial guidance to 2,200 people by the end of April.
Orientation sessions essentially allowed former workers to express their anger and commiserate with colleagues. The center also provided office space, telephone banks, fax machines, copying services, job fairs and open houses, a reference library, advice on preparing resumes and cover letters, and financial support for retraining. Most important, it offered a sanctuary.
"Going through the training kept me busy, compared to sitting back and thinking about how bad off I was," said Hans Pfeil, a former crew chief in the maintenance shop who was earning $19 an hour, or about $48,000 a year, when Pan Am collapsed. "It kept me out of trouble."
But in many ways both explicit and subtle, Pan Am's former employees were also reminded that their futures rested largely in their own hands. "It took a long time for many of these former employees to act on their own behalf," the final report on the program said.
One drawback of many job programs is that they do not demand enough of the participants, said Mr. Ryan, the head of the program.
"In the past, job programs didn't ask enough," he said. "You want people to feel comfortable coming for help, but in the end they have to shoulder the responsibility themselves."
So with the Pan Am programs, job search training was mandatory, because it forced most people to recognize that they would need to develop new skills to find work in a changing labor market. It also allowed them to express hostility in a safe haven and make mistakes before going on real job interviews.
Some never recovered from the shock of losing their jobs. Several gave up the search, often relying on spouses for income while waiting for their pensions to kick in at age 55.
Many were lucky to find work with other aviation companies. Roughly two out of five of those who found employment were hired within the industry, although some of those later lost their jobs again.
The rest, however, started over.
Mr. Pfeil, 57, had it harder than most. The day Pan Am folded, he was scheduled to fly to his mother's funeral in Germany. He had come to work that morning only to thank his supervisor for writing a letter so he could travel for free. "I never saw so many grown-up people cry," Mr. Pfeil said. "Myself, I didn't have any tears left."
Mr. Pfeil's challenge was to keep his house in Oceanside, L.I. "We cut back on everything else to pay the mortgage," he said. "When we tried to refinance, the bank we had relied on for years refused me three times. I finally found another bank that saved us $300 a month. I moved my I.R.A. to them."
Mr. Pfeil entered a training program to learn how to install and repair air-conditioning and heating systems. That led to a temporary job at $10 an hour, little more than half his previous income. When that ended, Home Depot hired him at roughly the same wage.
Along with more than 1,000 other people, Mr. Pfeil applied for a job to repair buses for the New York City Transit Authority. He was chosen and started work this winter. His pay and benefits are similar to what he earned before. Working a 4 P.M.-to-midnight shift, though, means he sees his family far less.
Still, Mr. Pfeil concluded, "I think I'm one of the lucky ones."
 
New Hope for Flight Attendant
 Helene Ladenheim, a former flight attendant who was 49 when Pan Am failed, has been less fortunate. Multilingual and with wide experience overseas, she initially hoped to continue her work.
"Delta promised to take 2,000 flight attendants," she said, "but they didn't have to follow seniority rules. My interview skills were not so good, and I didn't pass."
Eventually, after more than 20 job interviews, she decided to enter a two-year nurse training program. All except $1,000 of the cost was paid by the Federal grant. Ms. Ladenheim's experience taking care of people in the air, she says, should prove useful in her new career. And after caring for her husband, who died of cancer several years ago, she wants to help others in similar situations.
"I've spent a lot of time in hospitals and most of the doctors were pretty rotten and uncaring," she said. "It made me realize how important it is to have a good nurse."
Ms. Ladenheim, who graduated from nursing school last month, does not have a job yet, though she is hopeful. "The shortage of nurses is not as acute as it used to be," she said.
Mr. Wallace, 48, also wanted to stay in the aviation industry. Despite 24 years' experience as a mechanic, he was not senior enough in his shop to be chosen by Delta to work at its Atlanta operation.
"I had never really looked for a job," said Mr. Wallace, who joined Pan Am right after his military service. "Career Connections showed me how." For a while, he loaded baggage part-time for American Airlines. Finally, he found his current job working as a civilian handling evidence and property at the New York City Police Department auto pound in College Point. At $30,000 a year, it pays about $8,000 less than his old job.
And if the new job disappears?
"One thing I've learned is that I have other skills than being a mechanic," Mr. Wallace said. "So if it happens, it happens. Now I know I can survive the worst."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Fed Officials' Comments Help Push Rates Down

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Long-term interest rates moved lower again yesterday, brushing against the bottom of a trading range that has been in place since the beginning of April.
By late in the day, the Treasury's benchmark 6 1/4 percent bonds due in 2023 were offered at a price to yield 7.21 percent, down from 7.27 percent late Friday. It is the lowest yield on the closely watched issue since April 27. 
 Credit market participants attributed the improvement, which came on light trading, to several factors.
Comments from three governors of the Federal Reserve Board provided an initial lift to prices of fixed-income securities, traders said.
The governors were quoted in an article in The New York Times yesterday as saying that based on recent data they had concluded that growth in the economy had eased slightly, and that inflation was under control. Those developments made any further tightening in monetary policy much less likely in coming weeks, the article said.
Aside from the article, traders said the market was also benefiting from a light calendar of new Treasury issues that is scheduled. Periods of heavy supply are usually difficult times, because often prices must be marked down to attract customers. Dealing with new supply would not be a problem for at least the rest of the month, traders said.
 
 
European Markets
 Finally, a number of market participants said they saw investors repatriating money from European debt markets and moving it into the secondary market for Treasury securities. That movement also helped to bolster the dollar on foreign exchange markets.
Despite the extension of the rally, which began last Wednesday, analysts and traders were unwilling to say that an end to the upward movement in interest rates that began in early February is at hand.
"We have had several of these runs, from a top yield of around 7 1/2 percent to a low of around 7.20 percent," said Joseph Liro, chief economist at S. G. Warburg.
He added: "It feels good, but until we make a conclusive breakout this is still a trading range. I think long rates have a good chance of going back under 7 percent in the second half of the year, but the jury is still out."
Investors, as well as the Fed, will be busy sifting through various readings on the economy and inflation over the next several weeks to determine whether recent indications of a cooling are real, or merely an aberration.
"Right now the market is saying the Fed has finished tightening," one trader said. "But if we get strong numbers, we will start to price in additional tightening moves, and the market will get ugly all over again."
But all was calm yesterday, and a number of corporations took advantage of the good conditions to price new debt issues. The strong secondary Treasury market also provided a good backdrop for the Treasury's weekly bill auctions.
At the bill auctions, the Treasury sold its new three-month bills at an average discount rate of 4.15 percent, down from an average rate of 4.23 percent at last week's auction.
Bids on the new six-month bills generated an average discount rate of 4.53 percent, down from 4.67 percent a week ago.
The rates on the three-month and six-month bills are the lowest since the auctions of May 2.
Citicorp led corporate issuers yesterday, as it offered $250 million of 10-year subordinated notes through an underwriting syndicate led by Citicorp Securities Inc.
The notes, which are noncallable for life, were priced at par, or $100, to yield 7 3/4 percent -- 85 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 7.5 percent 10-year notes at the time of pricing.
The securities are rated A-3 by Moody's Investors Service and A- by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
Prices improved for all maturities in the secondary market for Treasury securities, although longer-dated bonds and notes outperformed intermediate and short-term issues.
By late in the day, the 7 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered at a price of 10215/32 , up 19/32 , to yield 6.90 percent. And the price of the Treasury's 6 3/4 percent five-year notes was up by 14/32 in late trading, to 1013/32 , to yield 6.48 percent.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of three-month and six-month Treasury bills:
 
 (000 omitted in dollar figures)

	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Average Price	98.951	97.710	Discounted Rate	4.15%	4.53%	Coupon Yield	4.25%	4.70%	High Price	98.954	97.715	Discounted Rate	4.14%	4.52%	Coupon Yield	4.24%	4.69%	Low Price	98.951	97.710	Discounted Rate	4.15%	4.53%	Coupon Yield	4.25%	4.70%	Accepted at low price	54%	86%	Total applied for	$49,769,321	$50,623,410	Accepted	$12,681,173	$12,649,419	Noncompetitive	$1,361,534	$1,161,733	
 
Both issues are dated June 9, 1994. The three-month bills mature on Sept. 8, 1994, and the six-month bills mature on Dec. 8, 1994.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
A New Day Dawns for South African Investment

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE 

 BODY:
Comforted by visions of Nelson Mandela visiting the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, institutional investors are beginning to look at the country they once shunned. But few are pulling out their checkbooks and, so far, the main business beneficiaries of South African political change have been large American companies whose stocks were once boycotted.
The big public pension funds that led the anti-apartheid charge are now free to invest in more than 100 of the largest United States corporations with ties to South Africa. In Michigan, for instance, the $24 billion state employees pension fund no longer faces a ban on more than 40 percent of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index -- including in-state giants like Ford Motor and General Motors.
 
'Fertile New Fields'
 Barry Stevens, the Michigan system's director of investments, said that the change "opens up fertile new fields" and that "before, we could just invest in teeny parts of the American market." 
 The $37 billion New Jersey state pension fund has just directed more than $500 million to a shopping list that includes General Electric, Du Pont, Time Warner and International Paper. And, in California, the $77 billion California Public Employees Retirement System has just begun to invest in 100 top American companies.
But these same public pension funds that supported economic sanctions are now reluctant to make risky bets about international markets, and little of their money is flowing into South African companies. At the same time, corporate pension plans that never expressed moral qualms about South Africa are showing interest in the Johannesburg exchange and have been seeking advice from stockbrokers and investment consultants.
"South Africa is in everybody's thoughts," said Stephen McCarthy, a portfolio manager at Batterymarch Financial Management. "It's a question of when it's going to start going."
Investors are worried, however, about political instability and potential violence, and that tends to slow the pace of investment. "Only the most sophisticated and adventurous investors will probably venture into South Africa," said Adam Spector, a director at the SEI Corporation, a Wayne, Pa., pension consulting firm.
That theme was echoed at a meeting last week in Atlanta, sponsored by the United States Information Agency, in which both United States business executives and South African officials agreed that the peaceful election and transition was the most important step in reassuring potential foreign investors. And South African officials repeated that business investment, not only buying stocks in South African companies but also setting up business operations there as well, was important to ending South Africa's high unemployment rates.
Allan A. Boesak, minister of economic affairs of the Western Cape provincial government, said: "The two questions are: How does one maintain the level of stability that we have been able to reach and how does the Government evolve as a partner of business from outside?
"You need the kind of investment that will create jobs on a scale large enough to allow for us to work actively at that incredible number of jobless people," Mr. Boesak said.
For stock pickers, the Johannesburg exchange, despite its size, is considered an emerging market and, as such, it competes for capital with fast-growing markets elsewhere. With more than 600 listed stocks, it has a market capitalization of $215 billion. It is the largest emerging market, bigger than those in Mexico, Malaysia, Taiwan, South Korea, China and all of Eastern Europe. Stocks linked to mining make up 30 percent of the exchange -- the best known being DeBeers Consolidated Mines Ltd. and Anglo American.
Investment capital is critical to development to help create jobs and support an educational system. Mr. Mandela, since calling in September for an end to economic sanctions, has expressed clear pro-business views. And African National Congress representatives in the United States have met with institutional investors to spread this message, while acknowledging investor concerns.
"We see that investors have adopted a wait-and-see attitude," said Madala Mthembu, a spokesman for the congress here. They are waiting, he acknowledged, "to see what the politics are and that the country stabilizes," adding, "That is what any sensible investor would do."
Since Mr. Mandela's September statement, a total of 137 state and local governments in the United States have eliminated pension fund restrictions on buying stock in American companies that did business, even tangentially, in South Africa. Forty-two others are in the process of repeal. While it is impossible to determine how much money was withheld, most came at the expense of the 100 or so largest American companies.
 
New Restrictions Replace Old
 But even as these restrictions fall, others remain. Roland Machold, director of investments for the New Jersey state fund, said state law prohibited investments in countries with less than an AA credit rating -- and South Africa is currently unrated.
Besides, global investing is still a new concept to some public plans, where there is a highly conservative investment focus. Such plans may not have tested established markets in Europe or Japan, let alone those in less familiar areas.
But Justin Beckett, president of New Africa Advisers, based in Durham, N.C., said such caution might be misplaced. South African stocks, he said, might well outpace domestic equities in the years ahead.
"If I'm a pension fund manager and I hear that the No. 1 performing stock market is in Johannesburg, I'd better have a good reason for not participating," Mr. Beckett said. He said that worries about social unrest were overblown and that the pre-election violence in South Africa had never affected business.
"No one took over the new Chrysler plant there or the Coca-Cola bottling plant," Mr. Beckett said. "You have riots in Los Angeles and political assassinations in Mexico and no one says to avoid investments there. You have record killings in New York and people don't avoid the New York Stock Exchange."
 
New Codes in the Works
 As investors ponder, the Rev. Leon H. Sullivan, the Philadelphia minister who devised the Sullivan Principles, a code of responsibility for American companies operating under apartheid, is now drafting a social responsibility code for companies that left South Africa and are returning.
In 1985, 267 American companies had South Africa operations. That fell to 104 in 1991 and rebounded this year to 154. Among those returning are Honeywell, I.B.M., Procter & Gamble and Sara Lee, which, with 4,703 employees, is the biggest American employer there.
One leading company returning to South Africa is the H. J. Heinz Company of Pittsburgh.
"We expect to have an investment there within 12 months," said Anthony J. F. O'Reilly, chief executive, at the Atlanta conference. "American business will adopt a quite unheroic pose and it will be one of wait-and-see. I think the omens are good. Many people will wait too long and it will be regrettable if they do."
Mr. Sullivan said he was concerned that "political apartheid is not replaced with economic apartheid" and that American companies act in a socially responsible way to protect equal rights, promote education and provide job training. To this end, he said, has been meeting with big-city mayors, heads of university endowments and black church leaders to persuade companies to sign on to his "new Sullivan Principles."
But the African National Congress fears that Mr. Sullivan's effort may duplicate what the South African Government plans on its own and impose burdens that could discourage foreign business from investing.
"We don't need a code of conduct for American investors and we are afraid it may become a disincentive," Mr. Mthembu of the A.N.C. said. "If he puts this on American companies, it will put them at a disadvantage to Japanese or British businesses. We will have our own laws protecting the employee. We wants business to act in a socially responsible manner. But it is not desirable to put this as a code of conduct."

HEADLINE: High Court to Rule on Bank Annuities Issue

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 6

 BODY:
The Supreme Court agreed today to resolve one of the most contentious issues in banking law -- whether federally regulated banks can sell annuities, an investment usually sold by insurance companies.
The case is an appeal by the Comptroller of the Currency, Eugene Ludwig, and Nationsbank of North Carolina that the Comptroller authorized in 1990 to act as a sales agent for a variety of annuities. In a ruling last year, the Federal appeals court in New Orleans invalidated, as contrary to Federal law, a 1985 decision by the Comptroller's office that selling annuities was appropriate for national banks as an activity "incidental" to the business of banking. 
 Banks' entry into the multibillion-dollar market for annuities, investments that are attractive to many customers as alternatives to low-interest certificates of deposit, has split the Federal courts and provoked a counterattack from the insurance industry. A lawsuit by a Houston-based insurance company, the Variable Annuity Life Insurance Company, resulted in this case.
Adding to the ferment over the issue, New York State bank regulators have permitted state-chartered banks to sell annuities in a decision that was upheld in March by the state's highest court. About half the banks in New York, including Chemical Bank, have state charters, while other leading banks, including Citibank and Chase Manhattan, are nationally chartered.
The American Bankers Association, the Conference of State Bank Supervisors and the New York Clearing House, representing 11 big commercial banks, all urged the Supreme Court to hear the case. The New York Clearing House said in its brief that the underlying question in the case was "the extent to which national banks may continue to respond to the needs of their customers in the rapidly changing marketplace for financial products."
The economic stakes in the outcome are considerable. In 1992, the last full year for which the Comptroller's office has statistics, banks sold annuities worth $12.2 billion, representing about 20 percent of the national market.
Annuities are similar to individual retirement accounts, which banks offer, because taxes on the interest earned can be deferred until the customer retires. But they are not subject to the $2,000 maximum annual contribution limit on I.R.A.'s.
There are several legal issues in the case, Nationsbank of North Carolina v. the Variable Annuity Life Insurance Company, No. 93-1612.
The first is the degree of deference that Federal courts owe to determinations of administrative agencies like the Comptroller of the Currency. The brief filed for the Comptroller by the Solicitor General, Drew S. Days 3d, argues that the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit failed to give proper deference to the agency's reasonable interpretation of its governing statutes.
 
'Business of Banking'
 Beyond the deference issue, the case involves two Federal banking laws. One, Section 24(7) of the National Bank Act of 1864, permits national banks to engage in activities that are "incidental" to the "business of banking." So one question in the case is whether the Comptroller correctly determined that the sale of annuities came within that grant of authority.
The other question is whether annuities are forms of insurance, as opposed to a noninsurance investment product. The issue is important because of another Federal law, Section 92 of the National Bank Act of 1916, which permits banks in towns of fewer than 5,000 inhabitants to sell a range of insurance products, whether or not they are incidental to banking. Lower courts have interpreted that grant of authority to small-town banks as prohibiting, by implication, other banks from selling insurance products.
In the Comptroller's view, annuities are not insurance at all because they lack the main characteristic of insurance, indemnification against the risk of loss. Annuities are investment contracts, the Comptroller ruled in adopting the challenged policy in 1985.
The appeals court in this case rejected that conclusion, noting that all 50 states regulate annuities under their insurance laws and that the Internal Revenue Code defines insurance companies, in part, as those that issue annuity contracts. The appeals court said that like life insurance, annuities were sold on the basis of actuarial calculations. People buy annuities, the court said, not to insure against the risk of dying prematurely but against the possibility of outliving their resources.

Selling by Japan's Exporters Thwarts Rally in the Dollar

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar was little changed against the Japanese yen and other leading currencies yesterday amid continuing signs that Japanese exporters were selling the dollar whenever it rallied.
Japanese exporters earn revenues in dollars and other currencies, which they must sell for yen to bring their profits back home. Japan's huge trade surplus with the United States means the country's manufacturers have a large stockpile of dollars to sell. 
 Yesterday, some Japanese exporters responded to Friday's rally in the dollar, which had pushed it to a two-month high, by selling dollars. Concerns about this selling kept the dollar from rising again, traders said.
"Exporters are putting a cap on the dollar's rally," said Joseph Francomano, a trader with Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank in New York. "A lot of them like selling at these levels."
The dollar was quoted late yesterday at 105.29 yen, little changed from 105.35 yen on Friday. The dollar eased a fraction to 1.6705 German marks from 1.6707 marks.
 
 
A Ceiling at 107 Yen
 "Many Japanese corporations don't expect the dollar to rise above 107 yen," said Koichi Takenaka, assistant vice president of the Industrial Bank of Japan. For that reason, he said, many are keen to sell dollars at current levels, while others are poised to sell at 105.50 yen to 106 yen.
The rally in the bond market helped the dollar gain last week by convincing many currency traders that international investors were again buying American financial assets.
Bonds rallied again yesterday amid signs that the the Federal Reserve was less likely to move on interest rates in the coming weeks since inflation appeared to be under control.
While stable American interest rates are good for bonds, they can hurt the dollar because German short-term interest rates are still as much as one percentage point higher, making deposits denominated in marks more attractive.
"If the Fed is on hold, the dollar loses one leg of support," said Marc Chandler, director of research at Ezra Zask Associates, a hedge fund with $180 million under management.
Other traders expect the dollar to fall against the yen if tensions between the United States and North Korea abate. The yen has recently been shaken by signs that North Korea is developing nuclear weapons. Investors often turn to the dollar in times of international crisis.
Elsewhere, the Canadian dollar rose to a two-month high against the United States dollar, buoyed by strong demand for Canadian bonds. The Canadian dollar rose to 72.86 United States cents, from 72.60 cents on Friday.

Pepsi and South Africa To Get Together Again

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS 

 BODY:
Pepsi-Cola International announced yesterday that it would return to South Africa, nine years after selling its beverage business there in response to international economic sanctions.
In a bid to compete against Coca-Cola, Pepsi has formed a joint bottling venture in which black investors from the United States hold a majority stake, according to the company. 
 "Our commitment is to create the most dynamic and most admired black-managed and black-owned company in South Africa," said Christopher A. Sinclair, president and chief executive of Pepsico Foods and Beverages International. In so doing, he added, Pepsi hopes to "differentiate ourselves from other companies and products."
The major competitor is Coke, which has a near-monopoly of the $1 billion South African beverage market.
"Coca-Cola is seen as part of the old South Africa," said Khehla S. Mthembu, chairman and chief executive of New Age Beverages Ltd., the local bottling joint venture with Pepsi.
 
Coke Disputes Statement
 Polly Howes, a spokeswoman for the Coca-Cola Company in Atlanta, said that Mr. Mthembu's statement was "a blatantly inaccurate portrayal of Coca-Cola in South Africa, obviously made by someone out of touch with the facts or who has a business bias."
She said that Coke sold its South African bottling operations to independent franchises in 1986. Blacks own a majority of one of the companies and two others are public companies in which blacks own stock, she said.
Ms. Howes said that Coca-Cola currently had no employees and no assets in South Africa. "At this point we are continuing to evaluate our options regarding re-entry," she said.
Pepsi-Cola International sold its company-owned bottling operation to a group that included black investors. The operation was later sold again and ceased operations.
In a telephone interview from Johannesburg, Mr. Mthembu, a 40-year-old native black South African, said that Pepsi "will involve black people in a process of empowerment, ranging from ownership and management to community support programs."
Mr. Mthembu said that "we are not going to sell our beverages purely because we are black," adding that the quality of Pepsi-Cola beverages and the qualifications of the management would be the best sales tools.
"This is a demanding business and we will run it professionally," he said. "But people here are calling for black ownership, and we do see New Age Beverages as being a part of that."
 
Revolutionary toTurned Businessman
 Mr. Mthembu described himself as "a former revolutionary" who once spent three years in prison with Nelson Mandela. He turned to the business world in 1986, "when we felt that liberation meant getting the economy in our hands," he said. For the last three years he was managing director of the African General Insurance Company Ltd., the largest black-owned insurance company in South Africa.
The president and chief operating officer of South Africa's Pepsi-Cola venture will be Monwabisi P. Fandeso, 35, a black South African engineer who held executive positions with South African Breweries and National Sorghum Breweries in South Africa.
Twenty-five percent of the Pepsi-Cola joint venture will be owned by Pepsi and 75 percent by Egoli Beverages L.P., a United States-based partnership incorporating black American investors. Egoli was formed by Ian R. Wilson, a white native of South Africa who was once an international manager for the Coca-Cola Company.
One of his partners will be Earl G. Graves, a black American who is chairman and chief executive of the Pepsi-Cola Bottling Company of Washington, and the publisher of Black Enterprise magazine.
New Age will produce and distribute a range of products, including Pepsi-Cola, Diet Pepsi, 7-Up and Mirinda orange beverage.
Initially the new plant, which will be in Johannesburg, will employ 100 to 200 South Africans and sell in the Transvaal province. Pepsico said said the initial sales effort at New Age would be about $100 million over three years.
Pepsi-Cola first entered South Africa in 1948 and when it suspended operations in 1985, it had a 25 percent share of the beverage market, according to Pepsico.

HEADLINE: U.S. IS SOFTENING STANCE IN TALKS ON JAPAN TRADE

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 6

 BODY:
Having learned in the last year that it did not have as much economic leverage over Japan as it thought, the Clinton Administration signaled today that it was ready to jettison its all-or-nothing, package-deal approach to a trade agreement with Japan and strike whatever arrangements it could get piece by piece.
The United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, first hinted at the change in remarks to reporters today, and he later elaborated in an interview. Since opening trade talks with Japan last July, the Administration has been pressing Tokyo for a package deal, known as a "framework," that would consist of agreements for opening five priority markets in Japan: automobiles, auto parts, insurance, medical equipment and telecommunications. 
 While the Administration never explicitly ruled out the possibility of accepting deals piece by piece, it has been negotiating them as a package from the start. In February, aides to President Clinton boasted that he could have struck a partial deal with Morihiro Hosokawa, who was Japan's Prime Minister at the time, covering only some of these areas, but that Mr. Clinton rejected that as insufficient.
Now American trade officials say that in the new negotiations, agreements to open Japanese markets in medical equipment, telecommunications equipment and insurance seem within reach, and may be ready for signing at the next summit meeting of the Group of Seven industrial countries, set for July 8-10 in Naples.
But, the officials said, the two nations remain sharply divided on how to open Japan's automobile and auto parts markets, and this crucial area will probably take much more time to resolve -- if ever. Two-thirds of the United States' $60 billion trade deficit with Japan comes from autos and auto parts.
In effect, the Administration's posture in the framework negotiations with Japan has gone from "all or nothing" to "take what you can get and deal with the rest later."
In a telephone interview from Paris, where he is participating in a meeting of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, Mr. Kantor said: "You have got to be realistic. We can't predict what is going to happen in every area. When you are ready to reach agreement on a particular sector, you should go ahead and finalize that and continue to move forward on the other areas.
 "We are not going to wait to open up everything until we make deals in all sectors. But -- let me be very clear -- we don't intend to stop with just one or two sectors either. We see the framework negotiations as a continuing process."
To show some progress, the Administration is now inclined to close whatever separate deals it can on insurance, telecommunications and medical equipment -- three sectors in which the Japanese Government either controls the market or is the biggest purchaser. It would also continue to negotiate for however long it takes on autos and auto parts; private companies and dealers dominate those Japanese markets and are reluctant to open them to foreigners.
Any market-opening agreements in telecommunications, insurance and medical equipment would undoubtedly benefit American exporters. But without a deal opening Japan's markets in autos and auto parts, these other agreements would probably have a small impact on the nations' huge trade imbalance.
With Mr. Clinton and Prime Minister Tsutomo Hata due to meet in July at the Group of Seven meeting, the Administration appears ready to accept at least a piecemeal deal so that the last year of negotiations will not appear to have been a total waste. Neither American nor Japanese officials want to go into another high-profile Group of Seven meeting with their trade stalemate still simmering, since that could only further roil the financial markets, push down the dollar's value and raise American interest rates.
Mr. Kantor's remarks were the latest in a series of subtle shifts in the Clinton Administration's trade policy toward Japan, as it has learned the hard way that it does not have as much clout with Tokyo as it initially thought and that it is going to have to adjust to that reality.
 The lessons the Administration has learned in the last year of dealing with Tokyo include these:
*Japan, which has had three Prime Ministers in the last 12 months, is going through a period of prolonged internal turmoil, which has left it without a political leadership with enough clout and credibility to strike the sort of far-reaching market-opening agreements that Mr. Clinton came into office demanding.
*Mr. Clinton's get-tough policy toward Japan may have played well on Main Street, but it bombed on Wall Street, where fears of a trade war helped to push down the value of the dollar, drive up American interest rates and generally unnerve the financial markets. The currency and bond markets reacted negatively to the get-tough approach, tying the Administration's hands and forcing it to lower its voice considerably when dealing with Tokyo.
*With the North Korea nuclear standoff heading into a crucial stage, the White House wants to have maximum cooperation with Tokyo, whose support is indispensable if any economic sanctions are to imposed on Pyongyang.
*Within the Clinton Administration, particularly the Treasury Department, there has long been a feeling that the different market-opening agreements the Administration has been seeking from Tokyo were a waste of time and energy. America's Asian and European allies did not support them; nor did the Japan's business community or its public.
What Washington should be focusing on instead, Treasury officials argued, is getting the Japanese Government to come up with a macro-economic stimulus program of tax cuts and Government spending that will spur consumer demand for imports from all sectors of the Japanese economy, be popular with the Japanese public and have the support of American allies from Asia to Europe.
 
 
A Striking Shift
 There is now a strong feeling in some quarters of the Clinton Administration that Washington should get as much as it can from Tokyo on the market-opening agreements, declare victory and focus in the future on the macro-economic side.
This is a striking shift. The framework that Washington and Tokyo agreed on in July for negotiating market-opening agreements stipulated the five areas that were not open to foreign competition as they should be.
In February, after eight months of inconclusive negotiations, the talks were aborted by President Clinton, even though aides told him at the time that they could probably obtain a partial deal covering some of the areas, like medical equipment, but not others, particularly autos and auto parts.
Late last month, the two sides agreed to resume talks after Tokyo explicitly accepted the American demand for numerical indicators and Washington specifically promised not to treat these numerical yardsticks as hard and fast import quotas.

HEADLINE: Albany to Expand Fingerprinting Plan For Welfare Funds

BYLINE: By IAN FISHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ALBANY, June 6

 BODY:
The Governor and legislative leaders have agreed to expand a contentious program for fingerprinting welfare recipients to a total of 12 counties. But top officials said today that the plan, part of an evolving deal on the state budget, excludes New York City, where two-thirds of the state's welfare recipients live.
Details of the fingerprinting program -- aimed at curbing welfare fraud -- emerged today as negotiators rushed to seal the final details of the roughly $34 billion state budget, which is now more than two months late. Though several important parts of the budget remained unsettled, the package includes more than $450 million in tax cuts, mostly to businesses, and is loaded with election-year spending projects across the state. 
 Although the Legislature is usually loath to increase its own budget in an election year, top officials in both houses said today that the agreement includes a modest increase in the $167 million budget spent on staff, supplies and other expenses. They would not disclose the amount of the increase. New York already has the most expensive legislature in the country.
And while state aid to schools and localities was expected to rise, officials in New York City complained that a bill passed by the Legislature today could open a gaping hole in the city budget.
City officials said they calculated the state budget would mean between $260 million and $300 million in increased state assistance for the city. Their complaint is that the bill would force the city to spend the aid on students rather than using it where the city decided the need was greatest; the officials said that could leave a $70 million gap in the city's budget.
Robert M. Harding, the city's lobbyist in Albany, said Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani would begin lobbying Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, who has not taken a position on the bill. "I'm sure we'll start expressing our reservations about this bill to the Governor's people," Mr. Harding said.
 
Assistance to Schools
 The Legislature voted today on two parts of a budget deal that officials said was all but complete: debt service and the $5.7 billion capital spending package. On Tuesday, the State Senate and the Assembly are expected to review other parts of the deal, including state assistance to schools and localities, and lawmakers were standing by in Albany to vote this week on the entire package, which was 67 days late today.
The deal on the fingerprinting program was among the most difficult to reach between the Senate and the Assembly, aides on both sides said. The Republican-controlled Senate, with Mr. Cuomo's support, was pushing for a statewide program, but the Democrats who control the Assembly argued that fingerprinting treats welfare recipients like criminals.
"It's merely a case of political posturing," said Mark A. Dunlea, executive director of Hunger Action Network of New York State, a coalition of soup kitchens and food pantries. "It sells well politically for them to say they are doing something about welfare fraud."
The final deal, scheduled to go before rank-and-file legislators on Tuesday, calls for the program to be expanded in October to 12 counties, including Rockland and Onongada Counties, which were already part of a pilot fingerprinting program. The program would cost roughly $2 million and would be run by each county.
The other counties are Suffolk, Orange, Oneida, Broome, Rensselaer, Niagara, Allegany, Steuben, Dutchess and Oswego. But the program does not include the five counties in New York City, where the greatest number of the state's welfare recipients live and where some advocates of the plan say it would be most useful, in part because there are so many welfare offices.
"We feel finger imaging is a very good way of saving money and we would explore means of doing that," said Cristyne Lategano, press secretary for Mr. Giuliani, who has said he may go forward with the program even without state approval. Thomas S. Gulotta, the Nassau County Executive, has also expressed interest in starting a fingerprinting program.
 
Potential Legal Problem
 But there is a potential legal problem if Mr. Giuliani or other county leaders not in the program decide to initiate fingerprinting.
Opponents contend that fingerprinting amounts to another criterion for welfare, like income, and that the Legislature alone can decide on the criteria. Others argue that a fingerprint is the equivalent of a photograph on a driver's license and does not need legislative approval.
Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat who has opposed fingerprinting, said his chamber agreed to the expansion as a larger, more complete extension of the tests in Rockland and Onondaga Counties, where he said the programs were flawed and did not catch a single welfare cheat. The counties did save money under the program because fewer people applied for benefits, but it was inconclusive whether the fingerprinting was the reason.
 
Cost of Technology
 Mr. Silver said he argued against including New York City in the program because the technology would cost too much for the program he said was untested.
Under the agreement, the program would expire in two years and would be evaluated in an independent study.
The technology for fingerprinting includes an optical scanner tethered to a data bank that can compare a fresh set of prints to thousands of others on file in a matter of minutes. There is no ink: the computer electronically converts a print into a mathematical formula.
Aides said that to appease the Senate, which wanted a more comprehensive program, the deal includes more than $250,000 for enhanced prosecution of welfare cheats in five counties, including New York County (Manhattan), Queens County and Niagara County.
Unlike in past years, the Governor and lawmakers this year have not announced a formal budget deal, and the Legislature is acting on various parts of the budget as negotiations are completed. On Sunday, rank-and-file lawmakers reviewed the capital budget and a tax cut package, which calls for more than $450 million in tax cuts. Those cuts include the phasing out of the surcharge on corporate income taxes, repeal of the state's portion of a tax on luxury hotel rooms and a tax credit for low-income working families.
Senator George E. Pataki, the Republican designee for Governor, said today that he would vote against "the vast majority" of the package, including the tax cuts, and blamed Mr. Cuomo for overspending, though Mr. Pataki's boss in the Senate, the majority leader, Ralph J. Marino, Republican of Oyster Bay, is one of the three architects of the deal.
"It looks like we are going to be spending more than $4 billion more than last year," said Mr. Pataki, who has voted against every budget during his 10 years in the Assembly and Senate. "We continue to spend and tax ourselves into economic uncompetitiveness."
 
Clash With Giuliani
 The fight over aid to New York City schools was in many ways a tangle between Mr. Giuliani and Assembly Democrats, who represent mostly minority neighborhoods and have been upset about the Mayor's cuts in the city budget. The bill passed today requires that the state's five largest cities maintain a steady level of local financing for schools so that the cities cannot use increases in state education aid to offset budget deficits.
Two of Mr. Cuomo's pet projects were scaled down in budget negotiations. A scholarship program for poor college students, for which he had requested $70 million, will be delayed for a year, though $50 million will be set aside for the program for this year's budget. Also, a high school for exceptional math and science students in Albany will be developed without a dormitory, to save $10 million on the $15 million project.
The deal includes repeal of the last tolls on state roads, the 25-cent fees on the Hutchinson and Saw Mill River Parkways, as of Oct. 31. For at least the next eight years, the state will pay for the Westchester County police to continue patrolling the highways.

HEADLINE: Intractable Pain Of Sickle Cell Begins to Yield

BYLINE: By WARREN E. LEARY 

 BODY:
THE pain is like no other, its sufferers say, deep, gnawing agony that goes to the bone. Those who have experienced other conditions known for their measure of pain, like cancer, childbirth, arthritis and surgery, almost always say none compares with the torment of sickle cell disease.
The pain of sickle cell is not only intractable but in many cases lifelong. And while many people have heard that the condition is associated with acute suffering, experts say, few have a sense of how bad it can be. 
 Sickle cell disease is an inherited blood disorder that afflicts millions worldwide and tens of thousands in the United States, where it usually takes the form of sickle cell anemia, with varying degrees of severity.
Specialists say pain in general, and sickle cell pain in particular, is not being treated adequately. Concern about unnecessary patient suffering resulted in recent Federal guidelines on treating surgical and cancer pain. Experts say there has also been growing interest in the pain of sickle cell, in part because it takes a unique form and in part because of the increasing realization that most doctors do not know how to deal with it.
"There is not one kind of sickle cell pain, and it can't be treated as such," said Dr. Lennette J. Benjamin, a leading sickle cell pain researcher who is co-director of the Sickle Cell Center at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx. "Many of the standard approaches to treating pain do not work well with sickle cell disease. You can't apply any treatment universally to all sickle cell patients."
Sickle cell pain combines chronic suffering with acute, severe attacks, called crises. If not properly treated, experts say, this combined pain causes a buildup of toxic substances that further injure cells, Dr. Benjamin said, causing more pain and inflammation in a cascading action.
While other types of chronic pain, like that associated with rheumatoid arthritis, can last for years, few are coupled with recurring acute episodes, Dr. Benjamin said, and few begin as early as infancy and last for life, as sickle cell pain can.
Not all those with sickle cell disease suffer equally. Studies indicate that more than 50 percent of patients experience significant acute or chronic pain, while nearly 40 percent rarely or never have such episodes. About 20 percent of patients account for 80 percent of hospitalizations for acute painful episodes.
Researchers have recently reported a number of new approaches to treating sickle cell pain, including using high doses of inflammation-fighting steroid drugs and applying epidural injections of local anesthetics into the lower spine, a method also used to control the pain of labor.
 
It Starts With Hemoglobin
 With sickle cell disease, the body produces abnormal forms of hemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen throughout the body. Stress, temperature changes and other factors that are not well understood somehow cause cells containing this hemoglobin to stiffen and distort into odd, prickly shapes, which can clog small blood vessels. These painful occlusions can lead to stroke, damage to bones and internal organs and life-threatening infections.
Dr. George R. Buchanan of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, who has treated sickle cell patients for more than 20 years, noticed that pain crises include swelling, redness, warmness to the touch and increased white blood cell counts -- typical of an inflammatory response. Exploiting this idea, Dr. Buchanan, Dr. Timothy C. Griffin and others treated 36 children and adolescents undergoing 56 acute pain episodes with doses of a corticosteroid, methylprednisolone, or a placebo.
The researchers found that two doses of the steroid 24 hours apart caused a rapid reduction in pain in several patients and generally shortened hospital stays by a third, although a small number of the children suffered rebound bouts of pain within days after initial improvement. The results, published recently in The New England Journal of Medicine, were encouraging enough for Dr. Buchanan to begin a new study with another steroid, dexamethasone, given in four doses over a 48-hour period. Dr. Buchanan said he hoped this would produce similar positive results without the rebound problem.
In another study, Dr. Myron Yaster and his colleagues at the Pediatric Pain Service at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore found that children who did not respond well to conventional pain therapy during sickle cell crises recovered faster and reported little pain after getting spinal anesthetics. Dr. Yaster said his group has found these epidurals using local anesthetics, like lidocaine, give better relief for almost all kinds of pain than intravenous infusions of narcotics.
 
Relief in 15 Minutes
 In the first application of this technique to sickle cell disease, the researchers said in a report in the February issue of Pediatrics, eight of nine children in severe pain from the chest down reported dramatic relief within 15 minutes of starting the treatment, which took an average of three days.
"Of all the pains we see, the hardest to manage is sickle cell crisis pain," Dr. Yaster said. "So, we are encouraged by these results and have submitted a grant application to study using this technique as first-line therapy."
Sickle cell anemia is most prominent in Africa, but varies widely in incidence throughout the continent. The genetic predisposition toward the disease varies from about 7 percent to 25 percent in West Africa, for example, compared with about 8 percent among black Americans, said Dr. James E. Bowman of the University of Chicago, an expert in the worldwide epidemiology of the disease. Experts say 1 of every 375 to 400 black Americans, more than 60,000 people, is afflicted with sickle cell anemia at birth.
In addition, sickle cell anemia is found in some whites whose ancestors came from the Mediterranean area, as well as among people in India, the Middle East, the Caribbean and Central and South America. The genetic mutations that cause sickle cell arose in many places where malaria was prominent, including the southern Mediterranean and India, because sickle cell disease has a protective effect against malaria, Dr. Bowman said.
Sickle cell patients around the world describe the pain in similar terms. Dr. Barbara S. Shapiro, a specialist at Children's Hospital in Philadelphia, noted that many African tribal names for the disease translate variously as "body chewing" or "body biting," or in the case of "nwiiwii," in the language of the Fanti tribe of Ghana, imitate the screams and moans of victims.
"The thing about sickle cell pain is that it is intense and you never know when it will occur," said Dr. Dorothy C. Moore, a physician and pathologist who has sickle cell disease. "I had my most severe painful episodes when I was younger, but it has evolved into a chronic type of pain that I have just about all the time. It's similar to acute arthritis, but instead of just my joints hurting, the whole bone itself hurts."
 
'A Pulsating Pain'

 
 Dr. Moore, who is 42 and an associate professor of laboratory medicine at the New Jersey College of Medicine in Newark, said she still has acute pain episodes several times a year, mostly involving her lower legs and back. But they occur less frequently than they did in her youth and last only one or two days, instead of five.
"For me, it's a pulsating pain, hard in intensity, that usually occurs in the same spots," she said. "When I feel it coming on, I try to engross myself in my work and ward it off. I don't always succeed."
There is no cure for sickle cell disease, but a few experimental treatments, including the use of drugs like hydroxyurea and butyrate to stimulate production of more beneficial forms of hemoglobin, are beginning to offer the first hopes of attacking the underlying cause of the illness. Most current treatments, like giving patients intravenous fluids, blood transfusions and pain killers, are aimed at relieving symptoms of the disease.
Deaths from sickle cell disease have decreased greatly in the last 20 years, primarily because of early diagnosis and better control over infections that previously killed so many patients, experts said. The vast majority of patients now survive into adulthood and those in their 50's and 60's are becoming common, they said. But older patients develop chronic pain that can damage organs and bones and lead to secondary arthritis.
Dr. Clarice Reid, chief of the Sickle Cell Disease Branch of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, said studies show pain not only affects quality of life, but mortality itself. A 1991 study of more than 3,500 sickle cell patients treated at 23 medical centers pointed out the pain-mortality link, she said. It found that among those with sickle cell who were more than 20 years old, people with high rates of pain episodes -- averaging three or more a year -- tended to die earlier than those with low rates.
"Pain is not just a subjective part of the disease," Dr. Reid said. "It has implications for longevity."
 
Obstacles to Treatment

 
 Part of the problem in dealing with sickle cell pain is societal. Dr. Elliot P. Vichinsky, chief of hemotology-oncology and director of the Sickle Cell Center at Oakland Children's Hospital in Oakland, Calif., said, "Many sickle cell patients do not get good care, both because their pain is not understood and because of social factors, like ethnic bias and economic issues."
Many doctors who see sickle cell pain in emergency rooms or clinics do not understand it because the source of the pain is not always obvious, and most physicians are not trained to deal with severe pain, Dr. Vichinsky said. And since almost all of the patients are black and many are from disadvantaged backgrounds, he said, some doctors without sickle cell experience may suspect that the patient is just trying to get narcotic pain killers to abuse.
"Even when sickle cell disease is diagnosed and doctors know the pain is real, many patients do not get good treatment because there is no simple way to handle it," Dr. Vichinsky said. "Sickle cell patients need an aggressive, multi-disciplinary approach to treatment, but they are often shunted aside to hemotologists outside of major centers who are not geared to take care of them."

HEADLINE: In Budapest, Signs Of a Literary Life After Communism

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BUDAPEST, June 6

 BODY:
The Budapest Book Week used to be a worthy event, where Hungary's state-run publishing houses dutifully released art volumes, comradely fiction from the Warsaw Pact countries and, in the 1980's, a smattering of Western titles. Then, after the collapse of Communism, the literary fireworks that everyone anticipated failed to materialize and publishing, afflicted by economic hardship, went into the doldrums.
But at the 65th annual fair, held here last week on graceful Vorosmarty Square in the center of the city, a fresh spirit seemed to dominate, suggesting that new writing was at last emerging in Eastern Europe after a five-year dry spell. 
 Amid the 41 booths, privately owned publishers with lists of contemporary Hungarian writers did brisk business. Some of the state-run publishers offered current fiction alongside their usual fare of picture books. And there was lively interest in the Hungarian translation of "Under the Frog," by Tibor Fischer, a 35-year-old British writer born of Hungarian parents.
"Under the Frog," a comic novel set in Hungary between World War II and the 1956 uprising, was a finalist for Britain's Booker Prize last fall. The novel, published here by Europa, a privatized state firm, has just been released in the United States by the New Press.
 
Period of Despair
 "There was a despair for one or two years after 1989, when writers were submerged in politics every day," said George Bolgar, the new director of Helikon, a venerable Hungarian publishing house that has been losing money but hopes to change this by presenting new writing. "But the best of them have raised the level of writing about contemporary politics. Peter Esterhazy has written articles in daily papers that can be considered as literature but with reference to day-to-day politics."
Mr. Esterhazy, one of only a few contemporary Hungarian writers whose work is translated into English, had a new collection at the fair: "Egy Kekharisnya Feljegyzesey," roughly translated as "Notes From an Intelligent Whore." The pieces, which are both literary and political, make reference to the characters and policies of the right-of-center Government that was elected in Hungary in 1990 and was defeated in elections last month.
Mr. Bolgar, a well-known radio journalist before he joined Helikon recently, said the theme of how a Communist society transforms itself was a compelling one. "To describe how a society collapsed and this new something emerged, and how people lived through this, that is the most intriguing," he said.
Despite the impression in the West that Eastern Europe is making the transition from Communism without much difficulty, the new writing here strikes an opposite and rather mordant chord. Mr. Bolgar, for example, rushed out a collection of pieces by Tivadar Farkashazy, whom he described as a cross between the American columnists Art Buchwald and Dave Barry. Mr. Farkashazy's "I Don't Understand" is a sort of "grotesque chronicle" of the last four years, Mr. Bolgar said.
 
A House Making a Profit
 Abovo, a new publishing house founded in 1991 by Miklos Vamos, a novelist and dramatist, has issued 28 novels and 2 nonfiction books in inexpensive editions designed to sell in the hard economic times. With a Budapest restaurant guide in Hungarian ("Foglatjon Helyet" or "Have a Seat") that has become a solid seller, and with low overhead, the company is making a profit, Mr. Vamos said.
"I hope the big publishing houses go bankrupt as soon as possible," said Mr. Vamos, who helped organize this year's fair and perked it up with outdoor music performances and events for children. "The state grants go to publishers who are the favorite children of the Government. The next Government won't like me because I won't support them either."
His house has made contracts with four highly regarded Hungarian writers: Gyorgy G. Kardos, Gyorgy Spiro, Akos Kertesz and Judit Fenakel.
For the fair, Abovo released a new collection of short stories by Mr. Spiro, the title of which is a play on words that can be roughly translated as "Horroar". These stories are about the "madness" of the last four years, the publisher said. Abovo has also published "Reflections," a first novel by a 30-year-old writer, Zsuzsa Kapecz; it is an abstract tale set in the Hungarian countryside (although the book never specifically mentions Hungary), with thinly veiled characters from the political scene of the last four years.
 
Misjudging of Demand?

 
 One problem for Hungarian writers, whose language is one of the most inaccessible in Europe, is a general lack of translation for Western markets. Hungarian publishers say this is because of a lack of interest. "Usually, Americans just want one author from a country like ours," said Mr. Vamos. The fact that there are two such writers from Hungary, George Konrad and Peter Esterhazy, "makes me very proud," he said.
But Tony Lang, the owner of Bestsellers, an English-language bookshop in Budapest, believes Hungarians are underestimating the demand for English translations of Hungarian literature.
"The publishers here haven't understood how much they can sell of the English version of a Hungarian book," said Mr. Lang, whose store offers a wider range of current American and British books than any other store in Eastern Europe and who recently held a book signing for Mr. Fischer with "Under the Frog."
"There are several thousand English-speaking people here who are always asking for Hungarian books in English," said Mr. Lang. "As well, the publishers could exploit the audience in the United States who are second- and third-generation Hungarians who would prefer to read their Hungarian literature in English. But that takes effort."
Mr. Lang, pointing to a sign of interest in Hungarian writing, said he gets at least five people a day inquiring about English translations of Hungarian poets. So far, he has not been able to come up with a good anthology in English. As for novels by some of Hungary's other established literary writers -- Gyula Krudy, Miklos Meszoly and Ivan Mandy, for instance -- there is nothing in English, Mr. Lang said. "It is a neglected opportunity."

HEADLINE: U.S. Steps Up North Korea Talks And Drafts an Embargo Plan

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, June 6

 BODY:
The United States intensified consultations here today, seeking to build a coalition in favor of punitive action against North Korea if it continues to defy United Nations nuclear inspectors.
American officials said the United States had drafted a proposed resolution for an economic embargo but had not yet shown the text to other countries. 
 The United States representative, Madeleine K. Albright, met with the South Korean Foreign Minister, Han Sung Joo, and had separate meetings with the representatives of Japan and China. She then met with the four countries that along with the United States are permanent members of the Security Council -- Britain, China, France and Russia. Each permanent member has the power to veto Council decisions.
 
Assistant Secretary Attends
 Also on hand for these meetings was Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gallucci. He has led the unsuccessful American campaign to persuade North Korea to meet its obligations under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty in return for an end to its diplomatic isolation, including better relations with the United States.
After meeting with this month's Council President, Salim bin-Mohammed al-Khussaiby of Oman, Foreign Minister Han indicated that South Korea supported the threat of sanctions against the North, describing a trade embargo as "the most important option we are discussing."
Mr. Han also expressed optimism about China's attitude, despite Beijing's professed opposition to sanctions in the past, saying, "I don't expect China to be standing in the way of trying to solve this issue."
In Washington, the State Department announced that its third-ranking official, Peter Tarnoff, the Under Secretary for Political Affairs, would go to Japan and South Korea this week for further talks with the leaders of those countries.
 
'Corrective Action' Sought
 American officials said the Clinton Administration's immediate goals were first to encourage "corrective action" by North Korea that would allow inspectors of the International Atomic Energy Agency to reconstruct as much as possible of the history of the reactor at its nuclear site at Yongbyon.
The second objective is to prevent any further deterioration in the situation there that would make it harder to discover whether North Korea had secretly removed nuclear explosive from the reactor when it was shut down for a hundred days in 1989.
On Friday, the director of the agency, Hans Blix, told the Security Council that North Korea had dismantled so much of the reactor's core, despite agency protests, that it was impossible for inspectors to tell whether plutonium had been covertly reprocessed from removed fuel rods.
The agency has already established that North Korea secretly manufactured some plutonium in violation of its safeguards agreement with the agency, although it is not known how much.
An agency request to examine two nuclear waste dumps that might throw light on this question was rejected.
When the Security Council has imposed trade sanctions in the past, as it has on Iraq, Yugoslavia and Haiti, the Council has first issued a warning, setting a deadline for compliance with its orders before the embargo goes into force.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Warning From the North
 SEOUL, South Korea, June 6 (Special to The New York Times) -- In one of its most strident and ominous warnings that it would not submit to pressure from the United Nations, North Korea said today that "sanctions mean outright war."
The statement, which was combined with an unusually specific threat against the President of South Korea, Kim Young Sam, was issued by the Committee for Peaceful Unification of the Fatherland, the group in the North Korean Government that oversees inter-Korea affairs.
A North Korean broadcast said that if "Kim Young Sam dares to move toward the road of adventure, this will mean his end."
While American and South Korean officials have grown somewhat inured to North Korea's often-inflated language, the comments today clearly prompted concern, and there were small signs of increased military readiness here. The South Korean Prime Minister, Lee Young Dug, said after a meeting of the heads of various security agencies that "now is the time to prepare the people for a series of contingency steps."
Prime Minister Lee also declared a crackdown on radical students who have supported North Korea, saying the Government would not tolerate "forces trying to wreck our free democratic system."
So far the North appears not to have responded to several openings created by President Clinton, who said over the weekend that he thought a diplomatic solution was still possible if additional North Korean sites were opened to inspectors.

HEADLINE: It's Your Money or Strife in Zaire, Where Corruption Reigns

BYLINE: By JOHN DARNTON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: KINSHASA, Zaire

 BODY:
Traveler to Zaire, beware!
Stepping off the sweltering tarmac at Ndjili, the new arrival becomes a helpless fish in a sea of sharks. 
 Snap! The passport disappears, perhaps taken by the man with some kind of emblem fastened to his lapel by a paper clip. Snip! The luggage goes off in two directions.
The visitor is led into a darkened office for interrogation. The passport magically reappears. But there are problems: Something strange about the visa, perhaps. An ulterior motive for your visit? The questions swirl into a crescendo of accusations.
But perhaps all this can be overlooked. A $50 bill on the table is scooped up like raw bait.
More money is required to locate the suitcases and get through customs and then to pay off the touts and soldiers who cram into the taxi peeling off toward the capital.
The departure is worse, for now the visitor has been here long enough to commit certain offenses. Smuggling? Black market trading? Spying? The interrogation can last an hour or more. It slows to an impasse as the flight is being announced.
The extortion of money from visitors by officials who receive no regular pay is only the most superficial manifestation of a malady that runs deep in Zaire and some other African countries. Corruption is a constant source of conversation, but it is never mentioned in studies by the World Bank or the United Nations.
Unlike eruptions of scandals in, say, Italy or Japan, the corruption here never erupts; it is a constant, diplomats, scholars and Africans themselves say. It runs up and down through the entire country, from the soldier in sunglasses who flags down a motorist to extract a bribe for an imaginary infraction to President Mobutu Sese Seko, who has become one of the world's richest men by plundering Zaire's treasury.
"This isn't just greasing the wheels so that the pie keeps growing. It's an impediment to growth, pure and simple," said an American State Department official.
The gross national product of almost all countries south of the Sahara has been in a decline for over a decade, and while there are many reasons for this, corruption and economic mismanagement rank high among them.
Nigeria, gushing with oil and go-for-broke capitalism, is widely deemed to be the most corrupt country in West Africa. Beginning in the early 1970's -- when 20 million tons of cement was ordered in a kickback scheme that clogged the harbor with sinking freighters -- generations of leaders have enriched themselves.
The Economist magazine estimated in April that about $3 billion -- or 10 percent of the gross domestic product -- "disappeared" out of Nigeria's public accounts in 1992.
If Nigeria is the king of "dash" in West Africa, Zaire is the undisputed champion in central Africa. "Everything is for sale -- anything can be bought in our country," Mr. Mobutu once said.
One former Foreign Minister, Nguza Karl-I-Bond -- who was sentenced to death for treason and fled into exile and is inexplicably back working as a deputy defense minister -- testified in Washington in the 1970's that Mr. Mobutu had stashed away $5 billion.
One Western diplomat said he thinks the president "operates more like a franchise system -- he'll give you the exclusive right to import chickens from Europe or to sell fish to the army or to operate cellular telephones."
Not long ago, Telecel, a largely American-owned company, was granted an exclusive contract to operate a cellular phone system. Then another outfit mysteriously appeared, owned by the son of Bemba Saolona, one of Mr. Mobutu's closest associates. Telecel cables were cut. Then a microwave appeared on a nearby building, jamming its antenna. Local papers call it the "battle of the frequencies," but nobody doubts who is going to win.

HEADLINE: Stocks Rise on Fed News, Then Slip

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
For much of yesterday, the stock market rallied as a report that the Federal Reserve Board was unlikely to raise interest rates in the next few weeks sent bond prices higher.
But by the afternoon, stock traders were selling their suddenly more valuable shares as they took profits after having little to show in the trendless market of the last few weeks. The major indexes closed mixed and barely changed. 
 Blue chips like Chevron, General Motors and Sears, Roebuck, as well as health care companies like Abbott Laboratories and oil companies like Mobil all fell. But over-the-counter stocks like Microsoft and US Health Care held on to their gains.
The selling was accelerated late in the day as some computer-guided trading kicked in. Starting at 3:30 P.M., the Dow Jones industrial average fell nearly 22 points while the Standard & Poor's 500, starting at 3:15 P.M., fell nearly 3 points.
By the closing gavel, the Dow settled at 3,768.52, down 3.70 points, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500 settled at 458.88, down 1.25 points.
Of the major indexes, only the smaller-company Nasdaq composite index kept some gains. In the last half- hour of trading, the Nasdaq fell more than a point, but closed up 1.05 points, to 743.43.
Even a sharp drop in the Commodity Research Bureau index, a proxy for commodities traders' inflation outlook, failed to sustain the rally. It fell 3.21 points, to 228.84, one of the steepest drops this year. Abundant rain in the Midwest over the weekend helped bring down the price of futures contracts for soybeans and related products.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, the number of shares changing hands yesterday remained below average as it has since May 17, when the Fed raised interest rates for the fourth time this year. Trading volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled only 259.1 million shares, some 14 percent below this year's average of 300 million shares.
 
Traders Spend Time on Sidelines
 Although Monday is often a below-average day, stock traders have spent a great deal of time on the sidelines in the last few weeks wondering whether the Fed would raise rates soon or hold off consideration of tighter monetary policy until autumn.
Yesterday, The New York Times reported that three of the five sitting Fed governors contend that inflation is under control and that another interest-rate increase unnecessary for now. The Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee, on which the seven Fed governors serve along with the presidents of five of the 12 the regional Federal Reserve Banks, will meet next month to decide the next move on interest rates. There are two vacancies on the Federal Reserve Board at the moment.
Long-term interest rates, a proxy for bond traders' inflation outlook, fell. The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 17/32 , to 888/32 . Its yield, the interest rate a current bond needs to pay to coax new buyers, fell to 7.21 percent from 7.27 percent. Since May 31, in five trading sessions, the bond's yield has fallen 22 basis points. A basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 0.17 point, to 254.17, with advancing stocks outnumbering declining stocks 1,320 to 864. The American Stock Exchange market value index rose 0.75 point, to 442.59.
Of the 30 component stocks that make up the Dow industrials, 17 fell, led by Chevron, which fell 1 point, to 87 3/4, following news of cost overruns at a huge Canadian offshore oil project now being built. Chevron is a part-owner of the project.
Of the 500 component stocks that make up the S.& P. 500, 220 fell, led by Pepsico, which fell 1 3/8, to 34 5/8. A Goldman, Sachs analyst reduced his assessment of Pepsico, but continued to recommend the stock, citing slower-than-expected growth at Taco Bell and other Pepsico restaurants.
Even the most active stock was not all that active. At 4.8 million shares, the most heavily traded stock was Microsoft, which rose 1 5/8, to 54 1/2. It was unclear what news might have affected the stock. The most immediate news was that The Wall Street Journal reported that Justice Department investigators were interviewing Microsoft executives as part of an antitrust investigation.

CORRECTION-DATE: June 8, 1994, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day yesterday about stock market activity on Monday misstated the trading volume of the Microsoft Corporation's shares. A total of 47.8 million Microsoft shares were traded, not 4.8 million shares.

HEADLINE: Stop Benefits for Aliens? It Wouldn't Be That Easy

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: HOUSTON, June 7

 BODY:
On a sultry day in July, a 25-year-old woman, Laura C., waded across the Rio Grande, slipped past the Border Patrol in Brownsville, Tex., and boarded a $49 Southwest Airlines flight to Houston.
Hoping for work and a better life, she has instead subsisted on government benefits and become one more straw threatening to break the back of America's uneasy patience with illegal immigrants. 
 With at least four million illegal aliens in the country, politicians from Florida to California have introduced dozens of bills to stop giving them services like education to health care.
Laura C., the unmarried mother of two children with a third on the way when she arrived, reached Houston with no English and no plan beyond her sister's assurance that she could find house-cleaning jobs at $40 a day.
"I had never heard of food stamps; I had never heard of W.I.C.," Laura said, naming the two Federal programs that put $46.50 worth of food on her family's table each week. (She did not want her last name used for fear of being found and deported.)
Most of the benefits are available because Laura's baby boy, Jacobo, born at public expense at Ben Taub General Hospital here five months ago, is an American citizen.
Illegal immigrants are not always a drain on the American economy. Many pay more in direct and indirect taxes than they get in government services. But Laura and her children epitomize the immigrants who angry taxpayers say come here in violation of American law and live off the American safety net.
Nevertheless, it would be extremely difficult, and perhaps even legally impossible, to reduce aid to illegal immigrants significantly. Public schools would have to turn away children, and hospitals would have to refuse treatment to accident victims and pregnant women. Education and emergency medical care represent at least two-thirds of the estimated $7 billion spent each year by all levels of government on illegal immigrants, according to the Center for Immigration Studies, a research group in Washington.
But longstanding Federal and state laws and court rulings require hospitals to provide emergency care for anyone, regardless of immigration status, and the Supreme Court ruled in 1982 that any child on American soil has the right to an education.
Barring catastrophic illness, by far the single largest cost that Laura's family will pose to taxpayers is the education of her three children: Jesus, 5 years old, who registered for kindergarten last week; Nicole, who turns 3 in a few days, and Jacobo.
The Federal, state and local governments pay an average of $4,683 a year for a student in Houston. If Laura's three children go through high school, the bill would come to more than $182,000 in today's dollars.
Nationwide, the cost of educating illegal immigrants is estimated to be at least $3 billion a year -- and $4.5 billion when the American-born children of illegal immigrants are included.
As for health care, many proposals to cut aid would do little more than transfer to local governments the obligations that have been assumed by Federal programs, like Medicaid, which helped to pay for Jacobo's delivery in January.
Welfare, by contrast, is largely unavailable to illegal immigrants, a vast majority of whom work and pay some taxes. Only a small minority receive benefits, generally through relatives who are American citizens.
Laura does not qualify for Aid for Families With Dependent Children, the welfare program that provides cash to recipients. But for now, she and her daughter, Nicole, qualify for $12 a week in food coupons from the Women, Infants and Children program, a supplemental Federal benefit for nursing mothers, who are eligible regardless of citizenship, and for children under 5. Jacobo qualifies for another $8 a week under this program.
Any long-term benefits are likely to come through Jacobo, whose rights to welfare are the same as those of any native-born American.
Politicians who favor deep reductions in all types of aid to illegal immigrants hope to change the rules. Some, like Gov. Pete Wilson of California, have called for a constitutional amendment to take away citizenship rights from the American-born children of illegal aliens. A California ballot initiative would bar illegal immigrants from schools. If approved, the measure is certain to face legal challenges.
There has generally been less pressure for such aggressive action in other parts of the country -- even in places like New York and Texas, which both have large populations of illegal immigrants.
Proponents of the changes say they would discourage people like Laura C. from entering the country. But many experts, and immigrants themselves, say curtailed services would not deter people, because their primary goal is to find a job.
"For those who have come to work -- and believe me, that is most -- it won't matter if you cut the benefits," Laura said. "There may be problems when they come here, they may find work or they may not. Maybe the work will not pay as much as they thought. But they'll come anyway."
Supporters of a crackdown counter that even if the cutoff fails to stem the tide, it is outrageous for taxpayers to bear any burden for those who have entered the country illegally.
"An illegal alien dilutes in part or altogether the legal rights and privileges of a legal citizen," said Representative Lamar Smith of Texas, the chairman of the House Republican Task Force on Immigration.
But many experts warn that unless the measures being proposed succeed in keeping illegal immigrants out altogether, carrying them out could ultimately pose health and safety problems for all Americans.
"Let's suppose we want to really save some money and get tough with all these illegal immigrants," said Prof. Nestor Rodriguez, a sociologist at the University of Houston who has studied immigrants here. "Here is what you would do: Close the doors to the hospitals, even when a woman is coming to give birth. Lock the kids out of school, and tell them they have no future at all. Do not pay for their immunizations. Do not let them use clinics. That is the way to save some really big money. But at what cost later on?"
 Marginal Existence With Much Help
 Laura C. and her family scrape by. It takes her an hour and a half to travel across town by bus to the city-run West End Multi-Service Center, where she picks up $26.50 in food stamps and about $20 in coupons from the Women, Infants and Children program. She also receives a small stipend under the food-stamp program for diapers.
In a cramped room at the welfare center, large posters in English read "Food Affects Our Moods" and "Food Influences Our Appearance."
"I don't even know what they say," Laura said.
The W.I.C. coupons, stamped "least expensive brand required," provide the family with nine gallons of milk a month, four dozen eggs, three pounds of cheese, four bottles of juice, two large boxes of cereal, two pounds of beans, one 18-ounce jar of peanut butter, two pounds of carrots and eight 31/2 -ounce cans of tuna fish.
"Some weeks there isn't enough at the end," Laura said, "but most of the time we can get by."
Laura's older sister arrived here illegally eight years ago and did well enough as a maid to send money to her parents in Veracruz, Mexico.
Unlike her sister, who has no children, Laura said her decision to come here was less a calculated decision than an act of desperation.
None of the three fathers, all in Mexico, have ever seen their children or provided support, she said.
Laura says she expected to work and her sister to help watch the children. She worked briefly cleaning houses for $25 a day and cooking tamales at an outdoor market. But then, she says, she got into a fight with her sister, who demanded that she get an abortion when she was six months' pregnant with Jacobo.
She refused and moved out; she lost both jobs because she had no one to look after the children. One prospective employer told her that if she applied for a job she would be reported to immigration authorities.
Desperate, she turned to a private women's shelter, which set her up in a rent-free one-bedroom apartment near a huge coffee factory in Houston's East End and told her how to apply for government benefits for her children.
Virtually everything in Laura's life is paid with scrip, which includes bus tokens she receives from the women's shelter. The only cash she sees is the occasional quarter or two she gets when she buys groceries.
She has built up the smallest of nest eggs -- $5.64 so far -- to pay for a small birthday party for Nicole this month. Food stamps will not pay for candles, ice cream or a toy.
Laura has used a public hospital once, for Jacobo's birth. The hospital bill for a birth without complications typically costs about $1,100 in Houston. The family has also used a city-financed clinic several times for the children's minor illnesses: a sore throat; a stomach virus.
 
Determined To Stay
 What if all these benefits and services were cut tomorrow?
"I don't think I would leave," Laura said.
She explained the difference between Houston and Matamoros, the Mexican border city she left.
"Here, if you see a child alone in the street without shoes, he is cared for," she said. "Somehow, that child will be cared for. There, no. There, you see children in the street, cleaning shoes, and people pass without seeing them."
Many politicians argue it is precisely this perception that induces people to come.
Representative Smith of Texas has proposed a bill that would cut off all benefits to illegal immigrants except emergency health care and public education. If the measure is enacted, Laura would lose about $12 a week in W.I.C. grocery coupons, and she and the two older children could stand to lose privileges at the city health clinic that receives some Federal money.
But Jacobo, the American-born baby, would retain full rights to welfare and Medicaid. He would continue to qualify for food stamps and his portion of the W.I.C. coupons. When he turns 5, he may qualify for larger welfare assistance.
That entitlement has led some politicians like Governor Wilson of California to call for a constitutional amendment to deny citizenship to the offspring of illegal aliens.
But this would be a difficult, long-term undertaking. Supporters of the California ballot initiative, which would bar illegal immigrants from the public schools, are trying a different legal strategy. If approved, the measure would violate Federal law, flouting the 1982 Supreme Court ruling giving all children in the United States the right to a public education.
But some politicians say the time is ripe for a challenge. The Court, they argue, is more conservative now than it was 12 years ago, and the original ruling resulted from a 5-to-4 split.
The proposals for aid cuts come in tandem with measures for keeping people like Laura out of the country. The California initiative would in some cases require schools and hospitals to report those suspected of being illegal aliens.
But deportation in Laura's case would be fraught with legal tangles, because of her American child.
And immigration officials say that with 2,000 miles of shallow riverbed and desert linking the United States and Mexico, sealing the border will never be feasible.
More than half of all illegal immigrants come from Mexico. Others fly in from Latin America, Asia or Europe, enter the country legally, by air as well as over land, then become illegal when they overstay their visas.
Many experts say that if the North American Free Trade Agreement succeeds in elevating economic conditions in Mexico, the forces that lead people to leave will wane.
In the meantime, the question of what to do with Laura and her family remains. She may get a job; then again, she may not.
"Rationally, we should cut off that woman's benefits and deport her if she's deportable," said Mark W. Davis, a former aide to Governor Wilson and now director of the Pacific Research Institute in San Francisco. "But in both humanitarian and practical terms, we find that extremely difficult to do. Humanitarian, because there are children involved. And practically, it's problematic because she'll be back."

HEADLINE: Political Battle Lines Drawn in California Races for Governor and Senator

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, June 7

 BODY:
Voting without much enthusiasm and coming up with no surprises, Californians nominated candidates today for this fall's elections for governor and the United States Senate, contests with national political implications.
For governor, Republicans chose the incumbent, Pete Wilson, and Democrats chose Treasurer Kathleen Brown. 
 For Senator, Democrats chose the incumbent, Dianne Feinstein, and Republicans chose Representative Michael Huffington of Santa Barbara.
All were easy winners.
Polls indicate that both fall races will probably be closely contested, with the flagging California economy the main issue, followed by crime, taxes and illegal immigration.
And if the primaries were good indicators, both races will be expensive, with the Huffington-Feinstein contest possibly setting a spending record for Congressional elections.
 
National Implications
 From a national standpoint, both fall contests are of interest for what they might say about Democratic and Republican Presidential prospects in 1996 in the country's most populous and politically powerful state. The Feinstein-Huffington race also will help determine whether Democrats retain control of the Senate and whether the small contingent of women in that body shrinks.
Almost from the start of the primary campaigning, there was no serious doubt about the outcome of today's voting, a factor that state election officials said appeared to have reduced voter turnout to below 40 percent, an unusually low level. The favored candidates spent most of their time campaigning against their presumed fall opponents and ignoring their primary opponents.
In the Republican primary for governor, the struggling California economy had deeply depressed Governor Wilson's job approval ratings. But by promising to be tough on crime and illegal immigration and by speeding aid to the Los Angeles area after the January earthquake, he overcame that serious political minus and handily overwhelmed his only major opponent, Ron Unz, the wealthy owner of a Silicon Valley computer company.
Mr. Unz, a 32-year-old hardline conservative, spent a $1 million of his fortune on a blitz of television ads that were highly critical of the Governor, a 60-year-old moderate conservative. While they did not carry the day for Mr. Unz, they may eventually have the unintended effect of softening up Mr. Wilson a bit for the coming bout with Ms. Brown.
With 10 percent of the state's precincts counted and a solid counting trend established, the Governor was leading Mr. Unz 66 percent to 30 percent.
"We've completed the first step," Mr. Wilson said tonight. "We're going to continue to making the kind of change that is going to make California all that it can be."
 
 
Shift by Brown
 In the Democratic primary for governor, Ms. Brown, a moderate liberal, easily overcame challenges by the State Insurance Commissioner, John Garamendi, and State Senator Tom Hayden, best know as one of the noisiest reformers of the 1960's but lately, at the age of 54, a soft, reasoned voice for change.
Mr. Brown, daughter of former Gov. Edmund G. (Pat) Brown and sister of former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr., had problems early on in her primary campaign, sometimes stumbling over questions about issues and at other times delivering speeches that seemed unfocused. But midway through the campaign, she reorganized her staff and her pitch -- she began to promise to create a million jobs in the state -- and thereafter she was never in political danger.
With 10 percent of the state's precincts counted, Ms. Brown had 49 percent of the votes, compared with 34 percent for Mr. Garamendi and 11 percent for Mr. Hayden.
"Not bad for a woman, a Democrat and a Brown," Ms. Brown said. Pre-primary polls in which voters were asked about a possible Brown-Wilson fall matchup showed Governor Wilson pulling slightly ahead with Ms. Brown after trailing her by 15 points or so throughout most of the year.
In today's Senate primaries, Ms. Feinstein, a 60-year-old moderate liberal, faced no major opponent in the Democratic contest. She first went to Washington two years ago but faces re-election this year rather than in 1998 because she was sent to serve out the unexpired term of Mr. Wilson, who returned early to California to become Governor.
Ms. Feinstein was not available for comment; her spokesmen said she was in Washington, where the Senate had just returned from the Memorial Day recess.
In the Republican primary, Mr. Huffington easily out ran his major opponents, former Representative William E. Dannemeyer, a 64-year-old hard-right conservative from Orange County.
With 11 percent of the state's precincts reporting, Mr. Huffington had 55 percent of the vote, compared with 28 percent for Mr. Dannemeyer.
"This is the Dianne Feinstein retirement committee," Mr. Huffington told cheering supporters tonight. "Feinstein says government is her life. Maybe it's time for her to get a life." Mr. Huffington's primary campaign was notable in that he poured $6.5 million of his $75 million oil fortune into a television blitz aimed almost entirely at attacking Ms. Feinstein. Seldom has so much been spent so early and so quickly.
But the spending paid off, making Mr. Huffington's name a household word with voters outside his home district, most of whom previously knew little or nothing about him.
Ms. Feinstein began to counter with her own ad campaign a few days ago.

HEADLINE: Largesse, Even Late

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ALBANY, June 7

 BODY:
In a $34 billion state budget with a $1.5 billion surplus to spread about like election-year tonic, it would be misleading to suggest there were winners and losers. More to the point, there were winners and lesser winners.
A vast majority of the state's 718 school districts will receive an increase in school aid. Seventeen towns will get new sports stadiums. Most corporations will pay lower corporate income taxes, and an influential few will receive reductions beyond that. And every county will benefit from $9.6 billion in road and bridge work over the next four years. 
 A newly found prosperity is making this budget largesse possible. What better times did not make possible was a timely budget, which had been due April 1. If nothing else, the stalemate that made this budget more than two months late will only reinforce the perception that the Governor and Legislature find consensus hard to reach. In the past, they have blamed their late budgets -- there have been 10 in a row now -- on the political difficulties of cutting programs. This year's revived economy made such excuses obsolete.
"When it comes to making a budget in New York, it seems as difficult to increase spending as it is to cut it," said Cynthia B. Green, deputy research director for the Citizens Budget Commission, a private advocacy group supported by businesses.
 
The Politics of Spring
 To Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and the 211 members of the State Legislature, the politically attractive content of this budget seemed to justify the posturing, stalling and political jockeying that filled the final days of budget negotiations. And for good reason: all are up for re-election this fall and all face voters grown testy after five years of recession, rising property taxes and bad-news budgets that cut popular programs.
"The budget process was hijacked by the politics of spring, meaning positioning for the November election," said Mitchell Moss, director of the Urban Research Center at New York University.
The many news releases this week spoke volumes of Mr. Cuomo's and lawmakers' admiration for their handiwork. The Republicans who control the Senate issued a 10-page scorecard showing how, in their view, they had one-upped Mr. Cuomo in winning $1.7 billion in business-tax cuts.
In more subdued but no less self-congratulatory tones, the Democratic-led Assembly praised the budget as providing low-cost health insurance and tax credits to the working poor.
 
'Brimming With Good News'
 And not to be outdone, Mr. Cuomo offered a 23-page release detailing how $9.6 billion will be spent in every corner of the state, from a new science library in New York City to landfill improvements in Clinton County to repairs to Buffalo's downtown music hall.
"This need not have been late, but it is arriving brimming with good news and evidence of our strong recovery," said Mr. Cuomo, who is facing perhaps his toughest campaign.
What the news releases shared beyond their air of satisfaction was a willingness to ignore the anxiety and problems created because the budget was 68 days late.
During that time, school and local officials could not plan their budgets because they did not know how much state aid to expect. Scores of state road projects were postponed and may now be finished late. Nonprofit agencies with state contracts had to take out loans to cover payrolls.
And the Legislature now has only three weeks in its session to deal with several major issues, including legalizing gambling, controlling medical malpractice costs and disposing of low-level radioactive waste.
 
No Towers, Just Hurdles
 Outside the Statehouse, there were plenty of critics willing to splash cold water on the celebration inside. Advocates for the poor said the budget did not restore money for social service programs that underwent deep cuts during the recession. Anti-tax groups said the tax cuts did not go far enough, while labor groups said they went too far. And environmentalists said the budget provided the bare minimum to protect open spaces and to clean up landfills.
This year there were no towering issues that prevented the final agreement, just numerous hurdles, which, once surmounted, were replaced by new ones. One week they fought over the size of the surplus: was it $500 million or a billion? Another week they bickered over $3 million in drug treatment programs for convicts. And for over a month they battled over whether New York City should receive 35.16 percent or 34.67 percent of the state's $9 billion in aid to local schools, a difference worth more than $40 million.
The frustratingly slow pace of talks inspired a bevy of theories. Some Democrats suggested that the Republican Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino, wanted to delay the budget beyond the Republican convention in May so he could penalize legislators who supported the gubernatorial candidacy of Senator George E. Pataki.
 
Concessions by Cuomo
 The Republicans theorized that Mr. Cuomo was holding up the budget so that he could attack the Legislature for overspending. And Mr. Cuomo completed the circle by accusing the lawmakers of stalling to squeeze more concessions from him.
In the end, Mr. Cuomo did have to give up things to break the deadlock.
The final agreement included most of the projects sought by lawmakers, including $24 million for a Nassau County aquatic center that the Governor had called a Taj Mahal.
He had called a Senate Republican proposal that would increase health care costs by $145 million "a tax hike," then agreed to a one-year version worth $95 million.
And he had fought hard for two educational programs -- a boarding school for gifted science and math students and scholarships for needy college students -- only to allow Republican critics to delay the scholarships and to curtail the boarding school proposal. Just last month, Mr. Cuomo had described the two programs as deal-breakers: so important that he would not sign any budget that did not include them.
But even if Mr. Cuomo lost on some fronts, he can now travel the campaign trail claiming credit for tax cuts and programs that he did not necessarily initiate and may have even criticized.
So, too, the same Republicans who accused Mr. Cuomo of being a tax-and-spend liberal can be expected to praise school aid and road projects in their districts.
"This was like a Valentine's Day card in June," said Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, a Westchester Democrat. "You're glad to get it; you just ask why it's so late."

HEADLINE: Governments Are Joining Haiti Force

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 7

 BODY:
Administration officials say they have enlisted about a dozen countries to take part in a United Nations task force of more than 3,000 soldiers and civilians who would maintain order and strengthen democratic institutions after the Haitian military leaders cede power, whether voluntarily or through military intervention.
In recent days, Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and William H. Gray 3d, the special adviser on Haiti, have asked countries throughout the Western Hemisphere to join the force, which is aimed at insuring the safe return of Haiti's exiled President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide. 
 The Administration's effort to line up broad participation is part of its stepped-up campaign to heighten political, economic and psychological pressure on Haiti's military leaders, who seized power in September 1991 and so far have been reluctant to give it up.
 
Quicker U.S. Exit
 For the Clinton Administration, one obvious benefit of a large United Nations mission is that if the United States invades Haiti to oust its military leaders, sending in the mission afterward would allow Washington to withdraw many of its troops quickly.
American officials declined to name the countries that have agreed to take part in the task force -- officially called the United Nations Mission on Haiti -- but officials in other countries said Canada, Venezuela and Argentina had agreed to contribute personnel.
"What if the coup leaders step down next week as a result of the economic sanctions?" Mr. Gray said in a telephone interview. "Who maintains order? Who protects the international relief organizations and embassies there? Who's there to protect the return of President Aristide and to insure his safety? You will need the U.N. mission right away."
Many nations in the Hemisphere oppose military intervention, and American officials recognize that the Administration could point to a broad-based United Nations mission as an international imprimatur for such intervention.
 
Some Oppose Invasion
 According to one official, several countries have said they would not participate in the United Nations mission if Haiti's military is forced out through military intervention.
Administration officials said the task force would be vital for maintaining safety and order to allow Father Aristide to return to Haiti should Haiti's military leaders step down because of pressures from the trade embargo.
"If the military leaves in a week or two, you would probably want the U.N. mission there before Aristide returns," Mr. Gray said. "It would assure law and order. It would make sure there was no retribution and could prevent another coup. If you have a power vacuum anything could happen. You could potentially have another level of military rise up and say, 'We're taking over.' "
Some Administration officials predict that it will take months for the embargo to work, while others say that only military intervention will succeed in forcing out the Haitian military. American officials say they are not asking other countries to contribute troops to an invasion.
 
U.S. Fears Anarchy
 American officials fear an embarrassing wave of anarchy and retribution between the time the military leaders leave and the time Father Aristide returns, either from international pressure or an invasion. With Haiti's military and police force expected to be in wholesale disarray, American officials see the United Nations mission serving as the beat cops until a government is running smoothly.
One senior American official said the United Nations mission would leave Haiti in early 1996, at the earliest, after presidential elections scheduled for December 1995.
In feverish diplomacy over the last week, the United States has persuaded other countries to back a task force that would be far larger and have far greater responsibilities than one set up last July as part of the Governors Island agreement. In that accord, the Haitian military agreed to turn over power to Father Aristide, but it later refused to honor that commitment.
The United Nations mission established under that agreement was to include about 800 soldiers and civilians and to concentrate on retraining Haiti's military and police force, who have a long history of repression and opposition to democracy.
 
A Protection Mission
 Mr. Gray said that the expanded, reconfigured task force not only would do such training, but that it would also be responsible for law enforcement and for protecting embassies, elected officials, human rights monitors and international relief organizations.
At a meeting today in Belem, Brazil, of the foreign ministers of the Organization of American States, the ministers called for enlarging the United Nations mission. They also backed an American-led call to ban all commercial flights to and from Haiti and to cut off financial transactions with Haiti.
Administration officials said today that President Clinton would announce unilateral action within a few days to ban flights and financial transactions between Haiti and the United States.
"It will take six months for Haiti's upper classes to be bitten" by the tougher United Nations sanctions approved last month, said a senior Administration official. "What you have to do is ratchet it up real quick so they feel the bite, so they can't keep their money in foreign banks or enjoy flying around in American planes."
Buoyed by the Dominican Republic's new efforts to clamp down on smuggling to Haiti, Administration officials have voiced increased confidence in recent days that the embargo might force Haiti's military from power.
Some Haiti specialists say the Administration adopted a more upbeat posture on the embargo after officials concluded that their privately stated pessimism about the sanctions was reinforcing the military's commitment to stay in power.
Dennis Boxx, a Defense Department spokesman, said today that a small number of American troops might soon go to the Dominican Republic to help provide "technical support" to fight smuggling to Haiti.

HEADLINE: North Korea Said to Have A-Bomb Fuel

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 6

 BODY:
North Korea could process the fuel it recently removed from its Yongbyon reactor by the end of the year and produce enough plutonium for four or five nuclear bombs, Administration officials said today.
The speed with which North Korea could reportedly break the remaining constraints on its nuclear program has raised the stakes for Washington's push to block that program. It has also become a key consideration in deliberations over what economic sanctions to seek and when to impose them. 
 The crisis was caused by North Korea's refusal to allow international inspectors to determine how much plutonium was diverted when North Korea first shut down its reactor in 1989.
But while Washington and its allies have been frustrated by North Korea's destruction of evidence of its past plutonium production, North Korea's nuclear program is also poised to leap forward.
 
A Surprising Efficiency
 Already the pace of the program has become a major worry for Washington. The Central Intelligence Agency has concluded that there is a better than even chance that North Korea has produced one or two nuclear bombs. But the production of additional plutonium would expand North Korea's nuclear potential and yield surplus bomb material to sell to other nations, officials say.
North Korea took a step toward expanding its bomb material when it shut down the five-megawatt reactor at Yongbyon in mid-April.
Administration officials were caught off guard by the decision to shut down the reactor, and surprised by the speed with which North Korea unloaded its spent fuel.
Officials initially thought it would take two or three months to remove the 8,000 rods of spent fuel, assuming that North Korea only had one machine to remove the rods. But North Korea has two machines.
 
Time May Be Growing Short
 So far North Korea has kept the rods in a cooling pond under the eyes of international monitors and special cameras operated by the International Atomic Energy Agency.
But Administration officials are worried that North Korea will use its growing dispute with the inspectors as a pretext to repudiate the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, abandon all controls on its nuclear program and produce more bomb-grade material.
If North Korea decided to reprocess more plutonium, it is positioned to move ahead quickly. A rule of thumb is that to avoid exposing workers to excessive radiation, technicians should wait 80 days after shutting down a reactor before taking rods to a reprocessing plant. Thus if North Korea follows these safety guidelines, it may begin reprocessing fuel in a matter of weeks.
An Administration expert said that if North Korea used one reprocessing line, it could produce enough plutonium for four or five bombs by the end of the year. And the North Koreans have been working to build a second line.
 
Analyzing the Schedule
 How long it would take North Korea to make bombs with the new supply of plutonium is unclear. Administration officials say their "worst case" estimate is that some new bombs might be produced by the end of the year; some officials speculate that it could take many months or even years.
Adding to Washington's concern, North Korea is also building a second, larger reactor. Defense Secretary William J. Perry has said the reactor will be completed in a few years and could produce material for 10 to 12 bombs a year.
North Korea's nuclear potential is an important consideration in the Administration's deliberations over economic sanctions.
Some experts say the speed with which North Korea can move forward on the nuclear front and its potential sales of bomb-grade material mean that Washington and its allies may not have time to gradually tighten sanctions. If sanctions are imposed, they say, it is important that they hurt the North Korean economy, and thus make clear to North Korea's leaders that they will pay a heavy price for their nuclear program.
 
Past the Threshold
 But other officials worry that tough sanctions may give North Korea a excuse to reject the nonproliferation treaty altogether and produce more plutonium. They say maintaining constraints on North Korea's future production is more important than resolving the mystery of how much plutonium may have been diverted in the past.
The prospects for a compromise look dimmer than ever. Yun Ho Jin, North Korea's representative to the International Atomic Energy Agency, said today that the North would never allow inspectors to visit two nuclear-waste sites to try to determine how much plutonium might have been diverted in past years.
And Hans Blix, the head of the United Nations agency, said it was not clear that such visits would suffice now that North Korea has destroyed other evidence of its past production.

HEADLINE: Iran Accuses U.S. of Reneging on Hostage Deal

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TEHERAN, Iran, June 7

 BODY:
President Hashemi Rafsanjani accused the United States today of reneging on secret assurances that Iranian assets frozen by the United States would be freed in exchange for Iranian mediation to gain the release of American hostages in Lebanon.
It was the first time since the Iran-contra arms-for-hostages affair of the Reagan Administration that a senior Iranian official had asserted that an American-Iranian deal had been reached for the release of Western hostages in Lebanon. 
 "We have ample reason to distrust the Americans," Mr. Rafsanjani said at a news conference in Teheran today. "The U.N. Secretary General had told us that if we use our contacts to free Americans and other Western hostages in Lebanon, the United States would release our assets. In this one instance, the Americans could have demonstrated their goodwill. But in effect, they did not even live up to the promises of the Secretary General."
Mr. Rafsanjani gave no details of the assurances from the United Nations. But he was apparently referring to Javier Perez de Cuellar, who traveled to Iran twice in 1990 and 1991 as United Nations Secretary General. Militant Lebanese groups released 10 Western hostages in late 1991.
In November 1991, the United States and Iran reached an agreement under which the United States returned $278 million for military claims by Iran, and the Bush Administration issued a statement clearing Iran of involvement in the bombing of a jetliner over Scotland in 1988, in which 270 people were killed.
Reacting to Mr. Rafsanjani's remarks today, a State Department official said: "It's not the first time the Iranians have given the impression that it's a one-sided thing about unfreezing assets. The whole issue is part of a long, drawn-out process that is before the International Court of Justice in The Hague. That process is continuing."
Iran claims that more than $11 billion of its assets were frozen by the United States in 1979 when Washington broke off relations with Teheran, but United States officials estimate the value of the assets at $1 billion.
Last year, the Clinton Administration called Iran "an international outlaw" and vowed to use economic pressure to try to persuade Teheran to change its policies. Trade between the United States and Iran increased 14-fold between 1989 and 1992, according to State Department figures.
Mr. Rafsanjani said today that Iran had no intention of suspending trade with the United States. American oil companies are the biggest buyers of Iranian oil.

HEADLINE: Alternative Sites for Yankee Stadium Are Studied

BYLINE: By MATTHEW PURDY 

 BODY:
City and state officials have begun examining sites other than the South Bronx as a home for a new Yankee Stadium, at the request of team officials who say fans are staying away from home games because of concerns about safety in that neighborhood.
Officials said last night that 8 to 10 sites in all 5 boroughs are under study, including the rail yards on the West Side of Manhattan, where Gov. Mario M. Cuomo had earlier proposed building a stadium over the tracks. 
 The Yankees' lease on the current Yankee Stadium, which is owned by the city, is due to expire in 2002. For more than a year, the team and its principal owner, George Steinbrenner, have engaged in on-again, off-again discussions with city officials over the team's plans for the future.
Now, even as the Yankees are having their best season on the field in years, team officials have complained to the city that attendance is woefully low, and that they believe it is linked to perceptions about crime in the area. Yankee officials have also informed the Giuliani administration that they have recently renewed negotiations with New Jersey officials about moving to the Meadowlands sports complex.
"Both of us, the city and the state, have made clear that our very strong preference is for them to stay in the Bronx," said John Dyson, New York City's Deputy Mayor for economic development. "On the other hand, in light of their request, while we don't want to lose them from the Bronx, we don't want to lose them from New York City, and we don't want to lose them from New York State."
Mr. Dyson said he did not believe that team officials were determined to leave the South Bronx, but said that "since they only get to make this decision every 30 years" they thought it prudent to consider other locations. Yankee officials could not be reached last night.
Even as the city and state search for alternative sites, the officials are also continuing to plan a renovation of the current stadium. Vincent Tese, the chairman of the State Urban Development Corporation, which is a partner with the city in the Yankees project, said he still believed a compelling case could be made for keeping the Yankees in the Bronx.
"We think it's important to the economy of the Bronx," he said. "We think it's also a historic place. We think we can make a statement in the Bronx that will satisfy the Yankees and the community."
John Lawn, the Yankees' vice president for operations, requested the search for alternative sites in a May 11 letter to city officials. In his letter, Mr. Lawn said the Yankees -- with the best record in the American League -- rank 8th in the American League and 17th in the major leagues in terms of home attendance. The letter also says that attendance at Yankee Stadium is 30 percent higher for day games than for night games.
That disparity, Mr. Lawn said in his letter, "suggests the perceptions about security may be a critical factor in decisions to attend a game at Yankee Stadium."
Attendance has increased this year over last year, however. Through the first 31 home games last season the Yankees drew 681,539 fans, an average of 21,985. Through 31 dates this season they have drawn 800,177, an average of 25,812.
City and state officials contend that the crime around Yankee Stadium during games is very low because of a 80-member police detail that patrols the area when the team is in town. But both Mr. Dyson and Mr. Tese acknowledge that the perception of crime is a real issue that must be dealt with.
"If you're going to get the fans, you have to answer their concerns," Mr. Dyson said.
The request from the Yankees came as the city and the state were planning a renovation of Yankee Stadium that was designed to address safety concerns. The stadium renovation, estimated to cost $250 million, was expected to include indoor parking for 12,000 to 15,000 cars and a Metro-North station in the stadium area, to allow fans to go to games without having to set foot in the streets of the South Bronx.
Mr. Dyson also said city and state officials have been considering coupling the stadium renovation with a renewal effort in the neighborhood, both to benefit residents there and to ease the fears of Yankee fans. The Giuliani administration has included Yankee Stadium in the city's application for designation as a Federal Empowerment Zone, which would allow that area to share in a $100 million economic development grant.
Mr. Dyson said he believed it would be difficult to find a suitable alternative site in the city. He said a stadium site must be at least 30 acres, geologically sound for building, accessible and free from environmental problems that would be expensive to remedy.
In addition to the Manhattan rail yards site, officials said, areas under consideration include Ferry Point in the Bronx, the Charleston section of Staten Island, a tract on 207th Street in Manhattan, Coney Island, the Brooklyn Marine Terminal, the old Flushing Airport in Queens and Phelham Bay Park in the Bronx.

HEADLINE: Clinton in Normandy: Hands Across a Generation

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PARIS, June 7

 BODY:
It was the soldiers whom people will long remember. Mostly brittle old men now, no longer the lusty youngsters who "saved the world," they were touching in their simple eloquence, heartbreaking in their heartache for their lost comrades.
Like the old men of the Grand Army of the Republic, veterans of Bull Run and Vicksburg and Antietam who lived through the direst days of their century, the survivors of the first momentous hours on the Calvados coast half a century ago have become icons for today, the symbols of courage and conviction that democracies crave. 
 Lincoln at Gettysburg said the world would "little note nor long remember" what he said there, dedicating a cemetery for the fallen in the most awful battle in America's most awful war. What he meant was that no words, not even his, had power adequate to the task of memorializing the deeds of those whose graves lay around him.
President Clinton succeeded in his D-Day speeches not because he made speeches worthy of comparison with Lincoln's or perhaps even with Ronald Reagan's "These are the boys of Pointe du Hoc . . ." of 10 years ago. He succeeded because with the help of many others he managed to keep attention focused on the veterans, not on himself and his problems.
 
A Plea to the Young
 Fully aware that their hour on the world's stage is nearing its end, many of them appealed earnestly to those they will leave behind, denizens of a world that sometimes has a lot of trouble telling right from wrong, to remember the values that inspired the heroism of their international band of brothers in Operation Overlord.
Amid the barbed wire and the artillery craters of Pointe du Hoc, a former Ranger, Richard Hathaway, said on Monday:
"Nations can and should unite to form the strongest possible bonds, devoted to all mankind so that they may enjoy freedom from oppression, freedom from fear, freedom from want, freedom of expression and freedom of religion. We leave this to you, for only by this can you and your descendants enjoy a free society of all mankind, devoid of such destructive forces as were exhibited here."
Many of the veterans fear that the young, President Clinton perhaps included, are all too prone to turn away from trouble abroad. So they were pleased with the repect that he bestowed on them and their ideas, not only by coming but also by urging members of his generation to learn the lessons of their struggle and sacrifice.
"It's an honor," Mr. Clinton said to almost every one of the hundreds of World War II veterans he met during his European tour.
 
Evocative Ceremonies
 For one aging onlooker at least, the ceremonies were most evocative. The old planes, the parachutes descending again near Ste.-Mere-Eglise, on whose church steeple Pvt. John Steele dangled for hours before being cut down, the coffin-shaped boats back at Omaha Beach, the stories the veterans told -- all rekindled the emotions stirred by the broadcasts of George Hicks, the radio networks' pool man on a ship out in the English Channel on June 6, 1944.
With very nearly every American household tuned in, with the big naval guns drumming behind him, Hicks reported the thrilling news: "The landing craft have been disembarked from their mother ships and are moving in irregular lines toward the horizon of France. All over the surface of the sea they can be seen cutting and zigzagging and heading toward the ribbon of land that's the coast of Normandy."
Fifty years later, the politicians did their part, secular priests in a secular age, in the solemn rites commemorating the D-Day landings. President Clinton found a few eloquent phrases for the preliminary ceremonies, then produced a gem of a speech late in the day for the main event at the American cemetery above Omaha Beach.
It would have been unseemly for anything to outshine the ordinary men who discovered such extraordinary things within themselves in the storms of fire they found on Normandy's cliffs and beaches.
"For a few days," said Lane Kirkland, the head of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., who was a merchant seaman in World War II, "the spirit of World War II lived again. I tried to give a tip to a cabdriver in London, and he refused to take it. 'No,' he told me, 'You saved us.' "
 
'Didn't Disgrace Himself'
 Called upon by the workings of the calendar to lead what will probably be the last ceremonies on such a vast scale, the President began with three strikes against him, but he refused to accept that he was already out. He is the first President since the World War II to have played no military role. He avoided the draft in Vietnam. He had a tough act to follow in Mr. Reagan, one of the great orchestrators of national emotion, a master of nostalgia and the might-have-been.
"He didn't disgrace himself, and that's what counts," said a senior American official in Europe. "If he had seemed callow, or ill informed, or lacking in respect, if he had grandstanded, that would have been terrible for him and the country.
"As it was, he gained some respect from the older generation, I think, by showing them the deference they deserve and insisting everywhere that their experience shows us where we ought to go. I doubt that that struck much of a chord with the younger generations, but that's not his doing."
Mr. Clinton will return to the United States after meetings and speeches in Paris today and a return to Oxford on Wednesday that is sure to revive talk of his antiwar sentiments during his days as a student there. It seems likely that in domestic terms he has been neither strengthened nor weakened by this second European tour of his 16-month-old Administration.
 
Clinton's Burdens
 No one can convincingly suggest any longer that the big ceremonial moments are beyond Mr. Clinton. He demonstrated that he can put aside his compulsively, sometimes exuberantly informal style for occasions requiring dignity and restraint. If his youth and inexperience sometimes deny his words the weight he would like them to carry, if the imagery he and his aides choose often seems forced or corny, he has shown himself capable of addressing complex issues involving many countries with varied interests and histories.
But health care is still in trouble, the more so with the indictment of Representative Dan Rostenkowski; the Democrats are still back on their heels in electoral politics, having lost almost every election before the off-year balloting in November, and the civil lawsuit brought against Mr. Clinton by Paula Corbin Jones still throws a long, foreboding shadow.
If he passed the test in the ceremonies in Britain and France, the President came a cropper, to a degree, in Italy. He felt that he had to honor the veterans of the "forgotten campaign" to liberate Rome as well as those who served in northern Europe, his aides reported, but in Italy itself and much of the rest of Europe he was seen as simultaneously celebrating the defeat of Fascism and condoning the entry of its offspring, the neo-Fascist National Alliance, into the new Italian Government.
 
On the Agenda
 What the Europeans wonder about is his strategic sense. It was clear, a top French politician said today, that Mr. Clinton was having more trouble than he should in balancing economic and political considerations, as on China, and in deciding where and in what kinds of situations American strength and prestige should be committed.
The President will be back on the Continent this month for the annual meeting of the seven biggest industrial powers, a meeting, this time in Naples, that will focus more than ever before on question of trade, now seen as the key to the domestic economic problems of the big nations.
After that, Mr. Clinton is to meet with President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia, also in Italy, and then will spend about 36 hours in Bonn and Berlin. In Berlin, he will hold a meeting in the Reichstag, walk through the Brandenburg Gate and ceremonially disband the Berlin Brigade -- powerful symbols of the end of Berlin's time as a ward of the West and its central new role in a unified Germany.
Those will be important days for Mr. Clinton and for his country, for it is trade, not war, and Germany and Russia, not so much Britain and France, that hold the key to future relations between the United States and Europe.

HEADLINE: Israel and Jordan Make Progress in Talks

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 7

 BODY:
Israel and Jordan agreed today on moves to prepare for peace, including establishment of a cross-border park and construction of a road linking both countries to Egypt.
"The accomplishments of this session have surpassed expectations," said the Jordanian Ambassador, Fayez Tarawneh. 
 Among the accords after two days of talks were an agreement in principle on building a road to link Aqaba and Eilat, the Jordanian and Israeli Red Sea ports, with each other and with Egypt, and a plan to set up a commission on boundaries, water, energy and the environment, some of the most difficult issues. Talks on these matters are to be moved to Israel and Jordan in July.
The two sides also decided to draft an outline of future trade and economic relations and to invite Palestinians to discuss cooperation in trade, finance and banking.
The two sides agreed that the United States would consolidate Jordanian and Israeli plans on development of the Jordan Valley into one master plan. The border runs through the valley.
They also agreed to designate one official from each side to coordinate on a "trans-boundary cultural heritage park" in the Jordan Valley.

HEADLINE: Fingerprinting For Welfare Is Defended

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani vowed yesterday to move ahead with a plan to fingerprint welfare recipients, despite an agreement between Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and the State Legislature that would exclude New York City from a pilot program involving 12 counties.
Mr. Giuliani, who says such a system would reduce welfare fraud, maintained that fingerprinting did not amount to a change in welfare eligibility standards and therefore did not need state approval. 
 "Finger or hand imaging is a form of identification," he said at a news conference. "It is not another requirement. It isn't saying that you have to be of a certain age, that you have to live in a certain area or that you have to be of a certain income level."
But the Mayor's determination to move ahead seemed likely to result in a court challenge. Patricia Lynch, a spokeswoman for Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, said Mr. Silver, the Manhattan Democrat, who has opposed fingerprinting, did not believe the city could act on its own.
 
Challenge Is Possible
 Although Mr. Cuomo has expressed his support in the past for a statewide fingerprinting program, he left open the possibility of challenging local governments that decide to start programs of their own without state authorization. Anne W. Crowley, the Governor's press secretary, said last night that he would have to study the "legal implications" of such a move.
Mr. Giuliani first endorsed fingerprinting of welfare recipients when he announced his financial plan in February, arguing that it would reduce fraud and perhaps build more political support for welfare by insuring that only the needy were receiving compensation.
He has projected in his own budget for the fiscal year beginning July 1 that the city could save $7 million by using fingerprinting to root out fraud in the home relief program, which provides welfare benefits to more than 304,000 people in New York City, many of them single adults. The projected savings would grow to more than $60 million in the next fiscal year, when the program could be fully in place.
To expand the program to the city's full welfare caseload of more than one million, the city would need Federal approval similar to that granted to California. Mr. Giuliani has said he will apply for such a waiver.
The Mayor said yesterday he was exploring the possibility of working with Nassau, Suffolk or Westchester Counties to put the fingerprinting program in place. "We are looking at three or four different ways to do that which may include doing it with at least one other, possibly two other counties," he said, but did not specify further. Suffolk is one of the 12 counties selected by the Governor and the Legislature to test fingerprinting during the next two years.
An aide to Mr. Giuliani said the city was looking to join other counties because there could be "economies of scale" if the electronic equipment needed for fingerprinting was leased or purchased in conjunction with other counties. The aide did not put a cost figure on the machinery.
David Vieser, a spokesman for the Nassau County Executive, Thomas S. Gulotta, said Nassau also intended to move ahead with fingerprinting despite its exclusion from the state program and would welcome the city's participation "because it would be more effective if we had a finger imaging process on both sides of the county."
He said Nassau was beginning negotiations this week to lease equipment from the vendor that would be used by Suffolk County.
The technology for fingerprinting includes an optical scanner connected to a data bank that can compare a set of prints to thousands of others on file in minutes. There is no ink: the computer electronically converts a print into a mathematical formula.
Fingerprinting of welfare recipients, which Democrats have argued equates the needy with criminals, has been a partisan issue in Albany, sharply dividing the Republican-controlled State Senate from Democrats who run the Assembly.
As a compromise, Mr. Silver agreed in budget negotiations to expand a test of fingerprinting underway in Rockland and Onondaga Counties to 10 more counties. The program would expire in two years and then be evaluated.
Mr. Silver said he argued against including New York City, which has two-thirds of the state's welfare recipients, because the equipment would cost too much to be used on a trial basis in a program he considered untested.

HEADLINE: The Tug of Memory, the Call of Home;
With Apartheid's End, South African Emigres Wrestle With Options

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: NEW HYDE PARK, L.I.

 BODY:
Courtly and silver-haired, Dr. Philip Lanzkowski is a prominent physician, chief of staff of a children's hospital here. But there is one corner of his life he has not always felt comfortable confiding: his origins in South Africa.
"The politics was embarrassing to me," he said. "At times I was ashamed to mention to people that I'd been a South African." 
 But that is changing. The end of apartheid and the election of a democratic, multiracial government are subtly transforming the lives of the roughly 100,000 emigres in the United States, 70 percent of whom are white, and the 25,000 who live in the New York metropolitan region. For one thing, they have shed their defensiveness.
 
A Burden Lifted
 "I feel like I've been freed of the burden of defending or answering to people about South Africa," said Dr. Lanzkowski, who left his country because he did not want to raise children under apartheid.
Many expatriates have also begun to let themselves feel the pull towards the bronze mountains and wild seas of home. A few are even contemplating returning, though such notions are made risky by South Africa's uncertain future and are complicated by the presence of American spouses, children and careers.
"I'm finding that for the first time since I left I can allow myself to love South Africa again," said Brian M. Rom, who runs a software company for institutional investors.
 
Embracing Home
 Having despaired of seeing any change in its political system, Mr. Rom, a 46-year-old white South African, all but abandoned the idea of even visiting the country again. But suddenly he is flirting with the prospect of retirement one day to his boyhood turf in the province of Natal.
It is impossible to say how many others are making similar plans. The South African consulate in New York said no figures were available on the number of expatriates who are returning, because native South Africans do not need any special papers to move back.
Many emigres say Americans fail to appreciate that emigres could have despised South Africa's racist government, but still have felt bound up with the land of their birth and its people.
Of course, some emigrants were comfortable with apartheid, or turned a blind eye, and left for practical reasons. They could not see a future in South Africa, either because of its economic ostracism by other nations or because they thought a black government would strip away white privilege.
Whatever their motives for coming, the emigres have been forced to wrestle with their souls -- and options -- once again.
Although Sikhulu Shange, who is black, left his country 30 years ago to wage an exile's struggle against apartheid and intended to return when apartheid was overcome, he now has anchors here: his music store on 125th Street in Harlem, and three grown daughters and three grandchildren who were raised in New York City. So Mr. Shange will proceed cautiously, exploring the possibility of opening a music outlet in South Africa while keeping his Harlem store to train both Americans and Africans in retailing.
"I have lived with my brothers and sisters in the diaspora for a long time and it is not very difficult for me to survive," he said. "But home is home. I long for it. I want to go back to the land where I was born and be a father and grandfather who's able to come up with the answers when everyone runs short."
John Baskind, a white specialist in political advertising, fled South Africa 13 years ago to avoid service in an army enforcing apartheid, and joined the African National Congress here. Now he too is thinking of returning. He wants to be part of the new South Africa and to reacquaint himself with the things he never stopped pining for.
 
Earth, Trees and Memory
 "It's the little things like the smell of the dust, the red earth, the green trees and my grandfather's grave in Johannesburg," said Mr. Baskind, who grew up in a farming village north of Johannesburg. "I was born in the bush and grew up in the bush, and those are one's most powerful memories."
For longtime opponents of apartheid, there is a bitterness along with the intoxication of recent weeks -- the anger of knowing that if South Africa's transformation had happened a generation ago, they would have been spared the anguish of tearing themselves from their country.
"My parents were deprived of their children and grandchildren," said Dr. Lanzkowski, the 62-year-old chief of staff of Schneider Children's Hospital at Long Island Jewish Medical Center. "Here people were looking at me as the oppressor, but I left because I was a victim. What did I need to be an American for?"
South Africans started coming here in significant numbers three decades ago for many reasons.
"I was raised to leave that country," said Danny Abelson, a 43-year-old advertising executive who came to study at the University of Pennsylvania. "Like many white liberals I was raised with the disorienting feeling that we were good people living in a bad system."
It is difficult to find a white South African here who will admit to condoning apartheid, though some will say so privately.
"We sucked in racism with our mother's milk," said one suburban businessman who spoke only on condition of anonymity. "As bad as things were for blacks, we learned to accept that blacks weren't quite human. Of course, I've heard more racism in this country than I ever heard in South Africa. The difference is it isn't officially sanctioned."
 
Migratory Habits
 Afrikaners, the whites whose Dutch ancestors began settling in the country more than three centuries ago and whose leaders imposed apartheid in 1948, seldom emigrated because they overwhelmingly supported the government or had few connections abroad. Far more prevalent among the emigres have been descendants of the English who colonized South Africa or the Jews who migrated to South Africa in the late 19th century to flee the Russian pogroms and army. These groups were more likely to oppose apartheid and found it easier to transplant themselves.
Although many expatriates came with a cushion of affluence, most still found the passage traumatic. They had to requalify for professional licenses or start businesses while mourning the loss of their land and the distance from relatives.
Most have navigated the transition well, consular officials say. They now live in New York suburbs like Westchester, Fairfield and Bergen Counties, and the suburbs of Boston, Houston or San Diego that in many cases resemble the neighborhoods of their childhood: overwhelmingly white and prosperous with emerald lawns and household help. Yet most say they have never felt quite American.
"I still feel very connected to South Africa," said Beryl Bresgi, a librarian in Teaneck, N.J. "This is still a foreign country for me."
Mr. Baskind says he feels more African than European or American. Africans, black and white, are far more accepting of other people and less cynical, he said. They have a more elastic sense of time, and are more gregarious, he said. Indeed, Mr. Baskind argued, there is far more similarity between black and white South Africans than between black South Africans and black Americans or white South Africans and white Americans.
A handful of South Africans have made it their business to work with their fellow emigres. Ash Caplan came here from Cape Town in 1986 and, using his brother-in-law's garage, started making biltong, the dried beef jerky that South Africans gnaw on as a snack. Now he owns a mail-order business in Wilton, Conn., that furnishes South Africans with chutneys, fish paste and the sausage known as boerewors.
Three years ago, Larry Shore, a bearded 42-year-old professor of communications at Hunter College who fled to avoid serving in the army, formed the Organization of South African-Americans and Canadians, and it now has a data base listing 800 expatriates. The group's principal purpose is to provide expertise and money to a post-apartheid society, for such needs as training rural nurses and financing rural schools.
Still, now is a time of celebration. Last Saturday, the organization invited emigres to a party at Hunter College to toast South Africa's new government.
"I'd like to take my American wife to see South Africa," said Mr. Shore, who long avoided going back. "I want to show her what a beautiful country it is, and now I want to show her what a remarkable country it is, that it has been able to come through this when many other countries would have collapsed."

GRAPHIC: Photos: The time when immigrants from South Africa were reluctant to speak of their past is changing. Dr. Philip Lanzkowski and his wife, Rhona, a psychotherapist, now live in Great Neck, Long Island. "I feel like I've been freed of the burden of defending or answering to people about South Africa," he said. (Rebecca Cooney for The New York Times); Sikhulu Shange, who left his country 30 years ago, said he longs to return home. "I want to go back to the land where I was born and be a father and grandfather who's able to come up with the answers when everyone runs short." He runs a music shop on West 125th Street.

HEADLINE: A Big Gain In Consumer Borrowing

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 7

 BODY:
Consumers borrowed $8.9 billion more in installment loans than they paid off in April, raising credit-card use by a record amount, the Federal Reserve reported today. It was the biggest overall rise in more than nine years.
The surprisingly vigorous gain in borrowing, which was on top of a $1 billion upward revision for March, was generally considered to be a sign of continued confidence by households in their ability to handle new debt and not as a sign that they were pressed for cash and forced to borrow. Installment loans include credit-card debt, automobile loans and other personal loans. 
 "Consumers feel better about the economy and their financial position," said Allen Sinai, chief economist for Lehman Brothers Global Economics in New York.
But other factors may also have played a role, analysts said. Some of the borrowing boom probably reflected April 15 income tax payments, which included sizable increases for the well-to-do this year. The April borrowing may also have been swollen by Easter-related purchases in late March that were not immediately posted.
It was also possible, but difficult to demonstrate, that a portion of the jump reflected distress -- borrowing on high-interest credit cards by consumers who had no other choice.
 
Sign of Economic Growth
 But Richard D. Rippe, chief economist at Prudential Securities, said he would be surprised if such pressure had arisen so suddenly. He attributed the increase mainly to general economic vigor. "Private credit demands are picking up and we're in the phase of the expansion when that should be happening," he said.
Revolving, or credit-card, credit jumped $5 billion in April after rising a modest $1.4 billion in March, the report showed.
Automobile credit slowed to a gain of $2.8 billion, from $3.8 billion in March, consistent with previously issued data on sales.
Home equity and other borrowing secured by real estate is not included in these figures, providing one reason for analysts' interpretive caution. Another is that credit cards are increasingly used for convenience rather than because of a real need to borrow -- and the figures are further muddied by developments like the awarding of frequent-flier miles for credit-card use.
Mr. Sinai said a recent study he conducted showed that a surprisingly large proportion of households with incomes of at least $75,000 a year kept credit-card balances even though they could have avoided them.
 
An 11-Month Climb
 April was the 11th consecutive month of expanding installment credit, but the streak would have stretched back to the immediate aftermath of the 1990-91 recession had it not been for a statistically aberrant decline last May.
The rise in total installment debt in April was at an annual rate of 13.2 percent, with automobile credit expanding at an 11.9 percent pace, revolving credit at 20.7 percent and other credit at 5.5 percent, the Fed also reported.
The $8.9 billion surge for the month compared with a revised March advance of $8.4 billion, up from the $7.4 billion originally estimated.
The Federal Reserve also said the average interest rate for a 48-month new-car loan was 7.76 percent in May, up from 7.54 percent in February. During the same three-month period, rates on 24-month personal loans rose to 12.96 percent, from 12.89 percent, while credit-card rates rose to 16.15 percent, from 16.06 percent.

HEADLINE: Dow Falls 12.61 in Lackluster Trading

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
The stock market closed down slightly yesterday, following the falling bond market, as traders posted the 11th consecutive day of below-average trading volume on the New York Stock Exchange.
Blue chips like Caterpillar and the Aluminum Company of America, cellular telephone companies like Airtouch Communications and regional banks like Banc One all fell, as did Nasdaq stocks like Microsoft and Cisco Systems. 
 Traders seemed to lack a compelling reason to bid stock prices higher. "The market is, if you will, tired," said William N. Allyn, director of listed equity trading at Jefferies & Company. "The good news about a growing economy, low inflation and strong first-quarter earnings is out of the way, and the market is looking for something else."
 
 
Taking Cues From Bonds
 Mr. Allyn said that for the next few weeks, traders were likely to bid stock prices up and down slightly, following trends in the bond market. But the stock market will be essentially lackluster until some earnings or other surprise next month prompts a rally, he said.
Yesterday, long-term interest rates rose, raising borrowing costs for corporations and hurting stocks. Ending a four-session rally, the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose to 7.26 percent, from 7.21 percent the day before.
Futures contracts for commodities, a proxy for the inflation outlook of commodities traders, moved up slightly. The Commodity Research Bureau index rose 0.12 point, to 228.96, after falling for three consecutive sessions. The price outlook for copper, coffee and sugar rose moderately, almost outweighed by declines in cattle, lumber and pork bellies.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 12.61 points, to 3,755.91, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 0.67 point, to 458.21. The smaller-company Nasdaq composite index fell 4.13 points, to 739.30.
 Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was again less than normal, with 234.7 million shares changing hands, about 21 percent less than the average of 297 million shares this year.
The Sprint Corporation, frustrated about failed merger talks with Electronic Data Systems, said yesterday that it was considering selling minority stakes of Sprint to the two largest European telephone companies, France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom.
The move would strengthen Sprint's presence in the European market, which will begin to resemble that of the United States when major government-owned carriers like France Telecom become privatized in the next few years. Shares of Sprint rose 1 3/8, to 39 3/8.
 
 
Equitable's Real Estate Plans
 The Equitable Companies said it planned to expand its real estate operations by providing $1 billion in hotel financing. Equitable stock fell 1/4, to 22 1/4.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 0.47 point, to 253.70, with advancing stocks lagging behind declining stocks, 902 to 1,190. The American Stock Exchange market value index fell 0.10 point, to 442.49.
Of the 30 components of the Dow industrial average, 14 fell. The declining components were led by Caterpillar, which fell 2 1/4, to 106, on no apparent news.
Of the 500 components that make up the S.& P. 500, 247 fell, led by the Harris Corporation, the electronics, communications and office equipment company. Its stock fell 1/8, to 48 3/4.
Microsoft, the software giant, was again the most active stock at 10.4 million shares, after Monday's one-day Nasdaq record of 47.8 million shares. Microsoft was included in the S.& P. 500 yesterday, but it stock fell 7/8, to 53 5/8.
The second-most-active stock, at 4.4 million shares, was Chrysler, which fell 7/8, to 45 1/2.

HEADLINE: O.E.C.D. Suggests Ways to Fight Unemployment

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PARIS, June 7

 BODY:
Confident that the industrialized world is pulling out of recession, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development today urged that advanced nations introduce new flexibility to their labor markets to combat stubbornly high levels of unemployment.
In doing so, the organization, based in Paris, identified the most politically explosive question facing many Western European governments: how to reduce "structural" unemployment without eroding living standards and slashing welfare and other social benefits? 
 A report to the opening session of the organization's annual ministerial meeting said that with 35 million people now out of work in its 25 member countries, unemployment "is probably the most widely feared phenomenon of our times." And it warned, "It brings with it unraveling of the social fabric, including a loss of authority of the democratic system."
 
Low Pay, but More Jobs

 
 The report, which is based on a two-year study, noted that the crisis was most severe in the 12 nations of the European Union, where unemployment now averages 11.7 percent, in part because of the high cost of creating jobs. In contrast, it said, the United States has far lower unemployment -- now 6 percent -- but many more low-skill jobs paying low wages.
Attending the meeting, Robert B. Reich, the United States Secretary of Labor, said the United States had been a "job machine," creating three million new jobs in the last 16 months.
"The problem is that most are low-wage jobs," Mr. Reich told reporters after today's session. "The long-term trend is toward a widening gap between the top and the bottom of the income ladder."
The O.E.C.D., which monitors economic trends and policy for the wealthier industrialized countries, said the problem of joblessness would not be eliminated simply through an economic recovery. Rather, it noted, additional measures would be needed to attack structural unemployment.
As distinct from cyclical unemployment, which rises and falls with economic activity, structural unemployment reflects an economy's failure to adjust to automation, other new technologies, and changes in the global economy, including intensified competition.
 
Labor Policies Addressed

 
 Some of the organization's recommendations are fairly general, such as urging governments to seek sustainable growth, to promote new technology, to improve job training programs and to help the creation of new businesses.
But other recommendations deal directly with the labor market and are certain to be controversial. These include: adopting flexible working times, such as part-time work or early retirement; discouraging minimum wages or at least linking them to age and region; permitting job-creation programs at below-average wage levels; making it easier for employers to dismiss staff, and linking unemployment benefits to a continued search for work.
This afternoon, ministers endorsed "the main conclusions" of the report, but with a caveat. They agreed to enact its recommendations "within the context of their particular economic circumstances," a clear sign that some governments are fearful of tampering with social rights.
"A further cut in benefits or assistance cannot be considered a political option in my opinion," Austria's Labor Minister, Josef Hesoun, told the meeting. Belgium's Finance Minister, Philippe Maystadt, said some of the O.E.C.D.'s recommendations risked "provoking social breakdown."
But Hans Christopherson, the European Union's economics commissioner, suggested that European governments had little choice. Asked if they had the courage to slash benefits, he retorted, "Do they have the guts to live with 12, 15, 18 percent unemployment?"
 
'A Third Way'

 
 Mr. Reich said developed nations appeared to face the choice between creating new jobs and preserving a social safety net, but he argued that the Clinton Administration believed there was "a third way" that would both increase the number of new jobs and raise wage levels.
The Labor Secretary said this approach was based on three principles: improving the quality of the work force through education and training; adapting the labor market to economic changes by, for example, aiding the movement of workers between industries, and moving from social safety nets to "springboards to employment."
"The longer people are out of work, the harder it is to find a job," he said.
The United States Treasury Secretary, Lloyd Bentsen, who is also attending the meeting, focused his attention on the need to bolster new growth in the global economy. "Japan and Europe must strengthen their recoveries," he said. "And it will take more than interest cuts or fiscal support for recovery. It will require structural reforms."

Crude Oil Prices Fall Steeply Amid fears of Oversupply

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Crude oil prices posted their largest decline in more than two months yesterday amid traders' concerns that gasoline supplies are rising and that a United Nations oil embargo against Iraq could move a step closer to ending.
On other commodity markets, copper and soybeans rose while lumber prices fell. The Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 commodities rose 0.12 point, to 228.96. 
 Gasoline supplies appear more than ample, analysts said. Refiners operated at 95.3 percent of capacity in the week ended May 27, up from 94.1 percent the week before, according to the American Petroleum Institute.
Meanwhile, Iraq hinted that it might be moving closer to recognizing Kuwait as a sovereign state, which it must do before the August 1990 ban by the United Nations on Iraqi crude oil exports is lifted.
 
July Crude Falls 36 Cents
 At the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil for July delivery dropped to $17.63 a barrel before rebounding to settle at $17.75 a barrel, down 36 cents. July unleaded gasoline fell 1.53 cents, to 51.35 cents a gallon, its fourth straight decline. July heating oil fell for the fifth day, losing 1.09 cents, to 46.47 cents a gallon.
The petroleum institute's weekly report on gasoline and crude stocks, released after the close of trading, showed crude stocks fell by about 4.4 million barrels, or 1.3 percent, while gasoline stocks rose by about 1 million barrels. Refinery utilization was little changed, at 95.1 percent.
"It's going to be real tough for crude to hold up if gas falls any further," said William Brown, president of W. H. Brown & Company consultants in New York.
Elsewhere, copper prices rose to an 18-month high amid perceptions that stockpiles will fall as Europe's economy gains strength. At the Commodity Exchange in New York, July copper surged 4.75 cents, to $1.0645 a pound, its highest since January 1993.
Western Germany's economy, Europe's largest, grew by five-tenths of 1 percent in the first three months of the year from the previous quarter, and rose 2.1 percent compared with a year ago.
Meanwhile, copper stockpiles in London Metal Exchange warehouses dropped almost 40 percent so far this year. Since Friday, copper stocks declined 3,700 metric tons, to 379,050 tons, a 14-month low.
"It's very much the demand side of the market" pushing copper higher, Michael Frawley, an analyst with Dean Witter in New York, said. "Demand is broad-based in Europe. I think people have failed to recognize that demand is not coming just from the U.S."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Prices Decline In a 'Healthy Setback'

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Treasury prices fell yesterday for the first time in five sessions even though there are increasing expectations that interest rates are headed lower this summer.
The bond market's decline was "a little healthy setback," said Bill Feezer, co-head of United States Government bond trading at Sanwa Securities (USA). The market had advanced 2.6 percent between May 31 and Monday. 
 Late yesterday, the Treasury's 30-year bond was down 12/32 of a point, or $3.75 per $1,000 bond. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 7.26 percent, from 7.21 percent on Monday.
The bond market's promising outlook derives mostly from evidence that the economy is not growing fast enough to generate a surge in inflation, traders and money managers said.
"People are more comfortable with the inflation scenario, more comfortable with the idea of a slowdown in demand" in consumer spending, Mr. Feezer said.
 
Late Selloff in Dollar Helps
 A late selloff in the dollar helped push bonds lower. The dollar fell 1.12 Japanese yen, to 104.17 yen, after the United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, said the United States was prepared to use trade laws to force Japan to open its markets. That threat caught many currency traders off guard, since it contrasted sharply with what had seemed a more conciliatory American stance toward Japan in recent weeks.
The dollar's decline in turn unnerved bond traders. "Ultimately, a weaker dollar is inflationary," said William Shea, head United States bond trader at the Nikko Securities Company International.
The two-year Treasury note's yield was unchanged at 5.76 percent. The note yielded 150 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, less than the 30-year bond, up four basis points from Monday.
As evidence mounts that the economy's growth rate is slowing, Treasury bond yields could fall to 7 percent or lower by the second half of the year, investors said.
"I figure the inflation rate won't be as onerous as people think it will be," said Warren Schmalenberger, director of fixed-income investments at Transamerica Fund Management, a Houston firm with $2.25 billion in bond mutual funds. "I am optimistic on bonds. I think that yields are going to come down."
The Federal Reserve has raised the rate on overnight bank lending rates four times this year. Now the central bank is inclined to watch how much growth slows, Mr. Schmalenberger said. "I think they pause here for the foreseeable future," he said.
So long as the Fed is not raising rates, bond yields are likely to fall, he said.
Meantime, inflation is not likely to accelerate because the Fed -- and the bond market -- will not let it, Mr. Schmalenberger said. This built-in brake on inflation will help drive yields down. Inflation erodes the value of fixed-income securities such as bonds.
"When you have a Fed that is concerned, and a market that's concerned, they will raise rates to where the economy slows" and inflation subsides, Mr. Schmalenberger said.
So far this year, 30-year Treasury bond yields have fluctuated between 7.66 percent, an 18-month high, and 6.30 percent, set before the Fed began raising rates in February. The record low yield is 5.77 percent, reached on Oct. 15.
Meantime, there is little evidence that the inflation rate is about to accelerate. Consumer prices rose 2.4 percent in the 12 months ended in April, down from 2.7 percent last year.
 
Some Traders Still Bearish
 Still, some traders remain bearish on the bond market. "Another two and a half points up doesn't change the trend," said Chris Madell, a trader at First Chicago Capital Markets. The four-day rally amounts to "false euphoria in a bear market, which is not to say we can't go higher near term."
But, he added, "I don't trust this thing for one second. I could be wrong, but if it's over, it will be one of the shortest bear markets in history."
Treasury bonds began falling in Asia in tandem with a rout in Japanese bonds. Declines there later spread to European bond markets.
Japanese Government bonds plunged as much as one point amid press reports that the Bank of Japan will end its monthlong policy of keeping money rates near historic lows. A Bank of Japan official denied the reports.
British bonds also fell one point amid expectations that European economies are rebounding.
Among other Treasury securities, the three-month bill fell two basis points to a discount rate of 4.11 percent. The six-month bill fell four basis points to a discount rate of 4.47 percent. And the one-year bill fell one basis point, to a discount rate of 4.86 percent.
The yield on three-year note rose to 6.09 percent from 6.07 percent. The yield on the five-year note rose to 6.51 percent from 6.49 percent. And the yield on the 10-year note rose to 6.94 percent from 6.90 percent.

HEADLINE: A Deal With Russia on Uranium Draws Protest From U.S. Industry

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
An unusual trade agreement in which the United States has tried to cement good relations with Russia and stabilize the Yeltsin Government is under siege. The uproar is a lesson in what happens when noble foreign-policy goals clash with rigid trade laws that were constructed to protect American industry.
The agreement, signed in March, allowed the Russians to export to the United States far more uranium fuel for nuclear power plants at a far lower price than would normally be allowed under American trade laws. At the same time it required that the Russians pay American uranium producers a subsidy to compensate for the falling price caused by the exports. 
 The deal has been praised by Jan Kalicki, the Commerce Department's ombudsman for trade with the Russian Federation, as "a model for future commercial relationships." But now it is bringing howls of protest from competing uranium exporters, notably Canada, Australia and Kazakhstan. And last week it was challenged in court by a coalition of American uranium producers and their union, who fear that most of the gravy will go not to them but to a single American company run by a wheeling-dealing Denver entrepreneur who helped frame the agreement.
What's more, Justice Department officials have raised eyebrows by refusing to declare in advance that sales will be legal under the antitrust laws. And many economists see the deal as a worrisome precedent in trading with the former socialist countries. "It's driving the Russians back to state control" by obligating uranium producers in Russia to negotiate export deals as a cartel, said Gary Hufbauer of the Institute for International Economics.
The Soviet Union began exporting uranium in large quantities in the late 1980's to help prop up its failing economy. In 1991 a handful of American producers of uranium and the labor union that represented their workers complained that the former Communist country was "dumping" uranium -- selling below the cost of production.
In October 1992 the Bush Administration negotiated a settlement with Russia and five other former Soviet republics that tied future sales of uranium in the United States to a sliding price scale: No uranium, beyond deliveries promised in earlier contracts, was to be sold unless the price of world market uranium reached $13 a pound. The $13 was far below the price that prevailed through most of the 1980's and roughly the cost of production for the most efficient American mines.
But contrary to expectations, that $13 threshold was never reached in 1993, so the former Soviet republics were not able to export uranium to the United States legally. And by late 1993 the beleaguered Yeltsin Government was pressing for a more liberal deal. The Russians even suggested that a failure to resolve the dumping case would threaten fulfillment of a separate agreement to sell to the United States 550 tons of highly enriched uranium, enough to make thousands of nuclear warheads, people close to the negotiations said.
 
Foreign Policy Goals
 When foreigners flood the American market with cheap commodities, Washington usually punishes the offenders with tariffs, or forces them to negotiate temporary import quotas. But when vital foreign policy goals, like stabilizing Russia, conflicted with American trade laws, the Commerce Department decided to turn the trade laws on their head.
With prodding from the State Department, Joseph Spetrini, then the Acting Deputy Secretary of Commerce, accepted radically different terms -- terms initially suggested by lawyers working for a trading and producing conglomerate, Concord, run by a Denver entrepreneur, Oren Benton. The conglomerate has worked closely with Russian uranium interests since Russia began exporting the commodity in 1988.
This amended agreement, signed in March, gave the Russians the right to export up to 42 million pounds to America over the next decade, roughly one-tenth of expected consumption by nuclear power plants. But there are strings: Every pound of Russian uranium must be matched with a newly mined pound of American uranium, and the blend must be sold to utilities for at least the prevailing market price.
The deal has another provision to accommodate the American producers. In effect, said Jagdish Bhagwati, an economist at Columbia University, the Russians are obligated to pay American producers not the prevailing market price -- what utilities pay for the uranium -- but rather what American producers would charge to supply the fuel. Say the utilities are paying $10 a pound, and the American producers want to charge $13. The utilities would pay $20 for the two-pound blend. The Russians would then pay the American producers $13 for their half of the blend, and keep the remaining $7.
 
Kazakh Treatment Cited
 But the arrangement seemed to meet Russia's demands, if not that of the other former Soviet republics. "I personally am disappointed and embarrassed by the way the United States has treated Kazakhstan," said Thomas Wilner, a lawyer at the firm of Shearman & Sterling, which represents the Kazakh Government.
Other unhappy parties are various uranium-exporting nations. Australia has protested to the Commerce Department, arguing that it violates America's obligations to trade fairly under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, a 109-nation group that oversees world trade. And Jean Dominique Ierachi, a spokesman for Canada's Ministry of External Affairs, said "the agreement is inconsistent with Nafta," the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Professor Bhagwati, a former adviser to the staff of GATT, said both countries had a case. "It's a backdoor subsidy for domestic uranium," he asserted.
The Justice Department has also reacted coolly. While Homer Moyer Jr., a partner in Miller, Chevalier, a law firm in Washington that represents Concord, argues that "there will be more competition in the uranium market with the agreement than without it," others worry that the matching requirement is an invitation to price collusion. "There are antitrust risks," said Diane Wood, a Deputy Assistant Attorney General. "We're monitoring the situation."
 
No Deals Struck
 So far, there has been nothing to monitor. In spite of the prospect of obtaining above-market prices, no American company has struck a matching deal with the Russians. Indeed, the reaction from domestic producers not associated with Concord has ranged from suspicious to overtly hostile.
Daniel Einbund, a vice president of a consulting firm called New York Nuclear, wondered whether the Russians were really in a position to offer matching terms that any American producer could accept. With the market price now around $9 a pound, the Russians would have to agree to settle for just $6 or $7. "How low will they go?" he asks.
Then, too, there is the problem of trust. A contract with a private uranium producer in Canada can be enforced in American and Canadian courts. Deals with Russia, which has neither assets to seize in America nor a reliable system to adjudicate disputes with foreigners, is a different matter.
Another troubling issue has been raised by economists, who say the arrangement just doesn't make sense. Indeed, it is against American interests to treat former socialist economies in transition as if nothing had changed, they say.
The initial assessment of dumping against the former Soviet republics was made under Commerce Department rules for "nonmarket economies," where local prices are assumed to offer no clue to actual production costs. That, Mr. Hufbauer said, gave the Commerce Department broad discretion to estimate that the republics' costs were extremely high and that therefore very high dumping penalties were called for -- not surprising from a Government agency that sees itself primarily as a protector of American industry.
 
Negative Effects Seen
 By effectively forcing the former Soviet republics to negotiate national quotas, said Thomas Neff, a political scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Washington is reinforcing the bureaucrats' control over production decisions -- "the very thing we are trying to change."
Professor Neff said the amended pact with the Russians not only drove control toward the old guard but encouraged Russia to export large quantities of uranium at very low prices. That may keep Russian miners employed, but it will also make the mines dependent on continuing Government subsidies to stay afloat. "We are encouraging inefficient production," he said.

HEADLINE: A Giant Restrained;
Superpower Obligations and Huge Deficits Tie U.S. Hands in Trade Talks With Japan

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 7

 BODY:
A top American trade official argues that the Japanese always have an edge in their negotiations with the United States for one simple reason: they get to practice "commerce," while the American side always has to practice "diplomacy."
Commerce is the art of the deal. It is practiced with a narrow lens, focused on one's own profits and competitive advantage. Diplomacy is the art of compromise. It is practiced with a wide-angle lens, focused on what is good not only for the nation's economy, but also for its global relationships. Commerce is about going for the jugular. Diplomacy is about holding hands. 
 These differences come to mind these days as the Clinton Administration lowers its expectations in its negotiations with Japan, from the pugnacious tone and policies with which it initially confronted Tokyo to the almost resigned "let's take what we can get and move on" approach now being pursued.
The "framework" negotiations, in which the Administration was looking for a package deal to open Japan's markets in automobiles, auto parts, telecommunications, medical equipment and insurance, will now be pursued piece by piece. Deals will be cut where they can be made, when they can be made. It is certainly better than nothing, but clearly not all that was hoped for.
Why the change? Because the United States simply does not have the influence to demand more. In effect, America cannot practice commerce with Japan. The giant has been "Gulliverized," tied down by two sets of ropes. One is the responsibilities that come from being an economic and political superpower, and the other is the limitations that come from having run up such huge Federal deficits and trade deficits over the years. Foreigners, particularly the Japanese, now hold billions of American dollars, greatly inhibiting what Washington can do to them.
In its heart, the Clinton Administration would love to go for Tokyo's jugular with the same single-mindedness with which Japan pursues its economic interests. But the United States' superpower legacy and its huge debt now make that virtually impossible. In the end, Washington seems doomed to diplomacy.
"We are still the country responsible for the global financial system, which we basically set up, and for global security," said Robert Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International. "It is a real constraint. Although Japan has the second-largest economy in the world, it has no such legacy. It has a much more national and regional focus and does not tend to worry about the implications for the global system."
Consider the last few months: When the Japanese dragged their feet in negotiations and the United States tried to punish them by pushing up the value of the yen -- so that all of Japan's exports would be more expensive -- world financial markets panicked and drove down the dollar even further, forcing Washington to back off. When the Japanese dragged their feet in negotiations and the American trade team wanted to play hardball, foreign policy advisers whispered in the President's ear that he could not afford a confrontation with Tokyo now, when its support was so crucial as Washington tried to deal with North Korea's nuclear threat.
 
 
Big Weapon: Treasury Notes
 When the Japanese dragged their feet and the United States threatened bilateral trade sanctions on Tokyo, Europeans and Asians howled that Washington was breaking the rules of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and undermining the global trading system it helped to establish. When the United States let the dollar fall to make exports to Japan cheaper, the Japanese started selling the billions of dollars of Treasury notes they had bought to help finance the American deficit, which forced up interest rates in this country.
And that is a real constraint. Put simply, the American economy now spends more than it can finance through domestic savings. To keep the economy growing, the United States must attract foreign savings from countries like Japan; otherwise the American economy will slow down. If Japanese investors are frightened by either the prospect of a trade war or a devaluing American currency, they will be less willing to buy the bonds, stocks and Treasury instruments that fuel the American economy. America can no longer have growth and a real get-tough Japan policy at the same time.
"It is our net debtor status, and our current account deficit, that imposes an inherent limitation on our freedom of action in international trade policy" vis-a-vis Japan, said John Lipsky, the chief economist at Salomon Brothers.
In other words, every time the Administration tries to bring leverage to bear on Japan, either the global interests of the United States or its global economic exposure forces Washington to hold back. Whenever the Clinton Administration tries to exercise pressure by pulling one lever or another, that lever comes off in its hand.
 
 
 
Possible Approaches
 What to do? Some argue that Washington should abandon the rancorous and energy-consuming effort to open specific Japanese markets and simply focus on getting Japan to stimulate its economy with tax cuts and Government spending, which would spur consumer demand for imports across the board. That is a less confrontational approach, and there are allies for it in Japan.
Others, like Joe Massey, a former top Bush Administration trade official, argue for shifting the emphasis in negotiations away from the Japanese Government, where little leverage can be brought to bear, to negotiating instead directly with Japanese businesses. Individually, they are much more vulnerable to American threats, from anti-dumping suits to antitrust suits.
"What we need to do is shift our focus to the Japanese private-sector companies which are the actual marketplace for our goods," Mr. Massey said. "The formal Government barriers are not that important any more. It is the informal barriers that are important -- the relationships between Japanese suppliers -- and we have to break into that."

HEADLINE: Speaker Vallone's Opportunity

 BODY:
The New York City Council has no more vehement champion than Peter Vallone, its Speaker since 1986. He never hesitates to point out that the revised City Charter has given the Council more muscle. Now -- city budget time -- is his moment to prove it.
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's budget for the year that starts July 1 heads the Council's agenda. At issue is his proposal for deep cuts in social service agency funds, while he refuses to seek similar cuts in the police and fire departments. 
 As a Democratic Council member from a middle-class district in Queens, Mr. Vallone says his ideology and the Republican Mayor's are not very different. But as Speaker, he is leader of the entire Council and represents a broader constituency.
Budget negotiations are under way, aimed toward passage in the next few weeks. These negotiations have extra significance in establishing the Council's authority because this budget is a new Mayor's first thrust, and because the Council, with a heavily Democratic majority, faces a Republican Mayor for the first time.
Mainstream Democrats are furious, and properly so, over proposed social service cuts, particularly in services for children and teen-agers, while Mr. Giuliani's political backers in the uniformed forces are left untouched. Balance is essential. There must be belt-tightening everywhere, including social services, but also including safe, reasonable economies in the police and fire departments.
The Mayor insists the uniformed forces cannot be cut because the state aid for their agencies sets specific requirements, including a specific head count for police. Here lies the Speaker's opportunity to exercise the power he claims for the Council.
Mr. Vallone strongly supported the state legislation that pays for more city police and firefighters. But the legislation has a basic flaw; it focuses on total numbers of uniformed personnel, whether they are deskbound or out on the street.
The Mayor and Council should look instead to patrol strength. Analyses by the Citizens Budget Commission, a private group, have shown that enforcement can be strengthened while hiring fewer new police officers -- for example, by hiring lower-paid civilians to handle duties that do not require a uniformed officer.
Reduction in the uniformed force would require an O.K. from Albany. Mr. Giuliani shows no inclination to seek it, and his people say the Legislature would not approve if he did. But nothing ventured, nothing gained.
Mr. Vallone has undisputed control over the members of the Council's Democratic majority. If he opts for a showdown with the Mayor on the police-fire issue, he and the Council might prevail. If he chooses instead to let members just tinker with projects that please their constituents, he will lessen the Council's clout.

HEADLINE: In America;
The Job-Killer Policy

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
To anyone who has grown up with the deeply American belief that the best way to get ahead is to roll up your sleeves and get to work, it must seem peculiar that the Clinton Administration has adopted a policy that deliberately puts a brake on the economy, and thus on the number of Americans who can work.
The Administration, genuflecting before the Federal Reserve, is now more concerned with inflation than with the chronically high unemployment that is eroding the promise of the American dream for millions of men and women. 
 But what inflation? Nobody can find the inflation. Having run from so many other battles, the Administration is now engaged in a fight to the death with a phantom. It's a fight that pleases the wealthy but has painful consequences for ordinary working men and women, and for the poor.
Stephen Blackwell, a supervisor with the State Department of Labor in New York, mentioned the discouragement he continues to see in the faces of the working poor as they sign up for unemployment benefits and job search assistance. "We hear that things are getting better," said Mr. Blackwell, "but our gut reaction is that things haven't substantially improved."
Mr. Blackwell has worked in the same Manhattan office for 30 years and knows many of the clients personally. "You now see people accepting jobs that pay much less than jobs they would have accepted years ago. At some point it gets to be an emotional thing for me. I see people that I've known for years who are now struggling; people who are hard workers just like me, maybe harder."
The decision to sacrifice the livelihoods of real people to placate the evil spirit of inflation has enormous consequences, most of them bad. A lack of meaningful work is at the core of nearly all the social problems plaguing the country. You cannot gather up the pieces and begin to repair the damage we have done to families without finding a way to create many more jobs. You cannot achieve meaningful welfare reform, or universal health coverage, without a growing market for labor. And you sure can't make any real headway on crime without putting vast numbers of young people to work.
But we are not moving in that direction. The outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas reported yesterday that work-force reductions through May were running 18 percent ahead of the first five months of 1993. While there are jobs being created (many of them temporary or part time), corporate downsizing continues at a rapid, perhaps record-breaking rate. There are vast regions of the work force that have yet to be reached by the economic recovery, and they won't be reached as long as the brakes are kept on expansion.
Joseph Kneafsey, who manages Mr. Blackwell's office, says he is seeing professionals who are "a job away" from their specialties. An example would be a senior programmer who loses a job, cannot find other work in the field, manages to land a job as a bookkeeper, and then loses that job.
Mr. Kneafsey was asked, in light of official statistics showing decreasing unemployment, if he was seeing any improvement at all. After a long pause he replied, "Very limited."
If the country is not yet strong enough economically to have nearly full employment for the middle class, how will it be possible to get decent jobs to the working poor, and beyond them to the hard-core unemployed?
"You can't at this level of growth in the economy," said Jeff Faux, president of the Economic Policy Institute in Washington. In Mr. Faux's view, the argument that you have to sacrifice jobs to keep inflation under control is a specious one, given current economic conditions.
Mr. Faux noted that over the last 80 years, the period for which price indices are available, the United States has never experienced runaway inflation that resulted from a peacetime economy surging out of control. "In our actual experience," he said, "the dreaded wage-price spiral has only occurred when markets have been suddenly jolted by war or supply shocks, such as occurred with the oil embargoes."
The inflation rate is a shade under 3 percent, yet the Federal Reserve remains mesmerized. As for out-of-work Americans -- well, too bad about them.

HEADLINE: Foreign Policy: A Fresh Start

 BODY:
The long D-Day weekend celebrating unity of purpose, commemorating individual acts of bravery and recalling the eventual triumph of good over evil lifted spirits on both sides of the Atlantic and allowed President Clinton to float, at least momentarily, above the foreign policy frustrations that have plagued his first 17 months.
If only today's foreign policy agenda lent itself to such clarity and back-to-the-wall heroism. But the challenges of 1994 are less cataclysmic -- and far more ambiguous -- than those of 1944. And when the President tried, in his speech to the French National Assembly yesterday, to summon some of that D-Day spirit to address present European challenges, the exercise looked strained. 
 The goals Mr. Clinton articulated were worthy: expand democracy, integrate the economies of Eastern and Western Europe, develop a system of cooperative security with the former Warsaw Pact, try to contain and calm the Bosnian conflict. But where the weekend's commemorative speeches rang with purpose and personal engagement, yesterday's policy address had all the passion of a political science text.
Yet Mr. Clinton still has a rare chance to refocus his Administration's foreign policy, clarifying America's role in the world and improving day-to-day execution. The President's careful preparations for this trip and his immersion in recent European history have given him new confidence in foreign affairs and perhaps a new appreciation of its significance for his Presidency. And his creditable performance has won respect at home and abroad. It is a valuable moment in his Presidency, a chance for a fresh foreign policy start. He should make the most of it.
One lesson the President seems to have learned recently is that a big power like the United States cannot easily abstain from major global crises. Given America's global engagement during the half-century from Pearl Harbor to the collapse of the Soviet Union, even a decision not to intervene in a place like Bosnia becomes a form of intervention.
Yet Mr. Clinton has always understood that Washington cannot continue to assume all the global responsibilities that came with the cold war. Rightly, he wants his Presidency to be known for its domestic accomplishments. Belatedly, he is coming to understand that a reputation for foreign policy fecklessness can undermine domestic credibility.
Mr. Clinton's biggest problem has been the unresolved conflict between a globalist rhetorical agenda that seems to invite U.S. involvement everywhere and day-to-day decision-making that seems to permit it nowhere. Compounding this has been the President's reluctance to appear personally engaged in his own Administration's foreign policy.
Mr. Clinton succeeded so well in Europe this week because he finally did step into the role of national leader and Commander in Chief. He needs to build on that success by speaking out more often and more effectively on foreign policy issues, abandoning academic abstractions for the kind of strong personal imagery he used in the cemeteries and battle sites of Europe.
And he needs to close the gap between rhetoric and practice by making firm choices among competing priorities.
In an era of reduced danger, no abstract set of rules can determine when the U.S. should involve its forces in a foreign crisis. Washington should not try to manage the world. It should be clear about the differences between localized crises, however intense, and strategic challenges, like the future of Russia, China and Mexico. It should mainly look out for American interests, including the defense of allies and the promotion of American values.
Presidents rarely get the chance to change course in foreign policy without a disastrous loss of credibility. Mr. Clinton has such a chance now.

HEADLINE: Australia Doesn't Wink at East Timor Abuses

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Timorous on Timor," your egregious May 24 editorial, gravely misrepresents Australia's position on East Timor. Although Australia has recognized the sovereign authority of Indonesia over East Timor since February 1979, our public concerns and representations over violations of human rights in the region are well-documented. Recognition of Indonesia's sovereign authority in no way implies approval of the circumstances of the Indonesian acquisition of East Timor. 
 Far from "meekly refusing to challenge Indonesia" as you state, Australia raises its concerns with the Indonesian Government with committed persistence. We have been unswerving in our call for a process of reconciliation in East Timor, which would involve economic development sensitive to the needs of the East Timorese and a major reduction in military presence. This is understood by the Indonesians.
Australia supported the 1993 resolution of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights critical of the human rights situation in East Timor. This year Australia joined the commission's consensus adoption of the chairman's statement on human rights in East Timor.
On a practical level, Australian diplomats, official delegations (some parliamentary) and journalists visit East Timor regularly, and the issue stays prominent in Australia.
Despite difficulties and obstructions, Australia delivers development assistance specifically to East Timor, including funds to improve water supplies and sanitation, donations to the United Nations Children's Fund project and the Red Cross.
Your bizarre suggestion that Australian diplomats avoid using the words East Timor for fear of offending Indonesia is simply fanciful. We use the terminology "East Timor" bilaterally and in global forums, as anyone who follows the debate would know. I might note that your own editorial languished under a headline in which the "East" had been lost from Timor.

HEADLINE: The Trouble With a Bull Run Theme Park

 BODY:
To the Editor:
William Safire betrays misunderstanding in "Third Manassas" (column, May 26) of opposition to Disney's proposed development in Virginia. The issue is the site, in some of America's most beautiful and historic countryside. Opponents would welcome the theme park closer to Washington, where it could be served by public transportation, thus eliminating the air pollution of adding 77,000 car trips a day to a gridlocked Interstate 66. 
 A site closer to Washington would also provide jobs to people who need them. The unemployment rate in rural Prince William County has been less than 3 percent for a decade, a figure most public officials can only dream about. The Washington unemployed figure is much higher.
Historians don't really care if Disney is interested in American history. The issue is, rather, should Disney create massive urban sprawl with a megadevelopment in rural Virginia and desecrate historic Civil War battlefields -- battlefields where thousands of Americans died in our bloodiest conflict and which are the legacy of all Americans.
The sprawl, air pollution, traffic congestion and water pollution the development will generate throughout Northern Virginia, the District and the Maryland suburbs are unwelcome to most residents, not just the historians and other "elites" Mr. Safire sneers at.

Variations on Odysseus In a Play From Britain
Ohio Theater
"Waiting at the Water's Edge," a play by Lucinda Coxon, both celebrates and demands patience. This fablelike tale is as fat, leisurely and dense with social detail as a novel from the early 20th century, the period in which it is set. 
 Indeed, the British play initially seems as conventional as an Edwardian slice-of-life series on PBS, as it carefully sets up the contrasting characters of Vi (Isabel Keating), a restive miner's daughter, and the more domestic Su (Patricia Scanlon), both servants to an isolated, imperious woman (Sharon Laughlin) in coastal Wales.
For a while, all goes according to class-conscious British formula: Su wrestles with the humiliations of a maid's life; Vi begins a relationship with her employer's brow-beaten son, Will (gracefully played by Simon Brooking). When a violent accident forces Vi to escape to Canada disguised as a man, the play shifts disjunctively from naturalism to magical realism. And Vi, aided by a ghost, metamorphoses into a tyrannical mining executive.
Vi and Su suggest variations on Odysseus and Penelope: the nomadic adventurer and the virtuous woman who waits. In making both characters female, Ms. Coxon ingeniously subverts myth to explore economic and sexual identity. But she is more skilled in establishing themes than in working them out. The drama's second act is often ungainly and reductionist, particularly in unfolding the social motives of Vi's revenge.
Nela Wagman's efficient, simple staging, ballasted by lucid performances, doesn't transcend the play's limitations. But it highlights Ms. Coxon's undeniable gifts for building narrative and, in examining forms of loneliness and ambition, for fluidly forging connections between social cause and emotional effect.
The play, a Watermark Theater production, is at the Ohio Theater, 66 Wooster Street, SoHo. BEN BRANTLEY

HEADLINE: LEADERS IN ALBANY FINALLY ANNOUNCE A BUDGET ACCORD

BYLINE: By IAN FISHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ALBANY, June 7

 BODY:
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and legislative leaders said tonight that they had finally cobbled together the last details of the $34 billion state budget in a deal that reflected both the revival of New York State's fiscal health and the political needs of a difficult election year.
Sixty-eight days after the legal deadline passed, Mr. Cuomo and the leaders of the State Senate and the Assembly had reached agreement on one last issue: exactly how much the state would increase assistance to schools and local governments. Lawmakers returned to the session late tonight to begin debating the package, and were expected to finish voting early Wednesday. 
 "Frankly I think it's done," Mr. Cuomo said after he and legislative leaders resolved a dispute today over $30 million that had threatened to delay the budget further.
Final numbers were not available, but the budget, leavened with a $1.5 billion surplus, was expected to contain the largest spending increase since the recession, which hit New York State especially hard, began five years ago.
The budget was also a candidly political document, spreading road projects and sports arena repairs around the state and increasing school assistance to virtually all 718 school districts this election year. [News analysis, page B4.]
Lawmakers had already reviewed agreements on tax cuts, fingerprinting for welfare recipients and capital spending. Today they reviewed agreements on local spending, a limited state takeover of county governments' Medicaid costs and a plan to reorganize, and in some ways restrict, how the state borrows and plans for expensive capital projects.
Local governments would receive a total increase of $147 million this year in aid for health care costs for the poor, educating disabled students and other unrestricted aid. For all types of aid, New York City would receive significantly more than the $275 million that Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani requested to help close a projected $2.3 billion budget gap.
Estimates of the city's share varied from about $300 million to $418 million. Robert M. Harding, the city's lobbyist in Albany, called the estimates "good news."
"From everything we're been told by the leaders, this budget will give us in excess of $275 million," he said.
But Mr. Giuliani said today at City Hall, before the budget numbers were released, that the outcome for the city was still uncertain because of a bill the Legislature passed on Monday requiring the city to spend a set amount of state aid on students, not on balancing its budget.
"Essentially, what this law does is memorialize the present way in which the money is being allocated in the school system, which is really terrible," he said.
Legislative aides, however, gave the bill a dim chance for survival, and Mr. Cuomo has yet to say whether he will sign the bill into law.
School districts would receive $550 million in added aid for the coming school year, a 6 percent increase to a total of $9.68 billion. Of that total, New York City would receive an increase of $265 million in the coming school year, an increase of about 8 percent, to a total of $3.38 billion.
The budget's outlines were disclosed days ago. But the Legislature was prepared to vote on the final plan only hours after details were disclosed on $150 million in so-called legislative initiatives and member items, virtually closing off public scrutiny of those most sensitive projects. That spending goes to pet local projects of individual legislators, and one-third of the spending is never itemized in the final budget.
Only one budget fight has dragged on longer: in 1991 the Legislature adopted its final plan on July 4.
 
Praise From Cuomo
 Mr. Cuomo praised the final deal, which more than doubled the $210 million in tax cuts he proposed in January, saying it showed a state on its way to economic strength. "It is clear that we have resumed the voyage toward a stronger and better New York," he said.
The Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino, Republican of Oyster Bay, sought to take credit tonight for the tax cuts, mostly for businesses, projected to be worth between $450 million and $476 million this year and $1.7 billion when fully in effect.
"The tax cut package in this budget is the blueprint for a new beginning and partnership with the business community and the renewal of our commitment to provide jobs and a better future for all New Yorkers," Mr. Marino said in a statement.
Aside from state assistance to schools and local governments, the leaders announced agreement on a debt reform proposal today that was praised by both State Comptroller H. Carl McCall and the Citizens Budget Commission, a private advocacy group supported by businesses.
The bill, pushed strongly by Mr. Cuomo as a way to improve the state's low bond ratings, would end almost all forms of backdoor borrowing -- essentially loans that the state takes out without voter approval.
Under existing law, all state borrowing is supposed to be approved by voter referendum, but in fact lawmakers have resorted to a variety of techniques to avoid such public scrutiny. In 1990, for example, the state transferred ownership of Attica state prison to a public authority as collateral for a $200 million bond issue.
 
A Set Percentage
 The new bill would for the first time allow the Legislature to approve bond issues directly, without a voter referendum, but would limit such borrowing to a set percentage tied to the total personal income of the state's residents. It would also require the Governor to submit a detailed list of expected capital projects and their costs each year.
The bill was introduced as a constitutional amendment and requires the approval of two consecutively elected legislatures, followed by voter approval.
"The state has relied on expensive and unacceptable backdoor financing and fiscal gimmicks for too long," said Mr. McCall, who helped draft the package. The bill, he said, "will bring real change to the process."
On one major issue, the cost of the Medicaid program of health care for the poor, the new budget included some modest help to local governments, which have been complaining loudly about high costs. Mayor Giuliani and county leaders lobbied heavily for the state to take over their share of the costs, but in the end the budget called for a two-year plan for the state to assume a fraction of the counties' $3.2 billion share of the $22 billion program.
This year the budget calls for an increase of $48.9 million to local governments to pay for long-term and managed care costs. New York City's share would be $31.5 million, and roughly double the sum next year. The state already pays about 80 percent of the local share of these costs.
The state currently pays 34 percent of the total Medicaid program, or $7.5 billion, and the Federal Government picks up the rest, or $14.5 billion.
 
'Underlying Problem'
 While grateful for any extra aid, John R. Zagame, executive director of the New York State Association of Counties, likened the deal to "rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic."
"Never has so much time been wasted by so many on so little without addressing the most pressing, critical, underlying problem the state faces -- which is how to address out-of-control Medicaid costs," he said.
The state will also pick up $118 million over two years for a program that prepares handicapped preschoolers to attend regular classes. The state will ultimately pay for 39 percent. New York City's share would be $12.6 million this year.
Two other items related to medical care were included, both of which became the source of fierce haggling near the end of the negotiations.
The Assembly won a program to expand a health insurance program to an additional 24,000 children of low-income parents not eligible for Medicaid. The program currently covers children 12 years of age and under. With the new plan, it would include 13-year-olds this year and 14-year-olds next year. This year the plan would cost an additional $5 million.
 
Help for Hospitals
 The Senate won a program to assist hospitals by allowing them to increase the rate they charge to insurers in a one-year aid package worth $95 million. The package, which would cost the state $13.8 million, would benefit virtually all of the state's 268 hospitals.
The state's legislative budget, which pays for staff, supplies and other expenses, was set to increase about 5.8 percent over last year for a total of $177 million.
And closing a long chapter of lobbying from Brooklyn, the budget also provides $1.3 million to change Medgar Evers College from a two-year to a four-year institution. The change would take place July 1.
