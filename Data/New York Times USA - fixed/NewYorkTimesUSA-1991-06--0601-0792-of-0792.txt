Rates Down, Offerings Up in One Note Category

BYLINE: By DIANA B. HENRIQUES

 BODY:
The arcane market for asset-backed securities is popping with new issues, according to Clifton Lewis, an analyst at the Capital Markets Assurance Corporation, a bond insurer based in New York.
Asset-backed securities are notes secured by pools of consumer loans, most commonly those made to shoppers who carry an unpaid credit-card balance. Issuance may be up because interest rates on asset-backed issues are down, ranging between 90 and 125 basis points above comparable Treasury notes, Mr. Lewis said. 
 In May, a record of more than $6.6 billion in new asset-backed issues came to market, more than twice the amount sold in the like month last year. That eclipsed the previous one-month record of $6.3 billion, set last June. New entries in the first five months of this year total $19.1 billion, also a record level and 40 percent higher than the amount sold in the corresponding period of 1990. With the books on June still open, $4 billion in new notes have been sold, twice what was expected, Mr. Lewis said.

HEADLINE: The Executive Computer;
Looking Beyond Innovation, an Award for Results

BYLINE: By Peter H. Lewis

 BODY:
It is one thing to look at new technologies, and quite another to look at how the technologies are put to use to improve business productivity. A hammer and chisel are far less interesting than the marble statues created with them; computers and software are simply fancier tools used to create elegant business systems.
Elegant in the sense, for example, of delivering the chips (potato variety) on time. Or making a better plug faster. Or delivering the news in four languages. Last week, these were among the star performances being honored in the annual ceremonies held by Computerworld, a magazine published by the International Data Group Inc., of Framingham, Mass., and the Smithsonian Institution in Washington. 
 Frito-Lay Inc., the $4.9 billion snack-food division of Pepsico Inc. that is based in Plano, Tex., took the prize in the category of business and related services for its work with handheld computers. The company's 10,000 sales representatives use them to sell more than 100 different brand-name products to more than 400,000 retail stores.
Using the bricklike Fujitsu computer, which replaced conventional paper forms, each route representative can send detailed sales and inventory information back to Frito-Lay headquarters each day. The computers keep track of prices, special promotions for each store, information on stale or returned products and other details. A printer in each delivery truck allows the sales representative to give the store manager a comprehensive receipt and invoice.
At the end of each day, instead of spreading paper receipts on the kitchen table and reaching for the calculator, pencil and aspirin, the sales representative simply hooks the Fujitsu to a telephone and sends the data to Frito-Lay's headquarters. The data are collected, compiled and distilled. "We pick up every sale of every bag made to every customer every day," said Charles S. Feld, vice president of management information services for Frito-Lay. This information is then relayed to Frito-Lay's manufacturing and distribution centers as a "real-time" inventory system.
"The result is that we can keep fresh products moving through the system continuously," Mr. Feld said. "Having the right product in the right place at the right time is really critical to us." The daily sales data are also used to develop market strategies.
The Fujitsu computers were chosen for their ruggedness, Mr. Feld said, having proved out with minimal failure rates since the program began to be implemented in 1988. On average, they operate for three years without a failure, even though dropped, jostled and used in temperatures ranging from the 40 degrees below zero of a Wyoming winter to the 120 degrees of an Arizona summer.
 The company spends about $2,500 to equip each of the 10,000 route salespeople with the Fujitsu computer and a printer for the delivery truck. And Mr. Feld and his team spent more than 18 months developing the software for the central system and for the system that returns the information to manufacturing and distribution centers.
 Even so, Mr. Feld said, the system "paid for itself well within a year, and it has paid for itself more than once." A Frito-Lay spokesman said the company saved more than $40 million in its first year from reduced paperwork, reduced losses from stale products and route consolidation.
Mr. Feld said the company was now investigating systems that would hook directly into a customer's computer, handling accounts payable and receivables, and allowing store managers to assess which Frito-Lay products are most profitable.
 The Computerworld-Smithsonian manufacturing award went to Raychem-Advanter, a division of the Raychem Corporation that is based in Richmond, British Columbia. Raychem-Advanter manufactures highly specialized electronic adapters and connectors that are used principally by the aerospace and military electronics industries. "At the simplest level they're basically electric plugs, but with more than a million variable components," a company spokesman said by way of explanation.
 "We wanted to create a state-of-the-art facility for creating these exotic plugs, which are made primarily of metal," said Raychem's Bill Mitchell, senior vice president for electronics. In the past, he said, Raychem often turned to outside machine shops for the parts. The company sometimes had to wait weeks or months for the parts and was not always satisfied with the quality.
So Raychem created Raychem-Advanter, designed around a computer-integrated manufacturing, or C.I.M., system, that uses Sparcstation computers made by Sun Microsystems Inc. of Mountain View, Calif. The system distributes information to everyone in the 35-person manufacturing setup, from managers to machine operators. This allows decisions to be made faster and easier, the company says.
 "Everything is now controlled by the computers, including incoming orders and manufacturing orders, product design, factory scheduling, quality control, the documentation, and so on," Mr. Mitchell said. And the company believes that the results have been striking.
 "Quality is extraordinarily superb," Mr. Mitchell said. "At a typical outside shop we might have been quoted a 26-week lead time. Now we typically turn things around in two days or less. In the older shop, it took 4 to 8 hours to set up machines to run a few parts, with actual manufacturing time of about 20 minutes. It's been an absolutely fundamental breakthrough for our business."
Unlike the Frito-Lay system, the Raychem-Advanter system has not yet been a financial success, largely because the military and the aerospace industries have sharply curtailed spending. Even so, Mr. Mitchell said, Raychem believes it has taken a major step toward developing a model for all its manufacturing.
Then there's making-do. The Tenderloin Times, a nonprofit newspaper in the Tenderloin district of San Francisco, uses donated Apple Macintosh computers, a laser printer and basic desktop publishing software to create what it says is the country's only four-language newspaper. The Times, which serves the neighborhood's large population of Southeast Asian immigrants, beat out such corporate giants as Capital Cities/ABC and Thames Television of England to claim the media, arts and entertainment award.
 Times stories are written in English, translated, and then re-entered and printed using Vietnamese, Lao and Cambodian word processing programs. Until The Times got its computers, the Asian languages section was laboriously written by hand. Elizabeth Price, the paper's business manager, said the editors were now hoping for the donation of a laser printer able to print on standard tabloid sized 11-inch by 17-inch paper.

HEADLINE: All About/Weddings;
It's One Party Even the Recession Can't Spoil

BYLINE: By RACHEL POWELL

 BODY:
When Shannon and Gregg Scott of San Diego got married in May, it was not the best time to spend $25,000 on a wedding. She is an interior decorator, he a construction executive, and business was not exactly booming. Though both sets of parents helped out, the couple still spent most of their savings on an elegant wedding ceremony and reception for 240 guests.
"If times were to get worse for us, we wouldn't have our cushion," said Ms. Scott, who is 25. "But even from a money perspective I don't regret what we spent at all. We did things exactly the way we always dreamed they would be." 
 The Scotts' approach was typical of the American way of marriage. Weddings are marketed as the event of a lifetime. Although couples are more careful with their money these days, they are still spending nearly as much as they did before the recession began.
In 1990, more than 2.4 million couples tied the knot. Bride's magazine, the most widely read publication in the field, estimates that for its readers -- generally middle class and upper middle class -- the average wedding cost, including honeymoon, is more than $19,000. Bride's, published by Conde Nast, also estimates that the total wedding market reached $32 billion last year, once the honeymoon and gifts were figured in.
"This market is so steady, so solid, so consistent. It's like death and taxes, only much more fun," said William Bondlow, the publisher of Globe Communications's Bridal Guide.
The most encouraging trend in the eyes of the industry is that large, expensive formal weddings remain fashionable, even as the homespun 1990's replace the glitzy 1980's. A recent survey of 2,000 readers of Modern Bride, published by Reed Publishing USA, another magazine aimed at those on the wedding track, found that 59 percent were planning formal black-tie affairs.

 
 
Magazines for Advice
Prime Ad Season Is December to June

The most efficient way for retailers and service providers to reach marriage-bound people is through the bridal magazines. The three mentioned above dominate the market, although some regional publications are popular as well.
The circulation and advertising of these publications vary over the course of the year. Overall, Bride's circulation averages 370,000 a year; Modern Bride is at about 300,000, and Bridal Guide is at 240,000. But December through May is the prime season, since 50 percent of all weddings take place in the spring and summer. June is still the biggest month, followed by August.
The recession-related drop-off in advertising spending that has affected the magazine business in general has hurt the bridal magazines, but only minimally.
Between January and April, the Publishers Information Bureau reported that Bride's saw advertising revenues rise a scant 1 percent over 1990, to $23.1 million, while Modern Bride's revenues dropped 2.4 percent, to $16.6 million. The organization does not follow Bridal Guide, a relative newcomer to the field, but Mr. Bondlow said advertising revenues are ahead of last year.
"The recession has certainly slowed things. It has proved that the bridal industry is not totally recession-proof," said Mr. Bondlow. But he and others characterized the economic damage as temporary and light.
"Businesses indigenous to the bridal market such as home furnishings, apparel and travel rely on us as a way to do business," said Howard Friedberg, publisher of Modern Bride. "While those industries may be affected by the recession, the bridal magazines are the last place that they want to cut advertising."

 
 
The Dress
It's Still White, Satin and Expensive
 Not surprisingly, clothes for the bridal party are one of the single biggest wedding expenditures. Although no exact figures are available, of the $16.4 billion spent on wedding ceremonies last year, a sizable portion was for apparel for the wedding party.
Though wedding mini-dresses are becoming more common in advertising layouts, most brides are still wearing the quintessential floor-length white satin gown. According to a Bride's readers' survey, the average cost of a wedding dress and veil was $960 last year, with prices varying widely depending on the style, designer and amount of alteration necessary for a custom fit.
"They absolutely do not want to skimp on their gowns," said Deborah Harding, editor of Bridal Guide. "The dress is one of the highest priorities."
But some skimping does take place, most of it probably at the reception. Guest lists remain long, but menus can be scaled down.
"People aren't necessarily cutting their budgets, but they're looking at their finances more carefully," said Marcy Blum, a wedding consultant in New York. "A reception for 250 guests might become a four-hour cocktail party rather than a sit-down dinner with five courses." Catering costs for a sit-down dinner average $150 a person in major cities, while cocktails and hors d'oeuvres cost just $50 a person.
"The most important thing that the recession has brought is that people are looking for value. They are more likely to shop carefully," said Barbara Tober, editor of Bride's.

 
 
Honeymooners
One Bright Spot For Travel
 The recession-resistance of the wedding business may, in fact, have helped to shore up at least one sagging industry. Although travel in general has suffered in the last nine months, honeymooners have apparently kept their plans intact.
"The recession has had no effect on our honeymoon business. It's as good or better than last year," said Steven Heydt, a senior vice president in charge of marketing at Liberty Travel, a privately owned chain of 168 travel agencies.
Modern Bride estimates the honeymoon market at $3 billion a year, with Hawaii and the Caribbean the destinations of choice. "The honeymoon is not a cheap sale," said Mr. Heydt. They will demand the cheapest air fare, he added, but "they want deluxe hotels and the best rooms."
Cheap air fare or not, Bride's readers said they still spent an average of $3,200 on the vacation of a lifetime.
"It is a pie that is lucrative and important. The honeymoon business is far more reliable than business or meeting travel." said Mr. Friedberg of Modern Bride.
Modern Bride has recently entered into a deal with American Express Vacations, agreeing to produce vacation guides offering special travel packages in the magazine every six months for the next three years. The magazine expects to reap more than $1 million a year from the arrangement.

 
 
MANY MORE PLACES TO REGISTER

Although department stores still have the best-known bridal registries, many other kinds of stores have entered the market. New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art, for example, has found its bridal registry, in existence since 1980, to be a tidy source of income. Other businesses from sporting goods stores to art galleries have tried the tactic as a way to guarantee sales.
"In the last year or so, the business has grown," said Judith Block, manager of the museum's registry. "It's not our main source of income, but it's still a nice piece of change.
Ms. Block said original china and glassware are still the best sellers, but that couples are also registering for art books and other items at the museum's shop.
The average wedding guest spends $67 on a wedding present, according to a survey of Modern Bride readers. And an increasing number of couples said they planned to register for non-traditional items like VCR's.
And Janice Hartoch, a development officer for the University of California at Santa Barbara, plans to register at a wine store. "My fiance made a special request," she explained.
The concept does not seem to work everywhere. Liberty Travel started a registry two years ago at its 168 agencies.
"The idea was to set up a program like Bloomingdale's or Macy's, because we believe the honeymoon is the new couple's single biggest purchase other than furniture or fixtures for their home," said Steven Heydt, a senior vice president in charge of marketing for Liberty Travel.
The response, however, was less than enthusiastic. "They wanted a little more privacy in the transaction than we anticipated," said Mr. Heydt.

HEADLINE: What Really Hurt Natural Gas

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Bottom-Fishing in the Gas Patch" (May 19), Thomas C. Hayes overlooked the primary cause of the surplus of natural gas deliverability in the United States. 
 The severe natural gas shortage of the mid-1970's occurred because Federal price controls on natural gas depressed producers' economic returns to the point where the risk/reward ratio was inadequate to justify the new investment required. That shortage was a watershed.
 Congress passed the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, designed to provide incentives for producers to invest in new drilling by replacing the old price controls with a system of escalating ceiling prices. By the date of the program's enactment, more than 80 percent of Midwestern and Northeastern industrial gas consumers had installed dual-fuel capability, thus setting the stage for serious gas-oil competition at the plant gate.
Pipeline companies, eager to lock up new supplies, rushed to producers' doors to offer long-term purchase agreements providing maximum ceiling prices allowable. Since ceiling prices placed a cap on price-based bidding, pipelines competed for new supply contracts by bidding up the percentage of the contract quantities that they would pay for even if they could not take the gas.
Thus encouraged by Congress and their pipeline customers, natural gas producers quickly met the demands of the marketplace. The higher prices, however, drove the fuel-switchable industrial consumer away from natural gas.
The net effect was that an oversupply of natural gas deliverability occurred by the early 1980's and market prices fell below the ceiling prices. Pipeline companies unilaterally abrogated their contracts rather than absorb the losses. Most natural gas producers were left holding the bag. Mild winters during recent years have not helped to work off the oversupply.
Hopefully, when the natural gas market ultimately achieves equilibrium, Congress will remember these lessons and avoid the temptation to re-regulate pricing.

HEADLINE: U.N. Index on Freedom Enrages Third World

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, June 21

 BODY:
The publication by a United Nations agency of a new index showing that the world's poorest nations are generally also the least free has provoked a storm of outrage among third-world countries.
The storm erupted here this month at a meeting of the governing council of the United Nations Development Program, an independent agency through which the world's richer countries last year channeled some $1.4 billion in technical assistance to the third world. 
 The controversy centers on the agency's second-annual Human Development Report, which was issued last month and for the first time contained a "human freedom index" ranking 88 countries according to the degree of freedom their citizens enjoy.
The index, which is based on a study made in the mid-1980's by Charles Humana, a British academic, of adherence to various human-rights treaties and conventions, classes Sweden as the world's freest country, with 38 of a possible 40 points, and Iraq as the least free, with a score of zero.
But it also indicates that most of the world's poorest countries, including China, Zaire, Bangladesh, Tanzania, Liberia and Kenya, have little freedom, scoring 10 points or fewer. Thirty-two countries, including India, Egypt, Nigeria and Mexico, enjoy only a medium level of freedom, with scores between 11 and 30.
Those with high freedom scores, between 31 and 40, are all industrialized countries except for Costa Rica. The United States occupies 13th place with a score of 33.
The report, prepared by a distinguished Pakistani economist, Mahbub ul-Haq, who has also served as his country's Finance Minister, concludes that "over all there seems to be a high correlation between human development and human freedom."
 The report argues that in some cases "political freedom seems to have unleashed the creative energies of the people -- and lead to ever higher levels of income and social progress."
Spokesmen for third-world countries have strenuously criticized the human-freedom index, calling it inaccurate, a waste of money, interference in their internal affairs and irrelevant to their development needs.
Many also expressed fears that it would encourage industrialized countries to tie development aid to recipients' human-rights records.
Speaking for the African countries, Kenya's deputy representative, Robert Kamau Gathungu, said they "strongly question" the United Nations' right to publish the index and do not understand "how it can be used in implementing projects in developing countries."
Some third-world countries are now drafting a resolution, to be voted on next week, banning further publication of the human-freedom index.
But so far the United Nations Development Program's top management, with backing from the United States, is saying that while the index should be improved and brought up to date, it will continue to appear.
"If society represses its people, it also represses their creativity and motivation and thus its growth rate and human progress," William H. Draper, the program's Administrator, told the governing body on Wednesday.
"We should not let our concern with finding a better way to measure freedom question the need for integrating freedom into our concept of human development," he said. "It needs no defense and it certainly needs no apology."
To chart how well the world's 160 Governments met their peoples' basic human needs last year, the new report also ranks them on a human-needs index that measures education, life expectancy and economic wealth.
While Japan is first and the United States is in seventh place, oil-producing Arab countries do relatively poorly because they neglect education of girls, and the poorest African nations occupy the bottom places.
The report also documents many third-world spending priorities that Dr. ul-Haq thinks democracy would help to change. While Pakistan spends three times as much on the military as on education and health care, for example, Japan has four times as many teachers as soldiers.

HEADLINE: Dollar's Rise a Crucial Issue for Group of Seven

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, June 22

 BODY:
When finance ministers and central bankers of the seven leading industrial democracies meet here on Sunday, they are likely to agree that the dollar's rise against other currencies is causing problems for the European and Japanese economies, private economists say.
Proposals for promising aid to the Soviet Union, if it tries to develop a free-market economy, are also expected to be discussed by officials from the so-called Group of Seven: Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States. But the British officials hosting the gathering play down the possibility that a decision on aid will be made. That issue will be left to the mid-July summit meeting here, at the end of which Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev will meet with leaders of the seven countries.
 
Invitation to Soviets Is Possible
 However, the Soviets could be immediately offered associate membership in the International Monetary Fund, British officials said. That would enable the I.M.F. to give the Soviet Union technical assistance in reforming its economy but would not allow the Soviets to receive I.M.F. money. 
 Another likely topic is the effort to revive the stalled trade talks known as the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Economists predict that the finance ministers and central bankers will call for the current value of the dollar to be maintained or to be lowered slightly. But many doubt that such an effort will hold the dollar down for more than a couple of months.
"The economic fundamentals around the world are for a stronger dollar," said David Morrison, a London economist for Goldman, Sachs & Company.
The dollar has soared in value since February. It is trading about 14 percent higher against a trade-weighted "basket" of currencies, nearly 25 percent higher against the German mark and nearly 9 percent higher against the Japanese yen.
A further rise would probably force Germany, other European countries and Japan to maintain or raise their interest rates, forcing the dollar down. Such increases will undoubtedly hurt their already weakening economies. And if those countries then bought less from the United States, that could sap the weak American economic recovery that many economists say has begun.
 
New Rate Policy Unlikely
 With the United States, Germany and Japan grappling with different economic problems, the ministers and central bankers seem unlikely to agree on a coordinated interest-rate policy, economists say. That belief was reinforced on Thursday, when Helmut Schlesinger, president-elect of the Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, said he did not expect the meeting to produce a concrete statement on the dollar.
Without such a coordinated rate policy, economists doubt that the dollar's rise can be contained. With inflation in Germany rising, economists expect the Germans to raise their interest rates sometime soon. That would prevent the weak mark from declining further.
With their economy weakening, the Japanese are believed to want to cut interest rates soon. But economists think they do not want the yen's value to drop, which would cause Japan's trade surplus to grow and risk further aggravating relations with the United States and the European Community.

HEADLINE: A Sense of Fiscal Doom

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
With just over a week till New York City's new fiscal year begins, City Hall is besieged by protesters and gripped by a sense of impending disaster. After striving for months to avoid deep cuts in city services, Mayor David N. Dinkins is now facing the prospect of adopting a budget balanced with cuts far more severe than those in the May plan that was called his "doomsday" budget.
Those cuts were meant to be so harsh as to force the state to give more aid and unions to make concessions. But that help has not come. And now both the Mayor and the City Council seem intent on passing a $29 billion budget so full of pain that they would immediately begin jockeying to find the money to undo it. 
 It is a political battle of great proportions, with Mr. Dinkins's very future at stake. Both sides remain nearly $500 million apart in how they would solve a budget gap of at least $3.5 billion, with the Council calling for much deeper cuts and the Mayor urging more property taxes. But far more than politics is at issue: at stake is perhaps $2 billion in cuts in city services and the inevitability of tax increases that also would affect all New Yorkers and change the city for years to come.
In this spring's cloudy fiscal climate, with the state budget passed two months late and still unresolved, the Mayor's most senior advisers complain they have no time even to think about what to do, and that there is not enough time for the inevitable political dances -- delicate in every budget and tortured this year -- to play themselves out.
 
Mayor Reduced to Exhortation
 Mr. Dinkins, obsessed with avoiding a takeover of the city's finances by a state panel, the Financial Control Board, but with less and less control over the factors that could provoke one, has been reduced to exhortation, calling on Albany, the Council, the unions and the citizenry to pitch in and help him balance the budget as required by law, simply because, he says, they have no choice.
The Mayor, who granted raises to the city's workers just months ago, says he hopes their unions might still make concessions on wages or benefits that would help avoid some of the 10,000 layoffs he has begun. He and the Council both still hope that after they pass a budget, the Municipal Assistance Corporation -- set up to borrow money on the city's behalf in its last fiscal crisis -- might still provide hundreds of millions of dollars in aid by refinancing some of the corporation's bonds.
"We're working very closely with all the pieces of this," the Mayor said on Friday. "There are many components, as you know."
But around City Hall, there is a growing sense that even if the combatants make peace at Armageddon, it would only be to return to the apocalypse within a few months or by next spring at the latest. The city's spending will remain fundamentally out of whack with the revenues it is able to take in, even if it manages to balance the budget for the fiscal year that starts on July 1.
"There is no plan, no leadership, no foresight," said Raymond D. Horton, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a watchdog group financed by businesses.
Last week, the Financial Control Board -- which could assert binding powers over the city's finances if the city ran a deficit of $100 million or more, lost access to the bond market or failed to make a debt service payment on its outstanding bonds -- issued a report noting that the Mayor's plan for getting beyond the coming year assumes $500 million a year in higher real-estate taxes, steadily increasing state aid and no further spending cuts.
The plan also assumes no further wage increases through mid-1995, and that would mean a wage freeze of unprecedented duration, the board said.
Mr. Horton of the Budget Commission took the uncharacteristic step of recently suggesting that the city need not pass the budget on time for the first time since the fiscal crisis of the mid-1970's. There would be little gain from such punctuality, he said, if it would not result in structural changes like permanently reducing the cost of city programs or shifting burdens, like welfare costs, to the state through a complex net of new state laws and cooperation between City Hall and Albany.
 
Costs of a Late Budget
 But others point out that the budget will be precariously balanced at best, and that only deadlines can impel action. If the city adopts a budget after the July 1 deadline, its current budget would continue in place, but since costs for debt service on bonds already issued will rise in any event, that, too could raise the hackles of the Control Board. Moreover, if the budget was late, it would have only 11 months of new tax revenues and 11 months worth of savings from spending cuts, and that would mean even deeper cuts.
The Budget Commission and Felix G. Rohatyn, chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, have argued that using one-time funds from the M.A.C., or from the sale of city land or other sources, should only be used as a bridge toward a fundamental reshaping of the size and scope of city spending.
Mr. Dinkins, too, argues that the state and Federal governments should bear greater costs, but there is little immediate prospect of that happening. The Mayor contends the city is primarily the victim of a cyclical recession that will pass.
For now, if Mr. Dinkins cannot stave off the worst of his own proposed cuts, he will be forced to sacrifice much of the expansive -- and expensive -- agenda he campaigned for two years ago, with consequences for his political future that would presumably not be promising. On the other hand, if he fails to balance the budget, he will invite a takeover by the state and risk being remembered as a Mayor too weak and waffling to have protected his own.
For the Council, newly empowered by recent changes in the City Charter, much is also at stake. It has positioned itself as the defender of the middle class by struggling to hold down property taxes. If the Control Board assumed binding powers, the Council would be the biggest loser of all, since Mr. Dinkins is at least a member of the board, while the Council is not, and it would have even less say over the city's spending priorities.
The Council's Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, said that about the best the Council can hope for at the moment is to reshape some of Mr. Dinkins's spending priorities, but that without help from the unions or the M.A.C., little else can be done.
"There's no way the pie's going to get bigger unless the other parties come back to the table," he said.

HEADLINE: Nashua Journal;
On Docket, Long Wait For Sound Of a Gavel

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NASHUA, N.H., June 21

 BODY:
It looks like a courthouse.
 The three-story brick-veneer building, which was completed last fall at a cost of $6.9 million, has the usual accompaniment of courtrooms, cell blocks, library space and judges' chambers. Security guards patrol its corridors, and lights illuminate it at night. 
 But the Hillsborough County Superior Court building here has no furniture. Worse, it has no judges.
The penny-conscious Legislature in this conservative state, which prides itself on having no income tax or sales tax, had initially failed to set aside enough money for furniture and judges. So the courthouse, which is urgently needed to relieve a backlog of up to 12 months for civil cases, sits unopened.
The tale of how the courthouse came to be built but left unused has provoked amusement, befuddlement and anger in Nashua, a rapidly growing city of 80,000 people that is now the second largest in New Hampshire.
"It is a joke, and some people say it's an example of government mismanagement at its worst," said Ernest A. Jette, a lawyer and president of the Nashua Bar Association. "People feel it is absolutely ridiculous that the state spends $7 million to build a courthouse that was ready to be put into service in 1990 and is still not being used."
To add injury to insult, Mr. Jette said, utilities, heat and security for the empty building cost about $70,000 each month.
The tale of the empty courthouse is a reflection on both New Hampshire's quirky politics and the recession that is gripping the state and much of the Northeast.
The troubles began in 1985 when the designers of the building projected its cost at $9 million to $10 million. It was widely agreed that the new courthouse was needed, because Nashua had grown from a population of 55,820 in 1970 to 79,662 in 1990, as New Hampshire had the second fastest-growing economy east of the Mississippi River after Florida. But the only courthouse in the county was in Manchester, 15 miles to the north.
Still, state legislators, most of whom were elected after taking what is known here as "the pledge," a vow not to impose a state income tax or sales tax, reduced the appropriation to $7.5 million.
Construction then began. But, said Mary Nelson, a Democratic State Senator from Nashua, "I don't think anybody took a look and noticed there wasn't enough money for furnishings."
Last year, as the building neared completion and the problem became apparent, Ms. Nelson sponsored a bill to set aside $980,000 for furniture. But by then New Hampshire's economy had suddenly gone into reverse, and the resulting drop in revenue caused large deficits in the state budget. Gov. Judd Gregg, a Republican, vetoed the bill as being too expensive.
In May, with embarrassment over the courthouse's plight mounting, Ms. Nelson put in four bills to buy furniture. "I made darn sure it would go through somehow," she said. This time, Governor Gregg signed the legislation.
But another bill she sponsored to employ four judges at the court has failed, so far. "Everyone is very supportive," she said, "but it's crazy in the Legislature. There is no money and everyone is afraid."
A big fear is that the continuing budget shortfall might finally arouse public support for an income tax or sales tax. Although the Legislature and the Governor have already made cuts of about $150 million, the $3.4 billion budget for the fiscal year beginning July 1 is still unbalanced.
So John Safford, clerk of the county court, is uncertain what will happen to the courthouse. He will soon be ordering the furniture, and expects it in September. Mr. Safford said he also believed that the state might reassign one or more of the six judges in Manchester to serve in the new building in Nashua.
That would not clear up the backlog of cases, which got so bad in 1989 that the county had to stop hearing all civil cases for three months. But at least it would allow the citizens of Nashua to have their own courthouse and would also relieve the pressure at the Manchester court, where trials are being held in makeshift courtrooms.
"I think a courtroom should have some dignity," Mr. Safford said, "in keeping with the solemnity of the proceedings."

HEADLINE: Political Memo;
Cuomo, Novelty Long Gone, Faces Up to 3d-Term Slump

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, June 22

 BODY:
Just six months into his third term, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's popularity has plummeted, by his own estimates. After more than eight years in office, he is facing problems that critics increasingly say are of his own making.
And as New York's budget extravaganza nears its angry denouement, the Governor's dominance of the state government, once unchallenged, no longer seems quite so secure. 
 Nobody ever said that a politician's job becomes easier the longer he sticks around.
 
'Kill the Messenger'?
 Just how much of the Governor's third-term troubles are simply a result of the state's budget problems -- and how much a result of his response to the problems -- is unclear. As Mr. Cuomo often notes, politics is often ruled by a "kill the messenger" mentality that blames the bearer of bad news for the bad news itself. And in a recession, there is plenty of bad news for the Governor to impart.
What does seem clear, though, as the Governor struggles to resolve the state's lingering budget problems, is that he is suffering from many of the familiar problems of political longevity. Much of what Mr. Cuomo did in his first two terms is now haunting him in his third.
"I don't know of a single politician that's been left unscathed by a third term," said Norman Adler, a political consultant whose clients include many state legislators. "The novelty has worn off. They go from initiating ideas to defending initiatives they did in the past. In effect, that's what's happening here."
Take, for example, the Governor's spending policies. During his first several years in office, Mr. Cuomo was presiding in a time of unusual affluence, and state spending during his first two terms, adjusted for inflation, grew by almost 20 percent. The Governor's liberal philosophy seemed, for the most part, to be in sync with his fiscal policies.
During the course of this year's record-breaking budget struggle, though, Mr. Cuomo has often seemed to be trying to remake his image for recessionary times.
Although he has not dropped his familiar liberal message, he has advocated a more conservative approach to budget making. He has pressed for sharp cuts in social-service programs and maligned those who call for maintaining these programs through higher taxes. And as if to underscore this new image, two weeks ago the Governor vetoed nearly $1 billion worth of spending the Legislature had added to his budget, saying it was not supported by sufficient revenues.
The Governor's fiscal conservatism, however, gives him something of the air of a reformed sinner: the state has run a deficit in six of the last eight years, including some when New York experienced record revenue growth.
Many politicians try to explain the shift as evidence of a nascent Presidential campaign by Mr. Cuomo. The Governor, always insisting that he has no plans to run for President and no plans to make plans, naturally denies this.
"You'd have to be kind of dumb in politics," Mr. Cuomo said recently, "or more clever than any politician I've ever met to figure out how plunging yourself 25 points in the polls, having all of your strongest constituents, even in Iowa, announce that you're dead meat politically, how all of this is a clever scheme to slip into the Presidential race and surge to the top."
 
No Regrets for Past Spending
 Instead, Mr. Cuomo says that he is simply responding to a new set of economic realities. While it was good to expand state programs when there was money -- and Mr. Cuomo says he regrets none of the spending he did in the past -- it is impossible to do so, he says, when there is no money.
But despite the Governor's efforts to define his position as the reasonable middle ground, at this point he has, it seems, satisfied neither side. Conservative groups, recalling his first two terms in office, accuse him of being a Johnny-come-lately to the cause of balanced budgets. Liberal groups accuse him of hypocrisy.
This quandary, political analysts say, demonstrates a classic problem of political survivors. Often, when conditions change, a politician finds it is dangerous, perhaps even impossible, to change with them.
"Mario Cuomo cut his political teeth a long time ago," said Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion in Poughkeepsie, which does frequent polling on state issues. "In politics it's very hard to get a new set of teeth. Some of the erosion in the Governor's support may be attributable to what is perceived as a lack of consistency."
A former aide to the Governor put it more bluntly: "You could say that he's ended up with the worst of both worlds."
Like the Governor's spending policies, his cool relations with the Legislature, once an asset, are threatening to become a liability to him.
For most of the last eight years, the testy relations between the Governor and the Legislature have worked to his advantage. Anonymous, undisciplined, at times even corrupt, the Legislature provided a useful antagonist against which the Governor sharpened his own image of hard work and rectitude.
Four years ago, for example, the Legislature approved a government ethics bill that Mr. Cuomo vetoed as inadequate. The Governor emerged as the clear moral victor, forcing the Legislature to pass a new and tougher bill.
Now, however, it is not so clear that the Governor will emerge victorious from his latest struggle with the Legislature, nor is it even clear what victory would consist of.
Earlier this month, when the Governor vetoed almost $1 billion worth of aid to struggling school districts and local governments, many applauded the move as courageous. The Governor, they said, was taking an unpopular but justifiably tough stand against excessive spending.
Critics, however, saw the move as a gambit intended to force lawmakers to renegotiate a budget that the Governor, who did not participate in the last phase of negotiations, found he did not like.
Whatever the Governor's motives were for the vetoes, they have set off state government's equivalent of a civil war. "The rift," the Assembly Speaker, Mel Miller, said with uncharacteristic understatement, "is growing."
 
Wants Back What He Vetoed
 Just how the Governor plans to end this war is uncertain. Having vetoed funds considered crucial to New York City and other municipalities, Mr. Cuomo is now in the awkward position of having to ask the Legislature to restore some of them. Last week, Mr. Cuomo publicly called on the legislative leaders to join him at the negotiating table.
But the legislative leaders, always wary of Mr. Cuomo, are now more reluctant than ever to cooperate with him. They say they want to see a full-fledged plan for how to restore the money before they negotiate.
As the standoff continues, it seems that Mr. Cuomo, even if he is still ahead in the public relations battle, is having increasing trouble scoring points against the Legislature. In Albany, there is mounting talk about a possible veto override, which would be a first for Mr. Cuomo. And outside of Albany, there seems to be a feeling that the state government, with Governor Cuomo at the helm, is running adrift.
"You don't get a sense that he's trying to lead this process or reach out to people," one New York City official said. "You don't know where he's going. There's an odd sense of directionlessness to the process."

HEADLINE: THE REGION;
In Taxes on Real Estate Where Is The Limit?

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
EVER since Peter Minuit swapped about $24 in fripperies for land over which the Manhattoes -- the first participants in New York's tribal politics -- held a disputed claim, people have been debating the true value of the city's real estate. Now, 365 years later, the debate has been elevated from the abstract to the concrete: are the property taxes that New York City or its precursors began imposing in 1654 approaching their legal and practical limits?
That debate will be joined this week when the City Council is expected to deal with Mayor David N. Dinkins's proposal to raise real estate taxes by $776 million to balance the $29 billion budget for the fiscal year beginning a week from tomorrow. The Council has acknowledged that an increase is necessary, but has refused to budge beyond $300 million. 
 Not surprisingly, property owners complain that even that figure is too much -- particularly during a recession when any additional cost of living or of doing business, coupled with higher water and sewer charges and the certainty of reductions in municipal services, may prompt landlords to abandon their buildings and commercial tenants to close or, along with homeowners, to leave town and take thousands of jobs with them.
A coalition of property owners has already spent nearly $1 million on a radio and print advertising campaign to persuade Mayor Dinkins and Peter F. Vallone, the City Council Speaker, to mine other sources of revenue and to cut expenses before turning further to the property tax, which the city can raise without the state's permission. Total revenues from the increased property tax proposed by the Mayor would account for more than $7.3 billion, or nearly half of the local tax revenue generated to pay for his proposed budget.
The debate is complicated by a formula established by the state Legislature a decade ago. In New York City, the relatively modest property tax on private homes represents a multibillion-dollar subsidy for the middle class. As a result, many other New Yorkers pay more -- including residents of cooperatives and condominiums and residential and commercial tenants.
The effective rate for owners of one- , two- and three-family homes and small condominiums this year is about 79 cents for every $100 of their home's market value; for apartment buildings, including co-ops and condominiums, the comparable rate is $4.12. While many variables can make comparisons misleading, the system also perpetuates disparities between urban and suburban homeowners, who typically pay more.
The formula's inflexibility has united a broad coalition of property owners. They favor the lowest possible increase beyond the $130 million earmarked for the Mayor's anti-crime program and the higher bills that result from an increase in the assessed valuation of individual properties rather than from a rise in the tax rate. The coalition recalls that during the fiscal crisis of the mid-1970's property taxes were actually frozen for five years to give landlords and developers a modicum of stability. (This time, the city projects another $1 billion in increases for the two fiscal years beginning July 1, 1992.) The property owners point to the rise in property-tax delinquencies -- up about 1 percent over last year when $75 million of the taxes assessed by the city were not collected. And they are invoking what may be an arcane technical device to advance their case: whether the city is nearing its constitutional debt limit.
The State Constitution provides that to pay for operating expenses, the city may tax property up to 2.5 percent of the average full valuation of taxable real estate. The State Board of Equalization and Assessment is supposed to conduct a market survey every three years, but last completed one in 1987 -- before real estate prices tumbled. As a result, the board's estimate represents an approximation, from which trends are extrapolated that diverge dramatically from other official calculations.
"Whether you own a condo or a co-op, a small apartment building or a large one, you know in your heart of hearts it's not worth what it was three years ago," said John J. Gilbert 3d, president of the Rent Stabilization Association, a landlords' group, which has provided evidence of the decline to the state board.
"What David Dinkins and the City Council do by July 1 will shape whether New York City begins to move out of the recession and whether the programs the Mayor would like funded will ever be funded," said Steven Spinola, president of the Real Estate Board of New York.
City officials acknowledge the decline, but figure that they still have plenty of leeway -- $2 billion or more -- before the legal window on property tax increase begins to close in the mid-1990's. Behind that technical debate, though, lies a more fundamental question.
"The reality of politics is, you have to pass a tax rate," said Allen J. Proctor, executive director of the State Financial Control Board, which oversees city finances. "The city still has billions of dollars in tax authority today, but the reality is, who's going to raise the tax rate to capture all of that? The real estate people hope that by challenging the nature of the limit, they will bring the statutory number below the political reality.
"The city's property tax has been the primary source of growth for the last several years -- about 10 percent a year -- and it really has been funding all the expansion in social services," Mr. Proctor said. "The tax burden is having an adverse affect. You never quite know when you cross the line of affordability, but you certainly would have crossed it under the Mayor's plan."
Crossing that line would be bad news for landlords. But if property owners have to choose between paying their banks or paying their taxes, the consequences for a city in which property values have soared from $24 to well over $100 billion could be equally grim. The perversity of the business cycle is such, though, that when things get bad enough they can become good again, at least for those tenants who have won favorable terms from landlords hungry for a guaranteed source of revenue. One tenant, with two and a half years left on its lease in midtown Manhattan, renegotiated for 10 years at roughly half the rent. That tenant, as it happens, was the Real Estate Board of New York.

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
Free Trade: No Longer Just a Case of North Versus South

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: CHAPEL HILL, N.C.

 BODY:
TRADE politics in the United States does not just fail to follow party lines. It also no longer follows the traditional boundaries of regions.
Rather, the nation has become a quilt of different views on free trade, with patches of strong advocacy sometimes adjacent to strong opposition. 
 In few regions has this become as clear as in the South, and especially in North Carolina, a state whose many stands of silent pine trees cloak pharmaceutical research laboratories and computer factories as well as turn-of-the-century textile mills. The recent opening of negotiations with Mexico for a proposed free trade agreement and the pending votes in the next two weeks on whether to renew China's most-favored-nation trade status are part of a debate that has divided a state long proud of its sense of community.
 "You're getting a real division, much more by districts," on trade votes as the variety of industries in the South increases, said Deborah L. Spar, an assistant professor at the Harvard Business School.
On one side in North Carolina are lawmakers like Representative Howard Coble, a Republican from the textile center of Greensboro. He defied his party and the Administration last month to vote against the renewal of the President's authority to negotiate trade agreements and submit them for so-called "fast track consideration" by Congress. In effect, the vote was against the negotiation of a free-trade agreement with Mexico and another international round of trade liberalization, either of which might allow another surge of textile imports. Now Mr. Coble is leaning toward voting against a renewal of China's preferential access to the American market, an aide said Thursday.
But Representative David E. Price, a Democrat whose district is adjacent to Mr. Coble's and includes Chapel Hill, a university town, and Raleigh, the state capital, also defied his party to vote in favor of "fast track" authority for the President. His district includes factories of multinationals like the International Business Machines Corporation and the American Telephone and Telegraph Company,and smaller businesses like hosiery and soybean producers. All feel they are internationally competitive and would prosper if worldwide trade barriers were reduced.
The contradictory votes by Mr. Price and Mr. Coble illustrate a historic change in the South's attitudes toward international trade.
The split divides producers of goods of which the United States is a net importer, like clothing, and industries that are net exporters, ranging from soybeans to telecommunications equipment. All of these divisions have deep historical roots in the South.
An important cause of the Civil War was the South's resentment of rising tariffs on imported manufactured goods imposed to protect infant industries in the North. The South remained resolutely in favor of free trade until the 1930's, largely out of an unwillingness to pay higher prices to allow "shoddy goods from the Northeast to supplant better, or perceived as better, goods from Great Britain," said Edward M. Graham, a senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics in Washington.
But as textiles, apparel and consumer electronics moved to the South in the middle of this century, attitudes began to change. Low barriers to trade began to mean not inexpensive agricultural machinery from Britain, but low-cost apparel imports from East Asia that could drive Southern factories out of business.
With the free-trade votes of lawmakers like Mr. Price, the issue appears at first glance to have come full circle. Representative Alex McMillan, a Republican from North Carolina's largest city, Charlotte, also voted last month in favor of reducing trade barriers.
But the justifications provided by Southern free trade supporters today are not the same as those offered by, for example, Cordell Hull, a Tennessee Democrat. As Franklin D. Roosevelt's Secretary of State for nearly 12 years, he helped lay the foundations for an international free trade regime after World War II, basing it on the principle that trade barriers discriminate against consumers and in favor of influential industries.
Free trade rhetoric in the South of the 1990's has different themes, in part because the region industrialized. One conspicuous argument has been the need to win greater access to foreign markets for American businesses, thereby preserving American jobs, Mr. Graham said.
Mr. Price, while mentioning consumers' interest in cheaper imports, emphasized the export success of his district's businesses when explaining his vote. "I am confident that our people can be major players in the world economy," he said.
The other strong and fairly new argument for Southern lawmakers to support free trade has been the need to lure foreign investment and technology. In justifying his vote to support free trade negotiations, Mr. McMillan stressed the presence of 340 foreign firms in the Charlotte area, producing everything from chemicals to paper products machinery.
Total foreign direct investment in the United States more than tripled, to $544 billion from $133 billion, between 1982 and 1989, according to a recent inflation-adjusted Commerce Department estimate.
As industries continue to spread across national frontiers and as some Congressional districts attract foreign-owned factories and others do not, foreign investment may become one of the most enduring influences in breaking down regional unity, Ms. Spar said. "As the borders open up, you get less regional politics," she said.

Whining, Excuses, Hysteria

BYLINE: By LESLIE H. GELB

 BODY:
If I were a Japanese leader listening to all the anti-Japanese whining and hysteria and double-standarditis in the U.S., I might become an America-basher.
 Americans have turned Japan-bashing into a cottage industry from Congress to the Harvard Business Review to Detroit to the C.I.A. to Main Street and to a recent book hawking a future war with Japan. The Japanese are finally getting frustrated and angry about all this, and may start bashing back. The bashing business (Europeans joining in) could spiral out of control with the most serious consequences, despite the commendable efforts of President Bush and Prime Minister Kaifu.
 
 Beyond argument, Japan's economy is more protectionist than ours, and we should press very hard to change this. That said, the Japanese make two telling points: Americans are not such pure free traders as they pretend; and solutions to many U.S. complaints lie not in Japan but in America.
 Look at the Structural Impediments Initiative, the central dialogue between the two countries on removing barriers to trade and investment. In these exchanges, we are asking Japan to do some sensible things like combatting its anti-competitive business practices. But we are also demanding that the Japanese save less and spend more governmental funds. In other words, we are telling them to go on a consumer binge and increase government deficits, or, in effect, to adopt the self-destructive policies of the Reagan Administration. Fortunately for them, they are not so dumb; they are plowing extra government dollars into infrastructure and strengthening their economy.
 And what is Japan asking us to do in these talks? Among other things, to lower our Federal deficit (to lower interest rates and stimulate investment), to increase our savings rate (to the same end), to improve our public educational system and push our corporations into longer-term business strategies. In sum, Tokyo is urging us to take the very steps any American with half a brain knows we ought to be taking in our own self-interest.
 Remember the Voluntary Restraint Agreement on auto sales? We cornered the Japanese into limiting their auto exports. They did so, and then also started manufacturing more cars in the U.S. (to the delight of the communities where they settled) and thereby increased their total auto sales here.
 Such experiences are part of an established pattern: We cut an agreement with them. They fulfill it to the letter, but are clever enough to find other ways to gain advantage. We accuse them of violating the spirit of the agreement and then issue a new set of demands.
 If U.S. auto manufacturers and auto workers would stop making such demands and whining for a moment, they might stumble on the principal cause of their decline: their Japanese competitors, for the most part, have designed and made better cars.
 The American mania about Japan goes well beyond autos, down to some intriguing new machinations by the C.I.A. A recent C.I.A.-sponsored study by the Rochester Institute of Technology calls Japan "non-democratic," and "racist" and argues that Tokyo is headed for world dominance unless challenged by the West. Is the agency, to justify its post-cold war persona, searching for a new threat to supplant Moscow? Such Japan-bashing certainly finds resonance among Americans, who feel more menaced by Japan than the Soviet Union -- 72 percent to 20 percent, according to a Business Week survey.
 The Japanese do not help themselves much either. Even when they act generously, they do so in begrudging ways that earn them no credit -- as happened with their $13 billion contribution to the Persian Gulf war.
 Sharp conflicts are not new in Japanese-American relations. But leaders on both sides have contained the inevitable economic clashes in the last 20 years by invoking the common Soviet threat. No more.
 Now, as the economic balance of power shifts increasingly toward Tokyo, American self-righteousness and nastiness toward Japan seem to know no bounds. Our protestations surpass our important and legitimate grievances. Our complaints suggest a loss of competitive nerve among American businessmen and workers.
 Their Japan-bashing, supported by a legion of politicians and well-paid consultants, begins to smell like an excuse for not dealing with our own shortcomings.

HEADLINE: Council, Blaming Dinkins, Cuts Deeper

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
The leaders of the New York City Council yesterday angrily accused Mayor David N. Dinkins of a failure of leadership, as the Council completed a list of proposals to make $476 million in service cuts on top of the $1.5 billion in cuts already proposed by the Mayor.
"The administration has abdicated its responsibilities," the Council leaders said in a statement issued by Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone and his 10-member negotiating committee after a caucus at City Hall. 
 It was the latest twist in an increasingly ominous stalemate between the Mayor and the Council, with only eight days before the deadline for the adoption of a new city budget. Each side is seeking to shift blame for the impasse as the city confronts its worst fiscal crisis since the mid-1970's.
The Council proposed the service cuts -- including the elimination of 2,000 day-care slots and the consolidation of some city agencies -- to replace $476 million in property-tax increases proposed by Mr. Dinkins as part of his $1.1 billion tax package. The Council has agreed to property-tax increases that would produce an estimated $300 million.
 
Large Scale and Painful
 Yesterday, Mr. Vallone said he would not release details of the Council's proposed service cuts until its committee members had a chance to review the list and suggest alternatives. Council staff members would say only that the list included large-scale reorganizations of city agencies, painful cuts in services, and reductions in the budgets of elected officials, including Council members themselves.
On Friday, in a move that incensed many Council members, the Dinkins administration released details of the Council plan. And while the reductions proposed by the Council appeared to differ little from those offered by the administration, aides to Mayor Dinkins said they were unnecessary and would devastate the city.
In a statement issued yesterday by the Mayor's acting press secretary, Leland T. Jones, the administration said the cuts would eliminate the 2,000 day-care slots, reduce economic development programs, the staff of the Human Rights Commission, jobs for young people and adult literacy programs, and slash new education and youth programs proposed by the Mayor as part of a city anti-crime package.
It said that spending for road and highway repairs would be reduced along with money to maintain city-owned buildings.
In the statement, Mr. Jones chided the Council for its "heated rhetoric," and suggested the Council leaders were merely venting their frustration.
Behind the scene, Council members voiced fury at the Mayor and said he was trying to deflect responsiblity for the deep service cuts that he himself had proposed -- from closing libraries to slashing health services -- by urging the public to lobby the Council to restore the cuts.
In their own statement yesterday, Council leaders blamed the administration for the cuts it proposed, and accused it of negotiating in bad faith. If the administration had succeeded in negotiating with the state and city unions, and cut waste from city government, the additional service cuts would never had been proposed, the statement said.
"If the administration had approached this budget crisis intelligently and creatively, it would have gone ahead with a rational plan to cut back the size and cost of government," the statement said. "Instead the administration's only answer is Draconian cuts and crippling taxes."
Mr. Vallone said the Council still hoped to negotiate a settlement with the administration and was not contemplating drafting a budget bill incorporating the cuts.
He suggested that the cuts were a way of showing the administration that the Council was serious about limiting increases in property taxes and was prepared to do what was necessary to see that it was carried out.
Even if the Council passed all the taxes called for in the Mayor's budget, Mr. Vallone said, the cuts proposed by Mr. Dinkins would still be necessary.
"They are trying to show that the Council are the ones that are closing the pharmacies and the prenatal clinics," he said. Mr. Dinkins's budget calls for closing pharmacies in city hospitals and slashing spending on prenatal services.
Staff members for the Council and the Mayor reviewed the Council's proposals over the weekend.
During the last few days, as Mayor Dinkins sought to pressure the Council, l members were deluged with calls from city commissioners, lobbyists and residents.The statement yesterday from the Council's negotiating committee was intended to show that the Council was united behind Mr. Vallone, aides said.
Mr. Vallone said that wage increases granted by the Mayor were responsible for some of the cuts and that the worst cuts could be avoided only if Mr. Dinkins won concessions from city unions that improve productivity.

HEADLINE: A Bounty of Food Festivals

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STOFFEL; JENNIFER STOFFEL contributes to The New York Times from Cleveland.

 BODY:
AFTER a winter of pale, imported substitutes, Midwesterners are inclined to find any number of excuses to enjoy farm-fresh produce and fresh-baked goods. Aside from taking to the fields themselves or merely seeking out a roadside stand or urban market, attending at least one or two of the region's many food festivals is a favored tradition during the summer months.
 Traveling across the region from festival to festival, a visitor is inclined to discover some common themes. With contests ranging from seed spitting to corn shucking and plate lunches made and served by church groups, a typical gathering offers urban visitors a modern-day tour of small-town life. And, in an era when so many agricultural products bear little resemblance to their fresh origins, buying from the farmer has its attractions. 
 One of the biggest and most well-known harvest celebrations in the region, the weeklong Cherry Festival in Traverse City, Mich., in recent years has attracted nearly a half a million people. The city's small downtown, just a block removed from the Lake Michigan beach, is swollen with visitors during the early July festival days. Begun in 1926 to promote the state's crop, the cherries now merely serve as a backdrop for an array of competitions, parades and shows.
 Still, there are plenty of cherries and freshly made cherry baked goods and products on hand. One of the best spots to sample the ruby red Schmidt and Nelson as well as lighter Napoleon varieties of native sweet cherries is at the open-air food market set up along the Lake Michigan bayfront. (The tart Montmorency variety typically ripens later in the season.) During festival week a number of the orchards set up stands filled with cartons of fresh cherries along with cherry cookies, pies, jams and syrups.
 While the more traditional among the festivals are timed to celebrate a particular harvest, nearly anything edible can be the spark of an idea for a single-food celebration. Featuring the products of the local Velvet Ice Cream Company, for 17 years running over Memorial Day weekend, community members of Utica, Ohio, have organized an Old Fashioned Ice Cream Festival.
 This year, a battalion of volunteers dished out ice cream cones, sundaes, banana splits and root beer floats from a makeshift, tent-covered ice cream stand set up in the middle of a grassy field to lines of impatient visitors from not-too-distant Columbus and Cleveland. A Girl Scout troop's offering of ice cream pies and cakes attracted only a few. A nearby vendor hawking pork tenderloin sandwiches and hotdogs was largely ignored. Visitors here come for the ice cream and its better-than-most creamy texture.
 Served up in four-ounce-plus dips, a two-dip cone was priced at a reasonable $1.25; an even larger waffle cone went for $2. "We don't want anyone to go away without eating ice cream," said Ray Lewis, one of the festival's directors.
 Just as popular as the eating of ice cream is watching others compete to eat a lot. The annual Ice Cream Eating Contest is by far the biggest festival attraction, according to Mr. Lewis. So popular, in fact, that it is divided into three sections -- one contest for each day of the three-day event, which is open to all ages. Velvet provides youngsters with all the free vanilla ice cream they can eat for two minutes straight; adults can indulge for eight minutes. The record of six pints was broken this year by Bill Lacurto of nearby Newark, Ohio, who downed eight pints of Velvet vanilla in eight minutes to the roars of encouragement from a crowd of onlookers packed in bleacher seats.
 Spanning the nine-acre grounds of the 75-year-old ice cream company -- the small town's largest single industry -- and flowing over the highway onto a field next to the electric company, crafts, pony rides and a small circus are among the attractions.
 On the top of any list of the most unusual festivals is the annual Moonshine Festival in New Straitsville, Ohio, which says it is the sole food fest in the state celebrating something illegal. The aim of the organizers is to recall the area's Prohibition-Era heritage.
 TAKING over the three-block downtown business district, the fair includes carnival rides, food stands and an entertainment calendar of harmonica playing and fiddle music for an open-air center-of-town stage. At noon, a batch of chicken is cooked on the grill by members of the volunteer fire department. While moonshine itself is (obviously) not served, a locally concocted moonshine pie has an ardent following. The recipe is a closely guarded secret, but the pie has a gooey sweet taste of brown sugar or perhaps molasses.
 It seems that, for residents in the Hocking Hills of central Ohio, where the irregular economy of logging and coal mining has brought with it irregular employment, moonshining has stood its ground as a sort of fallback occupation.
 At Ward's Restaurant, where burgers, fries, homemade vegetable soup and milkshakes are the centerpiece of the lunch menu, most residents queried at the counter during this year's celebration admitted to knowing someone else who continued to operate a still. "I don't know where to get some personally," said Martha Close, who was covering the customers counterside. "But most people around here would."
 Apart from the nostalgia, for Ward's and the town's handful of retail businesses, the three-day Memorial Day weekend festival brings with it the busiest and most profitable days of the year.
 Many of the region's farmers also realize they are on to a good thing. In Milan, Ohio, population 1,500, the Musk Melon Festival was started in 1959 as a side event to the high school's homecoming. These days the town plays host to 150,000 visitors over Labor Day weekend. The tiny town's square -- sliced in half by Ohio Route 113 -- is taken over by melon farmers who pull up their trucks to sell fresh melons. Church members can be counted on to provide musk melon pie and watermelon sherbet. And a nearby dairy has devised a musk melon ice cream for the event.
 While the sandy soil and temperate Lake Erie breezes in Milan were always habitable for musk melon, the crop has grown from a novelty to one of the area's thriving industries, according to Lou Weiss, a festival director for 32 years.
 Some of the smallest, less publicized festivals can also turn out to be the best for an afternoon outing. The creativity of the sideline activities associated with a farm market is limited only by the farmer's imagination and energy. At the Spring Hill Farm Market, a 200-acre farm orchard in Geneva, Ohio, near the Lake Erie shore, enthusiasm for the ripening of nearly every fruit crop brings with it a weekendlong celebration of picking and baking. In August it's peaches; in the fall there are grapes, and before closing for the winter there is an annual harvest festival.
 For strawberry season, irregularly scheduled in June for the past five years -- depending on the ripening of the fruit -- the event typically combines crafts and antique sales and horse and buggy tours of the 200-acre farm orchard with the baking and selling of everything and anything strawberry -- strawberry bread, strawberry-rhubarb pie and strawberry tarts topped with real whipped cream -- all made in the orchard's bakery.
 
WHERE TO DIG INTO CORN, RICE AND FRUIT
 Food festivals in the Midwest are not likely to be listed on anyone's five-star guide to eating, yet there are some tips to discovering the best at any of them. Unless you like greasy bratwurst or fried pork loin sandwiches and french fries literally dripping wet from the deep fryer, stay away from the traveling vendors and search out church groups' food tents, which typically feature the cooking talents of its members. And keep your orders simple: go with the special, which is likely to be the freshest, hottest and best made.
 In addition to festivals mentioned in the accompanying article, these are worth a visit:
 
Illinois
Sweet Corn and Watermelon Festival, Aug. 11 to 17, Mount Vernon. In its 20th year, the weeklong celebration features a parade, a corn-shucking contest and, on the final day, all the sweet corn (cooked in a steam engine) and watermelon you can eat, free. Information: (800) 252-5464.
 
Michigan
Cherry Festival, July 6 to 13, Traverse City. Festival highlights this year include three parades, a marching band competition, a sand-sculpturing competition and a country band show. The final day is the biggest, with both an early morning parade and the grand finale fireworks at night. (616) 947-4230.
 
Minnesota
Wild Rice Days, Aug. 31 to Sept. 1, McGregor. A 15-year tradition, both native wild rice (harvested off the lakes) and the cultured variety (grown in commercial paddies) are featured. A Saturday morning wild rice pancake breakfast, a threshing show, street dancing and carnival rides are part of the list of events. (218) 768-3692.
 
Ohio

HEADLINE: Alternative to Prison Mends Fences and Lives

BYLINE: By ANDI RIERDEN

 BODY:
DENNIS BROWN patted down the last handful of peat moss around a circle of marigolds, stood back and admired the design. He wore his baseball cap turned backwards, bubble-gum pink sunglasses and an oversized, sleeveless T-shirt. The name Essie was etched beneath the rose tattoo on his arm. "That's my girlfriend," he said, breaking into a grin. Mr. Brown said he had worked all morning cleaning and landscaping this triangular green across the street from the Connecticut Prison Association's Alternative Incarceration Center in Hartford. Before he was arrested and sentenced to serve three years in prison for a larceny conviction, Mr. Brown had planned to start his own landscaping company, he said.
After spending nine months of his sentence in the state's maximum security prison in Somers, he was accepted into the center's six-month program in May and now lives in one of several apartments managed by the prison association until he can find permanent housing. Five days a week he participates in supervised community service projects, which range from cleaning parks to painting municipal buildings, and he attends daily psychological and job counseling sessions. 
 Since his arrival he has put in more than 100 hours of such community service work, he said.
"In Somers I sat around counting the minutes and trying to figure ways to avoid a fight," said Mr. Brown, who added that he was beaten while in prison and stabbed with a knife and fork. "But in this program I feel like I'm going somewhere."
The Alternative Incarceration Program, developed five years ago by the Prison Association and the State Corrections Department, works with accused and convicted felons who are not considered threats to public safety. They are allowed to leave prison, freeing cells for offenders regarded as more dangerous. In the past two years, 16 centers serving 1,300 offenders have opened across the state, said James Greene, director of programming for the Prison Association. Two-thirds of its clients are people who have been accused of crimes but have not yet gone to trial, he said.
The Alternative Incarceration Program is the major focus in a move to reform the state's penal system by creating punishments that are less restrictive than imprisonment yet more confining than traditional probation. Corrections officials say they want to ease prison overcrowding by giving judges, prosecutors and defense lawyers a better range of sentencing options. Several states, including New York and Alabama, are considering adopting Connecticut's model.
Given the expense of housing the growing the prison population over the next decade, incarceration can no longer be viewed as the main form of criminal punishment, judges said. Because of overcrowding in Connecticut's prisons, they said, 70 percent of offenders spend less than one third of their sentences behind bars. The innovative sanctions will enable the state to imprison more serious offenders for longer portions of their sentence, they said.
"If we can find alternatives that would give the public the safety it requires and the court the accountability it demands, then we can solve the overcrowding problem," said William Carbone, the coordinator of the state's Office of Alternative Sanctions, which was created earlier this year. The office oversees the alternative incarceration centers and will monitor services for offenders like drug treatment and community service programs, halfway houses and vocational training.
The Alternative Incarceration Program is being developed as the state nears completion of a 10-year, $900 million construction and renovation plan that will add 11,000 new prison beds by 1992. Mr. Carbone said that it costs $25,000 a year to house an inmate in one of the state's 22 prisons, while keeping someone in an alternative incarceration center costs around $3,600.
A recent report by the Prison Overcrowding Commission said Connecticut's prison population increased 131 percent from 1980 to 1990, rising to 9,422 inmates from 4,885. The report attributed the steep rise primarily to higher arrest and conviction rates that began in the mid-1980s with the emergence of widespread drug trade. From June 1984 to September 1990, the number of people confined in the state's prisons for sale or possession of drugs increased more than sixfold, to 2,715 from 450.
Critics of traditional punishment have argued that imprisonment is potentially destructive, because it fails to address the underlying psychological and economic reasons that lead people to commit crimes.
"All incarceration does is incapacitate," Mr. Greene said, "whereas alternative sanctions attempt to change a criminal's behavior and give him the tools to go out and not make the same mistakes."
Community service work is a major part of the alternative program, he said. Last month, dozens of work crews from the program cleaned and made repairs at several state and municipal parks in preparation for Memorial Day weekend. While out on the job they wore gray-and-orange T-shirts that read, "We're giving something back."
 
Bathhouses and Picnic Tables
 At Hammonasset Beach State Park in Madison, workers washed and painted bathhouses and picnic tables and will continue to clean litter from the beach and do minor maintenance work once a week through the summer.
The other day, Doug Jackson, 22 years old, was part of a team assigned to mend the park's snow fences. Mr. Jackson said he was sentenced to serve three years for second-degree assault after a fight with his girlfriend that left her partially blind. He said that it was the first time he had hit her, and that he was drunk when the incident occurred.
After spending a year and a half in prison, Mr. Jackson said he was accepted into the Alternative Incarceration Center's program in Hartford nearly six months ago. In that time he has received alcohol and drug counseling that has helped to bolster his self-esteem, he said. He now lives with his sister and visits the center several times a week for job counseling and attends Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. He said he hoped to be hired back at Bradley International Airport, where he worked as a baggage checker before he went to prison.
"One thing I have learned is that I have to do things to better myself," said Mr. Jackson. He added that within the last year he has made peace with his ex-girlfriend, who is now dating someone else. "I told her, 'If you ever need anything, I'll be here for you,' " he said.
Mr. Greene of the Prison Association said that the majority of people in the Alternative Incarceration Program are substance abusers who come from troubled families and need intensive counseling to restore their self-image. During the six-month program, they are closely monitored and must attend daily family and group therapy sessions and be tested regularly for drug abuse, he said.
Their successes and failures are reported to correctional authorities. Of those accepted into the program, some 40 percent fail and are returned to prison, Mr. Greene said.
 
Judges See Shortcomings
 "Clients are told straight out that if they aren't going to cooperate, then we automatically become part of the incarceration process," he said.
Judges in Connecticut have significantly increased their use of alternative sanctions over the past year, but they frequently find that outside programs are not uniform, have limited capacity or are unavailable for judges in some jurisdictions, said Judge Aaron Ment, the state's chief court administrator.
Because most people who are convicted and sentenced to prison typically serve a much shorter time than a community-based program would require, and because the programs require the offenders to expend effort in both work and therapy, many of them are unwilling to submit to alternative sanctions, he said.
"Program time is hard time, and jail time is easy time," Judge Ment said. "We may sentence people to programs, but they may refuse to participate, so we end up sending them to jail. And that's the place where they wanted to be to begin with."
Sherry Haller, the executive director of the Justice Education Center, a state-financed education and research group, said that sentencing reforms are needed to extend punishment and give people convicted of crimes more incentives to remain in alternative programs. She said her center had nearly completed a study of the state's prison population and the options for intermediate sanctions. The research will make it easier for court authorities to determine appropriate sentencing, she said.
 
Transition to Community
 Because statewide alternative sanctions are a relatively new concept, judges said they saw risks in developing such a plan. Any highly publicized incident involving misconduct by an offender from an alternative program could imperil public support, they said.
Yet studies of the state's halfway house programs, introduced in 1980 to serve as a transition from prison to the community, have shown that participants had a lower recidivism rate than those who were released directly from prison into the community, and that the halfway houses do not add to problems of public safety .
Marlene Bermubez, 24, said that the seven months she has spent at the Mary Magdalene Halfway House on Park Avenue in Bridgeport has been far more valuable than the two years she spent in prison. Raised in Father Panik Village, a public-housing complex in Bridgeport noted for its high crime rate, Ms. Bermubez was convicted of first-degree assault for shooting a man in the leg. She said the man was harassing her.
Ms. Bermubez said the drug and alcohol counseling and family therapy sessions offered by the halfway house have taught her to control her anger and think positively about her future. She said her father and three sisters are now serving prison sentences, adding that she hoped to get an apartment and become a home health care aid after her release.
"When I first came here, I thought everyone owed me something," she said. "But now I realize that we're all just hurt children inside, with the same problems to overcome."

HEADLINE: Focus: New Buffalo, Mich.;
Chicagoans Rediscover a Shore Resort

BYLINE: By CHERYL KENT

 BODY:
A RISING second-home market in Michigan communities clustered on the southern edge of Lake Michigan is renewing the regional importance of the area, known as the South Shore, which has long been familiar to Chicagoans as a vacation spot.
Early in the century, Chicago's South Siders went to Michigan and North Siders went to Wisconsin for the summer. The Irish and Lithuanians transplanted the ethnic character of their South Side neighborhoods in the South Shore townships: Union Pier was Lithuanian and Grand Beach was Irish. Though those communities have changed, they still retain their ethnic flavor. 
 Then, as now, Chicagoans were attracted by the South Shore's quiet, wooded atmosphere, beaches and the dunes. Its life as a resort area lasted into the 50's. Vacationers stayed in rambling clapboard-sided hotels or built small frame cottages.
Some families have been going to the South Shore for generations, including the family that gave Chicago two Mayors, Richard J. Daley and his son, Richard M., the current Mayor. But the area began to draw fewer people in the 50's. Air-conditioning had made staying in the city tolerable. And in 1969, Interstate 94, which let people bypass the South Shore and vacation farther afield, was completed, eventually leaving rental cottages and hotels vacant.
But in 1979 the harbor at New Buffalo was dredged after the Army Corps of Engineers cleared the channel to it from Lake Michigan. This lead to the rejuvenation of the South Shore. Cottages and hotels were renovated and once again are filled in July and August. Moreover, vacation homes of a scale and splendor new to the area are under construction.
The interstate, instead of carrying vacationers farther from home, now provides quick access to the relatively close-by South Shore for Chicagoans concerned with the cost of gasoline.
One of the most visible developments is South Cove in New Buffalo, 65 miles from Chicago. Once a 52-acre swamp, it is now a harbor condominium project with 217 units and 400 boat slips. All but the 15 most recently built units have been sold, and some of the earlier units are up for resale. Condominiums that sold for $75,000 in 1980, when the development began, now fetch $130,000, said Karen Larkin, vice president of marketing and sales for New Buffalo Harbor, the local company developing South Cove.
THE project has 110 condominium units of 800 to 2,000 square feet in buildings at the harbor's edge, as well as three sizes of houses built on pilings over the water with boat slips alongside each house. There are 13 houses of 2,400 square feet, 50 of 890 square feet each and 44 of 400 square feet. Fifteen of the mid-size houses were recently completed; they are priced from $200,000 to $225,000. A large house that sold in 1984 for $250,000 is now listed for $310,000.
Buyers of residences not actually on the water have an option to buy a boat slip.
Plans for additional units at South Cove, which was designed by the Chicago architects Harry Weese & Associates, call for 13 private houses and a hotel.
Also in New Buffalo, Forest Beach Property, a local developer undertaking its first project, is selling 43 one-acre lots on a 65-acre lakefront camp bought for $2.8 million from the Y.W.C.A. of Chicago in 1989. Lots with beach frontage are selling for $2,000 a linear foot, or a total of $300,000 for the average 150-foot frontage. Others go for $84,000 to $156,000.
Houses must conform to requirements that spell out minimum size, selected architects and landscaping standards. The developer estimates the houses will cost about $250,000.
A major Forest Beach cost is preparing essentially raw land. The first phase included building and improving roads, tearing down overhead power lines and bringing in electricity, gas and water through underground conduits (the camp had had well water). That phase cost $2.5 million.
In the last 18 months, 22 lots have been sold, although no construction has started on them. A 3,000-square-foot speculative house on an unsold lot listed for $495,000 is nearing completion, and a 4,000-square-foot former camp dormitory has been renovated as a home by the developer and sold for $600,000.
Forest Beach was opposed by some South Shore property owners who hoped that the camp could become a public park.
The project will test the community's ability to attract a large number of buyers willing to invest half a million dollars or more in a second home.
A $500,000 five-story private house with a hot tub on the roof is being built in Grand Beach. It was designed for a Chicago doctor and his family by the Chicago architects Pappageorge/Haymes.
Even though construction of new houses continues, sales of existing homes have been slowed in the last year by the recession. Houses in the $500,000 to $700,000 range are not moving, said Gail Lowrie, a real estate broker in New Buffalo. However, smaller renovated cottages near Lake Michigan, priced around $100,000, have begun to sell again, she said.
"People have money but they are hesitating," she said. "If it's priced really well, they'll buy. But generally they are being prudent."
Summer cottages have been the area's standard historically. Pier One, an eight-cottage compound on one acre in Union Pier, is typical of the area's older building stock. Last year, the cottages, averaging 600 square feet and built in the 30's, were bought from their single owner for $140,000 by Spec Development of Chicago. They have been winterized and renovated and were put up for sale six months ago for $65,000 to $75,000. Two have been sold.
Rejuvenation of the South Shore began when the Army Corps of Engineers opened a channel to the New Buffalo harbor from the lake in 1979. Until then, the main activity in the harbor had been dredging by the Oselka family for detritus to make cement mix for its construction company.
Through their organization, New Buffalo Harbor, the Oselkas -- Paul and his twin sons Rolland and Ronald, plus a partner, Roccy DeFrancesco -- began to develop the harbor after the channel was cleared. They first sold 400 boat slips, which were bought largely by Chicago boaters. Ground was broken for the first South Cove condominiums in 1980. Many say that development attracted the attention of Chicagoans to the area once again.
Some buyers came back as early as 1983. That year, two Chicagoans, Ed and Jean Lawrence, bought and renovated an abandoned 1912 bed and breakfast called the Pebble House in Lakeside. All seven rooms are now taken for July and August, and most of the guests are from Chicago.
In 1986, the infant market was stalled by high lake levels that obliterated beaches, eroded the shoreline and threatened some lakefront houses. When the water receded and beaches came back a year later, property sold rapidly. Cottages that cost $25,000 in the late 80's now are selling for $60,000.

HEADLINE: Grimly, Graduates Are Finding Few Jobs

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER

 BODY:
CORPORATE recruiting on most college campuses in Westchester declined this spring, and for the latest graduates the job search is harder than it has been in years.
"I filled out 11 job applications, had seven interviews and so far I've been turned down by six companies," said a 21-year-old communications major who graduated this month. He would not allow his name to be published because he feared he might sound like a "loser." 
 "The only comfort I have," he said, "is that none of my friends are having luck finding a job either. But I remember that five years ago, when my brother was graduating, he was recruited on campus and had three good job offers in his pocket when he graduated. That was boom time. This is bust time."
Most young job seekers would agree. Fewer jobs are being offered to new college graduates this year. In industries like banking, jobs have been cut drastically.
"We're still recruiting but with a difference," said Anne Schmidt, a human resources officer at the National Westminster Bank USA in White Plains. "We were at the job fair at the Iona campus in Yonkers, and we were talking to graduates, but we are staffing only with part-timers.
"We told the college graduates that we tried to think of the part-time jobs as an opportunity to learn banking. And we've also told them that they'll be considered for full-time positions when such positions become available, as our policy is to promote from within."
At Manhattanville College in Purchase, Karen Ganz, the director of the career service office, said: "We had two weekends of on-campus recruiting but with fewer companies attending. Some companies, such as Chemical Bank, that we've had great success with in the past, canceled at the last minute."
The economy was a factor, Ms. Ganz said, but she also explained that the past approach of recruiting on-campus has diminished and been replaced by the jobs fair. Manhattanville, for instance, is part of a five-college consortium that holds a jobs fair for its graduates every year.
 
'We Banded Together'
 "We banded together with SUNY Purchase, Sarah Lawrence and the two Marymount campuses, one in Westchester and one in New York, for our common good, employment for our graduating seniors," Ms. Ganz said. "We held two jobs fairs early in the year, one at Marymount at the Manhattan campus and the other at Manhattanville in Westchester."
Thirty-eight companies paid $50 each to recruit prospective employees. "The big change wasn't in the number of companies attending, but rather in the number of jobs they had to offer," Ms. Ganz said. "Instead of a company that had five positions last year, there were two this year." But she said some seniors had received firm job offers.
"United Parcel recruited three management trainees, two women and a man," she said. "The starting salaries were good, in the mid-$20,000 range. They begin by driving a United Parcel truck for three months."
 
A More Optimistic Note
 A law firm hired a legal assistant, a publishing house hired an editorial assistant and an insurance company "took one of our seniors to be trained as an underwriter," Ms. Ganz added.
Students may have to work harder to start their careers, but Mary P. Raymond, director of career services at Iona's two campuses, in New Rochelle and Yonkers, said the gloom-and-doom portrayal of the job market was overblown.
"There are those students who tap into that negative way of thinking and that becomes their excuse for not aggressively pursuing employment opportunities," Ms. Raymond said. "Liberal arts graduates and non-career business majors, such as those in management and marketing who lack well-defined objectives, are having the most trouble getting jobs."
Ms. Raymond said companies came to Iona's early spring career fairs in record number.
"Despite charging companies a $30 fee to attend the career fair this year, we still had a 15 percent increase in companies who attended over last year," when there was no fee, she said. But there were fewer job offers than in other years.
"Even though they didn't have jobs, we found that companies came to promote their visibility.The Big Six accounting firms were all represented, and some of our students did receive firm job offers from them. Insurance firms had jobs and so did some of the banks."
 
There's Always Grad School
 Some Iona students, discouraged about their job search, have applied to graduate schools. "I don't think that is a good option," Ms. Raymond said, "because it just prolongs getting into the job process."
A better idea for those students without jobs after graduation, she said, is to work as a volunteer. "Peace Corps and other volunteer groups offer experiences that sometimes lead to a career and salaried job," Ms. Raymond said. "We think so highly of that option that next year we're planning a service fair along the lines of the job fair."
She stressed that graduates use a variety of job-search techniques.
"I tell them it's not enough to put together a resume and to answer a few ads," she said. "Networking, telling friends and acquaintances that you need a job, is probably one of the best approaches for getting one."
Students, Ms. Ganz said, are required to attend class to learn how to put together a resume and how to conduct themselves in an interview.
"We show them all the techniques they can use to get a job," she said. "Our career service programs are open to our alumni as well, and the requests for job-interview information from alumni are creeping up, which is a reflection of the economy."
At Iona, the number of alumni using the college career service has also increased, Ms. Raymond said. "There are so many alums in their 40's out of work and in debt because of mergers and downsizing that we've started a support group for them, which meets on campus."
But some alumni are in a position to help. "Some supply jobs when they can and others phone in with job leads and share information," she said.
Robert Bierman, the employer relations consultant for the Hudson Valley region of the New York Department of Labor, said that the job market for professional and managerial white-collar workers is tight because of the slowdown in the financial industry in New York City.
"It has a ripple effect in Westchester," Mr. Bierman said. "What's happening this year is that people with a lot of experience are taking entry-level jobs and competing with the newly graduated. We see a dramatic increase in unemployment, judging from the claims we're paying out in the white-collar managerial level. The recession has hit this particular segment of the market very hard."
At Mercy College, Marguerite A. Busetti, director of career services, said that despite "a job market as tight as I have ever seen," 42 companies had recruited at Mercy's main campus at Dobbs Ferry this spring, only three fewer than in the year before.
"We've built up a rapport with companies who recruit our graduates," she said. "And although they don't have as many jobs available this year, there were jobs."
Mercy seniors were recruited largely by accounting firms, computer companies, retail stores, insurance companies and nonprofit agencies, she said.
 
Internships as a First Step
 Ann Novotnick, the employment manager at Bloomingdale's in White Plains and the store's representative at Mercy College, said campus recruiting had been an excellent way to find good employees.
"I go to all the Westchester college job fairs," Ms. Novotnick said. "We're already in the process of interviewing 10 people whom I spoke with at the Mercy job fair, and we've already hired five College of New Rochelle graduates for various positions in sales and management."
She advised students interested in a career in retailing to try interning before graduation. "Several undergraduates who have worked as interns for us have landed very good jobs with the store after graduation," she said.
D. Bradford Mills, branch manager of the copier division at the Pitney-Bowes district office in White Plains, also recruited on the Manhattanville campus. "I spoke with some very talented men and women at Manhattanville for positions that we have open as sales representatives," he said. "I'm still talking to some of them, and possibly that will result in some actual jobs. Our sales are slower, but our customers are still buying and we do need good people."

THE BIRTH OF THE MODERN
World Society 1815-1830.
By Paul Johnson.
1,095 pp. New York:
HarperCollins Publishers. $35.  
 "Modern" derives from the Latin modo, meaning "recently" or "just now." "Modernity," as used pejoratively of course, dates from the mid-19th century. But no one knows quite when, in modern times, the modern was born: in the 17th century, when certain assertive intellectuals began to look on recent achievements as superior to past doings; in the 18th century, when change was widely equated with progress; or in the 19th century, when acceleration of change became the order of the day. In "The Birth of the Modern," Paul Johnson -- professional iconoclast, author of many books, including "Modern Times," and once editor of London's New Statesman -- argues for the 15 years after 1815, and his case is as strong (or as weak) as any other, though more entertaining than most.
He opens his thousand-page tale with two victories: that of Andrew Jackson over the British at New Orleans in 1815 and that of Wellington over the French at Waterloo the same year. The one inaugurated the "special relationship" confirmed by the Treaty of Ghent; the other confirmed British supremacy over the century. Their conjunction marks Mr. Johnson's underlying theme of a world society led into modernity by English-speaking nations that dominate the rest. In the age of steam and coal and iron, this makes good sense; the industrial, cultural and political revolutions of the 19th century were forged there and in France, and exported from these centers.
Modernity aborning is not just about things, but about access to things. Art galleries open to the public are a creation of the French Revolution and of Napoleonic conquests. Royal collections in the Louvre had been opened in 1793; the Accademia in Venice, the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, the Brera in Milan and the Uffizi in Florence are due to initiatives taken by local administrations established by the French during the Napoleonic era. The Prado in Madrid and the National Gallery in London followed suit when Napoleon was gone.
Art and commercialism advanced together. Mass production of pianos, the tonal volume and sonority of new instruments with iron frames, the growing number of young people practicing their scales, the brilliance of Beethoven's sound -- all went with a growing middle-class audience, more music written for the commercial market, more middle-class artists (Schubert, Berlioz, Mendelssohn, Chopin) serving an increasingly middle-class public. New deeds suggested new words. Wider access to cultural activities prompted Mme. de Stael to coin the term "vulgarity," and German intellectuals to denounce "philistines," just as wider access to travel moved Byron to coin the contemptuous "tourism."
In the 18th century, romances and prose fictions had become novels. By the early 19th century, Jane Austen, daughter of a clergyman, could describe her family as all "great Novel-readers & not ashamed of being so." Soon book sales turned to mass sales, part of a wider commodity market that made affordable what had shortly before been costly. And circulating libraries -- an 18th-century Scottish invention that quickly spread -- made reading more common still.
The technology that helped turn out more goods more cheaply helped to sell them too, Mr. Johnson shows. New shopping arcades sheltered shops with plate glass windows for display; mass advertising rose to serve mass production by urging mass consumption. The revolution of expectations that advertising prompted would, in due course, be matched by a visual revolution that belongs in the second part of the century, when poster art and other forms made not only art but avant-garde art available to ordinary people. Meanwhile, late 18th-century technology transformed the visual expectations of more and more men and women. Limelight (Argand lamps) announced new technologies of vision (dioramas and so on), while gas illuminated London streets, and theaters even more. Possibilities seemed unlimited. Shelley (who planned to explore Africa by balloon) wrote about space travel powered by electricity. His bride, as we all know, gave us the first science fiction novel, "Frankenstein."
Mr. Johnson provides much fascinating information on the scientific and technological progress that inspired such fantasies while it turned luxuries into necessities, at least at the middle levels of society: better roads, cheaper shoes and clothes, steam pumps and engines, steamboats, lithography, omnibuses, but also the rubberized raincoats Charles Macintosh began to mass-produce in 1824. And while steam revolutionized mining, manufacture and travel, steam presses revolutionized printing and launched a newspaper industry, public opinion politics, even, before long, a Fourth Estate. Their contribution to the just-now age was not far off (electric telegraphs began to function in the 1840's). But the French Revolution of 1830, which put an end to the post-Napoleonic Bourbon restoration, does seem, as Mr. Johnson maintains, the first time the news media overthrew a government.
All this was halting and uncertain. If public transport improved, most people still walked: 20 miles was nothing. Lincoln once walked 34 miles just for the pleasure "of hearing a lawyer make a speech," Mr. Johnson writes, quoting from Carl Sandburg. And if goods were becoming less scarce (for some), pain was as rife as ever. Medicine was barely finding its feet, or its prestige. Anesthesia lay in the future. Until the 1840's and 50's, when nitrous oxide gas, ether and chloroform began to be used, surgery placed a premium on speed, and surgical training a premium on snatching bodies for future surgeons to practice on. Pain not subject to surgical intervention depended on drugs -- mostly opiates; and Quakers, later to specialize in chocolate manufacture, made fortunes selling laudanum, paregoric and stronger stuff.
Every "improvement" carried both promise and threat. Urban sprawl bred slums (the word appears in the 1820's). Pollution too: in Edinburgh, said the poet laureate Robert Southey, "you might smoke bacon by hanging it out of the window." Greater traffic brought deafening noise, vast traffic jams and parking problems that, in turn, suggested "carriage parks." Reaction to urban problems inspired a retreat to nature, the cult of gardens, the vogue of "rustic" garden furniture. It also reinforced an escape into history and the myth of simpler, purer, more natural ages.
The early 19th century continued "overawed by distance," as an Australian put it. The first long-distance railway only appeared in 1830. Yet steam, which radically cut the costs of sea travel, accelerated not only migration from Europe but also colonization. Shallow draft steamboats conquered the world's rivers, and many carried guns that fired the devastating antipersonnel shells invented in 1803 by Col. Henry Shrapnel for use against Napoleon. The age of gunboat diplomacy opens in 1825 off the west coast of Africa and, characteristic of the age, the gunboat's task is to discourage the slave trade.
The age of wars of national liberation, of massacres and countermassacres, of anti-European propaganda and anticolonial rhetoric dawned in Latin America around 1810, and much of a chapter called "Masques of Anarchy" is devoted to its sickening story. There, as in Greece -- grave of many illusions -- or later in Italy, nationalists depended on foreign aid, or on the incompetence of the power they challenged. In the end, as Simon Bolivar declared in 1830 when he was sick of it, "he who sows a revolution ploughs the sea."
Mankind, as Mr. Johnson contends, was turning (just beginning to turn) into a global community. One result he does not mention is that mankind's relations, less limited by distance than before, were turning into global conflict. But conflict could be found nearer home. Mr. Johnson's last chapter is titled "The Coming of the Demos." The 1820's experienced new degrees of political tension and terrorism. In France even theater claques were politicized, while operas and plays reflected political conflict and spurred it. Everywhere, economic problems encouraged radicalism and upheaval. Yet everywhere in the West the politics of oligarchy tolerated degrees of violence and vituperation that we would never stomach. In England, when fists and missiles rested, words took their place; witness Byron's epitaph on Castlereagh, the Minister he loathed:
 
 Posterity will ne'er survey
 A nobler grave than this;
 Here lie the bones of Castlereagh:
 Stop, traveller, . . .
In the United States, meanwhile, the first national smear campaign, whose venom was said to have killed Andrew Jackson's wife, did not prevent Jackson from being elected in 1828 -- the country's first modern President. In that context Jackson becomes an iconic figure associated with the rise of the Democratic Party and the spoils system, but also with American democratic rudeness and a meddling moralism out to improve the world while concealing unpleasantness behind euphemisms: "help" for servants, "peculiar institution" for slavery. Nothing much has changed, it seems. In 1828, a letter from the White House took five days to reach Martin Van Buren in New York; it would not take much longer today.
Much of Mr. Johnson's presentation is debatable, not because his anecdotes fail to illuminate or his facts to tell, but because their evidence applies to narrow social and geographical areas. Britain, France, the upper classes and the upper middle classes provide most of the record. And not all of that is flawless. The German Sturm und Drang of the 1770's was not directed against Napoleon's armies. The painter Jacques-Louis David was not sentenced to exile after Waterloo; he chose it. In French, taille -- a poll tax -- does not mean "to pull," but to cut, clip or notch. French women's literacy in 1848 was nowhere near 80 percent (nor to 60 percent in 1830 either). And cleanliness was no characteristic of the 1820's, even in England. Over 100 years later, I found the English middle classes oddly grubby and mistrustful of warm baths.
Nevertheless, Mr. Johnson serves us a savory social history, spiced with lively gossip. He moves fast but is easy to follow. He insists on the intimate connection of literature and politics, on the interplay among literature, philosophy, science and art at the birth of the modern world, and he embodies the phenomena he describes in personalities. The book is a mosaic of brisk cameos (thus Bonaparte at St. Helena, "round and white, like a china pig"). And, though his book is hefty, it is never dull. In many ways a tour de force.
 
WHY HISTORY IS LIKE A RAILROAD
 Paul Johnson, who spends 1,000 pages in his new book arguing that "the modern" was born between 1815 and 1830, acknowledges that critics might disagree. "I don't want to push this assumption too far," the 62-year-old former journalist and author of two dozen books said during a recent telephone interview from his home in the tiny British hamlet of Over Stowey in Somerset. "But it's difficult to think of any aspect of human existence that didn't change radically during these 15 years. I don't think you get this concentration and variety in any other period."
Among changes he mentioned were the beginnings of organized sport and long-distance travel, the development of an international artistic culture and the institution of precursors of the Russian gulags. "Also, those 15 years were absolutely vital in the rest of the world," he said. "In America, the settlement of the West was beginning. In South America, the Spanish Empire was breaking up. And Russia was expanding into Asia." He said this "crowded book" took 10 years of research, "but it's the book I've enjoyed writing most because there were so many interesting people to try to bring to life."
He is deeply committed to popular social history. "I was anxious to show how ordinary people were affected by these changes," he said. "What I try to do is like the 'total history' of the French Annales school. But they tend to write static history, while I believe that one should convey the sense of history rumbling along like a railroad."
Creating big historical works, becoming enthralled with the cast of characters, is exciting, he said, but so is all history; "history is like being on an ocean liner, churning up the past behind while you push ahead, not really knowing what will be there." But he does know what work is ahead for him -- another grand project, he said, "a history of the American people." -- ANDREW L. YARROW

HEADLINE: Supply-Siders Persist in Their Errors

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"We're All Better Off for Reagan's Tax Reforms" by Jude Wanniski (letter, June 6) is another attempt by a supply-sider to perpetuate the myth that the Reagan tax reductions worked miracles for the American economy and that a cut in the capital gains tax would add to the benefits. 
 Mr. Wanniski tells us that the economy is one-third bigger than a decade ago "because of the Reagan reforms." What he does not report is that before the Reagan reforms the United States economy grew even faster: 45 percent in the 1960's and 32 percent in the 1970's, compared with 30 percent in the 80's.
He tells us that the Reagan tax reforms favored labor over capital, and that is why real income per capita has lagged in the "lower income classes" and "why so many jobs were created" in the 80's. Actually, employment grew by more in the two previous decades than in the last one. Moreover, it is difficult to understand why employers should hire more workers simply because those workers' income taxes have been cut.
Mr. Wanniski's main pitch is that the quickest way to increase the real incomes of the lower income classes would be to eliminate the tax on capital gains, "which would encourage capital formation faster than new jobs are supplied." Like the supply-siders' claims of a decade ago, none of which have materialized, the notion that business investment would increase significantly if the capital gains tax were repealed makes little sense. One only has to look at the income statements of major corporations and see how little of their earnings consist of capital gains.
If the argument is that stock prices would rise on elimination of the capital gains tax, and therefore the cost of equity financing would decrease, we need only note that the capital gains tax of 28 percent did not prevent the Dow Jones average from rising above 3,000 recently and the price-earnings ratio from increasing from 14 a year ago to about 20 recently.
Substituting zealotry for sound economics, Mr. Wanniski and his supply-side colleagues still miss no opportunity to peddle their discredited doctrines.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Magazines Seeing Signs Of Recovery

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
AN advance look at magazine advertising pages for September, an indicator of the economic health of the marketing and media industries, shows some signs the recession may be at or near an end.
But there are few Pollyannas among the publishing executives, and most said they thought that happy days might not really return until the first or second quarter of next year. 
 Publishers and ad directors at large national monthlies and bimonthlies, where publishing schedules necessitate selling September's ad pages by late June or early July, were informally surveyed about the outlook for the month.
September results are closely watched because at many a magazine, that month's issue carries the most ad pages of any during the year, since it comes at the beginning of the fall-to-Christmas shopping season.
"I wait 11 months for this issue," said Anne Sutherland Fuchs, publisher of Vogue, whose September issue often is as thick as a brick. While it is too early to announce a page count, she added, "We are predicting some softness."
Yet Ms. Fuchs took note of two telephone calls that she received the morning she was interviewed, from two marketers who were not expected to buy any September ad pages: One bought two pages while the other bought four pages.
"I'm never going to close this issue," Ms. Fuchs said jokingly.
Referring to a statement by Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, that the recession may already be over, or may end soon, James Hayes, publisher of Fortune magazine, said, "You can put my name right next to Greenspan." He added that things looked much better than they did two months ago. "For the past six weeks, we've made our weeks," he said, referring to ad pages that tied or exceeded the levels of the same week a year earlier.
Even so, said Jack Kliger, publisher of Glamour, magazine ad pages are rarely "a first sign of a recession bottoming out," because of the lead time required to commit ad dollars to print media. "This fall does not look like anything people are going to jump up and down about," he said. "We're fighting to maintain share and build that."
September ad pages for the 14 titles of Hearst Magazines will decline by close to 10 percent from last September's levels, said Charlotte Kelly Veal, a spokeswoman. "We know that as an industry we lag coming out of a recession," she continued, "so we are projecting a stronger picture for the second quarter of 1992, but not before then."
And Michael A. Clinton, publisher of GQ magazine, said, "I don't think we are seeing any aggressive movement in terms of advertisers coming back with big schedules yet." While some of his largest retail advertisers "are having a good year, like the Gap and Merry-Go-Round," he added, "things are still spotty."
Yet at Money, September now looks "to be up over last year by about nine pages," said Betsy Martin, advertising sales director. She continued: "It's not a lot, but as we say, up is up. I'm Irish, so I don't like to be too optimistic and press my luck, but we think maybe the worst is over."
Also becoming more cheerful is Michael Golden, publisher of McCall's. Though his September issue does not close until this week, it appears that ad pages will finish even with those of a large special issue last September. "Anytime we're even with last year this year, it's a good sign," he said. "I'm getting to the optimistic side, and I was not there before."
At the Meredith Corporation, Better Homes and Gardens expects September ad pages to increase at least 10 percent, said a spokesman, Rick Phillips, and Midwest Living estimates a similar gain for its September/October issue. And The Ladies' Home Journal is projecting "the largest September in our history," its publisher, Donna Galotti, said. She estimated her ad-page increase at 9 percent 17 percent.

HEADLINE: G. W. Hobbs 3d, 85; Ran Group on Aging

 BODY:
G. Warfield Hobbs 3d, a former chairman of the National Committee on the Aging, died on Saturday in Longwood, Fla. He was 85 years old and moved there last year after living in both Stonington, Conn., and Englewood, Fla., for two decades.
He died of cancer of the liver, his wife, Helen, said. 
 Mr. Hobbs retired in 1965 as a Manhattan-based vice president of the First National City Bank of New York, now Citibank, part of Citicorp.
Under his leadership, the Committee on Aging provided information and counseling in areas like health, employment, retirement and social welfare.
In a speech in 1957, Mr. Hobbs contended that thousands of scientists and engineers were being forced to retire when they could be performing vital national services. And in testimony before a New York State legislative committee in 1953, he warned that rapid expansion of pension systems could harm the American economy.
Mr. Hobbs was born and grew up in Baltimore. He earned a bachelor's degree at Johns Hopkins University in 1928 and then joined the bank, where he headed the pension trust division from 1938 until he retired. He served in the Army Air Forces in World War II.
Besides his wife, the former Helen I. Miller, Mr. Hobbs is survived by a daughter, Susan Connell of North Stonington; two sons, G. Warfield 4th, of New Canaan, Conn., and William, of Milwaukee, and four grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Machine Tools Orders Fell 19.6% in May

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
Orders for American-made machine tools fell in May for a third straight month, dropping 19.6 percent from the April level, an industry trade group said in a monthly report being released today.
The drop comes in spite of predictions by makers of machine tools and the industry trade group, the Association for Manufacturing Technology, that industry orders would generally improve as American businesses began spending to upgrade their manufacturing plants. 
 Analysts interpreted the May figures as evidence that capital spending continues to show little sign of rebounding and that the nation's economy remains in a recession despite recent signs of recovery.
 
Lowest Since 1987
 In its report, the association said new orders for machine tools fell to $155.8 million in May from $193.7 million in April. It was the lowest monthly new-order total since August 1987, when it was $142 million. New orders in May were also 24.5 percent below the level of May 1990. For the first five months of this year, machine tool orders are down 13.6 percent from a year earlier.
Machine tools are used to cut or shape metal parts used in durable products like appliances, automobiles, aircraft and building components. The level of orders and shipments of machine tools is considered an important indicator of the health of American industry.
"There seems to be a reluctance on the part of manufacturers to upgrade their facilities," said Richard O. Priebe, a spokesman with Cross & Trecker Inc., a large machine tool maker that earlier this month agreed to be acquired by a competitor, Giddings & Lewis Inc. "Manufacturers seemed to be sitting tight right now," Mr. Priebe said. "It reflects a general weakness in the economy, and that caused manufacturers to delay their purchases."
Larry W. Hollis, an analyst with Robert W. Baird & Company, a brokerage in Milwaukee, said the May figures reflected weakness in the economy. "In recessions, orders are generally slow," Mr. Hollis said. He added that the May report indicated that foreign machine tool makers, particularly those in Japan, "continue to make significant inroads in American market share." He added that foreign machine tool producers "now have about half of the domestic market."
 
Link to Factory Use
 Despite the weakness of new orders in recent months, Albert W. Moore, president of the Association for Manufacturing Technology, said he remained encouraged by recent data from the Federal Reserve showing two consecutive months of higher factory utilization. "Conventional wisdom in our industry is that machine tool orders escalate when capacity utilization crosses the 80 percent level," Mr. Moore said.
"Manufacturers also have tigher control over their inventories now than in most downturns," he added. "With lean inventories, production will respond quickly to higher demand, in turn creating demand for the machine tool which will be needed to meet new production levels."
Machine tool orders have been hurt by the economic woes of automobile makers, which typically account for more than a third of the industry's new orders. And some analysts suggest that a pickup of new orders from car makers, who are expected to retool soon for new models, will help stimulate new orders for machine tools.
 
Strong Foreign Demand
 The May report also showed that orders from foreign customers dropped a sharp 54 percent from the previous month. Industry executives said that they could not account for that decline, but analysts suggested that it probably resulted from a large level of foreign orders in April.
Orders from foreign customers, which reached a record last year, were up 10.7 percent for the first five months of the year, while orders from domestic customers fell 18.9 percent in the same period. Orders from domestic customers were down 8.7 percent in May from the April rate.

Picking Issues: Dinkins's Crime, Koch's Housing

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
Whoever said talk is cheap never met the Mayor of New York.
A prisoner of his own oratory, Mayor David N. Dinkins sought last fall to end his sentence in political purgatory with a proposition: a four-year $1.8 billion "assault on all fronts" to redeem his campaign pledge to be the city's "toughest mayor on crime" and to compensate for what seemed to be his indifference to a surge in homicides over the summer, which prompted demands that he hire 5,000 more police officers. 
 Instead, after overdue deliberation, Mr. Dinkins proposed that the police force be expanded even more. He coupled the expansion with new resources for the rest of the criminal-justice system and with a more modest investment in preventive programs for youths.
The Mayor's proposal was pared by the City Council. But this week, as he tries to negotiate a budget for the fiscal year beginning on July 1, Mr. Dinkins's stubborn refusal to retreat further from his major tangible achievement has tied his hands. The spending and tax commitments he made to rescue his anti-crime plan earlier this year have wound up, as predicted, subordinating his other priorities in a budget that has been severely constrained by the recession.
Mr. Dinkins is hardly the first elected official to respond to political wind, even when he blew it himself. His promise of toughness was intended to defy a stereotype -- of a liberal who, as a Manhattan borough president, was more concerned with producing social programs for his constituents than more police officers.
Yet New York City's major discretionary spending during the last five years represented calculated political responses to substantive problems that a mayor's oratory compounded.
In 1986, Mayor Edward I. Koch unveiled a 10-year, $4.2 billion proposal to build or renovate tens of thousands of apartments. A "housing crisis," he said, had been precipitated by Federal parsimony. But a political crisis had been created by what many saw as an insensitivity to so cial problems, even as his tough talk on crime seemed to mask his administration's failure to reclaim the streets.
 "Koch had crime, in a certain sense, under control," David Garth, his political strategist, recalled. "What we were criticized for legitimately was the housing problem. Dinkins feels that his vulnerability is in law and order. Koch felt his was compassion."
Mr. Koch often characterized himself as a "liberal with sanity." The epiphany came early in Mr. Koch's first term, though, when he found that once he was a mayor he could not afford to impose programs he had advocated for urban America when he was a Congressman.
Mr. Dinkins's metamorphoses seemed even more pronounced. Less than two days after his inaugural address, when he repeated his pledge to be the toughest mayor on crime, a higher priority took precedence: he postponed planned police hiring to help close a yawning deficit. His decision was applauded at the time, in part because it addressed another of his vulnerabilities: perceived fiscal imprudence. Yet it would haunt him as crime climbed over the summer.
"If the No. 1 issue people were thinking about was crime and drugs and we were not addressing it," Deputy Mayor Bill Lynch said, "then we couldn't make happen some of the things the Mayor was talking about, like reducing infant mortality and promoting racial harmony."
Mr. Koch boldly addressed the housing issue when the economy was flush. He relied heavily on the city's construction budget without impinging on operating funds. But, like Mr. Dinkins's police plan, the housing blueprint may have been well intentioned but somewhat shortsighted.
Advocates for housing, said Andrew Cuomo, whose HELP program builds transitional housing for the homeless, "let government off the hook" by their own political calculation to focus largely on the physical needs of the poor without acknowledging that many homeless people also require a welter of social services, too.
"Nobody was coming back into the housing business," Mr. Koch recalled. "Abandoned buildings with enormous value were deteriorating. There were new programs where you could bring in private-sector dollars. And, finally, you had every editorial beating you up."
Wasn't his response analogous to Mr. Dinkins's? "Mine was sensible; his was not," Mr. Koch said. "As much as any one of us wants more cops, you cannot make cops the World Trade Center and everything else in the budget becomes a brownstone."
Mr. Koch's housing program was insufficient to win him a fourth term. And Mr. Dinkins's police plan may not win him re-election. But it has managed so far to discourage and deflect further criticism that he does not care about crime.
In a democracy, elected officials are supposed to chart a course between political pragmatism and opportunism in responding to the winds of change. But if the ship of state turns out to be a sailboat, then the navigator needs to know when to tack.

HEADLINE: Gap Finds Middle Road to Success

BYLINE: By ISADORE BARMASH

 BODY:
The Gap Inc., which became a successful chain in the early 80's with casual clothing like unisex jeans, T-shirts and denim jackets, is doing even better in the 90's by separating the sexes and widening its appeal.
The Gap still sells jeans but has added a broader assortment and greater range of colors in clothing like blouses and dresses. In doing so, the company took a risk that it could keep its regular customers and add new ones. 
 It was right. So right, in fact, that the Gap has become one of retailing's rare superstars, one with consistent double-digit sales gains even in the midst of a recession.
Hoping to keep that momentum going, the company started a new and unusual television advertising campaign last week. With the theme "For every generation there's a Gap," the ads feature relatively little Gap clothing and even show people wearing clothes that are not from the Gap line. The television ads will complement the Gap's celebrity-sprinkled "Individuals of style" ads that have appeared mostly in magazines since 1988. Industry analysts and retailing executives say the Gap owes much of its success to its bold move to establish the Gap name as a brand amid the proliferation of fashion labels.
"The Gap achieved outstanding results with the right merchandise," Stacy Ruchlamer, a retail analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers, New York, wrote in a report after seeing the Gap's overall sales rise 33 percent in May. "The Gap has developed a superior concept of offering fashionable basics for many Americans. The Gap has the potential for substantial growth because it serves a huge market -- young, middle-aged to more mature adults -- with very little competition."
To be sure, the San Bruno, Calif., company is not flawless. Its biggest problem remains its Banana Republic unit, the once-hot, safari-type clothing chain that ran out of steam about 1987. An attempt to start a chain called Hemisphere, with more stylish clothes for affluent shoppers, failed last year.
After shifting to more general newer-fashion sportswear, Banana Republic has shown progress, and company executives seem optimistic that it can climb back to high-profit levels.
Retailing industry analysts credit Donald G. Fisher, the Gap's founder and chief executive, and Millard S. Drexler, its president, with making the 950-store company defy the laws of retailing gravity. Mr. Fisher, is an entrepreneur who built a successful big business but who realized that he needed a proven merchandiser like Mr. Drexler to help put new strategies into place.
 
Strong Same-Store Sales
 Last year, the company had sales of $1.93 billion, up from $1.58 billion. More impressive, in the latest reporting period sales at Gap stores open at least a year, known as "same-store sales," rose 15 percent, about three times the industry average. For the first four months of this year, total sales were $655 million, up 25 percent; same-store sales rose 8 percent.
Adding to the Gap's success are the 170 GapKids stores and the newer, 50 BabyGap departments, both of which have attracted new customers. This year, about 150 new stores are planned, including 25 new Banana Republic units and 50 GapKids stores in the United States, Britain and Canada.
Mr. Fisher boasts that the Gap label is the second-best-selling brand in American clothing, after Levi Strauss and ahead of Benetton and Liz Claiborne.
Mr. Drexler describes the Gap's wares as "not high-risk fashion, but good taste, good style; not too far to the left, not too far to the right."
What seems to differentiate Gap sportswear from most rival offerings is the extensive color palette, ranging from basic black and white to pale beiges to deep maroons to vivid blues. The prices are usually lower than those charged by department stores. The combined effect is that when shoppers find items like polo shirts at $24.50 to $34, they are tempted to buy them in several colors.
Customers who filled the Gap store at 445 Fifth Avenue at 39th Street in Manhattan on Thursday, said the company offered more comfortable, basic styles, a wider selection and at better prices than other stores.
"I like the Gap for its shorts, polos and jeans because the styling appeals to me," said Deidre Egan, a student at New York University. "Their clothes are more comfortable than what I find elsewhere. I do shop in other places, but I always try to include the Gap."
Barbara Debois, of Baldwin, L.I., said she had bought a lot of clothes for her husband in the store.
"I've been shopping at the Gap for at least five years," she said. "Their colors are attractive, and I like very much their mix-and-match sportswear."
Another woman who said she was a "retailing professional" but refused to give her name or that of her company, said she had noticed the Gap's shift. "They've really developed their own niche," she said. "Their colors are a little bit ahead of everyone else's, and their prices are low."
 
Named for Generation Gap
 When Mr. Fisher, an engineer, started the Gap in 1969, he named it for the much-discussed generation gap. A dozen years later, the company had 150 stores with sales of $417 million and earnings of $11.8 million. In the next decade -- Mr. Drexler joined the company in 1983 -- it quadrupled its sales and increased its net income eightfold.
"I was looking for the right person," Mr. Fisher recalled, "and decided that he might be at the best-run specialty chain, the Ann Taylor stores." Mr. Drexler added: "Actually, Don and I were ready to start a new business together in New York because I really didn't want to move to California. But in order to generate such a new startup, the Gap had to do better. So I agreed to go there for three years, and then I decided to stay."
In helping to transform the company, Mr. Drexler has also become one of the highest paid and, because of very generous stock options, one of the wealthiest retail executives in America.
According to the company's proxy statement dated April 26, Mr. Drexler received total compensation of nearly $1.9 million in 1990, practically the same as Mr. Fisher, who is also the chairman. Mr. Drexler's Gap stock holdings as of April 2, amounted to just over two million common shares, or 2.9 percent of the shares outstanding, the proxy says. Valued at $60.375 a share, those holdings are worth more than $123 million.
 
Stress Own Brand
 In becoming its own brand, one of the Gap's most significant changes, Mr. Fisher and Mr. Drexler said, was their decision to drop all rival brands other than Levi, which accounts for about 7 percent of the Gap's merchandise. As evidence of how well that policy has worked, fashion magazines now refer to a Gap cotton shirt when suggesting outfits the same way they do a DKNY blouse or Guess? denim jacket.
"That plan put us in a unique position for a retailer," Mr. Fisher said. "We are the only American retailer of any size with its own brand name on such a dominating share of our business."
When he arrived at the Gap, Mr. Drexler found a major retailer of Levi's that was trying to diversify and broaden itself. The Gap carried as many as 15 different national brands of clothes. Its merchandising approach for getting all those labels out of the stores was to offer "sale" prices every day. But this constant diet of price-cutting proved inconsistent.
Also, as the 80's wore on, the Gap's management gradually noticed some disaffection by women shoppers. Many seemed to feel the unisex look was dominated by men's styling.
 
'Just Plain Ugly'
 "What troubled me especially," recalled Mr. Drexler, "was that the taste level of the merchandise was, well, just plain ugly. The stuff was trendy but not tasteful and the quality was not what I would have liked. The problem was that we were running a margin-driven business based on price. There was no real, bright future in that."
So, in 1987, the Gap set up separate collections for men and women. It doubled its product development staff to create separate units to develop each line. And it more than doubled the number of styles for women.
Mainly though, styling was shifted to "simpler, cleaner lines, all in natural fibers " said John Fumiati, Gap's product development chief.
But true to its something-for-everybody theme, the Gap still carries some unisex clothes for those who like them -- in its men's department.

HEADLINE: Life on the Bottom Line: How Dinkins's Budget Affects Social Services

 BODY:
Sheena Craig, a 32-year-old home-care attendant with no health insurance, walked out of an outpatient pharmacy at Kings County Hospital Center in Brooklyn last Wednesday clutching two plastic bottles of pills -- one for treating a fallopian-tube infection, the other to kill the pain.
Alexis Suter, 28, an unemployed singer who is eight months pregnant, came in for vitamins, and Valerie Dawson, 67, a housecleaner, picked up the $320 worth of prescriptions she needs every month to control high blood pressure and diabetes. 
 The women, like thousands of other New Yorkers, get their medicines and vitamins free through a city program for those unable to pay. But that service may come to an end. With the city facing its worst financial crisis since the 1970's, all 28 pharmacies in the city's public hospitals and clinics are scheduled to close their doors next week. The savings: $30 million.
The closing of the pharmacies, if it happens, will tear a large hole in the city's social safety net. But it is only one of scores of cuts in social services -- from the complete elimination of city dental services and a highly successful infant mortality program to deep cuts in school health programs, drug treatment and shelters for the mentally ill -- included in the fine print of Mayor David N. Dinkins proposed $29 billion budget for the fiscal year that begins July 1.
 
Cuts Across the Board
 The social-service reductions are among a broad array of cuts that the Mayor has proposed in virtually every agency, from parks to sanitation, to help close a budget gap of at least $3.5 billion. Only the Police and Fire Departments would be largely spared.
Some proposed social-service cuts will undoubtedly be carried out -- along with tax increases and cuts in other services that benefit the middle class -- to help the city get through a difficult period. Others were mainly intended to prod the State Legislature, the City Council and municipal unions to come up with alternatives to avert them.
The Legislature is bogged down in its own budget mess, and the municipal unions have not yet agreed to concessions. The Council, though, anxious to test its broad powers under the new City Charter, is close to completing a budget-cutting plan of its own. It would trim services even more.
The details of the Council's plan are not yet available. But in seeking to avoid higher property taxes, the Council wants to cut another $476 million from the Dinkins budget, which already calls for $1.5 billion in cuts.
Mr. Dinkins and Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone are quick to blame one another for the need to cut services.
"I don't want to lose these programs any more than you do -- all these programs are important," Mr. Dinkins told a group of parents and poverty workers gathered on the steps of City Hall last week.
 
Loss of Matching Funds
 Though details are unclear, cuts seem certain and pain is already being felt. With just a week before the start of the fiscal year, it may be increasingly difficult for Mr. Dinkins to reverse the momentum he created.
This would leave Mr. Dinkins -- a Mayor elected on the promise of doing more for the people in the city's most troubled neighborhoods -- presiding over cuts that could fundamentally alter the relationship between New York City government and the poor. The city has a long, if rumpled, tradition of doing more for the poor than many other local governments, and the cuts would choke off many of those efforts.
And city reductions of $278 million in health and human services would be magnified by another $207 lost in state and Federal matching funds. Even Philip R. Michael, the city's budget director, acknowledged that some of proposed cuts are counterproductive and could eventually increase costs because they decimate services, like children's health programs and drug treatment, that are meant to avoid future problems.
Whatever the financial consequences, Mr. Dinkins's 275-page budget proposal lists page after page of "service reductions" in dry bureaucratic language. But behind each line item lies a human story.

HEADLINE: Pomp, Circumstance and Pessimism: Awaiting Hard Knocks After School

BYLINE: By WILLIAM CELIS 3d, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, June 19

 BODY:
Confetti and cheers showered the 335 seniors when they graduated today from Abraham Lincoln High School here. But beneath the euphoria lay haunting worries among the graduates about the future.
Evangelia Notidis, 17 years old and the school's top student, fretted that the economy might undermine her efforts to pay for a medical career. 
 Bryan Mahoney, 19, worried that even with a college education he would be hard-pressed to match his parents' quality of life.
 
Laid Off and Looking for Work
 Nicole Dunnigan, 17, who was laid off earlier this year from a $220-a-week job as a part-time clerk at a real estate agency, has been unable to find other work. She wants to earn money for training to become a court stenographer.
Maureen Powers, 18, who plans to enter college in the fall, best summed up the anxiety felt by her classmates and many other high school graduating seniors around the country: "We're scared."
For good reason. A generation of young people has been pushed into the harshest economic climate any high school class has faced in at least 25 years, according to guidance counselors, economists, demographers and the parents of these students.
For starters, these young people have graduated into a recession that has resulted in widespread layoffs and chilled the creation of new jobs. The job market also continues to shift toward more skilled work in technology, aerospace and health care, which, while not necessarily requiring a college education, does require additional training.
Over all, the Bureau of Labor Statistics expects about 18 million new jobs to be created by the economy from 1988 through the year 2000, only about half the number created in the 12-year period through 1988.
And many of the new jobs will be highly technical, requiring skills beyond the reach of high school graduates who cannot get advanced training. At the same time, most of the unskilled jobs in manufacturing, which paid previous generations enough to support a style of life that included comfortable housing, no longer exist.
 
Housing Is the Hurdle
 Housing prices and rents, moreover, are now among the highest in this century, even when earlier periods are adjusted for inflation. And salaries, both for those with only high school diplomas and those with college degrees, have not kept pace with housing costs.
In 1967, the year many parents of this generation left high school, the average salary for all workers in the United States, including college graduates, was $6,845, according to the Census Bureau, a figure that is $26,786 when adjusted to 1990 dollars. In 1990, the average salary was $29,912, only slightly better and still far behind the rise in the cost of housing, medical care and some other living expenses.
"This generation will have less," said David Capuzzi, the assistant dean at the school of education at Portland State University in Oregon and a former president of the American Association for Counseling and Development. "More will buy their starter home at 40, while their parents bought theirs at 25. They know this, and it has discouraged them."
The shift in the job market seems certain to continue through 2000 as corporations move unskilled jobs to cheaper foreign labor markets. Even demographics have conspired against this generation. The generation of babies born after World War II, the oldest of whom are now in their 40's and some of whom are parents of this generation, have a stranglehold on jobs for at least 20 more years.
 
Good Jobs Move Away
 "There really is a hell of a difference between this class and that of their parents," said Harry C. Wilcox, the principal at Lincoln High School, who for 35 years has watched classes graduate from the ethnically and economically mixed school in Northeast Philadelphia. "The good jobs are moving farther away from the poor jobs, and there aren't any jobs in between. The kid who doesn't go to college won't be able to do as well as their mother or father."
Even those who do go to college are not assured of high-paying, fast-track jobs. For the last two years, college graduates have had to scale back their expectations in the face of a sharply reduced job market, primarily because of the recession.
It is still too early to get statistics on the number of high school graduates who will be going to college in the fall or those who will be seeking specialized training. But in interviews with about 50 graduates around the country, nearly all who are not heading for college said they hope to go to trade school to bolster their skills. Many of their parents were able to slip easily into the job market and begin earning money right away.
One of the few recent graduates to say he would be going straight to the workplace was Michael Arinwine, 17, a graduate of Manual Arts High School in Los Angeles.
"I'll go get a job," Mr. Arinwine said, although he is not yet sure where. "I know the economy ain't that bad. I know I can at least survive."
 
Some Find Reason for Optimism
 One of his classmates, Nia Foxx, is not convinced. "A lot of my friends are going to work in fast-food, but there's no way they can support a family or get anything they want in jobs like that," said Ms. Foxx, who is also 17. "These days, you have to have a college education to get anywhere in life."
To be sure, some students say there is reason for optimism. Miss Foxx plans to attend the University of California at Santa Cruz as a pre-law major, something she said she could not have done in another era because of discrimination. "I have a real chance as a female, a black female, to enter the law profession," she said. "This is not a chance previous generations had, and I can't see how I wouldn't take advantage of that."
Other students have turned to the armed forces, where they said they could learn a variety of skills easily transferable to private business. Wendy Martinez, 17, another graduate of Manual Arts High, decided to join the Army because she said it would assure her of a secure future.
And though the job market is tight, there are high-skilled jobs paying well that go begging for lack of qualified workers, including aerospace machinists and computer programers, said Nancy Hardy, the supervisor of the Salt Lake City Public Schools' department of guidance counselors and a former president of the American School Counselors Association.
 
'I'm Not Going to Worry'
 Maurice Palmer, 17, who graduated last week from Martin Luther King High School in Northwest Philadelphia, insisted in the face of evidence to the contrary that, while the job market is tight, "we have more opportunities than our parents." Mr. Palmer, who plans to pursue a career in banking, added, "I'm not going to worry."
But more often than not, pessimism and uncertainty are the prevailing moods of this generation of graduates, who believe that more education will not necessarily guarantee that they will match their parents' quality of life.
"This generation has a lot of problems," said Lindsey Williams, 18, who graduated last week from Sheepshead Bay High School in Brooklyn and plans to attend St. John's University in Queens this fall. "All I can do is hope and have a little bit of faith in myself."
Tracy Whitsett, who graduated this year from Houston's Memorial High School, plans to major in nuclear engineering at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque. The dour job forecasts for this decade prompted her to decide on nuclear engineering over her first choice, astrophysics, because she thinks it will give her a better chance of finding work.
 
More Going for Degrees
 The increased competitiveness, combined with unpromising job market projections, has prompted many more students who ordinarily would not have pursued higher education to do so.
"I think it was easier before," said Hiram Duarte, a graduate of Miami High School whose father was a laborer until an injury disabled him and whose mother finished only the fifth grade in Cuba. "With a strong attitude and a strong fist you could do anything. Now you can't do anything without a college education."
Mr. Duarte, who already works part-time and is looking for a second summer job to raise money for his college education, plans to attend Florida State University in January. He plans to work toward a teacher's certificate so he can teach woodworking in high school. In time, he wants to own several cabinet-making shops.
"You would never make enough now to buy a house and a raise a family without a college education," he said. "That is making me go to school. I want to come home at the end of the day carrying a briefcase in my hand rather than with a broken back."
 
Extra Efforts by Immigrants
 Other students who found school particularly taxing, especially those who were recent immigrants, made extra efforts to succeed because of the tougher job climate. Maria Garcia, a 20-year-old graduate of Manual Arts High School in Los Angeles, is a case in point.
"It was hard for me to come from Mexico only four years ago -- to learn the language, to learn the customs," said Miss Garcia, who plans to major in business in college. "But if I can graduate from high school only four years after coming to this country, and enter a college, I know I can succeed after college."
Parents and grandparents who celebrated the commencements of their children and grandchildren said they could only hope that this generation would navigate the uncertainties facing them.
"It looks like things are going backward," said Shirley Williams, shaking her head over the tightening, and changing, job market. Her grandson, Carl Williams, graduated last week from Abraham Lincoln High School in Philadelphia, and agreed with his grandmother when she said, "It's going to get worse before it gets better."

HEADLINE: Fewer Investors Find Haven in Gold

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Some of the world's most influential money managers have been recasting their views about gold's ancient role as a haven for wealth in times of uncertainty or crisis.
In commodities markets, coin shops, Swiss investment houses and in the minds of many disappointed investors, gold is no longer the hedge investment of choice, or lately even a very profitable one. 
 There are many reasons for gold's diminished role. For one thing, the world has changed: there is freer movement of capital, a greater number of alternative investments, a surge in gold production, a relaxation of East-West tensions and less threat of a worldwide financial crisis.
"Nothing persuades me that gold is a good investment," said Ted Arnold, a once-bullish metals specialist for Merrill Lynch & Company in London. "The performance over the years, no matter how long you have tracked it, has been pretty terrible except for some brief periods of time."
 
A New Role in Jewelry
 Long the ancient coin of the realm, gold was once the world's monetary standard, backing the value of currencies in the United States and elsewhere. The metal was an easily obtainable asset that was tradable anywhere. And it was portable.
Today, gold is used more in jewelry, which accounts for 71 percent of production, up from 45 percent 10 years ago. That makes gold behave more like a commodity whose prices fluctuate based on supply and demand.
The Persian Gulf crisis would have seemed the kind of international disruption that would have given gold's price a jolt. But when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, gold rallied only briefly, from $373.25 an ounce to $413.80 on Aug. 21, the highest price of the gulf crisis.
Prices then fell quickly. Gold edged up to more than $400 an ounce twice more, including just before the allied bombing began on Jan. 17, but wound up at $359.45 -- lower than when the gulf crisis began -- by the time a ceasefire was announced on Feb. 28. Gold closed in New York on Friday at $365.90 an ounce.
"Gold is competing with so many other products we can go to in a crisis," said Ian C. MacDonald, manager of precious metals at Credit Suisse in New York.
This month, the Swiss Bank Corporation, a leading investment adviser to institutions and wealthy individuals, concluded in a report that "gold is no longer the only port in the storm." And in many cases, the bank is not investing client funds in gold.
Also, a recently published review of the world's gold market by Gold Fields Mineral Services Ltd. of London, which publishes a statistical bible on world gold markets, notes a "worrying" downturn in investment demand for gold last year in the Far East, where gold has long been popular even when prices are weak, as they are now.
Now, many investment managers who recommend gold suggest it only as a contrarian investment, which moves in the opposite direction of other assets, to diversify a portfolio.
 
A Laggard Since 1975
 In fact, an investment in gold has been pretty much a loser, racking up a tepid average annual compounded return of 4.7 percent since 1975, when Americans were first allowed to own gold, through the end of last year.
That record lags just about everything from stocks of small companies, which rose by an average of 19.9 percent a year in the period, to Treasury bills, which registered an 8.1 percent average annual gain. In fact, the only investment gold bested was silver, which fell by an average of three-tenths of 1 percent a year.
Last year, gold prices averaged $383.59 an ounce, after adjusting for inflation. It was the lowest average annual price in 13 years and less than half the $835 record price gold touched briefly in January 1980, when double-digit interest rates and inflation reigned.
More significant, last year investment buying of gold fell by more than 50 percent in the Western world, according to the Gold Fields report.
One investor who fell prey to gold's allure is Dr. Jeffrey A. Fisher, a New Jersey physician turned author. In 1989, with the price rising, Dr. Fisher bought $10,000 worth of gold for about $410 an ounce. "When I bought it, everyone was predicting it would go up to $1,000," Dr. Fisher said. "I thought I was making a safe investment."
Dr. Fisher bought gold when the price was rising, a mistake many American investors make. Except for a rally to $423 an ounce in February 1990, gold has settled around $360 to $370 an ounce and Dr. Fisher has lost about 12 percent on his investment. He is still holding on, however, hoping that another rally will give him an opening to sell.
Gold's fading glow is a result of the globalization of world markets, the advent of 24-hour trading and the simple fact that gold prices have been in decline for years thanks partly to a 75 percent rise in production in the 1980's.
 
More Options Today
 Also, with capital moving more freely, investors have far more options today for hedging against inflation and world crises. They can buy futures contracts and options that allow them to hedge against financial risk; they can move their money out of their countries, and with computers, they can respond more quickly to crises.
"In the old days, gold was always a third-rate hedge, but it was the only hedge in town," Mr. Arnold of Merrill Lynch said.
Buying gold as an investment has declined along with the end of the cold war and the reduction in East-West tensions. "Gold is pretty worthless unless a catastrophe happens and then that is the only wealth you have to keep," said Laurence B. Siegel, managing director of Ibbotson Associates in Chicago, an economic consulting firm. Mr. Siegel is an advocate of gold as an addition to a portfolio for this "insurance" protection.
Inflation, long another reason to buy gold, is also less of a threat now.
 
Another Rule Broken
 And during the gulf war, the dollar fell to record lows against the German mark and gold did not rise, breaking another rule of thumb: that gold should strengthen as confidence in the dollar weakens.
One of gold's other major problems is that it is much misunderstood by those who invest in it and, therefore, investors are frequently disappointed. Gold is more likely to be a winner when all other investments are losers.
"In the West, they seem to have this perception that gold is a quick-buck metal and a quick-buck investment, and I do not think that is what gold is all about," said James P. Hildebrandt, vice president for investment of the World Gold Council, an association of 82 gold-producing companies from 14 countries whose goal is to promote world demand.
In the United States, the fall in interest in gold is dramatically reflected in the sales of gold Eagle coins. First minted at the end of 1986, sales of these coins have plummeted by nearly 75 percent, to 457,450 ounces in 1990, from 1.8 million ounces in 1986. Despite a surge in January, when the bombing started in the Persian Gulf, 1991 sales of 171,500 ounces are lagging slightly behind the 1990 pace.
The production of other gold coins, including the Canadian Maple Leaf, has also fallen. Overall coin production and sales were down in 1990 by more than 10 percent. South Africa is planning to market its gold Krugerrands abroad again after the lifting of sanctions in Europe, but slack demand and more competitors will make it difficult for the Krugerrand to become the market leader again.
There are still those gold bulls who see another rally coming. They argue that current data show that the robust production of gold will begin to decline in the mid-1990's, giving prices a reason to advance.
Still, these analysts are not talking of another rush to $800 an ounce. "I don't think so," said Stewart Murray, chief executive of Gold Fields Mineral Services. "We are talking about a moderate increase," he said, and probably a brief one, too. He added that if prices reached $500 or $600 an ounce, production would pick up quickly again, capping the rally.
Gold bulls pin their forecasts on a major crisis that would restore investor faith in gold's durability when all else seemed worthless, something the Persian Gulf crisis apparently did not do. So gold's boosters are counting on something more dramatic, like disruptions in the world financial markets, including bank collapses, or a return to gold as a backer of major currencies. The United States abandoned the gold standard in 1971 as it moved to a free-floating foreign exchange rate.
But even the bulls are a little wary of talking about gold's future, seemingly numbed by the years of the metal's dull performance. Alan Posnick, senior vice president at the MTB Banking Corporation, a major New York-based dealer in gold coins, said: "$800 an ounce? I think you will see it again. But don't ask me when."

HEADLINE: Vacations, Yes, but Closer to Home This Summer

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL

 BODY:
The third week in June brings not only the summer solstice but also the start of the year's heaviest vacation season. In 10 hectic weeks through Labor Day, millions of Americans spend billions of dollars on air fares, gasoline, hotels and restaurants.
But this year, despite some of the most favorable airline and hotel discounts in years, people in the travel industry say the summer season is not likely to be anything to write home about. Even at this late date, some analysts say they still do not know whether the peak travel season will be disastrous or just disappointing. 
 Representatives of the lodging industry have made public statistics for only the first four months of this year. But Mark Lomanno, the research manager for Smith Travel Research, which follows the $61 billion lodging industry, said, "I'd be real surprised if there's a tremendous turnabout."
Still battered by the effects of a weak economy, many vacationers will be pinching pennies and cutting corners as perhaps never before -- or not since the 1960's and early 70's, at any rate, when traveling on a shoestring was a rite of passage for many.
"People our age for years have sort of done what we wanted to do," said Molly Peterson, a 42-year-old resident of Atlanta, who is staying home this year, along with her husband and three children. "We just figured it would get better and better. But now we are finding that is not the case. When I think about what we used to do -- taking trips every summer, going skiing every March, camp for the children, private schools, a lake house -- we must have been insane, in a dream world. We are no longer in the dream world."
Many Americans will scale back on vacations this year. "Trips will be of shorter duration, people will be traveling mostly by car and they'll be staying closer to home, often with friends and relatives," said Scott Dring, a spokesman for the United States Travel Data Center, a not-for-profit research organiztion in Washington that is financed by the travel industry.
That pattern could well describe Julia Reynolds, a Houston accountant; her husband, Billy, who works as an operator at a chemical plant, and their 2-year-old son. Their summer vacation will consist of driving to Mrs. Reynolds's mother's home in Monroe, La., for four days. As for more ambitious vacation plans, "we decided we can't afford it this year," she said.
 
War and Recession's Effect
 Stephen G. Beuret, a Philadelphia engineer, recently returned from a week of visiting friends in Portland, Ore. "I went because I had somebody there I could stay with," he said. "If I had had to stay in a hotel, I probably would not have gone."
No wonder the most optimistic assessment the American Hotel and Motel Association can manage is that bookings might be up slightly over last year.
"The lodging industry took a double hit early this year, with war and recession," said Michele Kelly, the association's director of communications, "and we need to fill rooms."
Industry officials said many people decided to stay home during the Persian Gulf war because of their interest in following the war on television, the increase in gasoline prices and a general uncertainty over the war's effect.
The promotions and discounts, up to 60 percent in some hotel chains, are likely to help the vacation industry. But Mr. Lamanno said the overall outlook was not promising. The industry already took in $500 million less than expected in the first quarter of this year.
 
Outlook on Air Travel
 No turnabout appears likely soon for some other travel-related industries. Domestic air passenger traffic fell 3.8 percent in the first four months of this year, the latest period for which industry statistics have been made public, compared to the same period in 1990.
And "advance bookings for domestic travel this summer haven't looked too good," said William E. Jackman, a vice president of the Air Transport Association, an industry trade group in Washington. The industry, which had passenger revenues of $58.4 billion last year, had been hoping for a strong summer to help it recover from last year's $4 billion loss, the worst in airline history.
The Travel Data Center predicts that vacation travel by automobile will increase to 84 percent of all 1991 vacation travel in June, July and August, up from 82 percent last summer. It also predicts that air travel will fall to 13 percent this year, from 14 percent in 1990 and 15 percent in 1989 and 1988.
 
Spending Less On Travel
 The data center is projecting 326 million vacation person-trips this summer, about the same as last year. (It defines a person-trip as one person traveling at least 100 miles from home.) But there is less to those figures than meets the eye.
'Most travelers are going to spend about the same or slightly less than last year," said Ida Simmons, director of communications for D. K. Shifflet & Associates, a travel research firm. Taking into account inflation, this means the industry is likely to lose substantial ground, in constant dollars.
While deep discounts and aggressive promotions are pumping life back into the international air travel market, from which the bottom all but dropped out during the gulf war, the Americans who travel to Europe this summer are not likely to be the free spenders of yore.
"It looks like a strong summer, as far as numbers are concerned," said Michel Bouquier, chairman of the European Travel Commission, which represents in this country the national tourist offices of 24 European countries. "But Americans are not staying as long as they used to and not spending as much as they used to."
 
Looking at Special Deals
 They are also setting records for the short interval between the time they inquire about traveling to Europe and their date of departure. "That probably suggests that the special deals and advertising are having an effect, and people feel they have to catch that opportunity," Mr. Bouquier said.
But tightened budgets do not allow some people to cash in on such opportuities. "I wish I could tell you I was going to Hawaii," said Julie Aitken, a public affairs specialist with the Army Corps of Engineers in New Orleans. "Even though I could take a week off, I wouldn't have any money to go anywhere."
 
Patriotic Symbols Suffer
 In the aftermath of the war, many people predicted record numbers of visitors at attractions like the Liberty Bell, Valley Forge in Pennsylvania and similar patriotic symbols. But while official figures from the National Park Service are available only through April, and show mixed results, it is beginning to look as if the turnouts at such sites will fall short of expecations.
John D. Hunt, the head of the recreation and tourism department at the University of Idaho, said the slowdown in travel this summer recalled the early 1980's, when recession also battered the economy.
"The big difference," Professor Hunt said, "is that now the financial difficulties of the airlines and hotel chains are likely to force even more mergers than have occurred because of deregulation of the airlines and overbuilding of hotels in the 1980's, especially in urban areas." If that happens, he added, air fares and room rates will almost certainly rise.
Some of the vacation patterns that are especially noticeable this year have been under way for several years. July, for example, has gradually overtaken August as the most popular month for vacations.
Amtrak has enjoyed strong summer seasons for four or five years, said R. Clifford Black 4th, the manager of public affairs; its trains are heavily booked again this year. And since 1988, the growth rate of travel by automobile has exceeded the growth rate of travel by plane.
 
More 3-Day Trips
 Even the trend toward shorter vacations has been evident for a few years, although that change is said to be less a matter of economics than of the increase in households with two incomes, because it is harder to schedule simultaneous vacations.
But not all areas of the country are expected to lose out this summer. "The southeastern part of the country is seeing a pretty good summer," said Mr. Dring of the Travel Data Center. But he said the Northeast is still feeling the effects of the economic downturn.
Brokers in the Hamptons, Cape Cod, the Catskills and the New Jersey Shore said this spring that demand for summer houses was off, prices were down as much as 20 percent and more second homes were being offered for rent.
"But the big thing now," Mr. Dring said, "is that trips of one to three nights will account for about 51 percent of all vacation trips this year, higher than the 48 percent last year and higher than it ever has been."
That statistic is especially meaningful this summer, when the Fourth of July falls on a Thursday. "I wonder if people will also take off the previous Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, and count it as one of their vacations," said Ms. Simmons of D. K. Shifflet. If so, it will hurt the travel industry, she said, "because as people take shorter trips everybody's going to lose the travel dollar."
But while the travel industry can expect instability over the next few years, Professor Hunt said, the long-term outlook is favorable for the industry and travelers alike.
"A lot of my colleagues talk about the business side of travel," he said. "But people don't travel because travel businesses exist. They travel for pleasure and knowledge and relaxation and all kinds of other reasons, and nothing in the foreseeable future seems likely to change that."

HEADLINE: Health Chief Warns A.M.A. on Cost of Medicine

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: CHICAGO, June 23

 BODY:
The Secretary of Health and Human Services, Louis W. Sullivan, appealed to the nation's largest organization of doctors today to curb soaring medical costs and improve availability of care or risk a virtual popular revolt.
"Unless we act now to meet these goals, we could find ourselves with a critical mass of our citizens demanding a total government takeover of health care," Dr. Sullivan told hundreds of doctors at the opening of the American Medical Association's annual meeting. 
 "I doubt that many in this room today would welcome that development," he said.
The Secretary has been an ally of the doctors' group on issues like trying to keep tobacco out of the hands of minors but, unlike the organization, supports a proposed restructuring of Medicare fees that would reduce payments to doctors for many procedures.
 
Health Care 12% of G.N.P.
 Dr. Sullivan said health care accounted for about 12 percent of the gross national product in 1990 -- or about $2,500 for every citizen.
"As physicians, we must recognize that health care is not the only public good," he said. "As Americans, as well as physicians, we must be concerned that consuming ever larger portions of G.N.P. on health care necessarily diverts resources from other good uses -- for example, increased wages, savings, capital investment, research and development and human services such as drug rehabilitation, foster care and family support."
Dr. Sullivan made only a passing reference to the AIDS epidemic, which is expected to be the dominant topic at the gathering, when he issued a call for increased emphasis on people's accepting responsibility for their own health.
Included, he said, would be improved diet, childhood vaccinations, early prenatal care, elimination of illegal drugs and tobacco and curtailment of sexual practices that can spread AIDS.
 
AIDS and Health-Care Workers
 Among AIDS-related issues expected to be considered by the 300,000-member association's policy-making house of delegates is the question of restricting health-care workers who are infected with the AIDS virus.
The delegates are also expected to discuss whether doctors should undergo regular AIDS testing.
The outgoing president of the association, John C. Tupper, said AIDS "certainly will be the overriding public health issue" considered by the 438 delegates at the five-day gathering.
Tobacco will be another major topic, said a spokeswoman for the association, Pat Clark. One resolution urges the association to encourage major league baseball teams to ban smoking in their stadiums, and commends the Oakland Athletics for doing so.
 
Award for Captain Kangaroo
 Delegates will also review genetic testing, which Dr. Tupper said had the potential for misuse as the technology develops. He said insurance companies could use the testing to screen out prospective policyholders who carry genes for certain diseases.
Also today, the association gave its layman's distinguished service award to Bob Keeshan, who plays Captain Kangaroo on television and who has been an advocate for children.
"In this lovely land, we have made children our principal underclass," said Mr. Keeshan, 63 years old. He urged doctors to take the lead in fighting hunger, malnutrition, measles, whooping cough and polio, which are increasing among some groups of American youngsters.
"Kids can't vote in this country," Mr. Keeshan continued. "Kuwaitis can't vote either. But that did not stop us from coming to the aid of the Kuwaitis in their hour of great peril. If we can help the Kuwaitis, we ought to be able to help our kids."

HEADLINE: 1964 Chain-Gang Escape Follows Man North to L.I.

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRENTWOOD, L.I., June 21

 BODY:
James Harris was 17 years old and a high school truant when he ran into trouble with the law in Alabama in 1962. Beaten, he says, into confessing to a burglary, he was sentenced to 21 years in prison and sent to a chain gang to dig ditches and lay asphalt on Alabama's muddy back roads.
In 1964, with $20 and a pair of shoes from his fellow prisoners, Mr. Harris escaped to Long Island and began to make a life for himself. It has hardly been free of trouble -- there was a robbery in 1974 and a $25 drug bust a year ago -- but along the way, he married twice, had three children, and worked as a welder in his uncle's company. 
 Now, after 27 years, Alabama wants him back -- again.
What makes this case extraordinary, besides the length of time that has elapsed, is that 21 years ago Alabama tried, and failed, to extradite Mr. Harris from New York.
At that time, Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller, expressing concern about the fairness of the sentence and saying that justice would not be served by sending Mr. Harris back, refused to sign the extradition papers.
Last summer, the Commissioner of Alabama's Department of Corrections, Morris L. Thigpen, signed an order that Mr. Harris be returned to finish his sentence. And, following custom, New York's Governor, Mario M. Cuomo, signed a fugitive warrant, clearing the way for Mr. Harris's return. A judge has temporarily stayed that order, pending a hearing in the case, so Mr. Harris remains here, at least for now.
No one, not even the officials in Alabama seeking his return, argues that Mr. Harris is a hardened criminal. He is described by his lawyer and by his family here, where he lives with his mother, as someone who fell into bad times but never had a bad man's heart. To John Ray, Mr. Harris's lawyer, his client is a modern-day Jean Valjean, the hapless hero who was pursued for years for stealing a loaf of bread in Victor Hugo's "Les Miserables."
 
Too Harsh a Sentence, Lawyer Says
 "There's no way he should have to spend another 20 years of his life in jail for something he did when he was 17," said Mr. Ray. The lawyer argues that Mr. Harris, who is black, was given too harsh a sentence at a time when the South's system of justice was notoriously racist.
His uncle, Cleve Jones, who employed Mr. Harris in his home-improvement business when the economy was better, said: "He's not a mean-spirited guy, you know, trying to hurt people or anything like that. He got into some trouble, just hanging out, I guess. But he's a nice guy."
State Supreme Court Justice Kenneth J. Rohl, who is to hear Mr. Ray's case against Mr. Harris's extradition on July 1, said in an interview that he felt there was a strong case against sending Mr. Harris back to Alabama. By coincidence, Justice Rohl represented Mr. Harris's co-defendant in the 1974 robbery case and so remembered the earlier extradition debate.
He said that Mr. Harris's record in New York had no bearing on whether he should have to finish out a harsh, decades-old sentence in Alabama. "He's paid the price here," Justice Rohl said. "If he's screwed up and been convicted and sentenced, that's an entirely different matter than what he did in Alabama."
Mr. Harris, a soft-spoken man, said he was sure the extradition matter was put to rest years ago. Pulling yellowed-newspaper clippings out of a frayed folder, Mr. Harris said he could not fathom why Alabama would suddenly want him back.
"Since 1964, they have known where I was -- I wasn't hiding from them," he said. "I thought this case was over. Why do they keep bringing it up again?"
Mr. Harris does not pretend he has been a model citizen. "Sure, I made mistakes," he said. "But I paid for them."
Mr. Harris's recent troubles began a year ago, when he was arrested in Suffolk County and charged with helping a drug dealer sell $25 worth of cocaine to undercover police officers. At his bail hearing, by chance in front of Justice Rohl, the assistant district attorney said that a computer check of Mr. Harris's record showed that he was a fugitive in Alabama.
"That was dealt with and completely taken care of," said Justice Rohl, according to a transcript of the hearing. "Those in power who had authority over that matter never pursued it."
Mr. Harris pleaded guilty and went to Attica to begin serving his one-to-three-year sentence.
Meanwhile, New York notified Alabama that Mr. Harris had resurfaced, and Alabama issued a fugitive warrant. "We're required to continue as long as there's any possibility of getting a person back to serve whatever time is owed this state on a sentence," said John Hale, a spokesman for Alabama's Corrections Department.
 
'Governor's Obligation'
 Then, Governor Cuomo signed an order directing New York State officials to turn Mr. Harris over to Alabama after his prison term was over. Thomas Conroy, a spokesman for the Governor, said Mr. Cuomo had little choice. "It is the Governor's obligation to obey the law, and the law is that the Governor must honor the request for extradition," he said.
Legal experts say that is rare for one governor not to honor another's extradition request, but that it can be done. "In cases involving unfair sentences and unfair prosecution from a long time ago, governors can use their discretion in favor of mercy," said Leon Friedman, a professor of criminal procedure at Hofstra University Law School. "If Rockefeller applied it at one time and gave him mercy, why can't Cuomo apply it now?"
Neither state seems to think that what happened in 1970 has much resonance today, and both states said they have destroyed all records of the extradition request and denial.
Justice Rohl has stayed Governor Cuomo's order until the case can be heard. Mr. Ray said he plans to argue that the extradition question was decided long ago. "The state of New York exonerated him; the court at the time exonerated him, so he's not a fugitive," he said. "And once Alabama knew he was in New York and did nothing to arrest him, he was no longer a fugitive."
Until the case is heard, Mr. Harris remains in limbo. Recently released from his drug sentence, he is back in Brentwood, wondering what will become of him.
"After 27 years, I know those people in Alabama don't want to just talk to me," he said. "I went through this 20 years ago, and now I have to go through it again. I don't know too much about the law, but I don't know how they could do this to a person."

HEADLINE: RICH NATIONS BACK JUNIOR SOVIET ROLE IN MONETARY FUND

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, June 23

 BODY:
The seven leading industrial democracies agreed in principle here today that the Soviet Union should be offered a limited role in the International Monetary Fund, the American Treasury Secretary, Nicholas F. Brady, said.
He said the offer would probably be made when President Mikhail S. Gorbachev meets with leaders of the seven nations here next month. 
 By acquiring what is being called associate membership in the fund -- and presumably in the fund's sister organization, the World Bank -- the Soviet Union would gain technical assistance toward economic reform but no immediate I.M.F. bailout to revive its moribund economy.
 
Milestone for Soviets
 Still, the move would represent a milestone in Moscow's efforts to join the world financial system. The idea was first proposed by President Bush in December.
Mr. Brady and finance ministers from the other six countries who met here today along with central bankers indicated that they remained divided on the issue of whether Mr. Gorbachev should be offered large-scale financial aid at the end of the July summit meeting.
Of the seven nations, the United States, Japan and Britain are the most opposed to promising the Soviet Union a large amount of financial aid until it is clear that Moscow is firmly on the road to a free-market democracy.
Germany has been much more sympathetic to the idea of promising large amounts of aid. And France today indicated that it was not taking a rigid position. The other countries represented were Italy and Canada.
 
What the I.M.F. Does
 The I.M.F.'s role is to help countries draw up and implement large-scale plans aimed at reforming their economies, often providing them with financial assistance along the way to help them cope with the painful process. For example, the fund could be involved in helping the Soviet Union devise plans to make the ruble convertible into Western currencies as well as strategies to lift price controls, slash subsidies and rein in its rapidly growing money supply.
The World Bank is typically involved in more narrowly focused programs to help countries develop their infrastructure and private sectors. It could be involved in helping Moscow turn the state-owned Soviet oil industry into an investor-owned entity, for example, or in setting up a modern banking and financial system.
Roughly 150 nations belong to the monetary fund and contribute to it under a formula based on their economic power. The United States provides about a fifth of the financing for the monetary fund and the World Bank. Membership in the I.M.F is required for participation in the World Bank.
 
British Appear Guarded
 At a news conference, Mr. Brady said the participants in today's meeting had reached "a general agreement that the idea of associate status" for the Soviet Union in the I.M.F. "was a good one."
Norman Lamont, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, was more guarded when asked about whether the Soviets would be offered associate membership when Mr. Gorbachev meets with leaders of the seven countries on July 17, after their economic summit meeting. He indicated that the Europeans supported the idea, which suggested that perhaps the Japanese had the most reservations.
Analysts said that while associate membership would give Moscow only a limited role, it could serve as an important catalyst for investment and financial aid from other nations. This is because the monetary fund and the World Bank could inspire confidence in the Soviet economy by giving their approval to economic reform programs and individual investment projects.
 
Soviets Declined in 1944
 The I.M.F. and the World Bank were established at a conference at Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, in 1944 as part of the effort to insure stability after World War II. But the Soviet Union declined repeated invitations by Western nations, including the United States, to join the organizations. At the time, Moscow was believed to have a stable currency and did not want to submit to regulations that would require it to disclose the amount of its gold reserves and other economic data.
At his news conference, Mr. Brady said he detected no resistance to the associate membership idea, but he added that no vote had been taken on whether the offer would definitely be made.
Mr. Brady also noted that the countries had still not defined the rights of associate membership. "I assume more work will be done between now and the summit to flesh out exactly what that means," he said.
President Bush suggested the notion of associate membership for the Soviets in December, but the proposal was presumably put on ice following Moscow's crackdown in the independence-minded Baltic republics.
Moscow has been interested in applying for full I.M.F. membership for about two years, analysts said. But gaining full membership is a complicated process and would take six months and possibly much longer, analysts said. The associate membership would be a way for the Soviets to get I.M.F. advice immediately.
David S. Roche, a London-based economist at Morgan Stanley & Company, said some Western governments might be hestitant about offering the associate membership at a time when Mr. Gorbachev's commitment to economic reform remains unclear.
Last week, Mr. Gorbachev said he thought he could combine a bold plan drawn up by a group of Harvard economists and Grigory A. Yavlinksy, a Soviet economist, that would transform the Soviet economy over five years with the help of $100 billion in Western aid and a plan by Soviet Prime Minister Valentin S. Pavlov, which calls for the country's command economy to evolve gradually towards a free market.
"He says he can meld the two approaches and he can't," Mr. Roche said. Noting that associate I.M.F. membership is tantamount to the Soviets agreeing to use an I.M.F.-approved plan to reform their economy, Mr. Roche said the I.M.F. affiliation would not make sense if Mr. Gorbachev backed that kind of compromise plan.
 
U.S. Position Unchanged
 Some analysts noted that the Japanese might be reluctant to offer Moscow greater aid or a greater role in the Western financial system in light of the lack of progress in their efforts to get the Soviets to relinquish islands in the northern part of the Japanese archipelago that the Soviet Union seized at the end of World War II. The Japanese are also among those most skeptical of Moscow's pledges of economic reform.
The United States recently agreed to provide the Soviets with $1.5 billion in credits to buy American farm goods, which some analysts interpreted as a softening of the Bush Administration's opposition to promising large-scale upfront aid to the Soviets at the July meeting. But Mr. Brady stressed today that the Administration's position had not changed and maintained that there was general agreement on this at today's gathering. "Large sums of money are not what we're talking about here," he said.
At their news conferences, however, German and French officials were unwilling to take such a hardline position. Theo Waigel, the German Finance Minister, said he could not anticipate what would happen at the July summit and that a lot depended on what Mr. Gorbachev told the leaders about his plans for political and economic reform.
 
The Trouble With the Dollar
 The other major subject of today's meeting of finance ministers and central bankers was what to do about the surging dollar. The officials indicated that they could live with the dollar at its current level. But they pledged to intervene in the financial markets by buying or selling currencies if the dollar continued to soar too rapidly, upsetting the world economy.
Another thing that the officials could not agree on today was a coordinated interest policy. As a result, economists doubted that central-bank intervention in the markets alone would be able to contain the dollar's rise for more than a couple months.
Since early February, the dollar's value has climbed about 14 percent against a trade-weighted basket of currencies, nearly 25 percent against the German mark and nearly 9 percent against the Japanese yen.
 
No Soviet Response
MOSCOW, June 23 (Special to The New York Times) -- While there was no official comment on the I.M.F. decision here today, President Gorbachev would probably prefer full membership in the organization, and will probably greet associate membership as a step toward full membership.
His greater immediate problem is that the search for Western aid has become a political issue with the right-wing, which has always viewed the I.M.F. as a capitalist tool for world domination. In the pre-Gorbachev days, in fact, the I.M.F. and World Bank were among the leading targets of Soviet propaganda.
The "associate membership" might give the conservatives a weapon both to revive the old foe and to claim that Mr. Gorbachev cannot even get proper aid out of the I.M.F.
The conservatives, who have been feeling themselves on the defensive again, lashed out at Mr. Gorbachev in Parliament last week, ranging behind a short-lived proposal by Mr. Pavlov to acquire greater powers. During the debate, some conservatives seized on the Western aid as a weapon against Mr. Gorbachev, accusing him of letting the West call the shots in Moscow and of preparing to go to London with a begging bowl.
The leaked transcript of a closed-session speech by K.G.B. Chief Vladimir A. Kryuchkov last week revived old charges of a C.I.A. plot to subvert the Soviet economy. Mr. Kryuchkov did not link this to the Yavlinsky-Harvard plan to push the Soviet Union toward a market economy by providing billions of dollars of aid, but in the context he seemed intent on smearing any aid from the West.
The pressure from the right has led Mr. Gorbachev to soft-pedal the Yavlinsky-Harvard plan, saying he will merge it with the Government's "anti-crisis program" and other economic plans.
At the same time, Mr. Gorbachev and liberal advisers like Mr. Yavlinsky are likely to portray the I.M.F. associate membership as evidence that their initiative is bearing fruit, even if they privately feel disappointed.

Industry Coalition Opposes Ad Tax Plan

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
A group of advertising and media trade associations has announced its opposition to a proposal to assess a quarter of 1 percent Federal tax on ad revenues.
The group, the Advertising Tax Coalition, sent a letter Friday to members of Congress, arguing that the tax "could seriously disrupt the economy" and would be a serious blow to newspapers, magazines and broadcasters already suffering in the recession. 
 At a hearing earlier this month of a House of Representatives committee, the tax was suggested as a possible source of public funds for campaign expenses of candidates for Federal offices.
The letter was signed by 10 coalition members, including John E. O'Toole, president and chief executive of the American Association of Advertising Agencies; Cathleen Black, president and chief executive of the American Newspaper Publishers Association, and Edward O. Fritts, president and chief executive of the National Association of Broadcasters.

HEADLINE: At Home Abroad;
Margaret Thatcher's Britain

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
In the last week Margaret Thatcher has been feted in the United States. She spoke to weighty audiences in New York and Chicago, and she met President Bush. Americans, it seems, still regard her with a respect bordering on awe.
How different it is in her own country -- and her own Conservative Party. There is still a small group of loyal Thatcherites. But apart from them, the general opinion is that Mrs. Thatcher is an arrogant pest, a political has-been who ought to stop making life difficult for her successor, John Major. 
 Irritation with the former Prime Minister was brought to a boil by her American speeches. Just when Mr. Major was trying to avoid controversy about Britain's place in the European Community, Mrs. Thatcher denounced plans for a European monetary union. She even attacked the decision to bring the pound into the European exchange-rate system, which her own Government made before she was forced out last November.
Polls taken after her speeches found that a majority of the public, and of Conservative back benchers in the House of Commons, thought she should give up her seat in the House at the next general election, which will probably come a year from now.
Those feelings must seem surprising, given Mrs. Thatcher's domination of British politics for so long. She was Prime Minister for 11 years, and the Thatcher Revolution was the talk of conservatives on both sides of the Atlantic.
One reason for the disaffection is that her policies -- the boosting of free-market economics and the downgrading of public service -- had not brought results as happy as advertised.
Her one undoubted achievement was the curbing of the trade unions. That looks permanent. Hardly anyone, least of all the opposition Labor Party, wants to go back to the situation of a few union leaders having the power to bring the economy to its knees.
But the great promise of Thatcherism was that Britain would become a more thrusting, economically enterprising country when freed of government ownership and controls. That has not happened.
The country is in a severe recession now. Manufacturing output has fallen 6.5 percent in the last year. There is nearly 8 percent unemployment, a high figure for Britain.
A particular promise of Thatcher economics was that hard times, if they came, would produce leaner, more efficient industry. But in the most recent three-month period productivity declined by 2.4 percent, and unit labor costs in industry rose by more than 11 percent.
Public resentment of hard times is made more acute by the fact that a handful of the rich are growing richer. A special provocation has been huge pay increases for the chief executives of utilities that the Thatcher Government sold off to private ownership.
The chairman of British Telecom, for example, got a 43 percent increase, to the equivalent of $865,000 a year. The chairman of British Gas went up 66 percent, to $600,000.
There is also deep unhappiness about what happened during the Thatcher years to the National Health Service. It remains a high-quality, universal medical system, but it is under severe strain. There are long waits -- as long as a year for elective surgery such as hip replacements.
The reason is mainly lack of money. Sir Raymond Hoffenberg, immediate past president of the Royal College of Physicians, said: "By international standards, in recent years the Health Service has been grossly underfunded."
But more than economics is involved in the public disaffection with Mrs. Thatcher. Her bossy manner became more and more grating in her later years in office. She took to using the royal we in speech, and she acted as if disagreement with her was lese-majeste. Many Britons felt relief when she quit, and they do not want her back in their lives.
The mood was indicated in a Persian Gulf war military parade last week. The news story in The Times of London, which used to be zealously pro-Thatcher, began:
"When British troops last paraded in victory through the City of London, after the Falklands conflict, Mrs. Thatcher took the salute. Yesterday the real Queen was in her rightful place . . ."

HEADLINE: Essay;
To Protect the Kurds

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
In diplomatic secrecy, the Bush Administration is negotiating a deal with its coalition allies to pull the last protective troops out of Iraqi Kurdistan.
Our policy is driven by the politics of extrication: how to get out of Iraq quietly, replacing a force of coalition troops with more than a company of U.N. eunuchs. The plan is to prevent Iraq's underdefeated dictator from merely waiting a decent interval before he breaks his promises of peaceful autonomy and resumes his genocide against the Kurdish people. 
 Here is the preliminary deal being discussed:
First, we await the outcome of talks that took place in Baghdad between Kurdish leaders and Saddam Hussein. The dictator has promised autonomy in Kurdistan, elections throughout the country, the separation of the Baath Party from the Government -- all items he can easily rescind later. He has held back the inclusion of the oil city of Kirkuk in Kurdistan because that might interfere with cash coming in soon.
Next, we await the talks among the Kurds. All Kurds may be victims, but not all Kurds are angels; to a hostile or indifferent world they present a united front, but in the back are as faction-ridden as any nation.
Massoud Barzani, son of Mulla Mustafa, is the authentic leader who has long fought his people's battle in the hills. He must deal with Jalal Talabani, a smooth talker who has spent most of his time outside Kurdistan; and with independent-minded guerrilla leaders on the scene; as well as with longtime Kurdish collaborators with Saddam who swung over to the Kurds' cause when he seemed about to fall, and who precipitated the high-casualty war in the cities.
As the enterprising Patrick Tyler of The New York Times reports from Kurdistan, Mr. Barzani is now selling the imperfect agreement made in Baghdad -- which includes his promise to help Saddam get sanctions eased -- to his colleagues. Arab members of the anti-Saddam coalition tell me he has a shrewd strategy: obtain from Saddam whatever democracy and autonomy he is now ready to falsely offer, and then get the rest of the world to guarantee that those phony promises are kept.
When the Kurds agree with Mr. Barzani to make that gamble, the Americans and other coalition members would take that as a signal to withdraw.
To show that the extrication is not abandonment, a division or two of allied ground troops, including Americans, would remain nearby in Turkey; the U.N. relief observers inside Iraqi Kurdistan would be increased to 500; more significant militarily, coalition air and naval forces would be based in Egypt, the gulf emirates, Saudi Arabia, as well as Turkey. (Syria won't play; Israel won't be asked.)
One purpose of this international force, to be announced later this summer, would be to make certain that no genocidal attacks are launched against Kurds or Shiites.
With this military assurance, on top of a threatened calibration of economic sanctions, the coalition would tiptoe out of the line of fire between a recovering Saddam Hussein and Kurds who always resist subjugation.
Sound good? Sure. Would it work? Only if an unmistakable message accompanied the pullout: that allied air power would enforce the reforms extracted by the Kurds from Baghdad.
Many Kurds suspect their nemesis plans to exploit a withdrawal with a type of warfare he has conducted before: kidnapping or assassinating Kurdish leaders, as he did the brothers of Massoud Barzani. If withdrawal is inexorable, here's how to help prevent that: President Bush should invite Mr. Barzani to visit him in the White House, thereby providing the personal protection and support that Ronald Reagan gave Angola's Jonas Savimbi.
He should assure the Kurdish patriot that the coalition will make Iraqi Kurdistan a gunship-free zone; that relief will be channeled through Turkey to the autonomous Kurdish subgovernment in the regional capital; and that the U.S. will welcome 5,000 Kurdish refugees a year to underscore our concern.
This month, after two decades, Henry Kissinger manfully asserted that the great error America made toward the Kurds in the 70's was in not telling them at the start of their uprising how far we were prepared to back them up. We made that tragic mistake, so costly in lives, again this year. Twice is enough.

DATELINE: SYDNEY, Australia, June 24

 BODY:
Australia was the third-largest recipient of Japanese investment, after the United States and Britain, in the last year, with Australia's auto industry attracting most of the cash, according to figures released last week. The Australia-Japan Economic Institute said Japanese investors put $3.67 billion into Australia, a 14 percent drop from $4.26 billion in the previous year, when investment was unusually high because of a boom in real estate and financial services.

HEADLINE: Exporters Fight Costs and Rules of Brazil's Ports

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SANTOS, Brazil

 BODY:
The number of containers handled here, at Latin America's largest port, tripled in the 1980's as the volume of loose cargo declined. But the port's operations still seem like a parody of modernization. Union work rules and Government regulations require each stevedore gang moving a steel container to include someone schooled in the ancient art of sewing torn coffee sacks.
A forest of archaic regulations, labor cartels and state control has grown so thick around Brazilian ports that the nation's manufacturers think the growth in the 1990's of Latin America's largest economy depends on a more efficient port. 
 "We are afraid that if the port obstacles continue, our exporters will not be able to compete with the Asian 'tigers,' " said Elmar Jose Braun, president of the local association of shipping agents, referring to the fast-growing economies of eastern Asia.
 
Billions May Be Lost
 Over all, Brazil stands to lose $5 billion in potential exports this year because of high port charges, estimated Marcus Vinicius Pratini de Moraes, president of the Association of Brazilian Exporters.
The bag repairer is part of a larger system that renders Brazilian ports among the slowest and most expensive in the world. To load a container on a ship here requires a labor crew of 31 and costs $525. To unload the same container in Rotterdam, one of the world's most automated ports, requires a crew of 10 and costs $130.
The Dutch workers move an average of 28 containers an hour, twice as many as here -- an important consideration when it can cost $25,000 a day to run an oceangoing cargo ship. And unlike American and European ports, most Brazilian ports do not work through the night.
"Many Latin American and Caribbean ports function as if they were still in the first half of this century and seem indifferent to the global economy where they have to compete," the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean said in March in a 150-page study of the region's ports.
The rates for handling one ton of steel in 1988, the report said, were $22 in Santos, compared with $5.60 in Jacksonville, Fla.; $3.80 in Rotterdam, and $3.18 in Kaohiung, Taiwan.
 
'I Feel Robbed'
 "As a steel producer, I feel robbed by the Brazilian port system," Jorge Gerdau Johanpeter, vice president of the Association of Private Steel Mills, recently said in testimony before Brazilian lawmakers. Mr. Gerdau estimated that this year Brazil will forgo $600 million in potential overseas steel sales because of uncompetitive port charges.
In another sign of the labor unrest that plagues Brazil's exporters, workers closed the five ports of Rio de Janeiro state for a two-week strike that ended on Thursday. By the end of the strike, a state steel company was losing $2.5 million a day because of delayed exports or lost orders.
"The Brazilians are just choking off what could be an avenue to free trade," an American broker of shipping space said in an interview.
The business community's congressional testimony favored a Government-sponsored bill that would privatize many port functions and break up union monopolies. But as with efforts by President Fernando Collor de Mello to reform the economy, business people fear that special interests will gut the port bill. Already, it carries 119 amendments.
Luiz Augusto Vieira Braga, the powerful first secretary of the Santos Stevedores Union, said his workers were, in fact, poorly paid.
"Our longshoremen brothers from around the world tell us it is always the same song: 'Rotterdam is more efficient. Rotterdam is more efficient,' " Mr. Braga said at his headquarters. He paused to take calls from an aide to Sao Paulo state's governor and from a powerful state senator.
"Operating costs in Santos are among the lowest in the world," he continued. "Our men earn $300 a month loading containers that American stevedores unload for $5,000 a month."
Business critics say the ports' high costs stem not from wage levels but from a constellation of other problems -- state mismanagement, a lack of investment for improvements, and regulations that penalize private terminal operators and require overstaffing.
In Santos, with 189 cranes and seven miles of docks capable of handling 65 oceangoing ships at a time, the state port authority saw 95 percent of revenues go to cover personnel costs in 1989.
This proportion has since dropped to 70 percent, but the port is still grossly overstaffed. With about 20,000 workers, the port one day in late May was serving only nine ships.
"In Rotterdam, 2,000 people handle 290 million tons a year," said Mr. Braun of the shipping agents' association. "Rotterdam moves 10 times the cargo with 10 times less people."
Although the payroll is being trimmed through attrition, layoff attempts in October and February set off two general strikes, lasting three weeks each. The strikes intensified the exodus of traffic to Brazil's second- and third-largest container ports, Rio de Janeiro and Paranagua.
Private shipping terminals have had more success than state-owned terminals in reducing labor costs. About 80 percent of the 30 million tons of cargo handled annually by Santos moves through private terminals.
But under Brazilian law, a company that owns a private terminal can handle only its own cargo. Other shippers have to use state terminals, and Brazil, virtually bankrupt, has no money for improvements.
"We want to allow more construction of private terminals and to allow private terminals to handle all cargo," said Renato Voltaire Araujo, a member of Integrated Business Action, an association of port users that supports the deregulation bill.
To influence legislators in Brasilia, the association this month published a bound volume of 70 editorials from O Globo, Rio's largest and most influential newspaper. Published over the last two years, all of the editorials bemoan the backward state of the ports.
 
Freedom to Choose Workers
 Shippers also want to win the freedom to choose workers and determine the size of work gangs. Under labor legislation dating to 1934, shipping agents are assigned port workers from a pool. With 12 unions enforcing strict labor categories, work gangs are unecessarily large, shippers say.
"We have absolutely no control over who works for us," said David G. Lorimer, president of the National Center for Transatlantic Navigation, an industry group. "There is no responsibility if a stevedore makes a mistake and swings a container into the side of a ship, or if he drops it," said Mr. Lorimer, who manages a shipping agency here. Sometimes to insure that a crane is operated properly, a shipper will pay a union-supplied worker to stand by idly while a professional from the company performs the job.
In a labor aristocracy, workers carrying union cards routinely sell their assignments to nonunion workers. As a result, the same man often is listed as working on three vessels at the same time.
Mr. Braga says the stevedores in his union are all highly skilled. "If there is damage, it is because of bad equipment," he said. "During all these years, there has never been a ship sunk by Santos stevedores."

HEADLINE: CHINA SAID TO CURB FOREIGN RESEARCH

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIJING

 BODY:
China appears to be moving to cut off access by foreign scholars to social survey data, according to Chinese academics and a secret document distributed recently.
The State Education Commission has already circulated a document that prohibits universities and other institutes from turning over to foreign scholars the results of social surveys, even if they were conducted as a joint effort. Now, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, one of China's most prominent academic institutions, is planning to draft similar guidelines. 
 Exchange programs between Chinese and foreign scholars were cut back drastically after the military crackdown on the democracy movement in June 1989 and have revived only slowly. This recent effort by Chinese authorities is likely to cast another pall over one of the most important channels of contact between China and the United States.
Foreign academics say the prospect of adopting such guidelines at the academy, which has 20 scholarly exchange agreements abroad, has already doomed some potential projects.
"It's best to stay away from cooperative survey projects, if you want to get approval," a Chinese scholar said.
 
Curbing Western Contacts
 These measures also coincide with a broader national effort to step up efforts to curb contact between Westerners and Chinese and to protect secrets, which in China could include almost anything.
At one institution, for instance, Chinese were instructed late last year not to allow foreigners to use telephone, facsimile and telex machines, as part of stricter secrecy rules. In political study sessions, they were told what not to say in front of foreigners.
The State Education Commission's document, No. 598, issued at the end of last year, applied to social research data and cited as an example opinion polls that shed light on public views toward the party and the Government.
The commission oversees universities and many other educational institutes throughout the nation. That the academy, which is not directly supervised by the commission, is drafting similar guidelines suggests there is a push for such controls from high-level leaders.
The impetus behind the guidelines is the belief that Western countries are eager to obtain information on social trends and developments in China to sharpen their efforts to influence and change China's political system.
So far only two projects are believed to have been directly affected by the document. One was a project to examine marital issues and the other examined political and economic changes at the local levels.

HEADLINE: New Software for Apple Links With I.B.M. Units

BYLINE: By EBEN SHAPIRO

 BODY:
As part of an increased effort to attract corporate customers, Apple Computer Inc. yesterday introduced its first software package that allows users of large networks of its Macintosh personal computers to communicate easily with I.B.M. mainframes and minicomputers.
Analysts said the Apple software was an improvement over the cumbersome communications software now available from third-party suppliers. 
 "Apple is taking ownership of the problem," said John C. McCarthy, an analyst with Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass.
Last fall, Apple embarked on an ambitious plan to increase its share of the personal computer market from about 11 percent to 20 percent, primarily by increasing volume by cutting prices. But Apple is also trying to make greater inroads into the business market, which accounts for as much as half of all personal computer sales. Apple now has about 8 percent of the corporate market, Mr. McCarthy estimates.
 
Help for Margins
 Corporations tend to buy more powerful systems, which provide higher profit margins to computer makers, an important consideration for Apple, whose margins have suffered from the aggressive price cuts.
Ed Forman, marketing manager of large business for Apple, said the company was working to overcome several myths about its personal computers, including the perception that there is not enough business software available for Apple personal computers. A growing number of business programs, including the popular 1-2-3 spreadsheet from the Lotus Development Corporation, will soon be available for the Macintosh.
Apple must also dispel the notion that the Macintosh "is a system for individuals" instead of for entire corporations, Mr. Forman said.
Corporations have also worried about being able to connect their large mainframes to Apple's personal computers. Yesterday's introduction of the new communications software, called the SNA.ps family of products, is another step in convincing corporate customers that Macintoshes can be easily connected to mainframe computers made by the International Business Machines Corporation, Mr. Forman and analysts said.
But improving networking is only part of the problem. Mr. McCarthy said that to be successful in the corporate market, Apple must establish a strong corporate sales staff and convince third-party retailers to put together packages of Apple equipment and custom-designed software for different businesses.
Mr. Forman said Apple was reorganizing its sales force to be more responsive to corporations.
Apple executives said yesterday's product announcement was unrelated to the recent talks between I.B.M. and Apple.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Down Amid Concern About Rates and Policies

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar fell yesterday as concerns about interest rates and reactions to the weekend meeting of Group of Seven monetary officials eroded the gains the dollar chalked up last week.
Investors had bought the dollar on the expectation that the officials would not take a firm stand on limiting its advance. The dollar has risen 20 percent recently as the United States economy has shown signs of reviving. 
 At their meeting in London on Sunday, the finance officials -- who represented the United States, Britain, Canada, Italy, Germany, France and Japan -- issued a statement saying they would intervene jointly in the markets "if necessary." Traders interpreted that as a loose agreement to curb the dollar's gains.
 
Higher German Rates Expected
 Analysts also said the dollar slipped on speculation that Germany would announce higher interest rates later this week. An increase in German rates would make the mark more valuable and decrease demand for the dollar and other currencies.
Robert Ryan, corporate foreign exchange manager with the Bank of New York, said the dollar was also caught in a crossfire as nervous traders sold the Japanese yen and bought the mark because of scandals involving several big brokerage firms in Tokyo.
The presidents of the Nomura Securities Company, the world's largest securities firm, and of the Nikko Securities Company resigned yesterday, after disclosures that their companies had improperly compensated the firms' biggest clients for their losses.
The dollar fell to 1.7830 marks in New York, from 1.8015 late Friday. In earlier European trading, the dollar dropped to 1.7845 marks, from late Friday's 1.7990.
 
Yen Mixed Against Dollar
 In New York the yen managed a small gain against the dollar, which closed at 138.70 yen, down from 138.90 late Friday. In Tokyo overnight, the dollar rose 0.72 yen to a closing 139.77 yen, and in London, it was quoted at 138.85 yen.
The British pound gained against the dollar, rising to $1.6470 in New York, from $1.6260. In London, the pound jumped to $1.6425, from $1.6310 late Friday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's prices, included: 1.5345 Swiss francs, down from 1.54785; 6.0545 French francs, down from 6.1225; 1,326.50 Italian lire, down from 1,341.25, and 1.14255 Canadian dollars, down from 1.14325.
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates Friday, included: 1.5335 Swiss francs, down from 1.5460; 6.0595 French francs, down from 6.1115; 2.0098 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0265; 1,328.00 Italian lire, down from 1,338.25, and 1.1427 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1428.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Short-Term Notes Down Slightly

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were little changed in slow trading yesterday, as short-term notes and bills gave ground, while longer-term issues improved somewhat.
Traders said they were surprised by the decline in the price of some short-term maturities, given the big drop in American equity prices, the Japanese stock scandal and a fall in the Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 leading spot commodity prices for the second straight session. 
 All of those factors tend to encourage investors to seek haven in high-quality, very liquid short-term investments like Treasury bills and notes.
"There has been some ammo for the short end of the market, but it didn't have any impact," said David R. Duerson, manager of government securities trading at the Security Pacific Corporation.
 
'Heavy Supply Coming'
 Mr. Duerson and others said the slight selloff probably was attributable in part to the coming auctions of new two-year and five-year notes. They also pointed to some mild disappointment that the weekend meeting of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations did not produce an agreement to make the Federal Reserve lower short-term interest rates as a way of lowering the value of the dollar on foreign exchange markets. And with the end of the second quarter looming, many accounts are content to close their books now, rather than pick the current moment to take on new risk.
"There is very heavy supply coming, volume is weak and clients are not doing business," another government bond trader said. "Unless we get some good business at the auctions, we are in for a rough week."
Today, the Treasury is expected to sell $12.5 billion worth of new two-year Treasury notes. That auction will be followed on Wednesday with the sale of $9.25 billion worth of new five-year notes.
In when-issued trading late yesterday, the two-year notes were offered at a price to yield 6.99 percent. The five-year notes were offered in when-issued trading at a price to yield 7.95 percent.
Demand at the Treasury's weekly auction of three-month and six-month bills was good, dealers said.
At the auction, the three-month bills were sold at an average discount rate of 5.58 percent, down from the 5.61 percent average rate at last week's sale.
Bids for the new six-month bills produced an average discount rate of 5.76 percent, compared with the 5.79 percent average rate a week ago.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 1/8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered in late trading at 95 7/8, unchanged on the day, to yield 8.50 percent, the same yield as late on Friday.
Among outstanding note issues, the 8 percent 10-year notes were offered at 97 7/8 in late trading, down 1/32, to yield 8.31 percent. And the 6 3/4 percent two-year notes were offered at 99 3/4, unchanged on the day, to yield 6.88 percent.
In the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds, traders said prices of most issues were unchanged in very lethargic trading.
The tempo was much the same in the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds.
Market participants said prices of the most widely quoted securities were little changed in thin, boring trading.
Following are the results of yesterday's auctions of new three-month and six-month Treasury bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Average Price	98.590	97.088	Discounted Rate	5.58%	5.76%	Coupon Yield	5.75%	6.03%	High Price	98.595	97.093	Discounted Rate	5.56	5.75%	Coupon Yield	5.73	5.75%	Low Price	98.590	97.083	Discounted Rate	5.58%	5.77%	Coupon Yield	5.75.%	6.04%	Accepted at low price	58%	45%	Total applied for	$41,439,295	$30,185,215	Accepted	$10,205,560	$10,221,720	N.Y. applied for	$38,515,650	$27,188,560	N.Y. accepted	$9,016,985	$9,042,420	Noncompetitive	$1,586,685	$1,028,995	
Both these issues are dated June 27, 1991. The three-month bills mature Sept. 26, 1991, and the six-month bills, Dec. 26,1991.

HEADLINE: Dexter M. Keezer Is Dead at 95; Economist Gauged U.S. Outlook

BYLINE: By ALFONSO A. NARVAEZ

 BODY:
Dexter M. Keezer, an economist who developed techniques of projecting the nation's business climate, died yesterday in the Orleans Nursing and Convalescent Center in Orleans, Mass. He was 95 years old and lived in Truro, Mass.
He died of congestive heart failure, a family spokesman said. 
 Dr. Keezer, a pragmatic economist. gained worldwide attention while he was with the McGraw-Hill Publishing Company, which he had joined in 1945. He created the department of economics there and developed annual surveys of capital spending and of research and development expenditures by many of the nation's leading businesses.
The annual surveys, which were begun in 1948, were used as indicators of the nation's potential for economic prosperity. With some adjustments for historical experience they were also used for forecasting the business climate, said Douglas Greenwald, who became manager of economic services at McGraw-Hill when Dr. Keezer retired in 1960.
Dr. Keezer, who had been a vice president at McGraw-Hill, remained with the company as an economic adviser until 1971.
"He was the No. 1 person in the business economics field," Mr. Greenwald said.
 
Active in Civic Affairs
 In retirement Dr. Keezer became involved in civic affairs in Truro, on Cape Cod. He was president of the Truro Neighborhood Association and in the mid-1970's campaigned against nude bathing at Brush Hollow Beach. He also served as Truro's representative to the Cape Cod National Seashore Advisory Commission and was a supporter of the Truro Conservation Trust.
Dexter Merriam Keezer was born Aug. 24, 1895, in Acton, Mass. He had been a teacher, journalist and government official before being named president of Reed College in Portland, Ore., in 1934. He was then one of the youngest college presidents in the nation. Previously, he had been a reporter at The Denver Times and at the Washington bureau of Scripps-Howard newspapers and, from 1929 to 1933, associate editor of The Baltimore Sun.
Dr. Keezer graduated from Amherst College in 1920, from Cornell University in 1923 and received a Ph.D. in 1925 from Brookings Graduate School of Economics and Government. He served in an Army machine-gun battalion in World War I and taught at Cornell, the University of Colorado, the University of North Carolina and Dartmouth College.
He was an expert on consumer problems and was executive director of the Consumer Advisory Board of the National Recovery Administration in 1933-34.
 
Service in Various Posts
 After leaving Reed College in 1942, he returned to Washington to serve as deputy administrator of the Office of Price Administration. He was also a member of the National Advisory Committee of the National Youth Administration, served as an economic adviser at the United States Embassy in London and was a member of the War Labor Board and of the Emergency Mediation Board.
He was the author or editor of several books, including "Are We Slaves of Some Defunct Economist" and "The Light That Flickers: A View of College Education Which Contrasts Promise and Performance and Suggests Improvements." He was the co-author of "New Forces in American Business" and "Making Capitalism Work."
He was also a director of the American National Theater and Academy and was a trustee of Elmira College.
He is survived by his wife, Anne; two daughters, Anne Read of Washington, and Berthe Ladd of Dover, Mass.; five grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.

Picking Ethiopian Food: It's a Political Decision

BYLINE: By KAREN DE WITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 24

 BODY:
The Asmara Restaurant in the Adams-Morgan neighborhood a few miles north of the White House was once billed as an Ethiopian-Eritrean restaurant. Now it is strictly Eritrean.
The political and ethnic allegiances among the disparate ethnic groups in the thriving 50,000-member Ethiopian community here are being stretched to the limits these days in the wake of last month's ouster of the Marxist Government of Mengistu Haile Mariam. Nowhere is that more apparent than in the community's dozen or so restaurants, concentrated on 18th Street and Columbia Road in Northwest Washington. 
 Eritreans, by and large, go to Eritrean-owned restaurants. Amharas go to Amhara-owned restaurants. Tigreans, Oromos and others from about 80 Ethiopian ethnic groups disperse themselves wherever they feel most comfortable.
There are Ethiopian restaurants that won't play Eritrean songs, and Eritrean restaurants whose patrons turn off Ethiopians of other ethnic groups. The politics among the groups has become so fragmented that some are boycotting one another's restaurants. And whichever one a non-Ethiopian diner tries, he or she may be served up a lesson in political correctness.
Ethiopians are riven by numerous issues: whether Eritrea, a territory that most nations still consider just the northern province of Ethiopia, should become independent; what the makeup of the government in the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa should be; who should control that government, and how other ethnic groups fit into that plan.
"This is a very emotional issue," said Shimlias Asafa, a taxi driver who is Amhara, a member of the minority that accounts for one-quarter of Ethiopia's population but that until last month dominated the country. "We are the same blood, same culture, same people who have been operating under a misguided Marxist-Leninist ideology. We are one country."
But at the Asmara Restaurant on Columbia Road, owned by an Eritrean, Tesfamichel Berhane, such sentiments were derided. "They never cared about a united Ethiopia before," Mr. Berhane said, referring to Amharas.
"They don't come to our restaurants anymore," he added.
These people with high cheekbones, delicate features and dark, expressive eyes may seem of a piece to Americans, who may think of Ethiopia as a land of famine. But their politics separate them.
The political ideology is strongest among the Eritreans, who have fought for independence for nearly 30 years. The province developed a separate identity in the decades it was controlled by Italy, and its inhabitants maintain that Eritrea was unfairly handed over to Ethiopia by the British, who seized it in World War II.
In the crowded coffee bar of the Addis Ababa Restaurant on 18th Street, Gezahegne Bekele, an Amhara and an economist who works for the General Accounting Office, sat at a table of Ethiopians who argued about the separatism of the Eritreans and the new, United States-backed Tigre-dominated Government that now controls Addis Ababa and the southern part of the country.
"Where does this Government get its legitimacy?" he asked. "It doesn't include all the various views of all Ethiopians."
The Tigreans, who make up 10 percent of the country's population, generally favor a unified Ethiopia. The Amharas were glad to see Colonel Mengistu and his Communist Government depart but are wary of the Tigreans and adamantly oppose Eritrean separation.
At the Addis Ababa Restaurant, Mr. Bekele lamented the current fragmentation in Washington's Ethiopian community. "It would be a shame to make the Ethiopian crisis simply an ethnic crisis," he said. "We have eight million people in a country of 50 million close to starvation. We could lose three million people unless we get substantial emergency assistance. The masses of Ethiopians have that in common."

HEADLINE: Work Force In Bridgeport Is Squeezed By 2 Laws

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRIDGEPORT, Conn., June 24

 BODY:
Bridgeport has cut its work force so deeply that it is caught in a bind between the state's labor laws and welfare laws that threatens to leave the city both dirtier and poorer.
As the city lays off custodians, parks workers and street cleaners, it has little choice but to take away the jobs of the welfare recipients who assist them as part of the state's workfare program. Connecticut, like most states, bars people in workfare programs from taking the place of municipal employees. 
 Already the city has removed more than 300 people from crews helping to maintain parks and schools, and as many as 900 more welfare recipients may be working in violation of labor laws.
But Connecticut also penalizes cities that fail to give work or training to at least two-thirds of those eligible for local workfare. If the city is forced to eliminate hundreds of workfare positions, it could lose hundreds of thousands of dollars in state aid.
 
'A Heavy Commitment'
 "We want to comply with the labor law," said Bridgeport's welfare director, Roberto Garcia. "But there's such a heavy commitment in municipal work sites that we couldn't comply with the labor law without violating the welfare law."
The workfare puzzle is only one example of how Bridgeport is learning what many of its residents have long known: that being poor can be expensive.
Even before Mayor Mary C. Moran turned to bankruptcy court this month, department heads with slashed budgets were searching for ways to get their work done, and finding that they could not turn to workfare participants, or even to volunteers.
Paul Boldin, coordinator for social services for the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees at its headquarters in Washington, said that officials of financially strapped cities were often tempted to use welfare recipients as free labor.
"It abuses them as much as it abuses the regular employees," he said.
He said that his union had serious conflicts with workfare programs in New York State, especially around Buffalo, in the early 1980's, and that his union was closely watching New York City, now that recession has returned and city employees are being laid off.
In 1981 Connecticut began requiring able-bodied people on local welfare, or general assistance, either to work or to enroll in education or training programs to remain eligible for aid.
The state offered communities an incentive: if a city found jobs or training for two-thirds of those eligible for workfare, the state would pay 100 percent of their benefits, rather than the usual 90 percent. It would also pay the city $50 a month for each person on workfare, to cover the costs of administering the program.
 
Complaint From Unions
 Over the last three years, as Bridgeport cut 1,000 jobs from a work force of 4,700, the number of workfare participants put to work at city sites grew as the number of men and women on general assistance tripled, to 3,800.
Mr. Garcia, the welfare director, said he had 2,700 people, 70 percent of those eligible, on workfare last month. At that rate, the $50-a-month payments alone would be worth $1.6 million a year to his department.
On May 15, however, the Connecticut State Board of Labor Relations, responding to a complaint from two unions that suffered layoffs in 1990, ordered Bridgeport to stop assigning workfare participants "bargaining-unit work."
In effect, if the city laid off custodians, it also had to "lay off" the workfare participants assigned to help them.
Since then, the question for city officials has been how broadly the order affects the 1,200 welfare recipients working at municipal job sites. The answer, with a work force that is nearly all unionized, could be all 1,200.
Mr. Garcia has plans for what he describes as new "makework" programs. "We could count a lot of things in the city," he said. But if Bridgeport falls out of compliance with workfare, penalties could come due within a few months.
The state, however, has not decided whether it would immediately pursue penalties, said Claudette J. Beaulieu, spokeswoman for the State Department of Income Maintenance.
The penalty is the elimination of state reimbursement for however many welfare recipients the city falls short of the two-thirds level. If, for example, Bridgeport's average annual cost was $6,000 a person and it fell 100 people short, over a year the penalties would add up to $600,000.
Other Connecticut cities are also caught between the two laws. In Waterbury, the welfare director, Debra Shapiro, cut 150 jobs, 25 percent of her total, because of layoffs in the police, parks and adult education departments.
But Bridgeport relies most on municipal work, and therefore will feel the loss of the jobs more and the risk of financial penalties sooner.
Already 259 people have stopped helping school custodians.
Almost certain to go are 712 men on field crews used to clean up littered lots, which abound in Bridgeport's poorer neighborhoods.
And the Parks Department has given up the 50 laborers who, by working 20-hour weeks picking up litter, freed its employees to mow and maintain Bridgeport's more than 40 parks.
The budget that takes effect July 1 halves the money for parks, to $2.1 million, and leaves 28 employees, down from 83 a few years ago. Only 10 are workers who actually care for the parks that gave Bridgeport the nickname of Park City.
So after July 1, said the parks superintendent, Phillip C. Handy, those workers will tend only five parks including the two largest: Seaside, on Long Island Sound, and Beardsley, home to the city zoo.
The other parks will not be mowed and their trash will not be picked up.
"No anything," Mr. Handy said. "The litter barrels will be taken out of there. The grass is going to grow two feet high, so the whole area will be a dump."
Business and neighborhood groups have expressed interest in taking over other parks. But those volunteer efforts appear to be barred by contract provisions that prohibit the city from subcontracting work done by union members.
"I thought there were ways around it," Mr. Handy said, "but every time I find one, I'm told you can't do it that way."
The unions that sought the order, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, and the National Association of Government Employees, are confident that labor law bars both workfare participants and volunteers as replacements for their laid-off members, and in any case they doubt the utility of volunteers.
"What volunteer is going to sweep City Hall?" asked Wayne Gilbert, a national representative for the association. "Who's going to volunteer to clean the toilets? If I see someone doing that, I'll give him a gold badge."

Rosy Accounting At Japan's Banks

BYLINE: By James Sterngold

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
A FUNNY thing happened to Japan's big banks on the way to reporting their annual profits.
For months newspapers have been filled with stories of the huge financial problems at the banks' real estate affiliates and the high level of corporate bankruptcies here. 
 By most measures it seemed that tens of billions of dollars in loans had gone down the drain in the tumult. Yet when the moment came for the banks to come clean, most reported not the big write-offs that have been afflicting their American rivals, but a reduction in their provisions for bad loans.
Take what analysts regard as two of the most illustrative examples, the Sumitomo Bank, a large shareholder in Goldman, Sachs & Company, and the Fuji Bank, the parent of Heller Financial Inc.
Sumitomo reported a 22.3 percent decline in net profits, to $970 million at current exchange rates. Fuji's net profits slumped 18.7 percent, to $860 million. The declines were largely because of falling profits from securities sales and a squeeze on bank margins because of the rising interest rates they had to pay for deposits.
More to the point, each had to stage expensive rescues of affiliates. But both actually reported a large reduction in their provision for loan losses at the end of the fiscal year, which ended March 31.
Welcome to Japanese accounting.
To be sure, some problems do show up, as in the lower profits. But there were no cases like the Bank of New England and no collapses that taxed the deposit insurance fund. In fact, the Government insurance fund has never had to pay out a cent on a failed bank. Analysts say it is not because the banks are impervious to misfortune, but because of lax accounting rules and the fact that regulators emphasize not public disclosure but cooperation with the industry when troubles arise.
"The system is non-transparent in so many areas," said Roger Arner, an executive vice president at the Japan office of Moody's Investors Service. "You have to operate on trust." Added Stuart Matthews, an analyst here for Barclays de Zoette Wedd, "We just don't have the real numbers."
According to a report by Alicia Ogawa, an analyst at S. G. Warburg Securities, the value of bankruptcies jumped last year to 1.99 trillion yen, or $14.3 billion at current exchange rates, yet loan-loss write-offs and provisions for bad debts at big Japanese banks fell by 42 percent from the previous year, to $1.1 billion.
Take Sumitomo's case. It lost its chairman, Ichiro Isoda, when he resigned last year to take responsibility for the bank's role in a huge scandal. Itoman & Company, an old-line textile trading company long affiliated with Sumitomo, had gone on a speculative binge, borrowing heavily and investing billions of dollars in real estate and paintings.
Since then real estate prices have dropped, it has been disclosed that the company paid more than double the value of the paintings, and Itoman has been left with nearly $10 billion in shaky borrowings. Although it had no contractual obligation, Sumitomo stepped in to effectively guarantee Itoman's loans and provide more financing.
In Japan, banks can wait up to a year after a borrower stops paying interest on a loan before it is counted as nonperforming, while in the United States banks generally have only 90 days.
Sumitomo is believed to have nearly $2 billion in direct loans to Itoman and contingent liabilities for most of the rest, but this has not had the slightest impact on Sumitomo's earnings or balance sheet.
That was good enough for Japan's regulators, and even for Japanese stockholders, who have not dumped the bank's shares. But it was not good enough for Moody's. Last week the rating agency said it was lowering the rating on Sumitomo's long-term deposits by two notches, to AA3. Moody's also announced that it was reviewing Fuji's ratings because of the bank's heavy loans to the troubled real estate sector in Japan and abroad.
Fuji has had three well-publicized problems. One involves a construction and real estate company, the Tobishima Corporation. It is currently struggling under what is reported to be about $7 billion in shaky loans. Fuji is Tobishima's main bank, and thus is leading the effort to rescue the company with a restructuring and more credit.
It was also reported recently that a Fuji subsidiary based in the Cayman Islands suffered a $310 million loss from securities trading. Yet that did not appear to have taken a bite of Fuji's earnings.
And Fuji appears to have had some indirect involvement in the Itoman scandal. A credit association affiliated with Fuji, Osaka Fumin, had lent heavily to business partners of Itoman, and is reported to have been near collapse with nearly $900 million in bad loans. Because of its association, Fuji stepped in and reportedly sent 11 of its executives and former executives to take control of Osaka Fumin and lent more than $700 million to the credit association to keep it afloat. Yet, Fuji also reported a big drop in its loan-loss provisions. "Nobody is suggesting that these banks are going bust, but it leaves so much uncertainty about their real positions," said Mr. Matthews, the Barclays analyst. "Japanese investors just have remarkable faith in their system."

HEADLINE: With 7 Days Left, New York City Grapples With Budget Conflicts

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
Seven days before the start of its new fiscal year, New York City's political leaders yesterday groped through a maze of conflicting proposals to keep the city budget balanced, including a move to save money by stretching out payments to municipal pension funds.
Struggling with the city's worst fiscal problems since the crisis of the mid-1970's, negotiators for Mayor David N. Dinkins and municipal unions hope the changes in the pension payments could save hundreds of millions of dollars in the coming year, people close to the talks said. 
 Such a move, like refinancing a mortgage, would amount to making the payments over a longer period, effectively burdening future taxpayers. It could also face many legal and technical obstacles and may not be done in time to help now.
 
Fiscal Uncertainties
 At City Hall, in daylong negotiations in the marble corridors and paneled offices, it was far from certain that Mayor Dinkins and the City Council could resolve their half-billion-dollar differences over closing a $3.5 billion gap in the $29 billion city budget for the fiscal year that starts on July 1 and whether the State Legislature would pass needed taxes and aid. Yesterday, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo spoke of a plan to restore about $360 million of spending that he had vetoed, including $60 million that he said would help the city.
 "The good news is we're past the name-calling," said the chairman of the Council's Finance Committee, Herbert E. Berman of Brooklyn. "The bad news is we still don't have a budget."
The Council is arguing for deeper cuts to avoid more than half of the $776 million in higher property taxes the Mayor wants. In Albany, prospects for Mr. Dinkins's demands for $335 million in higher city personal income taxes and $328 million in relaxation of mandated spending remained cloudy as lawmakers jockeyed to use the requests as negotiating chips for their own spending priorities.
 
Much Higher Stakes
 At the same time, a leading business group, the New York Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said it could not support the income tax increase because Mr. Dinkins had failed to win union concessions or make significant long-term savings that could avert the need for such taxes.
Confusion and recriminations envelop City Hall every year at budget season, but this year the stakes are much higher and the rumblings much more ominous amid a regional recession and with the state's own budget passed 65 days late and still not fully resolved. Because of the city's brush with bankruptcy 16 years ago, its budget is subject to tight controls and scrutiny by a state body, the Financial Control Board, that could impose binding powers over its spending if it failed to balance its budget.
That makes the next week a high-stakes race against time. But there is also a sense that even if the budget is adopted on time, its effect on life in the city may be so severe as to make the Mayor and the Council immediately start striving again for money from union concessions or from the Municipal Assistance Corporation -- a state body set up to help bail the city out of its last crisis -- in an effort to undo the worst of the cuts.
 
Beyond Tolerance
 The Council leadership contends that by pressing for about $465 million more in cuts in city services than the $1.5 billion Mr. Dinkins has already proposed, it can not only stave off much of the property tax increases he has been seeking but also may help win concessions on wages or benefits from municipal unions that have so far resisted, even if such help come only after the budget is adopted.
Yesterday, the Mayor and his aides again attacked the Council's proposed cuts as beyond New Yorkers' tolerance and urged community groups to lobby against the Council's plans.
The Council leaders said the Mayor's office had rebuffed its demands for a greater say in precisely how money should be appropriated and over what conditions the Council can attach to spending. That is especially important since if new money from union concessions or other sources becomes available after the budget is adopted, the Council worries that it would have limited say in deciding how it should be spent.
"If they'd spent all this energy getting labor and productivity savings, we wouldn't be here," said Peg Breen, a spokeswoman for the Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone.
Almost every city agency had a new horror story to tell about what would happen if the worst of the cuts came true, but sorting out just which ones were likely to be made was impossible as both sides continued to debate the potential effects.
Among the specific proposals that mayoral advisers questioned was one to eliminate 75 property-tax auditors, which they asserted would save a few million dollars but cost hundreds of millions, and another to eliminate 160 traffic-control agents from midtown Manhattan, which they said would cost the city up to $200 million in Federal funds because of the air-quality violations likely to be caused by tie-ups in traffic.
 
Health Risks Stressed
 After the City Board of Health warned that some of the proposed cuts in health programs would be so severe as to risk causing a public health emergency and violating various regulations, Mr. Dinkins and the Council leaders said they had agreed in principle to avoid cuts that would jeopardize health or break mandates, though city lawyers said that might ultimately entail relaxing some of the mandates.
But it was clear that the Dinkins administration, rushing to propose its budget last month and hoping to prompt concessions from unions and the state, had included many proposed cuts that could run afoul of legal requirements.
Other city agencies complained that the Council's proposals would cripple their function. The Department of Invesitgation, which reviews allegations of corruption in government, would have its staff cut from 410, to 270 people, virtually eliminating its inspector-general system in which investigators are assigned to monitor particular agencies. The system was created in the wake of the municipal corruption scandals just five years ago.
"A lot of agencies would end up having no real coverage," one department official said.
The City Planning Department said the Council's plan would cut it from 360 workers, to 193, leaving about one planner per 100,000 city residents, instead of three. The 10-member office that handles the city's relations with television production companies and film makers, an important local industry, would be cut in half.
In Albany, Governor Cuomo, under pressure to restore some of the $900 million worth of spending that he vetoed from the state budget earlier this month, outlined yesterday a sketchy plan for adding back roughly $360 million.
"We don't have a plan as such," Mr. Cuomo said, "because I don't see the point of a plan."
He said roughly $60 million of the spending he was recommending be restored would benefit New York City.
The Governor's plan does not call for any new taxes. Rather, it calls for increased tax collections, additional bond sales and further cuts in Medicaid. But legislative leaders, emerging from a meeting with the Governor yesterday afternoon, seemed nonplused by the plan and said only that they were waiting for more details.

GRAPHIC: Chart: 'The Budget Battles'
 
New York
 New York City: A dispute involving less than two percent of the total budget continued to separate Mayor David N. Dinkins and New York's City Council yesterday.
The previously unbudgeable $450 million or so gap between them appeared to narrwing ever so slightly.
Publicly, the climate was conciliatory even as both sides lobbed potshots behind the scenes and marshalled evidence of each other's inadequacies so that the blame for a budget that is unlikely to please anybody could be properly apportioned later.
Mayoral representatives told the Council's finance staff that some of its proposed cuts are illusory. The Council informally agreed to restore up to $60 million in what it called "life-threatening" cuts already made by the Mayor.
Threatened with thousands of layoffs -- 8,000 under the Mayor's plan and 7,000 more under the Council's -- representatives of several municipal unions actually did negotiate yesterday.
 Albany: The stalemate over a state budget continued. But pressure increased on the Republican majority in the Senate to act this week on the tax package Mr. Dinkins has proposed to help close his projected deficit.
 
Connecticut
 The question appears to be not whether there will be an income tax, but how much?
Democratic leaders in the House would close the state's budget gap by making a broad based, progressive income tax the single biggest revenue source. Senate Democrats are mulling a smaller tax.
Most of the plans under consideration would raise state taxes by $1 billion or more. The state would also borrow more than $900 million to cover the deficit for the fiscal year that ends June 30.
 
New Jersey
 Also facing a July 1 deadline -- and a statutory requirement that the state balance its budget -- New Jersey legislators were seeking to close a $1.5 billion gap in the $14.3 billion budget proposed by Gov. Jim Florio.
Mr. Florio wants, among other things, to persuade state employee unions to give back $280 million in wages and benefits.
If the unions balk, Mr. Florio has threatened at least 4,000 more layoffs. But yesterday, Democratic leaders in the Assembly said layoffs could be avoided, offering more optimistic revenue projections and relying on a change in the way Medicaid bills are reimbursed at state hospitals. (pg. B4)

HEADLINE: GERMANY TO HELP SOVIETS OBTAIN AID

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KINZER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BONN, June 24

 BODY:
Chancellor Helmut Kohl will meet with Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union in advance of the meeting of the seven leading industrial democracies in July to persuade the Soviet leader to accept free-market reforms bold enough to generate a major infusion of Western aid.
A Bonn spokesman said today that the two leaders would meet in Kiev on July 5, 10 days before the seven-nation meeting in London. 
 Mr. Gorbachev has been invited to London to meet with the seven leaders at the end of their annual conference. Although he has been vague on what he hopes to accomplish, Mr. Gorbachev has indicated that he might seek large amounts of economic help, and Mr. Kohl is likely to be his strongest advocate.
Earlier, some Soviet officials were talking of needing $100 billion over five years, but more recently, in the face of skepticism in the West, they have said they did not expect specific aid packages to emerge from London.
The question of aid to Moscow is being debated as Mr. Gorbachev faces a growing challenge from Soviet hard-liners, who charge that moves toward reform are not being reciprocated from abroad. [Page A16.]
Representatives of the seven nations agreed in principle in London on Sunday that the Soviet Union should be offered a limited role in the International Monetary Fund. Such a move would give the Soviet Union access to technical help on economic reform, but would not bring an immediate infusion of money from the fund,
Advisers to Mr. Kohl said they believe the seven industrialized nations will agree to a major aid program only if it is detailed and tied to drastic economic reforms. They are hoping that during his visit to Kiev, Mr. Kohl will be able to impress that point on the Soviet leader, and induce him to present a program of sweeping economic change at the summit in London.
Mr. Gorbachev needs to convince skeptical leaders like President Bush that he is truly prepared to reverse the course of Soviet economic history. Mr. Bush has been reluctant to support major Western aid to the Soviet Union, though he has indicated willingness to provide expert technical advice.
 
Chancellor Kohl's Lobby
 "At first, Gorbachev wasn't going to be invited to the London summit, but various countries spoke up, and after awhile the Americans agreed," said an aide to Chancellor Kohl. "You are going to see the same process at the summit itself. If the right program is presented in the right way, a consensus will develop.
"I can't guess the size of the package," the aide said. "The public likes gigantic figures, but if the proposal is just to commit $100 billion over five years, no one will accept it. We're looking for a continuing investment program, and as each step is successfully reached, we will help support the next one."
In public statements and conversations with leaders, Mr. Kohl has already begun lobbying on behalf of the Soviets.
"It is in our common interests to provide effective help -- aid and self-help -- to the Soviet Union and the young democracies of Eastern Europe in this critical transition phase," he said when he welcomed Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada to Bonn recently.
Participants in the annual economic conference of the Group of Seven, besides Chancellor Kohl, Mr. Mulroney and President Bush, will be the leaders of France, Britain, Italy and Japan.
German officials acknowledge that, because of history and geography, Germany has special reasons for wanting to help the Soviets. But they said Germany would only support an aid package that was accompanied by profound economic reforms. Germany has committed itself to about $31 billion in loans, grants and credits to the Soviet Union, in part because of Moscow's assent to the unification of Germany. Much of the money has gone to provide housing and other aid for Soviet soldiers returning home.
 
'A Partnership of Governments'
 The Germans have traditionally seen large-scale business interests in the East, but besides the profits to be won, they are concerned that a breakdown in the Soviet Union could lead to colossal dislocation, with millions of Soviet and East European refugees.
"We want to make suggestions, but we can't behave as if we were the World Bank going into Uganda, designing a plan for them and then saying they have to accept or else there is no money," Economic Minister Jurgen Mollemann said in an interview. "It has to be a partnership of governments."
Mr. Mollemann and other officials said that the emergence of Boris N. Yeltsin had helped Mr. Gorbachev's position by showing the Soviet Union's progress toward democracy, and that overtures to the Baltic republics or an easing of emigration policies in the next few weeks would help even more.
A Soviet concession to Japan on the disputed Kurile Islands would be necessary before the Japanese Prime Minister could support an aid program, officials here said.
"The reluctance on the Japanese side is even greater than the reluctance on the American side," said Otto Lambsdorff, who heads the Free Democratic Party and is an important ally of Mr. Kohl. "
 
A London Show-Stealer?
 "Without Mr. Gorbachev, we would not have German unification," he said. "We also know that if there is a serious economic collapse in the Soviet Union, there could be mass migration from East to West that would cause great problems in Germany and other countries of the European community."
"Unfortunately, the Soviet Union and Mr. Gorbachev have lost six years, and the situation there has become very bad," he continued. "The list of Gorbachev's economic advisers is longer than the list of Italian Prime Ministers over the last 10 years.
"No money will be given without reforms, but you cannot have reforms without money," Mr. Lambsdorff said. "What Mr. Gorbachev is going to put on the table, nobody knows. One thing for me is clear: he will steal the show at the G-7 summit, because no one is as brilliant at public relations as Mr. Gorbachev."

HEADLINE: Bank Reports On Assets Are Doubted

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 24

 BODY:
A growing number of economists and analysts are saying that many weak banks, including some of the nation's largest, have overstated the amount of capital they have on hand to absorb loan losses, and that a taxpayer bailout may be a stronger possibility than has been acknowledged by the banks and the Bush Administration.
Because the banking industry's capital is measured by historical prices, which reflect values when the loans were made, not reflected is the fact that many bank assets have deteriorated because of real estate and third world loans and other investments made amid the speculative excesses of the last decade. 
 A recent study of 39 failed banks by the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, found that the quarterly reports filed by banks with Government examiners on their financial health "failed to provide regulators with advanced warning of the true magnitude of the deterioration in the banks' financial condition and performance."
The report found that while the banks followed standard accounting practices and recorded reserves of $2.1 billion to reflect the decreased values of their assets, regulators later found that $9.4 billion was actually needed to reflect the market value of the assets when the banks collapsed. In other words, $7.3 billion in asset values simply vanished between the time the loans were made and when the institutions were seized.
Regulators attribute the discrepancy to the fact that bankers have been slow to recognize deterioration in asset values. Banking experts will not even venture a guess on how much the difference might be. Determining it would require re-evaluating bank assets across the country.
The report on bank failures by the General Accounting Office found that bank managers "have a strong incentive" to delay accounting for changing values of assets because it adds to the banks' expenses and reduces their capital. "It is likely that many open financial institutions have overstated the value of their troubled assets," the G.A.O. report said.
Most banks continued to post profits, unlike savings and loan associations. The Bush Administration has portrayed the banks' and saving industry's problems as distinct, and played down any talk of a possible bank bailout by taxpayers.
On Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady is expected to ask Congress for another $80 billion to continue the savings and loan bailout into next year. He has already asked for $70 billion to be lent to the bank insurance fund. "The truth of the matter" is that the banking industry's capital "has been largely overstated," said R. Dan Brumbaugh, who has written about the savings and loan crisis and is a former economist with the Federal Home Loan Bank Board.
 
More Banks Experimenting
 While the banking industry has been resistant to market-value accounting because it is more expensive to do and is subject to wide fluctuations, more banks are experimenting with disclosing the market value of many of their assets because of the increasing demand for it from shareholders and analysts.
"Market value is an estimate of liquidation and is of highly limited use to an ongoing concern," said William P. O'Halloran, controller of Suntrust Banks Inc. of Atlanta and the chairman of the American Bankers Association's accounting committee. "It comes up every 10 years but this time it has received a big impetus from the savings and loan mess."
Mr. O'Halloran, whose bank has begun taking steps to perform market accounting of some of its assets, said the official position of the American Bankers Association, the industry's largest trade group, had been to oppose moving from historical accounting to market accounting.
For more than a year, Administration officials have been insisting that the capital of the banks, estimated at $240 billion as of March 31, distinguishes them from the faltering savings and loan industry, whose capital, time has proved, was overstated by officials and savings executives during the 1980's. As Treasury Secretary Brady likes to put it, the two "are as different as chalk and cheese."
Representative Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of Brooklyn and a member of the House Banking Committee, bluntly disagrees with Mr. Brady. "The link between the two industries is that both used insured deposits, without adequate regulatory checks, to make dumb investments," Mr. Schumer said. "It's the same fundamental cause."
There is strong disagreement among officials and analysts about the best way to measure the industry's capital, or even whether the current standards have obscured the depths of the industry's difficulties.
Capital means the equity of stockholders, or more simply, the difference between what a bank owns and what it owes. On a nationwide basis the industry has said its capital ratio is $6.65 for every $100 in assets, or more than double the minimum safety standard set by regulators.
Regulators derive the industry's capital figure by taking bank assets and subtracting liabilities and reserves set aside for possible losses. Since bank liabilities are easy to measure and primarily consist of bank deposits, experts look to the value of bank assets as the key to figuring out bank capital. These assets are measured by their value at the time they were acquired and not by the current market value.
The debate over how to measure bank assets is important now because of the record number of large-bank failures expected in 1991 and 1992, depleting the bank insurance fund and leaving it financed for the first time since its creation, during the Depression, by a taxpayer loan. Bank capital, in effect, serves the same function as the "deductible" in an insurance policy: it is paid initially to cover losses before the institution turns to the bank insurance fund.
At the latest count, regulators have identified 1,028 banks holding a record $418 billion in assets that are likely to fail. As more banks fail, the growing body of evidence strongly suggests that the industry's capital is less than the official estimates.
Among regulators, Richard C. Breeden, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, which helps to set accounting standards, has been most outspoken in repeatedly suggesting that banks value their assets not only at their historical, or book, value, but also at their current value, as investment banks and securities firms do.
 
Differences in Assets Cited
 On the other side of the issue, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Alan Greenspan, has maintained that commercial and savings banks deal primarily with different kinds of assets -- notably real estate -- that are more difficult to value readily than the assets of investment banks. Therefore, he says, the commercial and savings banks should not be forced to use the same kind of valuation techniques.
The industry and the Bush Administration have also largely opposed the reporting of bank assets by their current value, which would be far more expensive to perform as an accounting matter than accounting based on historical values.
The Financial Accounting Standards Board is developing new rules that would require banks and other companies to disclose in footnotes the current market value of the financial instruments and loans that they hold. The new rules would not affect the companies' income statements nor would they require the disclosure of the current value of real estate and other fixed assets.

HEADLINE: Higher Rents Approved For New York Tenants

 BODY:
Rent increases affecting at least two million New York City residents were approved last night by the Rent Guidelines Board at a raucous meeting.
The board, by a vote of 5 to 4, approved increases of 4 percent for one-year leases and 6.5 percent for two-year leases for 900,000 rent-stabilized apartments. 
 The board made its decision at a noisy but orderly public meeting at Police Headquarters at One Police Plaza. The increases are less than last year's, which were 4.5 percent for one-year leases and 7 percent for two-year leases.
Public hearings on various proposals were held last week, with tenant groups saying the proposed increases were too big and landlords arguing that they were not big enough.
A study by the staff of the Rent Guidelines Board concluded that building operating costs in the 12 months ending in April rose by an average of 5.1 percent. A study by a building owners' organization came up with a figure of 7.2 percent, citing steep rises in property taxes and water and sewage charges.
The Rent Guidelines Board is composed of nine members appointed by the mayor -- two representatives of tenants, two of property owners and five from the general public. Members must have at last five years' experience in finance, economics or housing.

HEADLINE: Chief of Employment Commission Criticizes G.O.P. Bill on Job Bias

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 24

 BODY:
The chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission today urged the White House to reject compromise civil rights bills fashioned by moderate Republicans.
In a letter to John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff, Evan J. Kemp, head of the commission, said the compromise would make it "extremely difficult for employers to use educational credentials and objective measures of academic achievement" like tests to determine who to hire or promote. 
 Mr. Kemp said precluding such criteria in employment decisions would undermine President Bush's efforts to improve the educational achievements of students and therefore make it more difficult for American businesses to compete.
"Notwithstanding employers' ever increasing dependence on individual competence in order to remain competitive, students, parents and teachers will not be able to point to a reward for learning if employers are for all practical purposes precluded from even inquiring about degree status, much less rewarding academic achievement," Mr. Kemp wrote in the letter, a copy of which was provided by an Administration official on the promise of anonymity.
 
First Senior Opposition
 Mr. Kemp's letter marks the first time any senior official within the Bush Administration has voiced outright opposition to the compromise measures drafted by Senator John C. Danforth, Republican of Missouri.
It is not clear whether Mr. Kemp's letter presaged a formal Administration announcement opposing Mr. Danforth's measure or if it indicated a split within the Administration over whether to accept to Missouri Republican's compromise.
When asked about the Danforth proposals two weeks ago, Mr. Bush was non-committal, saying, "Our people are taking a hard look at them," More recently he said he had reservations about them.
The letter was the first time Mr. Kemp has indicated his views on any version of the civil rights legislation, which has become embroiled in a debate over whether it would compel employers to adopt hiring and promotion quotas in order to avoid job discrimination lawsuits.
As head of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Mr. Kemp is charged with the enforcement of Federal employment discrimination laws, but to date he has sat on the sidelines during the heated debates over the measure.
Steve Hilton, a spokesman for Mr. Danforth, said the Senator had not seen Mr. Kemp's letter and therefore would not be able to comment on it.
A version of the civil rights bill supported by the House Democratic leadership was approved by the House June 5 by a margin that was 17 votes short of what would be required to override a Presidential veto.
Democratic leaders in the Senate are reluctant to bring that measure to a vote, and are hoping that a compromise could be worked out that would secure White House support.
Backers of the civil rights bill are seeking to overturn a series of 1989 Supreme Court decisions that made it harder to sue and collect damages in job discrimination cases. They are also seeking to increase the financial penalties employers would pay if they are found to have discriminated intentionally against women.
Mr. Kemp's letter underscores the main philosophical difference between supporters of both the Democrats' bill and Mr. Danforth's compromise and their opponents within the Administration, including C. Boyden Gray, the White House counsel.
According to the letter, Mr. Kemp beleives that Federal employment law as practiced during the last 20 years has fallen out of step with the current demands of the economy. In 1971, the Supreme Court that criteria for hiring and promotions like requiring a high school diploma or a college degree must be directly relevent to the job in question.

HEADLINE: Symbols Are Louder Than Action

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Tuesday, June 25

 BODY:
The sudden resignations on Monday of the presidents of two of Japan's most powerful securities houses, Nomura Securities and Nikko Securities, were clear attempts to use the traditional Japanese technique of self- sacrifice to halt the share-dealing scandal that has engulfed Kabutocho, Tokyo's counterpart to Wall Street.
But it is unlikely that the dramatic developments will put to rest two troubling questions highlighted by the scandal, the biggest to hit the financial industry here in more than two decades: How fair is this huge financial market to those outside its power structure, including foreign investors? Whose interests are the market's policemen protecting? 
 In fact, the regulators at the Finance Ministry are now coming under intense scrutiny, as an outraged public asks how the improper practices could be so widespread and yet not be stopped. The ministry's elite bureaucrats are being regarded with the skepticism previously reserved for Japanese brokers.
 
Impact on Trading
 The Finance Minister, Ryutaro Hashimoto, said that he was greatly distressed by the events and that his bureaucrats might have to consider toughening their oversight of the market. The Tokyo stock market's Nikkei index rose 141.96 points today, or six-tenths of a percent, to 23,907.42. On Monday, partly as an emotional reaction to news of the resignations, the Nikkei plunged 509.62 points.
Nevertheless, few experts expect big changes at the Finance Ministry, and thus in the industry. The most important reason is that Japan has none of the political oversight of regulators that exists in Washington.
There are no hearings, rarely do indignant legislators call officials on the carpet, and certainly no politicians are demanding that the public be offered better protection. As one foreign securities executive put it, the Japanese securities houses may have more to fear from the Securities and Exchange Commission in the United States if it chooses to investigate whether the Japanese firms have engaged in improper practices on Wall Street than from their own securities bureau.
Under Japan's political system, most legislation originates in the ministries before being passed by the Parliament. In addition, the Parliament does not have the direct oversight power over the regulators that Congress has in the United States.
The Finance Ministry's credibility suffered when the stock market crashed last year and again with disclosures this year that several big banks had been involved in speculative lending. The heads of three of Japan's largest banks have resigned in recent months. Now it is becoming clear that the ministry may again be a victim of a scandal.
It was reported last week that Nomura, the world's largest securities house, had discriminated against the majority of its customers by improperly paying a select group of big clients $120 million to compensate for their stock-trading losses. It was also reported that Nikko, Japan's third-largest securities house, had made $122 million in such payments.
The same big institutions that are widely believed to get other favorable treatment, like advance notice of the choicest stock tips, were also given guarantees that they would not lose money, a practice banned here and in most world markets because it discriminates against other investors, particularly individuals.
Nomura first issued indignant denials, only to reverse itself on Friday and acknowledge that it had made the payments, as did Nikko. It has since been reported that the other members of the Big Four securities houses, Daiwa Securities and Yamaichi Securities, provided smaller amounts of improper compensation to their top customers.
Hiroshi Okumura, an economics professor at Ryukoku University and a former researcher at a securities-industry supported research center, said such investment guarantees had been "an open secret" here for years.
Adding to the public concern were disclosures that Nomura and Nikko had each lent more than $100 million to one of Japan's best-known organized crime bosses, and then executed his orders in what appears to have been a share-manipulation scheme.
At 10 A.M. on Monday, a tearful but still defiant Yoshihisa Tabuchi, Nomura's formidable president, refused to confirm details of the scandal or even that Nomura had been responsible for any wrongdoing. He said he was resigning to take responsibility for the firm's having suffered some bad publicity. Every Nomura official who would discuss the shocking development described it as a noble act, rather than a show of penance.
 
A Shadow Play
 Two facts added to the sense that this was a symbolic shadow play. First, Mr. Tabuchi is not leaving the firm -- he said he was resigning as chief executive to become vice chairman without executive powers. Second, his annointed successor is the man closest to him at Nomura, Hideo Sakamaki, who had headed strategic planning.
Also on Monday, five and a half hours later, Takuya Iwasaki, Nikko's chief executive, read from the same script: he resigned the presidency to become vice chairman and was succeeded by his vice president, Kichiro Takao.
Nearly two years after the reported manipulation involving the organized-crime figure, the Tokyo Stock Exchange announced that it would investigate the transaction and Nomura's role in it.
"I can't believe there will be any real change," said Makoto Sataka, a business commentator here. "Those people were cornered. That's why they resigned. It's just a symbol."
He added, "Nothing changes anyway until the ministry changes, and they have said nothing to indicate they will do that."
Commented a securities industry executive: "The ministry has winked at this for a long time. But nobody resigned there, which tells you something."
Perhaps the most damaging admission was that the Finance Ministry's securities bureau had known of the improper compensation schemes since early last year but had taken no punitive measures; the scandal only came to light because tax authorities began to investigate.
Mitsuru Hasegawa, an official in the securities company division, confirmed reports that the brokers had voluntarily told the ministry of the compensation; yet he did not seek to punish them or make the information public.
To some here, the problem is that the ministry's securities and banking bureaus have long been regarded as advocates for their industries. In part, this is because after bureaucrats retire from public service, they are often hired by the industries they regulated. The process is called amakudari, or literally, descent from heaven.
"It's impossible to get evidence, but I cannot help but think that the relationship between the industry and the ministry is too close," said Professor Okumura. "With the prospect of amakudari, the bureaucrats are prohibited from acting strongly."

HEADLINE: Ho-Hum No More, Concrete Goes High-Tech

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD

 BODY:
QUIET advances in materials science, coupled with raw inventiveness, are turning the drab, ho-hum stuff known as concrete into a high-technology marvel that has far greater strength and durability than ever before and some surprising new properties, like flexibility.
Such materials are desirable for creating structures that bend rather than break in earthquakes. And with concretes up to 10 times stronger than ordinary, builders are making plans for needle-thin skyscrapers that would rise more than a third of a mile into the sky, towering over today's tallest buildings. 
 Perhaps the most important use of the new materials is concrete of greatly improved durability, which is seen as endowing all manner of roads, buildings, sewers and bridges with long lifetimes. For example, experts say, roads might last 50 or 60 years with few repairs instead of the 10 or 20 years typical for light maintenance.
The economic implications of greater durability are vast. Amid the crumbling of much of America's multitrillion-dollar infrastructure, a large part of which is concrete, increasing durability is viewed as an economic boon that would help make repairs and renovations far more cost-effective.
"These developments are going to be used extensively," said Dr. Sidney Diamond, a materials engineer at Purdue University who works on the new concretes. "The benefits are so apparent, even in simple measurements, that I think a high percentage of the new infrastructure will be affected."
Experts estimate that as much as a trillion dollars will have to be spent in the next two decades to improve and repair the parts of the nation's infrastructure built of concrete, making it one of the biggest financial challenges facing America into the next century.
"We can't do things the way we did the first time around," said Dr. J. Francis Young, an expert on concrete at the University of Illinois. "We've learned the hard way about some of the problems, by watching the Interstate highways fall apart. We don't want to repeat that kind of expensive experiment."
Not all the applications are so pedestrian. Exotic ones under study or accomplished include using concrete and cement to make boats, bottles, brake linings, electronic circuit boards, roof shingles, bottle caps, indoor furniture, engine blocks, loudspeaker cases and bases for computer chips.
For decades concrete fabrication was in the doldrums, beset by complacency and resistance to change. But as potholes, crumbling bridges and leaky water mains increasingly seized the nation's attention in the 1980's and as foreigners made strides in developing new concretes, often using ideas that originated in this country, a consensus formed that it was time for a fresh start.
In 1987, a report by a panel of the National Research Council, a scientific group based in Washington that advises the Federal Government, hailed the potential of new construction techniques and materials, including concrete, as a way to speed renewal and to battle decay. Its report, "Infrastructure for the 21st Century," cited "unprecedented opportunities" for innovation.
 
New Research Center
 One response to the promising developments in concrete came in February 1989 when the National Science Foundation, a main Government sponsor of basic research, founded the Center for Science and Technology of Advanced Cement-Based Materials at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill. The center is to receive $10 million over five years. This tiny investment has changed the field of concrete research, and could ultimately have implications for construction projects worth many hundreds of billions of dollars.
"The aim," said Dr. Surendra P. Shah, director of the center and a civil engineer at Northwestern, "is a new generation of materials."
The center, which finances research at Northwestern, the University of Illinois, the University of Michigan, Purdue University and the National Institute of Standards and Technology, instantly quadrupled the size of the field, with the number of scientists and graduate students investigating new kinds of concrete going to nearly 100 from about 25. New tools of the trade include laser holograms and electron microscopes, which are used to analyze tiny fractures, and nuclear magnetic resonance for probing deeper structure.
The subject of the investigations is complex and versatile. Concrete is a mixture of water, sand, gravel and a binder, usually portland cement, which is made of powdered limestone and clay. It is extremely plastic and easy to manipulate when wet, and it hardens to a stone-like condition when dry. Tough and cheap, concrete is used everywhere and has been for more than a century.
Experts sometimes refer to concrete as a kind of ceramic. But differences between the two materials reveal one of concrete's basic advantages. Ceramic materials, made mainly of clay, must be fired to high temperatures to achieve hardness. That is costly. In contrast, most concretes are produced by chemical reactions at room temperature, making their manufacture relatively cheap and far less cumbersome.
 
A Major Drawback
 One of the main problems with concrete is its porous structure, which is not detectable by the naked eye but is apparent under a microscope. A welter of tiny voids, up to a hundred times finer than a human hair, are left behind after water chemically joins with cement.
These tiny spaces can be the beginnings of fractures. In addition, water that pools on hardened cement can gather in these pores and fractures and then trickle into the concrete's interior. When frozen, the water expands and can cause the cement to burst apart. Water can also carry a host of damaging chemicals, like the corrosive chlorides of de-icing salts.
Over the years, a number of inventors have tried to eliminate concrete's pores and have had growing success. Organic or carbon-based compounds called super plasticizers have cut down on concrete's water content without reducing its fluid nature when wet.
As a result, the porous structure is finer. "Big pores cease to exist," Dr. Diamond explained, "and the total structure is more homogeneous. It's intrinsically stronger and less prone to corrosion. And the durability is better."
The aim of pore elimination has been furthered by the addition of mineral compounds like extremely fine silica, a hard glassy material that fills many of the remaining voids.
"The resulting concrete is almost as strong as you want, depending on the dosage of additives and the care you invest," Dr. Diamond said. He noted that concrete's compressive strength can be raised from 3,000 to at least 20,000 pounds per square inch, making it exceedingly good at holding heavy loads.
 
A Super-Slim Tower
 High-strength concretes are being used by developers and architects to build not only longer-lasting structures but entirely new kinds of structures. Two Chicago developers, Lee Miglin and J. Paul Beitler, are planning a slender, 2,000-foot-high tower that uses nothing but reinforced concrete for its vertical support. The slender structure is to soar past the Sears Tower, which at 1,454 feet is the world's tallest building.
A hurdle for the planned building was passed in April when the Federal Aviation Administration approved the design, finding that it posed no danger to air traffic.
The building, designed by Cesar Pelli & Associates, makes extensive use of high-strength concretes that can withstand stresses of as much as 14,000 pounds per square inch, much higher than usual.
High-strength mixes are also being used increasingly in more common structures, giving them longer lifetimes.
"It has been quite common to see significant distress in parking garages or bridge decks, due to salt, within a decade," said Lawrence R. Roberts, director of technical services for the construction products division of W. R. Grace & Company, based in Cambridge, Mass. "The people who are currently doing the design work are now expecting services of 40 or 50 years or more."
A startling new property for concrete is flexibility. Concrete can support great weight but has low tensile strength, meaning it cracks or breaks when stretched. That is why concrete is often reinforced with steel bars, which have great tensile strength.
To make concrete hundreds of times more flexible, researchers at Northwestern are adding long, thin fibers of steel, glass and plastic until they make up 10 to 20 percent of the concrete. The fibers prevent minor cracks from enlarging, tying them together in an elastic matrix.
To show the flexibility, Dr. Shah of Northwestern keeps on his desk a strip of concrete that he bends like a plastic ruler for visitors. A goal of the research is to explore the possibility of using elastic concrete to make buildings, roads and bridges that would bend, not break, in earthquakes.
At the leading edge of concrete research is an odd, hybrid material known as macro-defect-free cement, which is loaded with polymers like polyvinyl alcohol. Polymers are long chained molecules, including natural ones like proteins and synthetic ones like nylon. Artificial polymers give macro-defect-free cement the remarkable quality of being virtually pore free, endowing it with amazing strength and exotic qualities.
While relatively costly compared with bulk concrete, it is, for example, a very good electrical insulator, leading center researchers to explore its use for low-cost printed circuit boards, the grids that tie together tiny electronic parts. With further refinement, it may become a cheap replacement for plastics and aluminum, opening up a range of potential uses. Easily extruded from mixing machines into precise shapes, it could be formed into bottles, razor-blade handles or loudspeaker cabinets.
 
Support From Industry
 The range of potential uses for the new concretes and cements is reflected in the list of industrial partners of the foundation's center; the list includes W. R. Grace; Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing , a materials concern; and the Gillette Company, which makes shaving products.
Much exploration of the foundation's aims at trying to predict with great precision the capabilities of the new materials, in particular, how long they will last. To do this, researchers are probing deeply into molecular and atomic structure.
"We have lots of strategies," said Dr. Young of the University of Illinois. "But we don't always know how well they work. You've got to understand this stuff from the bottom up. That's going to become critically important as we start to reconstruct and rehabilitate the nation's infrastructure."

HEADLINE: ON HORSE RACING;
Intertrack 'Craze' Lands in Florida

BYLINE: By Joseph Durso

 BODY:
The biggest race in horse racing these days is the race for business.
And since the business of racing is primarily the business of betting, the race is on to find new ways to reach you and your betting money before you spend it someplace else, most likely on a lottery or in some casino in Atlantic City or Las Vegas, Nev. 
 In Florida, for example, people who go to the dog track now can sit there in front of a television screen and bet on horses running at a thoroughbred track someplace else.
And people at a jai alai fronton in Fort Lauderdale can bet on a horse race in Hallandale. Crazy? Maybe. But a lot of things in the economics of sports are crazy these days, and some of them work.
Of course, you can always still go to the race track and bet on a horse you happen to be watching. But that's the old-fashioned way of betting. And because fewer people seem to be doing it, "intertrack wagering" has been born.
This type of wagering is known in the board rooms of the business as I.T.W., and it's the hottest thing in racing -- maybe even the secret weapon of racing. It's being tried in several states on a limited basis, and it's being tried for the first time this year in Florida.
"It's just the tip of the iceberg," Douglas Donn, president of Gulfstream Park, said by telephone from his office the other day. "Like many states, we're starting to emerge into new ways to market our product, and intertrack wagering is one of the ways we're doing it. But it's not the whole answer. There are more ways, and better ways. But offtrack betting and intertrack betting may be what we need to expand ontrack betting.
"Every state is struggling with the economics of racing. The bottom line is: We've got to market our product to a much wider audience. I don't know how it shakes out. But nationally we've got to expand our market or we all get hurt."
Donn's track held the fort this year, despite a downward trend in racing plus the impact of the recession and the war in the Persian Gulf. The tourist season was slow, but Gulfstream Park managed to run 88 days of racing with an average daily attendance of 10,866 spectators and an average betting handle of $1.7 million. The attendance was up 1 percent from 1990, the handle was down about 5 1/2 percent.
But the numbers grow if you add the I.T.W. factor: the people who bet on the horses even when they are going to the dogs, so to speak.
This is called "total attendance," meaning people who attend the races plus those who go someplace else but still bet money into the track's parimutuel system through intertrack wagering; they didn't make the scene, but their money did. There were 1,593 of them on the average afternoon at Gulfstream, and they bet an average of $217,933.
At the current meeting at the Calder track in Miami, the numbers are even rounder: About $550,000 a day is being pumped into the track's parimutuel system from other places, and that's half the amount being wagered inside the track.
"It works in Florida," Donn said, "because there are 12 million people spread around the state. We have maybe 4 million in our market and the 8 million others are outside it. We have to market our product to them."
"In the short term," said John J. Brunetti, the owner of Hialeah Park, "offtrack betting in its various forms will be beneficial. In the long term, it's going to make couch potatoes out of everybody. We still don't market our sport nationally. We're the oldest American sport, and we do nothing to promote it."
Hialeah, once the comeliest track in the land, hasn't contributed to the crazy economics of racing since 1989, when it got into a shooting war with the other tracks in South Florida and tried to operate head-to-head with Calder. It was all part of a longtime vendetta over who should be allowed to race during the peak of the winter tourist season. Hialeah drew only 4,114 fans on opening day, and struck out.
Last year, Hialeah stayed shut while Brunetti went campaigning for a better piece of the action. He eventually got it when the Florida Legislature authorized a season of 50 dates this year for Hialeah, which will reopen Nov. 10 and run through Jan. 7. Then, Gulfstream will hold center stage until March 15.
Next year?
"The solution," Donn suggested, "is for the state to buy Hialeah."
"It's not for sale," Brunetti replied.
You get the feeling that Florida racing is on the brink of something. But they should call a truce in the intertrack warring of the past and focus instead on intertrack wagering and all those other new systems, and find out if they can save the sport of kings for us common people.

Dominance Dwindles For Mets' Pitchers

BYLINE: By JOE SEXTON

 BODY:
Pitching. Lots of pitching. Lots of good young pitching. For the Mets, it's long been their operating philosophy and strategic premise for success in the National League East.
Too much pitching. Too deep to be hurt badly by injury. Too talented to ever be counted out of the race. For the rest of the division, that's been the conventional wisdom in sizing up the Mets. 
 Consider:
Dwight Gooden, 26 years old, record of 7-5, 1991 earned run average of 3.88; Frank Viola, 31, 2,200 innings pitched, record of 7-5, 1991 earned run average of 2.96; Ron Darling, 30, 25-28 record over last three seasons, 1991 earned run average of 3.92; John Franco, 30, 1-6 record, bad back.
"I don't think you can say we've had dominant pitching this season," said Al Harazin, the executive vice president of the Mets. "But we're spoiled because we're used to having it. It's not been subpar. It's just not the kind we've enjoyed."
Indeed, the pitching for the Mets, routinely, almost robotically referred to as the best in baseball for years, qualified as of yesterday as only fourth best in the National League behind the Dodgers, the Pirates and the Braves. And fourth is where the Mets finished in team pitching in 1990 when they had only the third best outfit in their own division.
 
Opportunity Is There
 "Have we performed as the best starting staff?" Viola asked. "No. But we have, the majority of the time, given our team a chance to win."
Perhaps. But the 35-32 Mets have barely won a majority of those games. Gooden, Viola and David Cone, considered and paid as among the top pitchers in baseball, are a combined 20-15 as the season approaches its halfway mark. As well, not one member of the rotation rates in the league's top 10 for earned run averages.
The figures are no more inspiring when broken down individually.
Gooden, whose 3.83 e.r.a. last season was the highest of his career, has been scored on with greater frequency and more ferocity this season, lit up for five or more earned runs in five of his last seven starts. In a game last Thursday he gave up three home runs for the first time ever.
Viola, whose 2.96 e.r.a. is the highest it's been in nearly a year and a half, has won once in his last five starts, having blown leads in four of them. He has given up 112 hits in 109 1/3 innings as opponents have hit .269 against him. And this from a pitcher who is a career 77-46 before the All-Star Game break and 60-64 after it.
"After last year's second half," said Viola, who lost three critical games down the September stretch in 1990, "I have a lot to prove."
Anyone and everyone can be forgiven for having a lot to ask about Franco's season. While his bad back contributed directly to the recent incredible inflation of his earned run average and further deterioration of his record, Franco has all along given up an abundance of hits and allowed an unhealthy number of walks. As a result, opponents have hit .293 against him, amassing 29 hits in 22 2/3 innings.
"There is no other way to look at it other than to say we've struggled with our pitching," said Rick Cerone, the veteran catcher who has worked more games and seen more pitches than any other on the team. "But there's this way to look at it as a result: Doc has struggled; Frank has struggled; John has struggled, and we're not out of anything yet."
The Mets, however, are not exactly in the thick of anything yet, either, stuck for weeks roughly half a dozen games behind the Pirates.
And so while it may be true, as players and prognosticators said before the season, that the makeup of their pitching has prevented the Mets from suffering a prolonged losing streak, it is equally as true that the essential mediocrity of the pitching over all has precluded a long string of triumphs.
The ostensibly deadly combination of Gooden and Viola, for instance, hasn't put together consecutive triumphs since mid-May. Not surprisingly, the Mets haven't won more than four games in a row or as many as two consecutive series since then, either.
There is, as well, something almost humorous in the current clubhouse cliche that Sid Fernandez's return stands to have a great impact. Fernandez, after all, is the left-hander who can be brilliant or baffled, but who most consistently finds ways to lose.
Fernandez, 9-14 last season, is the sensitive soul who is going to be hard-pressed to overcome his own doubts after breaking his arm in spring training much less overwhelm opposing lineups.
Further, the bullpen, with Franco's future health in doubt, Alejandro Pena's right shoulder chronically in question and rookies regularly in position to determine results, is in a shambles.
"I don't think," said Harazin, "that after two and a half months you can panic."
Maybe, though, it's time to rethink this notion that the pitching is too good for the Mets not to be taken seriously.

HEADLINE: New York's Film Office May Suffer Sharp Cuts

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS

 BODY:
A proposal by the New York City Council to make severe cuts in the Mayor's Office for Film, Theater and Broadcast has provoked a chorus of criticism from those in the city's film industry, and in the mayoral and police bureaucracy as well.
On Friday, as part of efforts to close the city's $3.5 billion budget gap, the Council proposed that the $450,000 operating budget of the film office be cut to $250,000; that 5 of the office's 10 staff members be laid off, and that the issuance of film permits be transferred to the New York Police Department. 
 Neither the Mayor nor the Council has released details of the Council's plan, but senior mayoral aides said that the film office proposal was part of the Council's proposal for $476 million more in service cuts than the Mayor has suggested, in an attempt to stave off higher taxes.
"Yes, we're looking at possible cuts in all agencies, but we can't confirm these cuts specifically," a City Council spokesman, Michael S. Clendenin, said about reducing the size of the film office.
 
Council Has the Power
 The Council proposals are a matter of intense negotiation at this point, and in suggesting such cuts the Council did not order them. But by law the Mayor does not have the power to veto spending cuts made by the Council.
Last year, the film office issued 7,100 permits to production teams shooting feature films, television programs, documentaries and commercials in the city. The permits are required for the use of city streets and all city property and equipment.
"To save $200,000, it doesn't make sense to jeopardize a whole industry," said Jaynne C. Keyes, director of the Mayor's film office. "Show me another agency that brings in the kind of returns that we do for our little budget."
New York's film industry, a vital part of the city's economy that is estimated to generate from $500 million to $2.3 billion in business as well as an abundance of ancillary jobs, is still recovering from a bitter stalemate between Hollywood producers and New York film unions that virtually shut down major-studio film making in New York City from last November to mid-May.
Ms. Keyes said that film activity after the boycott "had just begun to pick up." Currently shooting in New York is "Light Sleeper," with Susan Sarandon and Willem Dafoe, and expected this summer are "Glengarry Glen Ross," with Al Pacino, Alec Baldwin and Jack Lemmon; "The Pickle," a film written and directed by Paul Mazursky, as well as the new projects of the film makers Sidney Lumet and Martin Bregman.
 
A Producer Objects
 "The one thing that makes New York attractive for film makers is the one-stop shopping for the permit, and the cooperation that the city gives film makers," said Jeffrey Hayes, co-producer of the NBC television show "Law and Order," which has shot in New York for two years.
"If the Police Department handles the street permits, it will be very difficult for us to work here," he said. "We'd keep colliding with the bureaucracy."
Joseph P. Wuensch, the deputy commissioner for management and budget of the New York Police Department, said of permit-issuing that "we can't do it."
He added: "We just sustained a loss of 626 civilians, and we cannot absorb this kind of new function. We know nothing about the film industry, and the permits would be extraordinarily difficult for us to deal with."
The Mayor's office opposes the Council's proposed cuts as well. "Hopefully by the time we get through our discussion, the City Council will see the light and realize that this is not a very smart thing to do to an industry that we came close to losing," said Jeanne Nathan, a spokeswoman in the office of Sally B. Hernandez-Pinero, Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS PEOPLE;
Highland Superstores To Cut Management

BYLINE: By ISADORE BARMASH

 BODY:
In its latest effort to cut expenses, Highland Superstores, the financially pressured chain of electronics and appliance stores, said yesterday that it was eliminating five vice presidential positions and that Yale Levin, its chief operating officer, was resigning.
The company, based in Plymouth, Mich., said the management reduction reflected a recent curtailing of its operations and an overall expense-cutting program. Early this month, the company, one of the country's largest electronic chains, said that it had ceased paying creditors and was closing 32 stores in Texas, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Rhode Island to avoid a bankruptcy court filing. 
 The company's statement yesterday said only that Mr. Levin, 50, would join an unidentifed private company in Detroit and that he would remain a Highland director. Ira Mondry, Highland's president and chief executive officer, will assume Mr. Levin's duties as chief operating officer, and John Brownson, vice president and controller, will succeed Mr. Levin as chief financial officer. Mr. Mondry did not return telephone calls yesterday to his Plymouth office.
Like other regional electronics retailers, Highland's growth in recent years has been stunted, as consumers have pulled back on big-ticket purchases, as they often do in a recession.
In December, after reporting losses from the 92 stores it had then, Highland said it had retained Lehman Brothers to seek a buyer or merger partner. Also in December, Highland reported reaching agreement with its banks to defer half its $22 million in short-term debt payments. Total debt amounts to $52 million.
The company lost $11.8 million in the fiscal year ended Jan. 31 on sales of $861 million. The year before, Highland lost $12.4 million on sales of $924.6 million. In the first quarter ended April 30, Highland had a sharply higher loss of $90.2 million, compared with a net loss of $6.7 million the year before.
In its statement yesterday, Highland said David Mondry, Ira's father who is a former company chairman and president and who remains on the board, will return as a full-time vice chairman. The vice presidents whose jobs have been eliminated were in charge of regions, and one was responsible for human relations, Highland said. An associate said that Mr. Levin was not available for comment.
One of the oldest of the appliance store discounters, Highland was founded in 1933 by Harry Mondry. Under his two sons, Eugene and David, the company's sales eventually reached almost $1 billion. But after sales began to suffer in the late 1980's with markets saturated for videocassette recorders and microwave ovens, Highland entered into a prolonged period of losses.

HEADLINE: Reduce New York Taxes and Restructure the State Government

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I am responding to "New York's Ordeal: The Tax Exit" (editorial, June 13) on behalf of a 20,000-member public policy organization. 
 New Yorkers carry one of the country's heaviest tax burdens. State and local per capita taxes are the second highest among the 50 states. New York has the fifth highest property taxes, the sixth highest sales taxes and the eighth highest corporate income taxes. New York's taxes have grown faster than those of any other state in the Union.
This year the average New Yorker will have worked 146 days -- from Jan. 1 to May 26 -- to satisfy all Federal, state and local tax collectors. The Tax Foundation ranks New York as having the highest tax burden in the country and shows that New Yorkers surrender an astonishing 40 percent of income to taxes.
These calculations spotlight the ever-increasing state and local tax burdens of New York taxpayers. From 1983 to 1989, the New York taxpayer's burden averaged 31 percent higher than the national average, rising from $916 per individual in 1983 to $1,481 in 1989.
In 1989, New York ranked third in state and local spending combined, a full 47 percent higher than the national average.
Furthermore, since 1983, state spending has risen almost three times as fast as the rate of inflation. From 1983 to 1990, inflation was 35 percent, and spending growth was 97 percent. Clearly, spending restraint, not tax increases, is the answer to New York's budget woes.
For the third year in a row, New Yorkers have had their taxes raised more than $1 billion, including last year's increase of $1.8 billion -- the largest in the state's history.
The only true road to fiscal responsibility is to reduce taxes and restructure government, thus eliminating waste.

HEADLINE: Reduce New York Taxes and Restructure the State Government;
How to Raise Revenue

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"New York's Ordeal: The Tax Exit" (editorial, June 13) will be welcomed by working people throughout New York State. Last March, the New York State A.F.L.-C.I.O. released a report, "Taxes We Can Live With," that made the same point. Our study of taxation, produced by an independent economist, concluded that the way out of the fiscal crisis was to increase revenue by making the tax system more progressive and elastic, chiefly the personal income tax. 
 It did my heart good to see you reject the crude argument that we can't raise taxes because business will flee. As you observe, this is a one-sided view of the way in which business makes location decisions. New York State has some room to raise taxes without damaging its competitive position.
Finally, you are correct to point out that long-run structural problems affect the state tax system. The system is inelastic. Tax revenue growth does not keep pace with economic growth, hence recurring, widening deficits. Resorting to borrowing, one-shot gimmicks, such as selling Aqueduct Race Track, harassing motorists with surcharges on parking tickets and imposing regressive taxes on energy products, has put us deeper into the hole.

HEADLINE: Dow Drops By 52.55, To 2,913.01

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
Stock prices plunged yesterday, as the market was buffeted by an unusual combination of a Japanese brokerage scandal and signs of a worsening domestic economy underscored by declining corporate earnings.
 A reduction in the earnings estimates of analysts for several technology companies also weighed on the market, as did a weaker dollar in the face of a stronger German mark and British pound. 
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 52.55 points, or 1.77 percent, to 2,913.01. But there was no panic selling, as volume on the New York Stock Exchange shrank to 138 million shares, from 194.6 million on Friday. Still, only 308 Big Board issues closed with gains, while 1,331 posted losess.
 
Heavy Selling in Japan
 The Japanese scandal centers on charges that top brokerage houses guaranteed to repay part or all the investment losses of big clients. The unfolding scandal led to heavy selling on the Japanese stock exchanges and fears that Japanese investors would unload portfolios of largely blue-chip stocks later in London and New York.
 In the wake of the Japanese brokerage scandal, troubling questions remain about Tokyo's financial markets. [News analysis, page D9.]
 Computerized trading programs tended to add momentum to yesterday's decline in New York until 3:48 P.M., or 12 minutes before Big Board trading ends, when the Dow had lost 50 points. Under the exchange's rules, all computer programs must cease when the Dow falls or rises 50 points.
 
Net Program Loss of 19.69
 Birinyi Associates, which tracks program trading, found only one buy and three sell programs during the day, the net result was a decline of 19.69 points on the Dow. In all, the programs lasted a total of 52 minutes, much of it late in the session when the sell programs were in operation.
 "While both London and New York were depressed, neither market saw any panic selling, or in fact any significant selling by Japanese portfolio managers," said Robert H. Stovall, president of Stovall-21st Advisers. "What we did see was a continued flow of poor company earnings and lowering of projected profits, particularly in the already weakened software and technology sectors. Weak commodity prices also tell us that an economic recovery is not yet in sight."
 Given the low volume, Mr. Stovall continued, it was apparent that more investors moved to the sidelines than were motivated to sell. But those who did sell often found somewhat wider price movements than usual, which is common in days of light volume.
 Partly as a result, the Standard & Poor's index of 500 largely blue-chip issues closed down 6.81 points, to 370.94. The new S.& P. index of 400 middle-capitalized stocks dropped 2.43 points, to 120.92. The much broader Big Board composite index fell 3.37 points, to 203.50.
 Typical of the blue chips that were battered yesterday was I.B.M., which fell 1 1/4, to 98 3/8, and was the Big Board's second-most-active issue on a volume of 2.3 million shares.
 Other losers among the more active issues was General Motors, down 2 7/8, to 41 1/4; Ford Motor, off 1 1/8, to 36 5/8, and Chrysler, which slipped 1/8, to 13 3/4. Waste Management fell 1 1/8, to 36 1/2, and was the fifth most-active issue with 1.5 million shares traded.
 The only gainer on the Big Board's list of the 10 most-active issues was Columbia Gas Systems, which was ravaged last week after its management omitted a divend payment and said it was contemplating bankruptcy. Columbia Gas rose 1, to 18 1/8, and placed fourth in volume with 1.7 million shares traded.
 Among some popular issues that showed declines because of reduced earnings estimates were Motorola, down 1 3/8, to 64 5/8; Tandy, off 1 3/8, to 27 3/4; Lubrizol, down 5 7/8, to 44, on a turnover of 760,000 shares, and Burlington Northern, which lost 3, to 28 7/8. Technology Stocks Depressed
 But the most depressed sector of the market remained the computer, semiconductor and technology stocks. Some fell victim to lowered earnings estimates by analysts and some admitted to having problems filling and shiping orders.
 Those issues weighed down the Nasdaq composite index in particular, because it includes many semiconductor and technology stocks. The index closed down 10.59 points, to 475.23.
 Among the largest losers in the group were Sun Microsystems, down 4 1/8, to 25 1/2; Microsoft, off 4 1/8, to 98 1/8; Control Data, off 1 3/8, to 9 1/2; Intel, down 3 1/4, to 43 3/4, and International Rectifier, off 1 1/4, to 14 1/4.

Tokyo Stocks Rebound

 TOKYO, Tuesday, June 25 (Reuters) -- Stock prices jumped near the close of trading today on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, as investors sought bargains when no new stock-scandal developments were reported. Although he Nikkei index of 225 issues was down 178.90 points at midday, it surged back to gain 141.96, or six-tenths of a percent, and close at 23,907.42. It lost 509.62 on Monday.

HEADLINE: Quiet Czech Triumph: Russians Out

BYLINE: By HENRY KAMM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PRAGUE, June 25

 BODY:
In a modest ceremony at the Foreign Ministry, a milestone in Czechoslovak history was reached today. Lieut. Gen. Eduard Vorobyov, commander of Soviet forces, and Lieut. Gen. Rudolf Duchacek of the Czechoslovak Army signed a protocol ending 23 years of Soviet military occupation.
The last units of the army that arrived as invaders in 1968 left last week. Only a rock concert on Monday night marked the event; it was attended mainly by people who were not yet born in 1968. 
 The Government issued no declaration. "All these things are so dead now, there's no use to talk of them very much," Foreign Minister Jiri Dienstbier said in an interview.
Despite this ostentatiously cool attitude, President Vaclav Havel's leadership has from the beginning made the departure of the Soviet Army a top priority. The leaders regard it as much more than a military or diplomatic goal; they see it as the restoration of national sovereignty.
For Czechoslovaks, the presence of Soviet troops was not, as it was for their Polish, Hungarian and East German neighbors, a fact of life resulting from their being liberated from Nazi rule by the Soviet Army in 1944-45. The liberating troops, Soviet and American, left Czechoslovakia at the end of World War II.

 Soviet armies did not return until Aug. 21, 1968, when they and the armies of four Warsaw Pact allies invaded to crush the liberalization of the "Prague Spring." The Soviet troops served until now as symbol of the force that reversed the will of the nation and subjected it to physical foreign domination.
"It was a task we set for ourselves as the beginning of the restoration of our national sovereignty," said Defense Minister Lubos Dobrovsky, who, as Deputy Foreign Minister shortly after the overthrow of the Communist dictatorship in November 1989 and in his present post, was the chief architect of the withdrawal.
Mr. Havel placed this mission at the top of the agenda when he assumed the presidency after the revolution that he led, Mr. Dobrovsky said in an interview in his modest apartment in a public housing project at the edge of the city.
"At the beginning of 1990 he formed a group with the task of persuading the Russians to negotiate," he said. By February, that was achieved.
Just as Mr. Havel changed almost overnight from being the most persecuted and imprisoned opponent into the leader of the nation, so did Mr. Dobrovsky become a figure of poetic justice as he negotiated the Soviet Army withdrawal.
When the invasion occurred, he was in Moscow as the Prague radio's correspondent, serving from what had become the enemy capital as a voice of Czechoslovak protest. Information that he was no longer free to broadcast he passed to an American friend to bring to the attention of the world.
In October 1968, Moscow expelled him, and his last contact with the Soviet Union before arriving there 21 years later as principal negotiator was five hours of harassment and search at the border crossing.
"The negotiations were extremely difficult," the minister said. "From the very beginning we had to persuade them to accept our basic position. It was that we were not equal partners. You are occupiers; you have to leave, and you shall also bear the political, moral and material costs of the invasion."
"There were moments that were very tense," Mr. Dobrovsky continued. Czechoslovak diplomacy was restricted by the fact that Mr. Dobrovsky and his associates could not push so hard as to make the Russians walk out, a possibility that he said might have delayed the withdrawal by a decade. Also, he said, there was always a suggestion that Moscow might apply economic pressures. Czechoslovak industry depends on Soviet energy and raw materials.
 
The Turning Point
 At a crucial point, Mr. Dobrovsky said, when the talks in Moscow seemed deadlocked, he proposed an exchange of letters between President Havel and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev "to calm the negotiations." This provided the turning point, he continued, and by spring of last year the rapid withdrawal of the 70,000 soldiers was agreed on.
The minister said the negotiations ran parallel with talks to liquidate the military structure of the Warsaw Pact, an event that took place this year.
"On this protocol there is my signature as Defense Minister," Mr. Dobrovsky said. "I am not very often emotional at such events, but signing this I felt enormous satisfaction. I felt that at that moment the sovereignty of Czechoslovakia as an independent state was fully restored."
Mr. Dobrovsky paid tribute to Eduard A. Shevardnadze, the former Soviet Foreign Minister. "Without his deep understanding for our efforts, the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact and the withdrawal of Soviet troops would have been much more complicated," he said. "Certain political forces in the Soviet Union cannot forgive Shevardnadze for this."
 
No Sense of Revenge
 Mr. Dienstbier, another former journalist, who served four years in prison as a dissident, said he and Mr. Shevardnadze reached a compromise under which Prague gave Moscow up to 18 months to leave rather than one year.
Other than admitting to a moment of emotion at signing the Warsaw Pact into oblivion, the 59-year-old Mr. Dobrovsky said he felt no personal gratification or sense of revenge at his reversal of fortune. His appointment to high office followed 21 years spent as a window washer, boiler-room stoker and victim of political persecution.
"All I lived through was the normal continuity of life," he said. "The fact that I was once a journalist is as fortuitous as that I later became a window washer and am now Defense Minister."
In a response that marks a widespread sentiment among leaders of the former dissident movement, Mr. Dobrovsky rejected special credit for his role in 21 years of illegal opposition.
"It is always misleading when one sees actions of dissent as other than personal actions," he said. "All I did in dissent I did to preserve my own self. If my activities had a side effect, a secondary result that led to conditions to make possible the overthrow of the regime, so much the better. But this was not the principal aim of our activity."
On the contrary, the minister accepted for himself and other dissenters a share of the blame for the years of Soviet domination. "We let it be done to us all too easily," he said.

Car Wars: More Bad News

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
HAVE you driven a Ford (or a Chrysler or a G.M. car) lately? As Detroit learned in the 1980's, a customer lost to Japanese car makers is often lost for good.
But according to Fred Mannering and Clifford Winston, that is only the beginning of the bad news, not the end. American auto companies may finally be making cars that are attractive to owners of foreign cars. But the gap in brand loyalty between American and Japanese makes, the researchers conclude, virtually guarantees that the Detroit auto makers will continue to lose sales to their Japanese rivals. 
 The Mannering-Winston analysis, published last week in the Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, is likely to impress professional number crunchers. The big question is whether it will make any waves in the Motor City, which has yet to design a successful defense against the invasion of the Japanese customer snatchers.
In a perfect world, shoppers could ferret out everything they wanted to know about a car before signing on the dotted line. Brand loyalty would not exist because more tangible predictors of quality and reliability would always be available: The year G.M. came out with a better sporty subcompact, customers would beat a path to its door.
But in the real world, solid information is scarce and the choices are bewilderingly profuse. Every car buyer worries that his love affair with those alluring new wheels on the showroom floor will end in bitterness and betrayal. Brands thus serve as a surrogate for what cannot easily be measured: If the aging Camry in the garage delivered the goods, it is only prudent to test-drive another.
Mr. Mannering and Mr. Winston used statistical techniques to isolate brand loyalty from the other factors that determined car purchases over the last two decades for a sample of some 500 households. All six companies with sufficient sales to generate statistically reliable data (General Motors, Ford Motor, Chrysler, Nissan, Honda and Toyota) did engender some degree of brand loyalty. But the differences among makes and the changes in loyalty over time were striking.
Before 1980, loyalty to American and Japanese brands was roughly the same. Holding other factors constant, the owner of a Toyota or a Honda or G.M. car was roughly seven percentage points more likely to buy another than a person lacking experience with the brand. If, for example, G.M. had 35 percent of the market, 42 percent of all owners of G.M. cars could be expected to make a repeat purchase.
But after 1980, loyalty rates diverged. Honda's, Toyota's and Nissan's loyalty edge grew to 14 percentage points, while Ford's and G.M.'s slipped to just 3. And with more owners of Japanese cars sticking by their brands, Japan's share of the market naturally tended to rise.
Brand loyalty is not, of course, the only factor influencing car choices. The Mannering-Winston analysis suggests that Detroit could have kept its share of the market simply by holding down prices. In the one case where Toyota and G.M. split the output of identical cars that the two companies jointly produced in California, G.M. was able to unload its half by underpricing Toyota by $1,600 a car.
But buying market share is an expensive option, one that Detroit has generally been loathe to take. Mr. Mannering and Mr. Winston calculate that the divergence in brand loyalty cost the Big Three roughly 7.2 million car sales over the 1980's. If this gap does not narrow, the researchers estimate that Detroit's 73.5 percent share of the market in 1989 will erode to 62.7 percent by 1999.
The obvious point here -- a point that has become the mantra of business school babble -- is that attention to quality and service pays off. But Mr. Mannering and Mr. Winston suggest some subtler lessons:
*It was probably not in Detroit's long-term interest to match Japanese price increases in the late 1980's. The increases certainly assured big profits for the Big Three and big bonuses for management. But exceptionally high levels of brand loyalty to Japanese cars will make it hard to woo back customers lost during these years.
*Producing good cars is not always enough. To get the most out of hard-earned good will, product lines must evolve with their markets. Honda, for example, has capitalized on the success of the Accord by building bigger, plusher models to match the family sizes, waistlines and buying power of its aging loyalists. The 1991 Ford Taurus, by contrast, is virtually the same as the 1985 version.
*Since brand loyalty is really a soft substitute for hard information, the best strategy for offsetting the loyalty factor is getting more, credible information to customers. One radical approach to that end would be to encourage Washington to collect and disseminate data on vehicle reliability, repair costs and customer satisfaction.
All this assumes, of course, that American cars are now competitive on the merits. If you don't have it, there is no point in flaunting it.

Dollar Ends Mostly Higher After Durable-Goods Report

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar closed mostly higher yesterday after the Government reported that orders for durable goods were showing more strength than had been expected.
Gold prices also advanced. In New York, gold rose $1.60 to $364.60 an ounce on the Commodity Exchange. The Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of $364.25, up $1.05.
The Commerce Department said durable goods orders rose 3.8 percent in May, the largest gain in more than a year.
The report was considered further evidence of a strengthening economy. An improving economy raises the prospects for higher interest rates, which support the dollar by increasing demand for American investments. The dollar tends to rise on good economic news.
But Kevin Logan, chief economist with the Swiss Bank Corporation in New York, said the dollar's gains were limited, in part because "the recovery idea is already built into the market."
"What the market would need to advance," he said, "is stronger news."
 
Pound Drops
 The British pound fell against the dollar, closing at $1.6310 in New York, down from $1.6470 late Friday. In earlier London trading, sterling fell to $1.6280, from $1.6425 late Monday.
But the dollar fell against the Japanese yen. Mr. Logan said the yen was helped by a Japanese news report that said the monetary officials of the Group of Seven industrialized nations had agreed to intervene in currency markets if the dollar rose to 140 yen.
The dollar fell to 138.30 yen in New York from 138.70 yen late Monday. In Tokyo overnight, long before the report crossed news tickers, the dollar fell 1.39 yen, to 138.38 yen. In London, it was quoted at 138.75 yen.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's quotes, included: 1.7935 German marks, up from 1.7830; 1.5498 Swiss francs, up from 1.5345; 6.0890 French francs, up from 6.0545; 1,336.00 Italian lire, up from 1,326.00, and 1.14195 Canadian dollars, down from 1.14255.
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Monday, included: 1.7965 German marks, up from 1.7845; 1.5525 Swiss francs, up from 1.5335; 6.0980 French francs, up from 6.0595; 1,337.25 Italian lire, up from 1,328.00, and 1.1419 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1427.
In early trading in London, gold rose to a late bid of $364.20, from $361.20 late Monday. In Zurich, the metal rose to a closing bid of $363.50, from $361.00. In Hong Kong, gold fell $2.29, to close at a bid of $363.63.

HEADLINE: Bank Funds And C.D.'s Off Slightly

 BODY:
Yields on certificates of deposits and money market accounts continued their slide in the week ended yesterday.
But the Bank Rate Monitor, an interest rate publication based in North Palm Beach, Fla., predicts the numbers will probably remain stable for a while. 
 "The story is that we are now at the bottom of a 26-month down cycle in interest rates," said Robert K. Heady, publisher of the trade publication. "Investors can expect to see the numbers remain flat for some time because of the weak economy."
Money market accounts at New York area banks and savings institutions averaged 5.35 percent, he said. At commercial banks the average was 5.14 percent and at the savings institutions 5.56 percent. In each case the yields fell 1 basis point. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
The yield on Manufacturers Hanover's three-month and six-month certificates had the largest yield change among commercial banks, dropping 11 basis points, to 5.60 percent and 5.65 percent, respectively.

GRAPHIC: Chart: 'Bank Money Accounts'
 
Annual effective yields, in percent, on money market accounts, three-month certificates of deposit and six-month C.D.'s expected at selected institutions on Wednesday, June 26, 1991. Some C.D. yields assume reinvestment after maturity. Yields are based on the method of compounding and the rate stated for the lowest minimum to open an account, but minimums may vary. Higher yields may be offered for larger deposits. C.D. figures are for fixed rates only.

HEADLINE: Durables Orders Up 3.8% in May

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 25

 BODY:
New orders for manufactured durable goods rose 3.8 percent in May, the second straight sizable increase and the biggest in more than a year, the Commerce Department reported today.
The rise, combined with other figures released today on home sales, consumer confidence and auto sales, added significantly to evidence that the economy is climbing out of recession. The report also dispelled doubts raised by recent data on unemployment claims and machine tool orders. 
 "I think the economy has turned around," said Carl J. Palash, senior economist at McCarthy, Crisanti & Maffei Inc., a New York consulting firm. He added that the rise in durable goods orders, which most economists regard as a predictive indicator, "points to a pretty robust recovery in manufacturing."
That was also the message in the day's other data. Sales of existing homes rebounded 6 percent in May to the highest level since December 1989, and the Conference Board's consumer confidence index rose to 78.0 in June, from 76.4 the month before. [Page D2.]
 
April Level Revised Higher
 Not only was the durable goods increase somewhat larger than expected, it was also calculated from an April level that was revised upward to show a gain of 3.6 percent instead of the 3 percent initially reported.
Shipments of durable goods advanced 1 percent in May, the second straight increase after five monthly declines, and unfilled orders edged down one-tenth of a percent.
The rise in orders for durables -- goods from dishwashers to locomotives that are designed to last at least three years -- embraced all leading industries except electronics and electrical equipment. Orders for transportation equipment soared 11.5 percent, those for industrial machinery and equipment jumped 4 percent and those for primary metals rose eight-tenths of 1 percent. Electronics orders fell 2.6 percent after jumping 10.8 percent in April.
"The best element is the widespread increase in new orders, particularly in the critical area of non-defense capital goods," observed Gordon Richards, an economist at the National Association of Manufacturers. This category, which includes factory equipment, posted a 4.2 percent advance after a 10 percent drop in April.
Analysts even found some reassurance in a report that sales of cars and light trucks for themiddle third of this month fell a modest 2.4 percent from levels of a year earlier. The period's annual sales pace of 6.5 million was about the same as the industry's third-quarter production plans.
Nevertheless, a notable minority of economists expect the recovery to abort within months, creating a double-dip recession like four of the previous eight since World War II.
One analyst in this camp, Sung Won Sohn of the Norwest Corporation in Minneapolis, who is head of the American Bankers Association's economic advisory committee, cited high consumer debt, a rising tax burden and continued caution among lenders.
The durable-goods report showed that while the volatile military and transportation sectors had very large increases, these accounted for only a portion of the overall 3.8 percent advance, the biggest since March 1990. Capital goods orders for the military soared 21.1 percent.
 
Non-Military Orders Up 2.5%
 With military orders excluded, new orders still rose 2.5 percent, after a 2.8 percent gain in April and a decline of 3.8 percent in March.
For capital goods industries, the 7.8 percent gain in May contrasted with an average 6.3 percent decline for March and April. Non-military orders, excluding aircraft and parts, rose 2.9 percent after increasing 3.9 percent in April and falling 6.8 percent in March.
Total durable goods orders except for transportation rose 1.4 percent, after a 5.9 percent gain in April that was the first improvement this year. Analysts recognize that the transportation figures are often skewed by orders for the Boeing Company's aircraft. That company's backlog is measured in years.
Total durable goods orders were $120.5 billion last month, or $4.4 billion more than in April. Orders for machine tools, which tumbled 19.6 percent in May, account for less than 1 percent of durable goods.

HEADLINE: Brazilian Leader Acts to Protect the Amazon

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, June 25

 BODY:
Facing criticism over Brazil's Amazon policies, President Fernando Collor de Mello has dismissed the head of Brazil's Indian protection agency and has unveiled a program to allow foreign financing of environmental projects here.
In another move, he abolished tax subsidies today that had made it profitable to cut down Amazon rain forest for farming and ranching. 
 The steps, hailed by environmentalists here, came after Mr. Collor visited Washington last week and heard eight American senators urge the Brazilian Government "to live up to its commitments on the environment and human rights in the Amazon."
The international criticism comes at a particularly sensitive moment. Next month, at the meeting of the seven leading industrial democracies in London, Brazil plans to submit a proposal for $1.5 billion in grants for a five-year program for conservation of the Brazilian rain forests.
At home, Brazilian environmentalists charge that during Mr. Collor's 15 months as President he has slashed money for Amazon preservation projects and has failed to fulfill promises to demarcate Indian lands.
The annual Amazon burning season is under way, just as Brazil's environmental agency has been paralyzed by a three-week-old strike over low pay. Of $8 million budgeted for a fire prevention program in the Amazon, only $900,000 has actually been disbursed to the agency.
On the Indian issue, Brazil's Constitution stipulates that by October 1993 the Government must survey and give legal protection to 237 areas identified as Indian homelands.
"With the Government one year old, the process of demarcation has practically stopped," reads a new report on Indian lands by the Ecumenical Center for Documentation and Information, a church group.
In Washington, Mr. Collor reportedly was irritated to learn from American lawmakers and environmentalists that up to 8,000 gold miners had reinvaded lands of the Yanomami Indian tribe. Last year, the police expelled as many as 30,000 miners from the area.
On Friday, the day after he returned from Washington, Mr. Collor dismissed Cantidio Guerreiro Guimaraes, president of Funai, Brazil's Indian protection agency. Mr. Collor said the agency head dragged his feet on demarcating a continuous Yanomami reserve in Brazil's northern state of Roraima.
"The miners are a constant menace to the health of the Yanomami," Mr. Collor said in an interview before his United States trip. "We have to guarantee the Yanomami a space so they don't lose their cultural identity or their habitat."
This week, Brazil's federal police are to resume a program of evacuating miners and dynamiting their airstrips.
Claudia Andujar, a longtime critic of Brazil's policies toward the Yanomami, said today that she believed Mr. Collor was now serious about demarcating a reserve.
"We think that with all this international pressure, President Collor is entirely interested in speeding demarcation," said Ms. Andujar, who is coordinator of a private group, the Commission for the Creation of a Yanomami Park.
In another policy turnaround, Mr. Collor announced Monday that he will allow $100 million of Brazilian debt to be exchanged every year for financing for environmental projects.
Under this financing mechanism, a foreign government or private nature group buys Brazilian debt on the secondary market, where it currently trades for 34 percent of face value. The Brazilian Government then retires the debt by paying 70 to 75 percent of its face value into a local currency account for environmental projects.
Last year, Brazilian environmentalists drew up a list of $25 million of potential projects -- training park guards, surveying park boundaries, endowing Amazon study institutes and buying jeeps and helicopters.
Although already in use in several Latin American nations, the so-called "debt for nature swaps" never started here because of opposition by Zelia Cardoso de Mello, Brazil's Economy Minister until early May.

HEADLINE: A REVIVAL IS SEEN FOR 'JUNK BONDS' AS MARKET GAINS

BYLINE: By DIANA B. HENRIQUES

 BODY:
The Wall Street market for high-risk corporate bonds, which fueled the corporate takeovers of the 1980's only to collapse after a series of defaults and bankruptcies, is showing signs of life.
More than a year after the bankruptcy of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., which pioneered and promoted the market, prices for high-risk, low-grade "junk bonds" have improved sharply, the market seems calmer and major buyers, sellers and underwriters are starting to describe the recovery as viable and real. 
 If a new junk bond market takes hold, the effects will be felt from Wall Street to Washington. Companies in need of credit would be less dependent on scarce bank loans. The owners of junk bonds, including a host of savings and loan institutions and insurance companies, would be able to value their assets more accurately and sell them more easily and at better prices.
 
Rescue Cost Could Be Cut
 That, in turn, could pare the bill for rescuing insolvent savings and loans and ease the strain on the nation's insurance industry.
Junk bonds are corporate bonds whose creditworthiness is at the low end of the grading scale used by Wall Street rating agencies. They came to prominence during the 1980's when they were used by many corporate raiders to stage hostile takeovers that reshaped some of America's largest corporations, and that were blamed for plant closings, job losses and community upheavals.
The collapse of many junk bond deals also caused bruising losses for many individual investors who were initially attracted to their eye-catching yields. With the bankruptcy of Drexel and the criminal prosecution of Michael R. Milken, the head of the firm's junk bond operation, the market shriveled and seemed on the verge of vanishing.
But the market seems to have confounded its critics. It has weathered both the Persian Gulf war and an economic recession, two developments that were widely thought to be deadly for junk bond investors. The market is coping surprisingly well with the junk bond sales conducted as part of the Federal bailout of insolvent savings and loans that were major junk bond holders.
Market research is broader, as firms like Merrill Lynch, Salomon Brothers and Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette have stepped in to fill the knowledge gap left by Drexel's demise. And new ways of obtaining current, realistic prices are springing up to guide the traders who are tiptoeing back to the game.
The clearest sign of recovery is the market's ability to absorb new issues. Since January, three major corporations, RJR Nabisco, Chiquita Brands and Johnston Coca-Cola Bottling Group, have been able to find buyers for a total of $1.85 billion worth of newly issued junk bonds. At least three more new issues totaling $675 million have been announced. Last year, by contrast, only $385.8 million worth of new junk bonds were issued publicly, most of it by only two corporations.
 
'Fundamental Reason to Exist'
 "The market has a fundamental reason to exist," said Garrett Moran, managing director of the high-yield bond department at Donaldson, Lufkin. "Companies need to raise money to grow their company or make sensible acquisitions. The market is a lot smaller, the deals will be smaller, and the buyer universe will be smaller. But if the deals make sense you'll be surprised how many buyers there are."
Donaldson, Lufkin did almost $1 billion worth of private junk bond financings last year because "there was so much dislocation in the public market," Mr. Moran added. "If I had those deals to do today, I'd do them as public deals -- there's absolutely no question about it."
Philip Sanford, senior vice president and treasurer of Johnston Coca-Cola in Chattanooga, Tenn., said he would have been leery of trying to raise money in the junk bond market a year ago. " Clearly there were questions created about the marketplace," he added. "Any issuer would have felt less comfortable than now. But our recent issue was very successful. Our underwriters tell us it was oversubscribed, with new buyers as well as repeat buyers."
Those who buy bonds also see a sharp improvement. "The market machinery is much stronger that it was," said Morris W. Offit, chief executive of Offitbank, a New York money manager specializing in bonds. "You have securities firms committing more resources to the area, in terms of trading, research and sales distribution. And institutional portfolios are taking a close look at the issues. There is still enough of a yield differential to give you an incentive to buy, as long as you do your homework."
 
Reminder to Investors
 For now, no one is predicting that this reborn junk market will grow into the behemoth it became in the 1980's, when junk bonds fueled a binge of poorly structured deals that made Wall Street rich and left many American corporations laden with expensive debt. Indeed, the failure of many of those companies to pay their bond obligations today is a constant reminder to investors that junk bonds remain a risky venture. But even major defaults do not rattle the market as they once did, as investors have become better at assessing the debt renegotiation process.
"It's not a completely healthy market yet," said Kingman Penniman, senior vice president in the MCM Investment Research unit at Duff & Phelps, a credit rating agency in Chicago. "But it's certainly been wheeled out of critical care and into the recovery room."
The prognosis was far less encouraging in the months immediately after Drexel limped from the scene. Firm price quotations were difficult to come by, the available quotes were at fire-sale levels, few dealers were willing to make trades, and analysts were leaving the market in droves. Then came last summer, with the threat of war, an economic recession and an uncertain regulatory climate.
 
Surprises on Regulatory Front
 It has helped, of course, that the gulf war ended so quickly, and that the recession's end is almost, if not certainly, in sight. But market analysts say the real surprises have been on the regulatory front, most notably, the skill with which the Resolution Trust Corporation has handled the $9.1 billion portfolio of junk bonds it accumulated in the course of the savings and loan bailout.
Fears that a clumsy liquidation of that portfolio would swamp the unsteady junk market have proved groundless. "I give them all the credit in the world," said Martin S. Fridson, managing director of Merrill Lynch's high-yield research unit. "They have felt their way along to see how much they can sell, and how quickly. They've handled it extremely well, and that has reassured the market."
Market participants have also started to solve some of the information problems that plagued them last year. Duff & Phelps, for example, is offering a new electronic service to provide daily price quotations, based on actual transactions, for 100 junk bonds, and weekly price quotes for more than 200 additional issues.
And a six-month rally has helped push junk bond prices up to levels that are attracting the attention of professional investors. The investment return on junk bonds this year, as measured by Merrill Lynch's high-yield bond index, is up nearly 20 percent, after a 4.35 percent decline last year. The flow of funds into junk bond mutual funds is improving, and some pension funds have been shopping in the higher-grade end of the junk market, portfolio managers report.
Although the economic forecast and the gyrations of the stock market still have a powerful effect on junk bond prices, the tone of the market is so much improved that the chief junk bond analyst at Salomon Brothers reversed his earlier pessimism and endorsed junk bonds early last week as a good long-term investment.
"I had not been bullish for two years," said Joseph C. Bencivenga, the director of high-yield research at Salomon. "But I am definitely optimistic now. When things are fairly priced, it is hard for people to argue with the product."
Mr. Fridson, of Merrill Lynch, is similarly encouraged. "The market adjusted very quickly to all its problems, and now we're in a position where you can do a reasonable level of business," he said. "We're not going to get back to the Drexel days, with $30 billion in new issuance a year. But there's a reasonable flow of business, and people are feeling much better about the conditions in the market."
 
Nervousness on Insurers
 The market is still nervously waiting to see how state insurance regulators handle the insolvencies of the First Executive Corporation and the First Capital Corporation, two insurance holding companies that had invested heavily in junk bonds. "That's the next 800-pound gorilla this market has to deal with," said Mr. Bencivenga. "Together, they have about $14 billion to $15 billion worth of junk bonds and nobody is eager to see that hit the market." But the regulators have indicated that they will not liquidate the portfolio in a hasty fashion, he added, so he is not unduly alarmed.
Not everyone in the market is as confident. Some analysts point out that defaults are expected in about $20 billion worth of junk bonds this year, not counting bond issues that are renegotiated before an official default. That is almost 10 percent of the total market, and five times the default level the market had expected back in the early 1980's.
 
Warning by Magazine
 Investment Dealer's Digest, a magazine serving the brokerage community, recently ran a cautionary cover story warning that the mutual funds that are now investing in junk bonds could flee the market just as quickly at the first sign of trouble, increasing volatility and demolishing prices. The magazine warned traders against becoming overly optimistic.
But for Mr. Bencivenga, this cover story itself was evidence of the market's changed mood; it is unthinkable, he said, that any publication would have felt it necessary or newsworthy to emphasize the junk bond market's weaknesses just a few months ago.
"This is the way markets work," he said. "They overreact in both directions. We're coming off a huge bottom, where investors overreacted in pounding prices down. We've weeded out the players who don't want to be here. What's left are the people who do want to be here. All told, I think we're poised for continued double-digit annual returns, despite the defaults."

HEADLINE: Interstate Banking Provision Survives House Panel Votes

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 25

 BODY:
The Bush Administration's proposal to eliminate barriers to interstate banking survived a concentrated assault in the House Banking Committee today.
In the Administration's banking package, the interstate provision is widely considered the plank most likely to succeed in Congress. 
 But there is significant opposition to other parts of the package that the committee will take up this week, including elimination of restrictions dating to the Depression that prevent commercial banks and investment banks from merging and that also limit the ability of industrial enterprises to own banks.
The steady erosion of the fund that insures bank deposits has put the banking legislation on a fast track, and Administration officials hope the insurance fund's plight will provide a political impetus for Congress to adopt its legislation by fall. The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress that audits the insurance fund, has said the fund is virtually insolvent -- an opinion not shared by the chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, L. William Seidman, who maintains that the fund was worth $8.4 billion at the end of last year.
 
Time Is Running Out
 With Congress in session less than five weeks between now and the middle of September, a growing number of lawmakers say there is not enough time to craft sweeping legislation this year.
At this point, the most likely result seen by lawmakersis a banking bill that would allow a few changes for the industry, such as more liberal rules on interstate banking, and would refinance the insurance fund by permitting it to borrow up to $30 billion from the Treasury. Administration officials fear that once Congress addresses the plight of the insurance fund, there may not be enough political support to muster more changes next year.
Today, the House banking committee rejected a series of amendments that would have either deleted or drastically watered down the interstate banking section of the Administration's legislation.
 
A Hamiltonian Tilt
 While the names were not invoked, the debate today has its roots in almost 200 years of argument going back to Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton over the roles of community banks versus national banks in the economy. The committee's votes strongly endorsed the Hamiltonian view of empowering the national banks to expand into new states at the possible expense of the community institutions.
By a vote of 35 to 15, the committee rejected a measure by Representative Bruce F. Vento, Democrat of Minnesota, that would continue to permit state legislators to determine whether out-of-state banks could open new branches in their states. The measure has been widely supported by organizations representing the states, state regulators and community bankers.
"What the amendment does is restore the voice of states in the area of interstate branching," Mr. Vento said.
Opposing the amendment, Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, said that "very few members have a consistent preference for the Federal or the state level."
The committee then rejected by a vote of 26 to 23 an amendment that, among other things, would have given state legislatures three years to opt out of interstate banking and branching.
An amendment by Representative Jim Leach, Republican of Iowa, to require banks interested in expanding to have a higher level of capital to absorb losses, was defeated 25 to 24.
 
A Break for Low-Cost Accounts
 The committee also adopted a measure that would reduce the Federal insurance fund premiums for banks that provide loans to distressed neighborhoods and offer low-cost accounts to low-income customers.
The amendment, introduced by Representative Thomas J. Ridge, Republican of Pennsylvania, and Representative Floyd Flake, Democrat of New York, passed by a vote of 37 to 11. It would reduce bank premiums to 11.5 cents per $100 for all low-cost, limited accounts now offered to lower-income customers. Beginning next month, banks are to pay 23 cents per $100 in deposits.
The amendment would also provide banks with a discount in their premiums equal to 5 percent of all increased deposits and loans provided in distressed neighborhoods. The discount is capped at 20 percent of the bank's total assessment.

HEADLINE: Few of the Working Poor Get Houses in S.& L. Rescue Plan

SERIES: Vanishing Homes - First of two articles.

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex.

 BODY:
It's a tale of dreams gone awry.
When Congress created the Resolution Trust Corporation in 1989 to clean up the savings and loan mess, it decided to set aside thousands of foreclosed houses and apartments as low-cost housing for low-income people. 
 The notion was elegant in its simplicity: housing for the needy, thanks to the savings and loan crisis. The Government could provide decent shelter without spending a dime on new public housing. And the working poor, at long last, could own a home at a price they could pay.
It has not worked out like that. Virtually everyone agrees that the program has fallen short of its goals, though how far short is in dispute.
 
Harsh Views Expressed
 "It's an unmitigated disaster," said Richard Jordan, a former board member of the Texas Housing Authority and a real estate investor. "The Government had the unprecedented opportunity to disperse people into single-family detached homes and it hasn't. Why? Because the program stinks."
Mr. Jordan is not alone in his view. Members of Congress and advocates of affordable housing say the Government has failed almost completely to exploit an important and rare opportunity.
Resolution Trust acknowledges that thus far only a small portion of the houses in the program have gone to the poor. But officials insist they have labored to devise policies to tackle an extremely difficult task, and they say that such a program cannot be established overnight. Stephen S. Allen, the corporation's head of affordable housing, said that under the circumstances "what we have accomplished has been remarkable."
 
Middle Class Gets Bargain
 At any rate, thousands of inexpensive homes that could have gone to low-income buyers under the program have, in fact, been siphoned off and bought by investors. Middle-class buyers, who could otherwise afford housing, have been flocking to take advantage of bargain prices. And the working poor who could benefit the most from this program have been virtually shut out by, among other things, a lack of mortgages for them.
The program's critics contend that the Bush Administration, which fiercely opposed the program when it was initially set up by Congress, has actively tried to scuttle it through policies that discriminate against the poor.
Among them was a program that offered bigger discounts and better financing to sophisticated investors than to low-income buyers. Some of these policies have changed, housing advocates say, but the basic problems still exist.
"This has been a tremendous lost opportunity," said Frank H. Shafroth, director of Federal relations for the National League of Cities in Washington. "Something wonderful could have happened to a lot of families in America. But it didn't."
Representative Bruce F. Vento, a Minnesota Democrat who was chairman of a special Congressional task force on Resolution Trust, said he was disappointed. "The Administration and the R.T.C. had to be dragged kicking and screaming into the affordable-housing program," he said. "They have a basic reluctance to implement the law."
Mr. Allen of Resolution Trust said the expectations of the critics were unrealistic. "You can't help lower-income people buy when you have a mandate to return the maximum dollars to the Government," he said, "and it's a conflict. So it's an ongoing challenge for us to reach our target market."
 
The Program
Social Policy Vs. Top Dollar
 To carry out the program, Resolution Trust has hired an impressive array of bureaucrats with a long history of service to the poor. But they find themselves caught between the agency's conflicting goals: Selling real estate at top dollar to reduce the cost of the savings and loan bailout for all taxpayers, and selling small houses at affordable prices. The agency is working at the juncture of social policy and quick real estate sales, and money talks.
Under the program as set up by Congress, a 90-day window was created in which low-income buyers and nonprofit organizations have the exclusive chance to buy Resolution Trust properties appraised at less than $67,500. If there are no takers, the houses are offered on the open market.
As of the end of April, 17,372 houses and 489 apartment complexes with 65,097 individual apartments have fallen within these guidelines. This represents $1.6 billion in real estate, or 10 percent of Resolution Trust's entire portfolio. And more housing will be added as the agency continues to take over insolvent savings and loans.
Besides social policy, there are strong economic incentives behind the affordable housing program. The Government estimates that it costs $18.25 a day, or about $6,600 a year, to carry a foreclosed house. At the same time, new public housing costs anywhere from $60,000 to $100,000 a unit.
 
No Problems of Location
 In one fell swoop, the Government could lop off hundreds of millions of dollars in real estate carrying costs and provide new public housing on the cheap. And, since the houses already exist, there are none of the "not in my backyard" problems that often arise when new public housing projects are planned.
"If you believe the Government should intervene to help low and moderate families, this should be the way," said Representative Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat and advocate of the program. "It's the lowest per-unit cost to the Government."
But sales so far have been agonizingly slow. Only 2,500 houses had been sold by May 1 and, by the end of that month, 13 apartment buildings had been sold. Critics contend that few of the houses have actually gone to low-income people.
At the same time, 3,300 houses and 174 apartment complexes have passed through the 90-day window unsold. In Texas, where nearly half the affordable properties are, brokers say many of these have since been snapped up by investors eager to take advantage of the prices, which for houses taken as part of savings and loans failures are substantially lower than those on the general real estate market.
An additional 3,998 houses appraised at less than $67,500 never even got into the program and were sold to other buyers because of a rule, only recently changed, that excluded houses of savings and loans associations the Government had declared insolvent but had not yet seized. These houses were placed on the open market.
 
Trying to Qualify
Most Refused As Credit Risks
 Such numbers take on real meaning for DeeDee Cyphers, a single mother of three in Austin who is stretching to make ends meet on the $19,000 she earns as a senior accounting clerk for Travis County.
Ms. Cyphers is one of the people the program is intended to benefit. But, as with many like her, it has failed to reach her. "It's like the American dream is not coming true for the working poor," she said.
One day, a fellow employee showed Ms. Cyphers a flier for the Resolution Trust program. Intrigued, she got a list of properties and, with a broker, found a $26,000 house in a neighborhood she fell in love with. Her offer was accepted and a "sold" sign sprouted by the house. At night, she would drive by just to look. "It wasn't a mansion but it was cute," she said, "a nice place to raise my kids that wasn't trashed with drugs."
Even more attractive was the monthly mortgage payment of $308, much less than the $425 she struggles to pay in rent.
 
The Bank Says No
 But Ms. Cyphers was turned down at the bank. This happened even though she had the down payment, had held the same job for five years and was applying under a special program of the Texas Housing Authority, which issued bonds specifically to provide mortgage money to local banks for low-income buyers of agency properties.
But the bank, in this case Guaranty Federal Savings, and not the housing authority makes the final credit decision. And the bank did not like the fact that seven years ago, when Ms. Cyphers and her former husband were laid off, they returned a leased car to a dealer who wanted the payments instead.
For Ms. Cyphers, this disappointment turned into "heartbreak," in her words, when she learned recently that Resolution Trust was planning to give away to nonprofit agencies up to 3,000 houses it said it could not sell. Some of these are in bad shape but can certainly be fixed up.
"The R.T.C. is trying to give away houses and here I want to pay for one," she said. "I think they should try to help the working poor who are trying to get back on their feet. The houses are supposed to be affordable -- to help the people out. If I were rich, I wouldn't need the R.T.C."
 
Oversight
Critics Say Board Hampered Program
 Much of the program's poor showing has been attributed by critics to restrictions in the initial law and to implementation policies of Resolution Trust's Oversight Board, whose members include Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, and Jack F. Kemp, Housing and Urban Development Secretary.
The board allowed the agency to make big discounts in all properties except those in the affordable-housing program until just three months ago when Congress halted the practice by threatening to withhold the agency's funds. The effect was that people were buying houses outside the program cheaper than the poor could get them within the program during the 90-day period.
And seller financing had been offered by the agency to buyers of all other properties -- except in the affordable-housing program, where Resolution Trust two years later is beginning to develop a limited program of financing for low-income buyers.
"There was just an ideological objection to helping poor people," Representative Frank said. The Bush Administration, he charged, "felt that poor people were a pain and they don't need them."
 
Board Defends Actions
 Not so, say members of the Administration and the Oversight Board. "We've been pro-active in affordable housing," said Peter H. Monroe, president of the board. "In terms of the dollars the R.T.C. will collect from real estate, maybe 1 percent will come from residential affordable real estate."
Alfred A. DelliBovi, Under Secretary for Housing and Urban Development, said, "I can assure you there has been no foot-dragging by the Administration to carry out this law."
Critics acknowledge that some of the flaws in the program have been corrected but say the low-income citizens who were to have been given preference are still for the most part missing out.
 
The Texas Experience
Few of the Poor Get Houses
 Nowhere are the problems more apparent than in Texas, where real estate prices have fallen so drastically that nearly every house that falls into the the agency's hands meets the affordable-housing guidelines. And, nearly half of all affordable houses to be sold by the agency are in Texas, where the Texas Housing Authority estimates that 60,000 people are homeless. In Dallas, there is a two-year waiting list for public housing.
Potential buyers and nonprofit organizations said in interviews that accurate information on what houses were available had been almost impossible to get. The bidding process is described as a nightmare of paperwork that discourages real estate brokers from even showing properties.
Before putting down a $500 earnest-money deposit on a house in the program, a prospective buyer must fill out a 25-page form. Until recently, the agency's real estate contract was 45 pages long instead of the standard 3 pages. "I've sold commercial property for the R.T.C. and that was a pain in the neck," a Houston broker said. "But it's nothing like the affordable-housing program. It's more of a headache than it's worth."
 
Mortgages Hard to Get
 More important, mortgage financing for low-income people has been hard to come by, despite the housing authority's bond issue, which raised $142 million to fund 8.35 percent mortgages through banks that would lend to the low-income buyers.
So far, only 384 such loans have been made, leaving the agency with $122.5 million in unused mortgages. This comes despite a telephone hotline that has been getting nearly 800 calls a day, newspaper and radio ads and a mailing to more than 14,000 homes.
"The consumer is tearing down our door," said Richard H. Garza, former acting executive director of the authority. "Every time we put out a news release our telephone lines go haywire."
Much of the problem is that low-income people are not perceived as good credit risks. "If a low-income buyer has anything shaky on his credit record, he gets tossed out," said Elizabeth Wolff, head of the Dallas office of the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, or Acorn, a nonprofit agency. "Only the squeaky clean can qualify."
Resolution Trust was authorized by Congress to help provide financing for low income people but so far has done little. The banks, for their part, have been generally quick to turn down low-income applicants, although housing advocates argue that lending to big investors is often chancier, as illustrated by the savings and loan disaster. At any rate, if the program is to work, the process of getting mortgages will have to be made easier for those with low incomes.
 
Disappointed Callers
 "I was naive to think that this program could work for the low income," said Skip Beaird, executive director of the Housing Resources Association, a nonprofit Austin agency. "We get 60 calls a day from people excited that there might be something for them. But there isn't."
Each Wednesday night, Mr. Beaird and an assistant, MaryLee Claborn, sit in a conference room at the Travis County Human Services Building painstakingly counseling low-income people on where to get a Resolution Trust property list, how to find a broker and where to apply for a mortgage.
But they can recall only 3 people ever getting a house of the 1,000 or so they have counseled.
"The R.T.C. has a brochure that says, 'If you're paying $250 a month or more in rent, the R.T.C. wants to help you own your home,' " Ms. Claborn said, "And every time I see that, I get angry, its so misleading."
 
Speculation
Hawaiian Investors Find Texas Deals
 The Resolution Trust office in Dallas is in a gleaming high-rise in an exclusive neighborhood, where Jane Keefe, head of the agency's Southwestern Regional Affordable Housing Office, oversees the program. Through the program, she said, 1,134 Texas houses have been sold at an average price of $41,000.
About half these sales, she said, were to people below 80 percent median income, or under $35,000 a year for a family of four. "For us to have half our sales to the really low-income families, I'd say we're successful," she said. Ms. Keefe said that 900 houses that passed through the 90-day window and gone unsold would be re-listed to give low-income people another chance.
But housing advocates question just how successful Resolution Trust is, even by its own tally. And they question who exactly is buying the homes.
Through the Freedom of Information Act, John J. Henneberger, director of the Texas Low Income Housing Information Service, a nonprofit corporation, obtained lists of houses that the agency said it sold in Texas under the program.
 
 
Bought for Cash
 By comparing the Resolution Trust lists with courthouse deeds, Mr. Henneberger said he found that many of the properties the agency said it sold were never sold at all. Other properties, he said, were purchased by investment groups from as far away as Hawaii and many were bought for cash -- in amounts up to $30,000. Many of these properties had passed through the 90-day window and were sold to investors.
Mr. Henneberger and other housing advocates suspect that brokers are lying low until after the 90-day period and then pushing these properties to buyers with ready cash.
In Austin, for instance, Mr. Henneberger's spot check turned up condominiums with initial appraisals as high as $95,000 being sold to Hawaiian investors at prices in the $20,000 to $30,000 range. These were then listed as affordable-housing sales.
Mr. Henneberger said many questions were raised by the data: How did condos with high appraisals got into the program in the first place? Why were investors getting such good deals and not low-income people?
"What's emerging is a lot of confusion," Mr. Henneberger said. "The R.T.C. doesn't know what sold under the program -- so how can they continue to turn out reports to Congress." "
Ms. Keefe said the lists might have bookkeeping errors and denied that houses were slipping with any frequency into the hands of rich investors during the 90 days.
But houses have slipped through.
Recently, Resolution Trust agreed to sell 36 Texas homes in the affordable-housing program to a Houston real estate broker who had formed a charity -- the Lung Transplant Foundation Inc. -- just a day before he submitted his bid. The houses were being sold to the broker for $500 each and his son was to have collected a $500 commission on each sale -- or some $18,000 in all. But after an article about the transactions appeared on June 6 in The San Antonio Light, the agency canceled the sale.
About 20 percent of the Texas sales have been in cash, according to the agency's Dallas office. It said low-income people were often suspicious of banks and kept their money at home. Deborah Kroupa, a housing specialist with Acorn, disputed this. Low-income people, she said, rarely have more than $1,000 or $2,000 in "mattress money."
Ms. Kroupa said the money came from speculators who could get a friend or a relative to qualify for the program, buy the property and pay cash so there was no paperwork. Several months later, the buyer moves out, the house is refinanced and is converted into valuable property.
Ms. Kroupa should know. She said this was work she once did herself as a real estate buyer but stopped because she said her conscience bothered her. "It's a legal loophole," Ms. Kroupa said. "All it takes is knowledge and money."
How to reform or refine the program?
Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum, Democrat of Ohio, said for one thing he would introduce a measure in Congress to extend the 90-day window to 180 days. Nearly all nonprofit agencies would like to see the trust corporation streamline its marketing and sales process and offer financing help and greater price discounts to low-income families.
And some individuals and groups have already started to work with private banks to broaden credit standards to make more low-income persons eligible for mortages.
As Mr. Jordan, the Austin developer, put it: "It should be as easy for a low-income person to buy a house as it is for a low-income person to buy a car."

Beazer Shifting to U.S. In Sale of Europe Units

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: LONDON, June 25

 BODY:
Beazer P.L.C. said today that it planned to sell its European house-building, real estate and contracting operations to concentrate on its building-materials businesses in the United States.
The conglomerate, which owns the Koppers Company in Pittsburgh, a building-materials concern, said it would offer all of its European operation to the public and would list the stock on the London Stock Exchange, probably in late September. It had said on April 23 that it was considering such a move. 
 The spinoff would probably raise about $880 million, analysts said.
Beazer also said it was considering whether to move its headquarters from Bath, England, to the United States after the sale.
Beazer said it intended to use the proceeds to repay some of its $1.63 billion in debt, some of which was incurred when it bought Koppers for $1.8 billion in 1988.
Beazer also said it had been working with its primary bankers, National Westminster Bank P.L.C. and Citibank, to refinance its debt.
The company said its European business was suffering from economic weakness and the effects of a strong dollar.
More than 75 percent of the company's assets and 60 percent of its operating earnings are in the United States, and about 34 percent of its ordinary shares are held in the form of American depository receipts.
The A.D.R.'s fell $1.875 today on the New York Stock Exchange, to $7.75. The 19.4 percent drop was the Big Board's largest in percentage terms.
In the fiscal year that ended on June 30, 1990, Beazer had after-tax profits of about $116 million on revenues of $3.8 billion.

HEADLINE: Vehicle Sales Dropped 2.4% In Mid-June

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, June 25

 BODY:
Sales of domestically made cars and light trucks fell 2.4 percent in mid-June, but the decline did not dampen hopes that the auto market is recovering.
The nine United States and Japanese auto makers that assemble cars in North America sold 212,116 cars in the June 11-20 period, a drop of four-tenths of a percent from the 212,910 cars sold a year earlier. 
 For the period, the seasonally adjusted annual rate of domestic car sales was 6.5 million, still a good deal lower than the 7.4 million trend of the last few years, but significantly higher than the 5.5 million rate for April, when the market seemed to reach a trough. The rate was 6.3 million in early June.
 
'Very Encouraging' Numbers
 The light-truck sales of the six American and Japanese truck manufacturers dropped 5.7 percent, to 121,364, from 128,718 a year ago.
Tom Webb, chief economist for the National Automobile Dealers Association, called the sales figures "very encouraging."
John Casesa, automotive analyst for Wertheim Schroder & Company in New York, said: "The automotive recovery definitely is coming in fits and starts. This period I would characterize as better than expected."
The General Motors Corporation, the world's largest producer, sold 101,743 cars, a drop of six-tenths of a percent from a year earlier, and 50,248 light trucks, down 1.9 percent. But for the first time in five years G.M.'s Chevrolet division could boast of higher year-to-date car and truck sales than its chief rival, the Ford division of the Ford Motor Company.
David Hudgens, a Chevrolet spokesman, said the division planned to send congratulatory messages by computer to its 4,700 dealers. G.M.'s Buick, Oldsmobile and GMC truck divisions posted gains, while sales of Cadillacs and Pontiacs were down.
Joel Pitcoff, a Ford sales analyst, said Chevrolet had been selling heavily to fleet buyers, like car-rental companies, while Ford sold proportionately more cars at retail. Ford, the nation's No. 2 auto maker, sold 51,091 cars, a 14.8 percent decline from a year earlier, and 40,071 light trucks, a 13.7 percent decline.
Ward's Automotive Reports estimated that the Chrysler Corporation, which reports its sales only by month, sold 21,750 cars in mid-June, a 12.5 percent drop, and 25,250 light trucks, a 6.4 percent drop.
The three largest Japanese producers all posted sharp increases in sales of cars and light trucks built in North America. In recent months Japanese auto makers have begun to use dealer rebates and subsidized leasing plans more aggressively in an attempt to continue to increase their share of the weak market.
The Honda Motor Company sold 18,077 cars, up 60.3 percent from the 11,280 sold a year earlier. Sales of Honda's Accord model, which carries dealer rebates of up to $750, reached 12,203, compared with 5,973 in the 1990 period. Earlier this year, Honda's inventory of Accords became uncomfortably swollen.
The Toyota Motor Corporation's sales of domestically built cars rose 31 percent, to 10,387, from 7,936 a year earlier. Camry sales were up 36.3 percent, and sales of the smaller Corolla model rose 22.9 percent. Toyota said its total vehicle sales, including imports, were up 25 percent in mid-June. The auto maker said sales of its recently introduced Paseo coupe and its redesigned Tercel subcompact had been strong.
The Nissan Motor Company said its car sales advanced 14.9 percent for the period, to 3,634, while light-truck sales gained 7.8 percent, to 3,737.

HEADLINE: Sales of Existing Houses Rose 6 Percent Last Month

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 25

 BODY:
Lower mortgage rates continued to lure home buyers in May, lifting sales of existing single-family houses by 6 percent, to their highest level in 18 months, a real estate trade group said today.
"Low mortgage rates and increased consumer confidence are fueling momentum in the housing market and allowing entry-level buyers to finally get up the courage to dive into the market," said Harley E. Rouda, president of the National Association of Realtors. 
 The group said sales of previously owned single-family houses were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.51 million in May, the highest since the 3.56 million rate in December 1989.
 
Low Point in January
 Sales of existing homes plunged to a 2.9 million rate in January, but have increased each month since then, including gains of 9 percent in February and 1.9 percent in March. New-home sales and housing starts as well as applications for building permits have also increased since January.
John A. Tuccillo, the trade organization's chief economist, said that as the recovery takes hold, sales of existing homes "should be healthy for the remainder of 1991 and robust in 1992."
According to surveys by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, the interest rate for 30-year conventional fixed-rate mortgages averaged 9.47 percent in May, down nearly one percentage point from the same month in 1990.
The median price of an existing home was $99,700, up 4.7 percent from the May 1990 price, but six-tenths of a percent below that of April. The median price means half of the homes cost more and half cost less.
Sales in the Northeast, which rose 2.8 percent in April, slipped 1.9 percent in May to an annual rate of 530,000 units. The median price in the region was $143,600, 1.9 percent above that of May 1990. Sales rose in the Midwest, West and South.

Wells Fargo's Wall St. Shocker

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, June 25

 BODY:
Wells Fargo & Company stunned Wall Street today by announcing that it would increase its reserve for loan losses in the second quarter to about $350 million, or more than four times the $85 million it set aside in the first quarter of 1991. The increase will sharply lower earnings.
The announcement confirmed some investors' fears that the recession and the real estate slump would drag down California banks as it has banks in the Southwest and Northeast. 
 But Wells Fargo said real estate loans were not material to the bank's second-quarter results. It said the majority of the nonperforming loans were commercial loans for deals that involved large amounts of debt.
 
Stock Slumps
 "Real estate was not a significant contributor to our second-quarter results," Rod Jacobs, Wells Fargo's vice chairman and chief financial officer, said in an interview. "That's not to say there was no increase in real estate nonperforming loans -- it was just not material." The $400 million in loans put on nonaccrual were commercial industrial loans, not secured by real estate, much of it the senior debt involved in leveraged buyouts or other restructurings.
Wells Fargo's increased loss provision was in part the result of a review by Federal regulators of its loans. Results for the quarter will reflect the recent Shared National Credit Regulatory Examination for all commercial and real estate loans of $20 million or more held by two or more banks, Wells said.
The company's stock fell $6.50, to $74, on the New York Stock Exchange today, after a delay in trading caused by large imbalances between buy and sell orders. The stock had dropped $6.50 on Monday in anticipation of the problems. The announcement hurt the stocks of other banks as well, including Wells's biggest California competitors. BankAmerica was down $1.50, to $35.875 a share; Security Pacific dropped $1.375, to $23.25, and First Interstate fell $2.25, to $34.
Critics have been predicting for months that Wells Fargo would be the next big bank to stumble, noting that it has a much higher exposure to real estate loans than its California competitors. Real estate loans, including residential mortgages and home equity loans, account for 53 percent of Wells Fargo's portfolio, compared with 35 percent at BankAmerica.
But supporters, like the Omaha investor Warren E. Buffett, who last month sought regulatory approval to raise his holdings in the bank from 9.7 percent, to as much as 22 percent, have argued that California real estate is not the same as Texas real estate and will not be severely hurt by the recession.
Wells said it expected loan losses in the second quarter to be about $180 million, up from $67 million in the first quarter. Because of the loan-loss provision, the company estimated that it would earn about $15 million, or 20 cents a share, in the second quarter, compared with $232.4 million, or $4.40 a share, a year earlier. Analysts had estimated that the bank would earn as much as $2.95 a share.
"Even with this large provision, Wells Fargo is still going to produce earnings for the quarter," Carl E. Reichardt, Wells Fargo's chairman and chief executive, said. "If we had not made this loss provision, our earnings in the second quarter would have exceeded $3 per share."
Wells Fargo said it would place about $400 million in commercial loans, about half of which involve deals with heavy debt, on nonaccrual. That means that although the loans are current, they are not considered good credit risks. Wells said its total nonaccrual and restructured loans would increase by about $450 million. The increase in the loan-loss provision will result in a total reserve of more than $1 billion, compared with $905 million last March 31.
 
'We Remain Cautious'
 "The increase in nonaccruals this quarter reflects national economic trends," Mr. Reichardt said. "There is some evidence of an upturn in the economy, but we remain cautious and expect continued pressure on the loan portfolio at this point."
After Wells Fargo made its announcement, Fitch Investors Service said it had placed the bank's $450 million in AA senior debt and $1.7 billion in AA- subordinated debt on an alert with negative implications. Fitch said that an increase in the company's problem assets was expected during 1991, but that the jump in nonperforming assets during the second quarter was well outside the range Fitch anticipated.
While Wells's loan portfolio had a high-risk profile, measurements of asset quality had not shown meaningful deterioration until now, Fitch said.

HEADLINE: 2 YUGOSLAV STATES VOTE INDEPENDENCE TO PRESS DEMANDS

BYLINE: By CHUCK SUDETIC, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LJUBLJANA, Yugoslavia, Wednesday, June 26

 BODY:
The Parliaments of the Yugoslav republics of Slovenia and Croatia overwhelmingly passed declarations of independence Tuesday that could lead to full secession if their demands for a new, more loosely bound Yugoslavia are not met by Belgrade.
After an emergency late-night meeting, Yugoslavia's federal Government responded early this morning by calling the republics's actions illegal and ordering national army and police units to seize control posts along Slovenia's borders. 
 It remains uncertain when the military and police forces would attempt to take control of Slovenia's border crossings, which now include posts along the republic's border with Croatia. A Slovene government official reached by telephone this morning said that the federal troops had not yet taken such action,
It is clear, however, that the battle of wills between federal authorities and the leaders of the two renegade republics has entered a new phase that raises the possibility of bloodshed.
 
Army Intervention Sought
 Leaders in both republics have said that federal authorities, including the national army, would be required to ask for permission to move across the republics' territories.
"We still favor negotiations," President Milan Kucan of Slovenia said Tuesday. "But in order that real negotiations take place, we have opted for independence."
Even though the Slovene and Croatian leaders clearly prefer to remain in a decentralized Yugoslav federation, the political atmosphere is charged because of the possibility of bloodshed and instability through miscalculation.
Citing such concerns, the European Community and the United States have both said they will not recognize the independence of Yugoslavia's two most pro-Western and wealthiest republics. Many Western leaders have recalled that World War I had its roots in the fiery nationalism of this region.
In response to the action by the two republics, the federal Parliament in Belgrade asked the national army Tuesday evening to intervene immediately to prevent the country's dismemberment. The national Parliament, however, has no power to order the army into action.
Prime Minister Ante Markovic has repeatedly warned that he would resort to all legal means to prevent the republics from becoming truly sovereign states, as the declarations say they now are.
Both Slovenia and Croatia have warned for a year that they would secede from Yugoslavia if the country was not recast as a loose confederation. But even now leaders of both republics are insisting that despite the independence declarations they are still eager to discuss creation of a new Yugoslav union with the other four republics.
Both independence declarations spoke of "disassociation" from Yugoslavia. A draft of the Croatian version, obtained by The Associated Press, proclaimed a "sovereign and independent state" and declared: "By this act the Republic of Croatia initiates the process of disassociation from the other republics."
Slovenian and Croatian leaders maintain that the national army, whose Serbian-dominated officer corps commands a multi-ethnic force, would disintegrate if it were ordered to put down the movements toward independence.
 
'A Few Armored Cars'
 "Any military action would amount to occupation," said Janez Jansa, Slovenia's defense minister. "It would take more than a few armored cars."
Yugoslavia's currency, the dinar, will remain the sole legal tender in Slovenia and Croatia for the time being, although the parliaments of both republics have adopted laws providing for the creation of their own currencies and national banks.
The Yugoslav Army will also maintain bases in Slovenia and Croatia for the present, But both republics have already organized their own armed forces and plan to negotiate the army's withdrawal in discussions that they are already likening to the German-Soviet talks on the Red Army's withdrawal from what was East Germany.
 
Warnings From the West
 Republican leaders say Ljubljana will recall Slovenian representatives from the federal Parliament and bureaucracy and replace them with officials designated to negotiate and oversee a gradual breaking of ties with the Belgrade Government.
In the last week, the European Community and the United States have warned Slovenia and Croatia that they would not extend diplomatic recognition to the republics as independent states nor would they offer any economic aid.
"This was to be expected," said President Kucan at a news conference here Tuesday morning. "Under international law, the legal entity is still, for the time being, the Socialist Federated Republic of Yugoslavia."
Croatia's president, Franjo Tudjman, in a speech to his republic's parliament Tuesday night, said: "We understand completely the worries of individual states and the entire European Community about the Yugoslav crisis. But we must take our own interests into consideration first."
Mr. Tudjman also said that Croatia would redouble its efforts to gain international legitmacy by sending representatives to foreign capitals and appealing to international organizations.
In contrast with the demands of Slovenia and Croatia's for a loose confederation, Serbia, the largest and most populous Yugoslav republic, has called for strengthening the Yugoslav federation. Serbia's Government of renamed and reconstituted Communists is often blamed for undermining Yugoslavia's market-based economic reform program. Serbia's government has said that a confederation is acceptable only if all of Yugoslavia's Serbs are brought within the borders of a single state. Croatia, which has a large Serbian minority, strongly opposes this.
Leaders here in Slovenia admit that they were driven to take their step to independence in part by a desire to escape the costs of conflicts between Serbs and ethnic Albanians in southern Yugoslavia as well as those involving Serbs and Croats, which have claimed several dozen lives in the last five months.
"Slovenian leaders hope that independence will lead to an improvement in the republic's political-risk assessment and pave the way for new private investment," said Joze Mencinger, a top economist and former Slovenian vice president, adding that the republican government is not counting on economic aid from foreign governments.
Subjects of Austria for about 800 years, the Slovenes chose to join Yugoslavia after the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in the waning days of World War I. This alpine republic, which has few minorities and is predominantly Roman Catholic, will find little internal resistance to moving away from the Yugoslav federation, which has been eroding since the 1980 death of Tito, the country's postwar Communist dictator.
 
'Soft Border Crossings'
 Slovene workers are already erecting what republican officials are calling "soft border crossings" at eight points between Slovenia and Croatia. Officials said the border guards would make only cursory identification checks.
Croatia, which was connected with Hungary from the beginning of the 12th century until its leaders chose to join newly formed Yugoslavia after World War I, has already met stiff opposition to its independence move from a large portion of its Serbian minority. The Serbs in Croatia have a vivid memory of mass killings by Nazi-backed Croatian nationalists during World War II and strongly oppose coming under the complete control of the Zagreb government.
Voters in Slovenia and Croatia have passed popular referendums calling for the republics to become sovereign states.

People
 Population: 2 million, about 9 percent of Yugoslavia's inhabitants. There are small Italian and Hungarian minorities.
 
History
 Slovenia war ruled by a succession of German princes until the Middle Ages, when it was incorporated into the Austrian Empire. In 1918, Slovenia joined the new kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes that later evolved into Yugoslavia. It first gained limited autonomy in the 1930's. After Yugoslavia was reconstituted as a Communits federation in 1945, all states were granted considerable self-governmemt.
 
Economy
 Traditionally one of the poorest parts of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Slovenia developed rapidly after it joined Yugoslavia and became its economically most prosperous region after World War II. Its industgries, including the Elan ski factory, were badly hit by free-market reforms and unemployment has risen.
 
Government
 Ruled by demos, a coalition of six center-right parties that defeated the reformed Communits, was elected president.

History
 The Croats created a small kingdom in the 10th century that united with Hugnary in 1102. The Turks occupied much of it before being ejected by the Austrians in the 18th century. With the fall of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Croatia joined Serbia in forming Yugoslavia. Croatian secessionists set up a Nazi puppet state that murdered hundreds of thousands of Serbs and Jews during World War II.
 
Economy
 The Adriatic coast accounts for about 80 percent of Yugoslavia's $3 billion annual earnings from tourism. Leading industries are shipbuilding, petrochemicals, food processing and agriculture. Tourism has been halved by a rebellion of ethnic Serbs near the main resorts. About a quarter of the work force is unemployed.
 
Government
 Governed by the Croatian Democratic Union, a nationalist party. The party's leader, Franjo Tudjman, a former Communist general, was named president by the legislature. Serbs have declared independence for Krajina in western Croatia.

HEADLINE: EATING WELL;
Lower-Fat Foods Vs. U.S. Standards

BYLINE: By MARIAN BURROS

 BODY:
"LIGHT butter" is a world-class oxymoron. Right up there with sweet sorrow, jumbo shrimp and military intelligence.
The existence of a product that calls itself light butter is the result of a clash between late 20th-century technology and early 20th-century law. The former, which is an effort to accommodate modern-day health concerns, has rendered the latter obsolete. 
 Back when Americans thought eating butter, prime steaks, heavy cream and Cheddar cheese were healthful pursuits, when they were appalled that someone had watered their cream and adulterated their ground beef with soy protein, the Federal Government established standardized recipes to define the permissible ingredients in a long list of food products including butter and cheese, sausages and canned chili.
Most of the standards were established before 1940, when people were more concerned with adulteration and economic deception than the hazards of a high-fat diet. How times have changed.
Now these "standards of identity," as they are called by Federal agencies, stand in the way of making nutritional improvements in processed food, according to a report released today by Public Voice for Food and Health Policy. The report from the group, a consumer-advocacy organization that is based in Washington, is called "No License to Label: How Federal Standards Restrict Lower-Fat Foods."
"From a public health perspective," the report said, "the most troublesome standards of identity are those that impede the development of lower-fat products."
That is because many standards require minimum fat levels. And any product that does not meet that minimum fat level is not allowed to use the traditional name for the product.
The group wants the Government to change food standard policies to make lower-fat products more readily available and to establish a uniform definition of words like light.
The Food and Drug Administration seems willing to comply. "The situation is not as bleak as Public Voice presents it," said F. Edward Scarbrough, acting director of nutrition and food sciences at the F.D.A. "We are interpreting the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act to have latitutde to establish new standards for foods with less fat," he said. The Act takes effect in 1993. The Department of Agriculture, responsible for meat and poultry products, said the regulations are under review.
Under existing standards, the innovator who produces a lower-fat product is faced with some unpleasant choices: defy the regulations, as some have done, and hope the Government looks the other way; call the product imitation, as in imitation cheese, or call it by some fanciful name, like Simple Pleasure, the frozen dessert made with a fat substitute instead of milk fat. Consumers might call Simple Pleasure ice cream, or nonfat ice cream, but its manufacturer cannot.
"Consumers," the report said, "are often confused by unfamiliar product names and tend to view the products as either synthetic or of lesser quality than standardized higher-fat products that are permitted to use the traditional name." That puts the innovator at a competitive disadvantage, the report said.
Butter must contain 80 percent milk fat to use the name. In 1990 there were two petitions before the F.D.A. One, from the American Butter Institute, asked the F.D.A. to permit the use of the term "light butter" for a product that contains 52 percent milk fat instead of 80 percent. Land O' Lakes Inc. makes such a product. Johann Farms also asked the F.D.A. for a new standard for "light butter," one that contained 35 to 40 percent milk fat.
The F.D.A. has not approved either petition. And, Public Voice said, "neither of the petitions warrants approval by F.D.A."
Butter, even with a reduction in milk fat to 39 percent, is hardly a "light" product. For many other products, manufacturers are free to use the term light because no regulations govern its use.
Earlier this month the F.D.A. told Land O' Lakes that if it didn't change the name of its product, the agency would take regulatory action, which could mean seizure.
Clearly consumers should be protected against misleading labeling like "light butter." But what benefit is it to consumers who are looking for lower-fat products not to have "butter" with less fat on the market?
It would make more sense for the F.D.A. to issue a permit that allows butter with less fat to be called "reduced-fat butter."
Now if the F.D.A. would enforce the law across the board. Even as it pursues light butter, the agency seems to be looking the other way at light and reduced-fat Cheddar, Monterey Jack and Muenster cheeses. Consumers are further confused by such inconsistencies.
Setting aside all the legal and technical mumbo jumbo involving standards, the consumer group makes a good case for broadening them.
Take mayonnaise, salad dressing (such as Miracle Whip) and French dressing. All have standards that require a certain amount of fat.
But for inexplicable reasons, there are no such standards for ranch-style dressing or Italian dressing. They can be marketed as light or reduced fat with their familiar name. Mayonnaise, salad dressing and French dressing cannot.
The problems are different at the Department of Agriculture, but the results are the same: few reduced-fat products. The department prohibits or strictly limits levels of ingredients like water, carbohydrates and vegetables that may be added to products as substitutes for fat.
But it permits amazing levels of skin and fat in processed meats. Many consumers would probably be surprised to learn that up to 25 percent of the content of boneless chicken breast can be skin, which is mostly fat. They would probably be horrified to learn that there is no limit to the amount of fat in what is considered meat.
Even when the standards require spaghetti with meat sauce to contain 12 percent meat, the so-called meat can be mostly fat. Which solves a mystery: why there never seems to be meat in canned spaghetti with meat sauce.
Until such time as nutritonal Nirvana arrives in the supermarket, the only recourse for shoppers is to get beyond the funny names, to ignore phrases like imitation, light, reduced fat and X percent less fat and go for the nutrition labeling panel where they can find the real skinny.
And if a product that purports to offer less of something or other has no nutrition labeling, perhaps it ought to grow stale on the shelf.

HEADLINE: Study Questions Routine Molar Removal

BYLINE: By SANDRA BLAKESLEE

 BODY:
AMERICAN dentists and oral surgeons are extracting far too many wisdom teeth, a new study suggests.
If surgeons removed only those wisdom teeth that actually caused problems, researchers say, the nation would save at least $150 million a year in medical expenses with no ill effects. And tens of thousands of people, mostly teen-agers, would be spared the aches, pains and complications that can result from the surgery. 
 As things stand now, teen-agers, especially those in families with dental insurance, lose their wisdom teeth by the time they reach college age, as a matter of routine.
 
Studying Medical Procedures
 The study is part of an expanding effort to identify ineffective or wasteful medical procedures. It was financed by the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, a new Federal agency, and conducted by Dr. Alexia Antczak, an assistant professor at the Harvard School of Public Health and School of Dental Medicine and Dr. Joan Tulloch, a professor in the Department of Orthodontics in the School of Dentistry at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
The nation's 6,000 oral surgeons extract 2.25 million wisdom teeth each year, according to the American Society of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons. General dentists probably take out many more than that, but no one is keeping track, Dr. Antczak said. Costs range from $70 to $175 per tooth, she said, not counting anesthesia or painkillers. Wisdom tooth extraction is the bread and butter of oral surgery, and some surgeons spend almost all their time on it.
Today, 9 out of 10 American teen-agers whose parents have insurance have their wisdom teeth removed, Dr. Antczak estimated. Oral surgeons say that it is easier to remove teeth in younger people because the roots are not formed and the bone is less dense, she said. They also say, "Let's do this before you go off your parents' insurance," she said.
But the researchers said that removing wisdom teeth because they might cause problems some day, as a matter of course, makes about as much sense as removing everyone's appendix just because some people develop appendicitis.
The wisdom of removing wisdom teeth has been a topic of contention for years. The practice was based on good intentions, Dr. Antczak said, "but there is now a strong economic incentive to keep it going."
But oral surgeons say there can be good reasons for removing widsom teeth that are not causing problems. Several studies have shown that older patients suffer more complications from the surgery, said Dr. Thomas Osborn, an oral surgeon in Birmingham, Mich., speaking for the American Society of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.
"Also, so many kids go through orthodontics and then the wisdom teeth come plowing in like pistons," he said. "There's real concern that some damage will be done to the orthodontia."
 
Most Third Molars Are Healthy
 Wisdom teeth, or third molars, generally erupt between the ages of 17 and 21, according to the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons in Rosemont, Ill. Most are healthy and can be an asset. About 28 percent become impacted, unable to move into their proper place, often because the jaw is not big enough to accommodate them. The teeth may grow sideways, break partway through the gum or remain trapped beneath gum and bone.
Many impacted teeth do not cause problems, Dr. Anczak said. But when they do, the problems can be serious. When food lodges in partly erupted teeth, infections and cysts can form, she said, damaging bone, neighboring teeth and nerves. In extremely rare instances, tumors can develop, leading to the loss of part of the jaw.
Anticipating such problems, Dr. Antczak said, many dentists and oral surgeons remove wisdom teeth as a preventive measure.
But is the surgery necessary? Most of the medical literature about wisdom teeth consists of anecdotes about particularly troublesome teeth, Dr. Antczak said. It is far from clear, she said, that removal in general saves more money and misery.
Because so many teen-agers have their wisdom teeth pulled, it is difficult to find enough adults to study wisdom tooth problems that might arise later in life, Dr. Antczak said. Instead, she studied the problem, using research methods that break down a medical decision, like opting for wisdom tooth removal, into its component parts, like cost, risk or side effects. Then each part is analyzed to see what role it plays in the overall decision.
She and Dr. Tulloch compared three hypothetical strategies: In one, all wisdom teeth are removed from all adolescents before roots are formed. In a second, only impacted wisdom teeth, including healthy impacted teeth, are removed. In the third stratgey, only those wisdom teeth that have become infected or troublesome are removed.
 
Method of Study
 Costs, surgical complications and "days of standard discomfort," a measure of pain, swelling, bruising and malaise, were compared in the three strategies. Complications include tingling nerves, infection, jaw spasms and painful sockets left in the bone after tooth extraction.
Universal extraction of wisdom teeth would cost more than $278 million and would result in three million days of misery for America's teen-agers, Dr. Antczak said. Removing only problem teeth would cost an estimated $51.5 million and create 776,000 days of misery. Removing impacted teeth falls in between.
Current practice makes the majority suffer to protect the minority who might run into trouble, Dr. Antczak said. She said a search of the medical literature turned up no data from other countries on what happens when wisdom teeth are left alone.
Dr. Osborn, who works closely with the oral surgery association, said his research showed that early removal had important benefits. A study, published in 1985 in the Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, examined 16,000 wisdom teeth extractions in three groups of patients with average ages of 19, 28 and 45. Most of the teeth were removed because they were nonfunctional, he said, but some were causing problems. The study showed that as patients got older, they suffered more complications from wisdom tooth surgery, Dr. Osborn said. Orthodontists also put pressure on oral surgeons to remove wisdom teeth to help keep teeth straight, Dr. Osborn said.
But Dr. Earl Rosenberg, a prominent Boston oral surgeon, said there was no evidence that wisdom teeth tend to ruin orthodontia.

Vertical Impaction
 Most wisdom teeth emerge from the gumto serve as useful molars, but about 28 percent are impacted, or unable to move into place.
 
Angular Impaction
 Most impacted wisdom teeth do not cause problems, either, a new study says, but some crowd their neighbors.
 
Horizontal Impaction
 Some impacted teeth damage surrounding tissue. Infections and cysts can frorm around partly erupted teeth; rarely, tumors form.

The second New York International Festival of the Arts lasted half as long as the first festival three years ago, cost $3 million less and had only a third as many events.
But judging by an informal sampling of festival administrators, presenters, performers and devoted -- albeit weary -- audience members, this year's version was more successful than the previous, mammoth undertaking, which drew almost as much criticism as applause. 
 "Particularly in a time when we're doing so much belt-tightening, the festival was very much a success," said Barbara J. Fife, Deputy Mayor for Planning and Development, who was the festival's liaison with Mayor David N. Dinkins. "I think it was good for New York. The timing was particularly good for us, because it was a clear statement that New York is a destination point for the arts."
The festival ended its 16-day run on Sunday night, although a few festival productions, like that of the State Theater of Lithuania, are continuing. The festival organizers had originally predicted that total attendance would be 300,000, and that 150,000 to 175,000 tickets would be sold to more than 60 performing-arts events from 23 countries at 28 sites.
The individual producers of each event have not yet forwarded ticket-sales statistics to the festival, but based on verbal reports, over-all attendance goals were achieved, festival organizers said. "I think that the audiences for artists and programs which had never been heard of before, by most New Yorkers, exceeded all of our expectations," said Martin E. Segal, chairman of the festival.
Among the sold-out events, according to the festival, were "Cole Porter's 100th Birthday Celebration," "Pongsan Masked-Dance Drama," "Immigrant Voices," "Miss Julie," "A Doll's House," Compagnie Philippe Saire, The Reduced Shakespeare Company, Olodum and Friends, "Muestra Espanola: La Fura dels Baus," Compagnie Philippe Genty and "Cricot 2: Tribute to Tadeusz Kantor."
No events were canceled after the festival began. "We didn't have any catastrophes of any kind, and we wound up in the black," Mr. Segal said. He meant that the $5.69 million cost of mounting the festival was more than covered by contributions from private sources.
The festival did not share in the box-office receipts from the events, which went to the individual producers. None of the money came from the Federal, state or city governments.
The general tenor of critical opinion has been that the festival was more selective in its artistic choices than in 1988, and that the productions, overall, were of higher artistic quality. For example, reviewers unanimously acclaimed the three productions directed by Ingmar Bergman that appeared at the Brooklyn Academy of Music: the United States premieres of his "Miss Julie," "A Doll's House" and "Long Day's Journey Into Night."
"In terms of audience demand, overall enthusiasm, and critical response, we've seen nothing like it here for years," said Peter B. Carzasty, a spokesman for the Brooklyn Academy of Music, which presented the Bergman imports.
"Immigrant Voices," a critically praised theatrical and musical evocation of the immigrant experience, was sold out on both of the nights that a Circle Line sightseeing boat delivered 750 passengers to Ellis Island.
Not every event sold out, though. "We're a little disappointed," said Bernard Gersten, executive producer of Lincoln Center Theater. In association with the Joyce Theater in Manhattan, it presented "Uncle Vanya " and "The Square," as performed by the State Theater of Lithuania. "We're under our box-office projections," he said, "but we hope to pick it up in the next couple of weeks. We're getting really good word of mouth." The company is performing at the Joyce until July 7.
 
A Sore Point: Tickets
 Most of the criticism of the current festival centered around the lack of availability of tickets to sought-after performances. This was especially true of the Cole Porter tribute, a one-night-only affair; the "Ascap Salute to Cabaret" at the Hotel Pierre, and the Bergman-directed dramas, whose cast members were unable to stay longer because they had prior commitments.
There were things that went wrong, too: for example, the opening night production of "Immigrant Voices" was delayed so that the audience in the Grand Registry Hall missed the full harbor fireworks display celebrating the return of the troops from the Middle East on June 10.
But if ticket scalpers' prices are any rough gauge of a festival's worth, the extravaganza was at times a stratospheric success. For example, the June 9 musical revue at Carnegie Hall celebrating the 100th anniversary of Cole Porter's birth, found scalpers selling $100 tickets for $250. Tickets for "Miss Julie" and "A Doll's House" went for as much as $150 from scalpers outside the door.
 
A Boost to the Economy
 Tickets to other events weren't scalped, but were in great demand nevertheless. "We never expected that our entire run would sell out," said Reed Martin, one of the three members of the Reduced Shakespeare Company comedy troupe. "And thanks to the festival, we've got another booking in New York, and we're coming back next year."
Mr. Segal said preliminary estimates showed that the festival had a positive economic impact on the city. "We're going to be completing analyses that will calculate the secondary financial effect on the city in regard to tourism, hotel occupancy, restaurants, things like that."
The original plan was to have a festival every two years, but Mr. Segal let three years lapse after the last festival "to take enough time to adequately appraise the first festival," he said.
"Another festival in two years is a possibility," Mr. Segal added. On Sunday night, the festival had its wrap-up party, attended by a polyglot gaggle of several hundred performers, producers and staff members who gathered at Laura Belle, the Manhattan night club. "We thank you all for what the festival has been, and what it will be in the future," said Mr. Segal.
What the festival organizers hope it will be, in the future, is a predictable feature of Manhattan's cultural life. "The idea that this can be a recurring event is a really good one," said Ms. Fife, the deputy mayor. "If we institutionalize it in alternate years, it will develop a following and audience and a presence in other countries, so that they will begin to plan on coming here."

HEADLINE: The Poorest Americans;
A Bold -- Flawed -- Remedy for Children

SERIES: First of two editorials

 BODY:
Six words stand out from the 30 months of work and 390 pages of report just issued by the bipartisan National Commission on Children: "Today, children are the poorest Americans." Of all the obstacles and miseries the commission addressed, the highest priority attaches to the fact that one of every five children lives in poverty. It's a shaming fact, one that calls for a bold response, and the commission gives one. It proposes a dramatic tax credit worth $1,000 for every child.
The commission, headed by Senator John D. Rockefeller 4th, also calls for health insurance for all pregnant women and children, a test of child support insurance and other programs. 
 But the unquestioned centerpiece is the proposed $40 billion-a-year tax credit, which would help poor children especially but go to all families. The commission thus makes its recommendation prohibitively -- and unnecessarily -- expensive. Fortunately, there is a way to restructure the credit and open the way for Congress to embrace it.
The commission's child tax credit would lower every family's taxes by $1,000 per child. The cost would be offset in part by eliminating the personal deduction. The net impact would be highly progressive: A family in the 15 percent tax bracket would save almost $700 per child; a family in the 31 percent bracket about $300. The credit would be refundable; families too poor to pay taxes would receive $1,000 per child in cash.
The proposal is similar to one proposed by two Democrats, Thomas Downey and Al Gore, to provide an $800-per-child tax credit and pay for it by raising the top tax rate from 33 to nearly 40 percent.
Congress would undoubtedly pay for a child tax credit along some such lines, soaking the rich. That would be fine, if the shift in tax burdens would stick. But that isn't likely. Congress would probably couple a boost in the top tax rate with lower taxes on capital gains and reinstatement of wasteful tax shelters. In the end, few citizens' tax burdens would change much. The tax code, however, would be wrecked and the economy damaged.
There is a way out. Two analysts at the Urban Institute, Eugene Steuerle and Jason Juffras, propose paying for a $1,000-per-child tax credit by trimming welfare payments and benefits for non-disabled children of Social Security retirees -- aid that would duplicate the new credit. They would keep the top tax rate at 34 percent, rather than let it drop as scheduled after 1995, and would raise excise taxes to levels prevailing in the early 1980's.
This package solves a number of interrelated problems. At present, welfare parents who marry or go back to work lose benefits. But by relying on tax credits, the Steuerle-Juffras plan would provide substantial relief to poor families without discouraging work or marriage. And by keeping income tax rates at current levels, their plan offers no reason to meddle with the tax code.
The Rockefeller Commission report swims in platitudes ("We recommend that parents be more vigilant and aggressive guardians of their children's moral development . . ."). Its strategy, of trying to appeal to a large swath of the public, won't work once Congress is forced to face up to the cost. The answer is to preserve the tax credit, but to pay for it along the lines of the Steuerle-Juffras plan.
Next: Poor children need more than money.

HEADLINE: The New York Bloc

BYLINE: By James Rouen; James Rouen, who practices international law, was an assistant for economic development in the Mayor's office and a municipal bond lawyer.

 BODY:
While the privatization of city services is one of the hottest topcs in municipal finance, the privatization of the Florida prison system and the Fort Worth Zoo is dwarfed by the return to private hands of the enterprises of half of Europe. The experience of those who've returned from trying to privatize Eastern Europe's industrial base may offer useful insights -- or at least a bit of perspective -- to those hoping to privatize city services in the U.S.
The Eastern Europeans have found that creating a new system of controls and incentives to replace old patterns of direction and command is time consuming and leaves little room for error. As one Polish commentator has observed, it's easy to make an aquarium into fish soup but hard to go in the opposite direction. 
 When I worked for the Koch administration in the early 80's, it struck me that many criticisms of the Communist system were also leveled at us -- and with some justification. Municipal government too often shows little concern for the consumers of its services. And the time needed to change bureaucratic procedures, like the time needed to create the Himalayas, is measured in geologic terms.
If you want to understand how Soviet agriculture works, take a morning off to get your driver's license from the Department of Motor Vehicles. Two hours and three lines later, you will have it, and your photograph will look as if it was taken off the reflection on a dented hub cap.
There are at least three areas where the problems of privatizing Eastern Europe and American municipal services appear to converge:
* Accounting. One of Ronald Lauder's 10 commandments for doing business in Eastern Europe is, "Thou shalt believe no numbers except those provided by Western auditors."
But the problem is even deeper. The financial accounts of the American municipality and Communist state enterprise are remarkably similar: Neither one provides information that is especially useful to a private owner. The city agency and the state enterprise use "fund accounting," which is supposed to show compliance with legal and social mandates, not profits and losses.
For example, an American city's highway trust fund is intended to show that state and Federal requirements are being met; gas tax receipts and road building expenditures will be reported. But the accounts will not show depreciation, even when motorists fall through bridges.
Notice the striking similarity between the backward Eastern European industrial base and the crumbling American urban infrastructure. In neither case will the balance sheet tell you the value of what you are buying, or the cost to put it right.
In Poland, fixed assets are valued by taking their 1945 value and multiplying by 46 years of inflation. Similarly, parts of the New York City water system, constructed in 1841, are valued by their historical cost.
* Employment. You cannot go east of the Elbe without noticing the immense overstaffing. A client who bought into a Hungarian steel mill told me that its workforce was three times that of a comparable mill in the West; this ratio appears to be typical.
Many American public services and Eastern European enterprises are uneconomic because they have burdened themselves with excess labor and pension costs. Many enterprises cannot be privatized until those burdens have been removed, by bankruptcy or closure, at great political cost.
* Unexpected claims. In the East, many businesses carry hidden claims: owners who want to recover what was expropriated by the Communists, state employees whose "equity" was recognized at least in theory by socialist law, and the public at large, which often expects to receive its "share" of anything privatized.
While these claims are absent in an American municipal privatization, the principle remains: there are hidden parties with expectations you will inherit. Public employees and their dependents are accustomed to a certain level of pay, benefits and performance. And many citizens will object to any change in service or pricing. They can't complain if General Motors raises its prices, but if a highway toll rises, it's World War III. So it is essential to analyze any proposed privatization to see what improvements and changes will make it work, and to scout around for hidden parties with a perceived right to maintaining the status quo.
Not only will there be strangers at the dinner table -- there may be more of them than you think.

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
A Nuclear Ripoff?

BYLINE: By LESLIE H. GELB

 BODY:
Even as the Administration moves to cut the nuclear weapons stockpile almost in half, Congress continues to vote billions annually to fund nuclear warheads programs. The program exceeds $7 billion, when the White House and Congressional leaders are saying they have no new money for children and cities.
 And at the very time when extra Energy Department dollars should be going to clean up the dangerous pollution from past nuclear weapons production, a pivotal Senate subcommittee has taken $108 million away from cleanup programs and added these funds to weapons research and development programs already exceeding $2 billion. 
 To be sure, substantial sums are necessary to design new warheads, maintain production facilities, insure safety and hold onto scientific talent. But in the small community that follows these intricate affairs, the feeling mounts that perhaps billions are being squandered in what amounts to a full employment program for the nuclear weapons laboratories.
These labs, like many old cold war institutions, are scrambling to find new justifications to live and spend in the old cold war style. Lab leaders are particularly well connected in Congress to powerful figures like Senator Pete Domenici, the top Republican on the Appropriations Committee, who knows how to protect New Mexico's weapons-making jewels in Los Alamos and Sandia.
 Even a little probing will show that neither these legislators, nor many Pentagon officials (who determine nuclear warhead requirements) or key Department of Energy officials (in whose budget all these monies reside), have a clear picture of how these billions of dollars are being spent or why.
 The U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile now totals about 20,000 missile warheads and bombs. The Joint Chiefs of Staff project reductions to about 12,000 -- not counting further cuts from arms control treaties under negotiation with Moscow. That decline alone should be driving operation and maintenance costs way down, but the budget reveals no dramatic savings.
 In years past the Energy and Defense Departments designed about 10 new warheads at any one time. Now about two new ones are under development. Yet the number of lab personnel is down by only about 20 percent from cold war highs. And the labs continue to resist designing standard warhead models to fit any new weapon. As John Tuck, a senior Energy Department official, told me, "Building each warhead uniquely has meant much greater expense than necessary."
 The Pentagon, he added, has "no hesitancy" about paying the extra bill since it is an Energy Department expenditure. "We are the small tip of a tail of a big dog," he explained. But Pentagon officials say they are not sure what the Energy Department and labs do with the money.
 To read the report of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development does not clarify much. The subcommittee added nuclear cleanup funds to the Administration's relatively small request, but not as much as its House counterpart. Instead, it shifted over $100 million from environmental management to an already hefty post-cold-war R & D effort.
 One subcommittee justification was "weapons safety," without citing how many hundreds of millions are already devoted to that task. Another was to maintain "strong" labs without discussing how big and strong the labs need to be when new warhead development is sharply decreasing. The labs eat up a fortune in "overhead," and no one seems confident what that means.
 The third, and juiciest, justification is "new opportunities for strengthening [lab] support of generic precompetitive technology research deemed critical to future U.S. economic competitiveness." Translated, that means Federal help for private industry. But the report does not cite specific technologies or suggest what nuclear weapons labs might know about civilian market needs. It also fails to consider the risks of potential "nuclear mercenaries" spreading valuable nuclear weapons technologies to private enterprise.
 The weapons labs are understandably eager to divine new missions and bolster old ones. But billions of tax dollars are at stake, and it is far from clear that the Administration and Congress have taken a hard look at what is going on.

HEADLINE: High-Tech Medicine Pays Physicians Best;
'A Killing on AIDS'

 BODY:
To the Editor:
You sound a necessary alarm about the growing practice of physicians referring patients to health-care facilities in which they have a financial interest (front page, June 2). However, you overlooked an area of health care in which this practice is extensive and expensive: home infusion therapy, particularly for AIDS patients. 
 Infusion therapy -- medications and nutrients delivered intravenously or through feeding tubes -- used to be available only in hospitals. But since the early 1980's, these treatments increasingly have been provided to acquired immune deficiency syndrome patients in their homes, enabling them to avoid costly and debilitating hospital stays.
But as home infusion companies began to compete for patients, they offered physicians financial incentives to refer patients to them. As documented in our recent report, "Making a Killing on AIDS: Home Health Care and Pentamidine," these deals include limited partnerships, stock options and clinical consulting fees. Especially in those cases when physicians provide the home infusion treatments, the potential exists for overuse because the doctor has an incentive to perform more procedures than are necessary. Such arrangements elevate physician profits over patient care.
Take the example of T2 Medical, a Georgia-based national home-infusion company with local offices in New York City and on Long Island. T2's partnerships with physicians enrich doctors and help the company enjoy 50 percent gross profit margins, but they inflate the cost of patient care. Cytovene, a drug that prevents virally induced blindness in AIDS patients, costs $4,000 for two weeks when provided by T2 in Atlanta; a local competitor charges $1,100.
To protect vulnerable people with AIDS, and to curb health care inflation, Congress should prohibit by law physician partnerships in infusion companies, and indeed, in all health-care facilities. Such conflicts of interest are medically and morally offensive.

HEADLINE: Why Bridgeport Had To File for Bankruptcy

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Needless Bankruptcy in Bridgeport" (editorial, June 14) observes that bankruptcy should not provide an easy alternative to municipal deficits, but should be resorted to only when all else fails. Unfortunately, you fail to note that protective legislation pending in the Connecticut Legislature would have precluded Bridgeport from filing for bankruptcy. Political observers believed that such legislation would have been passed on the final day of the Legislature's regular session, and if the option were ever to be available, it had to be exercised before such enactment. More than 35 states now preclude such a filing without state consent. 
 Mayor Mary Moran evaluated the bankruptcy option with her closest advisers for many months and filed only when it appeared there would be no assistance from labor, state or Federal sources. Bridgeport's tax rate, already the highest effective tax rate in the state, would have increased by 18 percent this year and 25 percent more the following year. A tax rate of that magnitude would have made the city an economic catastrophe and incapable of competing for new development. Bankruptcy was Mayor Moran's reluctant last resort and, it is to be hoped, will spur a full and fair reorganization for Bridgeport.

HEADLINE: 600 Hasidim May Be Evicted From Suburban Enclave

BYLINE: By JAMES FERON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEDFORD, N.Y., June 25

 BODY:
Malka Taub, a mother of 10, moved with her family from the Borough Park section of Brooklyn 11 years ago to help establish a yeshiva in this heavily wooded suburb of northern Westchester, escaping what she remembered was a "rough city."
 Now, with 600 others -- faculty members and students of the K'Hal Adas Kashau yeshiva and their families -- Mrs. Taub faces eviction from this 169-acre site that has been transformed into a Hasidic enclave, because the yeshiva failed to meet its mortgage payments. 
I'm very nervous and upset," she said. "I can't pick myself up and go back. I want to raise my children here, not exposing them to drugs and problems in the city." But that may be her destination after the City of New York offers the site at auction at 10 A.M. on July 17 in the lobby of the courthouse in White Plains.
 
Rabbi Blames New York City
 It will be the fourth attempt in 15 years to sell the property, which was built as a turn-of-the-century tuberculosis sanatorium for Montefiore Hospital and converted to a home for delinquent boys in the 1920's. The city tried to auction it off in 1977 but nobody wanted it for $3.5 million or for $2.754 million, the minimum bids set by the city. At the third auction in 1977, it was sold for $1.625 million to the yeshiva, the only bidder.
 A few days later, said Rabbi Abraham Blum, the Hasidic community's leader, the city, in an effort to economize, shut down the main boiler and removed the security force guarding the 16 buildings on the property. They were quickly vandalized, with thousands of window panes broken and copper gutters removed.
 That left the buildings vulnerable to rain damage, which remains as vivid today as it was a decade ago, as does the dispute between New York City and the yeshiva over who should bear the cost and responsibility for the repairs.
 Throughout years of disputes in the courts, the yeshiva has taught Jewish religious law and traditions to students who Rabbi Blum said were "anywhere from 16 and 17 years old to 30 or 40, some married with their own families." It also has a full range of classes for the younger children of religious students and faculty members.
 Classes are continuing despite the possible eviction, the rabbi said.
 The yeshiva made only two payments to the city, at the auction and at the closing, each amounting to $162,500, or 10 percent of the purchase price. It has sought to have the city declared responsible for the repair costs.
 
$1 Million in Repairs Cited
 "We have spent more than $1 million, or nearly the cost of buying the site, to repair the damage caused by the city's abrupt removal of its security force," Rabbi Blum said.
 But in 1979, the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court upheld a lower court ruling that the yeshiva could not recover money from the city because it had failed to file an official complaint within the necessary 30 days after the auction.
 Andrea Roschelle, an assistant corporation counsel for New York City, said, "We've tried to settle with them many times and finally obtained a judgment of about $2 million plus interest; the total due us is in excess of $3 million."
 "We've bent over backwards but it only leads to protracted negotiations," she said. "In the meantime they haven't paid a penny." The property was returned to the city by Justice Vincent Gurahian of State Supreme Court in 1988 after eight years of foreclosure proceedings.
 
'Adding Insult to Injury'
 Rabbi Blum said that city's position reminded him of a phrase in I Kings 21;19: "Hast thou killed, and also taken possession?" He said this was "adding insult to injury, to a higher level."
 The yeshiva residents keep to themselves, shopping in Bedford stores but not socializing in the village. Miriam Blum, a resident for 13 years, said: "The police never have to come, we don't use the parks, we strive to stick to our traditions of a very modest life."
 Despite its separateness, the yeshiva has had some conflicts with neighbors. When it built a cemetery on yeshiva property, neighbors said the Hasidim bulldozed property outside its borders during the construction. This month, the yeshiva was charged by New York City with operating a faulty waste-water treatment plant.
 In the yeshiva kitchen, Jesus Rivera, an employee of six years, said, "New York City is right, but where will all the families go?"
 He said he was convinced that the dispute would be resolved. "I'm a man of faith," he said. "I believe in miracles."

 CORRECTION:
Articles published Wednesday and on June 26 about a yeshiva in Bedford, N.Y., referred incorrectly to an earlier occupant of the site. It was a home for dependent and neglected children that was known as Hillcrest, not a home for delinquent boys, according to a former director.

HEADLINE: Spending for 1988 Campaigns Set a Record

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 26

 BODY:
Spending at the local, state and Federal levels in the 1988 political campaigns reached an all-time high of $2.7 billion, an analysis of the campaign made public today has found.
But at a news conference here, Herbert E. Alexander, an author of the analysis and a political science professor at the University of Southern California, argued that the trouble with how campaigns are financed is not the overall cost but where the money comes from. His view differs from that of many advocates of changing the way campaigns are paid for, who argue that the rising costs of seeking and staying in office are out of control. 
 "The fact is," Mr. Alexander said, "while $2.7 billion sounds like a lot, it is about the same as the two leading advertisers, Procter & Gamble, and Philip Morris, spent in 1987."
Mr. Alexander said the limits on spending by Presidential candidates are meaningless because campaigns find back-door means to help their drives, including efforts by state parties to increase voter participation, which benefit the party's candidates.
"The chicanery, the illusion is saying that you have to have expenditure limits," Mr. Alexander said, "All you're doing is crippling the candidate."
Mr. Alexander, who is director of the Citizens' Research Foundation, a private group that studies that role of money in politics, wrote the book "Financing the 1988 Election" with Monica Bauer, an assistant professor of government at Western New England College.
The book found that almost two-thirds of the $2.7 billion, or $1.6 billion was spent on campaigns for President and Congress. The total was a 50 percent increase over the nearly $1.8 billion in spending in the 1984 campaigns, when a President was also elected.
Mr. Alexander said a major reason for the higher spending in 1988 was not only inflation but also the increased use of technology in campaigns and the fact that the Presidential race drew so many contenders on the Democratic and Republican side because there was no incumbent running.
Of the $2.7 billion spent, the analysis found, $500 million was for Presidential campaigns. That included money spent in the primary and general elections as well as direct spending by national parties on behalf of their nominees. Of that, an estimated $233.5 million was spent by or on behalf of candidates seeking the nomination; $42.1 million on the two major party conventions, and $28.3 million in the general election.
The $500 million does include roughly $43 million in money that is not federally regulated that was collected to help the Presidential candidates even though it was not donated to their campaigns directly. It also does not include spending by political action committees that were established by some candidates.
An even larger share, $540 million, was spent on campaigns for state office such as governor and state legislator, plus another $365 million for campaigns for county and municipal employees.
Another $457.7 million was spent by all candidates for Congress; $328.3 million by the national party committees on costs not including direct donations to campaigns; $224 million by political action committees and other groups not directly linked to the parties; $87.5 million by state and local party committees, and $225 million on campaigns supporting or opposing local ballot propositions.
The book also found that President Bush's campaign spent more to buy advertising time than the campaign of Michael S. Dukakis, the Democratic nominee who was Governor of Massachusetts. Not counting many of the production costs, the Bush campaign spent $31.4 million on advertising, while the Dukakis campaign spent $23.5 million.
Mr. Alexander, whose book is the eighth in a series on financing campaigns, predicted that far less money will be spent in the 1992 Presidential race because there is essentially no contest on the Republican side.
"Spending in 1992 will be more like in 1984," he said. "Even the Democrats' spending will be down because they're getting a late start."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Has Broad Decline; Gold Rises in New York

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar declined yesterday amid speculation that interest rates would rise in Germany. The Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, is expected to raise rates in hopes of cooling inflation, analysts said.
Gold rose $1.30 on the Commodity Exchange in New York, closing at $365.90 an ounce. Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of $366.00, up $1.75. 
 The dollar tends to fall when interest rates rise in another country, as emand increases for investments denominated in that country's currency. Other currencies also traded lower against the German mark.
John McCarthy, chief dealer with Algemene Bank Nederland in New York, said the dollar traded within a narrow range, from 1.7800 to 1.8150 marks. He said the foreign exchange markets were thinning out as traders began to take their summer vacations.
The dollar fell to 1.78725 marks in New York from late Tuesday's 1.7935. In earlier European trading, it fell to 1.7840 German marks from 1.7965.
The mark also advanced against other currencies, particularly the Japanese yen. Cross trading, deals involving the other currencies, also helped depress the dollar, analysts said.
Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, testified before Congress yesterday, telling lawmakers the Fed was spending a significant amount of its time wrestling with the country's credit crunch. Mr. McCarthy said, however, that Mr. Greenspan's appearance had little effect on the dollar.
Analysts also said the Government's latest report on the gross national product's peformance in the first quarter did not affect trading. The Commerce Department said the G.N.P. fell at an annual rate of 2.8 percent, weaker than an earlier 2.6 percent estimate.
The British pound gained against the dollar, rising to $1.6385 in New York from $1.6310 late Tuesday. Earlier in London, sterling rose to $1.6390 from $1.6280.
The dollar slipped to 138.275 yen in New York, from 138.30 Tuesday. In Tokyo overnight, the dollar rose to a closing 138.53 yen, from 138.38 yen at Tuesday's close, and in London, it fell to 138.40 yen.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday's quotes, included: 1.5475 Swiss francs, down from 1.5498; 6.0685 French francs, down from 6.0890; 1,332.75 Italian lire, down from 1,335.00; and 1.14215 Canadian dollars, up from 1.14195.

HEADLINE: U.S. VOICES REGRET ON YUGOSLAV CRISIS

BYLINE: By DAVID BINDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 26

 BODY:
The Bush Administration expressed regret today that Croatia and Slovenia had announced moves toward secession from Yugoslavia and declared that the United States would ignore those "unilateral steps" in future dealings with the country.
In statements by Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, and Margaret D. Tutwiler, the State Department spokeswoman, the Administration said it believed there were "still opportunities for compromise" among the contesting forces in Yugoslavia. 
 President Bush, saying the United States position on Yugoslavia's unity was very clear, said this afternoon: "What we don't need is more violence in the world. We do need some more peace and tranquility and people sitting down and talking about their differences." He commented during a picture-taking session at the White House.
"Instability and the breakup of Yugoslavia could have some very tragic consequences," Mr. Fitzwater said at his regular briefing, adding, "The United States still believes that there are opportunities for compromise within Yugoslavia acceptable to all six republics."
Reiterating the United States policy that despite the declarations of independence on Tuesday, Yugoslav unity is of utmost importance, the spokesman said, "We believe it is a union, that it is best maintained in that state, that it can achieve its economic growth better in that situation."
Citing Prime Minister Ante Markovic of Yugoslavia by name, Mr. Fitzwater said the United States supported his efforts "to preserve the unity of his country."
At the State Department, Miss Tutwiler read a statement prepared by policymakers saying: "We regret that the Croatian and Slovenian republics made unilateral assertions of independence from Yugoslavia."

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Yugoslavia Moves Upset Banks
 LONDON, June 26 (Reuters) -- Declarations of independence by Slovenia and Croatia unsettled bankers today and set off a sharp fall in the price of Yugoslavia's foreign debt traded on international markets.
"It's looking pretty sick," said a trader at a British merchant bank. "But the truth is there isn't a lot of business going through."
The price of Yugoslav debt slumped 3 3/4 points and was bid at 34 3/4 percent of face value after the news. Some dealers said the rate was likely to fall further in the near term.

HEADLINE: Reporter's Notebook;
In Hartford Tax Talks, Calm Reigns

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, June 26

 BODY:
Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. has repeatedly warned Connecticut lawmakers that if they fail to pass a budget by Sunday at midnight, when the next fiscal year begins, much of the state government will come to a grinding halt. Sometimes he clasps his hands in front of him when he says it, as though in prayer. Other times he hitches up his pants, in an apparent gesture of assertive bluster.
But even Mr. Weicker's theatrics seem unable to break the calm -- verging on paralysis -- that has settled over the Capitol. The special legislative session that many had expected would be filled with shouted debates, angry demonstrations and passionate public protests about Mr. Weicker's proposed income tax has produced nothing of the kind. 
 Even though most lawmakers seem to agree that the state is facing a historic crisis in its budget, and a historic crossroads as well in deciding whether the crisis will be resolved with a long-avoided income tax, the realizations appear to have numbed people more than anything else. Mr. Weicker proposed his income tax plan in February as the only option to resolve the fiscal crisis and stimulate the economy, then last month he vetoed the Legislature's alternative budget, which had no income tax, forcing the special session.
"It's not high anxiety, which is something you would expect at this point," said James J. Finley Jr., chief lobbyist for the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities, and a 10-year veteran under the gold-leafed Capitol dome. Mr. Finley said he believes some lawmakers are pushing the brink with ice-water in their veins, while others have simply been frozen already.
Issues of personality -- specifically antagonism toward Mr. Weicker and his sometimes imperious style -- add the spice.
"There's going to have to be some compromise," said Representative John Wayne Fox, an anti-income tax Democrat from Stamford. "There's going to have to be a situation where it isn't just the governor sitting back and saying, 'I'm right, you're wrong. Do what I tell you."
 
Insider's Paradise
 Listen carefully. It's the sound of a closing door.
From the Governor's office to the legislative office building to Senate Majority Leader Cornelius O'Leary's living room in Windsor Locks on one rainy day last week, most of the business of government has been conducted out of sight and sound. And that's exactly how many lawmakers want it, especially the select group of 20 to 25 moderate Democrats in the House and Senate who are being courted by both those favoring the income tax and those opposed.
Like a rumor on Wall Street that sets off a bidding war, the latest word on lawmakers and their leanings on the income tax question has become inside information. Mr. Weicker's office has gone so far as to refuse to release the list of people who have been filing one-by-one into the executive chamber for persuasion on the matter. The daily count of votes for an income tax is issued after a day's horsetrading like the closing figures of the Dow Industrial Average.
Today's House count: about 60 in majority Democratic caucus, up about 5 from Tuesday's close. Passage of a budget requires 76 total votes in the 151-member House and Democrats have said they would need five to 10 Republican votes.
Today's Senate count: roughly 14 to 17 votes for some kind of income tax, unchanged from Tuesday's close. At least 18 firm votes are considered crucial for passage with all 36 Senators present. That would result in a tie, with Lieutenant Governor Eunice S. Groark casting the deciding vote.
 
Honeymoon From Hell
 Honeymoon watch: Senator Stephen R. Somma, a Republican from Waterbury who opposes the income tax, left this week for a honeymoon in Bermuda. Mr. Somma said last week before his departure that, much to his new bride's dismay, he would fly back to vote against the income tax if he could get sufficient notice to make the connections. Getting generous notice, however, would also depend on the majority Democrats who are trying to pass an income tax package over Mr. Somma's objections.
 
Thanks, but No Thanks
 Meanwhile, lawmakers remain less than impressed with the Governor's efforts to win them over. A former Republican, Mr. Weicker was elected last year as a third-party governor with no party allies in the Legislature, and no control over the traditional means by which party members are brought into line. He has reportedly offered to campaign on behalf of some lawmakers, but with the Governor's image now so closely linked to the income tax, a Weicker campaign appearances offers little allure.
Representative Richard T. Mulready, a pro-income tax Democrat from West Hartford, said he had talked with one colleague who was offered that plum and apparently wanted no part of it. "I said you should have got him to go out and campaign against you," Mr. Mulready said.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "The Budget Battles"
 
New York
 
New York City: The City Council began drafting its own version of the budget to increase pressure on the Mayor and municipal unions.
The Dinkins administration escalated its campaign against the Council's proposed economies -- making public a list of the cuts and belittling many of them as unlawful or counterproductive. Jockeying for parity, the Council pressed for more discretion over spending.
 The Mayor and Council leaders decided against going back to Albany today without any agreement between them on how much to raise property taxes or with the unions on givebacks and other savings. Both agreements were deemed pivotal to the State Senate's approval of more state aid and a city income-tax increase.
 
Albany: Bargaining to restore some of the spending vetoed by the Governor was driven by New York City's budget deadline and by the Legislature's rush to adjourn, but neither was enough to get anybody off the dime.
Legislative leaders insisted, though, that the budget they approved earlier this month was balanced.
 
Connecticut
 Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. vowed to shut down all non-essential state services at midnight Sunday if lawmakers cannot agree on a budget he considers acceptable. The House Speaker, Richard J. Balducci, met with legislators to win converts for an income tax.
 
New Jersey
 The Florio Administration drafted plans for at least 4,000 additional layoffs to save up to $125 million. Senate Democrats predicted that layoffs would be necessary but expressed hope that the number would be smaller. Negotiations with unions on alternatives to the layoffs broke off last week.
The Senate President, John A. Lynch, criticized fellow Democrats in the Assembly for their budget proposal, which includes no layoffs. Assembly Democrats hope to protect the state's 70,000 unionized workers, many of whom live in districts represented by key legislators. -- June 27, 1991

HEADLINE: Housing Earmarked for the Poor Is Enriching Big Investors Instead

SERIES: Vanishing Homes: Second of two articles.

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS

 BODY:
A Federal program of housing for the poor is turning into profits for big real estate investors, led by one of America's business giants, the General Electric Company.
General Electric is about to become the biggest buyer under a Federal program in which nearly 500 apartment complexes taken over from failed savings and loan institutions are being sold by the Resolution Trust Corporation at discount prices to investors who agree to set aside 35 percent of the units for low-income families. 
 In real estate circles, all eyes are drawn to the G.E. deal. The company's financial and investment arm, the General Electric Capital Corporation, has agreed to buy 28 complexes with a total of 5,959 units in four Texas cities and six cities outside Texas -- at a price estimated at nearly 50 percent of market value.
 
Mandated by Congress
 Such discounts are meant to encourage sales of apartment complexes with limited rent controls under an affordable-housing program, mandated by Congress two years ago, to provide apartments and houses at prices the working poor can afford and without requiring the Government to pay for public housing.
In fact, in the portion of the program involving single-family homes, relatively few residences appear to have gone to the poor. But in the separate apartment program, a further complication emerges. Big investors, including General Electric, have figured out ways to obtain whole complexes and make hefty profits by adhering to the letter, if not the spirit, of the new law.
Critics contend that the Government is selling far more of its apartment complexes to for-profit investors than to nonprofit organizations whose primary mission is to help provide proper housing for the poor.
Moreover, they say, a plan by General Electric and other large buyers to lump the low-income units together and segregate them from the rest will inevitably create slums of the future.
Resolution Trust denies it is discriminating against lower-income groups in the apartment sales but it also says it has a duty to realize as much money within the bounds of the law as possible to minimize the costs of the savings and loan bailout.
The General Electric purchase, seen by investors as the model for future deals with Resolution Trust, is part of the first major package of apartments put out for bid under the agency's affordable-housing program. The package has 193 Texas apartment complexes, built originally by private developers and foreclosed on by the Government.
 
Going to Large Buyers
 Of that batch, more than 100 received no bids, and the largest number of the rest are being sold in bulk to large buyers, whom the trust corporation declines to identify. A number of other complexes, some too small to attract big investors, are being purchased by nonprofit agencies.
With a cost estimated at $75 million, the General Electric deal is the largest real estate transaction negotiated by the trust corporation not only in the affordable-housing program, but in sales of all property taken over in the savings and loan crisis. It exceeds the $65 million sale in March of a Palm Springs hotel to a group of Japanese investors and the $44 million sale of the Centrust building in Miami last month.
By agreeing to set aside apartments for low-income tenants and by buying in bulk, General Electric gets 40 to 50 percent taken off the purchase price -- a far steeper discount than General Electric would have received if it had bought the same complexes outside the trust corporation's affordable-housing program. This discount reduces the amount the Government will get back to trim the costs of the savings and loan bailout.
 
The Critics
Segregating The Poor
 Advocates of low-income housing contend that the General Electric arrangement is not socially sound or, in the long run, economically beneficial to the taxpayer.
They say the company's plan to segregate -- "aggregate" in real estate parlance -- poor residents into a few of the complexes miles away from the others runs counter to the policy goal of mixing low-income families with other income levels in the same complexes to provide what is regarded as a generally healthier community mix.
"The big players are making some great real estate deals, and in five years what they will have done for affordable housing is zilch," said James Ervin, a consultant to the Volunteers of America, one of the nation's largest nonprofit corporations. "This loophole allows private developers to sneak to the front of the line, pull out the cream properties, throw the rest back and create new slums."
Charles B. Gough, a consultant to the Dallas Housing Authority, said: "I don't believe aggregating affordable-housing tenants is the intent of the law."
 
G.E. Defends Proposal
 General Electric and the trust corporation disagree, contending the plan is both necessary and legal. Brown Thurman, a G.E. special projects manager who represented the company in the transaction, said: "The R.T.C. needs to have flexibility, or I won't bid. I will provide housing for the low income, but don't tie my hands. We're here to make a profit. If you restrict me as to what I can do and cannot do, I may or may not want to play."
Stephen S. Allen, head of the trust corporation's affordable-housing program, agreed on the importance of flexibility and aggregation.
"Aggregation," he said, "is permitted in the law. We'll be at this forever if we sell assets one by one. Our goal is to get a range of services to sell in bulk."
Yet the law permits only the big buyers to "aggregate." Buyers of just one apartment complex are specifically required to scatter low-income tenants throughout all buildings in that complex and not relegate them to a single building. The ability to aggregate was specifically put into the law to entice large private investors to buy properties in bulk to help move Resolution Trust's assets quickly, Mr. Allen said.
 
An Excellent Return
 Based on the numbers, Texas real estate experts said General Electric could expect an annual operating return of 13 to 15 percent under current market conditions -- a return regarded as excellent in the current market.
This compares with the return of 8 percent to 10 percent investors are receiving on similar apartment complexes bought without the large discount. Should rents rise, G.E. could earn as much as 15 to 18 percent.
Under aggregation, a buyer can quickly sell the complexes unencumbered by rent controls to another buyer for an immediate profit. In G.E.'s case, the company may further reduce its commitment to low-income housing and improve its return through a plan to sell the rent-controlled complexes to a nonprofit agency, which is trying to raise about $27.6 million to buy the units from G.E.
One of the reasons General Electric is able to bid on this deal is that it is a sophisticated, well-capitalized company with deep pockets. Resolution Trust is providing seller financing for many of its commercial properties but so far little in the affordable-housing program. In the Texas package, it accepted only all-cash offers. The net effect, according to Mr. Thurman of G.E., is that "only those with money can play."
 
Obstacles
Tough Going For Agencies
 Though Resolution Trust says it is working to improve the program, the nonprofit groups say that doing business with it has thus far been tough going, indeed. Of the few nonprofit groups that have managed to buy in, many have found that the agency has driven such hard financial bargains that they cannot fill their units with the extremely poor, as they would like, and still cover their debts.
"You can't house the homeless and pay a mortgage," said Louis Kurtz, housing development director at the Austin-Travis County Mental Health Center, which has purchased two small properties. "If the R.T.C. were committed to housing the homeless, that would be reflected in the purchase price."
Mr. Gough, the consultant, is currently bidding on a 280-unit complex and a 296-unit complex for the Dallas Housing Authority. He said he would like to fill his units with more than 35 percent low-income people, which he would not aggregate, but cannot unless some Government agency provides rent subsidies. No such money is currently available.
He estimates that it will cost $250 to $275 a month to cover the operating costs on each of his units. That is nearly $200 a month more than the average rent paid by tenants in Dallas public housing. "There is no way that I can fill 20 percent of the complex with very-low-income tenants," Mr. Gough said.
 
50 Tries, No Deals
 One agency that has had a particularly difficult time is the Volunteers of America, the nation's 22d-largest charity, founded nearly a century ago to provide housing to the poor. After two years of trying to buy some 50 trust corporation properties, it has been unable to close a single deal.
The organization says it has had financing problems and, in many cases when it finally learned what properties were available, the properties were no longer in the program for some reason -- or were not yet available for sale.
"We see this as a large opportunity to take care of housing for a large number of people," said Mr. Ervin, the Volunteers consultant. "But we've got limited resources."
Volunteers has tried to persuade the R.T.C. to help provide financing to buyers in the affordable-housing program by submitting a bid on some properties in the Texas package but with a second mortgage provided by the R.T.C.
The organization reasoned that the law required the trust corporation to provide financing to nonprofit buyers. But Resolution Trust turned down the bid.
"Affordable housing is the law," Mr. Ervin said. "It's a commitment from Congress and there should be an emphasis on making sure that what is the intention of the law occurs, and that's not happening. The R.T.C.'s job is to create affordable housing, not to find ways not to allow it."
 
Financing
Program Planned To Aid Agencies
 Resolution Trust says it is working with the Federal National Mortgage Association to develop a financing program that will help the nonprofit groups. Resolution Trust's Oversight Board has now adopted a policy allowing the agency to offer financing to nonprofit agencies with as little as a 5 percent down payment.
Still, although financing is important, the nonprofit groups said it could not alone solve all their problems with Resolution Trust.
Mr. Kurtz of the Travis County Mental Health Department has $2.5 million in foundation grants to buy apartment complexes for his clientele -- whose average income is about 17 percent of the area's median, or about $400 a month. The department has purchased 129 individual Austin apartments in eight locations on the open market.
But the Mental Health Department has also purchased one 20-unit apartment complex for $192,000 from Resolution Trust and has bid $320,000 for a 26-unit Austin complex. In the first case, Mr. Kurtz bid 85 percent of the agency's asking price, in the second one, 87 percent, hardly great discounts in his opinion.
Mr. Kurtz said he was not prepared for just how slow and confusing the process of buying would be. When he tried to submit a letter of intent to make a bid, the trust corporation asked him to get a resolution from his board authorizing him to look at the property.
Another resolution was needed to authorize him to bid. Another was needed to prove the agency was nonprofit. After Mr. Kurtz tried to submit the bid, he said he had to register with the trust corporation in order to do so. Then, after he thought he had a contract, the agency lost his down-payment check. A file clerk eventually found it.
To get information on other properties in the area, Mr. Kurtz said he had to know the name of the failed savings and loan that had owned the property.
Once his first bid was submitted, he said no one at the trust corporation could tell him whether it was accepted. And when he wanted to buy a second property, Mr. Kurtz could not resubmit some of the identical documents from the first time, but had to start all over again.
"It's driving me crazy," he said.
Nor, in Mr. Kurtz's opinion, did he get any break on price for his troubles. And, after bidding on the two properties, he saw an ad placed by Resolution Trust in The New York Times for a property next door to one he was buying that was better designed for his mentally ill tenants.
When he called the broker, he found that the property had already passed through the 90-day window during which properties are set aside exclusively for buyers agreeing to the affordable-housing restrictions and that some 10 investors had already put in bids.
Mr. Allen of Resolution Trust said things are getting better. "I don't think our procedure is bureaucratic or has a lot of red tape," he said, "and we are looking at ways the process can be improved."
But Mr. Kurtz remains skeptical. "I go to homeless conferences, and I see the faces of R.T.C. people there," Mr. Kurtz said, "But the R.T.C. is doing nothing to house the homeless."

HEADLINE: House Panel Approves Wider Bank Ownership

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 26

 BODY:
The House Banking Committee agreed today to permit industrial companies like retail chains and even automobile manufacturers to own banks.
This gave a tentative lift to the Bush Administration's plan to overhaul the nation's banking system. But the overall measure that would also let commercial banks operate across state lines, merge with investment banks and in some cases sell insurance, would have to clear many further hurdles before it could become law. 
 The committee plans to try to complete work on the measure tomorrow. It then must go to the Energy and Commerce Committee, where significant opposition has developed, before being taken up by the full House of Representatives.
In the Senate, the Banking Committee has not begun work on the measure officially. Senate committees often do not begin drafting controversial bills in public until all the important deals have been struck in private.
Still, the slow pace in the Senate makes it increasingly unlikely that broad legislation revamping the 60-year-old banking rules will be enacted this year.
 
A Need for Expansion
 Since the Depression, banks have been limited basically to taking deposits and making commercial loans. The Administration and its supporters maintain that in today's financial world, banks can attract sufficient capital to compete and prosper only if they are permitted to expand into other lines.
The legislation includes what its supporters say are thick "fire walls" that would separate banking from other businesses under the same ownership. For example, insured deposits could be used only in traditional banking activities, and banks could not lend money to their commercial affiliates.
Nonetheless, opponents contend that savvy bankers and their lawyers will find ways to breech the fire walls, and that taxpayers will be left paying for the banks' bad investments. "You're playing with fire," said Representative Jim Leach, Republican of Iowa.
The key vote today came on a proposal by Mr. Leach to continue to prohibit ownership of banks by commercial concerns. The proposal was rejected, 32 to 20.
There was no discernible pattern to how the lawmakers voted. Eleven Democrats and nine Republicans supported Mr. Leach; 20 Democrats and 12 Republicans opposed him.
Some liberal Democrats, like Henry B. Gonzalez of Texas, the committee chairman, and Joseph P. Kennedy 2d of Massachusetts, voted to prohibit industrial enterprises from buying banks. Others like Charles E. Schumer of Brooklyn and Barney Frank of Massachusetts supported the Bush Administration, voting to permit such purchases.
One proposal that was rejected tonight seems likely to provoke a partisan fight when the measure reaches the House floor.
This was Mr. Schumer's amendment that would have created two categories: core banks offering insured deposits paying only a limited rate of interest and that could lend no more than 3 or 4 percent of their equity to any one borrower; and other banks operating with uninsured deposits that could pay higher rates of interest and lend as much as they wanted to any depositor.
The proposal was rejected by a vote of 28 to 23, but Mr. Schumer vowed to offer it again to the full House.
The Bush Administration and most Republicans opposed the idea, mainly on the grounds that it might stifle competition or cause banks to lose deposits.
But many Democrats supported it as a way to guarantee that insured deposits were not used for risky activities like big loans to underdeveloped countries or for leveraged buyouts. That, the Democrats said, would lessen the likelihood of taxpayer bailouts.
No other issue this year has generated so much lobbying. The meeting room was jammed with representatives from dozens of interests, the hallway outside was clogged, and proceedings were piped into another room on the floor above so lobbyists who were too late to get into the Banking Committee's room could hear what was going on.
The ghost of the savings and loan disaster hovered over the debate today. Those who want to let banks get into other lines of business said that was the only way banks could survive and prevent another costly taxpayer bailout.

HEADLINE: Pickens Sells Japan Shares

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, June 26

 BODY:
T. Boone Pickens has formally ended his quixotic mission of opening corporate Japan to American corporate raiders by selling his shares in the Koito Manufacturing Company.
Mr. Pickens, the Texas oilman, acquired 26.4 percent of Koito, an automobile lighting manufacturer affiliated with the Toyota Motor Company, in 1989. He then waged a futile battle to gain several seats on the board. 
 Koito fought back with name-calling, unyielding resistance, open letters to the public seeking sympathy and, at the company's annual meeting last year, harassment during questioning.
In Dallas, Jay Rosser, a spokesman for the Boone Company, which Mr. Pickens heads, said today that Mr. Pickens had sold his Koito stake to Kitaro Watanabe, a Japanese stock speculator from whom he purchased the 42.2 million shares in 1989. He declined to disclose the price, but Koito's shares closed today at 2,390 yen, or about $17 at current exchange rates. Mr. Pickens is thought to have paid more than 3,300 yen a share.
In April, Mr. Pickens said he would give up his battle and sell the stock to Mr. Watanabe.
"There is both a tremendous sense of accomplishment and failure," Mr. Rosser said. "We have succeeded in putting the spotlight on Japan's closed economy and its anticompetitive bidding practices."

HEADLINE: First-Quarter G.N.P. Plunged by 2.8%

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 26

 BODY:
The economy contracted at a sharp 2.8 percent annual rate in the first three months of the year, while corporate profits posted their biggest decline since the spring of 1989, the Commerce Department said today.
The first-quarter decline in the gross national product followed a 1.6 percent drop in the fourth quarter of 1990, thus meeting the traditional definition of a recession as two consecutive quarters of declining G.N.P. 
 The decline in the gross national product for the first quarter represented a downward revision from an estimate last month that put the decline at 2.6 percent. The Government attributed the weaker G.N.P. showing to an even bigger drop in consumer spending than previously estimated and a larger rate of inventory liquidation by businesses.
 
Squeezed by the Recession
 The 6.3 percent decline in after-tax profits was the largest setback since the spring of 1989. It followed a 1 percent fall in the fourth quarter and emphasized that businesses were continuing to be squeezed by the recession, a situation that analysts said was likely to continue for some time.
In the first quarter, consumer spending fell at an annual rate of 1.5 percent. Business investment was down 16.5 percent and housing construction, the most depressed sector of the economy, fell 25.3 percent.
A crucial clue on the economy's second-quarter performance will come on Thursday when the Government releases its estimate of consumer spending for May. Based on a good retail sales report, analysts are looking for a sizable gain of around seven-tenths of 1 percent.
If they are right, it would provide a strong signal that a sector of the economy that accounts for two-thirds of total G.N.P. activity is rebounding.
The various changes left the gross national product in the first quarter at a level of $4.12 trillion, after adjusting for inflation.
Economists said the worse-than-expected figures, while surprising, did not shake their belief that the economy resumed growing in the current April-June quarter at a weak annual rate that many estimated at five-tenths of 1 percent.
The Bush Administration, meanwhile, indicated it was still concerned that the economy was being choked by a lack of available bank credit, and Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, said the Fed was devoting considerable time to wrestling with the credit crunch.
Mr. Greenspan, who appeared with Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp at a Congressional oversight hearing, said that so far he had seen little improvement in the slowdown in bank lending. He did not say whether the Fed was considering further moves to lower interest rates to combat the problem.
 
Weakest Recovery in History?
 Most economists are not looking for more interest rate cuts from the Fed in light of various statements by Fed officials expressing concerns about aggravating inflationary pressures at a time when the recession appears to be ending.
But many private economists are forecasting that the recovery will be the weakest in history, with G.N.P. growth in the July-December period averaging around 3 percent, less than half the normal rebound following a recession.
Other analysts said growth might not even reach that level, given the number of problems facing the economy, from failing banks to debt-burdened consumers. They said the rebound could falter after a quarter of growth and the recession could resume in full force in the second half of the year.
"With the ending of the negative shock from the Persian Gulf war, the economy did rebound in the spring," said Allen Sinai, the chief economist of the Boston Company. "But the question is whether that rebound can be sustained."
 
More Bankruptcies Seen
 The severity of the recession was also highlighted today when the American Bankruptcy Institute predicted that bankruptcy filings this year would exceed one million for the first time in history, representing a 30 percent increase over 1990.
From January through March, personal bankruptcies were up 26 percent and business bankruptcies were up 14 percent from a year earlier. Only farm bankruptcies showed any improvement, declining by 6 percent, the institute said.

HEADLINE: A Marked Change in Style For Nomura's Leadership

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, June 26

 BODY:
Hideo Sakamaki is scheduled to become the Nomura Securities Company's president and chief executive at the firm's annual meeting on Thursday. But this quiet man was in many ways the least likely choice to succeed Yoshihisa Tabuchi as head of the scandal-plagued brokerage, the world's largest securities house.
In a company full of men with quick, sharp tongues, the 56-year-old Mr. Sakamaki is thoughtful and soft spoken. 
 Traditionally, Nomura's leader has come from its core sales operations; Mr. Sakamaki has devoted himself to strategic planning.
And in a business where firms have prospered simply by doing what they have always done best, selling securities, Mr. Sakamaki has been prodding Nomura to expand abroad, learn new businesses and change its very culture.
For these reasons Mr. Sakamaki, perhaps more than anyone else, represents what Nomura and the rest of the Japanese securities industry have been struggling to become but -- as the current scandal indicates -- have not yet achieved.
Mr. Tabuchi was forced to resign in humiliation on Monday after the disclosure that Nomura practiced favoritism toward big investors, a practice that is considered endemic to Japan's domestic financial market, but which has been rejected in many foreign markets, including the United States.
Nomura admitted it had improperly compensated some big customers more than $120 million for stock market losses. The other three members of the Big Four securities houses -- Daiwa, Nikko and Yamaichi -- have made similar admissions.
What the scandal seems to have demonstrated is that, despite fresh oratory and a stated desire to expand overseas, Nomura remains a domestically oriented firm wedded to peculiarly Japanese practices.
"Could this kind of thing happen in another market?" asked one foreign securities executive here. "Yes," he said. "Could it have happened on that scale? No. It is hard to imagine anyone else earning enough from a customer to consider paying him back so much."
Another foreign executive characterized the disclosures as "a peek into the flow of the lifeblood of Japan Inc."
Mr. Sakamaki has important qualifications for the chief executive's job. For one, he was regarded as an indispensable lieutenant to Mr. Tabuchi, who was highly respected at Nomura. Mr. Sakamaki has also been the firm's key liaison with the powerful Finance Ministry bureaucrats who regulate the securities industry.
At the same time, his distance from the sales operation means Mr. Sakamaki has been personally untainted by the current scandal, which goes beyond the improper reimbursement of losses.
Nomura is regarded as the principal link between the billions of dollars churning around in the stock market here and those who are willing to pay for a chance to get some of that money. This includes not only individuals, politicians and big corporations but also, as the current scandal has shown, people with links to organized crime.
Nomura has confirmed that it provided more than $100 million in financing to one of Japan's best-known organized crime bosses and then helped him carry out what was apparently a stock-manipulation scheme.
Mr. Sakamaki has not been available for interviews this week, but in a long talk earlier this year he shared his views of where Nomura should head. And, in frank language, he admitted the firm's shortcomings.
He could not have foreseen the present firestorm, but his remarks captured the source of Nomura's current problems: the company's sense of itself as a sales machine of unparallelled power, doing whatever necessary to sell investment products and round up more clients.
Nomura does offer a full range of securities services, from underwriting and trading to merger advising, asset management and options and futures dealing. But the largest portion of its revenue by far comes from sales commissions.
"Nomura's strong suit is the marketing side," Mr. Sakamaki emphasized. "That is the heart of a good business, and it is what we have."
He added that in all the ventures he has helped Nomura form with American specialty firms -- with Wasserstein, Perella & Company in mergers, with Eastdil Realty in real estate and with Babcock & Brown in leasing -- he believed that Nomura's biggest contribution was its ability to sell products. What the venture partners could offer Nomura in return, he said, was an understanding of how to conduct new businesses and operate in different countries.
"I know we're not as creative as the United States, but that is something we hope we can learn," he said. "It's our attitude that needs some adjustment."
The unyielding nature of the Nomura culture, Mr. Sakamaki admitted, made learning new skills a difficult process -- one he compared to "running a hundred-meter hurdle race."
Mr. Sakamaki's desire to propel the culture forward is one reason he said he had put great emphasis on building up Nomura's broker training program. Last year he spun the training operations off as a separate business to give them autonomy and some identity, he said.
"We're still a few steps behind the U.S. in this area, but we're headed in the same direction," he said.
 
'Investors Have Lost Faith'
 "Japan has a very fair and open market," Mr. Sakamaki said, adding that it "has not been as well organized as the United States."
He noted that individual investors had been fleeing the market because of last year's stock market crash and a sense that the market was unfair to the smaller investor. "We know a lot of investors have lost faith because of what has happened," he said.
Mr. Sakamaki repeated that remark almost verbatim at a news conference on Monday, when his appointment as president of Nomura was announced.
"That has to be our job, to renew that faith," Mr. Sakamaki added. This time, though, he said nothing of Nomura's mission to build itself into a global firm.

HEADLINE: Washington at Work;
Jackson May Not Be Running But He's Still a Front-Runner

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 26

 BODY:
The Presidential campaign looms ever closer over the horizon. Racial politics are in the air. A dominant Democratic candidate has yet to emerge. All this leads to one thing: the Rev. Jesse Jackson is back.
Or at least he wants to be. 
 After two years of aimless wandering in a political Sinai, Mr. Jackson is moving to capitalize on recent events, sowing hope among his loyal followers and agita among some Democratic moderates.
The moderates had been hoping Mr. Jackson would continue on the arc of diminishing visibility that he has followed since declining to run for mayor of Washington, D.C., and settling for the obscurity of the make-work position of "shadow senator" for the District of Columbia. Instead, Mr. Jackson is raising the possibility of another run for the Democratic Presidential nomination, all the while declining to say that that is his plan.
"I have to look at all the political options for 1992 because I am the front-runner," he said.
In a few days of frenetic activity this month, Mr. Jackson put his political and personal strengths on display, as well as his weaknesses. He pointed out that the agency managing the savings and loan bailout was failing to award some contracts to black-owned businessess, as required by Federal regulations. He directed a disappointed bidder with internal documents detailing the practice to The New York Times in an effort to publicize what he considered an injustice. He criticized President Bush for his opposition to the civil rights bill, spelling out his differences with Republicans in ways few Democrats of weight have so far undertaken and with an oratorical passion few others can match.
"Race is a decoy that sets America against America," Mr. Jackson said in a recent speech castigating Republicans for what he said was using the quota issue for political gain. "It is a way for a politician to win, and the people to lose. It is morally wrong to polarize the country this way. Moreover, it is economically destructive. Race-baiting is a smokescreen that hides how vulnerable Americans really are."
At the same time, Mr. Jackson showed he is not above indulging his own ego and political jealousies. Sitting in his office, ticking off the bevy of Democratic heavy-hitters that would attend the five-day convention of the Rainbow Coalition, the political group he founded and heads, he sounded more like a youngster comparing his baseball card collection to that of his rival. In Mr. Jackson's case the rival is the Democratic Leadership Council, a moderate group that declined to invite Mr. Jackson to address its meeting last month.
"We've got Tsongas coming, Harkin coming, Gephardt coming, Simon coming, Gore coming, Graves coming, Rockefeller coming, Cardenas of Mexico coming," Mr. Jackson said. The references were to Senators Tom Harkin of Iowa, Paul Simon of Illinois, Al Gore of Tennessee and John D. Rockefeller 4th of West Virginia, all Democrats; former Senator Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts, a Democrat; Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House majority leader; Earl Graves, president of Black Enterprise Magazine, and Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, a former Mexican presidential candidate for the left-wing Democratic Revolutionary Party.
 
A Prominent Non-Invitation
 Mr. Jackson said that his conference, held this month, was "far more substantive, far more diverse," than the Democratic Leadership Council meeting. One possible Democratic candidate not invited was Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the chairman of the leadership council. "He is not a candidate," Mr. Jackson said when asked why Mr. Clinton was not asked to attend. "It's nothing personal. I have appreciation for his work."
Inquiries about Mr. Jackson's own plans for 1992 bring forth coy demurrals, but his actions speak louder than his demurrers. When newspapers fail to record Mr. Jackson's own view of himself as the front-runner, he is quick to provide polls showing that he is at or near the top of Democratic candidates in terms of name recognition and initial support.
For example, he has referred repeatedly recently to a nationwide poll of 355 Democrats, conducted in April for Time Magazine and Cable News Network, in which Jackson scored higher than any other Democrat mentioned as a potential Presidential nominee.
Whatever renewed attention Mr. Jackson may be getting must be enormously satisfying to a man who just a few months ago seemed dangerously close to what all politicians fear most: irrelevancy.
 
Wilder's Tribulations Help
 Not a few Democrats have been saying that Mr. Jackson's role as chief spokesman for blacks within the party was being eclipsed by Gov. L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia. Even the contract Mr. Jackson signed with Time Warner Inc. to host a syndicated television talk show was canceled.
Yet if the gods seemed to have been frowning on Mr. Jackson in the recent past, they have in recent days changed their expression. The recent tribulations of Mr. Wilder, who has been engaged in a nasty feud with Senator Charles S. Robb, a fellow Virginian, could eliminate him as a rival to Mr. Jackson for the position of most influential black politician in the Democratic Party.
Even the snubbing by the Democratic Leadership Council and the White House opposition to the civil rights bill may help catapault Mr. Jackson back into the news.
"There is clearly a leadership void in the progressive wing of the party," said David Axelrod of Chicago, a Democratic consultant. The party's only other marquee liberal, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York, is bogged down by his state's fiscal crisis, Mr. Axelrod noted.
Seated amid half-filled packing boxes at the Rainbow Coalition headquaters, on Vermont Avenue a few blocks from the White House, Mr. Jackson strenuously disputed the idea that he was losing stature or that he has been lying low. "We've been speaking out all along," he said, the back of his right hand tapping a visitor's knee for emphasis. "I speak to more people about the economic crisis in my country than any single leader in America today. Travel more and speak to more people."
Mr. Jackson is still dogged by the question of whether celebrity is viable substitute for experience. Despite his durability in the polls, Mr. Jackson enters this Presidential season with the same glaring shortcoming that dogged him in 1988: the lack of any administrative or legislative experience.
That shortcoming raises the question of whether Mr. Jackson made a watershed decision in his political career by failing to run for mayor of Washington, a post many believe he could have had for the asking.
 
Working Outside Spotlight
 Mr. Jackson would have none of such second-guessing about his political tactics, and the comparisons he reached for showed that he has come through the political wilderness with no self-doubt. He compared his political experience with that of people like Lech Walesa, the President of Poland, Vaclav Havel, President of Czechoslovakia and Nelson Mandela, deputy president of the African National Congress.
Mr. Jackson insists that outside the news media spotlight he has been forging links with union leaders and environmentalists, seeking to expand his base beyond blacks and white-collar suburban liberals who were his core support in 1988.
"I was here the other day working on this convention when a judge came down with a ruling that affects workers in a major way in the Northwest country -- owls and lumber workers there," he said, referring to a Federal court decision that limits the cutting of ancient forests. "I was the first person they called for help. They called here. The carpenters up in the Northwest."
If that sounds familiar, it is the 1992 version of the Rainbow Coalition rhetoric of 1988. It may not get Mr. Jackson to the finish line, but it almost certainly guarantees him a place at the starting line if he wants it. A former adviser to Mr. Jackson said, "He has no intention of going gently into anyone's good night."

HEADLINE: Renewed Trade Benefits for China Run Into a Roadblock in Congress

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 26

 BODY:
President Bush's push to renew trade privileges for China is in serious trouble in Congress, with approval almost certain to be tied to conditions China vehemently opposes.
The hostility in Congress leaves the Administration in a quandary, lawmakers and Administration officials said. The most likely course is for the President to veto the bill from Congress and make a series of concessions to key senators to insure that the veto is not overridden. Even supporters of the Administration acknowledge that if the concessions are made, a successful override of a Presidential veto would be very difficult. 
 Another choice would be for Mr. Bush to abandon his complete opposition to any conditions and accept a bill with as few conditions as possible.
The President's decision to renew most-favored-nation trade status again this year has stirred even broader resistance than last year, when lawmakers were responding to the military crackdown on the democracy movement in June 1989.
China has refused to release many political prisoners jailed after the crackdown, and has further antagonized members of Congress by refusing to impose greater controls on its arms exports, accumulating a $10.3 billion trade surplus with the United States last year and reportedly exporting products made with prison labor.
Mr. Bush told a group of senators today that he would prefer to deal with problems in United States-Chinese relations individually, instead of tackling many issues with the conditional renewal of China's most-favored-nation status.
The White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said today that the President was negotiating with Senator Max Baucus, a Montana Democrat. Mr. Baucus is leading a bipartisan group of 15 senators who would be willing to support the President on an unconditional renewal of lower tariffs for China in return for other trade and financial sanctions.
The senators favor Taiwan's application to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, a club of countries that commit themselves to obeying a long list of free-trade principles. They would also continue to bar China from receiving loans from international lending organizations like the World Bank.
The status of Taiwan is the subject of a bitter debate within the Administration because of the State Department's concern that its entry into GATT would infuriate China.
The intensity of Congressional distaste for the Chinese Government was apparent in today's debate and votes in the House Ways and Means Committee. Two leading opponents of unconditional renewal, who disagreed bitterly last year over how stringent conditions should be, reached a compromise before today's session, only to watch as the committee attached four more conditions.
The Senate Finance Committee is scheduled to vote on the issue Thursday morning, and the full House and Senate are expected to take it up after the Fourth of July recess.
 
'On a Veto Strategy'
 The Administration has mostly lobbied the Senate and paid less attention to the House, perceiving opposition to the President as stronger there. "We're still on a veto strategy," a senior official said. "I don't think we're looking at winning 50 percent, we're looking at winning 33 percent" in the Senate.
But a move on Tuesday by Senator George J. Mitchell, Democrat of Maine and the majority leader, to make his proposed conditions less stringent has prompted the Administration to begin reviewing its position, the official said. The question is whether the Senator's conditions are better from the Administration's point of view than the concessions demanded by Senator Baucus.
The Democrats, while more united than last year, face a quandary comparable to the President's. They must decide whether to approve a bill with conditions addressing each of their concerns or settle for a more limited bill that would be more likely to win enough support to override a veto.
Conditions of both bills include curbs on Chinese exports of nuclear technology and intermediate-range ballistic missiles and an end to exports to the United States of products that some lawmakers and rights groups say are made with prison labor.
The Senate bill also requires that China cut off aid to the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, while the House bill was amended today to require that China not permit forced abortions and involuntary sterilizations and that Taiwan be admitted to the GATT.

HEADLINE: California Nears Budget Deadline $14 Billion Short

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Calif., June 26

 BODY:
The nation's largest state is staggering toward the start of the new fiscal year Monday with an enormous budget shortage and growing signs that an elaborate compromise worked out by Gov. Pete Wilson may be starting to unravel.
An air of deepening crisis descended over the state capitol today as the Governor, a moderate Republican, closeted himself with leaders of the Democratic-controlled Senate and Assembly over the $14.3 billion shortage, which is by far the largest gap between spending and expected revenues ever faced by any state. The shortage is 30 percent of the state's general fund, which is the primary source for most essential services. 
 Last Thursday, the Assembly passed a $56 billion spending plan for the year beginning July 1, but lawmakers are now trying to reach accord on the taxes and cuts needed to balance the spending with the expected revenue. If that is not done by next Wednesday, the spending plan, by law, must die. At that point, the state would be plunged into a still deeper fiscal crisis that could threaten its bond ratings and cause layoffs of thousands of state workers.
The budget gap is nearly five times what California faced last year, a shortage that was made up by some taxes, along with bookkeeping devices to balance the budget, as the law requires. The huge shortage is the result of a combination of a recession-weakened economy, the effects of the voter-initiated referendum that limited the ability of local governments to raise taxes, Proposition 13, along with a huge population increase that placed big burdens on services for children, the elderly, AIDS patients and prisoners. The state now has a population of 30 million people, one in every nine Americans.
 
Wait Means Erosion of Plan
 As the talks dragged on today, elements of the Governor's plan that included a combination of taxes and spending cuts were eroding. Lobbyists were picking away at many of the new taxes the Governor had proposed, like broadening the sales tax to newspapers, magazines, candy and snacks, and imposing a 6 percent levy on telephone and cable television bills.
"The longer it goes on, the more deals start to fall apart," said one Assembly staff member.
The Governor and the four legislative leaders met until late this evening and left without disclosing whether they had made any progress.
 The messy climax to the California budget crisis has begun to dull Mr. Wilson's image as a pragmatic consensus-builder and problem-solver. He had been the subject of several upbeat reports by national news organizations touting him as a possible Presidential contender.
 
5% Tax Surcharge Proposed
 More people are suggesting that the solution to California's budget problems may be a "temporary" surcharge of 5 percent on the income tax owed the state. California's income tax is already among the highest in the country, with a top bracket of 9.3 percent.
The suggestions have come mainly from Republican Assembly members, who, despite their ideological aversion to higher taxes, find it preferable to other taxes. This puts the Republican Governor in a difficult position because he has vigorously opposed any general increase in personal or business income taxes.
Governor Wilson's efforts have also been snagged by the national political uproar he caused, perhaps unwittingly, when he proposed 10 days ago to take $1.6 billion from the $62.3 billion California Public Employees' Retirement System to help bridge the budget gap. He also proposed to revise the makeup of the system's board of directors to give himself control. The system is the largest pension fund in the world.
The Governor's proposal unleashed a fierce lobbying campaign by pension fund officials and state-employee unions that has threatened Mr. Wilson's entire budget package. Democratic leaders have balked at the Governor's proposals regarding the system, which was a main topic of today's meeting in the Governor's office
Governor Wilson's press secretary, William Livingstone, conceded that there would be modifications in the plan; it was widely expected that the Governor would be forced to drop his plan to take control of the pension system's board before any further progress could be made on the budget.
In addition to the $1.6 billion from the pension fund, Mr. Wilson had proposed to solve the budget shortage with $7.7 billion in higher taxes, the largest tax increase in state history, and nearly $5 billion in spending cuts, including a proposal to cut back welfare payments.
 
Assembly Members Balk
 The State Senate has accepted most of the package. But Governor Wilson has had trouble in the more fractious Assembly, both from the Republicans, most of whom refuse to vote for any new taxes without what they call "structural reforms" in government to cut spending permanently, and from liberal Democrats who are balking at cuts in welfare and other programs.
Uncertain about what to expect, state and local agencies have begun to make plans to lay off workers, shut hospitals and cut services. Supervisors in Alameda County, near San Francisco, voted Tuesday to lay off 200 county workers and close a mental health clinic and officials in Yolo County, near Sacramento, have decided to close Yolo General Hospital, which serves mainly the poor. Nearly all the campuses of the California State University plan to lay off faculty and staff members.
 
Governor Returns Two Cars
 Even the Governor has had to sacrifice. As he was asking the Legislature last week to cut welfare payments to women with young children, he received delivery of two $30,000 Lincoln town cars, official vehicles that his staff hastened to explain were ordered by his predecessor, George Deukmejian, a Republican who was a stern foe of government waste and spending.
Ultimately, the Ford Motor Company rescued Mr. Wilson from this embarrassment by taking the cars back, at the Governor's request, even though they had been specially modified to burn methanol fuel.
The plan for a 5 percent income-tax surcharge came from Assemblyman William P. Baker, a Republican from Alameda. It would raise more than $1 billion a year and would eliminate the need for the new telecommunications tax and some of the sales tax increases.
Governor Wilson has said he opposed such tax increases as damaging to a faltering economy. "There could be a push for higher income taxes, but it's hard to imagine it will work," said Mr. Livingstone, his spokesman.

HEADLINE: 2 Southern Banks Discuss Merger To Form the 2d Biggest in the U.S.

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES

 BODY:
The NCNB Corporation, a fast-growing banking powerhouse from the Southeast, is negotiating to acquire another large Southeastern banking company in what would be the largest merger in American banking history, setting the stage for a decade of consolidation in the troubled industry.
Directors of the C&S/Sovran Financial Corporation, which itself is the product of a merger last year, could decide as soon as today to accept NCNB's offer to combine and become the nation's second-largest banking organization. Its operations would stretch from the coastal cities of Baltimore and Miami to the oilfields of West Texas, and it would have assets of $116 billion.
 
Bigger Than BankAmerica
 It would surpass the BankAmerica Corporation, which had $111.9 billion in assets as of March 31. Only Citicorp, with assets of $216.9 billion, would be larger in the United States. 
 If NCNB can bring off the deal, it would open a new realm for super-regional banks, which began in the early 1980's as some states opened their borders to interstate acquisitions.
NCNB, which is based in Charlotte, N.C., has grown rapidly into Florida, and five other states including Texas -- where it wrangled billions of dollars in Federal assistance in 1988 to take over the failed First Republicbank, the state's largest.
In a decade, Hugh L. McColl Jr., NCNB's fiercely competitive chairman and chief executive, has taken his little-known bank with big ambitions and created a banking behemoth by acquiring a hodgepodge of community banks, failed banks and savings and loans as well as regional institutions.
NCNB has grown into one of the nation's 10 largest banking companies, has $66 billion in assets, from the North Carolina National Bank with $7.7 billion in assets in 1981.
In addition to NCNB, other strong regional banking companies include Banc One, of Columbus, Ohio; Fleet/ Norstar, of Providence, R.I.; NBD, of Detroit; Norwest, of Minneapolis and Suntrust, of Atlanta.
The prospect of an NCNB-C&S/Sovran merger "is potentially a catalytic event for the banking industry," said James J. McDermott, Jr., president of Keefe, Bruyette, Woods Inc., a bank research firm in New York.
William M. Isaac, the former head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, said, "It is enlarging and redefining the emerging super-regional banks." He added that the strong earnings power of regional banking organizations like NCNB allows them to make acquisitions of weaker institutions.
Many industry experts believe 10 to 15 super-regional banking organizations will emerge before the decade is out, ranging from $100 billion to $200 billion in assets. "We are going to see the banking industry continue to consolidate," Mr. Isaac predicted.
Banking experts have long anticipated that some hard-charging regional banks would come to rival some of the nation's biggest banks in money centers like New York, Chicago and San Francisco. Word of a possible merger moved C&S/Sovran's stock on the New York Stock Exchange to close as $22.75, up $3.375. NCNB's shares on the Big Board closed at $38.25, up 12.5 cents.
A person close to NCNB said the deal would be worth almost $4 billion in stock for shareholders of C&S/Sovran.
A spokesman for C&S/Sovran, which has headquarters in Atlanta and Norfolk, Va., Scott Scredon, said yesterday that the company's chairman and chief executive, Bennett A. Brown, had been authorized to meet with NCNB's Mr. McColl, "to discuss the North Carolina bank's proposal to merge." It said that Mr. Brown would discuss NCNB's offer with the C&S/ Sovran board today.
In a statement, NCNB confirmed "preliminary and exploratory" discussions between the companies and added it looked forward to continuing the talks.
Mr. McDermott, the banking analyst, said investors were unconvinced by Wednesday's announcements that NCNB would eventually succeed in adding C&S/Sovran to its growing network. "We are in the early stages," he cautioned. In the past, big bank mergers have hit snags and Mr. McColl's blunt, outspoken style has a reputation for rubbing some people the wrong way.
 
Earlier Takeover Proposal
 C&S/Sovran was forged last year from two regional companies, the Citizens & Southern Corporation, based in Atlanta, and the Sovran Financial Corporation, of Norfolk, Va., after Mr. Brown of Citizens & Southern rejected a hostile takeover offer from NCNB in 1989.
For NCNB, C&S with or without Sovran had some attractive strategic advantages. Since, 1985, when NCNB bitterly lost out in a bid to acquire a big Atlanta bank, Mr. McColl has been minor player in Georgia and Atlanta where C&S dominates the market and the economy grew robustly in the mid-1980's.
Now with Sovran, NCNB would get a large franchise in the suburban Washington market. That area is mired in a real estate recession, but Mr. McColl has perceived the region as a lucrative consumer banking market with long-term growth potential.
Besides Georgia and Washington's suburbs in Maryland and Virginia, a C&S/Sovran deal would include banks in the deal Tennessee, South Carolina, Kentucky, Maryland and Florida.
 
Problems From Earlier Merger
 For C&S/Sovran, a combination with NCNB may be the best solution for a merger that had its problems. Many C&S/Sovran shareholders have been disappointed with the results. Wall Street analysts faulted company executives earlier this year for moving too slowly to trim payrolls and exploit other cost-cutting opportunities that usually provide the economic appeal for regional banking mergers.
The company reported a 72 percent drop in earnings in the first quarter along with a jump in nonperforming assets to $1.1 billion, or more than 3 percent of loans outstanding -- an unhealthy level. The recession was a factor, but the main problems included bad loans on several commercial real estate projects in the Washington area.
The company continues to pay a dividend and has adequate capital, but its stock value has plunged. Mr. Brown, who is 62 years old, postponed his retirement planned for the end of this year and agreed to stay for at least another year.
 
Change of Attitude Possible
 But some individuals believe that Mr. Brown, who refused in 1989 to meet with NCNB's Mr. McColl, to discuss the earlier takeover offer, is more willing to bargain now because a takeover by NCNB would bring a more rapid payoff for C&S/Sovran shareholders than would be required if the company remained independent.
John S. Poelker, a financial consultant in Atlanta who worked with Mr. Brown for eight years as president of Citizens & Southern between 1978 and 1986, said the big question facing directors on Thursday will be how fast the company's earnings and stock value can rebound on their own compared with the bid NCNB puts on the table.
"Clearly, the combination of C&S/ Sovran with NCNB creates a very powerful entity with a lot of resources," Mr. Poelker said. He said C&S/Sovran would require as many as three years before the stock could recover from the recent setbacks.
A person close to NCNB said Mr. McColl's offer was to exchange each common share of C&S/Sovran for three-quarter share of NCNB stock. C&S/Sovran has 133.4 million common shares outstanding.
Figured at the closing price Wednesday for NCNB's shares, at $38.25, the deal would be worth $28.69 a share for C&S/Sovran shareholders, a 26 percent premium over C&S/Sovran's closing stock price of $22.75 yesterday on the Big Board.
In a separate announcement, NCNB said its earnings for the second quarter would fall slightly, to $1.20 to $1.25 a share, compared with $1.26 a share in the corresponding period last year. Profits will be flat or slightly higher than the $1.20 a share earned in the first quarter this year, the company said, with nonperforming loans rising $20 million to $50 million.

HEADLINE: ALBANY OFFICIALS WEIGH BORROWING FOR NEW YORK CITY

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
As New York City's budget stalemate worsened yesterday, state officials weighed with renewed urgency proposals for long-term recovery that could avert some of the pain and spread the rest over several years.
The goal would be to let the city borrow to cover deficits -- which is strictly forbidden now -- without the stigma of invoking the authority of the State Financial Control Board, whose binding powers over the city's budget largely lapsed after the city recovered from its fiscal crisis of the mid-1970's. 
 Another goal would be to enlist the support of Mayor David N. Dinkins, who earlier this year briefly mulled the notion of borrowing to cover recurring deficits but has fiercely opposed the challenge to his prerogatives by a reinvigorated control board, which deficit financing would trigger.
 
Union Concessions Needed
 Any successful long-term strategy would be contingent on concessions from municipal unions so that the borrowing would not merely substitute for proposed layoffs and increased productivity. Moreover, the strategy would have to pass muster with the municipal bond market, which last month signaled its opposition to one version of borrowing proposed by Felix G. Rohatyn, chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation.
The Mayor's chief spokesman, Leland T. Jones, responded cautiously to the latest proposals. He said yesterday that the city could balance its next budget with the cooperation of the State Legislature and the City Council but warned that any suggestion of deficit financing would make the bond markets "wacky."
That apprehension was shared in Albany. At stake in the delicate maneuvering are not only the city's precarious finances but also the political reputations of Mr. Dinkins and of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, who is reluctant to be perceived as usurping the city's first black mayor.
 
Start of New Fiscal Year
 As state officials, including members of Mr. Cuomo's administration, and economic advisers searched for a long-term solution, the city's effort to balance its budget by Monday, the beginning of its new fiscal year, was complicated on two fronts yesterday.
Adamant City Council leaders announced last evening that they would draft their own alternative to the Mayor's $29 billion budget by today without the $476 million more in property taxes, proposed by Mr. Dinkins, than the Council has been willing to endorse. [Page B4.]
In Albany, the State Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino, a Nassau County Republican, and the six Republican senators from New York City in effect allied themselves with the Council by declaring that they would reject the city's request to raise income tax rates unless other proposed tax increases were rescinded.
Those developments contributed to concern at City Hall that any budget adopted by next week would include most of the severe cuts that Mr. Dinkins and other politicians had hoped to avoid. Yesterday, the Governor convened a meeting of the Financial Control Board for Tuesday to review the city's progress on its budget.
"I have only one desire: cooperation, not control," Mr. Cuomo said yesterday.
But with the budget talks deadlocked, several state officials and city and state economic advisers have been discussing the need for a broader recovery plan to get the city past its latest fiscal crisis -- presumably by assembling a bailout that would, among other things, allow the city to rescind some cuts that are to go into effect next week.
 
Lukewarm Reception
 Similar plans received a lukewarm reception from the Governor earlier this year after they were viewed, particularly among some black political figures, as a challenge to Mayor Dinkins's control over city finances.
One official familiar with the latest effort said it could only succeed with the Mayor's full support. It would seek to somehow avoid another period of control by the state board -- at least to the extent that it was exercised when the board was first created -- to spare Mr. Dinkins the seeming loss of political face and to spare the city the stigma associated with deficit financing.
It was unclear whether the borrowing would be by the Municipal Assistance Corporation, created in the mid-1970's to issue bonds on the city's behalf, or some other mechanism.
Edward V. Regan, the State Comptroller, agreed yesterday with proposals for a multiyear plan to address structural problems in the budget but cautioned that some oversight authority would be necessary.
 
A Long-Term Plan
 By imposing a long-term recovery plan, the city could avoid further savaging services because it would have more time to bridge recurring deficits. The plan would also require the cooperation of municipal unions in shrinking the city's work force and making it more efficient.
Existing inefficiences were raised in Albany yesterday as one reason for the Senate's reluctance to pass a tax package that Republicans denounced as excessive.
"In a city that has been criticized for putting only one out of three of its education dollars in the classroom and finds money to have supervisors supervising the supervisors who supervise the actual workers," Mr. Marino, the Senate majority leader, said, "it is clear that Albany must not hand the Mayor a blank check on taxes."
While they disagree over the city's tax package, Mr. Marino and the Assembly Speaker, Mel Miller, a Brooklyn Democrat, concurred yesterday in their opposition to the Governor's veto earlier this month of $900 million worth of expenditures in the budget belatedly approved by the Legislature.
The legislative leaders indicated that they would pass new bills next week to spend the $800 million surplus that they maintained the vetoes had created. Mr. Cuomo, who has threatened to veto any bills that he does not believe are backed by sufficient revenues, said yesterday, "If the statements by the legislative leaders today are meant to warn us that they are seriously considering spending money they don't have, then, regrettably, they have placed us on the road to fiscal chaos."
Representatives of the Mayor and the Council traded recriminations and agreed on only one thing yesterday: not to bother returning to Albany today to lobby for a $335 million city income tax increase. They still lacked the two assurances that the State Senate was demanding before it considered the increase -- an agreement between them on how much property taxes would be raised and an agreement with municipal unions on "givebacks."

HEADLINE: Hilton Cleared to Operate A Casino in Atlantic City

BYLINE: By WAYNE KING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ATLANTIC CITY, June 26

 BODY:
The hotelier Barron Hilton, denied a license to operate a casino in Atlantic City in 1985 because of connections to a reputed organized-crime figure, received a green light from casino regulators today to return to the city.
The decision prompted speculation that Mr. Hilton would try to win back the financially tottering Castle Casino, which he lost to Donald J. Trump six years ago. 
 "We could have a new baron in the Castle," quipped a Casino Control Commission staff member just before the commission voted.
The five-member commission certified unanimously that Mr. Hilton and the worldwide hotel chain that he heads now had the financial backing and the unblemished integrity required to operate a casino here.
 
A Setback in 1985
 That was not the case in 1985 when Mr. Hilton, chairman of the Hilton Hotels Corporation, applied for a casino license to operate a casino hotel that the chain had built in the Marina section of Atlantic City.
The commission decided then that neither Mr. Hilton nor the corporation could be licensed because they did business with a California lawyer, Sidney Korshak, who was described by the commission as someone "reputed to be a 'fixer' for organized crime." The commission also said that some Hilton hotels had been involved in kickback schemes and other improprieties.
But today, in granting Mr. Hilton and Hilton Hotels permission to run a casino here, the commission found that both had purged themselves of any questionable associations. Both severed their relationships with Mr. Korshak in 1984, the commission said, and now display "good character, honesty and integrity."
The commission said a license would be granted when Hilton acquired a casino property in Atlantic City, a step that Mr. Hilton said he planned to take.
 
A Switch in Casino Names?
 In 1985, when the Hilton chain found itself unable to open the casino hotel it had already completed in Atlantic City, there were quick negotiations with Mr. Trump. These resulted in sale of the property for $320 million, which was about what Hilton had invested, and Mr. Trump took down the Hilton logo on the front of the casino and put up his own: Trump's Castle.
Mr. Trump's subsequent financial tumble fueled speculation today that Mr. Hilton might be planning to put his name back up there again.
Mr. Trump, who sharply increased the casino's debt with a 100-room, $100 million expansion in the late 80's, has missed recent bond payments of more than $40 million on the Castle, one of three casinos he owns in Atlantic City.
Last week the commission ruled that Mr. Trump had enough financial stablity to retain his licenses at his two other casinos, the Taj Mahal and the Plaza, but deferred action on the Castle.
The commission laid down a series of deadlines today that Mr. Trump must meet to complete the financial restructuring he has pledged will save the Castle from financial collapse. If he does not meet them, he will lose his license to operate the casino.
Gregory R. Dillon, vice chairman of the Hilton Hotels Corporatin, based in Beverly Hills, Calif., said today that there have been no negotiations with Mr. Trump or anyone else. He said, however, "It would be much easier to go down the street and buy a hotel rather than build one."
One dissident holder of bonds on the Castle, who has refused Mr. Trump's current offering of a restructuring, said he would be delighted if Mr. Hilton took over. The bondholder, Mort Cohen of Margate, N.J., said: "I can't tell you how thrilled I would be with the Hilton corporation."
In another action today that underscored the difficulties afflicting the gambling and tourist industries in a time of economic downturn, the commission agreed to a debt restructuring proposal involving the Bally's Park Place and Bally's Grand casinos in Atlantic City. The parent company, Bally's Manufacturing, is having financial difficulty in its Las Vegas gaming operation and must reduce its involvement in Atlantic City as a result.

HEADLINE: Roland Van Zandt, 72, Writer And Historian of the Catskills

BYLINE: By ELEANOR BLAU

 BODY:
Roland Van Zandt, an author and historian who was concerned with the preservation of the Catskills, died on Monday at the Benedictine Hospital in Kingston, N.Y. He was 72 years old and lived in Shandaken, N.Y.
He died of cancer, said Deborah Allen, co-publisher of the Black Dome Press. 
 The Black Dome Press recently issued a special edition of Mr. Van Zandt's first book, "The Catskill Mountain House," on the 25th anniversary of its publication by Rutgers University Press.
The book is about a famous Greek revival hotel and the early development of the area. Reviewing it in The New York Times in 1967, Henry Christman said the author had "re-created the fascinating history of the upper Catskills to give a large and illuminating view of America's 19th-century cultural, social and economic growth."
Mr. Van Zandt wrote two other books, "The Metaphysical Foundations of American History" and "Chronicles of the Hudson." He also wrote a play, "Wilson in the Promise Land," which ran briefly on Broadway in 1970, as well as articles and reviews.
He was the director and then an adviser of the Catskill Center for Conservation and Development.
A graduate of Rutgers University, he received a master's degree from Harvard University and a Ph.D. in American studies from the University of Minnesota.
Surviving are his wife, the former Leona Thompson; two daughters, Caroline and Carla, both of New York City; a son, Carter R., of Shandaken, and four brothers, Henry, of Madison, Conn., Harvey, of Morristown, N.J., Richard, of Laguna Beach, Calif., and Harry, of Clifton Knolls, N.Y.

HEADLINE: Making Child Care America's Business

BYLINE: By CAROL LAWSON

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass.

 BODY:
WHEN the good times rolled in the 1980's, business school graduates could not get to Wall Street fast enough. Just about the last venture on graduates' minds was the child-care industry, a business that operates, at best, with fragile profit margins.
But Linda A. Mason and Roger H. Brown, who hold degrees from the Yale School of Organization and Management, are not typical business school graduates. This husband-and-wife team had worked with children as managers of large-scale relief programs for Cambodian refugees in Thailand and famine victims in the Sudan. To them, the child-care business made perfect sense. 
 "We wanted to combine our business backgrounds with our interest in social services," Ms. Mason said last week in her small office here, decorated with photographs of her two young children. "I know this sounds hokey, but we wanted to do something idealistic."
In 1987, they started Bright Horizons Children's Centers , which designs and operates work-site child-care centers for corporations, hospitals and real-estate developers in several states, primarily in the Northeast. Bright Horizons runs 39 centers with a total enrollment of about 2,500 children and a staff of 500 employees.
Its clients include the Prudential Insurance Company of America, Dun & Bradstreet, Phoenix Mutual Life Insurance Company, the Army Corps of Engineers, International Business Machines and several hospitals in New England, including Beth Israel in Boston, where the newest center opened in April.
Beth Israel spent $2.4 million to build its 9,700-square-foot center, an addition to a hospital building, plus an outdoor playground of 8,000 square feet. The center, which is carpeted throughout, is spacious, clean and cheerful. It has a series of rooms and play spaces to meet the needs of children of different ages. The staff of 35 can care for as many as 114 children, from 6 weeks to 5 years old. There are 103 children enrolled, but there is a waiting list for Bunny Bungalow, the infants' area.
"We have had a lot of positive feedback from parents," said Lisa Fiering, a benefits specialist in the hospital's human resources department. "They are able to visit their children during the day. Some come down for lunch or to nurse their babies."
Ms. Mason, 36, and Mr. Brown, 34, began with the goal of operating on-site centers to suit the needs of individual corporations. They wanted to defy the conventional wisdom that a child-care company that operates multiple centers cannot maintain quality. Child-care experts say they have succeeded.
"They have an excellent reputation for running very fine centers," said Dr. Susan Ginsberg, an associate dean at Bank Street College in Manhattan who directs the college's Work and Family Life seminars for corporations. "They have high standards and a staff of very good people."
Dr. Edward F. Zigler, a Yale psychologist and an author of "Child Care Choices" (The Free Press, 1991), said he was so impressed by Bright Horizons that he accepted a nonpaying position on its advisory board. "They pay a decent salary and make sure the staff is trained and qualified to care for children," Dr. Zigler said.
Maintaining quality is difficult because of competing economic pressures. "You have to charge fees that parents can afford, yet you must pay wages that teachers find attractive," Mr. Brown said.
The child-care industry is known for low wages and high turnover of employees. In 1988, the National Child Care Staffing Study found, the average hourly wage for chains was $4.10 an hour and the average annual turnover of staff was 74 percent.
Ms. Mason said the annual turnover at Bright Horizons is between 20 and 30 percent. She refused to disclose hourly wages "because it upsets teachers who make less," but she said Bright Horizons pays "significantly above the national average."
Ms. Mason and Mr. Brown decided at the outset that they would require corporate subsidies in the form of free or low-cost real estate. By saving money on rent, they reasoned, they would be able to spend more on salaries. The companies for which they operate centers provide space rent-free, although in some cases Bright Horizons pays for utilities, taxes and maintenance.
It offers its directors and teachers a variety of benefits not commonly found in the child-care industry, including medical and dental insurance, stock options, life insurance and partial tuition reimbursement. And it continues to train staff members after hiring and has experts to monitor and development curriculums.
The fees at Bright Horizons centers typically range from $90 to $225 a child a week. Fees are highest in urban areas.
At six of the 39 Bright Horizons centers, employers subsidize the fees for low-income families. At Beth Israel Hospital, for example, employees who earn less than $20,000 a year pay $33 a week. The hospital pays the rest of the tuition, which is $140 a week for pre-school children and $225 a week for infants.
But even with subsidies, child care is a tough business. "There is little room for error," said Ms. Mason, who is on maternity leave after the birth of her son two months ago. Her other child, a 2-year-old daughter, is enrolled in a Bright Horizons center in her office building.
Bright Horizons was begun with $2 million that Ms. Mason and Mr. Brown raised from family members, private investors and Mr. Brown's former employer, Bain & Company, a management consulting firm in Boston. They were joined by Anne Whitman and Jack Reynolds, a Cambridge couple who could not find decent child care for their infant daughter, and Lois Baker, who had been a teacher and child-care center director. Mr. Reynolds remains on the board, but Ms. Whitman and Ms. Baker are no longer with the company.
Before the first center opened in 1987 in the Prudential Building in Boston, Ms. Mason said, there was "a harrowing year" of searching for business. "The on-site, corporate-sponsored center was a very new concept, and a lot of corporations saw no benefit in it," she said. "They did not understand that a child-care center would cut down absenteeism and help to retain employees."
Ms. Mason said that at the urging of the pediatrician Dr. T. Berry Brazelton, who is also an unpaid adviser, Bright Horizons has made a point of involving parents. "Every day, parents of infants and toddlers get a written note from the teacher, telling them what the child did," she said. "Twice a year, there are formal parent-teacher conferences, to go over the child's development."
Mr. Brown said the idealism that he and his wife share stems from their small-town backgrounds. He grew up in Gainesville, Ga., which calls itself, he said, "the chicken capital of the world." Ms. Mason comes from the upstate New York town of Homer, which, he noted, "has more cows than people."
"It's easier to be idealistic in a small town because you feel you can do something about a problem, that you can make a difference," Mr. Brown said.
Ms. Mason said that recently she returned to Yale for a reunion and found "all my friends making huge salaries." She did not have second thoughts.
"I love running my own company, and I love having my family be part of it," she said. "I can't imagine leaving for a more secure position on Wall Street."
"Secure?" Mr. Brown retorted in his Georgia drawl. "All my friends on Wall Street are watching their backs."

HEADLINE: A Family Affair: Paying for the Wedding

 BODY:
GONE are the days when only the father of the bride picked up the wedding tab. In these tight economic times, splitting the wedding bill is very much a family affair.
"It's no longer shameful to say you're having financial difficulties, and very often the parents of the bride will let that be known," said Marcy Blum, a wedding consultant in New York. 
 Although they lack hard numbers, wedding planners say the recession has led to an increase in the number of "pooled weddings," which are paid for by a number of people, including friends who chip in for parties and even the honeymoon.
For many families, however, a pooled wedding often leads to strained relations or even disputes during what is supposed to be a sweet season of celebration. Nearly everyone who pays a share of a wedding wants a say in what goes on.
"Asking both sides of your families to contribute to your wedding is a very touchy issue," said Barbara E. Kirby, 37 years old, who is getting married this weekend in Hyannis port, Mass.
Ms. Kirby, an interior designer, and her fiance, Ford V. Swick, 35, a real-estate developer, are unemployed.
"In the beginning, lots of family members were willing to help, but the reality is that no one hands you a blank check," said Ms. Kirby, who plans to dip into her dwindling savings to pay for a third of the wedding costs. Her father and her fiance's family plan to contribute an equal amount.
"The whole thing was such a strain, with both of us unemployed, that we almost called the wedding off; our family convinced us not to cancel," said Ms. Kirby, who will have 150 guests, six bridesmaids and a buffet dinner at her wedding. "We started planning at a time when we assumed we'd get jobs."
Lavish weddings remain popular, said Cele Lalli, editor of Modern Bride magazine, and for couples who want them, trimming costs or getting financial help from family members or friends is often a necessity.
Earlier this year, 20 friends of a Manhattan couple paid for their honeymoon, a night in a suite at the Royalton Hotel on West 44th Street.
Regan M. Botts, a wedding consultant in Washington, said 75 percent of the couples she works with finance their own weddings because of shifting family relationships and finances. Many parents have divorced and remarried, and many fathers of the bride, now with new families, cannot afford a large wedding.
Since engaged couples today tend to be older, with established careers, Ms. Botts said, "it doesn't make sense to ask Dad to dole out all the money." The median age of first-time brides and grooms has risen from 20 and 22 years old, respectively, in 1965, to 24 and 26 years old last year. More working couples have been paying for all or part of their weddings in recent years, but their ranks have been low until now, wedding planners said.
"There is a definite trend in which couples are financing some portion of the wedding," Ms. Lalli said. "Times are tough; it's the reality."
Ms. Blum said that about 65 percent of the couples she sees share the wedding expenses.
"It's no longer the bride sitting in my office, pouting and saying, 'But Daddy, I wanted the silver Rolls Royce,' " she said.
According to Modern Bride, the average wedding and reception cost about $16,000. In its next market survey, the magazine will ask how couples split the bill, Ms. Lalli said.
Where traditional etiquette reigns, the groom's family pays for the rehearsal dinner, flowers at the ceremony, clothes for the groom's attendants and sometimes for the alcohol at the reception. But for many couples and their families, that tradition is far from practical.
Sheryl Nance, 30, a reporter for The New York Law Journal, was torn between a quick jaunt to City Hall and a large wedding in her hometown of Oakland, Calif.
"Our major consideration was price," said Ms. Nance, who opted for a small ceremony at a chapel in Brooklyn. "My original budget was completely unrealistic: $3,500. We came in at about $6,000, which is cheap!"
Ms. Nance and her husband, Collin Nash, 46, a newspaper reporter, who had a combined income of about $50,000 when they started planning the wedding, had to limit their guest list to 75 for the wedding and a reception at a friend's house. Two friends gave them a $500 cocktail party as a wedding gift.
"So many of their friends couldn't come to the wedding that we thought a party would replace the reception," said Kris Oser, a friend of the couple.
Gale Lance, 26, a marketing assistant in Redondo Beach, Calif., is very organized. One week after Jeff H. Gould, 26, a marine superintendent for a shipping company in San Pedro, Calif., proposed to her, she opened a separate bank account and had $250 deducted from her paycheck each week and placed in the account.
"We didn't want to go into debt, especially during a recession," said Ms. Lance, who cut costs by planning a wedding brunch instead of a large reception. "There's no way I could expect my parents to come up with the money, and we didn't want to go to his parents for all of it, so everyone is giving a little bit."
Ms. Lance's father paid for the invitations, her mother bought the wedding dress and her future in-laws are paying for the liquor and the disk jockey at the reception.
"Both families will be paying the same amount, so no one's nose will get out of joint," said Ms. Lance, who acted like the captain of a baseball team, arranging for each player in her family to pay for something.
"We're picking up the rest of the tab," said Ms. Lance, who is also defying convention by having her mother accompany her down the aisle.
Who pays for what is not the only thing that's changing about weddings. For example, many couples want top billing on their invitations, a spot traditionally reserved for their parents.
"The whole gestalt has changed," Ms. Blum said.

Trim Fat at the Top

BYLINE: By ANNA QUINDLEN

 BODY:
There is a management style you might call bottom up. It suggests that when a company wants to build a better mousetrap, the first place to look for proposals is not in the office of the vice president for strategic planning. It is on the factory floor, where the men and women who build mousetraps can testify to what works, where a 25-year veteran can say, "We always thought that if you wound the little metal thing around just one more time, you'd have the sucker perfected."
There's very little evidence that the City of New York ever used the bottom-up technique when it was planning its latest budget, a budget that promises to leave thousands of people without jobs and hundreds of thousands without services. 
 There is little evidence that department heads went to the factory floors, to hear from the nurses' aides, the teachers, the sanitation workers and the secretaries about where the fat could be trimmed. Perhaps they knew what one answer would be. At most corporations, I would wager the $21,000-a-year workers would tell you there's room at the top for economy.
In city government they would certainly be right.
The city Personnel Department reports that there are 150,000 employees in agencies directly under the mayor's jurisdiction, almost 4,000 of those management. The Personnel Department says 8,000 workers would be laid off under the Mayor's budget plan.
Only 49 of the management types would lose their jobs.
Libraries, preschools, drug rehabilitation programs and playgrounds will close because of this budget. Streetlights will dim; potholes will deepen. Health care will deteriorate. One sanitation worker got his pink slip and jumped from the roof of the housing project where he lived with his wife and two young sons.
But most management jobs will be protected.
Harsh measures are required to close this deficit now. But like the people on the factory floor who listen to the boss poormouth and then become angry when they discover he's negotiated a golden parachute the size of the Hoosier Dome, the line workers in city government deserve to know that harsh measures are egalitarian.
The use of cars and drivers, what we now call Sununus, should be cut to the bone, because of expense and because the subway would help commissioners and elected officials keep in touch with the city. The boondoggle of extra pay for Council committee chairmanships must end. Someone might argue that this would lower the caliber of people in the Council; it is important that someone make that argument because in bad times we all need a good laugh.
The president of the battered borough of the Bronx has a staff of 140 people, 41 more than the Manhattan borough president and probably twice as many as he should have.
And the City Council president, with staff, costs almost $4 million a year. The job is not unlike that of the Vice President of the United States; it provides an attractive suite of rooms for someone looking to run for higher office. (The Council president has also been designated city ombudsman. The borough presidents can ombuds, with their 100-plus staffs.) The city can no longer afford a luxury like the Council president when it is losing homeless shelters, summer job programs and meals for senior citizens.
There should be significant cuts in management positions in every agency, for three obvious reasons: because the managers will have fewer people to manage, because any exhortation to do more with less must be fulfilled first at the highest levels, and because it serves the taxpayers to have more people on the street and fewer behind desks.
 Next year, the fiscal wizards might start by asking the workers where the fat can be found. (The workers, not the union leadership. That's just more fat management, guys who haven't made a mousetrap in a decade and who sit in air-conditioned offices and wax poetic about the lot of the mousetrap worker.) One school nurse's aide suggested the other day that any city employee making over $100,000 should return 10 percent to the till, a gesture of good faith that would be a kind of tithing to the municipal gods. Praise the Lord and pass up the perks.

HEADLINE: How to Read the Black Migration to the North

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I think it's significant that Mitchell Duneier's "Black Migrants Have Done Better" (Op-Ed, June 11), criticizing my book "The Promised Land," never actually quotes from the book. That's because Mr. Duneier's real objection is to an article I wrote five years ago, and his search for offending material in the book leads him into the shadowy realm of impressions and implications. 
 I am well aware that studies comparing black migrants from South to North with blacks born in the North show that migrants' incomes are higher. I mention several of these studies in the book and in the footnotes, as Mr. Duneier acknowledges. He triumphantly announces that there is a study I didn't cite -- but there are dozens of studies I didn't cite that make the same basic point as the ones I did cite. I'm also well aware of William Julius Wilson's objections to my 1986 articles. I had them in mind as I researched and wrote, and I asked Dr. Wilson to read the book in manuscript (which he generously did, raising no objections to what I say about migration).
"The Promised Land" argues that the great black migration was an enormously important shaping event in American society. I made a point of including in it the stories of middle-class migrants and of discussing at length the growth of the black middle class; I didn't want to leave the impression that the migration was made up only of the rural poor or that most of the migrants didn't succeed in the North.
Still, I chose to make Ruby Haynes, a former Mississippi sharecropper who lived in Chicago for three decades, the book's main character. She was born to a teen-age mother in 1915, didn't meet her father until she was grown up, had children out of wedlock herself and had a poor education. In all this, she was typical of the sharecropper society she grew up in, as a wealth of firsthand scholarly material on that society will attest.
In telling the story of her life in a high-rise, low-income housing project in Chicago, I spent many pages describing how the city's politics, the economy, Federal social policies and urban demography affected her. I never said or suggested that her background was the sole determinant of her fate -- quite the contrary.
I know that impulses exist to dismiss the black migration as a failure, to impute all the problems of the ghettos to migrants and to be blind to the black middle class. But none of those impulses animated my book. Since the book was published, Mrs. Haynes has been treated as a heroine in her hometown of Clarksdale, Miss.
I was trying to break stereotypes with my writing, not reinforce them. Published response to the book contains none of the negative or hostile reaction to the African-American experience Mr. Duneier worried it might set off.

HEADLINE: How to Read the Black Migration to the North;
Evidence From the 30's

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Mitchell Duneier raises some very important questions as a sociologist in "Black Migrants Have Done Better" (Op-Ed, June 11), questions that have interested, troubled and fascinated not only sociologists, but also the public and the press for more than 60 years. 
 Mr. Duneier criticizes Nicholas Lemann's book "The Promised Land: the Great Black Migration and How It Changed America" for neglecting the beneficial effect of a Northern environment on Southern blacks who migrated North, particularly on economic success.
Psychologists have been concerned for many years in evaluating the effect of Northern exposure on mental performance on tests.
The 1930's saw significant research on the borders of sociology, psychology and anthropology, notably by Franz Boas, his former student, Otto Klineberg, later professor at Columbia, and Ruth Benedict. I had the good fortune to earn a master's degree at Columbia in a joint study with Elsie Wallach (1932) under Dr. Klineberg.
That study, of 314 Binet I.Q. (intelligent quotient) tests of 10-year-old African-American boys and girls who migrated North from the South, compared with New York City children, showed a valid, conclusive, significant rise in I.Q. the longer Southerners went into the superior schools of the North.
Clearly, the total environment, school and society, economic and psychological, was in the 1920's and early 30's superior to the schooling and social environment of the South. This might not be true today!
Evidence from the psychological studies of the 1930's gives credence to Mr. Duneier's thesis that black migrants have done better and may help dispel the mythologies that continue to surround the study of race in this country.

HEADLINE: Saving a New England 'Grande Dame'

BYLINE: By GLENN RIFKIN

DATELINE: BRETTON WOODS, N.H. June 26

 BODY:
The Mount Washington Hotel, the majestic 89-year-old structure that was the site of the Bretton Woods international monetary conference in 1944 and once a summer playground for the Vanderbilts, Astors and Rockefellers, was auctioned by banking regulators today and sold for $3.15 million to a group of local New Hampshire investors. They pledged to preserve the historic hotel while preparing it for the next century.
"This is not a bell tolling for the grande dame of the White Mountains," said Wayne Mock, the auctioneer, as he opened the bidding on the venerable 250-room hotel and resort that has had a history of ups and downs and was rescued from bankruptcy today and the clutches of the New England banking crisis. 
 The hotel where world economic leaders established monetary cooperation, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, was seized by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation last year. That is when the hotel's latest owners, the Eliot Savings Bank in Boston and its subsidiary, Eliot Partners Inc., failed. Eliot Savings had lent the subsidiary $7 million to run the hotel. The F.D.I.C. foreclosed on the property last month to set up the auction.
From the beginning, the success of the hotel, the largest structure in New Hampshire, seemed in doubt -- even on its opening night in 1902. Joseph Stickney, a New Hampshire coal baron who built the hotel, raised a toast that night "to the damn fool who built this white elephant." Mr. Stickney, according to a local historian, George McAvoy, built the hotel with the aid of 250 Italian laborers because he wanted to give something back to the state.
Eventually, Mrs. Stickney managed to convince her socialite friends to visit the hotel and it became a favorite for movie stars, sports heroes like Babe Ruth, and dignitaries like Winston Churchill.
The hotel fell into disrepair and was closed in 1943 when World War II cut off needed supplies. Then President Franklin D. Roosevelt chose it as the site of the world monetary conference. More than $1 million was poured into the hotel to prepare it for the conference, at which the gold standard was set and the dollar standardized as the international currency. Today's sale was completed on the same mahogany table in the room where the conference took place.
The new owners face a costly job, with estimates of needed repairs exceeding $10 million. The hotel, which is open from May to October, needs a 55 percent occupancy rate to break even, said Joel Bedor, the head of the investment group that purchased the property. He said the group planned to winterize the hotel to keep it open year-round.
Mr. Bedor and his partner, Wayne Presby, also own and operate the nearby Mount Washington Cog Railway, a leading tourist attraction that takes passengers to the top of Mount Washington, the highest mountain in New England. They said the hotel would fit into an overall plan to take advantage of ski resorts and local New Hampshire beauty to make the investment profitable.
The auction, which attracted five bidders and news media from as far as Sweden, included the hotel, two neighboring ski lodges and a restaurant -- a parcel totaling 97 acres in the Presidential Range in Mount Washington Valley.
The F.D.I.C. had already pumped $1.2 million into the hotel to prepare it for this year's summer season. The decision to open was not made until late March, said Charles Nehme, the hotel's manager, and he and his staff were given two weeks to prepare. Mr. Nehme said the hotel was profitable in 1989 but fell into disrepair in 1990, when its owners ran into financial trouble.
The new owners, which have set up the Mountain Properties Preservation Corporation, tried to buy the property six months ago, but were rebuffed by the F.D.I.C. Mr. Presby said the group was "very pleased with the price of the hotel," which had been appraised at a higher price by the Property Research Group of Boston, a real estate appraisal firm.
Mitchell Ashear, liquidation manager for the F.D.I.C.'s office in Franklin, Mass., would not disclose the appraised value of the properties but said he was pleased with the sale price. "Driving up here, I had no idea what to expect, but I didn't think we would get this price," he said.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Closes Mostly Higher But Declines Against Yen

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar finished higher yesterday against all major currencies except the Japanese yen.
Gold prices mostly declined. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery settled at $366 an ounce, unchanged from Wednesday. The Republic National Bank said gold slipped 20 cents an ounce, to a late bid of $365.80. 
 Despite the dollar's gains, many investors were disappointed that the currency did not put in an even stronger showing, given new information that underscored the economy's emergence from the recession.
 
Three Reports
 The Labor Department reported that the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell by 17,000 in the second week of June. The Commerce Department said consumer spending surged 1.1 percent and personal income rose five-tenths of a percent in May.
In Tokyo, the dollar rose to a closing 138.65 Japanese yen, from 138.53 yen on Wednesday. But later in London, it fell to 138.10 yen, and in New York, the dollar settled at 137.80 yen, down from 138.28 yen on Wednesday.
Many investors were motivated to buy the dollar because of the unrest in Yugoslavia. The dollar is historically seen as an investment haven during world turmoil.
Randolph Donney, research director at the Pegasus Econometric Group in Hoboken, N.J., noted, however, that the dollar was unable to rise above the critical level of 1.80 German marks.
In London, the British pound fell to $1.6325, from $1.6390 late on Wednesday. In New York, it cost $1.6325 to buy a pound, less than Wednesday's $1.6385.
Other late dollar rates in New York compared with late Wednesday's rates included: 1.7950 German marks, up from 1.7873; 1.5503 Swiss francs, up from 1.5474; 6.0890 French francs, up from 6.0685; 1,336.50 Italian lire, up from 1,332.75, and 1.1428 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1421.
Gold fell in London to a late bid of $365.25 an ounce, from $366.30 late Wednesday. In Zurich, gold fell to a closing bid of $365.00, from $366.50. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold fell 54 cents, to $365.82.
Silver prices were unchanged to higher. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, silver for current delivery settled at $4.385 an ounce, up from $4.355 on Wednesday. In London, silver was unchanged at a late bid of $4.37.

HEADLINE: FOR CHILDREN

BYLINE: By Dulcie Leimbach

 BODY:
What a paradise Central Park can seem! Especially this summer, when the recession threatens New York City's cultural institutions. In the last few years, the park has developed free children's programs from hat-making workshops to a wake-up aviary tour. These activities -- especially the ones conducted by the Urban Park Rangers, whose numbers were recently depleted by layoffs -- are likely to suffer. But some of the park's more interesting spots are used for workshops and adventurous pursuits, some of them sponsored by the Central Park Conservancy and others by the Department of Parks and Recreation, that will be offered this weekend and
should be in place
for the summer. Call the Parks Department at (800) 834-3832 to check on any last-minute changes. In any case, there's always the Sheep
Meadow, if all that's wanted is some splendor in the grass. 

 
Belvedere Castle
 79th Street, west side of the park, south of the Great Lawn
 Recommended ages for workshops: 5 to 11
 (212) 772-0210
 Tomorrow
Belvedere Castle stands on top of craggy Vista Rock like an imperious mother, looking down on the childlike Belvedere Lake below. You have to climb a seemingly endless trail of stairs; don't even think of going up with baby strollers. Restored in 1982, the castle is now surrounded by shrubs, grasses, meadows and flowers, and seems to have been created as a setting for a dark Bavarian fairy tale in which love is lost and never found. It often serves as the meeting point for family workshops or adventures, also sponsored by the Central Park Conservancy. But nothing too sinister or frightening happens.
Tomorrow "Ninja Turtles vs. Park Turtles" will be the topic of a discussion led by Allen Salzberg of the New York Turtle and Tortoise Society. Mr. Salzberg will begin by asking what Ninjas eat, where they live, how they protect themselves, where they get their skills and why they say "Cowabunga, dude!" Children, naturally, will have all the answers. Then Mr. Salzberg will ask them about real turtles and, presuming the audience will not be as informed about these creatures, he will fill in the blanks. Real live turtles will be on hand for children to draw. The free workshop, which runs from 1 to 2:30 P.M., requires registration. Adults need to remain with their children. All materials are included.
 
Urban Park Rangers
 Walks and talks
 (212) 427-4040
 Recommended ages: 8 and up
 Sunday
The Urban Park Rangers are kindly experts on the history, design, geology, wildlife and botany of the city's parks. On weekends, in the large city parks, the rangers conduct tours and workshops -- walking, nature, sky gazing, you name it -- that not only enlighten children but also instill respect for igneous rocks, centipedes and trees like viburnum.
The rangers also have a sense of humor and of romance. On Sunday, they will inspire participants with poetry, the nature kind, with a workshop called "Kindred Spirits." The rangers will lead a walk while reading selections from Shakespeare to Whitman, but they ask that participants bring their own, too, including original poems. The walk will start at 100th Street and Central Park West at 2 P.M. and end up at the Sheep Meadow about two hours later.

 West side of Conservatory Water, entrance at 72d Street and Fifth Avenue
 (800) 834-3832 or (212) 794-6564
 Recommended ages: 5 and up
 Saturdays through Sept. 28
For 34 years stories have been told under the paternal, almost melancholy eye of the Hans Christian Andersen statue. The large bronze sculpture, which is kept company by an attractive Ugly Duckling, was financed with the pennies of Danish and American schoolchildren and Danish businessmen to keep the spirit of Denmark alive in New York City. Installed in 1956, the site is a literary cul-de-sac at the otherwise buzzing boat pond.
Diane Wolkstein, a professional storyteller and writer who leads the program, was first given an audition for the job in 1967 by the Baroness Ida-Gro Dahlerup, a Dane whose mother had proposed the statue. Children and adults (who are asked to remain during the storytelling hour) sit on chairs provided by the Parks Department while Ms. Wolkstein spins stories from memory, with a dash of improvisation. Tomorrow's story is "The Emperor's New Clothes." The readings begin at 11 A.M. and last about an hour.
 
The Dairy
Midpark at 65th Street, north of Wollman Rink
 (212) 794-6564; Friday and Saturday afternoons, (212) 794-6565
 Recommended ages for workshops: 5 to 11
Tomorrow
The Dairy is so charming and quaint that you look back at it as you walk away to make sure it's real. With its Hudson River Gothic style and romantic loggia -- which offers a good escape from the sun -- the Dairy seems to have been pulled out of an Edith Wharton story. In fact, it was built in 1870 -- about 20 years before Wharton published her first collection of stories -- to distribute fresh milk to children. Nowadays, it's the locale for Central Park Conservancy's free family workshops. It's also a restful visitors' center with a 12-foot model of the park under glass inside. Under the loggia is a map of Central Park to help you get your bearings.
Tomorrow's workshop is "Design-a-Park." Participants will become landscape architects by role playing and enacting the events that led up to the creation of Central Park. Some will be asked to play Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux, the masterminds who designed the park. Even adults may test their acting skills by becoming, say, the person who dynamites boulders. Then, under the tutelage of the Master Stonebuilder (Dina Friedman, the assistant manager of the Dairy), children will be challenged to create their own three-dimensional parks out of recycled materials, paper, crayons and markers. There may even be a ribbon-cutting ceremony at the end. If the weather is fair, the workshop, which is from 1:30 to 3 P.M., will be held under the loggia. Adults are asked to stay with the children during the entire workshop, and reservations are required.

HEADLINE: World Bank Pact Seen On Private-Sector Policy

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 27

 BODY:
Executive directors of the World Bank have reached a tentative agreement in a bitter dispute over whether the international lending agency should do more to help the private sector in the developing world, Administration and World Bank officials said today.
The 22 directors will vote on the agreement at a 10 A.M. meeting Friday, the officials said. A vote in favor would resolve, for now, a rancorous division between the United States and most other countries over whether an increase in World Bank lending to private businesses would better help the three billion people living in the world's poor countries than bank lending to state-run projects.
 
Essentially Revives U.S. Proposal
 The agreement essentially revives a United States-backed proposal that the bank's board refused to endorse at a bitter meeting on June 20. That plan called for modest changes in the management structure to make bank officials more aware of private-sector considerations. The United States has insisted on the changes as its price for contributing $250 million of a $1 billion rise in the capital of the bank's private-sector lending arm. 
 Some delegates at that meeting, notably those from northern Europe, contended that the bank might be abandoning its goal of alleviating poverty in order to help some politically connected third-world business executives.
A senior Treasury official who asked not to be identified said the directors agreed to back the United States plan in return for a pledge by the United States to support a policy statement that the alleviation of poverty remains the bank's primary goal. The Treasury Department represents the United States in World Bank deliberations.
A World Bank director who does not represent the United States confirmed that an agreement had been reached. The director spoke on condition that he remained anonymous.
The agreement came after a week of informal negotiations among small groups of executive directors seeking a consensus. Some directors agreed reluctantly, the Treasury official said.
The main change under the agreement involves the creation of a committee to conduct quarterly reviews of the bank's progress in encouraging the private sector in the third world. The bank's president would be the committee's chairman. The bank would also hire 20 executives to monitor this progress, and would review the effect of the bank's lending on the balance between the public and private sectors in 20 countries.
Finally, the directors have agreed that the staff of the bank should review its charter and determine whether it allows adequate flexibility in lending to third-world businesses.

Chasing Yields In Mutual Funds

BYLINE: By Alison Leigh Cowan

 BODY:
FRUSTRATED with money market yields, investors continued this month to seek out slightly riskier, higher-yielding bond funds and more conservative stock funds, investment managers said this week.
Two big winners appear to be those funds that specialize in either Federal agency obligations or long-term Treasury securities. Those funds are considered good values because they are only slightly riskier than money market funds and yet offer yields that are two to three percentage points higher. 
 "Especially as interest rates have come down, people have focused on getting the highest income they can, income that short-term instruments like certificates of deposit are not providing anymore," said Richard Barone, the chairman of the Maxus Investment Group in Cleveland.
Mr. Barone's company sells its products directly to the public. But even mutual fund sponsors that sell their products through brokers, and therefore are slower to feel some trends, have noticed how sensitive to yield investors have suddenly become.
"There's been some opportunities in the bond market to capture higher returns than people are seeing from money market funds," said Steve Radis, a spokesman for Kemper Financial Services Inc. in Chicago, whose products are sold through brokers. He noted that Kemper's money market fund was yielding 5.68 percent, slightly higher than conventional savings accounts, while its United States Government Fund, which invests in agency obligations and Treasury securities, yields 9.01 percent.
At the same time that investors are accepting a slight increase in risk on the bond side, managers say that with investors remaining cautious about the sputtering economy, there has been a noticeable shift away from the highly speculative stock funds that proved so popular in the heady days after the Persian Gulf war.
"The theme you're seeing is while the small investor is still committed to the stock market, they're taking a slightly more conservative approach to it," said Neal Litvack, a vice president of marketing for Fidelity Investments in Boston. "The growth and income funds and the larger brand-name funds like Magellan are definitely the major recipients of the new equity sales dollars this month, and that contrasts with the three months prior when small-cap funds and sector funds were the most popular."
Even before this week's reports, the year was shaping up as one of the best ever for bond funds, a report released yesterday by the Investment Company Institute confirms.
 According to the institute, $5 billion poured into bond funds in May, when all new purchases, redemptions and transfers among funds are counted. That net cash flow figure was down slightly from the $6 billion that came in April. Nonetheless, it means that a total of $21 billion has poured into bond funds so far this year, more than twice the $8.5 billion those funds attracted in all of 1990.
Equity funds surged by $3.5 billion in May, versus the $2.9 billion increase reported in April, the institute said. Of that, $1.3 billion flowed into growth-stock funds and only $762 million into aggressive stock funds, a shift in preference that seems to have intensified in the last few weeks.
Interestingly, one area where investors generally seem unwilling to expose themselves to higher credit risk, even in exchange for higher yields is in the tax-exempt municipal area.
Though municipal bond funds are selling well because of growing concerns about higher taxes, investors have favored the nationally diversified funds, which are only tax-exempt at the Federal level, over the state-specificfunds, which typically offer additional tax savings to residents of the state that issued the municipal bonds. Fund managers attribute that preference to the well-publicized problems of Bridgeport, Conn., Philadelphia, New York and other cities and states.
"What's interesting is people who have high state tax rates have chosen to forgo the additional tax savings at the state level to insure credit quality or lack of credit risk," Mr. Litvack said. "The more popular funds right now are nationally diversified. They're not state-specific funds, and much of that is because of problems New York, Connecticut and Massachusetts are having."

HEADLINE: Oil Production At 5-Year Low

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: HOUSTON, June 27

 BODY:
Domestic oil production in 1990 declined to the lowest point in five years, according to an oil and gas survey released today.
Production declined for the fifth straight year, falling 5 percent, to two billion barrels, said the 1991 Arthur Andersen Oil & Gas Reserve Disclosures survey. Spending for oil and gas exploration and development outside the United States reached a high of $20.9 billion last year, the survey said. 
 Also last year, United States gas production increased for the fifth year in a row, reaching 10.3 trillion cubic feet.
"Both the major oil and gas companies and independents are focusing their exploration efforts either on high-potential foreign prospects or on areas in the U.S. where they can gain a competitive advantage through advanced drilling technology, operating efficiencies or economies of scale," said Victor A. Burk, managing director of the oil and gas industry services for Arthur Andersen.

HEADLINE: Report on Foreign Aid

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: TOKYO, June 27

 BODY:
The United States surpassed Japan as the world's leader in foreign economic aid in 1990, partly because the yen fell in value, the Foreign Ministry said Wednesday. Japan had passed the United States as the world's largest aid donor in 1989, when it provided $8.97 billion, compared with $7.7 billion from the United States. The ministry, quoting preliminary statistics compiled by the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, said Japan disbursed $9.24 billion in official development assistance in 1990. The amount was behind the United States' estimated $10 billion and ahead of third-place France's $6.5 billion, it said.

HEADLINE: Bank Fund Outlook Is Bleaker

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 27

 BODY:
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation said today that the fund that protects bank deposits would need to borrow more than previously expected this year because it is short of cash.
L. William Seidman, chairman of the F.D.I.C., said in his latest estimate that the liquidity problem meant the fund would have to borrow at least $4 billion more in 1991 than the $14.5 billion estimated in January and that it was likely to become insolvent some time in 1992. 
 The fund, which protects deposits of up to $100,000, was worth $18.3 billion in 1987 but has been battered by the growing number of large bank failures.
 
Reserves Are Lower
 "We have to borrow more heavily because we have much less in the way of reserves," Mr. Seidman told reporters after he testified at a House Budget Committee hearing. "We are now borrowing for the working capital on all transactions."
Mr. Seidman said that he did not expect the fund would be insolvent until sometime in 1992 but that since most of the fund's assets are not readily marketable, the fund was forced to borrow more.
Politically, the plight of the insurance fund is viewed as critical to the survival of the Administration's banking legislation. To the extent that lawmakers see the fund as needing immediate attention, they are more likely to provide new money quickly and less likely to complete action on the Administration's broad legislation that would permit banks to expand into different businesses and across state lines.
Some Democrats on Capitol Hill have asserted that the Administration is seeking to underplay the deteriorating condition of the fund until after the 1992 elections.
 
'A Continuing Black Hole'
 "All of the estimates on the size of the problem have not turned out to be accurate," said Representative Leon E. Panetta, Democrat of California and chairman of the Budget Committee. "The banking crisis appears to be a continuing black hole. What we would like to know today is how deep, how long, how much."
As part of the legislative package, the Administration has asked that the fund be kept afloat by increasing its borrowing authority to $70 billion from $5 billion. The loans, $25 billion of which would come from the Treasury, would be repaid through bank contributions and the sales of assets from collapsed institutions taken over by the Government.
In addition to the fund's $5 billion credit line to the Treasury, it also has the authority to borrow up to nine times its net worth. The House Banking Committee is completing a measure that would permit the fund to borrow $30 billion from the Treasury and an additional sum based on the amount of assets seized by regulators from failed institutions.
The Banking Committee spent most of today on the legislation, failing to meet its schedule for completing work on the package. The chairman of the committee, Representative Henry B. Gonzalez, Democrat of Texas, said the panel would return on Friday with the hope of completing work on the bill.
Mr. Seidman, who has endorsed most of the Administration's package, said Congress should provide new money for the insurance fund by the end of the year.
At latest count, the insurance corporation listed 1,030 banks, with assets of $430.8 billion, as likely to fail. Never have so many troubled assets been on the F.D.I.C.'s problem list, a sign that the larger banks, particularly in the Northeast, have been facing greater difficulties, largely because of commercial real estate loans that have soured.
The bank insurance fund is now at its lowest level compared to deposits since its creation in 1934, though there is significant disagreement about its net worth. Government auditors have said the fund is virtually insolvent. Mr. Seidman, lowering an earlier figure, said today that it was worth between $8.4 billion and $6.4 billion at the end of 1990, depending upon the resolution of a disagreement between the F.D.I.C. and auditors at the General Accounting Office.
Mr. Seidman said that so far 1991 had been a better year than expected, but that 1992 would be significantly worse than previously anticipated.
 
Short-term Improvement
 He said that based on the first-quarter results of 1991, he expected the insurance fund to be worth about $3.2 billion and not likely to be lower than $1.7 billion at the end of this year. He said that significant losses next year were likely to leave it with a negative net worth of $3 billion to $11 billion.
"Short term we are experiencing fewer failures and lower costs than previously predicted," Mr. Seidman said. "However, our expectations for 1992 have dampened and are less favorable."
He once again rejected assertions that regulators were leaving weak banks open to retain the insurance fund's existing net worth.

HEADLINE: More Signs of Waning Recession in May Consumer Data

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
Consumers apparently had the wallet and the will to spend their way out of recession last month, a Government report issued yesterday said.
The Commerce Department report showing that consumer spending surged 1.1 percent in May prompted the President's chief economic adviser, Michael J. Boskin, to declare again, less equivocally than he had in the past, that the recession was over. 
 "These figures are further evidence that a recovery is under way," Mr. Boskin said.
The level of consumer spending in May was $41.8 billion, the highest monthly amount since last fall. The increase, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $3.8 trillion, followed a revised four-tenths of 1 percent contraction in April.
Consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of the nation's economy, which fell into recession according to traditional definitions when the gross national product registered two straight quarters of contraction -- a 1.6 percent drop in the fourth period of 1990 and a 2.8 percent decline in the first period of 1991.
Yesterday's Commerce Department report also showed that Americans' personal incomes before taxes rose one-half of 1 percent in May, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $4.78 trillion. It was the biggest monthly advance this year and the fourth straight monthly gain since January.
The income advance cheered private economic forecasters, who took it as a sign that the rebound in consumer spending would continue.
"A virtuous cycle has set in," said Robert Giordano, director of economic research at Goldman Sachs & Company. "Income growth will tend to support spending by stimulating more production."
The burst of spending was broad-based, encompassing everything from clothes to cars to services.
The stronger car buying followed a decline in April that dragged total consumer spending down by $15.2 billion in the month. Robert Dennis, an economist at the Congressional Budget Office, said he thought car buying would show another rise in June. Sales of new cars in the first 20 days of this month are running ahead of the May level.
Yesterday's report also showded that the savings rate of consumers fell in May to 3.6 percent of after-tax income, from 4 percent in April. The decline was the fourth since January, when the rate was 4.5 percent, and the May rate was the lowest since September, when it was 3.5 percent.
But economists took the lower savings rate as a positive sign.
"That suggests that consumers are confident and that they feel better about their balance sheets, especially home prices," said Mr. Dennis of the Congressional Budget Office.
A Labor Department report yesterday also showed that intial claims for unemployment insurance fell in the second week of June, to 431,000, after an increase in the previous week.
The recession will not be declared officially over by the Business Cycle Dating Committee of the National Bureau of Economic Research for months to come. But Mr. Boskin cited encouraging "coincident indicators" that the committee usually uses to help mark the end of recessions.
 
Some Turning Points
 For example, the number of Americans on payrolls, Mr. Boskin said, reached its low point in April; industrial production and store and factory sales touched bottom in March, and, according to today's report, Americans' incomes reached a trough in February.
The data could yet be revised, which is one reason the business cycle committee holds off its final pronouncement for a time. But Mr. Boskin's analysis of the current data suggests that the recession may have ended in April or May.
Since the recession of 1990-91 was more shallow than most, Mr. Boskin said, the recovery is likely to be modest by past standards. The next indicator of the recovery's momentum will come a week from Friday, when the Labor Department will report on the number of jobs gained or lost and hours worked in June, which is the first clue of whether incomes rose or fell in the month.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Outweek, Gay and Lesbian Magazine, Ceases Publication

BYLINE: By DEIRDRE CARMODY

 BODY:
Outweek, the New York-based gay and lesbian magazine, ceased publication this week as a result of infighting among its principals and because it could not pay its bills, officials of the magazine said yesterday.
A notice signed by Kendall Morrison, president and co-founder of the magazine and its majority shareholder, was tacked to the locked office door yesterday telling staff members that the magazine was closed but expressing the hope that it would publish again soon. 
 Calls to Steven Polakoff, a Florida realtor who is listed as publisher, were not returned.
Mr. Morrison, who said he is hospitalized with AIDS, said in a telephone interview yesterday that Mr. Polakoff was no longer the magazine's publisher.
"One of my partners, Steven Polakoff, resigned as publisher and then went and started illegally seizing my assets and withholding them from me," Mr. Morrison said.
The magazine, with offices at 159 West 25th Street, was founded two years ago this week by Mr. Morrison and Gabriel Rotello, who became editor in chief. Outweek established itself from the start as the most progressive of the gay publications. Its controversial practice of "outing" -- exposing public figures who are gay and lesbian -- and its support of Act-Up and Queer Nation, two activist gay organizations, brought it national notoriety.
In December Mr. Polakoff took over daily control of the magazine from Mr. Morrison. Earlier this month Mr. Rotello was dismissed as editor in chief by Mr. Polakoff over differences in management and over what the tone of the magazine should be. Mr. Rotello said yesterday that the magazine had been losing thousands of dollars a week and was "enormously in debt."
"Steve Polakoff didn't know anything about the publishing business," Mr. Rotello said, noting that the magazine went from being "slightly in the red" to much more in the red.
 
Efforts to Save Magazine
 Mr. Rotello said that in an effort to return the magazine to a sound financial footing, he drew up an austerity plan that would have dismissed about one-third of the 27 employees. As a result staff members then demanded his ouster and he was dismissed by Mr. Polakoff.
People familiar with the gay press throughout the country say that Outweek gave voice to a new generation of AIDS activists who had not previously had a public voice and provided a rallying point for the more militant members of the gay community.
The magazine's circulation is not audited and its executives give varying numbers for it, somewhere in the 30,000 to 40,000 range.
Joe Di Sabato, president of Rivendell Marketing Company, a firm that represents 175 gay publications to advertisers, said that the financial problems of Outweek should not be seen as typical of the financial health of the gay press in general. He said that Outweek's controversial policies made it difficult for the magazine to generate sufficient revenues.
"Gay papers in general are probably making more money than ever, despite the recession," he said. "Outweek, however, had the effect of shaking up a lot of gay publications out of their complacency."

HEADLINE: Weekly U.S. Jobless Claims Down by 17,000 in Mid-June

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 27

 BODY:
The number of Americans filing new unemployment claims declined in the second week of June, the Labor Department reported today, supporting hopes the nation's jobs market is on the upswing.
For the week ended June 15, some 431,000 Americans filed new claims for unemployment, 17,000 fewer than the previous week's 448,000. 
 Jobless claims had been on a downward trend during May but surged 47,000 in the first week of June.
"That trend was interrupted briefly," said David Jones, an economist with Aubrey G. Lanston & Company. "But it has been trending lower, suggesting that at least in some sectors, the jobs market is improving."
Robert Dederick, chief economist at the Northern Trust Company of Chicago, said, "We're having a gradual ebbing, and that's consistent with the idea of recovery and further evidence that it's manifesting itself in a better labor market."
 
Recovery in Economy Seen
 The jobless-claims report, which can be erratic from week to week, helps economists analyze whether companies are adding or laying off workers. The latest number shows that jobs are probably on the rise, but only slightly, said Sam Kahan, chief financial economist at Fuji Securities.
"Things are unfolding pretty much per script," he said. "The U.S. economy is in the process of recovery, and the recovery appears, at least today, to be modest and anemic."
Many analysts played down the early-June spurt because it was the week following Memorial Day, which could have caused more people to wait a week to file. Others, however, said it raised fresh doubts about the recovery.
The 431,000-level is a marked improvement over March levels, when claims topped the 500,000 mark for three straight weeks and peaked at 550,000.
In another sign of an improved labor market, the percentage of the nation's labor force who were receiving unemployment benefits for the week ended June 8 decreased to 3.3 percent, from 3.4 percent, as the number of recipients fell by 105,000 to 3.5 million.
The state posting the biggest decrease in jobless claims during the second week of June was Illinois, where first-time claims fell about 6,100, as a result of improvements in manufacturing services and the wholesale and retail trade sectors.
California's initial jobless claims fell about 3,500 because of increased hiring in agriculture and electronics. Missouri, the only state with a big increase in claims -- about 2,300 -- attributed the new claims to layoffs in transportation and public utilities.

Kohlberg, Kravis Planning Cable Venture

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT

 BODY:
Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company and Cablevision Industries Inc. are considering investing $250 million and borrowing another $750 million to buy cable systems, David Testa, Cablevision's vice president, said yesterday.
"Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts had been looking to get into the cable market and our expertise includes management of systems," Mr. Testa said. Cablevision, which is based in Liberty, N.Y., would manage the systems that are acquired. 
 Kohlberg, Kravis would put up $215 million and Cablevision Industries $35 million.
 
Hunting the 'Best Systems'
 "Given all the aspects of the market as it exists today, this may be a propitious time to get back into cable," Mr. Testa said.
Cablevision is the 10th-largest cable company in the country with 1.1 million subscribers in 18 states, primarily along the Eastern seaboard but also in Los Angeles. It is not affiliated with the Cablevision Systems Corporation of Woodbury, L.I., which provides cable services including Sportschannel.
Mr. Testa said Cablevision Industries and Kohlberg, Kravis were not committed to buying systems contiguous to ones Cablevision already owns. He added: "Given the pool of acquisition money, the company is well positioned to target the best systems over all for acquisition."
Despite the recession and the fact that cable stocks have been hurt by investors' concerns about the debt they have taken on to expand, the cable business itself is healthy and cash flows have not been badly hurt. While advertising revenues at the television networks have been under pressure, ad revenues for cable have remained strong.
Stocks of some major cable companies rose yesterday, with Tele-Communications Inc., the nation's largest cable operator, up 50 cents, to $14.50, and the Comcast Corporation up $1, to $14.75.
Trading in media properties in general has picked up lately, sparked in part by Kohlberg, Kravis's own activities. Its K-III Holdings recently bought a group of magazines from Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation for about $650 million.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Soft Landing, Soft Recovery?

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
IS the recession over? Has the recovery begun? At least to the nation's most influential economic prophet, Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, these are not two sides of the same question but two separate questions.
During his Congressional testimony last week, Mr. Greenspan answered the first question by saying that although the data might be revised up or down, "it's very difficult to get around the data of the last several weeks, which are strongly suggestive that the bottom is somewhere in the second quarter." Michael J. Boskin, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, took the same position yesterday. 
 Since the second quarter ends this weekend, even with minimal Greenspanian and Boskinian hedging, the recession is officially over.
But on the second question, of whether the recovery has begun, Mr. Greenspan said, "We don't yet see any measurable upward thrust." To non-economists, especially workers still looking for jobs or businesses hoping to escape failure, an economy that has not started to recover is still in recession.
But the Government's caution on the recovery is consistent with the consensus forecast of private economists that the recovery will be sluggish and weaker than most recoveries. The economists seem to have a principle similar to Sir Isaac Newton's third law of motion: that "action and reaction are equal and opposite."
Hence, most expect the soft landing of 1989-90 to be followed by the soft recovery of 1991-92. Neal M. Soss, managing director and chief economist of the First Boston Corporation, said in Tokyo earlier this month: "Although a dispute within the Fed over short-run monetary policy tactics attracted much notoriety this spring, I think there was always a strong consensus at the Fed on strategy for the economy: The same people at the Fed who implemented the soft landing in 1989 and 1990 are now intent on delivering a soft takeoff in 1991 and 1992."
The Fed's slowness to ease in the last few months, he said, is intended to avoid giving the economy too vigorous a recovery, lest it regenerate inflation. "The Fed doesn't want to give the economy any more boost than is absolutely necessary to clear the treetops," he said.
In his Congressional testimony, Mr. Greenspan seemed to reinforce this, saying he was "confident that we can come out of this with a recovery without reigniting inflationary forces, which inevitably, within a reasonably short period, create the next recession."
But many economists see other reasons than Fed policy for expecting a subpar recovery. Greg A. Smith of Prudential Securities summarizes the case for a slower-than-usual recovery as involving tax increases from state and local governments, little or no stimulus from the Federal Government's fiscal policies, a slower rate of increase in exports and a consumer lacking "the wherewithal to mount a sustained important increase in consumer spending."
Some economists even expect the economy, after a short spurt of growth, to relapse into recession, in what is being called a "double-dip" or "W-shaped" pattern. Adolphe Warner, economic consultant to the Deutsche Bank, said the double-dip forecast is gaining ground, and spreading a "holy fear that, though the third quarter may be up or neutral, the fourth quarter will be down again."
Their feared model is what happened in 1980-83, when the economy slumped, recovered, slumped and recovered again in a perfect W. A former Fed economist, Roger Kubarych, who is now with Henry Kaufman & Company, said in an interview yesterday that the two recessions of that period should be regarded as one "engineered by the Fed to wrench inflation out of the system."
But Mr. Kubarych does not think the present and the 1980-83 period are comparable. "We don't have the inflation now," he said. He does, however, expect a sluggish recovery, and he sees the possibility that the economy will move ahead in fits and starts, hampered by the inability of the financial system to support a more vigorous recovery.
Though the recession appears to be generally over, some industries, including housing, banking, savings and loans, insurance, publishing, retailing, the airlines and computers, are still plagued by structural problems or hampered by weaknesses in other sectors.
The economy is like a vast network or matrix. Troubles in one industry cause troubles in others: The computer industry depends on banks, insurance, retailing and the airlines. Publishing, hard hit by a falloff in advertising, depends on financial services, retailing, airlines and computers.
The recovery now getting under way must still overcome such structural resistance. But there appears to be little reason to expect an inflationary upsurg or tightening of Fed policy that would cause the recovery to collapse.
Financial strains are likely to make the expansion slower than usual. But, barring a worsening credit squeeze, unlikely with an election year ahead, the recovery, after an 11-month recession, appears destined to follow through -- like nearly all the cyclical recoveries before it.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Silo's Account Is Awarded To Unit of Saatchi & Saatchi

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
SILO INC., the country's second-largest consumer electronics and home-appliance chain, yesterday handed Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising North America its estimated $75 million account. It has previously handled almost all its advertising in-house.
The unexpected announcement gives Saatchi an account that will be "well up there, one of our top 10," a delighted Edward L. Wax, the agency's president and chief executive, said in a telephone interview. If the billings estimate by industry executives is accurate, Silo's spending would equal what a retailer like the J. C. Penney Company spends annually on national advertising. 
 Silo operates 232 stores in 21 states from its headquarters in Philadelphia and has annual sales of $1 billion, ranking it second behind the industry leader, Circuit City Stores Inc., which has sales of $2.4 billion.
Both Silo and Saatchi are subsidiaries of British companies that do business together at home. Silo is owned by Dixons Group P.L.C., which operates consumer electronics stores in Britain. The Dixons account is handled by Saatchi's parent, Saatchi & Saatchi P.L.C. of London.
Indeed, it was advertising produced by the British agency for the British retailer that helped lead to yesterday's announcement. "We certainly have demonstrated to Silo our creative ability," Mr. Wax said of the British work, "and we're learning from that model."
Silo's initial foray into moving to an outside agency came in July, when Saatchi & Saatchi DFS Pacific, in Torrance, Calif., was hired to handle Silo's entrance into the Southern California market. A $5 million campaign, with the theme, "The Silos are coming!" was "tremendously effective in terms of generating traffic" in Silo stores, Mr. Wax said.
Silo's strategy in the current difficult retail climate is "to get the maximum productivity from our present stores," Tony Dignum, the chain's president, said in a telephone interview, adding, "A key ingredient there is an effective advertising campaign."
While Silo was satisfied with its in-house work, he said, "it did not include a strong creative element, which is necessary to drive advertising programs."
Consumer electronics is a tumultuous and crowded field, with countless products and models in every category. It requires constantly changing print campaigns, as well as image-building broadcast campaigns.
Saatchi will be creating a torrent of advertising: hundreds of print ads a week, running in 125 daily newspapers; color inserts, also for newspapers, and television and radio commercials. The agency has previously created such campaigns for clients including Toyota and Burger King.
The competition is intensifying among consumer-electronics retailers for two reasons. More local chains are expanding across state borders. Since being acquired by Dixons in 1987, Silo has entered Chicago, Pittsburgh and other cities, as well as Los Angeles, though not the New York City area. And shoppers are not visiting these kinds of stores the way they used to, because of the recession and the lack of hot products like VCR's.
Silo's multistate presence is the reason why the account was awarded to Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising North America instead of to the Torrance office or to Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising, the New York office.
While the executive heading the account -- David Basch, an executive vice president and executive management director -- is based in New York, he will report to Richard O'Brien, vice chairman of the Saatchi North America unit.

Salomon Names Head Of European Banking

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH

 BODY:
As an investment banker in the United States, William H. Strong was an adviser to Sir James Goldsmith, the British-French financier, and Lord Hanson and Lord White, leaders of Hanson P.L.C. of Britain. Now, Mr. Strong, who is 39 years old, is hoping that his association with these Europeans will help him shine as the London-based head of European investment banking at Salomon Brothers, a job he will assume Sept. 1.
At least in mergers and acquisitions, Salomon seems to need a man with good contacts in Europe. Last year, Salomon was an adviser on only 15 cross-border deals involving the acquisition of European companies. The total value of the deals -- $2 billion -- ranked an unimpressive 19th, far behind Goldman, Sachs, which was No. 1, and sixth-ranked Morgan Stanley. according to Acquisitions Monthly, a British magazine. 
 "They're not on a par with firms like Goldman and Morgan Stanley in cross-border m. and a., but they're strong in certain markets like France and Spain," said Joanna Gant, deputy editor of Acquisitions Monthly.
Mr. Strong is now co-head of Salomon's global mergers and acquisitions operations in New York. In his new job, he will head a staff of 151 professionals in Europe, where he said he would be responsible for "the full range of investment-banking products that Salomon has to offer" in Europe.
He is succeeding Ronald M. Freeman, who is becoming a senior executive at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
Mr. Strong boasts that Salomon has a competitive advantage because of its big presence in financial centers around the world and the way it has organized its staff into industry specialists who can offer clients a full range of global services. These "franchises," he said, include energy, telecommunications, forest products, consumer products and retailing, chemicals, transportation and media. But some competitors are adopting a similar approach, he concedes.
"We very much see Europe as a growth area," he said. "Demand for our services in Europe exceeds supply right now."
He declined to break down what portion of Salomon's revenues and earnings come from Europe.
Mr. Strong graduated from Purdue, earned a master's degree in management from Northwestern and worked as an accountant and consultant at Price Waterhouse before joining Salomon in 1979.
He and his wife, Sandra, have three young children. What are his hobbies? "My biggest has been Salomon for the last 10 years," he said, adding that he also plays golf and skis. "One of the benefits" of his new job, he said, "is being closer to the slopes than you are in New York."

HEADLINE: City Council Budget Plan Resists Dinkins Cuts

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
As a bitter fiscal stalemate continued at City Hall, the New York City Council released an alternative city budget yesterday that rolled back $476 million in proposed tax increases and restored some of the biggest cuts proposed by Mayor David N. Dinkins to balance the recession-ravaged city budget. 
 The Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, said that the Council still hoped to reach an agreement with the Mayor on a common budget, but that if they could not agree, the Council would adopt its own version before the start of the city's new fiscal year on Monday.
The Council's move yesterday was a serious setback to the Dinkins administration on the eve of the layoffs of nearly 10,000 city workers who are due to report to work for their last time today. It followed an intensive effort by the administration to press city commissioners and community leaders to lobby the Council against its plan to cut city services.
Although Mr. Dinkins can challenge parts of the Council budget, his powers are restricted mainly to vetoing spending increases, meaning most of the Council's plan would go into effect.
The developments came as negotiations with municipal labor leaders remained stalled over concessions that could avert the need for some layoffs and as no apparent progress was made in efforts to get the State Legislature to approve $335 million in income-tax increases and $328 million in state aid and relief from state mandates.
 
Shadow of Control Board
 If the city fails to come up with a balanced budget soon, the State Financial Control Board could step in to oversee the city's finances, as it did during the city fiscal crisis of the mid-1970's.
The Council plan would at least partly reverse most of the more dramatic cuts highlighted by Mayor Dinkins in what had become known as his "doomsday budget" for city hospitals, museums, zoos, libraries, prenatal programs and drug treatment. And a Dinkins administration proposal to turn off one in four street lights was reversed.
But to pay for the restorations the Council planned more cuts aimed, it said, more at city management and less at essential services that could result in the cutting of more than 8,000 jobs on top of the 10,000 job losses proposed by the administration.
The plan also resorted to more than $150 million in higher estimates of revenues and to the use of surplus and reserve funds certain to be challenged by the administration in the days ahead. But the Council's action yesterday made it increasingly likely that most, if not all, of the restorations it proposed would be carried out.
"Yes, there are painful cuts in our document," Mr. Vallone, the Council Speaker, said at a budget briefing yesterday in a Council committee meeting room, flanked by his negotiating committee. "But we do not allow life-threatening cuts and we keep vital services and institutions intact."
The administration might complain about the Council's choices, he said, but "it is better to cut lawyers and middle-managers than school health programs and library branches."
 
Pressure From Landlords
 Dinkins administration officials have said they were willing to talk around the clock to resolve the budget dispute with the Council. But they made clear that any agreement would have to include far more than the $300 million in property-tax increases that the Council has already agreed to pass. The Council has been under heavy pressure from landlords and small homeowners, and Mr. Vallone, who represents a middle-class neighborhood in Queens, has long championed the interests of owners of small homes.
"What balances a budget on paper does not always balance it in practice," a solemn Mr. Dinkins said as he read a five-page statement at a City Hall news conference last night. "They've made purchases without putting down the check."
Mr. Dinkins then took credit for some of the restorations that the Council had adopted, and he assailed the Council for the additional cuts it called for, from the elimination of 3,000 summer jobs for teen-agers to the elimination of 80 traffic-control agents.
While Mr. Dinkins said the Council's plan called for 3,700 day-care slots to be cut, the Council said it hoped that cuts in day-care funds could be spread out across many programs and that no classrooms would have to be closed.
Since last October, the administration has struggled to stay ahead of worsening fiscal problems that have strained its resources and sapped its energies and forced the Mayor to acknowledge in a radio talk program yesterday that his best hope was to merely "tread water."
Mr. Dinkins cut short the radio interview to return to City Hall, saying, "I can't very well solve the problems of the city if I'm sitting here chatting on the radio while Rome is burning."
Asked last night at the news conference if city workers facing layoffs today would still be laid off, he grabbed the lectern with one hand, somberly nodded his head and said, "Yes."
As for the control board, even if its legal powers are not triggered, some state officials have talked about a bailout plan that would allow the city to stretch out budget cuts over several years by borrowing to cover deficits for the first time since the 1970's.
For the Council the preparation of the half-inch-thick amended budget showed new self-confidence a year after it received new budget powers under a revision to the City Charter.
The Council's budget staff, headed by Marc V. Shaw, a former State Senate budget aide, stayed up through most of the night preparing the document and a financial plan that shows how the Council's effort will maintain a balanced budget. The result was a budget plan that gave most Council members a politically appealing document, a budget that rescued both threatened tax increases and cuts to life-threatening city programs, and it appeared to have broad support among Council members.
The Council's briefing was not unlike countless budget briefings by mayors and budget directors over the years at City Hall, and at times Mr. Vallone sounded more like a representative of the executive branch than the legislative. He paused several times to remind reporters that he had no power to negotiate with municipal labor unions.
The Council's plan is vey likely to have an impact on negotiations with Albany and with the city's unions, especially if the Council convinces legislators and union leaders that it is serious about forgoing further tax increase.
For months, the unions have said they could not make concessions without knowing the parameters of the budget, including the level of tax increases. If they are convinced the Council cannot be budged, they might be willing to offer concessions.
But the Council plan also includes savings from a $130 million early-retirement program for nonuniformed city employees, in which the jobs of half the retirees would be dropped and half would be filled by lower-paid workers. The unions are hoping to use a similar plan to avert the need for layoffs of regular Civil Service employees.
State Senate Republicans have held up approving the income-tax rise proposed by the Mayor until they see the level of tax increases and government restructuring in the budget. The Council document issued yesterday may go a long way toward reassuring them.
The Council's plan would reduce property-tax increases by $476 million below the level called for by Mr. Dinkins's $28.7 billion budget and incresae spending by $220 million to restore some of the $1.5 billion in cuts called for by the Mayor.
These measures would be offset by about $700 million in other savings, including $330 million in cuts added by the Council, $120 million in savings from the early-retirement program and $19 million from a 1.5 percent cut in management at large city agencies.
 
Other Savings
 Other savings would come from $70 million in the nonpersonnel budget, including a $40 million saving from new professional purchasing units at large city agencies and a $20 million cut in consulting contracts.
In addition, the Council planned to spend a $50 million surplus it expected this year and $50 million out of $150 million in reserve funds the administration had set aside in its new budget.
Even before the Council put out its alternative budget yesterday, there were signs that at least some of the most damaging and life-threatening cuts proposed by Mayor Dinkins would not go forward.
Amid a flurry of lawsuits, the board of the city's Health and Hospitals Corporation decided yesterday to keep open city pharmacies, dental services and walk-in clinics at city hospitals. The move would save 409 jobs and cost $56 million that would have to be made up in other cuts.
The Council plan would provide funds for each of these programs, but only 40 percent of the funds lost in city pharmacies. But in lobbying against the cuts, city pharmacists said the city could make up the difference by setting up a new billing system.
If the pharmacies closed, doctors had threatened to admit patients needing only medications to hospital beds.

 Some of the programs that the City Council now proposes keeping that would have been severely cutg or eliminated under Mayor David N. Dinkins's doomsday budget proposal in May.
 Many of these restorations still would not bring these agencies' budgets back to what they currently receive. For example, the budget for libraries would be 90 percent of what they currently receive; the cultural figures would be about a third of their current budgets.

Chart: "The Budget Battles"
 
New York City: Nobody blinked. The City Council released its own version of the budget, restoring $220 million in cuts made by the Mayor but making about $330 million more, requiring at least 4,800 more layoffs than he did and 3,500 early retirements, and holding the property tax increase to $300 million. The Council threatened to approve its alternative budget by the July 1 legal deadline unless an agreement is struck with the Mayor.
The Dinkins administration prodded community groups and other constituents to lobby against the Council's cuts. Municipal unions, fuming over what they complained were administration constraints being placed on an early retirement plan, were pressed by the Mayor and Council to make contract concessions before the budget deadline.
 
Albany: The State Senate refused to budge on the city's request for authority to raise its income tax until the labor and property tax pieces of the city budget are resolved.
Albany's own financial picture was further clouded when the Court of Appeals invalidated a wage deferral plan imposed on state employees.
 
Connecticut
 Various options were floated to woo support for a compromise income tax package. One would slap an income tax on wages onto the current tax structure for dividends, interest and capital gains -- already among the highest such taxes in the nation.
That was denounced as a soak-the-rich plan, though, by the handful of Republicans whose votes are also considered crucial to a compromise.
 
New Jersey
 The General Assembly approved a plan that the Democratic Speaker, Joseph V. Doria, said would balance the budget without layoffs and without any new taxes. But the President of the State Senate, John A. Lynch, and Gov. Jim Florio still insisted that Assembly plan overestimated revenues and would bring down the state's bond rating. The vote was 43 to 36 along party lines.
 Behind closed doors, the Democratic leaders who control both houses were still trying to reach a compromise that would meet the constitutional requirement for a balanced budget by midnight Sunday. -- June 28, 1991

HEADLINE: Dinkins Goal: To Survive a Fiscal Quagmire

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
In the greatest challenge of his career, Mayor David N. Dinkins is waiting for a miracle. Four days before the start of New York City's new fiscal year, his goal in handling its overwhelming fiscal problems has boiled down to a single word: survival.
 So grim are the Mayor's prospects that he would count as a victory the adoption of a budget whose painful service cuts he called unbearable just a month ago. Instead, he is struggling desperately to stave off deeper cuts proposed by the City Council to hold down property taxes. And in the best case he would lose something. 
 Mr. Dinkins originally proposed cuts in an array of city services, including many dear to him, to prompt concessions by municipal unions, aid from the state and taxes from the Council. But one by one those parties rejected him, and yesterday the last of them, the Council, said it would simply pass its own version of the budget over his objections.
The Mayor says the Council's plan would not produce the revenues it claims and would leave the budget out of balance, forcing him to impound funds and make still deeper cuts. But since Mr. Dinkins wants to avoid cuts, the Council's gambit leaves him little choice -- if he hopes to preserve his priorities -- but to force concessions from the municipal unions that were the bulwark of his electoral victory.
Dogged optimism has been the hallmark of Mr. Dinkins's political life, and he said yesterday that he still believed the unions, to whom he recently gave raises, would help. But in explaining why he could only take two questions on a radio call-in show yesterday afternoon, he also showed his worry as he groped his way into an unintentionally unflattering metaphor.
"I can't very well solve the problems of the city if I'm sitting here chatting on the radio while Rome is burning," he said in the broadcast on WBAI-FM.
On the same program, Mr. Dinkins may have given an even better indication of what the fiscal problems have meant for his ambitions for governing. "What we've got to do is sort of tread water," he said.
With his prerogatives chipped away by his own missteps and an economy that has tripped him at every turn, Mr. Dinkins has steadily lowered his sights. However the budget winds up being adopted, and with whatever cuts, the best he could hope for might be greater scrutiny of his management by state and city officials, in exchange for a package of emergency financing to soften the pain and longer term changes in the size of government.
Whether that would take the form of formal controls on the city's spending by the state's Financial Control Board, headed by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, or some kind of more informal kibitzing and bargaining, is unclear. The Control Board could assume binding powers if the city failed to balance the budget, and there is always the risk that a dispute between Mr. Dinkins and the Council over the validity of the budget would invite the board to referree.
Mr. Dinkins recalled with anger this week that only the threat of immediate bankruptcy finally impelled cooperation by unions, the business community and politicians, in the fiscal crisis of 1975. Asked what could prompt agreement this time, he said: "Concern for our city and the welfare of its residents, and the knowledge that tremendous reductions of services will impact on everyone. There is no one that will escape, because it will cost in one way or another everyone of us."
But in the city's lurching course to its current crisis, no sword as sharp as impending default has emerged, and the city has maintained steady access to the credit markets that are its lifeblood, though paying ever higher interest rates. The Mayor has been reduced to fighting a series of holding actions, with plenty of criticism from the sidelines, but little tangible help.
This week, he mounted an aggressive battle to prod the Council to pass $776 million in higher property taxes, led by the architect of his mayoral victory, Deputy Mayor Bill Lynch. Mr. Lynch has been riling up community groups that a week ago were attacking the Mayor for his cuts -- hoping to turn their more strident attacks against the Council's cuts instead.
It is a sign of the perpetual disarray and disagreements among the Mayor's top aides that only in this darkest hour has Mr. Lynch -- nominally in charge of relations with the Council -- taken an active role in negotiating with its leaders. And he has done so in the wake of a bruising fight over drawing new districts to expand the Council to 51 seats, in which he spoke openly of trying to elect insurgents congenial to the Mayor and hostile to the Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone of Queens.
That is important to Mr. Lynch and much of the rest of the coalition of minorities and liberals that elected Mr. Dinkins, as a way of institutionalizing the legacy of the city's first black Mayor, whatever his individual fate.
Senior mayoral advisers say it is now up to their friends in labor, who can play a role in Council elections as well, to put pressure on them to raise taxes, to match the pressure and thousands of postcards members have received in an anti-tax campaign by the real-estate industry. "It's going to be a real test of their political strength," one aide said.
But Mr. Vallone has taken understandable umbrage at this approach. And it has made the Mayor's task in negotiating all the more difficult, since he has chosen not to try to co-opt the Council, but to beat it. And under the revised City Charter that abolished the Board of Estimate and greatly enhanced the Council's powers, that would be a challenge for a mayor at the height of popularity and power, which Mr. Dinkins is not.
 
'Of No Consequence to Me'
 Moreover, some Council members say the Mayor has had trouble making the case that its cuts would really be so much worse than the ones he had already proposed himself. They also said that the administration's lobbying tools had not been precisely matched to their targets and that Mr. Vallone has managed to control his members.
"Sending 1199 is of no consequence to me," said Councilman Walter L. McCaffrey of Queens, referring to the health care and hospital workers union that backed Mr. Dinkins. "If they sent the Electrical Workers union, that might be another thing."
Nor does Mr. Dinkins's style of lordly dignity always work to his advantage. Yesterday, he cut short without explanation a news conference he had called to respond to Mr. Vallone's latest barrage. His aides said later that he was late and rushing to a barbecue at Gracie Mansion honoring the planners of the ticker-tape parade for veterans of the Persian Gulf war.
Some mayoral advisers say that Mr. Dinkins clings to such ceremonial events -- which have larded his schedule in recent days -- as islands of reassuring calm amid his troubles, and as a reminder that he is still Mayor, with all the powers and perquisites that office commands.
In his duel with the Council, Mr. Dinkins has the power only to veto spending it adds, not to restore spending it cuts. That makes his biggest power the one he has always hesitated most to use: The power to say no.

HEADLINE: VIETNAM APPEALS FOR FOREIGN HELP

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HANOI, Vietnam, June 27

 BODY:
Vietnam's ruling Communist Party announced today that it had elected a new leader, Do Muoi, a 74-year-old party loyalist who used his first news conference to plead for international help to end Vietnam's long years as a "poor and backward nation."
Mr. Do Muoi's remarkably blunt request for aid for his tattered nation came as the party replaced more than half of its policy-making group, the Politburo. The new, younger members, while no less committed to the party's absolute power, appeared to be more likely to support moves toward a free market in Vietnam. 
 Western diplomats said the selection of Mr. Do Muoi as the party's General Secretary probably meant that Vietnam would continue or step up its efforts to expand economic and diplomatic relations with former enemies in the developed world, especially with the United States, which has refused to lift a 16-year trade embargo on Hanoi.
Mr. Do Muoi, replaces Nguyen Van Linh, 76, who told colleagues during the Communist Party Congress in Hanoi this week that he was stepping down as General Secretary because of age and poor health.
 
Praise for Retiring Leader
 Mr. Linh was hailed at the party congress for his role as architect of a series of market-oriented reforms -- known as renovation -- that ended decades of economic planning in Vietnam.
Despite the praise for Mr. Linh, not all of his close associates survived today's party leadership changes.
Among those removed from the Politburo was Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach, a Linh ally who had been criticized in the party for pushing too hard for political changes like those that have convulsed the Soviet Union. A new Foreign Minister has not been named. Another one of those dropped from the Politburo was Interior Minister Mai Chi Tho, one of the nation's most powerful men.
Mr. Do Muoi, who was Prime Minister under Mr. Linh and who has adopted Mr. Linh's pro-market economic views, vowed today that economic liberalization would remain the party's "keynote" concern, even as the party continued to retain total control of political life in Vietnam.
 
'The Only Correct Path'
 "Our party and our people are unshakably determined to follow the path of socialism, the path chosen by President Ho Chi Minh, our party and people, the only correct path," he said in a closing speech to the four-day congress.
At a later news conference with Vietnamese and foreign reporters, Mr. Do Muoi, without prompting from the press corps, described Vietnam as a "poor and backward nation -- there's no need to explain it."
He said his Government would seek to expand ties with other nations to help Vietnam "escape" from years of economic stagnation. For the same reason, he said, the nation would avoid foreign military adventures.
Although he did not say so explicitly, Mr. Do Muoi appeared to suggest that Vietnam would not repeat anything like its 1979 invasion of neighboring Cambodia, in which the Vietnamese-backed Government of Premier Hun Sen was installed.
 
U.S. Terms for Better Ties
 The United States has said that it will not improve relations with Vietnam until Hanoi presses Mr. Hun Sen to sign a United Nations peace plan that calls for free elections in Cambodia and a role for rebel groups that are trying to topple the government. The American embargo has deprived Vietnam of badly needed help from the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and private investors.
In many ways, Mr. Do Muoi's remarks today amounted to an admission that Vietnam's revolution has failed to provide the country's 66 million people with anything like a reasonable standard of living.
Despite the advances under the renovation policies, Vietnam remains one of the poorest nations in Asia, with an annual per capita income estimated last year at less than $500.
According to an official biography released today, Mr. Do Muoi was born on Feb. 2, 1917, to a peasant family in Hanoi. While working as a house painter in 1936, he joined the budding Vietnamese nationalist movement and three years later was admitted to the Communist Party of Indo-China.
In 1941, he was arrested by the French colonial government in Vietnam and sentenced to 10 years in prison. He escaped in March 1945 and, according to the biography, rejoined the party and pursued the struggle for Vietnamese independence.
 
Named to Politburo in 1982
 After the war, Mr. Do Muoi held a series of posts in the Communist Party. He was elected to the Politburo in 1982 and named Prime Minister in 1988.
As General Secretary, Mr. Do Muoi will lead a 13-member Politburo. Of the other members, eight will be new to the panel. With their addition, the average age for a Politburo member fell from 71 to close to 60.
"Have no doubt that the new members are absolutely committed to having the Communist Party remain in power," said an Asian diplomat, speaking on condition that he not be named. "I think you will find, however, that these are younger men who are better schooled in modern economic theory, and that will be a great help as Vietnam tries to dig itself out of this economic mess."

HEADLINE: America West Airlines Files For Chapter 11 Bankruptcy

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: PHOENIX, June 27

 BODY:
America West Airlines Inc. filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from its creditors today, joining three other airlines that have fallen on hard times since the Persian Gulf war.
The filing in Federal Bankruptcy Court followed months of extreme financial difficulty for the debt-ridden, expansion-minded carrier. 
 America West said that it would continue operating as usual and that the filing would have no immediate impact on passengers or employees.
"We have explored many alternatives in the last few months to arrange financing to see us through the most difficult time in the airline industry's history," Edward R. Beauvais, the company's chairman, said in a statement. "Unfortunately these endeavors have not been successful thus far."
America West serves 54 cities with 735 flights and employs 15,000 people, including approximately 9,000 in the Phoenix area. Its service area is mainly in the West and Midwest but includes destinations in the Northeast, Canada, Hawaii and Japan.
The company said it would go forward with plans to start service to St. Louis and Atlanta, but on Sept. 7 will drop service to La Guardia Airport in New York; the Grand Canyon; Edmonton, Alberta, and three California airports: Bakersfield, Palmdale and Santa Barbara.
The eight-year-old carrier joins Continental Airlines Holdings, Pan Am and Midway Airlines in bankruptcy court. All four, stung by higher fuel prices and fewer passengers during the gulf war and the recession, are seeking to reorganize their businesses while the court protects them from creditors.
The statement did not provide details about the filing, and a spokesman for the airline, Dick Shimizu, said he could not elaborate.
On June 17, America West announced it would skip a $6 million interest payment due on $100 million in corporate bonds. That news followed the company's June 6 announcement that it was suspending aircraft lease payments. America West leases 80 of its 115 airplanes, mostly Boeing jets.
America West reported losses of $50 million in 1991's first quarter and $75 million for 1990.
Ansett Airlines, based in Australia, owns 20 percent of America West.

HEADLINE: Bank Vault Keeper Held in $16.3 Million Theft

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON

 BODY:
The infamous bank robber Willie Sutton supposedly said he robbed banks because "that's where the money is." John DiGiovanni knew where the vault was. He was its manager.
Law-enforcement officials say that Mr. DiGiovanni, 31 years old, stole $16.3 million in Treasury bonds while he was in charge of the underground vault at the Bank of New York branch at One Wall Street. He handed them over to a friend who needed to settle some gambling debts, the officials said. 
 The friend, identified as John Gentile, a 22-year-old unemployed construction worker, was said to have ordered 11 other defendants to find ways to sell the bonds, which had face values of between $100,000 and $1 million.
Mr. DiGiovanni and the other suspects were charged in Federal District Court in Manhattan yesterday with conspiracy to steal and sell 28 bonds that disappeared from the vault between December and April. Prosecutors said all but one bond -- a $1 million note -- had been recovered.
The bank lost no money because it placed stop orders on the securities, making them non-negotiable, law-enforcement officials said. They said Mr. DiGiovanni, of Brooklyn, had been dismissed from his job at the bank.
Court papers contend that Mr. Gentile divided the stolen bonds among four of the other defendants: Anthony Dagnone, 54, of Mahopac, N.Y.; Frank Bitetto, 62, of Staten Island; Frank Satturo, 44, of Brooklyn, and Frank Tufariello, 47, of Manhattan. The prosecution says they tried four scams to unload the stolen bonds, including transferring them to people or institutions in New York, New Jersey and Florida.
The prosecution says that Mr. Satturo told an employee of Oppenheimer & Company that he had inherited two $1 million Treasury bonds and wanted to sell them to make other investments.
Law-enforcement officials said that Oppenheimer agreed to buy one of the bonds for $264,688, but filed proof-of-ownership documents that turned out to be fraudulent. The Government is not accusing Oppenheimer of acting improperly, law-enforcement officials said, noting that Mr. Satturo tried to sell Oppenheimer several other bonds and that it turned him down.
The other defendants were accused of sending or receiving the stolen securities. They are Gregory Segnit, 41, of Buchanan, N.Y.; Arnold DiGregoria, 44, of Brookfield, Conn.; Joseph Lipson, 47, of Madison, N.J.; Robert Destasio, 34, and Joseph Conetta, 45, both of Brooklyn, and Frank Rossano, 42, and Joseph Palma, 35, both of Staten Island. If convicted, the defendants face a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.

HEADLINE: Anxious Town Might Say Yes to a Nuclear Waste Dump

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WEST VALLEY, N.Y., June 27

 BODY:
The offer to any rural community in upstate New York: $4.2 million in benefits that would include a new town park, trust funds for the library and the Fire Department, road improvements and a scholarship fund for local youths headed to college.
The catch: the town has to agree to be the home to a dump for low-level radioactive waste. 
 West Valley is interested.
Members of the Town Board of Ashford, which surrounds this village 35 miles south of Buffalo, had been on the verge of making the decision themselves on whether to accept the package, which was negotiated by the president of the local Chamber of Commerce and a consortium of waste generators.
But at a raucous meeting at a sweltering Town Hall here Wednesday night, the five board members decided instead to put the matter to an advisory vote before the whole town of 2,100 people on July 9. The board members said they were reluctant to make the decision themselves because they had received hundreds of letters in recent weeks indicating an equal division of opinion about the package -- one of a variety of offers being made around the country as states search for waste sites. "Regardless of the vote now, you've got friend against friend, neighbor against neighbor, and it's all for the sake of a few dollars," said Robert J. Lukowski, a dump opponent who says that the bright blue "Just Say No" placard in his front yard was burned by a vandal Saturday night.
 
It's Not Fisher-Price
 Directly across the street from Mr. Lukowski, Kelly Wheeler set up her own little sign. "Say Yes to Progress," it reads.
"Sure, it would be a lot better if Fisher-Price wanted to come in here," said Mrs. Wheeler, a dairy farmer. "But that's not happening. The bottom line is, it's a business and it's going to create an economy in this town."
That anybody in West Valley is interested might be a surprise to the commission that had been searching for a place to put the waste -- a search that has taken creative twists elsewhere in the nation. Its members have been run off some potential sites and burned in effigy elsewhere.
Paradoxically, West Valley is one of several places in the state that is now prohibited from taking nuclear waste. It is already the site of an inactive high-level radioactive dump that the Federal Government is spending $1.2 billion to clean up, and of an inactive low-level dump that had to be stabilized in the early 1980's after radioactive leachate was discovered on the site.
But legislation has already been offered in Albany that would allow the state to build a new dump on the 3,300-acre site. Several lawmakers from the Buffalo area and elsewhere said they would support it if the townspeople here said they were willing to take the waste.
Among supporters of the package, there has been an apparent debate over the effects of putting off a vote. Some said it could allow the town to negotiate an even better deal, but others worried that some other community would be enticed to negotiate a package of its own.
While the problems this town has experienced with nuclear wastes have clearly inflamed the fears of those who do not want the dump, many others feel that the operators of the new waste site will have learned from past mistakes and that, in any event, there is so much nuclear material at West Valley now that taking some more might not be so objectionable.
 
Until the Right Site Comes Along
 "This low-level stuff shouldn't bother us a bit, because we have a lot hotter stuff in there already," said Maurice Gentner, the town fire chief. As he talked, he was fixing a broken radiator hose on a 24-year-old pumper truck that, he noted somewhat longingly, could be replaced if the benefits package were approved.
New York is one of a small but growing number of states that are offering inducements to communities to accept low-level waste, said Edward L. Helminski, publisher of The Radioactive Exchange, a newsletter that tracks the efforts.
He said towns in Colorado and South Dakota had passed resolutions saying they would be willing to take the waste if they were paid eough money, but neither town had the appropriate geologic criteria for a site and the plans were dropped.
In Maine, officials there said, at least nine private landowners have offered their property for sale to the state commission looking for a site, but all have done so in the face of bitter community opposition.
In Illinois, the State Legislature specifically required that the community be willing. The state spent several million dollars advertising the benefits and taking other steps such as arranging trips to France to inspect nuclear waste sites for members of interested communities.
Every state is under a Federal mandate to find a place to store its own waste because the only existing disposal sites, in South Carolina, Nevada and Washington, plan to close their borders to out-of-state waste.
 
80,000 Cubic Feet of Waste
 Earlier this month, Connecticut identified three potential sites for storing its waste, all in the north-central part of the state. New Jersey plans to identify possible locations later this year.
Low-level waste consists of materials used in connection with radioactive isotopes and nuclear power -- things like tools, workers' clothes, resins and products used in hospital radiology departments -- but not the high-level rods from nuclear reactors.
While much of the material decays within a few months, some will remain radioactive for hundreds of years. New York State generates about 80,000 cubic feet of waste a year, enough to fill an Olympic-sized swimming pool.
New York officials first identified five possible sites in Allegany and Cortland Counties in 1989, but eventually the state suspended research work there because scores of protesters interfered with it. The state has now developed plans for interim storage sites in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn and in Peekskill in Westchester County, choices expected to generate more protests.
West Valley officials got the idea for storing the waste here last year after word surfaced that those who generate the waste would be willing to pay for the benefits package. On top of the $4.2 million in benefits, the town would receive $1.5 million annually in new taxes and fees, roughly doubling its present tax revenues.
Roberta Lovenheim, executive director of the New York State Low-Level Waste Group, which represents utilities, hospitals and other users and generators of nuclear materials, said that storage would pose no health risks.
She also said that the material that would come to West Valley would add just a fraction of radioactivity to what is already stored there: about 100,000 curies added annually to an existing total at the West Valley site of 30 million curies of high-level waste and 400,000 of low-level waste. A curie is the unit used for measuring radioactivity.
But such assurances have failed to reassure many people in the community.
The town meeting here was a dramatic affair, with one protester dressed up as Gov. Mario M. Cuomo throwing fake $100 bills in the air as he circulated through the crowd and several others dressed up as yellow radioactive waste storage drums.
"This package is a bribe, plain and simple," said Beverly Zimmerman Spross, a town resident who was wearing a black button that read, "Plutonium Is Forever." She said that the community is poor -- the per capita income here in Cattaraugus County ranks 58th of New York's 62 counties -- and that the waste generators believed they could foist the waste on "gullible and naive" citizens.
But despite the protesters, some of whom sang "America the Beautiful" as the Town Board deliberated, many citizens turned out to support the package.
And despite objections from one board member, Roy D. Engels, who described it as "the chicken way out," the board wound up voting 4 to 1 to put the whole issue to a townwide vote.
The Town Supervisor, William T. King, declined to say how he would have voted had the board been forced to decide the issue Wednesday night. "I really can't tell you," he said with a rueful smile. "I think I would have asked a little prayer for the answer to come down to my ears."

HEADLINE: Control Borrowing, Contain Pain

 BODY:
Borrowing is a dirty word in New York City, and no wonder. It evokes the not-so-distant 1960's and 70's, when City Hall thought it could solve every problem by spending borrowed billions -- and brought the city to the edge of ruin. Even so, as the city faces its new fiscal crisis, people are daring again to use the dirty word.
The economy is so troubled, the huge budget cuts so onerous that under strict conditions, borrowing could help provide a humane and efficient alternative. But it's too soon. It is premature to consider deficit financing, at least until the city meets its Monday deadline to adopt a balanced 1992 budget that contains no borrowing. 
 That will require concessions of at least $300 million from the city unions, and cooperation from obstructive politicians. City Council Speaker Peter Vallone would force even crueler cuts to avoid higher property taxes and restore some cuts he dislikes in Mayor David Dinkins's budget; the Senate majority leader, Ralph Marino, is withholding support for the Mayor's tax package to extract more school aid from Gov. Mario Cuomo.
The Monday deadline is real, and must be met if the city is to maintain its standing in the credit markets. Then Mr. Dinkins and Mr. Cuomo can look to the future and ways of turning short-term pain into long-term recovery.
 Borrowing cannot be responsibly considered unless it is tied to a strict, multi-year plan of budget cuts, tax restructuring, streamlining, productivity savings and structural changes in government. Otherwise the borrowed money provides a lazy way to avoid discipline, an excuse to maintain wasteful rules and an inefficient, inflated work force. Only if borrowing is contingent on a long-term plan that locks in reforms with legislation, legally binding promises to bondholders, or both, can the public be reassured that the city will not revert to the path of least resistance.
Many practices have to change. There is, for instance, no justification for maintaining a work force that grew by more than 50,000 in 10 years. Why should sanitation crews continue to be paid for eight hours while working three? Where is the logic in allowing three agencies to deliver emergency medical services? There's every reason to privatize some services, to shift Medicaid and welfare payments to the state, to revise civil service laws to make the work force more competitive.
These and other reforms belong in any deficit financing plan, just as Felix Rohatyn, chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, said when he first raised the idea months ago.
It was quickly rejected then. Indeed, deficit financing is still a sensitive subject because laws passed during the last fiscal crisis prevent the city from going into debt. If it does, the Financial Control Board's advisory powers over the city budget would become binding.
Mayor Dinkins thinks the return of the Control Board would harm the city's reputation and usurp his authority. But the Mayor could take the initiative by presenting his own comprehensive plan and calling on the board to institute it. If he remains opposed to using the board, other forms of oversight might be devised.
New Yorkers are just now coming to understand the harsh depth of the new budget cuts. At least 10,000 people will lose their jobs -- many more if Mr. Marino and Mr. Vallone don't come around. Hundreds of thousands will lose important services. The choices are so onerous, so likely to fray the social fabric, that prudent citizens have to consider borrowing. But only as one carefully controlled part of a unified program.

Tiered Accounts

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:

The continued decline in bank savings rates has led more and more banks to offer tiered money market accounts. They pay a higher rate of return, but a larger deposit is needed. Depositors who have the right amount of cash can earn more than 2 percent more than the bottom tier. Here's how much can be earned in interest annually on minimum deposits in tiered money market accounts at two typical banks.

	 	 	 		1st Tier	2d Tier	3d Tier	Bank A	$500	$10,000	$25,000		5%	5.6%	6.15%	 	 	 	 	Bank B	$2,500	$20,000	50,000		5.25%	6.05%	6.75%

HEADLINE: Rev. Lord MacLeod, 96, Founder Of Church Community in Scotland

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: LONDON, June 28

 BODY:
The Rev. Lord MacLeod of Fuinary, who founded an ecumenical religious community on the Scottish island of Iona, died on Thursday at his home in Edinburgh. He was 96 years old.
The cause of death was not announced, but his son, Maxwell, said he had been ill for some time. 
 George F. MacLeod, a minister in the Presbyterian Church of Scotland, left his ministry in the Govan shipyard district of Glasgow in 1938, during the Depression.
With a dozen unemployed craftsmen and members of the clergy, he set off for Iona -- a bare, wind-swept island, three miles long and a mile and a half wide -- where the Irish missionary St. Columba landed with 12 companions in A.D. 563. It became the base for St. Columba's ministry to Scotland and Iceland.
The minister and his followers restored the ruins of the 13th-century Benedictine abbey, putting into practice his ideas for people of contrasting backgrounds to live and work together for at least part of every year.
The island, off Mull on the Scottish west coast, has a population of only 103, but last year 200,000 visitors went to see the restored monastic buildings.
The community has 204 members worldwide, half clergy and half laity, and 900 associates who make donations on St. Columba's Day, June 9.
Members try to live by a fivefold rule: prayer and Bible study, sharing money, sharing use of time, meeting with fellow members and peace and justice commitments.
In 1989 Lord MacLeod was given the Templeton Prize, the major award in the field of religion, for adapting "the monastic ideal and spirit to modern life and religious activity."
He was a captain in the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders in World War I and was decorated for bravery with the Military Cross and the French Croix de Guerre. By the time of World War II, he had become a pacifist and Socialist and later was vice president of the Scottish Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament.
He led the Iona Community until 1967. He was the first holder of the Fosdick professorship of the Rockefeller Foundation at Union Theological Seminary in New York.
His wife, Lorna, died in 1984. He is survived by their children, Mary, Maxwell and Neil.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Mostly Up, but Mark Is at Center of Day's Activity

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar settled mostly higher on world currency markets yesterday, but most of the day's activity centered on the German mark.
Gold prices advanced worldwide. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery settled at $368.10 an ounce, up $2.10 from Thursday. The Republic National Bank said gold rose $2.20 an ounce to a late bid of $368. 
 Investors began selling marks on concerns that Germany was planning to reinstitute a withholding tax on interest income. Germany's Finance Minister, Theo Waigel, said the tax would not be introduced anytime soon, but that failed to stem a mark-selling spree.
"Worldwide investors got a whiff" of that tax and decided to cut back their holdings in the German bond and stock markets, said Andrew Busch, a trader at the Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago.
Frankfurt's DAX stock market index shed nearly 44 points, to close at 1,622.18.
"The mark has been under pressure all day," said John McCarthy, chief dealer at the Algemene Bank Nederland.
In New York, the dollar jumped to 1.8115 marks, from 1.7950 marks on Thursday. Still, the currency's advance was not considered that sigificant, Mr. McCarthy said.
Traders said nervousness over what impact the political unrest in Yugoslavia might have on the German economy also stimulated a flight from marks. The dollar benefited from the Yugoslavia situation, since the dollar is perceived as a safe haven in times of world turmoil.
The activity in the mark overshadowed a Commerce Department report showing the index of leading indicators rising eight-tenths of 1 percent in May, its fourth consecutive advance.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 138.15 yen, down 0.50 yen. Later, in London, the dollar was quoted at 137.85 yen. In New York the dollar settled at 137.53 yen, down from 137.80 Thursday.
In London, the British pound fell to $1.6185 from $1.6325 late Thursday. In New York, it cost $1.6218 to buy a pound, less than the $1.6325 of late Thursday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Thursday's rates included: 1.5525 Swiss francs, up from 1.5503; 6.1380 French francs, up from 6.0890; 1,346.25 Italian lire, up from 1,336.50, and 1.1418 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1428.
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday's rates included: 1.5580 Swiss francs, up from 1.5485; 6.1470 French francs, up from 6.0825; 2.0425 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0195; 1,348.00 Italian lire, up from 1,335.75; 1.1423 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1436.
Gold rose in London to a late bid of $369.25 an ounce, from $365.25 late Thursday. In Zurich, gold rose to $368.40, from $365. Gold in Hong Kong was up $1.63, to $367.45.
Silver prices rose. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, silver for current delivery settled at $4.424 an ounce, up from $4.385 on Thursday. In London silver rose to a late bid of $4.46, from $4.37.

HEADLINE: Thatcher Will Leave the Commons But Plans to Keep Speaking Out

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, June 28

 BODY:
After 31 years in elected office, Margaret Thatcher, who resigned as Prime Minister in November, said today that she would not run for her seat in the House of Commons in the next election, which must be held within a year.
But Mrs. Thatcher, who is 65 years old, immediately squelched any idea that she intended to assume a low profile. 
 Mrs. Thatcher, who was forced from 10 Downing Street after 11 years by a rebellion in her Conservative Party, said she thought that she would be able to speak out more forcibly on subjects like the political and economic integration of Europe if she was not a Member of Parliament, where she has represented Finchley, a middle-class section of London. She would then not have to worry so much about undercutting Prime Minister John Major, who was her favorite to succeed her.
 Leaving Commons, she said, will "make it easier for me to say exactly what I think."
Since she left office, politicians and the press have dissected her every comment, looking for dissatisfaction with Mr. Major. In a departure from Mrs. Thatcher, he has tried to seem constructive on the issue of European integration and has nurtured a caring image to woo voters who had become disenchanted with the strong but often seemingly insensitive Mrs. Thatcher.
 
'A Strong Ally' of Major

"It is my purpose to continue to be a strong ally and friend of Prime Minister John Major and the Government he leads," Mrs. Thatcher said today.
Mrs. Thatcher, a grocer's daughter, said she would like a seat in the unelected House of Lords so she could have a forum. A peerage, which is bestowed by the Queen, is virtually automatic for a former Prime Minister. She also plans to write, and recently hired Marvin Josephson of International Creative Management Inc., to find a publisher for her memoirs. She said she also intended "to play an active part" in the next election campaign.
Mrs. Thatcher recently stepped back into the limelight here by renewing her campaign against turning the 12-nation European Community into a United States of Europe with a strong central government. The French, Germans and Italians are leading a movement to do that. Mrs. Thatcher has long feared that a federal Europe would lead to the reimposition of socialism on Britain. As Prime Minister, she sold off many state-owned enterprises, weakened the unions and slashed taxes -- policies aimed at encouraging competition.
 
Speeches of Warning

Ending seven months of relative silence, she made impassioned speeches in the United States and Britain in the last two weeks on the dangers of a federal Europe. They inflamed the debate between federalists and anti-federalists in the Conservative Party. She warned that a federal Europe could become a protectionist bloc that could slow the reconstruction of Eastern Europe, set off global trade wars, undermine the NATO military alliance and endanger world peace.
Mrs. Thatcher's stand on European integration and her introduction of an unpopular household tax led Michael Heseltine, a former member of her Cabinet and now Environment Secretary, to challenge her leadership. She resigned after the first ballot in which she won a majority of the votes cast by the Conservative Members of Parliament but failed to secure a big enough margin to prevent a second round.
Mr. Major is replacing the tax and says he would accept greater European integration if it evolved slowly. He hopes these policies will unify his party for the next election. The Labor Party now leads the Conservatives by 8 to 10 percentage points in opinion polls.

HEADLINE: Indicators Index Posts a 4th Gain

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 28

 BODY:
The Government index designed to forecast the direction of the economy rose eight-tenths of 1 percent in May, the fourth straight monthly advance after six straight declines, the Commerce Department reported today.
The increase solidified expectations of a rebounding economy during the second half of the year. But most economists still say they believe the recovery will be relatively weak, and some analysts, in fact, contend it will be short-lived. 
 Nonetheless, the May rise in the index of leading indicators displayed remarkable breadth, with 8 of the 11 components moving higher.
"This makes us feel comfortable," said Maria Ramirez, head of a New York consulting firm bearing her name. "All the numbers point to a second-quarter bottoming out."
 
 Growth of 3.9% Predicted
 A separate gauge, the experimental index of leading indicators compiled by the National Bureau of Economic Research, predicted today that the economy would expand at an annual rate of 3.9 percent over the next six months. The bureau, a private group that has become the nation's official designator of expansions and contractions, also figured that there was only a 1 percent chance that the economy would still be in recession in November.
The Government's index, though failing to warn of recession last summer, is still widely watched, and few were inclined today to dismiss the implication of a fourth straight advance after negative readings from August through January.
Analysts also noted that the Commerce Department's index of coincident indicators, those that move at the same time as the economy, rose for the first time since last June.
 
 Big Plus Factor: Jobless Claims
 The biggest positive contributor was a drop in the number of initial claims for state unemployment insurance. The others were a rise in the number of building permits, higher new orders for factory-made consumer goods, more contracts and orders for plant and equipment, a lengthening of the average workweek, a rise in the price of materials particularly sensitive to the business cycle, slower deliveries to companies by their suppliers and an expanded money supply.
The three components holding the index back were lowered consumer expectations, a decline in factory backlogs and falling stock prices.
Upon recalculation, the index's advance for April was trimmed to four-tenths of 1 percent, from six-tenths, mainly reflecting new data on factory orders for consumer goods. This correction, however, was offset by an upward revision that raised the March gain to nine-tenths of 1 percent, from seven-tenths.
The department's index of lagging indicators tumbled nine-tenths of 1 percent in May, its fourth straight decline. This drop helped produce a second consecutive increase in the ratio of the coincident index to the lagging index, a ratio considered an alternate forecaster.
 
 Other Indications of a Rebound

Other private-sector indexes also pointed to an economic rebound. The composite forecasting index assembled by Safian Investment Research in White Plains rose 1.23 percent in May, to its highest level since October, as 16 components rose, 6 fell and 1 was unchanged.
With financial components eliminated, the Safian index in April and May posted the sharpest back-to-back increases since late 1983.
The leading index of business activity in the service sector, compiled by the Columbia Business School's Center for International Business Cycle Research, posted an annualized growth rate of 3.4 percent in May, compared with a revised 1.9 percent rate in April.
"Service-sector activity has bottomed out and is now poised for healthy growth," said Geoffrey H. Moore, the center's director.

HEADLINE: House Panel Approves Sweeping New Bank Rules

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 28

 BODY:
The House Banking Committee voted today to sweep away more than six decades of laws, dating to the Depression, that have prevented banks from expanding into new businesses and across state lines.
The legislation now heads to an uncertain fate before the Energy and Commerce Committee before moving on to the floor of the House of Representatives. The bill is intended to address the growing problems of the banking industry, which although largely profitable is confronting its greatest crisis since the 1930's. Members of the Banking Committee are far more sympathetic to the banks than the House as a whole. 
 The industry's problems are rooted in a pattern of lending without restraint in highly speculative ventures that many critics identify with the financial excesses of the 1980's.
 
'The Morning After'
 "What we did today is the morning after the night before," said Representative Henry B. Gonzalez, the Texas Democrat who is chairman of the committee.
The Bush Administration's prescription for the industry's ills, which was largely embraced by the committee today, is to clear the banking landscape of barriers to the ownership of banks by industrial companies and to the mergers of investment banks and commercial banks. The restrictions were enacted after the banking industry collapsed in the 1930's.
The package would also eliminate state barriers that have made it difficult and costly for banks to open new branches, and acquire other banks, in other states.
"We must revitalize our outdated banking system," Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said after the committee voted. "Our goal should be to draw private-sector capital back into the system and not risk the chance of calling on the taxpayer."
The 31-to-20 vote was a significant, though not complete, victory for the Administration. The committee followed the recommendations of Mr. Brady on interstate banking, industrial ownership of banks and the expansion of banks into businesses like securities and insurance.
But the committee also rejected two cornerstones of the Administration's package. They would have imposed modest restrictions on the coverage of bank deposit insurance and significantly changed the way Washington now regulates the industry through four different agencies.
The decision not to change the coverage of deposit insurance, in particular, drew criticism from both the committee chairman and the ranking Republican, and some committee members predicted that some restrictions would be imposed on the House floor.
"Though the bill has many positive aspects, by placing no limits on deposit insurance or on activities banks can engage in, it makes an S.& L.-type crisis more likely in the next decade," said Representative Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of Brooklyn, who said he voted for the measure simply to get the issue before the full House.
"The familiarity is chilling," he added. "We are poised on the brink of repeating a mistake that never should have been made in the first place."
The fund that protects deposits is at its lowest level since it was created in 1934, largely because of the unprecedented number of bank failures -- more than 1,000 in the last five years. L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, said this week that the fund would be insolvent next year and could face an $11 billion deficit.
Like most of the votes on the legislation, the final vote sending the measure to the floor did not follow any discernible political pattern. Rather, it reflected more complicated preferences on consumer interests, big banks, small banks and other industries.
Nineteen Democrats and 12 Republicans voted in support of the measure, which drew opposition from 12 Democrats, 7 Republicans and the only independent in the House, Bernard Sanders of Vermont.
Despite a nearly universal aversion on Capitol Hill to going before the voters with another bailout on the Congressional records, committee members today took the first step toward a taxpayer rescue of the banks, by voting to allow the deposit insurance fund to increase its borrowing line with the Treasury to $30 billion, from $5 billion. The insolvency of the savings and loan insurance fund led to the establishment of the Resolution Trust Corporation in 1989. The savings and loan bailout could cost $500 billion over 40 years.
Mr. Brady insists that the loans to the bank insurance fund will be repaid by the banks. But the banks are already complaining about a large increase in their premiums that will take effect on Monday. The increase will raise bank contributions to the fund to 23 cents for each $100 in deposits, from 19.5 cents.
The House is not expected to consider the bank legislation until September, about the same time it will be deliberating on an Adminstration request for an additional $80 billion to continue the savings and loan bailout.
Administration officials are privately concerned that the timing could put the banking package in jeopardy, particularly because of the portion that would give banks new authority to expand into securities and insurance. Lawmakers are expected to argue that it is dangerous to encourage banks to look for new capital in two industries suffering their most difficult period in years.
But before it reaches the floor, the measure faces a difficult road in the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The committee's chairman, Representative John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan, has already challenged many of its most significant elements.
The Senate has not indicated when it will consider banking legislation. Senator Donald W. Riegle Jr., the Michigan Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, has not scheduled a time to draft legislation. He has indicated that it will be done this summer.

HEADLINE: Prices of Long-Term Treasury Bonds Soar

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
Prices of long-term Treasury securities suddenly soared yesterday after being largely dormant for days. Dealers said the initial demand for Treasury bonds reflected a stronger dollar and weaker stock markets in both Tokyo and Europe earlier in the day.
The demand grew as domestic stock prices began to drop along with commodity prices, a key barometer of inflation, which is the bane of the market in fixed-income securities. 
 "While these factors were enough to ignite the bond market, which opened with the long bond up a quarter of a point, the rally was then carried forward by strong hints that the economic data for June may not be as rosy as May's," said William V. Sullivan Jr., senior vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. "On top of all this was the usual buying for statement purposes on the last day in June."
 
 Rally Fueled by Rumors
 Further fuel was added to the rally by rumors that Olympia & York, a major real estate developer, and the Chase Manhattan Bank were having financial problems. Officials of both companies dismissed the rumors as unfounded.
"The rumors aside," Mr. Sullivan continued, "we saw quite a bit of nervous money move out of equities and into the longer Treasury debt issues, even after the stock market began recovering."
Despite the inevitable profit taking that occurs after a strong rally and before a weekend in summer, the Treasury's benchmark long bonds, the 8 1/8 percent issue maturing in May 2021, were being offered late in the session at 96 27/32, up 27/32, after being as high as 99 31/32 in the morning. The long bond's yield fell to 8.40 percent, from 8.48 percent the day before and 8.50 percent a week ago.
 
 Long Notes at 8.22%
 The long notes, the 8 percent issue maturing in May 2001, climbed 16/32, to 98 13/32, for a yield of 8.22 percent. The new 7 7/8 percent notes of 1996 rose 9/32, to 99 30/32, for a yield of 7.87 percent; the new 7's of 1993 gained 4/32, at 100 5/32, for a yield of 6.90 percent.
Shorter-term Treasuries also benefited from the shift of money out of stocks, Mr. Sullivan noted. Late in the day, the discount rate on the 90-day bills was unchanged, at 5.53 percent, but the six-month yield fell 6 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 5.67 percent, and the outstanding one-year bills lost 6 basis points, at 5.92 percent.
"The Fed tried to make sure that the end of the quarter and first half would not cause credit problems for the banking system by adding $2.5 billion of reserves," Mr. Sullivan added.
But a last-minute credit squeeze among some banks sent the Federal funds rate to 8 percent at the close.

HEADLINE: Stocks Off Sharply; Dow Loses 28.18

BYLINE: By ALISON LEIGH COWAN

 BODY:
Stocks fell sharply yesterday in lethargic trading as investors brushed aside a report by the Government that its index of leading indicators increased in May for the fourth consecutive month.
The Commerce Department report was merely the latest evidence that an economic recovery is under way, and together with yesterday's rally in bond prices, it ordinarily would have augured well for stock prices. 
 Instead, the Dow Jones industrial average, which had tumbled as much as 55 points earlier in the day, closed off 28.18, at 2,906.75.
 
 Nagging Concerns
 Analysts chalked up the market's willfulness to nagging concerns on a slew of issues that suggest that the recovery may not be robust enough to save, let alone lift, corporate profits. In addition, five buying programs and five sell programs lasting a total of 104 minutes accounted for a net drop of 18.12 points, according to Birinyi Associates, which tracks program trading.
"What's troubling is the stock market did not do well in the face of good news, and the question is why," said Hugh A. Johnson, the chief investment officer of the First Albany Corporation. "One big message that the market might have issued today is it may be sure we're going to get a recovery from the economy. That's clear from the leading-indicators index. But the recovery will not be strong enough to give us the earnings that will validate stocks at current levels."
The gloom went well beyond the closely watched Dow, though the blue-chip stocks were generally the hardest hit. The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks fell 3.24 points, to 371.16, while the Nasdaq composite index fell 0.32 points, to 475.92. The American Stock Exchange's market-value index fell 1.31 points to 358.12, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 1.47 points, to finish the week at 203.47. Also on the big board, 901 issues declined and only 677 issues advanced.
 
 Volume Remains Modest

Trading activity on the Big Board was a modest 163.8 million shares, about even with Thursday's 163.1 million.
"The only encouraging feature of the market today is the volume is so very, very low," Mr. Johnson said. "But no matter how you look at it, the failure of the market to respond to seemingly good news is troubling, and I think that will bother people over the weekend when they reflect about it."
One area of persistent concern all week has been bank stocks. Investors became anxious earlier in the week because of an announcement by Wells Fargo that its second-quarter earnings would be weaker than expected, and again yesterday by rumblings of possible financing problems at Chase Manhattan Bank, one of the nation's largest banks. A Chase spokesman told Reuters that the rumors were "totally unfounded." Nonetheless, Chase stock fell 1 1/8, to 16 1/4, down 6.5 percent, and was the second-most-active issue on the Big Board.
 
 Concerns About Banking

"Concerns are resurfacing as people are realizing that the recovery is not bailing out some of the credits in the bank sector," said Charles W. Peabody, a bank analyst at Kidder, Peabody who recently circulated a list of 370 financially troubled banks, the largest of which is Chase. Those banks share some characteristics with banks that have already failed and therefore warrant special caution, he added.
Other companies whose stocks got nicked yesterday because of questions about their future earnings were Monsanto and Winnebago Industries. Monsanto, a chemicals concern, closed down 1/4, at 66, after it announced that it would take a charge of $325 million, or $2.54 a share, and eliminate 2,500 jobs as part of a restructuring. Winnebago, which makes recreational vehicles, fell 1/8, to 4 7/8, after it reported a fiscal third-quarter loss of $2.2 million, or 9 cents a share, because of lower sales.
Among airline stocks, America West Airlines, which filed for bankruptcy late Thursday, fell 3/4, to 2 1/2, in heavy over-the-counter trading.

Monsanto Cutbacks To Cost 2,500 Jobs

 BODY:
The Monsanto Company said yesterday that it would eliminate about 2,500 jobs, close three plants and take a $325 million after-tax restructuring charge in the second quarter to improve efficiency and earnings.
The company, based in St. Louis, said it hoped to achieve most of the job cuts through a voluntary program that includes early retirement or help in finding other jobs, said Scarlett L. Foster, a Monsanto spokeswoman. She said if not enough people agreed to leave voluntarily then the company would begin making layoffs. 
 The restructuring primarily affects the company's largest unit, the Monsanto Chemical Company, which accounts for about 44 percent of Monsanto's sales. The unit will lose about 1,750 jobs, Ms. Foster said.
Monsanto also plans to cut 130 jobs from its American corporate staff and 75 jobs from its international corporate staff, the spokeswoman said. The remaining reductions will come from other parts of the company.
The restructuring does not come for lack of performance from Monsanto Chemical, said A. Nicholas Filippello, the company's chief economist. "The chemical company was able to demonstrate back in the latter part of the 80's that it is capable of reaching very nice returns on capital. They were returning about 20 percent."
To maintain that performance level, he said, "It is necessary to do some trimming."
The three plants to be closed employ a total of 200 people, Ms. Foster said. The plants are in Carson and Long Beach, Calif., and in Everett, Mass.
Production of Monsanto Chemical's detergent ingredients will move from the Carson plant to one in Alvin, Tex., and production of phosphoric acid and salt will move from Long Beach to plants in Missouri, Michigan and Georgia, Ms. Foster said. No decision has been made on the Everett plant, which makes water-treatment chemicals, paper chemicals and other products.
Monsanto deferred a $108 million fourth-quarter charge last year on a restructuring of its agricultural unit, folding the charge into the $325 million one announced yesterday. Revamping the unit affected about 300 employees, most of whom participated in voluntary programs similar to those being offered in the current restructuring, Ms. Foster said.
On the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Monsanto's stock fell 25 cents a share, to close at $66.

HEADLINE: Suffolk Votes a Sales-Tax Rise, to 8%

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HAUPPAUGE, L.I. June 28

 BODY:
Running out of money and fearful that further downgrading of its bonds was imminent, Suffolk County adopted a $152 million financial plan today that includes a request for a half-cent increase in the county sales tax, to 8 percent.
The plan, proposed by County Executive Patrick G. Halpin, also freezes county property taxes through the end of 1994 and requires an outside audit to certify that future county budgets are balanced before they are adopted. The county faces a budget deficit estimated at $150 million through the end of 1992. 
 The plan was approved by the County Legislature at 1 A.M. after an emergency session that lasted 14 hours. The vote was 14 to 4.
Mr. Halpin and other Suffolk officials headed to Albany before midday to ask the State Legislature to authorize the sales-tax increase before the current legislative session adjourns.
 
Halpin Asks Albany Leaders
 The county would keep half of the sales tax revenue, with the rest going to the state.
Edwin L. Crawford, the executive director of the New York State Association of Counties, said that Suffolk is the first county to ask for authority to raise the sales tax in this legislative session, which is expected to end next week.
Steven A. Greenberg, a spokesman for Assembly Speaker Mel Miller, said Mr. Halpin met today with Mr. Miller and Democratic state assemblymen from Long Island to press for the sales-tax authorization. "The Speaker is likely to look favorably on the county's request," Mr. Greenberg said.
Mr. Halpin said the additional half a percent tax would generate $23 million in new revenue this year and $63 million in 1992. He said he abandoned his former position that the increase would be "premature" after the Standard & Poor's Corporation announced on Monday that it was lowering its rating of Suffolk bonds to a speculative category, which would increase the interest rate paid by the county.
"After that it was no longer premature," said Mr. Halpin. "We have a situation where we are completely shut out of the credit markets." Mr. Halpin said that without immediate new revenues the county would run out of money by August. "If we default on our bonds, by definition we are in bankruptcy," Mr. Halpin said. "Then a judge will take over. He will raise property taxes as high as is necessary for us to meet our obligations, and that will cost our taxpayers dearly."
County officials tied to the financial crisis to sagging sales-tax revenues and sharp increases in the county share of costs for programs mandated by the state. Mr. Halpin said mandates increased by $40 million this year.
In addition, the plan asks for a two-week payroll lag for county employees, for a $12 million saving this year. Under the plan, paychecks would be delayed two weeks sometime this year, and employees would recover the money within six years. Mr. Halpin said that if employee unions agreed to the lag, a program to furlough county employees for up to twenty Fridays this year would be canceled. The unions are polling their members on the pay-deferral proposal.
Maury M. Cooper, a senior vice president at Standard & Poor's in Manhattan, said it was encouraging that the county had enacted the plan. But she said the rating agency would await approvals of the sales-tax increase and the payroll change before reconsidering the Suffolk bond rating.
John E. McArdle, a spokesman for the Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino, Republican of Oyster Bay, said Republican state senators from Long Island raised "a number of concerns" during a meeting today with Mr. Halpin, a Democrat. Mr. McArdle said he did not expect any decision on the sales tax issue today, but called the concerns "not insurmountable."

HEADLINE: Reporter's Notebook;
A Renovation Keeps Alive the Flush 80's

BYLINE: By PETER KERR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, June 28

 BODY:
A walk from one end of the State House to the other these days is a bit like a trip from Oz to Kansas.
In a section closed off for renovation, sunlight pours through stained-glass windows into chambers replete with gold-leafed pillarets and silver-plated candelabras. 
 A short distance away, the Governor and the Legislature bemoan the state's penury in chambers about as sumptuous as a subway station. The Governor's staff works in cramped, threadbare offices; the Assembly meets in what used to be the cafeteria.
The $63 million renovation project was intended to restore the Legislature's chambers to the glory of the Gilded Age. But the renovation project, begun in 1987, illustrates the change in New Jersey's fortunes since the 1980's, when a flush and self-confident state could afford to buy historically accurate mahogany desks at $7,000 a pop.
When reconstruction began, New Jersey was riding a wave of economic growth. State coffers were filled with cash, and its politicians were filled with confidence. This week, with the state $1.5 billion in the red and the renovation one month away from completion, the project seems less a monument to the 1890's than to the 1980's.
 "We want to retain that feeling, the richness of the 19th Century," said Matthew Shalifoux, the preservation architect charged with restoring the State House to its former grandeur. "It's really unfortunate the way these buildings have been treated all these years."
The State House, by the banks of the Delaware River is something of an architectural mishmash, Mr. Shalifoux said. It began as a modest mansion in 1792 and grew, piece by piece, style by style, well into the 20th century.
 
What's Today's Rumor?
 The Assembly chamber, built in 1891, is a gem, Mr. Shalifoux said. Beneath its 45-foot-high ceiling, the room contains Arabesque stained glass windows, a Roman arch, and a carpet dotted with images of the official state bird (the Eastern Gold Finch), the state tree (the red oak), and the state insect (the honeybee). The only complaint about the chamber so far has come from an equestrian society, offended by the absence of the official state animal, the horse.
Next door, the Senate chamber, built in 1903, is more sedate, with murals depicting figures of Liberty and Prosperity.
In bleaker sections of the State House, politicians, lobbyists, union officials and reporters mill about in hallways, exchanging rumors about the three-way tug of war involving the state's top Democrats.
Mr. Florio, who is now pursuing the cause of smaller government with the same passion that he pursued tax increases last year, has said that to save the state's bond rating, public employee unions must either make concessions under their existing contracts or face layoffs.
Months ago, after saying he had heard public outrage over his tax package of last year, the Governor promised there would be no new taxes in his $14.3 billion budget.
On Monday, the Assembly Speaker, Joseph V. Doria, undermined the Governor by declaring he could balance the budget without layoffs, without union concessions, and without severe cuts to popular programs like higher education.
So incensed was the Governor by Wednesday evening that he ordered his aides to begin a public attack on Mr. Doria with the fierceness he usually reserves for Republicans. Mr. Florio's assistants were told to draft a public statement calling Mr. Doria's budget so unbalanced that it would force the state to lay off an additional 6,000 workers. At the last moment, cooler heads prevailed.
The third player in all this is the Democratic President of the Senate, John A. Lynch, who has taken a position somewhere between the other two. Mr. Lynch said that some layoffs were inevitable, but that there need not be as many as the Governor has in mind.
In private, Mr. Lynch has told Mr. Doria that with some of the desperate fiscal devices the state is using to balance the budget this year -- like the $400 million sale of a highway to the New Jersey Turnpike Authority -- the three men can't suddenly announce they have found enough money to pay everyone's salary and finance popular programs.
"The Assembly budget just doesn't make sense," said one Senate Democrat. "How can you do something so loony as the road sale, and then act as if we are not in a crisis? We have to show blood. We have to show broken bones."
 
 The Budget Myth

By late today, Mr. Lynch and Mr. Doria were still bickering over a $200 million difference between their budget plans, and, their aides said, both men were becoming increasingly agitated that they happen to live in the same state.
One saving grace, all sides agreed, was that New Jersey always approves its budget by the July 1 deadline. It is a common understanding in the State House that the 1947 New Jersey Constitution, unlike New York State's, leaves no provision to run the state without a new budget in place.
In fact, that may just be a useful myth.
Albert Porroni, the executive director of the Office of Legislative Services, a nonpartisan arm of the Legislature, said that there is a provision in the state's appropriation law that allows the state to operate without a new budget for another month, although the state could not enter any new contracts or spend money not appropriated in the previous fiscal year. While not impossible, Mr. Porroni said, slipping by the deadline would be very messy.
"The question is one of tradition and precedent," Mr. Porroni said.
 
 Pennies From Heaven?
 In 1891, Gov. Leon Abbett ordered the construction of a glorious new General Assembly Chamber, using money whose source was never documented, at a cost no one knows, said Mr. Shalifoux, the preservation architect. A century later, Governor Abbett's successor would undoubtedly welcome such a mysterious windfall.

HEADLINE: New Policies, Old SLogans in Ethiopia

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MEKELE, Ethiopia

 BODY:
When they took power in Addis Ababa, the national capital, in May, the Ethiopian guerrillas of Tigre Province insisted that their policies were democratic and capitalist, and skeptics pointed to the guerrillas' longtime espousal of Communist ideology.
But here in their provincial capital, where they have ruled for two years, the guerrillas appear to be making good on their newly adopted word. 
 People in Mekele say the Tigrean administrators have established a popularly elected local legislature, cut business taxes, abolished price controls and repealed many of the travel restrictions on merchants enforced by the ousted Communist Government of Col. Mengistu Haile Mariam.
 
An Economic Rebound
 Local merchants say Mekele's economy is rebounding from the stagnation it suffered under the Mengistu Government, though the people in this city, once known for fine castles, mosques and churches, travel the unpaved streets in horse-drawn buggies and wear clothes made of burlap sacks.
But the new policy line is not consistent with many of the symbols and and language still heard here and in the capital. Banners and signs on major streets and Government offices in Mekele still depict a hammer and sickle intersected by a Kalashnikov rifle, the insignia of the Marxist-Leninist League of Tigre, which seems to be in no hurry to change its name. Invective against "anti-people elements" and "the ruling class" creeps into radio broadcasts and newspaper articles here and in Addis Ababa. Journalists in the capital say that every word they write must follow a line set by the provisional Government.
Officials insist that the banners and names and phrases are misleading.
 
'Don't Be Confused by Symbols'
 "The hammer and sickle are the symbols of workers and peasants, which are the primary classes of the democratic struggle," said Aregash Adam, one of 10 members of the Tigrean movement's administrative committee governing the province. "But don't be confused by symbols. We believe in a multiparty system and we believe that farmers and merchants should be free to work as they wish."
The Tigrean acting president in Addis Ababa, Meles Zenawi, announced with much fanfare on his arrival in the capital in early June that his movement now supports a market economy, multiparty democracy and broad civil liberties. Mr. Meles has repeatedly expressed interest in forming close ties with the United States, and Washington has reciprocated by providing timely humanitarian aid and endorsing Tigrean efforts to broaden their provisional Government by including other political groups.
Although the Tigrean leaders have left all major policy decisions pending for the coming transitional government, there have been hints of Tigrean pragmatism in their control of the provisional Government. The Tigreans have retained the civil service of the old Government and told at least one international humanitarian agency to buy food from individual peasants rather than from a state farm.
 
Albania Was Model
 These same Tigrean rebels used to look to Albania for ideological guidance. But the Tigreans say that after fighting for 15 years they have won their victory at a time when Communism has been discredited throughout Africa and the third world.
The Tigrean rebel group originated among Tigrean students at Addis Ababa University who felt that they were discriminated against by members of the Amhara ethnic group who dominated the Mengistu Government. Mr. Meles, a medical student, and other young Tigreans took to the mountains of their home province to mount a guerrilla war in the mid-1970's.
Their stated goals were for creating a peasant-based form of Communism and autonomy for their province from the central Government. They eventually formed a loose alliance with Marxist guerrillas fighting for independence in neighboring Eritrea province.
 
Overthrow of Mengistu
 After overthrowing Colonel Mengistu in May, the Tigreans formed a provisional Government in Addis Ababa while the Eritreans formed their own provisional Government in Asmara. The Tigreans, Eritreans and other political groups are scheduled to hold a conference in July to create a transitional government that will lead Ethiopia until elections can be held.
The provisional Eritrean government says it will hold a separate referendum within two years to decide whether the Red Sea province should become independent, according to an agreement reached between the Eritreans and the Tigreans.
Tigrean leaders here said that while fighting in the mountains they learned that such practices of the Mengistu Government as forming cooperatives and forcibly relocating peasants to more fertile lands, incited resistance from farmers. The rebels won popular support by promising the peasants that they could migrate at will and farm their land without interference.
"We are byproducts of the 1960's and 1970's, when Marxism-Leninism was fashionable on university campuses everywhere," noted Yemani Kidane, a central committee member of the Tigre People's Liberation Front. "There are aspirations to have a socialist state, but that cannot be installed until the people accept such a policy. The democratic revolution must be consolidated first."
 
Rebels' Victory Celebrated
 While the Tigrean-dominated provisional Government was received with coolness and even hostility in Addis Ababa, the takeover of the capital was greeted here with a 36-hour citywide party complete with dancing in the streets and celebratory shooting into the air.
Much of the enthusiastic support seems to be expressed in Mekele's central market, a very un-Marxist setting where peasants sell grass weavings and coffee beans or trade their produce for used clothes.
"I don't worry about the Marxist talk," said Abdela Badrik, 32, sitting behind the counter of his hardware store chewing a narcotic leaf called chat, popular in Ethiopia. "They meet with the merchants and traders every month and whatever we want, we get."
Tesfalidet Demssie, a 34-year-old pharmacist, said that under the old Government he was always short of medicines. "Now there are no restraints," he said. "We bring what we need from Asmara, Sudan, wherever."

HEADLINE: Iraqis Fire to Bar U.N. Inspectors; 'We Can't Allow This,' Bush Says

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, June 28

 BODY:
Iraqi soldiers defied United Nations inspectors today for the third time this week, firing warning shots over the inspectors' heads and again preventing them from investigating machinery that the United States says Iraq is using to make nuclear weapons, diplomats said.
The move caused concern in Washington, where President Bush said, "We can't allow this." He hinted at the use of force to make Iraq cooperate fully with the United Nations plan to destroy its weapons of mass destruction as part of the cease-fire agreement that ended the Persian Gulf war. 
 Mr. Bush said the evidence that Iraq was violating the United Nations accord was "incontrovertible, unarguable, clear."
At about the same time, in Baghdad, the Iraqi Information Ministry said President Saddam Hussein had ordered all ministries to cooperate fully with the United Nations inspectors.
Tonight, the United Nations Security Council issued a unanimous statement ordering Iraq to hand over immediately the equipment that the United Nations inspectors wanted to examine. The Council sent a high-level team to Baghdad and warned that any further Iraqi resistance would have "serious consequences" for Baghdad.
The shooting incident occurred early this morning at the town of Fallujah, east of Baghdad, when United Nations inspectors, acting on a tip from American intelligence, tried to enter a military compound to examine trucks parked there. They were refused admission and then chased off with gun shots as they sought to photograph the convoy's hurried departure.
 
Bush 'Very Concerned'
 United Nations officials and Western diplomats here say they believe that the machinery on the trucks is the same that an earlier team sought to inspect when it unsuccessfully tried to enter an army barracks north of Baghdad on Sunday.
"We're concerned about it, very concerned about it," Mr. Bush said in Washington, after he met with Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, Gen. Colin L. Powell, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Brent Scowcroft, the national security adviser.
"From the U.S. standpoint, we can't allow this brutal bully to go back on this solemn agreement and to threaten people that are there under U.N. jurisdiction," Mr. Bush said later, referring to Iraq's earlier pledge to cooperate with the identification and destruction of all its nuclear, chemical and biological weapons as well as ballistic missiles as part of the cease-fire agreement.
Asked what the United States planned to do, Mr. Bush said, "Stay tuned."
While Administration officials would not say what, if any, decisions the President made today, they made it clear that the Administration would not let Iraq hold on to its nuclear bomb-making equipment and that Washington feels that it has the legal and political justification for taking any action.
The last paragraph of the Security Council's cease-fire resolution says members can take "such further steps as may be required for the implementation of this resolution and to secure peace and security in the area." The language appears to leave the door open to virtually any action if Iraq refuses to hand over its weapons of mass destruction.
In Baghdad, the Information Ministry said Mr. Hussein had "authorized the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to order at once that all parties and organs concerned allow, with no hesitation, the United Nations representatives to see or inspect what they wish."
"The President has ordered all responsible authorities to cooperate in full with the United Nations representatives and make their mission easy in line with commitments given by Iraq," the statement continued, adding that Mr. Hussein gave these orders today at a meeting of the ruling Revolution Command Council.
 
'Flagrant Violations,' U.N. Says
 The statement approved unanimously by the Security Council at its meeting tonight expressed "grave concern" at Iraq's "flagrant violations" of its cease-fire terms this week.
The statement said the inspectors must have "immediate and unheeded access" to any site they wish to investigate and warned of further consequences for Baghdad if it failed to comply.
The United Nations team sent to Baghdad tonight includes Rolf Ekeus, who is head of the special United Nations commission overseeing the destruction of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction; Hans Blix, Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna, which is assisting the commission, and Yashushi Akashi, the United Nations Under Secretary General in charge of disarmament affairs.
 
Sanctions Remain in Force
 As long as Iraq is in violation of the cease-fire terms by not cooperating with the destruction of its most dangerous weapons, the Security Council's economic sanctions will remain in force.
The incident today is the third in which Iraq has hindered United Nations experts from inspecting a consignment of heavy equipment that American officials say they believe contains machines called calutrons. The calutrons can be used to enrich uranium up to weapons-grade level by an electromagnetic technique now considered obsolete.
On Sunday and again on Tuesday the inspectors, acting on another tip from American intelligence, were denied entry to the army barracks at Abu Gharaib, north of Baghdad, although they could see equipment being loaded by crane and forklift onto trucks.
When the inspectors finally got into the site on Wednesday, the trucks had vanished and the barracks was empty.
At a closed Security Council briefing Wednesday, American officials showed reconnaissance photographs to back their assertion that Iraq has been moving and sometimes burying equipment used in making nuclear arms, apparently to conceal it from the inspectors.
 
Convoy's Route Traced
 After the inspectors were refused admission to the Abu Gharaib barracks until the trucks had left, American intelligence apparently succeeded in tracking the convoy to a military transport base at Fallujah on the Euphrates River about 40 miles west of Baghdad, officials said.
An inspection team lead by Acting Chief Inspector David Kay, an American nuclear safeguards expert on loan from the International Atomic Energy Agency, sought entry to the base early this morning. While the 18-member team waited outside, some inspectors climbed a watertower overlooking the camp and saw drivers rushing to their heavily loaded trucks and driving off through a back gate.
Several inspectors then dashed to the far side of the camp and started photographing and filming some 60 trucks as the moved out of the camp to the south.
But Iraqi soldiers drove the inspectors away by firing pistol and rifle shots over their heads, although the inspectors were all wearing United Nations insignia and driving white vehicles with United Nations markings.
United Nations officials say they believe that the trucks were carrying the calutrons.

HEADLINE: New Limits Set On Job Hours For Students

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, June 28

 BODY:
The Legislature voted today to make New York's child-labor law one of the strictest in the nation, sharply limiting the number of hours youths can work while in school and prohibiting them from working past 10 P.M. on school nights without permission from their parents and teachers.
The new regulations, which Gov. Mario M. Cuomo is expected to sign into law, stem from recommendations made three years ago by a task force appointed by State Labor Commissioner Thomas F. Hartnett. The panel cited several national studies that concluded that the homework of many students suffered because of excessive work hours. 
 Similar bills had failed in the last two legislative sessions. This one succeeded in part because negotiatiors were finally able to agree on a provision that would allow youths to work later if they demonstrated that they could keep up their grades.
 
Something Done for Schools
 But in a year in which budget problems forced lawmakers to slash aid to local school districts, the new law also appeared to serve as a cost-free way for legislators to assert that they had done something to raise students' academic performance.
The new regulations could prove burdensome to at least some businesses, like fast-food restaurants, that heavily employ youths. The rules could force the businesses to juggle work schedules and look for older workers for their late shifts, some industry officials said today.
Lawmakers and educators hailed the bill's passage, but many working teen-agers interviewed today seemed less than appreciative when they learned of the new regulation.
"Oh, great," said 16-year-old Keith Waters, who works at the salad bar at a Wendy's restaurant in the Albany suburb of East Greenbush and who said he was working to save money for college. "If they lowered college tuition, then maybe we wouldn't have to work so much, but that's not what they're doing."
The new rules "stink," said another 16-year-old, Jim VanVorst, who works at a Dunkin' Donuts in the same town. He said teen-agers should be allowed to work as long as they want, provided they can handle their schoolwork as well. "They should have asked us how we feel about it," he said of the lawmakers' plan. "They're not a kid. They don't know what's going on."
The manager of the Wendy's Restaurant, William McKeel, said the new law could be a giant headache, making it difficult for him to find people to work past 10 P.M. "A lot of people in the 20- to 50-year-old bracket don't want to work for fast-food wages," he said.
Fast-food jobs in some parts of the state have often proved hard to fill, although the recession has eased that somewhat, and employers have had to offer salaries above the minimum wage. Commissioner Hartnett has said that the higher wages make long hours of work all the more appealing to youths, and therefore make the restrictions more urgent.
In a separate development here today, the Legislature left town for the weekend without extending the state's 15-year-old item-pricing law, which requires that supermarkets put individual price stickers on most items they sell. But some consumer groups said they were not disappointed because, they said, the lapsing of the state measure means that officials may now enforce more stringent local laws in New York City and surrounding counties that the state law had superseded.
 
48 Hours to 28
 The provisions of the new child-labor bill vary depending on the age of the youth, but in most cases they put new limits on both the length of time and the particular hours of the day a student may work.
For 17-year-olds, for instance, the present limit of 48 hours a week would be cut to 28. That would be the lowest figure any state except for California and Pennsylvania, which have the same limit as New York, said Leonard Durski, New York's coordinator of child-labor laws.
All of New York's neighboring states -- New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts and Vermont -- allow 16- and 17-year-olds to work at least 40 hours a week while in school, and until at least 11 P.M., except in Massachusetts, where they must stop at 10 P.M.
And while New York's students are now allowed to work until midnight when school is in session, under the new law they would have to stop at 10 P.M. unless they had written permission from their parents and school officials to work later.
Tennessee, Indiana and New Jersey have also set up parental-approval provisions for allowing youths to work late, but New York is the first state to require school authorization as well, said Kathleen Meehan Do, the spokeswoman for the Labor Department.
The bill does not force students to meet specific schoolwork requirements in order to work later, but it stipulates that schools provide employers with certification that the students are in "good academic standing."
Federal regulations limit 14- and 15-year-olds to 18 hours of work a week while they are in school.
 
Summer Is an Exception
 Because school is out for summer, the effect of the new law will not be felt until the fall: 17-year-olds will continue to be allowed to work for 48 hours a week when school is not in session.
The chief sponsors of the bill are the chairmen of the labor committees in their respective houses: James J. Lack, a Republican State Senator from Suffolk County, and Frank J. Barbaro, a Democratic Assemblyman from Brooklyn. They have said that while work can be beneficial to youths, too much of it could sap their zeal for studying.
Governor Cuomo praised the bill in a statement today, saying it "insures that work obligations will not lessen the energy and commitment young people should bring to their school work."
But the executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, Norman Siegel, said the new laws appeared overly broad. "It's not the government's role to tell students and parents how to live their lives," he said. He said he anticipated that some youths may file legal challenges.
The item-pricing law that covers supermarket goods will expire on Sunday at midnight. New York City has a stronger law, which essentially requires grocers to put price stickers on everything they sell, and the city's Consumer Affairs Commissioner, Mark Green, has pledged to enforce that law once the state requirement expires.
Consumer advocates favor the item-pricing laws, saying they help shoppers to compare prices and to verify that the price marked is what they pay at the checkout counter. Grocers say it adds unnecessary costs to the goods.

HEADLINE: Conflict in Yugoslavia;
EUROPEANS SEND HIGH--LEVEL TEAM

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LUXEMBOURG, Saturday June 29

 BODY:
Scrambling to forestall further worsening of the Yugoslav crisis, the European Community sent a high-level mediation team Friday to Belgrade aimed at bringing the federal Government and the rebel republics of Slovenia and Croatia back to the bargaining table.
After meeting Friday night with Prime Minister Ante Markovic of Yugoslavia in Belgrade and with Presidents Milan Kucan of Slovenia and Franjo Tudjman of Croatia in Zagreb, the capital of Croatia, the mediation team announced early today that all parties had agreed to measures to end the conflict. 
 Before the meetings, European officials here said the mission would warn Belgrade that almost $1 billion in economic aid would be suspended if its military offensive against Slovenia and Croatia continued. Officials said the mission would also reiterate that the 12-nation community favors the preservation of Yugoslavia as a single entity.
The officials added that most community governments believed it would be necessary for the Yugoslav Army to return to its barracks and for Slovenia and Croatia to suspend their declarations of independence to create conditions for a resumption of negotiations. These were among the terms that the Yugoslav leaders agreed to this morning.
The mission formed by the foreign ministers of Luxembourg, Italy and the Netherlands was sent by a summit meeting of Community leaders, who postponed a debate on European integration to take up the Yugoslav crisis.
 
'The Hour of Europe'
 Shortly before leaving here Friday, Luxembourg's Foreign Minister, Jacques Poos, said European governments had a special responsibility to act in a crisis that threatened European stability. "This is the hour of Europe," he said. "It is not the hour of the Americans."
Mr. Poos also disclosed that the mission, which is expected to report back to European leaders here late today, would offer community assistance in redrafting the Yugoslav Constitution in such a way as to preserve a single federation and to grant ample autonomy to Slovenia and Croatia.
Community leaders had been expected to issue a statement Friday on Yugoslavia, but action was suspended because of disagreements over the relative importance it should give to the potentially contradictory principles of self-determination and territorial integrity.
The German Chancellor, Helmut Kohl, whose Christian Democratic party has close ties with Slovenian and Croatian Catholic parties, reportedly wanted to stress the right to self-determination along with human and minority rights. He also wanted an immediate cutoff of aid to Yugoslavia.
But President Francois Mitterrand of France responded that a suspension of aid would be more effective as a threat at this stage and he insisted, with strong British, Italian and Spanish support, that Yugoslavia's territorial integrity be defined as a priority.
"The Community should not be opposed to self-determination, but it should also not be accused of threatening territorial integrity," French officials quoted Mr. Mitterrand as telling his European colleagues.
It was eventually agreed that the three Foreign Ministers -- Mr. Poos, Hans van den Broek of the Netherlands and Gianni de Michelis of Italy -- would decide how to phrase the message.
Mr. van den Broek stressed that the mission would warn the Yugoslav authorities that they risked being isolated internationally as a result of the military offensive. "Yugoslavia is an important economic partner, but we will suspend aid if it continues like this," he said.

HEADLINE: The Fine Craft of Selecting a Piano That Isn't a Holiday for Strings Inside

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
Piano season, that time of year when children and adults begin lessons, starts in the fall, and thousands of people are beginning their search through the classified ads or visiting piano showrooms to find a suitable instrument. Anyone who wants to get a jump on the busy season should start now.
Being an informed consumer when buying a piano is harder than it is for almost any other big-ticket item. And first-time buyers often want a used piano, facing greater pitfalls. 
 "It's a horse market; it's worse than buying a used car," said Kenneth Sloane, director of the Department of Piano Technology at Oberlin College Conservatory of Music in Oberlin, Ohio. "I've seen perfectly fine instruments given away many times," he went on, "and I've seen instruments that people have had in families for years represented as priceless pieces of art, and they're just junk."
First, experts say, even if the piano is meant for the living room, do not think of it as furniture. Yes, an attractively styled case with few dents or gouges looks best, but that may have little to do with the way the piano works and sounds.
 Second, it takes an expert to get a good idea of the piano's condition. A thorough guide to buying a new or used piano, "The Piano Book," by Larry Fine, says, "Those readers who love Rube Goldberg-style mechanical contraptions will find a piano action absolutely captivating."
Each piano has its individual character, even two of the same brand and approximate age. Play the piano to see if its tone and action (the hammers, dampers and pedals) are pleasing. At the same time, the experts say, bring along a piano technician; that is what most of the people who used to be called piano tuners now call themselves. Typically, a technician will spend half an hour to 45 minutes examining an instrument, and will charge the same as for a tuning, about $50 in most cities, sometimes more in places like New York.
 This can be good advice even if you are buying a new piano. The market is full of new low-cost pianos from Asia and, more recently, eastern Europe, but the quality is variable.
 Some people bring their piano teachers. Piano technicians say teachers can determine the action or tone of a piano, but may not spot some of the manufacturing pitfalls like plastic parts, which were popular in the 50's. By now, those pianos' parts may be ready to fall apart, requiring expensive repairs.
 Many dealers offer a "finder's fee," or commission, to a piano teacher who steers a student to a purchase. The commission can take the form of a cash payment of 1 or 2 percent of the piano's cost, or a discount for the teacher on a future purchase. If you are not sure about the teacher's motivation, ask.
 As with used cars, the best values can be found in the classified ads, but so can the lemons. If you are buying from a dealer, get a warranty of six months or a year. Do not be put off by age; a piano built 60 or 70 years ago according to high standards, and has since been rebuilt, can be better than a new low-quality piano.
 
More Costly Than New
 Prices are highly variable. Frank LaPiana, of LaPiana Piano Sales Ltd., 211 West 20th Street in Manhattan, said that $1,000 to $1,700 can buy a good used vertical ("upright," studio, console and spinet) piano, but he sells used Steinway grands for up to $24,000. That is far more than some good new grands cost.
The biggest consideration for many buyers is size. A piano is about 5 feet wide. Vertical pianos are 2 to 2 1/2 feet deep, from the keyboard to the back; grands range from 4 1/2 to 9 1/2 feet deep. Both kinds need another 2 feet for the piano bench and, of course, the pianist. In measuring available space, also consider placement; grands look silly if they are crammed in with other furniture, and no piano should be in direct sunlight, near a radiator or draft, or near a window.
If you have the space and the budget, the experts advise a grand. It has better tone, and because the action relies on gravity, not springs, it permits smoother control. Grand or vertical, bigger pianos generally sound better than smaller ones.
As for electronic keyboards, most professionals in the piano industry speak of them with disdain. Mr. Sloane takes a kinder view, saying they have had one beneficial effect on acoustic pianos, squeezing low-quality instruments, "piano-shaped objects," out of the marketplace. Still, a keyboard is not generally considered a substitute for a piano.
Pianos may cost a lot, but good ones appreciate in value. Manufacturers will sometimes say pianos are a good investment; indeed, some have proved a better place to put a few thousand dollars than a mattress. Mr. Fine, in a telephone interview, said his parents paid $3,500 for a Steinway Model M grand (5 feet long) in 1966, and that it was now worth $10,000 to $12,000. A new one costs about $25,000, depending on finish.
But the investment value can be exaggerated. Mr. Fine said, "If you want to make money above inflation, you don't buy a piano. You can always make more money in a bank."
For beginners who are not sure they will stick with the instrument, a compromise is a rental. Mr. LaPiana offers pianos for rent for $65 to $75 a month, depending on size, and collects a round-trip moving fee in advance, which varies by piano and location but within New York City is $95 in buildings with no elevator. After six months, he will apply the entire amount to the purchase of that piano or another one.
 
 
PIANO LESSONS FOR THE BUYER
 Pianos are complicated, but not inscrutable. A detailed guide to new and used pianos, "The Piano Book" ( Brookside Press , 1990, $14.95) by Larry Fine, offers information at all levels, for a nonmusician shopping for the first time or for a serious pianist who doesn't know how the keyboard's mechanism works.
Mr. Fine's book lists dozens of gimmicks used by sales personnel and tips on what to look for. In diagrams, it explains the difference between an upright, studio, console and spinet, and the pricing practices of piano dealers.
The book also offers detailed directions for taking a piano apart to examine it, typical sale prices for used pianos, tips on moving a piano and brand-by-brand rundowns on quality.
Many companies, the book says, have sold "stencil pianos," pianos made by others onto which the companies stenciled their names. And used Steinways are in a category by themselves. Included is a table allowing a potential buyer to determine, by a serial number, the approximate year any Steinway was built.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS PEOPLE;
2 Economic Advisers Leaving Bush Council

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM

 BODY:
Two of the three members of President Bush's Council of Economic Advisers are leaving the Government to resume academic careers.
John B. Taylor announced yesterday that he was resigning effective Aug. 2 to return to Stanford University. Last week, Richard L. Schmalensee submitted his resignation to return to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
 Michael J. Boskin is staying in office as chairman of the council.
Among the leading candidates to fill the vacant seats are David F. Bradford, an economist at Princeton University who specializes in taxation, and Paul Wonnacott, who was the chief staff economist at the State Department and is now at the University of Maryland.
Mr. Taylor and Mr. Schmalensee are among several academicians who took leaves of absence to come to Washington at the beginning of the Bush Administration and must resume their teaching careers or relinquish their tenured university positions. Another prominent White House official who left recently is Condoleezza Rice, who went back to Stanford after working two years on the National Security Council's staff as the chief specialist on the Soviet Union.
Robert R. Glauber, the Under Secretary of the Treasury, gave up his tenure at the Harvard Business School so he could stay in the Government. He is leading the Bush Administration's drive to revamp the nation's banking system.
Normally, universities limit leaves of absence to two years, but occasionally exceptions are made. For example, Mr. Boskin's leave from Stanford was extended, and he maintains his tenure.
At the Council of Economic Advisers, Mr. Taylor concentrated mainly on economic forecasting, international trade and the financial markets. Mr. Schmalensee specialized in regulation and Eastern European affairs.

HEADLINE: A Plan to Curb Measles

 BODY:
This week a Department of Health and Human Services task force drafted a $90.9 million-a-year plan to stop the resurgence of an old scourge, measles. The plan, to take effect in October 1992, would strengthen sadly depleted immunization services for poor children. It deserves support by the President and Congress.
Measles, a disease that affected fewer than 1,500 Americans only eight years ago, claimed nearly 28,000 in 1990. Eighty-nine of them died. There are many reasons for the resurgence of measles -- medical, environmental and economic -- but no good excuse. 
 In January, to his credit, President Bush asked for $258 million, an 18 percent increase, for the Federal immunization program that protects children against diseases like measles, mumps and diphtheria. Just last week he announced he would send a team of officials to six cities "to learn why kids aren't getting immunized."
But people like Dr. David R. Smith, director of primary care at Dallas's Parkland Memorial Hospital, already know why. Too much red tape -- and too little money. In Dallas, with 3,000 cases and 12 deaths in the last 10 months, 95 percent of the children who got the disease had been in the health-care system. But they hadn't been vaccinated. That would have cost about $45,000 in public funds. Not having done so will cost at least $1 million in public funds, for Medicaid bills.
As Dr. Smith says, "If we can't fix measles, we might as well give up."

HEADLINE: Europe Shops for a Ballot Box

BYLINE: By Flora Lewis; Flora Lewis is Senior Columnist of The New York Times.

DATELINE: PARIS

 BODY:
First, catch a rabbit. This instruction for rabbit stew also applies to democracy. First decide on it and acquire the major ingredient: freedom to choose. Then the recipe is still needed, but its contents are not so obvious. East European countries are confronting the recipe problem, with serious tensions in Poland. So are older democracies, including Italy.
Poland, which is to have its first completely free parliamentary vote in October, is disputing the electoral law. President Lech Walesa, chosen by direct universal suffrage, wants legislative candidates to run only on party lists, a way he considers sure to exclude former Communists. Solidarity and ex-Communist deputies want people listed by their names only, giving independents a chance. 
Presidential powers were significantly strengthened as part of the compromise that provided partly free elections in 1989, leading to a Solidarity Government. Mr. Walesa's stand derives from his personality: he wants still more power. The issue he chose is the method of electing legislators.
Earlier in the century, political theorists looking for a formula to make voters' choices more effective came up with proportional representation. Tried in a few American states, it caught on widely in Europe. The theorists argued that single-member constituencies distorted election results by giving equal rewards to a tiny margin or an overwhelming majority of voters and permanently blocking smaller parties or those with geographically diffuse supporters.
 In practice, proportional representation has turned out to favor too many splinter parties, often forcing unnatural coalitions or paralyzing governments and giving decisive power to party apparatuses rather than the citizens' chosen candidate.
Under this system, opportunities for election depend on a candidate's place on the party list, not on individual popularity. Israel adopted the most extreme form of the system and has never been able to reform it because incumbents don't bite the system that feeds them.
Eastern Europeans are surveying the West's assorted methods of governing and trying to figure out what will suit them. Experimentation is risky, all are going through social and economic crises, but they can't wait very long for decisive government.
The systems of various countries are being studied as models and one way or another are found wanting. France has the world's most powerful presidency, more powerful than America's because there is no clear separation between executive and legislative branches. France's experiment with proportional representation was abandoned.
Italy, with a president that essentially is a figurehead and an intricate proportional representation system, has just resoundingly demanded basic political reform in a referendum. The system is thought to help entrench the Mafia, and there is a strong feeling that the president should be elected directly in order to strengthen him.
The appeal of a directly elected president has been demonstrated in in the Russian Republic. Boris Yeltsin has greatly reinforced his standing in the face of Mikhail Gorbachev, President of the Soviet Union by virtue of a vote of the Supreme Soviet, although Mr. Gorbachev retains all the major levers of state power.
The U.S. system of checks and balances with only single-member constituencies has not attracted imitators because it is considered cumbersome and inappropriate for most countries.
People everywhere want to participate in power and they want responsive, effective government. Is that a contradiction? The answer has to be no. But generalities and pious pledges give no assurance. Existing structures are disappointing, and there is a search for better solutions. Fortunately, the greatest strength of democracy over all those methods of government Churchill found worse is that it can try, err and correct.

HEADLINE: $139.5 Billion in Securities Issued in Quarter

BYLINE: By KURT EICHENWALD

 BODY:
Corporate America found the public markets to be a trove of cash in the second quarter, as the economic euphoria that followed the end of the Persian Gulf war continued in the capital markets.
And bucking a two-year trend, fees paid to investment firms went up. 
 American corporations raised $139.5 billion in the second quarter, up 67.3 percent from the $83.4 billion that was raised in the second quarter of last year, according to IDD Information Services, a research firm in New York.
In the first six months of 1991, corporations issued a $249.7 billion in domestic securities, a 52.4 percent increase over the $163.8 billion raised in the first half of 1990, according to IDD.
 
Drop in Interest Rates

The determining factor in the push to raise capital was the decline of interest rates, underwriters said, as well as the end of the uncertainty in the five months before the Persian Gulf war. Companies had been holding out for lower rates as long as a year, and, when the drop came, they plunged into the markets. For their part, institutional investors, uncertain of the direction of the markets, sat on hoards of cash until the conflict was resolved. As time passed, those investors became more selective.
"The market at the beginning of the quarter was indiscriminate," said Dave Komanski, executive vice president of global equity markets at Merrill Lynch & Company. "We did see a change throughout the quarter from what I would classify as a feeding frenzy at the beginning to the point where the buy side became very selective by the end of the quarter."
 
The Biggest Changes
 For the quarter, the biggest changes in business were in the secondary-issue market for equities and in the "junk bond" market. Some $13.6 billion in such equity was issued, compared with $3.1 billion in the second quarter of 1990.
And the once-moribund junk bond market showed strength, with $2.5 billion raised in the quarter, compared with $706.7 million in the second quarter of last year.
That frenzy and subsequent continued purchasing pushed Wall Street fees upward for the first time in years. In the first six months, fees grew faster than new issues, according to IDD. Fees increased 60 percent in the first six months of the year to $1.95 billion, from $1.21 billion in the comparable period in 1990.
The size of the rebound is partly a result of the markets' poor performance last year, when Wall Street slipped into the weakest environment since 1974. And the first six months of 1990 saw the collapse of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the former powerhouse that led the junk bond market. That market began to recover only in the last six months.
Also, contributing to the growth in fees was the explosion of equity issues, both initial public offerings and secondary offerings. With Duracell, Ann Taylor and other companies coming to market with huge offerings in the last quarter, fees were virtually guaranteed to climb rapidly.
The fees for secondary offerings rose to $691.4 million from $252.6 billion in the comparable period last year.
Fees from preferred stock offerings also grew rapidly to $139.1 million, from the $54.2 million raised in the first six months of 1990.
Holding onto the spot it won from Salomon Brothers three years ago, Merrill Lynch continued as the biggest underwriter on Wall Street.
For the first six months, Merrill underwrote $47.9 billion in domestic securities, giving it 19.2 percent of the total market, an increase from $26.6 billion in the first six months of 1990, according to IDD. Goldman, Sachs & Company was second, underwriting $33.8 billion of securities for 13.5 percent of the market.
Lehman Brothers was the surprise of the top underwriters, jumping from No. 6 to No. 3. The firm underwrote $25.4 billion for 10.2 percent of the market. Morgan Stanley & Company, which was No. 3 a year ago, dropped to sixth place this year.
 
Up From $145.3 Billion
 The vast majority of the cash was raised through debt securities. The total amount of nonconvertible debt raised during the six months was $213.4 billion, up from $145.3 billion a year earlier, according to IDD.
While the dollar volume of intial public offerings rose during the period, the number of such offerings fell. During the six months, 133 of such offerings went to market, raising $8 billion,compared with 137 raising $6.9 billion in the first six months of 1990.

BYLINE: By GEORGE JOHNSON

 BODY:
BREAK AND ENTER, by Colin Harrison. (Avon, $4.95.) While his mother is suffering from cancer and his marriage is falling apart, an assistant district attorney in Philadelphia tries to solve a double murder. "In this intensely felt first novel, Mr. Harrison heroically balances the philosophical drama of a man's crisis of faith with the puzzle-narrative of a legal whodunit," Marilyn Stasio said here last year.
THE POLITICS OF RICH AND POOR: Wealth and the American Electorate in the Reagan Aftermath, by Kevin Phillips. (Harper Perennial, $9.95.) Like the Gilded Age of the 1880's and 90's and the Roaring 20's, the 1980's were a time of tax cuts, deregulation, weakening of the unions, financial speculation, runaway debt and an increase in the number of millionaires. And now as then, Kevin Phillips predicts, the excesses of the rich will lead to a backlash of populism. "Drawing on an array of basic economic data, Mr. Phillips succeeds in placing the carryings-on that make headlines against the background of a wider trend toward markedly greater inequality of income and concentration of wealth," Dennis H. Wrong said here last year. 
 WHAT I HAVE TO TELL YOU, by Mary Elsie Robertson. (Laurel, $8.99.) Jessie Farquarson makes no progress in her search for her missing husband, Dwayne, until she consults a psychic who lives on an island near Seattle. In 1989 our reviewer, Regina Weinreich, said the author is "at her best when describing the down-to-earth -- for example, in telling how Jessie is wooed by the hapless Dwayne, whose idea of a good time is collecting ants and watching them race across the kitchen table."
WHAT'S THAT PIG OUTDOORS? A Memoir of Deafness, by Henry Kisor. (Penguin, $8.95.) The book editor of The Chicago Sun-Times tells what it was like for a deaf person to pursue a career in journalism. "Henry Kisor's book, with its solid core of Emersonian self-reliance, may well become an American classic," Carlton Lake said here last year.
A SMALL TOWN, by Shelby Hearon. (Warner, $9.95.) As seismologists roam the town, trying to predict when the next big one will come, the people of Venice, Mo., find diversion in the scandalous goings-on of Alma van der Linden, the doctor's daughter who married her high school principal and is now working as a reporter on the town newspaper. In 1985 our reviewer, Elizabeth Tallent, said " 'A Small Town" is fine in dealing with the funny malaise of childhood, those small-town seizures of ennui."
GORBACHEV: Heretic in the Kremlin, by Dusko Doder and Louise Branson. (Penguin, $9.95.) "The central paradox of Gorbachev's rule," the authors write, is that "the more he sought to disperse power, the more he found it necessary to concentrate power in his own hands." Last year our reviewer, Marshall D. Shulman, said this book provides "a useful reminder for general readers of the roller-coaster volatility of the tumultuous events of the last five years."
L.A. CONFIDENTIAL, by James Ellroy. (Mysterious Press, $5.99.) This novel about Los Angeles in the 1950's centers on the stories of three corrupt policemen, each obsessed with a different crime. "There must be a hundred characters -- give or take some fractional body parts -- embroiled in all the interlocking plots and subplots about the 'astounding audacious perversion' of the period," Marilyn Stasio said here last year.
THE THROWING MADONNA: Essays on the Brain, by William H. Calvin. (Bantam, $13.) A neurophysiologist speculates that women, clutching their babies with one arm and throwing stones with the other, may be responsible for the development of right-handedness, language and sequential reasoning. The author provides "a great deal of information in bite-sized essays that are easy to read," Maya Pines said here in 1983.
BONES AND SILENCE, by Reginald Hill. (Dell, $4.50.) While rehearsing to play God in a local mystery play, Andy Dalziel, a police superintendent in Yorkshire, tries to catch a murderer and find an anonymous woman who keeps making heartbreaking suicide threats. "No other genre author, P. D. James and Ruth Rendell included, writes with such feeling and understanding of silently unhappy women," Marilyn Stasio said here last year.
BITTER VICTORY: The Battle for Sicily, 1943, by Carlo D'Este. (Harper Perennial, $14.95.) Gen. Sir Harold Alexander's battle to take Sicily in World War II was a case study in mismanagement, the author concludes. "Carlo D'Este, a retired American Army lieutenant colonel, is a fine military writer," Walter Lord said here in 1988. He has "great imagination in using his materials. And he is utterly candid." The publisher has also reissued DECISION IN NORMANDY ($14.95), Mr. D'Este's critique of another British general, Field Marshal Viscount Montgomery. "It is the best-researched, best-reasoned, best-written account of that campaign I have read," Drew Middleton said here in 1984.
"G" IS FOR GUMSHOE, by Sue Grafton. (Fawcett Crest, $5.95.) Kinsey Millhone, the California private eye, is the target of a hired assassin. Last year our reviewer, Alex Kozinski, said Sue Grafton "certainly knows how to turn a phrase and has a playful eye for detail."

HEADLINE: THEATER;
Theater's Godfather Reaches Entr'acte

BYLINE: By HILARY DE VRIES; Hilary de Vries writes about theater and film for The Los Angeles Times and other publications.

 BODY:
It tells you something about Lloyd Richards that when asked to assess his career in the American theater, one that spans nearly half a century, he tells a story about other people.
"John Guare once said to me, 'I have needs as a playwright,' " says Mr. Richards. " 'I need a place where I can work, but I also need to have my picture in the newspapers.' What he was saying was that he wanted to be a playwright and to be acknowledged as a playwright. He wanted a life in the theater." 
 If any individual has been pivotal in helping playwrights and other artists find homes in the American theater, it has been Lloyd Richards. From his first public success -- directing Lorraine Hansberry's groundbreaking drama "A Raisin in the Sun" on Broadway in 1959 -- to his continuing collaboration with the playwright August Wilson, Mr. Richards has served as adviser and enabler to some of the country's finest theatrical talent.
In the five decades that he has been working -- as a radio announcer in Detroit before World War II, as an unknown Off Broadway actor during the 50's and now as a Tony Award-winning director and leader in the nation's regional theater movement -- Mr. Richards has commanded as much influence in the country as any theater figure working outside Broadway.
In the last 12 years he has held four major positions -- artistic director of the Yale Repertory Theater, dean of the Yale School of Drama, director of the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center's annual playwright's conference, and member of the national council, the advisory body for the National Endowment for the Arts. In those posts he has influenced the careers of such actors as Sidney Poitier, James Earl Jones and Charles Dutton and such playwrights, in addition to Mr. Wilson, as Lee Blessing, Athol Fugard and Wole Soyinka, the Nigerian Noble Prize winner.
 "You see Lloyd's influence everywhere," says Zelda Fichandler, former artistic director of the Arena Stage in Washington and artistic director of the Acting Company in New York. "You see it in playwriting, the notion of developing a play, in the numbers of African-American actors working, in casting classical works with people of color, and in his merging a school with a functioning theater."
Indeed, in the American regional theater movement Mr. Richards's preferred role has been that of teacher, mentor, nurturer. Even on the eve of his retirement from Yale (he will be officially replaced next month by Stan Wojewodski Jr., the former artistic director of Center Stage in Baltimore), Mr. Richards's influence persists.
He describes his aims simply: "There is a social and political conscience to everything I do." This personal agenda has helped broaden the nation's cultural parameters, especially through increased ethnic diversity in the American theater and play development.
As director of that original production of "Raisin," Mr. Richards is regarded as among the first artists to unveil middle-class black family life to white audiences that had not yet encountered the civil rights struggles of the 60's. Edith Oliver of The New Yorker has said of that seminal production, "It opened up a whole way of life to all of us."
Twenty years later, Mr. Richards was using his positions at Yale to create an artistic home for Mr. Fugard's excoriating South African dramas and Mr. Wilson's searing black history plays. Mr. Fugard's " 'Master Harold' . . . and the Boys" and "The Road to Mecca" had their world premieres at Yale, as have all of Mr. Wilson's works (under Mr. Richards's direction), from "Ma Rainey's Black Bottom," "Fences" and "Joe Turner's Come and Gone" to last year's "Two Trains Running." Mr. Wilson has said of his director, mentor and colleague, "because of Lloyd, I found a home in the theater. I will follow him wherever he goes."
To talk with the soft-spoken director about his accomplishments is to encounter a study in self-effacement. Short, compact and bespectacled -- the playwright Wendy Wasserstein, a former student, once called him "the black Santa Claus" -- Mr. Richards looks every inch the paterfamilias. He is also something of an enigma, an intensely private man even to those who know him well.
And on a recent early morning, in the living room of his town house on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, Mr. Richards is a study in watchful affability. Although he has spent much of his time in university housing during his Yale tenure, for the last 20 years this has been his home -- a serene, loftlike space of exposed brick walls and hardwood floors that is furnished in antiques, African art, musical instruments and family photographs. But even now, even here, he dismisses attempts to sum up his career -- "That's a look back, and I'm not ready to do that." Rather, he discusses his accomplishments in terms of other artists (he refers to his relationship with Mr. Wilson as the "culmination" of his career) and institutions, be it the National Endowment, the O'Neill or Yale.
"My commitment to theater has had a great deal to do with the drama school," he says in his slow, narrative style. "I started out to make the kind of school that I would have liked to have gone to. Training people -- creating a bridge into the profession -- that's what I consider valuable."
He was considered a master teacher of acting whose resume included teaching positions at New York University, Hunter College and the O'Neill when A. Bartlett Giamatti tapped him in 1979 to replace Robert Bru stein as dean of the Yale School of Drama and artistic director of the theater. Mr. Brustein and Mr. Giamatti had been involved in an acrimonious dispute over the future of the drama school, which ended with Mr. Bru stein's departure.
For Mr. Richards, the next 12 years proved to be career-making. He established his reputation and cemented the standing of the school by transforming it into the most prestigious professional drama training program in the country. He increased the number of minority students and faculty members and reoriented the repertory theater from an avant-garde, director-dominated company into a writer's theater with a commitment to social concerns.
The focus of his attention was the repertory theater and he served mainly as an administrator, delegating much of the actual running of the school. Occasionally he was stretched so thin because of duties at the O'Neill center and the National Endowment that he gained a reputation among some students and faculty members as an absentee landlord. One year a petition was circulated by the students, demanding, "Where are you, Lloyd?"
"Lloyd put the rep and the school on solid ground while validating August Wilson, the most important black American voice in the commercial arena," says David Chambers, an assistant professor in Yale's directing program. "Many see the end of his tenure with both deep resentment about what has been read as his inattention to the school as well as deep respect for what he has achieved as an individual."
Athol Fugard already had a worldwide reputation as a major dramatist when Mr. Richards received the script of "A Lesson From Aloes" from the playwright in 1979. The subsequent Yale production, directed by Mr. Fugard and starring James Earl Jones, later moved to Broadway. It was the start of Mr. Richards's wider renown as an artistic director and paved the way for subsequent Fugard works at Yale.
The collaborative process was repeated in 1984 when Mr. Richards discovered August Wilson's drama "Ma Rainey's Black Bottom." That play, about black jazz musicians in the 1920's, moved to Broadway. It was followed by the Pulitzer Prize-winning "Fences" (which won Mr. Richards a Tony Award in 1986), "Joe Turner's Come and Gone" and "The Piano Lesson" (a second Pulitzer) -- all productions that began at Yale, had several subsequent productions at other regional theaters and later moved to Broadway. ("Two Trains Running" will be seen at the Arena Stage and the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles, after which it is expected to come to Broadway.)
Although Mr. Richards has been criticized for his occasionally static direction and insufficient editing of Mr. Wilson, theirs remains one of the most significant director-playwright relationships in modern American theater.
"Lloyd found writers, and he stayed with them," says Arvin Brown, artistic director of the Long Wharf Theater in New Haven. "And he also worked with those writers in several regional theaters, promoting links between theaters as a collective home to new work."
Other observers, including Mr. Brustein and Rocco Landesman, the head of the Jujamcyn Theaters, were less sanguine. Mr. Brustein, who is also the theater critic of The New Republic, attacked the Broadway production of "The Piano Lesson" in a column last spring, complaining that Mr. Richards blurred the lines between the nonprofit and commercial theater and accusing him of running the Yale Rep as "a launching pad and tryout franchise for the development of Broadway products."
Mr. Richards maintains that such a relationship is part of the evolution of the American theater. "The commercial theater used to find talent and support it," he says. "Now it looks to the regional theaters as a substitute developmental arm."
Mr. Richards's interest in discovering and launching Mr. Wilson and other new playwrights strikes at what may be the central issue for him -- changing the scope and nature of American theatrical literature. "I think too often an American esthetic uses as its base Western European theater," he says. "The American theater will only come from an esthetic that takes from all the various cultural influences -- native and minority."
It is not an unexpected attitude from one who came of age in Depression-era hardship and social prejudice. Born in Canada in the early 1920's (he refuses to give the year), Mr. Richards is the son of a Jamaican carpenter. After the family moved to Detroit, his father died and his mother lost her sight. At the age of 9, Mr. Richards assumed much of the responsibility for the family. At his mother's encouragement, he studied pre-law at Wayne State University. But he also took theater classes where he discovered in acting "that sense that in being someone else you were permitted the full utilization of yourself."
After serving as one of the first black pilots in World War II, he moved to New York. For the next 20 years, he acted and directed infrequently, serving mainly as an acting coach. By 1966, his reputation as a developer of young talent was such that George White, president of the O'Neill Theater Center in Waterford, Conn., tapped him to head its summer playwrights' conference. Under his direction, the O'Neill became the model for several theater and film workshops, including Robert Redford's Sundance Institute.
Today, after 12 years of heading a regional theater, Mr. Richards sees the challenges to directors "not only as tests of economics, but also of character." Regional theaters, he says, "are confronting 25 to 30 percent cuts in their budgets. How do you face that?"
About Mr. Wojewodski, his successor, the director will say only, "I don't know Stan as an artist." Mr. Richards says he declined to be part of the selection process and adds that he does not want to evaluate the changes that Mr. Wojewodski has already implemented at Yale. For his part, the incoming director, who is 42, is taking a more hands-on approach to the school, appointing himself head of the directing program, where he will teach several courses.
 At the moment, Mr. Richards wants to spend more time at home with his wife, Barbara, a playwright, and his two sons, Thomas and Scott, while maintaining his relationship with Mr. Wilson. They have the productions of "Two Trains Running" to prepare for and possibly a London version of "The Piano Lesson."
"The satisfaction for a director," says Mr. Richards, speaking almost as much for his own life as about the theater, "is that you put it all together and watch somebody else take off with it. As a director you stand on the ground and say, 'Look at that thing go.' "

To the Editor: I visited Brazil and Chile at the end of March and beginning of April. Since Latin America is a somewhat unusual destination, because rampant inflation makes the postage denominations sky high and because the stamps are colorful and interesting, I thought it would be amusing to send postcards. I gathered addresses of friends and family, bought lots of cards, wrote messages, went to post offices in Rio de Janeiro and Santiago, asked about airmail rates to the United States, paid almost $1 per card for postage, placed the stamps on myself, marked each card airmail and mailed them myself.
It has been about two months and not a single card has arrived. The explanation cannot be that all the cards were misaddressed. I suspect that the explanation is either inefficiency or corruption. It is possible that the postal departments simply take your money and never bother to send the cards.

HEADLINE: Buying a Home Is Still an American Goal

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
DESPITE the recession and a deep real estate slump that has eroded home values in much of the nation, a large majority of Americans still consider homeownership the best long-term investment they can make, according to a New York Times poll.
When asked if they agreed with the assertion, "Buying a home is the best long-term investment in the United States," an overwhelming 84 percent of those surveyed nationwide said they strongly agreed or somewhat agreed. The responses were nearly identical in New York City, its suburbs and the Northeast, where the value of many homes has plummeted more than 25 percent since 1988. 
 "When people go back to work and salaries start going up again, so will house prices," said Glenn Skrynecki, a 36-year-old Long Island engineer and one of more than 1,900 people who took part in the poll. "If you don't own you are like a dog chasing its tail," Mr. Skrynecki said in follow-up interview.
The poll also showed that a third of Americans, 32 percent, say they want to move, but a much higher proportion of big-city residents feel that way than do those in small towns and rural areas. And in what may reflect growing financial frustration -- and an increasingly pent-up demand for housing -- only a third of those who want to move said they would be able to do so within the next year. Among all American adults, only 14 percent said they were likely to move in the next year.
Those who want a different home say a variety of economic and family concerns are standing in the way. Mostly commonly, they cite worries about their personal finances and jobs, fears that the real estate slump may not have hit bottom and the simple fact that homes cost more than they can afford.
The poll, designed to gauge attitudes of people in the nation as a whole and in the New York region, was conducted by telephone in two phases, with 1,283 people across the country interviewed from April 1 to April 3, and 639 residents of New York City and 14 surrounding counties interviewed from June 10 to June 12.
In follow-up interviews, 20 participants expressed varied levels of confidence in the near-term prospects for home values in their cities and neighborhoods. But in almost all cases they said homeownership and moving on to something better were fundamental to their families' plans.
"Around here, you can find good quality homes that are underpriced," said Jeraldine Greene, an accountant for the City of Dallas, who, with her husband, Lonzie, wants to move with their two children to something bigger than the 1,600-square-foot ranch-style house they bought in 1976.
The house has little space for entertaining. Mr. Greene, also an accountant, is an avid saxophone player but must practice in the garage. Still, even though bigger houses are available at a discount in the sluggish Dallas real estate market, the Greenes said their finances were strained by the rising cost of education, health care, clothing and other family necessities.
They plan to move, but probably not for two years.
Just east of Sacramento, where robust population growth has kept home values rising, Robert James, an industrial supplies salesman, and his wife, Joyce, have the potential of profiting handsomely. They bought their house in 1974 for $50,000 and now estimate its value at $300,000. But they want to move. The buccolic subdivision they chose in the 70's has since been surrounded by much more intense development and they want a home farther east, in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada.
"We'll do it within five years," Mrs. James said.
And on Manhattan's Upper East Side, David Palmer, an options trader, and his wife, Helen, have been renting the same rent-stabilized one-bedroom apartment since 1974. Their son, John, is a high school sophmore; when he graduates, they plan to move.
"Buying is so expensive that for 17 years we haven't figured out how to do it," said Mrs. Palmer. "But to me, owning a home means security." She added that their move would probably take them to a smaller, less congested and less expensive community than New York.
In the poll, when Americans were asked, "Are you and your family satisfied with where you live now, or would you like to move?" 46 percent of big-city residents nationwide and 42 percent of New Yorkers said they would prefer to move. In contrast, only 18 percent of those in rural areas nationwide and 24 percent in small towns around the country said they wanted to move.
The desire for a better home apparently has no direct correlation to people's income, since roughly a third of those at all income levels, from less than $15,000 a year to more than $50,000, said they wanted to move. But the proportion of blacks who said they want to move, 45 percent, was higher than among whites, 29 percent.
The poll's findings suggest that if all the Americans who want to move were to do so soon, large cities would suffer a steep loss of population. When asked where they would like to move, the largest number nationwide of those who would like to move, 30 percent, said a rural area, and the second largest group, 25 percent, said they would select a suburb. Eighteen percent of those surveyed nationwide identifed their current residence as rural and another 18 percent said they now live in the suburbs.
Among residents of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut who said they want to move, the largest number, 36 percent, said they would move to a suburb, and 43 percent out of the three states altogether.
Not surprisingly, the survey also found that people in the New York region are devoting more of their income to housing than those elsewhere. Asked if their housing bills claimed more than 25 percent of their total household income, 43 percent of New York City residents and 36 percent of those in the 19-county New York region said yes, as against 26 percent nationwide.
Although polls of American homeowners and renters are not uncommon, housing experts said they knew of no survey that would provide a direct historical comparison to the Times poll's data. But they added that the Times poll demonstrates that the real estate boom of the 1980's, followed by the recent slump that has lowered values by more than 20 percent in New York, much of New England and some other areas, had done little to dampen people's desire to own homes.
"If anything, the poll suggests an uptick in demand," said Kathryn Nelson, an economist for the Department of Housing and Urban Development who in the early 1980's analyzed a special 1979 Census Bureau survey. She found that 30 percent of the public wanted to move and that half planned to do so in the next five years.
"It is always true that more people say they want to move than actually intend to," said Anthony Downs, a housing analyst with the Brookings Institution in Washington. He added that overall demand for housing was not expected to increase dramatically in the remainder of the 1990's.
One reason is population changes, including the aging of the Baby Boom generation and increased divorce rates, which created new households at a rate of 1.7 million a year in the 1970's and 1.3 million a year in the 80's. In contrast, an average of 1.1 million new households will be formed each year until the year 2000, according to recent forecasts.
Not everyone who participated in the poll is convinced of the long-term benefits of homeownership. While the overwhelming majority said they still considered homes the "best long-term investment," 55 percent said they agreed that "buying a home is not as good an investment as it used to be."
Most also said owning a home is harder than it once was. Eighty percent agreed that "these days, owning a home takes two incomes." And 80 percent agreed that "younger people today have a harder time buying a home than their parents did, and may never be able to afford the home they need."
Christopher Infurchia of Bridgeport is one of the Americans who has not found real estate ownership rewarding. "This was supposed to be the American dream," said the 29-year-old automobile salesman, who paid $180,000 in 1986 for a two-family house. He said he bought a house when "it seemed like if you didn't buy now, you'd be completely locked out." He selected the two-family house with the hope that income from renting out the second unit would cover a large part of his mortgage payments.
But with Bridgeport in deep recession -- Connecticut's largest city filed for protection under the bankruptcy code this month -- Mr. Infurchia's apartment has been vacant for nine months. Late last year, in hope of getting bank financing, he had it appraised and found it was worth $30,000 less than he paid.
"I think I may be part of a whole generation that lost out by buying houses at the wrong time," he said.
Nevertheless, other homeowners in the New York area, even those who have watched their values decline, said their belief in homeownership was unshaken.
One is Mr. Skrynecki, who in 1986 bought a four-bedroom Colonial house in Hicksville, L.I. Since house prices have slumped on Long Island, as elsewhere in the region, he said he would now "be lucky to break even" if he sold the house.
But he added that he did not regret the purchase. Among other things, he said, the tax saving he gains by deducting mortgage interest has kept his housing costs at about the same level as if he were renting.
"I don't think we've gotten to the bottom of this slump, because I expect there are more layoffs," he said. "But I'm still convinced that you have to own your home if you are going to get anywhere."
 
 
 
HOW THE SURVEY WAS CONDUCTED

The latest New York Times Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted with separate samples nationwide and within the tristate area in and around New York City.
The national interviewing was conducted April 1 to 3 with 1,283 adults around the United States, excluding Alaska and Hawaii. The tristate interviewing was conducted June 10 to 12 with 639 adults in 19 counties of the greater New York area.
The greater New York area was defined as the five boroughs of New York City plus the Connecticut county of Fairfield, the New York State counties of Nassau, Rockland, Suffolk and Westchester, and the New Jersey counties of Bergen, Essex, Hudson, Middlesex, Monmouth, Morris, Passaic, Somerset and Union.
The nationwide sample, which utilized a computer to select telephone exchanges and to randomly form the last four digits of each telephone number, used the method employed for many years by New York Times/CBS News Polls. The numbers were screened so that calls would be placed to residences only.
The sample of telephone numbers in the greater New York area, also based on random digit dialing techniques, was drawn by Marketing Systems Group of Philadelphia, who also purged the sample of known businesses and nonworking numbers.
In both samples, within each household one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the poll.
The results from both the national and local samples have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for variations in each sample relating to race, sex, and age. The national sample was also weighted by region and education, while the local sample was weighted to reflect an accurate balance between the population of New York City and of the surrounding 14-county area.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such samples will differ by no more than a few percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all adults in the respective population: three percentage points in the case of the United States and four percentage points in the case of the greater New York area.
The potential sampling error for smaller subgroups is larger. For example, for those who say they would like to move to a new residence it is plus or minus five percentage points in the national sample, and plus or minus six percentage points in the greater New York sample.
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll.

HEADLINE: Perspectives: Commercial Leases;
Recasting Rents in City-Owned Buildings

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER

 BODY:
RAISING commercial rents is not an easy task for city government. Restructuring them for tenants in place, with no tenancy turnover, is harder still.
Restructuring means bringing rents in line with fair market values and ending the distortions that favor some tenants over others merely because they have stayed in place for a long time.
The administration of Mayor Edward I. Koch tried to raise the rents of commercial tenants in city-owned buildings slated for redevelopment on urban renewal sites, and for stores in tax-foreclosed residential buildings. 
 The plan was less than a detailed restructuring, but it nevertheless provoked an outcry by small businesses and nonprofit organizations and their elected representatives, including the man who was then Borough President of Manhattan, David N. Dinkins. Mayor Koch backed down and settled for a mild across-the-board percentage increase for the urban-renewal properties only.
Now, Mayor Dinkins's office has approved a new approach to the same objective. Fair-market rents, based on city appraisals, would be phased in over five years, with caps on the year-to-year increases for four years and a rent ceiling for nonprofits set at 50 percent of fair-market value.
There has been no announcement of the plan at City Hall, but the Department of Housing Preservation and Development provided details about it. The department has included in its revenue projections for the 1992 fiscal year, which begins tomorrow, figures based on what the first year of the phase-in is expected to generate.
Preliminary regulations are to be published for comment shortly, and a public hearing will follow. Officials expect the final regulations to come out this summer. After that they will be implemented community board by community board, chosen by random selection. A departmental appeals procedure will be provided for tenants who challenge the rent appraisals.
The history of the plan demonstrates the long-term troubles that arise when rents fail to adjust systematically to changing market conditions in different areas. In housing, this fuels the movement toward co-op conversion, even in areas where the sales market is not established. In buildings already converted it has produced a formidable gap between the housing costs of long-term renters and newly arrived co-op buyers. Ultimately the gap may undercut the co-op's finances.
In all there are 2,300 commercial properties owned and managed by the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, 1,900 of them stores in tax-foreclosed buildings. The rest are tenants in urban renewal areas, typically businesses operating garages or loft tenants who never left after condemnation. In the foreclosed properties, the housing agency estimates that 800 properties are already paying fair-market rents.
The city's rent income from all these tenancies in fiscal 1991, which ends today, is $7 million. Restructured rents should produce an additional $1 million next year and $2 million in fiscal 1993, when all the new rents are in place, officials say.
But higher rent revenues are not the agency's main goal, said Felice Michetti, Commissioner of Housing Preservation and Development.
"It's basically an equity issue," she said. "The plan has been written to mitigate hardship, but it's not conscionable to have one storefront rented at low-low rents and another next to it at 10 times the rent." That degree of distortion is not an exaggeration, she said.
The distortions arise because there is no mechanism for rent increases when leases are renewed. Rents are changed only when a tenant moves. In the last three years the city has turned to auctions to determine the vacancy values.
It is not hard to appreciate the sensitivities over this issue among tenants. Many of the stores serve the city's poorest neighborhoods. They are marginal businesses. The tenants in urban renewal areas may well feel that low rent is a reasonable price for the uncertainty of their occupancy. The nonprofits feel they are providing a community service on a shoestring.
But it is hard to justify the inequities of the current system. In one case on the Bowery, officials said, a restaurant equipment store pays the city $177 a month in rent for a space that has a current appraised value of $1,900.
On Thompson Street in Soho, a long-operating hair salon in a five-story walk-up pays $350 a month. Its neighbor, a recently arrived art gallery, pays the city $1,330 for a store the same size. A private owner's asking rent for a vacant store in the next-door building is $1,500.
"Obviously it would be more difficult for me than it is now," said Romeo DaSilva, the owner of the hair salon, Girl Loves Boy, which has been at 63 Thompson Street for 13 years with no rent increase.
"Would it put me out of business?" he said. "Who knows? A little rent increase I can see." Rent levels aside, the commercial tenants are hardly a privileged lot. Their businesses lack the assurance of a long-term lease and stable long-term occupancy. Their leases run only 11 months. If they were a year or more each lease would have to go through the uniform land-use review process.
Since they are in buildings headed for reuse, resale or perhaps demolition, the tenants are unable to make a long-term investment in them. The city provides basic services only.
These factors will be considered in the appraisals that set the fair-market rents, said Deputy Housing Commissioner William E. Spiller, who heads the Office of Property Management.
The rent restructuring plan sets up three categories of commercial tenants: those in space under 1,000 square feet; those in more than 1,000 square feet, and those leased to nonprofit tenants.
In the first category -- usually small grocers or other retailers -- rents would rise to their fair-market appraised value at a rate no faster than 15 percent a year over five years. In the final year, if the fair-market level had not already been reached, the rent would rise as much as necessary for that to happen.
For these stores, the minimum first-year rent would be $300, assuming that the fair-market rent is higher than that. If it is lower, the rent would go to that level in the first year.
For commercial spaces of more than 1,000 square feet there would also be a 15 percent cap, but the minimum first-year rent would be set at 25 percent of the appraised fair-market rent.
Nonprofits would pay a minimum of $150 a month in the first year (or the fair-market rent if that is lower). Their phase-in schedule is 10 percent of the previous year's rent in the second through fourth years, and 15 percent a year thereafter until the target rent of 50 percent of fair-market value is reached.
There are about 200 nonprofit tenants in these city-owned stores, Mr. Spiller said. The new policy would make it likely that they would have to be able to afford at least $150 a month in rent.
The five-year phase-in is intended to give tenants whose rents are far removed from market rents and who find market rents unaffordable time to move to another location. In the case of the Soho hair salon, for example, the rent would go from $350 a month in the first year to $403 in the second; $532 in the third; $612 in the fourth, and $1,330 in the fifth.
Commissioner Spiller estimated that 800 tenants would be affected by the restructuring. An important aspect of the plan is its intention to set appraisals that realistically take account of building and leasing conditions, he said. The auctions of the last three years have produced 600 storefront leases, he said. The upset price was set at 75 percent of the appraised value.
"The bids validated our appraisal methods," Commissioner Spiller said. "In almost all cases we received bids above the upset prices."

Helping Transferees Who Rent

BYLINE: By ANDREE BROOKS

 BODY:
A growing number of corporate transferees are choosing to rent rather than buy a home at their new assignment, a situation that is creating new challenges for the transferees and their employers.
 "For the first time I am hearing about people getting benefits that were never discussed before," said Priscilla Toomey, senior vice president at Prudential Relocation Management in White Plains, which handles the housing needs of corporate transferees. Demand for help with rental relocation among Prudential's 400 corporate clients rose by 25 percent in the last two years, she said. In the past, the company had provided help mainly in buying and selling homes. 
 Greg Brewer, editor of the Runzheimer Reports on Relocation, a monthly trade newsletter, reports a similar shift. He attributes it to lingering uncertainties in the real estate market combined with personal fears about the future. Another factor, other experts say, is that corporations squeezed by the recession are eager to trim costs, and rental benefits are cheaper than those for homeowners.
 Also, a growing number of transferees no longer expect to make a profit on the sale of their homes. Thus they do not have to worry about the capital-gains tax that might be due on the profits of the sale if they did not replace it with the purchase of another primary residence within two years.
 Adding to the appeal of renting for transferees, brokers say, has been the increased availability of attractive properties at favorable rents -- a consequence of a lack of buyers for these properties.
 It was just this combination of factors that led Michael Waltz, an assistant vice president at Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association, to decide to rent when he learned he was being transferred from Chicago to New York City in May. "I wasn't going to make more than a normal profit on my condo in Chicago," he said, "and I was even less optimistic about the New York market."
 However, since most relocation-benefit programs are still heavily weighted toward buying and selling, employees interested in renting could miss out unless they play their cards carefully.
 For example, Chevron Corporation still provides up to $60,000 toward the cost of purchasing a home for someone being moved from a relatively low-priced area like Houston to a high-priced region like San Francisco, said David Barlow, the company's manager of human-resources policy.
By contrast, until about 18 months ago renters were able to get only the blanket bonus of six weeks' pay available to all transferred employees and a small additional allowance based on the gap between prevailing shelter costs in the two cities.
 Chevron has since made some adjustments -- renters can now get $5,000 up front and $10,000 over the following two years for a similar Houston-to-San Francisco move. But dozens of other companies have yet to formally offer much in the way of rental help for domestic transferees (most rental programs were devised for employees being temporarily sent overseas). As a result, rental transferees may need to speak up to get equal treatment.
"Although more companies are providing better benefits to renters, it's mostly being done on a individual basis," Ms. Toomey said.
 Among the possible benefits are reimbursement for the cost of placing the former home under professional property management and for difference between that home's monthly mortgage payments and the rent obtained for it; a home-finding trip to the new location; and reimbusement of any lease-cancellation charge at the new location if the transferee has to relocate again during the term of a lease.
Reimbursement of up-front rental costs is important, since those costs can add up quickly, said Marion Usdan, corporate relocation coordinator for Weichert Relocation Company of New Jersey. For instance, a one- or two-month security deposit, the first month's rent in advance, an agent's fee of a month's rent, and the cost of fuel and cleaning services could create a total cash advance of $6,500 on a $1,500-a-month rental.
 The experts say employees should also ask in advance about a "delayed trigger" on benefits. This could be important for a transferee who elects not to sell an existing home right away, since it may involve taking a loss, but intends to become a renter in the new location only until economic conditions improve.
The delayed trigger gives an employee a later opportunity to tap into sale-and-purchase reimbursement benefits traditionally available only at the time of the move -- not six months or a year later.
 One way to persuade a company to provide rental benefits is to demonstrate the compar ative savings. The latest Runzheimer survey, for example, showed that it cost $35,080 on average to relocate a homeowning employee in 1990, up from $30,760 in 1988. By contrast, relocating a renter cost a company less than a third of that amount -- $9,329 on average in 1990, only a marginal increase from the 1988 cost of $9,218.
 Linda Kabelis, who works for PHH Homequity in Rahway, N.J., recently moved from Norwalk, Conn. Before even presenting to her employer her "wish list" of benefits as a renter, she found out exactly what the costs would be. And although she did not get all she wanted, "they covered quite a lot," she said.
 It may also be helpful to demonstrate to an employer how additional savings might be achieved if certain blanket benefits available to all transferees were modified to meet the renter's needs. John Griffin, president of Griffin Realty Group of Manhattan, which specializes in rentals for corporate transferees, tells of an executive for a Midwest pharmaceutical company who found a superb two-bedoom apartment on the Upper East Side for only $1,500 a month -- something of a bargain -- on the very first day he went out looking.
 The difficulty was that the landlord required him to start paying rent immediately to reserve the apartment, even though the transfer would not take place for two months. Though the Midwest corporation had no formal policy anticipating this type of cost, the executive managed to persuade his company to cover the two months' rent by pointing out that it would not have to pay hotel costs for him and his family for their first 60 days in the city, a benefit it offered to all transferees. The hotel bill, he said, could have been $6,000 -- twice the cost of two months' rent.

Danbury Begins a Downtown Renewal

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES

 BODY:
AFTER three decades of planning, and some false starts, Danbury has begun to revitalize its neglected downtown.
With 25 percent of retail space and 20 percent of downtown offices vacant, building a large municipal garage might seem to be the last thing Danbury needs, but a 550-car structure is now going up -- and there is method in the seeming madness. 
 "We have around 400 cars parked in a patchwork of temporary surface lots in the Redevelopment District off Main Street," said Dennis Elpern, the city's planner. "Those sites are slated for the building of new stores, restaurants, housing and offices. We have to replace the parking so that developers can come in and work."
And there is lots of work to do in a downtown scarred by two floods -- the Still River flood of 1955 that destroyed the seven acres that now make up the Redevelopment District, and the flood of development in the 1980's along Interstate 84 and Route 7 that created a flourishing second city on Danbury's outskirts at the center's expense.
Proposals for developing three of nine sites that make up the 7.7-acre Redevelopment District were given preliminary approval by the city's Redevelopment Agency on June 12. The plans would add a total of some 20,000 square feet of retail space, 10,000 square feet of offices, 165 restaurant seats, 81 units of housing and a 1,000-seat triplex movie theater. The downtown area's current inventory includes one theater, 373,000 square feet of retail space, 400,000 square feet of offices and more than a dozen restaurants.
The focal point, said Mr. Elpern, will be a 19,580-square-foot plot of greenery off Main Street that the city will landscape and beautify at a cost of $250,000 in state funds and call, appropriately, the Green.
York Associates of Manhattan has made a $5.27 million proposal to build a triplex movie theater, 46 town-house condominiums and 9,500 square feet of restaurant and retail space on a foundation installed in 1987 by a Waterbury developer, John Erichetti, who was unable to continue because of financial difficulties.
"We are not looking for one magic developer any more," said Mayor Gene F. Eriquez. "We now have smaller sites and a mix of developers."
Proposals by Davon Development Corporation and City Center Development Partnership, two local firms, were selected for the other two sites.
Davon's $5.15 million Liberty Terrace proposal comprises 5,350 square feet of retail space and 35 condominium units. City Center proposes 10,320 square feet of retail space, 9,750 square feet of offices and a restaurant at a cost of $2 million. Its project would be called Pavilion on the Green.
Each developer has a negotiable checklist of preconditions to meet, said John J. Sullivan, chairman of the Redevelopment Agency. For example, the agency would require York Associates to pay $200,000 for pedestrian improvements and $1.6 million in lieu of parking. York is committed to beginning construction next year.
"Their plan does not contain enough parking," said Mr. Sullivan, "and since they are getting the land and foundation free, they will have to fund parking elsewhere, or reduce the dollar amount by providing more on-site parking."
The 175,000-square-foot municipal garage, under construction by Desman Associates of Manhattan, will face Delay Street; pedestrians will be able to reach it from Main Street along two brick-paved, landscaped walks. The garage will also contain the city's Parking Authority offices.
None of the plans for the Redevelopment District or Main Street call for city money. The $4.3 million garage will be financed through an $8 million state grant, the rest of which will used for paving the sidewalks with brick along a half-mile retail core of Main Street, and for benches, trees and a new system of synchronized traffic signals to be installed down the entire two-mile length of Main Street beginning in August.
Felice Plain, executive director of City Center Danbury, a group of 120 downtown property owners working with the city and the Redevelopment Agency, said: "We have just completed a retail cluster plan for Main Street, something different from strip centers and the mall."
"Office supplies, office furniture, printers, dry cleaners and other services," she said, "would be clustered from Rose to White Street; entertainment and specialty retail from White to Liberty Street; decorative arts, antiques, furniture and galleries from Liberty to Boughton."
As new stores arrive, they will be clustered in the designated areas but old stores will not be forced out.
Financed by member assessments of $2 to $20,000, depending on the size of property and range of business, the organization's $150,000 budget covers staffing, marketing, planning, security and maintenance.
Figures compiled by the Greater Danbury Chamber of Commerce for its 10-town area show 3 million square feet of offices and an equal amount of retail space. "Between 80 and 85 percent of that is located in Danbury," said Joseph Wrinn, a realty broker with the local firm of Goodfellow Ashmore.
 Another boost for downtown is due in 1993 when a new train station is built by the State Department of Transportation at Liberty Street and Patriot Drive, just south of the old station and the Redevelopment District.
Richard P. Rathbun, director of rail operations for the New Haven division of the Metro-North Commuter Railroad, said that "we are swapping the old station and parking area for 2.6 acres of city land at the new site; the city can then develop the old station commercially." The old station is on the National Register of Historic Places.
The new, 1,800-square-foot depot will have a ticket booth, waiting room and rest rooms, and an expandable parking lot of 150 spaces.
Of immediate concern to downtown boosters is financing the redevelopment projects in the midst of a recession. "We are confident that we can deliver backers," said Thomas Wormser, a partner at York Associates. "There is interest from movie operators and retailers for preleasing, and at around $115,000 a unit we feel that we can presell the condominiums."
"All the developers are moving forward with their plans and considering our stipulations," said Mr. Sullivan. "If we get two out of three it will be marvelous."

Rent Overcharge
 
Question: I am the prime tenant of a rent-stabilized apartment. I came to the conclusion I was being overcharged on my rent and filed a complaint with the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal in June 1990. I have received a docket number but have heard nothing since then. Is there any way to establish when a complaint will become an active investigation and how long it will take to settle the matter? . . . Lise Holst, Manhattan 

 Answer: No. Thomas R. Viola, a spokesman for the state housing agency, said that the average waiting time between receipt of such a complaint and an investigation is about 27 months. He ascribed the delay to the number of complaints -- currently about 18,000 cases in New York City.
"Once a case is moved to an investigator," said Mr. Viola, "determination ususally comes in three months. But until then the time is spent in a queue waiting for attention."
Several variables affect how long the investigation can take, Mr. Viola said, including how much cooperation the agency gets from landlords. Determining if a tenant has been charged too much requires a rent history for the apartment and that often requires that the owner provides copies of past leases.
 
Rules for Window Guards
 
Question: I live in a four-story, 40-unit co-op. I want to know if window guards are required on the first floors as well as upper floors and in all windows in apartments where children live, and who is responsible for installing them. Where can we go for that information? . . . Thomas P. Herbert, Brooklyn.
 
Answer: Go to the Department of Health's Window Falls Prevention Program. A spokesman for the department said that Section 131.15 of the city's health code require guards on all windows, including those on the first floor, in units where children 10 years old or younger live. The exceptions are windows used as emergency exits, like those leading to fire escapes.
The owner, lessee or manager of a multiple dwelling is responsible for installing the guards, but it is up to the tenant to notify the owner or board of directors if there is a child in the apartment. Some owners or co-op boards pass along the cost of the guards to tenants; others absorb the expense.
For further information call the Window Falls Prevention Program at 566-8082.
 
Two-Family Homes
 
Question: My husband and I are confused about what "legal two-family house" means. Is there a reference we can use to ensure that if we buy a two-family home it is legal? . . . Charleen Lang, Maspeth, Queens
 
Answer: Yes. The City's Department of Buildings can tell you whether a house is a legal two-family dwelling. One criterion is the number of units listed in the house's Certificate of Occupancy. If, for example, a home has two living spaces but its certificate indicates it is a single dwelling, the second apartment is illegal.
Sometimes owners of large houses add an apartment in the basement or the top floor. When such changes are made, the owner not only needs Buildings Department permits to do the work, but also must have the certificate changed to legalize the added unit.
Information on the status of dwellings in Queens is available in the Buildings Department's borough office, 126-06 Queens Boulevard, Kew Gardens. The telephone number is 718-520-3402.

HEADLINE: DINING OUT;
In Cromwell, Thai Food to Tease the Palate

BYLINE: By PATRICIA BROOKS

 BODY:
FOR a while, Thai restaurants were popping up throughout Connecticut. Now, after a recession-induced slowdown, there is a new one, Thai Gardens, in the town of Cromwell, near Middletown.
It is a welcome addition, both for its attractive and spacious dining room (including tables and floor cushions for Thai-style seating) in a small shopping center and, more important, for the authentic taste of the dishes on its sizable menu. 
 On arrival, we felt a tinge of apprehension. As aficionados of Thai food, it has been our experience outside Connecticut that some restaurants labeled as Thai are really Chinese. We weren't reassured when our waitress, who looked Thai, asked us to specify by numbers the Thai dishes we had ordered by their Thai names (it was probably our Western pronounciation) and then asked if we wanted the dishes mild or hot. We said "almost Thai hot" -- and to our pleasure that's the way they were served.
After several visits we concluded that Thai Gardens is truly a garden of Thai delights. If the menu lacks certain Thai specialties that might be favorites of yours, there are enough well-prepared dishes with sufficient variety to take up the slack.
For a newcomer to the intense spiciness of Thai cuisine, one might begin with a mildly seasoned satay of skewered and grilled pork, beef or chicken. We selected chicken, and the skewers of grilled white meat were served with a tiny hibachi for keeping the skewers warm and with two dipping sauces: peanut and a cucumber vinegar sauce with a sharp edge.
An even better starter choice was hot-hot pork (nam sod) -- a pungent salad of cooked ground pork, tossed with scallions, peanuts, red peppers and the snap of ginger and lime juice, served on a bed of lettuce. Jumping squid consisted of grilled squid, chopped purple onions, cucumber and tomatoes, with chili paste, lemon grass, hot peppers and lime juice -- a spectrum of competing flavors. The same dish made with shrimp was equally tingling.
Other starters of merit were tofu tod (deep-fried bean curd with a well-seasoned peanut sauce), mee grob (crispy rice noodles mixed with shrimp and vegetables in a honey sauce -- too sweet for some tastes), and clear noodles (glass noodles entwined with jumbo shrimp, bits of Chinese sausage, ground pork, red and green peppers, tomatoes and straw mushrooms).
A good Thai soup often shows off the complexity and balance inherent in this delicate yet spicy cuisine. At Thai Gardens, two satisfying soups were shrimp soup (full of shrimp and straw mushrooms as well as a well-balanced spice-sour interplay and a lemon grass accent) and chicken soup (pieces of white meat in a lightly spiced coconut milk broth with a ginger-like galanga root undercurrent).
An entree standout was basil duck -- small, crisp-skinned wedges, crunchy with the contrasting flavor and textures of fresh basil, bell peppers and onion slices. Also engaging (and moderately combustible) was chicken curry, a red curry with bamboo shoots and a thin coconut milk broth (tasty when spooned over rice); a similarly prepared shrimp curry was also zesty.
Hot and sour fish was another pleasure: a whole red snapper, deep-fried crisp, with firm, sweet white meat made even more delicious by a tantalizing sauce and an abundance of julienne vegetables. Garlic squid (stir-fried and peppery) was acceptable, too, but several pork dishes -- ginger pork and garlic pork -- were bland and lackluster.
Desserts at Thai Gardens are few, but pumpkin custard and coconut ice cream made cool, refreshing counterpoints to savory meals.
For $41.80 (before tax, tip and drinks), two of us enjoyed three courses apiece. But portions were generous enough so that a single appetizer, especially the Thai salads or noodle dishes, could be shared. The best accompaniment for a Thai meal is Singha beer, though other drinks are also available.
The restaurant's main weakness during our visits was service, which was cheerful but seemed slow and sloppy at times, with drink orders not taken and requests for water forgotten even when repeated. Clearly, these are reparable flaws that shouldn't keep guests from an enjoyable evening.

HEADLINE: Men's Undershirts: Out From Under, Into the Sunshine of Prints and Colors

BYLINE: By DEBORAH HOFMANN

 BODY:
Not long ago, a man could rely on being banished from his own dinner table if he was not wearing a shirt over his undershirt. These days men are wearing jackets over undershirts, instead of shirts, even to fancy restaurants. And sometimes undershirts are being marched right into the office, especially on getaway Fridays.
"This is a street fashion that caught on for its comfort and ease of care," said Chip Tolbert, a spokesman for the Men's Fashion Association, a trade group. He was at his desk wearing a white T-shirt under his suit jacket. He says that the man who wears a T-shirt to work is the same man who might wear a shirt buttoned to the neck but without a tie or, in winter, a turtleneck. 
 When asked their reasons for wearing undershirts instead of shirts, practical men echo Mr. Tolbert. They complain that it costs too much -- about $2.50 -- to have a cotton shirt professionally laundered after each wearing. A T-shirt can be tossed into the washing machine. Many such men say they buy T-shirts made by Jockey International. That traditional undershirt now comes in 12 brilliant colors, plus black, for $9 each. A beefier "sportswear" style, comes in 15 colors as well as 5 prints in several color combinations; it's $12 at Macy's, Bloomingdale's, A & S and Lord & Taylor.
For the man driven more by fashion than by economics, a variety of colors, prints and luxury fabrics can cost him, say, $90 for a designer T-shirt.
"This is the golden anniversary of the T, the peak of a cycle that began 50 years ago when American civilians were introduced to it as part of the Navy uniform in World War II, 1941," said Jack Herschlag, executive director of the National Association of Men's Sportswear Buyers.
From that point, the T-shirt evolved into active wear, generally in a gray hue, with more colorful printed ones for sports teams. These were soon brightened with dramatic graphics. The utilitarian became fashionable. Soon came the message T-shirt, for conveying ideology or advertising. Novelty characters followed, and photo-print likenesses of celebrities like Bo Jackson.
And now there is the "dress" T shirt. "In two years the dress T-shirt went from nothing to being a marketing monster," said Mr. Herschlag in an interview this week at the trade show sponsored by his group at the Javits Convention Center.
Of the 700 companies that displayed there, more than 100 showed dress T-shirts in every shade, as well as in tiny, neat repeat prints, many with detailing on the chest or pocket. Typically, the crew neckband is a little higher, to conceal the collarbone a bit and to prevent a jacket lapel from chafing the neck -- "grace notes," Mr. Herschlag said, "so that there's no mistaking that this is not a makeshift look."
Sales of men's knit shirts -- which include T, polo and turtleneck styles -- have taken off. Retail sales in 1990 were up by 10.4 percent over 1989, reaching more than $3.1 billion, said Peter Simon, a director of the NPD Group, a market research organization in Port Washington, N.Y., which compiles statistics on apparel.
"In the context of the total men's wear business -- which had no growth over the same period -- knit shirts, driven by T's, buck the trend. It's one of the few growth categories," Mr. Simon said. The same rate of increase has continued this year. T-shirts outsell all other mens' tops, including shirts, Mr. Simon said.
Members Only makes cotton T-shirts in 10 folkloric, mosaic and batik-inspired prints, each in at least three color combinations; $20 at A & S and Stern's stores. Sun-bleached earth tones are popular.
Those who favor bright hues lean toward Colours by Alexander Julian, which makes a basic one-pocket T of soft pima cotton in 30 relatively brilliant colors, like iris, orange, teal, midnight, tomato, banana and black; they also have side vents and a back yoke; $26 at Lord & Taylor, Strawbridge & Clothier and Woodward & Lothrop stores.
At Barneys New York, the knit cotton T's of the fashion designer Ronaldus Shamask come in ivory and pewter, and are $90. And Giorgio Armani's luxury T-shirt knit of rust-color viscose is $345. Cotton knit T-shirts by Comme des Garcons, in purple or mustard, are $53. Barneys' private label woven cotton T's in navy, pumpkin, ivory and goldenrod are $28; beefier weights are $40.
Mondo di Marco makes 15 vivid, patterned T-shirts in cotton, drapey rayon, silk or viscose, each pattern available in five color combinations. A Florentine paisley style has been selling very well, especially in warm oranges, cool blues or muted mauve and black; at Bloomingdale's, Saks and I. Magnin nationwide, and at Beau Brummel stores in Manhattan and Queens, it is $80.
Falke makes distressed cotton T-shirts in six prints. The key colors are olive, gray and indigo. Nature themes, geometrics and Aztec symbols play on background colors of olive, gray, white or denim. A popular print depicts a brilliant yellow and fuchsia toucan in an indigo sky. Falke T's are $70 and are still plentiful at Vincci, 7039 Austin Street in Forest Hills, Queens; Aldo's, 725 River Road in Edgewater, N.J., and Tuesday's in Hartford.

Camella Ehlke, Clothing Designer

 BODY:
At 555 Soul, a small Lower East Side store, young people are creating fashions and accessories that reflect downtown night life.
The store, at 151 Ludlow Street, near Houston Street, offers the work of artists, designers and musicians of various racial, ethnic, social and economic backgrounds. They borrow from African, California surf, urban rap and 60's psychedelic styles. 
 They like to gather where their styles are welcome, at "outlaw" clubs, usually in lofts, old theaters or dance studios. The clubs change their locations constantly.
555 Soul's love beads have been worn by the rap artists Jungle Brothers and Boogie Down Productions.
Camella Ehlke, who runs 555 Soul, makes clothing based on designs, patterns and colors of the last four decades. Her work evokes the 60's, but, she said, "This is definitely a 90's thing."
Miss Ehlke, 21 years old, barters her clothing for jewelry made by her colleagues. Her clothes (shirts and slacks are $40 to $55) combine stripes with patterns, and then she adds a touch of street style. She says she plans to use local grafitti artists to create fabric designs. Her hats ($25) dominate one wall. Brightly colored and oddly shaped, they call to mind cartoon characters like Jughead or the Cat in the Hat.
555 Soul's jewelry, most of it love beads inspired by African trading beads (necklaces are sold at $5 a bead), includes medallions ($50 and up) made by two teams of artists. Jamalsky and Cormack, who each use only one name, produce their work as Level Vibe Productions; Sung Choi and Melissa Odegaard collaborate as Ofe Intl.
The store's hours are 1 P.M. to 7 P.M. Tuesdays through Sundays. Call (212) 995-9252.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
It's a Merrily Asynchronous World We Have

BYLINE: By Sylvia Nasar

 BODY:
Last week seemed to prove that the world's stock markets are as tightly intertwined as the circuitry on a computer chip. Shocks from far-flung markets -- a potential cease-fire violation in Baghdad, a tax hike in Bonn, a financial scandal in Tokyo -- helped knock the Dow, which closed at 2906.75, down by 58.81 points for the week. But don't jump to the conclusion that the world's stock markets will keep marching in lockstep.
True, investors all over the globe are becoming decidedly less provincial. Every day more than $600 billion sloshes around the world's currency markets. Foreigners tripled their holdings of American stocks during the 1980's. American stockholders, meanwhile, quintupled their ownership of foreign shares. 
 If anything, the trends that encouraged such worldliness on the part of investors continue apace, said David G. Strongin, director of international finance at the Securities Industries Association. Governments keep lifting capital controls and technology keeps making it easier to track and trade shares wherever they are.
Nonetheless, there's little evidence that stock markets are more in sync today than they were back in the isolationist 1950's and 1960's. A Morgan Stanley study of how closely stock markets move together shows that the tendency for lockstep movement is no greater now than 20 years ago. "You'd expect the correlations to get tighter," said Madhav Dhar, global equities strategist for Morgan Stanley. "But while the world is getting to be a smaller place in terms of throwing money around, other factors are making it more diverse."
For one thing, said Mr. Dhar, the United States is no longer the world economy's sole trend setter. Its share of global stock market capitalization has shrunk dramatically. For another, ownership of stocks and bonds is still overwhelmingly national. That means prospects at home -- namely, domestic interest rates and profits -- still matter the most.
Most important, though, is the happily asynchronous state of the world's economies. Nowadays, the United States and Canada are coming out of recessions, Mexico is booming, while Germany and Japan are slowing from their recent torrid pace. A few decades ago, the world mostly boomed and slumped together.
Some events still have the power to roil all the worlds' markets at once, like the global spurt in interest rates before the 1987 crash, the collapse of Communism, or last year's surge in oil prices. But even then, markets hardly reacted alike.
During 1987 as a whole, for example, Japan's market rose 9 percent, West Germany's plunged 38 percent and in the United States, things ended up where it started. Last year, after the Berlin wall crumbled and worldwide interest rates soared, Japan's market plummeted and Germany's zoomed.
As for the future, said P. Craig Ueland, director of international consulting at the Frank-Russell Company, "One might expect a greater tendency for markets to move together. At best, the conventional wisdom that they already do so is ahead of reality."

The Cable and Wireless Conundrum

BYLINE: BY Jonathan Fuerbringer

 BODY:
Cable and Wireless P.L.C., the British-based telecommunications company with a presence in 50 countries, pleased investors earlier this month when it reported pretax profits up 15.5 percent for the fiscal year ended March 31. And this in a recession year.
Moreover, more than 60 percent of the company's revenues are dollar based, so the strong rally of the dollar in the last five months sent analysts back to their calculators to raise their earnings forecasts for the current fiscal year. Although its headquarters are in London, the company's heart is Hong Kong where the currency is tied to the dollar. Cable and Wireless has a 58.4 percent controlling stake in Hong Kong Telecommunications, which provided 43 percent of the company's revenue and 59 percent of its profit last year. 
 Company officials, including its group managing director, Gordon M. W. Owen, and finance director, Rodney J. Olsen, crowed about these numbers on a recent visit to New York City. They waxed enthusiastic about the company's global digital "highway," including an American link with US Sprint. The highway is a fiber-optic cable system linking major financial centers and offering business customers such things as high-definition television and video-conferencing, high-speed data transmission and faxes. Cable and Wireless also owns Mercury Communications, the first and only competitor to British Telecommunications, the Government-owned phone company.
Despite its good looks last year and prospects in the current year, there are questions about Cable and Wireless which, at current prices, make the stock less attractive.
The stock's volatility reflects some of this uncertainty. In June alone, its price fell to 490 pence ($9.08 at Friday's exchange rate) and then rallied to 560. It closed Friday at 529. The company's American Depository Receipt which trades in New York has moved from a low of 24.875 to 26.875. It closed Friday at 25.50.
The stock already trades at a 13-to-20 percent premium to the British market as a whole, based on earnings projections.
Then there are the questions about the quality of Cable and Wireless' earnings. The company has had a good stream of average earnings over the last decade, but the yearly numbers are subject to big hits from exchange rate moves. Last year, for example, the company estimated that pretax profits would have doubled to 31 percent if the dollar had not been so weak. Now the high hopes for the current fiscal year are based on the current strong dollar retaining its strength.
Some of the pretax profit last year was based on special factors that should vanish this year. One was the sale of a managing director's house in Hong Kong that added 9.2 million pounds ($16 million) to the books.
In addition, the sale of 20 percent of Cable and Wireless' stake in Hong Kong Telecommunicatons to the Chinese Government reduced the company's borrowing needs in 1991, dropping the bank loan level from 59.9 million pounds ($104.2 million at the end-of-March exchange rate) in 1990 to 16.3 million pounds in fiscal 1991. Company executives acknowledge that borrowing will pick up again this year.
Such things accounted for a swing in the company's net-interest and other-income line from a 46.9 million pound deficit in 1990 to a 31.2 million pound surplus the following year. The 78.1 million pound shift accounts for all but 3.7 million pounds of the increase in profits before taxes.
All of these considerations must be weighed against larger questions about the future of Hong Kong, which reverts to the control of China in 1997. Hong Kong Telecommunications is not only Cable and Wireless' main business but also a source of money needed to expand Mercury back home in the United Kingdom, enhance the global digital highway and eventually make the company much less dependent on Hong Kong.
Cable and Wireless, as well as analysts like Robert B. Morris 3d of Goldman Sachs in San Francisco, are not worried about the takeover by China. Mr. Morris is more concerned, at least in the near term, about how a tax increase in Hong Kong will eat into Hong Kong Telecom's earnings this year.
"The investment program we have in Hong Kong would not be going on there unless we had confidence," said Mr. Owen, the group managing director for Cable and Wireless. But Hong Kong's future will still hang over the company and the stock for some time.
Finally, there is the fallout from recent government decisions about how the British telecommunications industry should be regulated. Analysts have generally concluded that the new regulatory approach gives breaks to both Cable and Wireless and British Telecommunications. But how they sort out to the bottom line in the next few years is still being debated.
Negative interpretations, like that of Partick Wellington of County Natwest Securities in London, emphasize that new costs Cable and Wireless could incur for access to the B.T. network and the price restructuring that will enable B.T. to lower prices to business customers could hurt the company. Postive views, like that of Michael Armitage of Morgan Stanley & Company in London, conclude that what is good for B.T. is good for Cable and Wireless.

HEADLINE: Making a Difference;
A Bank With Roots Deep in the South

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE

 BODY:
When John G. Medlin Jr., chairman of the Wachovia Corporation, boasts of making money the old-fashioned way, he means it. One of the South's most venerable banks, it is also one of the nation's most profitable, because of a conservative strategy of prudent lending and rational growth.
In keeping with that strategy, Wachovia announced last week that it was acquiring the South Carolina National Corporation in a $835 million stock swap. This will give Wachovia, which has operations in Georgia and North Carolina, a new base in South Carolina and a strong presence throughout the Southeast. The combined company will be the nation's 18th largest bank, with assets of nearly $33 billion. 
 "The states of South Carolina, North Carolina and Georgia represent the economic and geographic heartland of the Southeast," said Mr. Medlin, who is 57 years old. "They've got a very solid anchor and that gives us financial strength and business diversity unsurpassed by any other banking company in the Southeast."
Like Mr. Medlin, a native North Carolinian who has spent his entire career at Wachovia, the bank franchise that he built has its roots deep in Southern soil. In 1985, a few months after interstate banking was permitted, Wachovia (pronounced WALK-ova-ya) acquired First National Bank of Atlanta, which like Wachovia was founded during the Reconstruction. South Carolina National, founded in 1834, predates the Civil War and survived Sherman's advance by moving its gold reserves around from Columbia to Charleston to Greenville.
Wachovia, the nation's 12th most profitable bank, avoided the lending spree of the 1980's by making conservative loans close to home. Nearly 40 percent of its assets are consumer loans. Of the 60 percent that are commercial loans, only about a quarter are to borrowers outside Georgia and North Carolina.
Real estate loans, which are causing so much trouble at other banks, represent only 15 percent of Wachovia's portfolio.
"Wachovia is well rooted in what it does and doesn't get caught up in fads," said Henry Coffey, an analyst with J. C. Bradford in Nashville. "They walk the middle ground. It's part of a very old culture."
Mr. Medlin is not worried about the possiblity of a merger between Wachovia's leading North Carolina rival, the NCNB Corporation, and the C&S/ Sovran Financial Corporation -- even though such a union would create the second-largest banking company in the United States.
"We'll stick to our own more patient gradual strategy," he said. "Besides, we're still plenty big to be competitive against banks of all sizes."

Congress Finds It's Easier to Criticize on Savings and Loan Bailout 

Last week, when Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady asked Congress for $80 billion more for the savings and loan bailout, he couldn't have played to a worse crowd. First he was criticized about Administration estimates of the bailout's cost. Too optimistic, Congress said. Then he was accused of playing politics with the taxpayers money. And when he made a proposal of his own -- to remove the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation from day-to-day management of the bailout -- Congress was receptive, but only so-so. "Members of Congress are starting to feel some heat over the bailout," said Norman Ornstein, an analyst at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington. "Though Brady is not disliked, he isn't generating any deep respect." While Congress may be feeling heat, no members have taken the risk of devising their own plan. "Congress is still trying to roil the waters. It wants to focus attention on what's gone wrong," he said.
 
Honda, North of the Border
 
The Honda Motor Company builds some of America's best-selling cars in Canada. The trouble is, says the Customs Service, Honda might not be building enough of each car there to qualify for duty-free status. One car in particular is a problem -- the Civic. For it to escape a 2.5 percent tariff, at least 50 percent of its parts must be made in the United States or Canada. The Customs Service contends that Japan supplies more than half of the Civic's parts. Honda may owe as much as $20 million in back payments. Not so, says Honda. The company has dispatched its lawyers to Washington, parts invoices in hand. Now Congress has jumped into the dispute. Some members are asking for tougher "rules of origin" in the negotiations over with Mexico over a free-trade pact.
 
Making It Easier for TV Stations
 
If you think tough times for broadcast television are already here, you haven't seen anything yet. That was the message released last week in a report from the Federal Communications Commission. The F.C.C. predicts cable and other forms of pay TV will leave broadcast stations with a smaller, poorer, less desirable market. The networks -- which had 93 percent of prime-time viewers in 1975 and only 64 percent now -- will fare the worst. Commission Chairman Alfred C. Sikes is likely to use the report to try to relax rules governing how many broadcast stations a company can own. The cable owners did not like what they heard. They fear consolidation among the broadcast channels.
 
 The Slowest Recovery
 
The economy ran in reverse in the first quarter of the year. The gross national product contracted by a sharp 2.8 percent, according to the Commerce Department. That was worse than most economists expected. That all but defuses the short and shallow theory. Short perhaps, but probably not shallow. And corporate profits also took a tumble -- down 6.3 percent. "We hit bottom in April," said Ed Yardeni, chief economist at C. J. Lawrence in New York. "And this will be one of the slowest recoveries on record." Why so slow? "The labor force is not growing; neither is productivity," he said. "Demographically there are not as many yuppies. And Americans bought 100 million cars in the 1980's."
 
Optimistic Indicators
 
The hope is that the nation's leading economic indicators really do point the way. According to the Commerce Department, the indicators rose by 0.8 percent in May, the fourth advance in a row. The indicators forecast economic events six to nine months in advance. "But the numbers still don't tell us the shape of the recovery," said Mickey D. Levy, chief economist at CRT Government Securities.
 
Unimpressed Markets
 
Orders for durable goods moved up a sprightly 3.8 percent in May. That was the second consecutive monthly gain and the biggest jump in more than a year, the Commerce Department said last week. So why weren't the markets smiling? "The figures say the upturn that has now started will be very slow," said Lawrence Chimerine, senior adviser to DRI Inc., an economic advising firm. "And some industries, like computers and machine tools, are still doing poorly," he said. Though an upturn is in sight, profits will still take time to recover.
 
Consumers Learn to Spend Again
 
Consumers are spending again. Go get the confetti. Consumer spending -- which accounts for two-thirds of all economic activity -- surged 1.1 percent in May, according to the Commerce Department. These statistics, coming after others that showed further increases in consumer confidence, were enough to get the White House to officially proclaim the end of the recession. "Unless something that we haven't forecast happens, it does look like the recession -- on a national basis -- has ended," said Michael Boskin, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers.

Swiss Stock Up on Jet Fighters
 
Switzerland is ringed with jagged mountains and hasn't fought a war in 200 years. But you never know. So last week the Government's Federal Council said it would recommend purchase of 34 F/A-18 jet fighters to be produced by the McDonnell Douglas Corporation in the United States and in Switzerland. The contract, which is expected to get Parliament's approval, is worth about $2.25 billion. With post-cold war cutbacks affecting every weapons maker, this sale is a very big deal.
 
Welcoming Gorbachev, Sort Of
 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union will be meeting in London next month with the leaders of the world's richest nations -- the G-7. When he does, they will be handing him half an invitation. The Soviet Union can join the International Monetary Fund, they plan to say, but only as an associate. Associate status was dreamed up last week in London when the G-7's finance ministers met. An associate, they explained, is entitled to the fund's advice, but none of its money. To get the money the Soviet Union has to come up with a credible plan for creating a market economy -- something Moscow has been working on since 1985.

Yoshihisa Tabuchi, president and chief executive of the Nomura Securities Company in Tokyo, resigned last week. Nomura is the world's largest securities house. Nomura admitted that it had paid its best customers $120 million to compensate for losses. It also admitted it had provided $100 million in financing to Susumu Ishii, a well-known organized crime figure in Japan. The extent of the scandal, which involves three other firms, has observers wondering if Japan's markets operate by a different set of rules. It also has them wondering about Nomura's culture, which values deal-making above everything else. While Mr. Tabuchi is stepping aside, he is not stepping down. He will become vice chairman.
 
 
 
COMPANIES

 
Gloom at Wells Fargo
 
Wells Fargo & Company, the nation's 10th-largest bank, has 53 percent of its loan portfolio invested in the slumping real estate market -- and that's the good news. Those borrowers continue to pay off their loans. More worrisome are the bank's commercial loans. Wells Fargo has had to put $400 million of those loans on a nonaccrual basis. Wells Fargo is expecting loan losses in the second quarter of $180 million, up from $67 million the quarter before. The bank also announced last week that it would be increasing its loan-loss reserves. The company's stock fell $6.50 to $74 on the news and finished the week at $69.
 
Boeing on a Roll
 
What recession? That must be the question asked most often in the halls of the Boeing Commercial Airplane Company in Seattle. It has 110 aircraft on its order books and last week Lufthansa Leasing Group put in a request for 10 more planes worth $1.5 billion.
 
When Diversification Backfires
 
Glenfed Inc., the parent of the nation's third-largest savings and loan association, thought it had a winning strategy: diversify. So in the mid-1980's the Los Angeles-based savings and loan shifted heavily into real estate and commercial lending. Last week Glenfed said it expects $235 million in losses for the fiscal year, which ends today. The company is adding $255 million to its loan loss reserves. "The question is, Are Glenfed's actions enough and in time, and will California real estate markets cooperate?" said James M. Marks, analyst with SNL Securities in Charlottesville, Va.
 
The Apple, I.B.M. Two-Step
 
They are certainly one of corporate America's odder couples -- Apple and I.B.M. Yet the International Business Machines Corporation and the Apple Computer Company -- the nations two biggest PC makers -- are trying to work through their differences. I.B.M. has a hot new chip -- the RS/6000 -- it would like Apple to use. In return it wants some of Apple's snazzy, easy-to-use software. If the two companies do learn to dance, they may prove to be powerful allies against a consortium of computer companies that includes Microsoft, Digital Equipment and Compaq Computer. The consortium is trying set new software standards. But Apple worries that the RS/ 6000 chip will prove too expensive. And it worries about culture. When 150 buttoned-down I.B.M.-ers descended on laid-back Cupertino, Calif., Apple's managers blanched. The talks are stalled.

Ambition Rules at NCNB
 
You might say Hugh L. McColl Jr., chairman of the NCNB Corporation, is a man with ambition. Ten years ago his little North Carolina National Bank had just $7 billion in assets. Now, if the proposed merger with the C&S/ Sovran Financial Corporation goes through, NCNB will be the second-biggest bank holding company in the country. The deal -- for about $4 billion in stock -- will give NCNB about $116 billion in assets. Its operations would stretch from Baltimore, through much of the South, to Texas. The deal "is potentially a catalytic event for the banking industry," said James J. McDermott Jr., of Keefe, Bruyette Woods Inc., a research firm in New York.

HEADLINE: All About/Commercial Radio;
Too Many Stations, Too Few Buyers and Depressed Prices

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

 BODY:
These are dog days for commercial radio and not just because the recession has hurt advertising. For starters, the radio dial has become far more congested in recent years because the Federal Communications Commission has approved well over a thousand new stations since the early 1980's in efforts to foster competition. The result: more broadcasters chasing the same advertising dollars, sometimes amid increased interference.
How bad are things? Advertising revenues last year were about $8.84 billion, virtually unchanged from the year before, according to the Radio Advertising Bureau, an industry group in New York. And the F.C.C. recently reported that 197 AM stations and 30 FM stations have simply chosen to go off the air, because they could not meet expenses or find anybody to buy their licenses. In the past, analysts say, it has been very rare indeed for stations to "go dark." 
 Even when buyers have been found, they are paying a lot less than they used to. By any measure, the prices commanded for radio properties have been plunging. In 1985, according to Paul Kagan Associates, a market research firm in Carmel, Calif., the average price for a combined AM/FM station was $4 million. In 1987, the price had climbed to $6.2 million amid a flurry of speculative buying. But last year, prices fell to an average of just $1.8 million and they show no signs of recovering.
The number of stations changing hands is also down. Sales have fallen off dramatically, from a high of just under 1,400 transactions in 1986 to a low of less than 1,000 last year. Sales activity for the first half of this year indicates that 1991 is likely to be even slower than last year was.

 
 
The Neathery Solution
Don't Buy a Station, Just Buy Its Airtime
 Robert F. Neathery is a small-business man in West Plains, Mo., population 10,000, where he has owned KWPM-AM and KSPQ-FM for an uneventful 45 years. But last October, Mr. Neathery ushered in a hot new trend in dealmaking.
The practice Mr. Neathery employed is called "time brokering." In these arrangements, a struggling station sells virtually all of its airtime to another station in the same market or in a market next door. The station that sells its time becomes what amounts to a robot transmitter.
Under the deal, Mr. Neathery's AM station obtained rights to almost all the airtime of a more powerful but struggling FM station, KGAR, in nearby Willow Springs. KGAR is owned by Mr. Neathery's grandson, Bret R. Neathery. KGAR now serves as a robot transmitter for KWPM for all but a few hours on Sunday mornings when KGAR broadcasts religious programs.
"Our sponsors love it, because they get more coverage," said the elder Mr. Neathery, adding that KGAR's FM signal holds up far better at night than his own weak AM signal. For its part, KGAR eliminates almost all of its regular operating expenses and receives payment for its airtime.
Given the many stations now in dire financial straits, such deals are beginning to pop up all over the country. "If these stations can't do this, they'll just go off the air," said the elder Mr. Neathery.
But critics contend that the practice threatens diversity, because it effectively guts long-standing Federal rules that bar a single person or company from owning more than one AM and one FM station in the same area.
"What we are starting to see is stations that are not so distressed and not so small taking advantage of these policies," said Andrew Jay Schwartzman, head of the Media Access Project, a public interest group in Washington. "One can easily see a situation where a single entity will be programming and selling advertising to most of the stations, if not every single station, in a medium-sized market."
The trend has also sparked concern on the part of Representative John Dingell, Democrat of Michigan and chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, who has questioned whether time-brokering permits illegal changes in control and whether the F.C.C. is even capable of preventing abuses.
Indeed, F.C.C. officials admit they don't even know how many such deals are in effect because they don't usually find out about them unless a rival station complains. But all agree time-brokering is flourishing.
In staff rulings thus far, the F.C.C. has cleared deals in Miami, Colorado Springs and Victoria, Texas. In addition, officials say they are weighing pacts on Long Island; in Austin, Texas; Nashville, Tenn.; Jackson, Miss., and Huntsville, Ala.

 
 
First Aid for AM
New Rules to Bolster The Hardest Hit
 Plagued by static and other interference, AM radio has been losing market share to the technically superior FM stations for decades. Attempts were made to introduce AM stereo in the late 1970's, but were largely unsuccessful because the industry was deeply divided on which technology to use. As a result, AM stereo never caught on. Today, AM is increasingly the province of talk shows and all-news radio. Music fares best when it is transmitted on the clearer FM signal.
But both the government and the industry are trying to promote a recovery. This fall, the F.C.C. is expected to adopt a host of new rules designed to reduce AM congestion and promote technical quality.
The most noticeable change is likely to be an expansion of the AM band. In an attempt to reduce clutter on the dial, the AM band is expected to be expanded from 1610 kilohertz to 1710. The government is also likely to offer a licensing preference to AM stations that now cause the most interference and would be willing to move to the new band. In moving, however, the AM station would have to meet stricter technical standards to reduce interference.
A second change would allow a station to buy and shut down another station in an adjacent community that is causing interference. Under current rules, station owners who stop broadcasting must turn in their licenses to the government, which then holds it until a buyer appears.
Finally, the National Broadcasting Association has also developed a new AM "super receiver" featuring a new approach to stereo reception. It can also pick up stations in the proposed new band of frequencies.
In addition, officials from the broadcasting association say, the super receiver features circuits for screening out interference from power lines, lights and other sources of electronic "noise." The new receivers are being built by Denon Inc., of Parsippany, N.J., and they are expected to be on the market sometime this year.

 
 
'Reality Checks'
Another Look at Ownership Limits
 Ever since the beginning, of broadcasting, Government rules have limited the number of radio and television stations a single entity can own. Intended to preserve diversity and localism in broadcasting, the rules currently limit an owner to a total of 12 AM stations, 12 FM stations and 12 television stations (one each per market). The rules were relaxed in 1984 from the previous limit of seven AM, FM and television stations.
The F.C.C. is now proposing to further relax the ownership limits, hoping to shore up the beleaguered industry. "In a rapidly changing marketplace, it makes sense to do periodic reality checks," said Alfred C. Sikes, chairman of the F.C.C.
But consumer groups and a number of key Democrats in Congress argue that the move would lead to fewer choices for listeners and harm local programming. Meanwhile, minority broadcasters contend the move would drive up prices of radio properties, making it impossible to "trade up" to bigger stations.
The F.C.C. has asked for comments on an array of new liberal formulas. Among them:
* Raising or eliminating ownership limits for AM stations, but keeping them for FM stations.
* Keeping the total cap on stations, but allowing owners to buy any combination of AM and FM stations.
* Excluding from the limits any stations with very low ratings or stations in markets that have at least 30 separately owned stations.
* Allowing a radio group to exceed a numerical cap on ownership as long as its combined share of the national audience stays below a designated percentage.
But these proposals, suggested in May, have already generated rumblings of opposition from Capitol Hill.
Representative Dingell has suggested that Mr. Sikes was promoting consolidation in the industry.
Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the subcommittee overseeing communications, has made it clear that many lawmakers want to keep the existing rules in place.
But the real question may be different from the one posed by both supporters and critics: Does anyone want to own more stations? At present, no company owns both 12 AM and 12 FM outlets. Only three -- CBS Inc.; Great American Broadcasting Inc. in Cinncinati, Ohio, and Nationwide Communications Inc. in Columbus, Ohio -- have reached the limit of FM stations they can own.
 
 
DIGITAL BROADCASTING AHEAD

For many, there simply is no easy way to deal with digital audio broadcasting. This new technology makes it possible to broadcast music over the airwaves with the clarity of compact disks. Though digital sound is noticeably superior to the analog transmission systems now in use, the technology confronts broadcasters with a devilish diemma: Digital radio would require listeners to get new radios. As a result, broadcasters that switched to digital would inevitably lose most of their audience -- at least temporarily -- while new radios are purchased.
Beyond the trauma of the transition to digital, another issue frightens broadcasters: Direct satellite broadcasting of music in digital form. Satellite broadcasts could be recieved directly by digital radios, bypassing today's stations. Such a system has been proposed by a startup company, Satellite CD Radio of Washington.
The National Association of Broadcasters is convinced that digital radio will happen, so it has tried to get in front of the issue. The association endorsed a digital transmission system developed in Europe that requires an expansion of the current transmission band. The association proposed that the F.C.C. give all existing broadcasters the right to "homestead" in that new frequency.
But critics note several drawbacks in the association's proposal. For one, they say, it would consume too much of the radio spectrum. But it would also allow speculators to obtain potentially valuable digital licenses through the homestead clause simply by buying cheap, unprofitable AM stations now.

HEADLINE: The Executive Computer;
What a More Powerful Pen-Based Computer Can Do

BYLINE: By Peter H. Lewis

 BODY:
The NCR Corporation has introduced an intriguing pen-based "notepad" computer that is truly ahead of its time. The notebook-size NCR System 3125, operated by an electronic stylus rather than a keyboard, does not yet have any software, and it has not yet received approval from the Government agency that approves electronic devices. While NCR says the System 3125 will be ready in August, it may be many months before there are software applications to take advantage of the machine.
Even so, people who saw the prototype computer at the annual PC Expo trade show in New York City last week said it represents the beginning of a class of computers that are likely to be widely used by businesses in years ahead. Millions of people, from blue-collar workers to doctors, cannot use conventional portable computers because the keyboard is inconvenient when they are walking around on the job. 
 As a result, these workers often record information using a clipboard and a pencil, then re-enter the information into a computer later on. A store clerk takes inventory, an architect sketches a room, a police officer fills out an accident form, an insurance agent fills out an application, and so on. Clearly, these workers could benefit from the computer's power to store and retrieve information. As a result, NCR and dozens of other computer hardware and software companies are racing to develop computer systems that can read handwritten characters and link electronic forms to business data bases.
"The NCR 3125 is the thunder before the storm," said William Bluestein, who tracks the nascent pen-based computer market for Forrester Research Inc. of Cambridge, Mass. "This whole class of computers won't take hold until I.B.M. enters the market -- I.B.M. has spent a ton of money developing its own pen-based machine -- but still, NCR now has about a six-month head start." Although the decline in its market share has been widely noted, I.B.M. is still the dominant computer maker, and many people believe its participation is needed to legitimize the pen-based market. Big Blue says it plans to introduce its pen-based computer by the end of the year.
The only working pen-based notepad computer today is the Grid Systems Corporation's Gridpad. Grid officials said 10,000 Gridpads were sold last year and that the pace this year was "double that." Grid, a division of the Tandy Corporation based in Fremont, Calif., last week showed off its new version of the Gridpad, which differs from the original mainly in its use of an illuminated writing surface.
From a technical standpoint, the NCR machine is significantly more powerful than the Gridpad. The NCR 3125, which weighs slightly less than four pounds, is built around the Intel Corporation's i386 SL microprocessor, which is several generations ahead of the Gridpad's simple 8086 chip. While the Gridpad can "read" only upper-case, block-printed letters, the new NCR machine is apparently able to decipher upper- and lower-case letters with a high degree of accuracy. It cannot, however, recognize cursive writing -- let alone a doctor's handwriting. (The NCR machine uses a cordless stylus, unlike the tethered one used by Grid. At the rate that ink pens are lost, this could turn out to be an expensive liability.)
NCR's machine is also significantly more expensive than the Gridpad. A basic Gridpad costs about $2,500, and the basic NCR 3125 will cost around $4,700, company officials said. The price, NCR officials said, includes the buyer's choice of either the Penpoint operating system being developed by the Go Corporation of Foster City, Calif., or the Windows for Pen Computing operating system being developed by the Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Wash.
Equipped with enhancements, like a modem, hard drive and software, the machine could cost as much as $6,000. "Six grand is a lot to spend to outfit a field technician," said Mr. Bluestein of Forrester Research.
 Alan Lefkof, Grid's president, said the Gridpad is an "electronic clipboard," while the new NCR machine is of an emerging breed he called a "personal productivity tablet." He said Grid planned to introduce its own personal productivity tablet sometime next year, "probably in the same price range as NCR's."
The difference between the two types of pen-based machines, he said, is that electronic clipboards are designed for a blue-collar work force that deals primarily with forms. Such workers typically have no need to run a spreadsheet, for example. The personal productivity tablets, Mr. Lefkof said, are designed for white-collar executives who need the power of a PC to manipulate data in more sophisticated ways.
The true power of these executive notepad systems will become apparent in a year or two when new types of applications, designed specifically for pen-based computers, emerge. "Some day an architect will plug an infrared measuring scanner into the computer, stand at one wall, and the exact room measurements will be captured and converted into a room diagram that can be saved as a standard CAD file," said Ralph A. Phraner, chief executive of the Stylos Development Corporation, citing one example of how pen-based computers might be useful in computer-aided design. "It significantly cuts down on labor, and reduces three site visits to one."
Other likely uses will be the ability to respond to electronic mail with handwritten notes; the ability to send and receive facsimile documents with signatures, sketches and diagrams; calendar and scheduling software, and many features for traveling sales representatives.
Such interesting applications will come about only after some very hard work by software developers in the months and years ahead, of course. And the biggest issue for these software developers is which operating system software to embrace.
 Go, a private company, is believed to be the front-runner with its Penpoint software, scheduled for delivery later this year and already endorsed by I.B.M. Penpoint is a completely new operating system designed for pen computers.
Go's chief rival (seemingly everybody's chief rival these days) is Microsoft, the software giant. Microsoft has vowed to release Windows for Pen Computers before the end of the year, and it has been waging an aggressive campaign to woo software developers. Windows for Pen Computers is an added layer of operating system atop Windows and DOS. Its advantage is that it will work with existing Windows programs as well as any new ones written specifically for pen computers.
Hardware vendors are being circumspect. NCR officials said they would offer both systems and let the customers decide. "The level of diplomacy would make the United Nations proud," Mr. Bluestein said.

HEADLINE: Studying Business? Why Stick to Just One Continent?

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: FONTAINEBLEAU, France

 BODY:
Marieke Bax, a 30-year-old Dutch M.B.A. student, said it would have been foolish to attend a Dutch business school when there are institutions like Insead nestled here in a famous forest 40 miles south of Paris.
"I'm Dutch so I didn't want to go to a Dutch business school," she said. "I wanted to go to a school with an international flavor." 
 She came to the right place: the 460 students studying for a master's degree in business administration at Insead come from 30 countries, with French students comprising just one-sixth the student body. Like other business schools, Insead has study groups in which students work together, but the six students in each group often come from six different nations. What is more, those attending Insead, whose formal name is the Institut Europeen d'Administration des Affaires, have to know three languages to graduate.
After decades of imitating American business schools, Insead's professors say that with the world economy becoming more global, it is time that American schools start copying Insead's international brand of education.
Indeed, officials at Insead -- and at Europe's other truly international business school, the International Institute for Management Development in Lausanne, Switzerland -- contend that they, rather than America's top M.B.A. institutions, should serve as the model for the business school of tomorrow. The two schools, in fact, are so hot that they are spawning imitators around Europe, and American students, in search of an international business education, are flocking to them in record numbers.
"American schools teach international business as a subject," said Daniel Muzyka, a Boston native who teaches entrepreneurship at Insead. "At Insead, it's integrated throughout the curriculum. At Insead, it's the reason for being. The fact that the U.S. is no longer the sole driving engine of the world economy has created more need for a transnational focus."
Officials at the European schools argue that American business schools focus too narrowly on their domestic market at a time when business is becoming far more international, managers are jumping from country to country more than ever before and the United States needs to export more.
"When I go to the U.S., I'm amazed at how little the people who teach mainstream business school courses know about what's going on outside the U.S.," said Kamran Kashani, a marketing professor at the Lausanne school, known as I.M.D. "Many American schools treat international as an elective, and that is a statement about what they think is necessary and what they think is a luxury."
In ways, American business schools have focused naturally on their home country because it is the world's leading industrial power and commercial market. Even so, officials at these schools say that they are becoming more international-minded, introducing more courses on international subjects and taking in more foreign students and faculty.
Over the last two years, Harvard, for instance, has not only increased the number of international cases and courses in its curriculum but also raised the proportion of foreign students to 25 percent from 16 percent of its M.B.A. candidates. Harvard business students now come from 50 countries, but 75 percent of the 1,600 M.B.A. candidates are American. In comparison, I.M.D.'s 65 students come from 30 countries, with no single country representing more than 12 percent of the student body.
"Any business school in the United States can claim that it has many nationalities," said Francis Bidault, director of the M.B.A. program at I.M.D. "But the American schools are dominated by students and faculty coming from one country."
Maybe so, but as some critics like to point out, the European schools are dominated by students from Europe, and thus are pan-European but not truly international. "All of us need to be thinking more in international terms than in continental terms," said Thomas R. Piper, senior associate dean at the Harvard Business School. Insead and I.M.D. have also been criticized for placing heavy emphasis on programs for corporate executives -- a focus that has caused some critics to call them more training schools than academic institutions.
Still, Insead and I.M.D. graduates have become hot commodities as European companies, spurred by plans to scrap internal trade barriers in 1992, jockey to become pan-European and even global. Last year's I.M.D. graduates landed salaries of $74,000 on average, school officials say, substantially above the $63,000 that new Harvard Business School graduates earned. Insead graduates who went to work in the United States earned $64,000 on average. (School officials explain that they compute country-by-country averages, but no overall average because currency fluctuations create distortions.)
One reason for the higher salaries is that I.M.D. and Insead students are generally older and have more work experience than Harvard students. The average age of students at Insead is 28, and at I.M.D. it is 30.
Because their students are older and do not want to take two years off from their climb up the corporate ladder, the European schools usually offer shorter programs than American business schools. Insead's M.B.A. program is 10 months long and I.M.D.'s 11 months. "It's hard to teach management to people who don't have experience in business," said Ludo Van der Heyden, a Belgian who is co-deab if Insead.
One index of how "in" international business schools are is the record number of Americans seeking European M.B.A.'s. "An international education will be an advantage to us in the salary we receive and the types of jobs we're offered," said George Halow, a 29-year-old American at Insead.
Another indication is that even German companies, which have traditionally shunned M.B.A's in favor of in-house training, are hungry to hire graduates of the two schools. Markus Kirchgeorg, a recruiter for Siemens A.G., which interviews 50 people each year at Insead, said, "We need people who have international perspectives, people who think, 'Europe, U.S. and Japan.' For that, an M.B.A. background is very helpful."
As business internationalizes and as more young Europeans clamor to obtain M.B.A's, other European business schools are rushing to imitate I.M.D. and Insead. The London Business School has rapidly increased its international enrollment, so that 60 percent of its full-time M.B.A. students are non-British. In Barcelona, at the Instituto de Estudios Superiores de la Empresa, part of the program is now in English and 40 percent of the students come from outside Spain.
The students who go to I.M.D. and Insead say they cannot help but learn about the cultures and business practices of dozens of other nations. Insead's 79-member faculty comes from 22 countries and teaches many cross-border cases, such as the difficulties Electrolux, the Swedish appliance manufacturer, had in acquiring and absorbing Zanussi, an Italian appliance maker.
And when a study group throws Japanese, Swedish, Italian, Brazilian, French and American students together, they have to learn how to work with people different from themselves. Much of their grade is based on group projects. One American student talked about how difficult it was working with Lebanese and French student group members whose notions of teamwork are so different from American notions.
"You acquire skills that enable you to get all these people working together, despite national differences," said Holt Thrasher, an American student at I.M.D. Or as Dominique Heau, Insead's director of executive education, put it, "Vive la difference is what internationalism is all about."
Insead's policy is to structure study groups to encourage clashes. "We try to make it hard at first," said Arnoud De Meyer, head of Insead's M.B.A. program. "In their future work, they'll confront people they don't like. You have to learn to work with a variety of people."
These international schools are not trying to become a melting pot where students become like each other; instead, they are teaching students to understand differences. At I.M.D., one study group was assigned projects on the business climate in Brazil and on the worldwide paper recycling industry.
"We're not producing homogenized global managers," said Chris Parker, an organizational behavior professor at I.M.D. "We're producing graduates who appreciate the differences between people and why they act the way they do."
As an example of how crucial it is to appreciate differences, I.M.D.'s dean, Juan Rada, cited the way Americans and Japanese executives treat gifts. In the United States, if a company gives a gift to a subcontractor, it might be treated as a bribe; in Japan it would generally be seen as legitimate. The students also examine the short-term focus of American business, the long-term focus in Japan, the in-between approach of the Europeans -- and the pros and cons of those approaches.
"As far as we're concerned, the world is getting bigger, not smaller," said Mr. Rada, who is Chilean. "Until two years ago, we didn't have to know how management worked in Hungary, Romania, Russia and Moldavia. Now we do."
Insead and I.M.D. officials say they place less emphasis on imparting knowledge to their students and more on training people how to apply all the information they have. "The American schools probably go more in-depth in various fields," said Mr. Bidault of the I.M.D. "Our students don't know the latest techniques of finance. We train them to be able to integrate the various dimensions of a problem."
 
 
 
ELDER TRAINING IN EUROPE
 Internationalism is not the only thing that sets Insead apart from American business schools. It also places far more emphasis on educating existing, not just budding, executives. Its 460 M.B.A. students each year are joined by 2,500 executives who spend one week to seven weeks on campus. Executive education is even more dominant at the International Institute for Management Development in Lausanne, which educates 65 M.B.A. students each year and 2,500 corporate executives.
Corporations helped found the two schools, and that largely explains their focus on executive education. Insead was established in 1959 after corporations decided that more business education was needed to help companies cope with the new rules of business resulting from the formation of the European Community. The two schools that merged in 1989 to form I.M.D. were established as executive training schools for Nestle and Alcan.
"We discovered that the real need of Europe was not necessarily the M.B.A., but executive education," said Claude Rameau, co-dean of Insead.
Another factor that has pushed these schools to pay attention to executive education is that they are not attached to universities and have minuscule endowments.
Professors at the two schools say that teaching executives makes them keep their lessons relevant and helps them stay plugged into the latest developments in business. "Our research and teaching has to be oriented toward adding value on Monday morning," said Kamran Kashani, an I.M.D. marketing professor.
Some American professors accuse I.M.D., and to a lesser degree Insead, for being so involved with executive education and being relevant that their research gets short shrift and is often short-sighted. The Europeans respond that research at many American schools is so abstract that it is irrelevant to the needs of business. Even so, both European schools have beefed up their research budgets.

HEADLINE: Cuba vs. Pan Am Games: And the Winner Is?

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: COJIMAR, Cuba

 BODY:
Seven days a week, often late into the night, workers can be seen ferrying truckloads of earth, welding steel beams and laying tiles at the huge seaside athletic complex here that is being rushed into readiness.
Despite being strapped with what the Government has called the worst economic crisis since the seizure of power by Fidel Castro in 1959, Cuba has staked its prestige on the successful hosting of the Pan American Games and with less than five weeks to go before their start is engaged in a frantic and costly race to complete their preparation. 
 Mr. Castro has repeatedly called the games a "sacred commitment that we must honor," vowing that nothing will be allowed to tarnish the country's image. But for many Cubans who must ride bicycles to work through the summer rains because of a lack of public transportation and wash with plain water for lack of soap, the construction of 27 new sports-related installations in the Havana area alone speaks of the Government's insensitivity to more pressing popular concerns.
On the streets of Havana, where long lines of citizens awaiting rationed food can be seen throughout the day, the investment in the games has become the subject of wry jokes. "We want the Pan Americans all right," said one university student. "We want pan," or bread, "and the Americans."
Although the bulk of the new arenas are largely complete, much finishing work remains, and the down-to-the-wire approach has led many to question whether the kinks can be worked out by the opening festivities on Aug. 2.
 
8,000 Workers on the Project
 The rush has been particularly grating for the 8,000 workers employed in the project, who foreign diplomats say have been regularly subjected to directives from Communist Party officials and bureaucrats who descend on the worksites to decree alarmingly imminent deadlines for various facets of the construction.
Diplomats said that the pressures on the workers have led to angry confrontations, with workers rejecting some targets as unrealistic and denouncing the authorities for leading privileged lives in comfortable Havana suburbs while they sweat out 12-hour days in the hot sun with an unappealing supply of rations.
During a guided tour for journalists at one construction site, workers heatedly refused the instructions of one official to clear away debris strewn in a pathway so that journalists could proceed. Returning angrily to the limousine, the official said the obstruction had been created deliberately to keep visitors away.
Cuban officials acknowledge the pressures on workers involved in the project are great, but say the games are a source of immense national pride. Moreover, they say, workers involved in many of the construction projects belong to "micro-brigades," or special construction crews introduced two decades ago who, unlike most Cuban workers, have material incentives for productivity. Many of the 1,403 apartments built to host the expected 5,200 athletes, for example, will later be occupied by these workers.
 
No Details on the Cost
 Even as they decline to provide details on their cost, saying only that it amounts to no more than 1 percent of the country's budget, senior party officials have strenuously defended the decision to proceed with plans to host the games.
"We hope to celebrate games that don't distinguish themselves by their luxuriousness, but by their efficiency and seriousness," said Jose Ramon Fernandez, vice president of Cuba's Council of Ministers, who dismissed reports that the construction projects had cost as much as $500 million.
"We began building these facilities in 1986, when no one could have predicted the changes that took place in Eastern Europe in 1989," Mr. Fernandez added, referring to the collapse of Communist governments that had been important economic partners for Havana. "When that happened, we were half way through with this effort, but went ahead because these were facilities that had to be built sooner or later anyway."

Giuliani Maneuverings
Rudolph W. Giuliani, who prematurely announced his 1993 mayoral candidacy to a gossip columnist at a cocktail party and then backtracked on his statement last week, is nevertheless laying the groundwork for a City Hall run by taking sides in an unusual struggle for control of the comatose Brooklyn Republican organization. 
 The fight is essentially a rehash of the Giuliani/Ronald Lauder battle for the Republican mayoral nomination in 1989 with Mr. Giuliani backing William DiMaria, a mayoral campaign supporter, for the G.O.P. county leadership against Robert DiCarlo, who was a Lauder staff aide. Among Mr. DiMaria's backers is Gerry O'Brien, who started out as Herbert London's mayoral campaign manager and then switched camps to support Mr. Giuliani.
The incumbent Brooklyn Republican leader, Alfred S. Pantaleone, who is also deputy executive director of the Board of Elections, either jumped or was pushed not to seek re-election after 10 years in office. He said he was "tired" and was not taking sides. But he opposes Mr. DiMaria as a "rule or ruin" Republican. Mr. Pantaleone had backed Mr. Lauder for the Republican mayoral nomination.
Mr. Giuliani said that Borough President Guy V. Molinari of Staten Island and his daughter, Representative Susan Molinari, a Staten Island Republican whose district also includes the Bay Ridge section of Brooklyn, are also supporting Mr. DiMaria.
As for Mr. Giuliani's "announcement" of a mayoral candidacy to Cindy Adams of The New York Post, he tried to laugh it off. "I thought I was having a friendly conversation; I was thinking it was a year from now," he said while acknowledging that a mayoral candidacy is "something I would very much like to do."
The former Federal prosecutor doesn't completely rule out a run for the United States Senate next year, but his friends do -- barring an indictment of the Republican incumbent, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, who is under investigation by the Senate Ethics Committee for his role in obtaining Housing and Urban Development contracts for campaign contributors. Even Guiliani fans acknowledge that he would have a difficult time defeating Senator D'Amato in a Republican primary with its conservative electorate, and that he would have a tough time winning the general election without the Conservative Party, which rates him a liberal at heart, in part because of the ties he developed to the Liberal Party during his 1989 mayoral bid.
 
 Nuclear Fallout

The President pro tem of the Connecticut Senate, John B. Larson, a Democrat from East Hartford who considered running for governor last year and who was a strong critic of Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr.'s income-tax plan, has dramatically toned down his oratory in recent weeks.
One possible cause: nuclear waste.
Mr. Larson's district, near Hartford, includes all three sites selected earlier this month by an independent state panel as the final candidates for a low-level nuclear waste dump.
Mr. Larson, whose constituents are vocal and passionate in their opposition to the dump, sought a $500,000 appropriatione for a study of the site selection process. He needed Mr. Weicker's support to convene a separate mini-session to take up the waste study.
Mr. Larson, who had called the Governor's income tax "voodoo economics" only a few weeks ago, changed his tune to being "unconvinced" about the tax after meeting with the Governor.
On Friday, he was rewarded for his lowered decibels. The Governor signed the study bill in Mr. Larson's office.
 
 The Incumbent Edge

It pays -- literally and figuratively -- to be an incumbent member of Congress. Not only are 98 percent of incumbent members of Congress re-elected nationally, but incumbents also do much better than their challengers when they pass the campaign fund-raising basket.
In an analysis of fund-raising patterns in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, the good-government group Public Citizen found that the gap has widened between the fund-raising success of incumbents and challengers in the last decade.
In New Jersey, incumbents in contested races in 1980 raised twice what their challengers were able to muster; in 1990, they raised eight times as much.
In Connecticut, challengers and incumbents raised roughly equal amounts in 1980, but by 1990, the gap there had also risen to eight to one.
In New York, incumbents and challengers also raised about the same amount of money in 1980, but by 1990, the numbers were nine to one in favor of the incumbents.
 
 Rinfret's Pulpit

Last year, Pierre A. Rinfret ran a disasterous Republican campaign for New York governor, but that has not stopped him from issuing periodic newsletters on the state of the state and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo.
The latest lists lots of reasons why Mr. Cuomo "can never be president," including the fact that he never served in the military, didn't do that well last year against "two political amateurs and political unknowns" -- Mr. Rinfret and Herbert London, the state's economic problems, and Mr. Cuomo's "lack of experience in world politics."
Mr. Rinfret, 67 years old, said in a telephone interview that he is not interested in any future candidacies, that he is still active and successful at Rinfret Associates, a Manahattan financial consulting concern, and that he is trying to be non-partisan about the state and its problems. He noted that his next newsletter would discuss "why the Republican Party has failed New York." He sends out about 1,000 newsletters at his own expense to movers and shakers and is about to increase its circulation.

HEADLINE: CONFLICT IN YUGOSLAVIA;
For Yugoslav-Americans, Partisan Emotions and Worries Over the Bloodshed

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

 BODY:
When Croatian- and Slovenian-Americans met for a fish fry and dancing to ethnic music in a Chicago suburb Friday night, their monthly social gathering turned to serious talk of civil war looming in the Yugoslavian federation.
For many immigrants and descendants in the United States, the jubilation over the rebellion for independence in their native lands is now tempered by other emotions.
 
Opposition to the Breakaway
 They are worried by the violence that has erupted, fearful for the future and frustrated at Washington's failure to endorse the declarations of independence by the republics of Croatia and Slovenia. 
 "We celebrate their independence, and we are waiting for our Government to step in and stop the bloodshed," said John Bursa, a retired businessman who attended the fish fry at the Slovene Center in Cicero, Ill.
The divisions pulling apart the Yugoslav union after decades of ethnic, religious, linguistic, economic and political tension are being played out by their relatives in the United States.
Serbian-American groups expressed opposition to the breakaway movement and expressed fear that the United States would officially recognize Croatian and Slovenian sovereignty.
A lawyer and vice chairman of the Serbian Unity Council in Cleveland, Milosh Milenkovich, said his group was in daily communication with Yugoslav officials. He urged that "the unity of Yugoslavia be maintained" but conceded his own doubts, saying, "God knows how it can be retained."
 
Jammed Overseas Phone Lines
 Croatian and Slovenian groups were busy raising money, donating food and clothing, praying, demonstrating and lobbying. Some said they were prepared to return home and take up arms, if necessary.
"When it concerns my own people, I will fight," said Matt Mihaljiv, a Chicago developer from Croatia.
Most Croats and Slovenes expressed the belief that independence will ultimately triumph.
"The people will not go back" to the old system, said the Rev. Slavko Saldo at the Croatian Roman Catholic Church in Manhattan, where hundreds came for an emergency meeting and all-night vigil on Friday. "Independence is the will of our people. It would be slavery to go back."
 
Migration to Industrial Regions
 Anxiously monitoring news reports on the latest events, Yugoslav emigres and relatives have jammed overseas telephone lines for reassurance about the safety of family and friends. Peter Remec of Scarsdale, N.Y., a professor of international law at Fordham University, said it took two days to get a call through to his native Slovenia.
Hundreds of thousands of people from Yugoslavia live in the United States, and even more Americans have ancestors from there.
Their main migration was into the coal and steel regions of Pennsylvania and Ohio and on to Chicago. Gov. George Voinovich of Ohio is the son of a father born in Serbia and a mother born in Slovenia.
The biggest Yugoslavian concentration is in the Chicago region, with 150,000 Croats and Slovenes, according to estimates, and an equal number of Serbs. Cleveland has a total of about 200,000 residents from the three groups.
"I was very happy and overjoyed when Croatia declared its independence," said Lou Matesic, secretary of the Croatian Council of New York. But, concerned about the Yugoslav Army's attempts to crush the move to independence, he is now busy helping arrange a rally today at the United Nations.
 
Thousands of Calls to Washington
 Chicago's groups appear to have organized the most support for independence. Croats there say they have raised nearly $1 million since February, and last month they sent 500 boxes of donated food and clothing.
About 1,200 Croats and Slovenes rallied in Daley Plaza Friday, calling on Washington to reverse its policy. The groups said they made a thousand calls to Washington Thursday and Friday and are also sending letters, telegrams and faxes.
"The U.S. Government is the most powerful government in the world," said Corinne Leskovar, director of a Slovenian radio program in Chicago. "What they have done is betray these two young democracies. Our people are very, very upset -- I would use the words appalled or ashamed -- that the U.S. Government is supporting the Yugoslavian Communist Government."
Yugoslav-American organizations tend to follow the divisions of the old country.
"There was absolutely no relationship to begin with," said Mr. Milenkovich of the Serb group in Cleveland. "All three peoples lived in their own little enclaves."

HEADLINE: Toxic Pollution At Military Sites Is Posing a Crisis

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 29

 BODY:
On the eve of a vote for a second round of military base closings, the Defense Department is running into serious trouble selling or leasing installations already scheduled to be shut because of toxic contamination at the sites.
The military industry has produced the most toxic pollution in the country and virtually every military installation has been extensively contaminated by the hazardous byproducts of activities like repairing aircraft and making weapons and by the disregard of safe practices for disposing of waste. 
 Military officials estimate that it will cost more than $1 billion and take until the end of the decade to restore the environment at just the 86 bases selected in 1988 for closing.
 
Savings Will Be Erased
 Those costs will offset the $5.6 billion in savings over 20 years that the Government had hoped to gain from turning over the bases to private companies or communities.
And the problems affecting the initial round of closings, which were scheduled to be completed by 1995, are virtually certain to become issues with the second round of bases, which are to be selected on Sunday.
In addition to the expense, a thicket of legal and regulatory issues and the concern of potential buyers and managers that they may be liable for damage are emerging as significant barriers to the transfer of the installations and causing concern in the communities where they are situated.
 
'Disaster for My Community'
 "If we don't get these problems worked out, the base closure process will be a disaster for my community and 100 others," said Robert W. Holcomb, the Mayor of San Bernardino, Calif., where Norton Air Force Base is scheduled to be shut in 1994. "The base will sit fallow, a no man's land, with no opportunity for our people to find employment."
The intent of closing military bases was to save the Government the cost of operation and maintenance. The 1988 base closing commission also said the economic effect on communities would be minimized if the military hastened the process of transferring the properties for use in other enterprises.
Neither goal is being reached as the panel envisioned. The problem at Norton and at other installations is that the Government left a mess.
 
A Decades-Old Mess
 The problems were caused by more than four decades of environmental neglect. The haphazard disposal of toxic waste in lagoons, leaking undergroud storage tanks and dump sites caused acres of ground to become saturated with hazardous chemicals that also seeped into underground water supplies. Among the toxic constituents are heavy metals from electroplating, deisel and jet fuel, solvents and degreasing agents from operating machinery and chemical byproducts from munitions manufacturing.
The military services this week estimated that cleaning up more than 1,800 United States installations, including bases, depots, munitions plants and other military centers, would cost $30 billion and take at least a decade. Most experts say they believe it will take much longer than that.
The slow pace of the cleanup, though, is just one of the problems. Another is that Federal law prohibits the Pentagon from selling any property on bases until contamination on the entire site is cleaned up. The law also appears to cover leasing arrangements, say Pentagon lawyers. Thus, even if only 50 acres of a 5,000-acre base are contaminated, the Pentagon is unable to transfer the pristine property until the polluted land is restored.
In Portsmouth, N.H., executives and military authorities negotiating the transfer of Pease Air Force Base are encountering the statute's affect. Pease was the first base on the 1988 list to be closed, taking with it more than 4,000 military and civilian jobs.
 
Negotiating Is Hampered
 For months, state and community leaders, Portsmouth business leaders and a development agency have been negotiating with Deutsche Airbus, the German subsidiary of Airbus Industrie, which wants to use the base for maintenance operations that would employ more than 1,000 people. But the deal is being hampered by the prohibition against selling, and perhaps leasing, property until all of Pease is cleaned up, which would take years.
Roughly 100 of the base's 4,400 acres are contaminated with solvents, fuel and other toxic wastes. The Pentagon has spent more than $10 million investigating polluted sites on the base and tens of millions of dollars more will be needed for a full restoration.
The negotiations with Deutsche Airbus are at such a sensitive stage that members of the Pease Development Authority declined to answer a reporter's questions.
 
Effort to Clarify Law
 This week, Representatives John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan, and Al Swift, Democrat of Washington, sent a letter to the Environmental Protection Agency asking Government lawyers for help in clarifying the law on selling contaminated property.
A Defense Department panel is studying the issue and changes in legislation may be proposed, said Kevin A. Doxey, director of the Pentagon's Defense Environmental Restoration Program Division. He said the panel would make its recommendations in November. "The Pease situation has brought the issue to the front burner," he said. "We're moving as fast and doing everything we can to respond to it."
Representative Richard Ray, the Georgia Democrat who is chairman of the House Armed Services environmental restoration panel, has proposed legislation to allow the Pentagon to sell or lease uncontaminated property.
"It's obvious that they ought not to sell a base that is so contaminated it's dangerous," Mr. Ray said. "But we also don't think a base ought to sit there year after year."
 
Reservations on Altering Law
 Other members of Congress have expressed reservations about changing the law for fear that it might reduce the pressure that communities and Congress could exert on the military to compel faster cleaning of contaminated bases.
The potential that managers and buyers could be liable for future legal, cleanup and health costs as a result of the Pentagon's pollution has emerged as another issue affecting the transfers of bases.
San Francisco, for example, is negotiating with the Navy for a lease that will allow the city to take control of the 550-acre Hunters Point Naval Station, one of the bases on the 1988 closings list. The shipyard, inactive since 1974, has potential to be used for housing, small businesses and other commercial activities.
Hunters Point also is thoroughly contaminated with metal working wastes, fuel, acids and asbestos. The Navy has spent nearly $30 million on cleanup work there and will spend millions of dollars more. San Francisco wants a guarantee from the Navy, or may seek Congressional action to exempt it from liabilities associated with the pollution.
 
Old Base Brings Company Problems
 In the rare instances where the military has succeeded in transferring property from a base it plans to close, companies are encountering a separate set of problems.
One of the first major companies to seek new opportunities on an old base was the Lockheed Corporations. In July 1990, the company formed a subsidiary to lease an old hangar at Norton Air Force Base to modify and maintain Boeing 747 jetliners.
But last summer Lockheed discovered toxic contamination beneath the concrete floor of the hangar. Lockheed needed to remove the floor anyway and replace it with one strong enough to support a 747. Lockheed gained the Air Force's permission to dig up three feet of soil, providing the company enough room to pour new concrete floors.
Days after the Air Force approval, though, the Environmental Protection Agency objected, saying the plan violated an agreement for cleaning up contamination. The agency required a more thorough plan, and a solution that would prevent the polluted soil from contaminate another site after it was dumped. The delays, contracts for an engineering company to design the program, construction and other activities added $6 million to the $40 million project, Lockheed officials said.
"It's been an unbelievable process, a nightmare really," said Richard Crail, vice president and general manager of Lockheed Commercial Aircraft Center. "Unless the rules change, I would be surprised if Lockheed pursues another operation on a closed base."

HEADLINE: In Step Toward Budget, California Assembly Backs Tax Increases

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Calif., June 29

 BODY:
In a major breakthrough in long-stalled negotiations to close a $14.3 billion budget gap, the California Assembly passed large tax increases late Friday night and cut payments to families on welfare.
The actions, which include increases in sales and alcohol taxes and in motor-vehicle fees, still leave California $2 billion to $3 billion away from a balanced budget for the 1992 fiscal year, with a deadline of midnight Sunday. But Gov. Pete Wilson, who had faced a tax rebellion among fellow Republicans in the Assembly, said this afternoon that he was pleased by the actions and that he had received most of what he had asked for from the Democratic-controlled Legislature. 
 The Governor also indicated for the first time today that he might be ready to relent in his longstanding opposition to increasing personal income taxes.
 
Income Tax Surcharge

He and the Legislature have come under increasing pressure from the California Manufacturers Association and other business groups to impose a 5 percent surcharge in income taxes as a substitute for a 6 percent tax on telephone and cable television bills and increasing the tax on utility bills by 2 percentage points.
"I think the business community is saying it does not support personal income or utility taxes, but if it must take bitter medicine they are prepared to take the income tax," Mr. Wilson said at a brief news conference outside his office this afternoon. He added, "We are in a situation in which the Constitution requires a balanced budget."
As for his own position on the income tax, which would raise nearly $1.5 billion, the Governor said, "We have not determined what we'll do." He had previously ruled out any such tax as unhealthy for California's faltering economy.
 
Sunday Meeting
 Both the Assembly and the Senate are scheduled to meet Sunday evening to vote on the final elements of the $54.6 billion budget. and officials in both the Governor's office and the Legislature said they expected to resolve everything by midnight.
The final frenzy comes after weeks of intense arm-twisting, deal making and lobbying. The moderate Republican Governor's chief problem has been persuading Assembly members of his own party to accept the tax increases. The California Constitution requires a two-thirds majority vote on budget matters, and the Governor was able to bring along just enough Republicans to get the bare minimum of 54 votes needed in the 80-member Assembly last night.
The less fractious Senate passed most of the tax increases earlier.
The measures passed by the Assembly Friday night would:
*Raise the state sales tax by 1.25 percentage points, bringing it to 8.25 percent in Los Angeles and other major cities. Also, the tax would be extended to such previously exempted items as candy and snacks, bottled water, newspapers and magazines, and ship and jet fuel. These taxes are expected to raise about $4 billion and would go into effect July 15. The Governor has said $7.7 billion in new taxes will be needed.
*Cut welfare payments by 4.4 percent, or about $31 a month for a woman with two children, who currently receives $694 a month. Also, routine cost of living increases would be suspended for five years.
*Reduce the state's contributions to the California Public Employment Retirement System, or Calpers, as it is called, and use about $1.6 billion of earnings by the fund to help balance the general state budget over the next few years.
Governor Wilson had argued that the fund was too rich and generous and could get by with lower contributions from the state. The Governor drew national attention by proposing to take control of the Calpers board, which has been a thorn in the side of major corporations in which it holds stock.
Ultimately the Governor gave up that fight, but got the Assembly to require that an outside actuary, nominated by the Governor and confirmed by the Senate, determine the appropriate state contribution to the fund.
In addition, the Assembly voted to raise the fees to register vehicles beginning Aug. 1. For example, the fee would rise to $360 from $340 on a two-year-old car that cost $20,000 new. Also, the tax on a gallon of beer or wine would go to 20 cents from less than 4 cents and the tax on a gallon of liquor would go to $3.30 from $2.

HEADLINE: SMALL COMPROMISE ON CITY TAX PLAN

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
The Dinkins administration and the New York City Council took the first halting steps yesterday toward a budget compromise on increased taxes as both sides worked against a deadline of 12:01 A.M. tomorrow for the adoption of a recession-scarred city budget.
The movement came on a day of frenzied maneuvering at City Hall that featured angry demonstrations outside and nonstop meetings and lobbying inside, aimed at reversing the dismissals of thousands of city workers last week and searing cuts in basic city services. 
 The administration is struggling to close a gap totaling at least $3.5 billion between revenue and spending -- some officials have put it as high as $4 billion -- in the city's $29 billion budget, through a combination of service cuts, state aid, taxes and concessions from the city unions.
 
Unions and Council Intertwined
 But the talks between the Mayor and the Council, and the Mayor and the unions, have become deeply intertwined, with neither the union side nor the Council willing to show its hand until the other has reached an agreement.
Union leaders said yesterday that they were willing to make concessions in order to restore the jobs of some of the 6,300 workers laid off on Friday, but not until the outlines of the city's budget were made clear. They want to make sure that jobs saved now will not be lost in a few months, if the city's finances worsen.
"We are ready to make economic sacrifices," said Barry Feinstein, president of Local 237 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. "But we have to know: in return for what? When we ask, they say 'in return for our thanks.' "
At the same time, a budget agreement yesterday between Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and the legislative leaders cleared the way for the city to receive state aid, variously estimated at $75 million to $200 million, that the city had been counting on to balance its budget.
If the complex effort falters, Mayor David N. Dinkins could lose control of the city's finances to a state oversight agency, the Financial Control Board -- a blow to the city's reputation and the Mayor's personal prestige that he has pledged to avoid.
"We are making progress on all fronts," Mr. Dinkins said as he returned to City Hall yesterday afternoon to monitor the parallel negotiations.
Governor Cuomo has scheduled a meeting of the seven-member control board for Tuesday to discuss the city's fiscal problems. Yesterday, he said both he and the control board would play a more active role in the city's affairs "with the Mayor and at the Mayor's request."
"We will be aggressively cooperating with the Mayor," Mr. Cuomo said. "The Financial Control Board should be aggressively cooperative without seeking control."
Mr. Dinkins had called for more than $1.1 billion in new taxes, to make up for declining tax receipts and increasing spending, but the Council, complaining the taxes would damage the city's economy, agreed to a far lower figure, $636 million.
 
Council's Own Budget a Threat
 When an angry stalemate ensued -- with the Mayor orchestrating a lobbying campaign against the Council -- the Council, acting under stronger budget powers granted in the new City Charter, drafted its own budget. Council negotiators had threatened to adopt it today if Mr. Dinkins did not agree to a compromise on taxes.
But in staff talks that began on Friday evening, continued into the early hours yesterday and resumed later in the day, negotiators for the Mayor indicated they could accept something less than the full tax package Mr. Dinkins had originally demanded.
The Council in turn said it was willing to consider a somewhat larger increase in property taxes, particularly if the unions made important concessions that would reduce the cost of government for many years.
As the talks reached critical issues late Friday, the Speaker of the Council, Peter F. Vallone, who had gone home earlier, returned to City Hall to join in the negotiations.
 
Still Far Apart, Official Says
 But one Council official who spoke on the condition of anonymity, because both sides had agreed to a news blackout, said that though the principle of compromise on taxes had been established, both sides remained far apart on a final number.
"I don't think we have arrived at a critical negotiating mass," said one Dinkins administration official. "If a bomb is ticking it is a soft tick."
The Council budget would restore $220 million of the most severe cuts requested by the administration and would increase the property tax by less than what the Mayor had wanted. It would pay for this by making another $300 million in cuts, using reserve funds and starting an early-retirement program for city workers.
Mayor Dinkins denounced the Council budget and said it was out of balance by hundreds of millions of dollars.
Under the City Charter, Mr. Dinkins has the power to reject spending that exceeds his estimate of available revenues and veto additional spending. Yesterday, Council officials stopped short of endorsing the Mayor's criticisms but said they were nonetheless making at least $50 million in additional cuts to eliminate some revenue figures Mr. Dinkins had said he might challenge.
 
Council Seeks Union Concessions
 Council officials said they hoped the additional cuts would put pressure on city unions to come up with concessions before the deadline for adoption of the budget.
The Dinkins administration, seeking up to $600 million in concessions from municipal unions, has given their leaders a list of options, including a roll-back in wage increases and a requirement that the union members pay much of their health-insurance costs.
Union leaders have been hoping to avert layoffs through stepped- up attrition, early-retirement programs, and a change in pension rules that would reduce the city's pension-fund contributions over the next few years.
But city officials have refused to consider any of those changes, which would not hurt individual workers, except as part of long-term cost-cutting concessions. The unions have discussed the concessions among themselves, but not in direct talks with the city, union officials said,
Yesterday Stanley Hill, executive director of the city's largest union, District Council 37 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, said he was optimistic that an agreement could be reached, but discounted the possibility that the unions would make deep concessions.
 
'Still Fighting to Save Jobs'
 "There is no done deal," he said after a speech at a union rally in lower Manhattan. "But we are still fighting to save jobs. We're considering things that will not do further harm to our members."
But last night, after a lengthy negotiating session, other union and city officials said they were increasingly pessimistic that an agreement on concessions could be reached before a budget was adopted. Those same officials, however, suggested the possibility that an agreement could be reached later in the week that would allow some laid-off workers to return to their jobs.
At City Hall yesterday, police officers manned the gates at both the Mayor's and the Council's sides of the building, keeping lobbyists out of a Council meeting room where members were caucusing on budget cuts.
The mood was informal, if serious, with Herbert E. Berman, the chairman of the City Council's Finance Committee, appearing at negotiations in running shorts and shoes, without socks. Even Mayor Dinkins, who is usually seen in public in either fastidious double-breasted suits or baseball warmup jackets, showed up in a pin-cord sports jacket, with casual slacks.
But elsewhere in the city the mood was grim, as city workers who were laid off on Friday listened to the radio to find out whether an agreement was reached that might mean they would have their jobs back soon.

Yankees Weigh the Costs Of Signing or Not Signing

BYLINE: By MALCOLM MORAN

 BODY:
Can the Yankees afford Brien Taylor? Can they afford to pronounce him too costly?
As the mother of the first choice in the baseball amateur draft waits for the Yankees to resume stalled negotiations, baseball executives watch to see if another organization will reaffirm the concept of paying more than $1 million to a recent high school graduate. 
 When the Yankees selected Taylor with their first No. 1 choice since Ron Blomberg in 1967, the organization expected a smooth and brief negotiation with the family of that most rare of baseball commodities -- a left-handed pitcher with a fastball measured as high as 98 miles an hour that a Yankee official volunteered was superior to Dwight Gooden's at a similar stage.
But the process considered simple less than four weeks ago has begun to show signs of becoming a nightmare scenario, a contest of wills the Yankee organization cannot afford to lose.
 
Haggling Wasn't in Plan
 Scott Boras, a California-based attorney with a reputation for aggressively demanding top value for his clients, became an adviser to the family. The $1.2 million agreement reached last summer between high school pitcher Todd Van Poppel and the Oakland Athletics -- with Boras as an adviser at first, and then a representative -- is considered by the Taylors to be the industry standard.
The Yankees maintain that the extraordinary circumstances leading to Van Poppel's contract do not apply to Taylor. Gene Michael, the vice president and general manager, said that the organization's offer was "significantly more" than the reported $345,000 the Atlanta Braves invested in Chipper Jones, a high school shortstop who became the top choice of the 1990 draft. Each side appears resolute in its principles -- the family in gaining what it considers market value; the team in preventing the type of economic spiral that symbolized the era of George Steinbrenner's control.
Michael, the general manager since last August, who also held the position during the 1980 season, faces the challenge of convincing a family from Beaufort, N.C., that a multimillion-dollar New York company, with cable television revenues unprecedented in the history of its industry, is not trying to take advantage of a 19-year-old.
 
No Acrimony but One Warning
 Nearly four weeks since the Yankees chose Taylor over Mike Kelly, an Arizona State outfielder who was the 1990 college player of the year, Michael and Taylor's mother, Bettie, who has represented the family in the talks, have not discussed terms face to face.
Boras has said that the negotiations have not been acrimonious, but he has communicated one warning from the family. According to the adviser, the Taylors have decided that if their son enrolls in a junior college in August, communications with the Yankees would end and they would wait until the 1992 draft.
If Taylor chooses that path, the Yankees would become only the third team in the 27-year history of the June draft to fail to sign the top selection. Their refusal to use the Van Poppel contract as a model, which Michael says is firm, is based on the events that led to the 1990 draft.
Van Poppel, a powerful right-handed pitcher, informed organizations before the draft that he intended to enroll at the University of Texas.
Oakland, using the 14th pick, offered a three-year contract, unprecedented for a high school player, and a $1.2 million package to convince the prospect to change his mind. Van Poppel has already advanced to the Class AA level, two steps from the majors, where he has a 4-7 record and 3.13 earned run average for the Huntsville Stars, a team with a winning percentage of just .382.
In addition to the size of the financial package, Michael was opposed to the procedural risks that an agreement similar to Van Poppel's could create. "That was a bad contract," he said, adding that the A's could eventually face the type of no-win decision with Van Poppel that the Yankees must avoid with Taylor: Advance the prospect to the major league roster before he is ready, or risk losing the pitcher and allowing another team to use a player that had been paid and developed with Yankee money.
"Someone else could reap the benefits," Michael said. "We have to be careful."
"That's so far from the truth," Boras said. The adviser said that Oakland would not risk exposing Van Poppel to the waiver list until 1994, after his fourth spring training with the club. If Taylor signed a similar contract, he would not be available for another organization to claim until 1995.
 
Cost Control
 "If he must clear waivers," Boras said, speaking of Van Poppel, "do you think another major league team is going to go out and claim him, and take him on their major league roster, and pay the salary the A's are paying him? If you believe in your talent assessment, you don't worry about these things, as the A's didn't. You don't draft a player No. 1 and say these things. Otherwise they should have taken Kelly."
 As baseball attempts to control its most recent economic growth spurt, with the understanding that its television revenue may be very different by the time Taylor reaches his prime, Coach Russ Frazier sits at Louisburg (N.C.) College. Frazier, who said the family has given him an oral commitment should Taylor attend college, waits to see if he'll be coaching the most celebrated pitcher of his 32 seasons.
"When people ask, I tell them I'm willing to go 50 bucks above the Yankees' offer," Frazier said, and chuckled.

HEADLINE: For the Nations of Eastern Europe, The U.S. Is More Symbol Than Model

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
SECRETARY OF STATE James A. Baker 3d received two very different receptions in his visits to the Eastern European neighbors Yugoslavia and Albania last weekend. In Yugoslavia, his appeal to the leaders of Slovenia and Croatia not to secede fell on deaf ears and Mr. Baker was bluntly told that his advice was neither valued nor desired. A day later Mr. Baker went to Albania, where he was received by 300,000 Albanians who cheered his every utterance and made him an honorary citizen.
The contrasting receptions reflect America's paradoxical role in the world today. On the one hand, as the Albanians attested, America is still an incredibly powerful symbol of certain basic values -- freedom, democracy, self-determination and economic opportunity -- that tantalize the long-suppressed peoples of Eastern Europe. The Albanians who poured out to receive Mr. Baker did so with an almost religious fervor, armed with crudely made paper American flags and placards that were more passionate than grammatical: "Welcome Mr. Becker," said one, "Welcome Mr. Beaker," said another. They were never quite sure what his name was, but then it didn't really matter, because for them he was no more a person than the papier-mache Statue of Liberty that Chinese students erected two years ago in Tiananmen Square. 
 "America is a big myth here," said Ilir Ikonomi, an Albanian journalist. For four decades freedom is what Albanians wanted and under totalitarian Communism they could not have it. America represented that freedom and so when it showed up on the streets of Tirana for the first time in the form of James A. Baker 3d, Albanians celebrated it. A week before Mr. Baker arrived, the German Foreign Minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, also made his first visit to Albania. No Albanians came out to receive him, even though ultimately they will probably get more material aid from Bonn than from Washington. Germany symbolizes nothing for them. Only America has such emotive powers.
But what is both ironic and poignant is that when it comes to providing something more than a symbol, the United States falls short. It is at a loss to provide a blueprint for how these multinational Eastern European societies -- whether it is Yugoslavia or the Soviet Union -- can get from where they are now to the democratic destinations they profess to seek. "The Federalist Papers" do not translate well into Serbo-Croatian or Russian -- or Georgian, Lithuanian, Ukranian or Azerbaijani.
America's brand of federalism aims to forge one nation from people of diverse origins. That is not a realistic aim for multinational societies like the Soviet Union or Yugoslavia. For them, the challenge is to design political structures that can contain many nations -- who want to retain their separate national identities -- yet remain part of a single political and economic unit.
"The challenge confronted by the multinational states of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union is that they are at once too large and too small," said Michael J. Sandel, a Harvard political theorist. "If Slovenia or Azerbaijan want to break off, they are too small to compete economically in a global economy. After all, even France and Germany prefer to be members of a larger economic unit, the European Community. But Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union are also too large to give full expression to the national identities of their constituent communities. So economics is pulling them toward bigger units and culture is pulling them toward smaller units."
That is not the only problem. As events in both Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union so dramatically demonstrate, when democratic reforms are suddenly loosed on these previously repressed multinational societies the risk is that what will emerge first and foremost are intense forms of nationalism: not secular, pluralistic Jeffersonian democrats, but rather Serbian, Armenian, Croatian, Russian and Albanian nationalists.
Precisely because nationalism can turn ugly and undemocratic and trample on individual rights, Mr. Sandel said, central governments in these countries not only have to be loose enough to allow national self-expression, but also strong enough to protect minority rights -- much the way the Federal judiciary in the United States, invoking the Constitution, steps in to preserve civil rights from abuses by states and localities. Central authorities will be needed to protect the Serbian minority in Croatia, or the Armenian minority in Azerbaijan, and minorities everywhere else in the ethnic patchwork of Eastern Europe.
The challenge of politics then in these countries, and in some ways for American foreign policy, is to design federal arrangements that would help these societies manage these conflicting impulses while holding together. But it will require a kind of federalism not yet invented.
 
One Democracy's Glue
 "We often forget how unique is our experience," said the historian Daniel J. Boorstin. "In America you become a democrat simply by crossing the ocean and becoming part of the American community. It's easy. At the same time, we have developed a series of institutions and traditions that help us keep in balance our sense of community and quest for independence. Everything from baseball to technology to television help overshadow our separate family genealogies, reinforce our sense of common history and keep alive what Lincoln called 'the mystic chords of memory that remind us of the better angel in each of us.' But the Soviets or Yugoslavs cannot become democrats by simply dropping a few phrases. You need the right institutions."
That is not the only reason, though, why America will have a hard time being helpful. America itself is torn between conflicting impulses when it looks on the Albanias and Yugoslavias. The United States has been both a force for order and an agent of change in the world, both a seditious revolutionary and a policeman. Mr. Baker loved being celebrated as the symbol of liberation in a place like Albania, and he urged the crowd on, but the same man recoiled in horror when he saw freedom giving rebirth to dark tribal nationalisms in Yugoslavia.
As the political scientist Robert W. Tucker has written, America favors "freedom of nations" but often has problems dealing with "freedom in nations" when it leads to self-determination for smaller and smaller groups. That becomes a threat to the international order. But where should the line be drawn? Why do the Latvians deserve American support for an independent state and not the Croats? Why the Estonians and not the Slovenians? These are tough calls that are only going to get tougher in the coming years.

How Tito's Heirs Made A Mess of Yugoslavia

BYLINE: By DAVID BINDER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
YUGOSLAVIA'S latest agony its third in this century after the deaths of more than one million citizens in each of the two world wars -- is traceable in many respects to one man: Josip Broz Tito.
It was Tito who in 1971 cut down the bright younger politicians -- men and women -- who might have led the country on a more liberal path nearly two decades ahead of the overthrow of Communist regimes in Eastern Europe. 
 It was Tito who created the cumbersome and ultimately unworkable 84-page constitution of 1974 on which the Yugoslav ship of state is currently foundering.
Tito died in 1980 at 87, having ruled Yugoslavia for 36 years as a kind of Communist king with all the royal trappings except a mace and a crown. He designated no successor, leaving the country to a manifold dynasty of lesser Communist officials in Belgrade and the republican capitals. With few exceptions they were men stunted by the suffocating atmosphere of a one-party state.
With few exceptions these children of Tito are also directly responsible for the mess confronting the 24 million people of Yugoslavia today. They are the ones who held on to the Communist Party structure until it fell apart in 1990 -- well after the Communists had been thrown out in all of Eastern Europe except Albania. They are the ones who have retained the vast bureaucracies and habits of the Marxist-Leninist-Stalinist-Titoist system even after more or less democratic elections were held in each of the six republics.
This is not to say that all of Tito's heirs have behaved badly. The Bush Administration, European governments and many Yugoslavs agree that Prime Minister Ante Markovic, 66, has done his utmost to hold the country together while accommodating the outrageous behavior, including the wholesale theft of Government funds, of colleagues . Others widely credited with having conducted themselves maturely in the crisis are Macedonia's Kiro Gligorov and Vasil Tupurkovski and Bosnia-Hercegovina's Alija Izetbegovic. Of these only Mr. Izetbegovic was not a Communist.
But Mr. Markovic and these allies have not been able to muster sufficient strength to overcome the separatist demands of the leaders of Croatia and Slovenia or the hegemonistic designs of the leaders of Serbia.
The principal antagonists among Tito's children are Serbia's President Slobodan Milosevic, 49; Croatia's President Franjo Tudjman, 69; and Slovenia's Milan Kucan, 50. For all the antagonism between Mr. Milosevic and the other two, these men have much in common.
All three were members of the former Communist Party. Since they were affirmed in power in republican elections last year, all three have exhibited authoritarian tendencies, maintaining heavyhanded control of the newspapers and television stations in their capitals -- excluding news and views from parts of Yugoslavia that they deem hostile. All three have raised and equipped private armies. None has dismantled the ponderous government bureaucracies or the overstaffed factory managements inherited from the Communist era.
Mr. Tudjman, who reached the rank of general in Tito's army of Partisans, has even instituted an honor guard with splashy uniforms that could be worn in a performance of a 19th century operetta.
In short, while chosen in relatively democratic elections, none of these three republican presidents could remotely be called a democrat.
All of that might matter less if these men had not indulged themselves in the most jingoist kind of nationalisms -- a cardinal sin for Communists as they well know, and a lethal malady for anyone in the ethnic stewpot that is the Balkans.
This indulgence has had bloody consequences: : 29 Serbs and Croats killed in communal violence in the last six months; perhaps as many as 100 people killed in last week's clashes in Slovenia; and more than 90 ethnic Albanians shot by militiamen in the troubled Serbian province of Kosovo.
The motive of Tito's children for promoting radical Serbian, Croatian and Slovenian nationalism? One can only conclude Messrs. Milosevic, Tudjman and Kucan have chosen this as a sure means of holding on to power inside the confines of their republican borders.
But you cannot eat nationalism. Nor does it fuel automobiles or produce electric power. Yugoslavia's economy, which could be booming, faces disaster. Production has dropped 50 percent. There is little or no money to pay wages in any of the republics. All because of the political struggle.
Is there any hope?
Yugoslavia could still implode into the kind of civil war that left one million dead in the period 1941-45. Or, it could fall apart in order to reconstitute itself along the lines of a compromise drafted only three weeks ago by the republics Macedonia and Bosnia-Hercegovina . Under this plan, each republic could retain a measure of sovereignty while a central government controlled finance and defense.
But whether this can be achieved by leaders whose idea of politics is a combination of narrow nationalism and authoritarian practices is questionable, if not doubtful.
There are democratic forces in Yugoslavia, in all of the republics. Demonstrations in Belgrade last March showed there are many thousands of anti-nationalist Yugoslavs -- especially among young people. It is this Europe-minded generation, comfortable with the West and free of the worst habits of Communist lockstep, who might be called the grandchildren of Tito and the remaining hope of Yugoslavia.

Is the Vote, Too, Wasted On Youth?

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
WHEN 18-, 19- and 20-year-olds won the right to vote 20 years ago today, proponents heralded the ratification of the 26th Amendment as a sure remedy for the alienation of the nation's youth. With a direct role in the political process, they reasoned, young people would no longer feel disconnected.
"We will gain a group of enthusiastic, sensitive, idealistic and vigorous new voters," Senator Edward M. Kennedy said at the time. 
 While the enthusiasm may still be there, it is not for voting. Turnout among young people is shrinking with every election. The fact is, the vaunted youth vote never became the electoral force that some expected it to be.
Unlike many of their elders, young people nowadays cannot be accused of abandoning the political process. Most were never involved in the first place.
"You can't drag people in to vote," said Birch Bayh, the former Democratic Senator from Indiana who helped draft the Constitutional Amendment with Mr. Kennedy. "My disappointment goes not only to the fact that young people aren't voting, but that neither are their parents."
The young, however, are the least likely to exercise their right to vote, the most quantifiable form of political participation. Voting among youth dropped sharply after a high of 48 percent in 1972. In 1976, the figure was 38 percent, and 33 percent of 18- to 20-years olds said they voted in the 1988 elections, as opposed to 57 percent of the population as a whole.
Sounding civic-minded alarms about these statistics are a host of public interest and voter participation organizations, from the League of Women Voters to the Y.M.C.A.
"This is more than a matter of abstract good citizenship," said Sanford D. Horwitt, director of the citizens participation project for People for the American Way, a liberal advocacy group. "This relates to real public policy." As an example, Mr. Horwitt said, urban school systems face terrible budget problems but often have low political priority at least partly because the young people who have first-hand, recent experiences in public education tend not to vote.
Trying to explain the decline, many politicians and academics repeat the same adjectives used in the 1960's by those who championed the youth vote: that young people feel "disaffected" and "disenfranchised." But a New York Times/CBS News Poll conducted on the eve of last November's elections found, in fact, that younger people seemed to be less turned off by politics than were their elders.
Asked how often they could trust the Government in Washington to do what is right, 28 percent of the 18- to 29-year-olds said most of the time, a response given by only 20 percent of those 30 and over. And 37 percent of the 18- to 29-year-olds agreed that it makes no real difference who is elected, compared with 45 percent of those aged 30 and over.
 
What's the Problem?
 If they are not completely disgusted by politics, why are young people not voting? Some argue that the issues now are not as compelling as, say, the Vietnam War, and that members of the current young generation are too self-absorbed.
Another reason, argues Senator Kennedy, is the dearth of inspirational figures. "I think young people are thirsting for leadership," he said. "They want to be asked to do things. I don't think during the last 10 years anybody has asked anyone to do anything for any one."
An 18-year-old from Middletown, Del., named Drew, interviewed as part of focus group on voter participation by People for the American Way, said he thought teachers and parents were not doing enough to encourage young people to vote. "As soon as you turn 18," he said, "it's not like you can just switch on our 'vote' modes and go out and vote."
There are also practical explanations: Young people are so transient that it can be difficult getting them to the polls or registered in the first place, with many confused over whether to list their residence with their parents or in their college dormitory.
Hoping to increase voting among the young, a coalition of about 50 organizations announced a campaign on Friday to institute voter registration drives in public high schools across the country.
"We ought to have a vision," said Mr. Horwitt, a leader of the coalition, "that everybody gets out of high school with a diploma in one hand and a voter registration card in another."
But Curtis B. Gans, director of the Committee for the Study of the American Electorate, a Washington group, argued that the most aggressive registration efforts never translate into significant rises in turnout. "My judgment is that in the absence of a deep recession, which would cause a temporary upsurge in turnout, we're not likely to turn this around any time soon." In the meantime, others are pressing for assorted schemes to entice young people to vote, including lobbying for pending "motor voter" legislation that would allow a person to register to vote in conjunction with obtaining a driver's license.
Patrick Lipper, executive director of Rock the Vote, a record industry group based in Los Angeles, contends that the best way to stir young people politically is on the issue of censorship of records. To advance that message, the coalition has broadcast several public service spots on the MTV Network.
In one 60-second commercial, Madonna, while being spanked by two male dancers, warns viewers: "If you don't vote, you're going to get a spankie."

The Conservative Majority Solidifies

Criminal Law
 
Rights of Convicted Cut Back Sharply
Two rulings among the many significant ones of the term, which lasted from Oct. 1, 1990, to June 27, cut back sharply on the ability of death row inmates and other state prisoners to challenge the constitutionality of their convictions or sentences by filing petitions for writs of habeas corpus in Federal court. Both were decided by 6-to-3 votes, with Justices Marshall, Blackmun and Stevens dissenting. 
 In the first, McCleskey v. Zant, No. 89-7024, the Court raised almost insurmountable barriers to the filing of second or successive habeas corpus petitions. Federal judges must dismiss such petitions as an "abuse of the writ" except in unusual circumstances, Justice Kennedy's majority opinion said.
The second case, Coleman v. Thompson, No. 89-7662, held that inmates forfeit their ability to bring even an initial Federal habeas corpus petition if, through a lawyer's miscalculation or some other procedural error, they have failed to present their appeal properly in the state courts. Justice O'Connor's opinion overturned a 1963 Warren Court landmark, Fay v. Noia, which held that state prisoners were entitled to seek relief from the Federal courts as long as they had not "deliberately bypassed" state proceedings.
The Court ruled that the use of a coerced confession in a criminal trial does not automatically invalidate a conviction, but may be treated as "harmless error" if other evidence introduced at the trial was adequate to sustain a verdict of guilty.
The 5-to-4 decision overruled part of a 1967 precedent, Chapman v. California, under which a coerced confession could never be treated as harmless error. Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote the opinion, Arizona v. Fulminante, No. 89-839, which was joined by Justice Souter.
The Court overruled two other recent precedents on the last day of the term, voting 6 to 3 to permit prosecutors in death sentence proceedings to introduce evidence about a murder victim's character and the effect of the crime on the victim's family. Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote the opinion, Payne v. Tennessee, No. 90-5721.
It overruled two earlier decisions, Booth v. Maryland in 1987 and South Carolina v. Gathers in 1989, in which the Court ruled unconstitutional the use of victim impact evidence in death penalty cases. Justices Marshall, Stevens and Blackmun dissented from the new ruling, Justice Marshall with an angry warning that the majority's approach to precedent cast doubt on the stability of many of the Court's constitutional landmarks.
Making it harder for prisoners to bring lawsuits challenging prison conditions, the Court ruled 5 to 4 that the hardships of prison life do not violate the Constitution unless prisoners can show that the prison's officials have acted with "deliberate indifference."
The decision, based on the Court's interpretation of the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment, changed the focus of earlier rulings from the conditions themselves to the state of mind of the officials. Justice Scalia wrote the majority opinion, Wilson v. Seiter, No. 89-7376, which Justice Souter joined.
The Court voted 5 to 4 to uphold a mandatory life sentence without parole for nonviolent first offenses including possession of as little as 1.5 pounds of cocaine. Justices Scalia and Kennedy supported the judgment in Harmelin v. Michigan, No. 89-7272. The Court rejected the argument that the Michigan law at issue, the only such law in the country, imposed cruel and unusual punishment. Justice Souter joined the Kennedy plurality.
The Court ruled 6 to 3 that the police do not necessarily violate the Constitution by boarding long-distance buses, approaching passengers at random, and obtaining permission to search their luggage for drugs.
Justice O'Connor's opinion, Florida v. Bostick, No. 89-1717, overturned a ruling by the Florida Supreme Court, which held that police questioning within the cramped confines of a bus was inherently coercive. Justice O'Connor said the question was whether, under the "totality of the circumstances," a reasonable person would feel free "to terminate the encounter."
The Court ruled that drugs or other evidence discarded by a fleeing suspect can be admitted in court regardless of whether the police had any reason to suspect the person had committed a crime when they began chasing him. The 7-to-2 decision, California v. Hodari D., No. 89-1632, was written by Justice Scalia. He said that because a fleeing suspect has not been "seized," the Fourth Amendment's prohibition against unreasonable search and seizure does not apply.
The Court ruled 5 to 4 that people who are arrested without a warrant may be imprisoned for as long as 48 hours awaiting a determination of whether the arrest was proper. Justice O'Connor wrote the opinion, County of Riverside v. McLaughlin, No. 89-1817, with Justice Souter in the majority. A 1975 Court decision had required "prompt" determination, without defining the term.
The Court broadened the ability of the police to conduct warrantless searches of suitcases and other closed containers found in cars, overturning a 1979 precedent that barred such searches unless there was probable cause to search the entire car. Under the new ruling, California v. Acevedo, No. 89-1690, the police can search the container as long as they have probable cause to believe it contains drugs or other contraband. Justice Blackmun wrote the 6-to-3 decision.
In one of a handful of decisions in which a criminal defendant prevailed, the Court overturned a Mississippi inmate's murder conviction and death sentence in Minnick v. Miss., No. 89-6332. The Court ruled that once a suspect has asserted his right to a lawyer, the police may not initiate further questions unless the lawyer is present. Justice Kennedy wrote the 6-to-2 decision, with Justice Scalia and Chief Justice Rehnquist dissenting; Justice Souter did not participate.
 
 
 
Free Speech and Press
Abortion Advice Can Be Forbidden
 In the ruling that stirred the most intense public reaction of any this term, the Court upheld Federal regulations that bar family planning clinics that receive any Federal funds from all discussion of abortion with their patients.
The vote in Rust v. Sullivan, No. 89-1391, was 5 to 4, with Justice Souter joining Chief Justice Rehnquist's majority. The opinion swept away First Amendment and statutory arguments against the regulations, which were adopted by the Reagan Administration to replace longstanding rules under which health counsellors had been required to inform pregnant women of all their options, including abortion. The Chief Justice said that although abortion was a "protected right," the Government was not constitutionally required to "subsidize" speech about it.
In a celebrated libel case, the Court ruled 7 to 2 that fabricated quotations attributed to a public figure may be libelous only if the alterations materially change the meaning of what the person actually said. Justice Kennedy's opinion, Masson v. The New Yorker, No. 89-1799, permitted Dr. Jeffrey Masson's libel suit accusing a writer, Janet Malcolm, of fabricating quotes to go to trial, but ruled that taking liberties with quotations does not necessarily amount to "falsity" of the kind that establishes liability.
The Court ruled, 5 to 4, that the First Amendment does not protect news organizations from lawsuits for breaking promises of confidentiality to news sources. Justice White wrote the 5-to-4 opinion, Cohen v. Cowles Media, No. 90-634; Justice Souter wrote a dissent.
The Court ruled that while erotic nude dancing is a form of expression with some First Amendment protection, states may ban it. The vote in Barnes v. Glen Theatre, No. 90-26, was 5 to 4, with a plurality opinion by Chief Justice Rehnquist and a concurring opinion by Justice Souter.
In Gentile v. State Bar, No. 89-1836, the Justices upheld the limits that most states impose on public comments that lawyers can make about pending cases, but it said that the rules had to be precisely written so lawyers know what is prohibited. Justice O'Connor provided a swing vote for shifting 5-to-4 majorities. She joined Chief Justice Rehnquist in holding that Nevada's rule did not infringe lawyers' First Amendment rights, and Justice Kennedy in holding that the rule was unconstitutionally vague. Justice Souter voted with the Chief Justice.
 
 
 
Federal Authority
Rescue of S.& L.'s Avoids Liability
 The Court ruled unanimously that the Federal Government cannot be sued for damages when efforts by Federal banking regulators to rescue troubled savings and loan associations go awry. The decision, U.S. v. Gaubert, No. 89-1793, written by Justice White, was a source of relief to the Government, which faced lawsuits with a possible liability in the billions of dollars.
The Court ruled that the Government can be sued over the way it is administering the amnesty provisions of the 1986 immigration law. The 7-to-2 decision, written by Justice Stevens, rejected the Government's view that the Federal courts have no jurisdiction to hear class-action lawsuits on behalf of large groups of illegal aliens. Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justice Scalia dissented in McNary v. Haitian Refugee Center, No. 89-1332.
 
 
 
Civil Rights
Schools Get a Way To Stop Busing
 The Court ruled, 5 to 3, that formerly segregated school districts may be released from court-ordered busing once they have taken all "practicable" steps to eliminate the legacy of segregation. Chief Justice Rehnquist's opinion, in a case from Oklahoma City, left many questions unanswered, including the definition of "practicable" and how to decide when "vestiges" of segregation have been eliminated.
The Court will attempt to answer those questions next term in a similar case from suburban Atlanta, when the Chief Justice may have a more comfortable margin. Justice Souter did not participate in the Oklahoma City case, Board of Education v. Dowell, No. 89-1080.
The Court ruled that the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which bars sex discrimination on the job, forbids employers from barring women from jobs that might harm a developing fetus. Justice Blackmun wrote the opinion, Automobile Workers v. Johnson Controls, No. 89-1215, invalidating a policy that a battery manufacturer had adopted to avoid exposing female workers to lead.
All nine Justices agreed that the particular policy was illegal, but were divided over what standard to apply. Justices Souter, Marshall, O'Connor and Stevens agreed with Justice Blackmun's view that such policies are always illegal.
In cases from Louisiana and Texas, the Court ruled that the Voting Rights Act of 1965 applies to elections for judges. The two 6-to-3 opinions by Justice Stevens open many state court systems, particularly in the South, to challenge on the ground that judicial district lines are drawn in ways that diminish the chances of electing black or other minority judges. The cases were Chisom v. Roemer, No. 90-757, and Houston Lawyers v. Texas Attorney General, No. 90-757. Justices Scalia, Kennedy and Chief Justice Rehnquist dissented.
The Court ruled that neither the Federal law against age discrimination nor the Constitution bars states from setting ages at which judges must retire. The vote in Gregory v. Ashcroft, No. 90-50, was 7 to 2. Justice O'Connor, in a majority opinion joined by four others, based her conclusion on a view of state-Federal relations that suggests a willingness to overturn recent precedents that uphold Federal authority at the expense of the states. Justice Souter voted with Justice O'Connor.
In two decisions, both written by Justice Kennedy, the Court expanded significantly on its bar against excluding jurors on the basis of race. In Edmonson v. Leesville Concrete Co., No. 89-7743, the Court ruled 6 to 3 that neither side in a civil case can use race as a basis for excluding jurors. In Powers v. Ohio, No. 89-5011, it said that defendants in criminal trials can object to the prosecution's exclusion of jurors based on race, even if the defendant and the excluded juror are of different races.
The Court ruled 6 to 3 that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 does not protect American workers overseas from discrimination by U.S.-based employers. Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote the opinion, Equal Employment Opportunity Comm. v. Aramco, No. 89-1838.
 
 
 
Business
Juries Keep Discretion Over Damages
 The Court decisively rejected a long-awaited constitutional attack on punitive damages. The 7-to-1 decision left juries with the broad discretion over damage awards that the insurance industry and other business groups have attacked as a violation of the guarantee of due process of law. Justice Blackmun wrote the majority opinion and Justice O'Connor dissented in Pacific Mutual v. Haslip, No. 89-1279.
The Court rejected an Internal Revenue Service position, ruling 7 to 2 that savings and loan institutions can create paper losses for Federal income tax purposes by swapping portfolios of low-value mortgages with other S.& L.'s . Justice Marshall wrote the opinion, U.S. v. Centennial Savings Bank, No. 89-1926.
In an important copyright ruling with broad implications for the computerized information industry, the Court ruled unanimously that the alphabetical listing of names and addresses in the white pages of a phone directory is not protected by Federal copyright law. Justice O'Connor wrote the decision, Feist Publications v. Rural Telephone Service, No. 89-1909.
 
 
 
PRECEDENTS WERE OVERTURNED IN SEVERAL CRIMINAL CASES
 The Court overturned five of its own precedents this term.
Automobile Searches: In California v. Acevedo, the Court overruled a 1979 decision, Arkansas v. Sanders, which had barred the police from warrantless searches of suitcases or other containers in cars without probable cause to search the car itself. Now they are free to search the container as long as they have probable cause to believe it contains contraband.
Coerced Confessions: In Arizona v. Fulminante, the Court said the use of a coerced confession at trial can be "harmless error" if other evidence supports a verdict. A 1967 case, Chapman v. California, held that coerced confessions could never be harmless.
Habeas Corpus: In Coleman v. Thompson, the Court ruled that most state prisoners who fail through a lawyer's error or other mistake to present their appeals properly to state court forfeit their right to Federal court review. It overruled a 1963 landmark, Fay v. Noia, under which prisoners could file Federal petitions for writs of habeas corpus as long as they had not "deliberately bypassed" state courts.
Victim Impact Evidence: In a 1987 case, Booth v. Maryland, and again in South Carolina v. Gathers in 1989, the Court barred prosecutors in death sentence proceedings from introducing evidence about the victim's character or the grief of a victim's family. Those cases were overruled in Payne v. Tennessee.
 
 
 
EXCEPT ON LAW AND ORDER, SOUTER REMAINS A MYSTERY
 It is not surprising that David H. Souter has not yet established a clear judicial voice after barely nine months on the Court. New Justices seldom do.
After a slow start, he produced eight opinions -- less than his mathematical share, but not dramatically so. Justice Harry A. Blackmun had 10 opinions and Justice Antonin Scalia had 11. There was evidence that Justice Souter was assigned one or two additional cases, but lost a majority after Justices switched sides.
His opinions included criminal cases, complex commercial disputes, and a border conflict between Illinois and Kentucky. His approach is methodical and comprehensive. His questions from the bench are probing, delivered in a polite but firm manner and demonstrating his grasp of the issues.
But he evidently has not yet adopted the veteran Justices' habit of delegating much research and writing to law clerks. One of his opinions, handed down on the last day of the term, was in a complicated securities case argued Oct. 9, the first day he sat on the Court.
The term did relatively little to resolve the mysteries that lingered after Justice Souter's confirmation last September. It was evident from his record as a state court judge and New Hampshire attorney general that he is a law-and-order conservative, and so he proved, in a term with many criminal cases. He has yet to be heard on race, religion and abortion.
At age 51, he is the Court's youngest member, and has replicated as best he can the ascetic lifestyle he maintained in New Hampshire. He lives in a rented apartment in a modern complex in southwest Washington. He works late in his chambers most nights, and then often runs on a track at an Army base near his apartment before going home to a late supper.

HEADLINE: So What's Going On in the Soviet Union?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The United States news media, The Times included, is presenting the Soviet Union in an incorrect light. 
 True, people are dying of political-ethnic violence in Armenia, but at the same time, the Armenian economy is growing. Most important, Russia, by far the largest and most populous part of the Soviet Union, is quite calm. (I was in Leningrad for the last two weeks of May. I also spent two days in Estonia.)
There is no hunger, mood of revolt or danger of a social explosion of any kind. People are annoyed at the economic difficulties, yes, but at the same time they are going about living their lives, and they laugh at the talk of impending disaster that is now so common in the West.
On June 18, NBC News used the word "turmoil," and on June 19, Sidney Blumenthal stated in "Boris at the Front Door" (Op-Ed) that "Soviet politics have become chaotic and irrational." I protest. I saw and heard nothing to warrant such sensationalist terminology. It is frightening Western tourists away at a time when the Soviet Union could really use their money.

HEADLINE: Making a Difference;
Tinkering at Radio Shack

BYLINE: By BARBARA PRESLEY NOBLE

 BODY:
Radio Shack grew into the largest retailer of home electronics by selling solid if unflashy house-brand consumer electronics and electronics parts. But last week it said it would do a bit of tinkering with its successful formula.
 Radio Shack's parent, the Fort Worth-based Tandy Corporation, announced that in September some Radio Shacks would begin selling name-brand products. A week earlier, Tandy said it would open six stores to sell name-brand computers as well as its own line of machines. 
Was Tandy taking defensive action to halt the four-year slide in profit as a percentage of revenues and to cushion the shock of the most recent quarterly earnings, which were 50 percent lower than expected? Not precisely, says Bernard S. Appel, the fast-talking 59-year-old president of Radio Shack. He concedes that his unit, which last year contributed roughly $2.9 billion of Tandy's $4.5 billion in sales, did not do as well last year as the year before, but he says Radio Shack's problems are those of the industry as a whole -- mainly the general flatness in consumer electronics.
 In a phone interview from Chattanooga, Tenn., where he received an honorary doctorate from McKenzie College, a two-year business school, Mr. Appel scoffed at the notion of a fundamental change in direction. He said Radio Shack expected to add only about 1 percent to its sales volume by selling higher-end audio and video equipment, like large-screen televisions, in 140 of the 4,500 company-owned Radio Shack outlets. The 140 outlets will be in remote markets where there is little competition.
 Mr. Appel thinks Tandy's performance will improve as the recession ends and consumers resume spending. But Some analysts are less sanguine. "True, there is softness in consumer electronics, but Radio Shack labors under a stigma," said Charles Wolf, an analyst at Goldman Sachs. "It hasn't been able to establish its Realistic label as a viable alternative to the Japanese."
 The company plans to stick to basics. "We won't de-emphasize our major thrust, which is still private-label products," Mr. Appel said.

HEADLINE: West Cork's Wild Peninsulas

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE S. COZZENS; CHRISTINE S. COZZENS, a teacher of writing at Agnes Scott College, in Decatur, Ga., has visited Ireland many times.

 BODY:
IN the language of history and legend, the lure of the West of Ireland has always had a magical quality. The English, who never succeeded at bringing the western reaches of the island under their authority, believed that the farther one traveled beyond the limits of the Crown's jurisdiction the less the rules of civilization applied. Enveloping the southwestern corner of Ireland, County Cork spreads out from the republic's second largest commercial city, Cork. But its western peninsulas -- the Mizen and the Beara -- retain their wild aspect, and unlike the more famous Ring of Kerry to the north, the ring routes that edge their jutting cliffs and sheltered harbors have not yet become worn paths of tourism.
West Cork, sometimes known as West Carbery in the ancient baronial nomenclature, has always been a land unto itself. The soft southwestern climate maintained by the Gulf Stream nurtures palm trees, banks of fuchsia and rhododendrons and midwinter wildflowers along a ragged coastline formed of limestone and slate. Boiling seas at Dursey Island, Sheep's Head and Three Castle Head menace shipping while guarding the graceful bays -- they are really drowned valleys -- of Bantry, Dunmanus and Roaringwater. 
 Rich in natural resources such as copper and other minerals, an abundance of perfectly formed harbors, fish, shellfish, mild weather and extraordinary scenery, the peninsulas of West Cork beguiled would-be conquerors from the ancient Irish tribes, to the Vikings, to the English under Cromwell and to early 20th-century schemers. Again and again, twists of circumstance and human folly defeated the aspirations to prosperity of every generation that attempted to settle the long fingers of pastureland and bleak rock stretching westward.
The tantalizing copper and barite lodes -- like those that lined the slopes of Mount Gabriel near Schull -- proved less rich and more treacherous to mine than expected. In the 18th century, sailing ships packed the harbors of West Cork to take on supplies, but the coming of the steamships meant fewer stops on ocean voyages. The great famine of the 1840's devastated the villages of West Cork, where the rough peninsular terrain impeded relief efforts. In our century, eager entrepreneurs overfished the lobster, crayfish and crab population around the Mizen and the Beara until the shellfish industry failed entirely.
No part of Ireland has been more transformed by waves of emigration from famine times to the present. The deserted village at Mizen Head is just one of many settlements abandoned by desperate emigrants fleeing to America or Australia or England. Shiploads of Irish men, women and children caught a last view of their native land as they steamed past the farflung outposts of West Cork -- Fastnet Rock and Brow Head, where a few older residents still remember watching their flight. Ironically, in recent times emigrants returning in large numbers for Christmas visits have created a lucrative winter tourist season, a welcome contribution to the precarious economy of the West.
Though history may have betrayed the promise of West Cork's riches, it jealously preserved the land for the eye and the camera. Today the profits of a modest tourist industry, coastal contours that are ideal for yachting and the region's growing popularity as a summer home for foreigners enable this generation of West Corkers to make a living in one of Ireland's most appealing and least crowded corners.
Tours of West Cork usually begin at the busy market town of Skibbereen, which dominates the region's business and tourist industry and has an Irish Tourist Board office as well as comfortable hotels and restaurants. But the special character of the ring routes depends on the proximity of the sea, and accommodations at Schull, Bantry or Glengarriff are situated near the main cross-peninsular routes and overlook the peaceful bays dotted with sailboats and trawlers.
The one-hour drive from Skibbereen to Schull passes through rolling countryside criss-crossed with hedges and into the tiny hillside village of Ballydehob, a handful of brightly painted shop fronts. Perched above an estuary that changes its shape with the tides, Ballydehob looks out on a 12-arch railway bridge built in the late 19th century to carry passengers, copper and fish during one of West Cork's promising periods. Abandoned in 1947, the bridge is now a pedestrian walkway overgrown with wildflowers -- an eloquent testimony to the changing fortunes of this now sparsely populated region.
From Ballydehob, the road winds around the base of Mount Gabriel to Schull, the gateway to the Mizen Ring and one of Ireland's loveliest seaside villages. Once referred to along with Skibbereen as "those two famine-slain sisters of the South," today Schull combines the sparkle of a yachting port with casual but comfortable tourist amenities and easy access to all of West Cork. Schull's southerly view encompasses the harbor, the large Roaringwater Bay beyond, Clear Island (birthplace of St. Kieran and still an Irish-speaking community), Long Island and Calf Island in a tapestry of shapes created by land and water and colored by the rapidly changing weather patterns that sweep across Ireland from this southwestern point. In the summer, a series of annual racing fixtures attracts sailors from all over the world, and during Schull's Calves Week Regatta in mid-August, the pubs and small family-run hotels along the village's main street burst with merriment and good-natured rivalry. During the short days of winter, the sun both rises and sets above the swatches of color and light in Roaringwater Bay, and a furious hailstorm is likely to be followed by a flood of sunshine and blue skies.
THE road from Schull toward Goleen and Mizen Head traces the crest of the peninsula through mounds of brush and rock daubed with the brilliant yellow flowers and spiny green branches of gorse. At Toormore, an inlet bends the road suddenly inward. Here the pastoral scene gives way to seascape as waves pour over jagged-toothed rocks, swirl into tidepools and splay out across the mudflats that line the shore. From Goleen the road turns to Crookhaven and a naturally protected harbor so typical of West Cork. The string of row houses painted in warm pastels -- apricot, yellow, salmon -- stands out against the deep green slope that stretches between Streek Head and Brow Head. This strategic site was once a thriving settlement in the heyday of the sailing ships, and it came alive again briefly with the discovery of copper and the resurgence of the fishing fleet. Marconi himself came to Crookhaven in 1902 to supervise the building of a radio transmission station at Brow Head, but the station was soon moved to a better location.
After Crookhaven, the Mizen Ring bends to the north and cuts across the stretch of land and water known as Barleycove, where layers of foamy breakers extend for hundreds of yards. The broad sandy strip -- the only beach for miles -- is backed by soft dunes and a tidal lake reaching far into the center of the peninsula. Flocks of oystercatchers and other wading birds wander the mudflats here at low tide, and the lake is fringed with tall rushes that are blown nearly flat by winter gales.
Just a few miles away, the wild seas and dramatic cliffs at Mizen Head seem a world apart from the shelter of Barleycove. The Anglo-Irish novelist Edith Somerville described this promontory as "a giant spoke of headland that sticks up like a boar's tusk above the rugged lip of the Irish coast." A safe, paved path dips down the face of the cliff to a white iron bridge that spans the inlet and connects to the Irish Lights Office on the Head; travelers wishing to venture out to the lighthouse must seek permission in advance. Many a doomed ship lies beneath the giant swells that batter these cliffs. At Three Castle Head you may leave your car at the road's end and walk down steps to within spray distance of breakers that arch high in the air before pummeling the rocks, or choose a more peaceful climb through fields to the three-towered O'Mahoney Castle, which has withstood nearly 800 years of violent weather and surf.
The northern stretch of the Mizen Ring route from Three Castle Head to Dunkelly, Dunmanus and Durrus follows a ridge overlooking sloping pastureland that ends abruptly in black rock plummeting to the sea. Layers of land and water -- Dunmanus Bay, Sheep's Head, Bantry Bay and the Ring of Beara -- line the horizon and appear and disappear as banks of fog, rain and clouds drift in from the sea. At Dunmanus, the massive walls of another O'Mahoney castle dominate the bay. The little peninsula to the north of the Mizen has several names -- Sheep's Head, Muntervary and Kilcrohane -- and a splendid ring route of its own. At the village of Ahakista the road plunges into tall woods in one of the lush, almost tropical settings that characterize West Cork. Farther along, a flourishing spring flower industry at Kilcrohane brightens the hillside with fields full of daffodils, tulips and irises. At Sheep's Head, an easy walk from the car park brings the visitor to a view that extends from Mizen Head to the Kerry mountains.
At Bantry, the roads from the Mizen and from Sheep's Head converge on Bantry House, a grand Georgian mansion overlooking the ample proportions of the bay. Filled with treasures of art, the house opened to the public in 1945 -- the first such house in Ireland to do so. The present heir, a descendant of the White family that has owned the house since 1750, runs the tours, teas and bed and breakfast business that enable him to keep up with the demands of maintaining and gradually restoring the magnificent house and grounds: Bantry House's 52 chimneys attest to the monumental nature of that task. The Whites living here in 1796 must have stood on their wide terrace gazing fearfully at the hostile French fleet that waited in the bay, poised to invade Cork in one of Wolfe Tone's ill-fated attempts to liberate Ireland with assistance from abroad. Once again, West Cork eluded the outsider. The road from Bantry to the Ring of Beara winds around to Glengarriff, a hospitable town, and the Eccles Hotel. At Glengarriff, boats leave regularly for nearby Garinish Island, one of several exotic island gardens in the mild West Cork climate. The coast road from Glengarriff to Adrigole dips in and out of deep forest, affording glimpses of more islands, inlets, bits of lakes -- a lantern show of scenery. The twists and turns of the coastline here provided cover for generations of pirates and other outlaws.
ON the Beara, the massive mountains of the Caha range fill the central part of the peninsula, dividing Cork from Kerry to the north and creating an atmosphere of grandeur in contrast to the intimacy of the Mizen and Muntervary peninsulas. Between Adrigole and Casteltownbere, Hungry Hill towers above all the other peaks. The copper mines in the area caught the fancy of many an entrepreneur, but following the pattern of other mines throughout West Cork, they failed to fulfill their promise and closed one after another when better sources of copper were discovered in Africa. Daphne du Maurier chronicled the story of these mines in her novel "Hungry Hill," which was inspired by the dealings of the notorious Puxley family, Welsh settlers who came to the Beara to seek their fortune.
Castletownbere, also called Castletown Bearhaven, lies at the entrance to Bantry Bay on yet another sheltered harbor. A headquarters for the Irish fishing fleet, this town has managed to re-establish itself as a commercial center in spite of its isolation. The bustling waterfront is lined with bars, tackle shops and small factories. Travelers following the Ring route may cut across the Beara at Castletownbere for spectacular mountain scenery, or drive out past the ruins of Dunboy Castle -- scene of a famous siege by the English in 1602 -- past Black Ball Head and Crow Head to the peninsula's tip, where Ireland's only cable car crosses a dangerous sound to Dursey Island. This squall-lashed island is one of Ireland's bleakest points -- the tiny villages and livestock seem to cling to its steep slopes -- but mountain walks here afford breathtaking views of Cork and Kerry and the sea.
The north-facing stretches of the West Cork peninsulas are quieter and more austere than those that face south; the rocky northern slopes of the Beara roll majestically seaward, broken by a few scattered cottages, stone circles or boulder burial sites from the Megalithic period, and abandoned mines, some of which are hundreds of years old. All the guidebooks warn hikers to beware of hidden shafts.
The Ring of Beara curves northward around Coulagh Bay at Ballydonegan and Allihies -- where the ruins of a 19th-century Cornish copper mining settlement still stand complete with engine houses -- and eastward along the mouth of the Kenmare River, plunging suddenly down into the village of Eyeries, its garishly painted houses visible from high in the mountains. After Ardgroom, Cork gives way to Kerry. Travelers can choose whether to traverse the Caha Mountains at the Healy Pass or by the slightly longer tunnel route from Kenmare to Glengarriff: both passes intersect a web of hiking routes that span the peninsula's swollen center.

COBBLESTONE LEADERSHIP
Majority Rule, Minority Power.
By James MacGregor Burns
with L. Marvin Overby.
University of Oklahoma, $17.95. 
 This study, "Cobblestone Leadership," written with L. Marvin Overby, who teaches political science at Loyola University, is an expansion of a series of lectures the Pulitzer Prize-winning scholar James MacGregor Burns gave in 1987 on how to make democratic government more effective. His premise is that the United States actually has adopted seven "bills of rights." The first was the Bill of Rights set forth in the first 10 amendments to the Constitution, which guaranteed that particular liberties of certain citizens would be free from government interference. The others he cites include the emancipation of slaves, women's suffrage and the economic rights that underlay the New Deal. Every expansion of rights has created a new class of people entitled to protection, Mr. Burns argues, but has also increased the tension between majority rule and minority rights. This, coupled with the checks and balances that the Founders built into the Constitution, has created a government that cannot govern effectively, a government of "stalemate and spasm." Mr. Burns's historical analysis is thoughtful and incisive. His suggestions -- strengthening political parties and amending the Constitution to strengthen them -- are, in the face of a declining civic culture together with immense corporate power, perhaps more in the nature of philosophical musings than practical solutions.

HEADLINE: THEATER;
A New Company Promises a New Voice

BYLINE: By ALVIN KLEIN

DATELINE: RUTHERFORD

 BODY:
WITH theaters in attrition, the arts in crisis and the economy in recession, what sort of time is this for a new professional theater company to be springing up?
"We're not thinking about all that," said Steven Bloom, who with William MacNeil is co-founder and co-artistic director of the Rivoli Stage Company, the new resident company of the William Carlos Williams Center for the Arts. "We're taking a chance. Our voice is different and we're not doing what others are doing. And our unique position makes it worthwhile to attempt." 
 For a first hearing of that voice, the company is producing the United States premiere of a double bill of monodramas called "Wild Abandon, Plus" by a 29-year-old Canadian playwright, Daniel MacIvor.
In an unusual case of reverse routing, the play has had six tryout performances at the Westbeth Theater Center in Manhattan before opening at the Williams Center for four performances that began last Thursday and end with a matinee today at 3 P.M. (The telephone number for ticket information is201-939-6969.)
The Rivoli's regular season is to begin with "Dog Eat Dog" by Mary Gallagher (Nov. 7 to Nov. 24), a play about three prosperous couples learning how to cope with being broke during hard times. It was produced at the Hartford Stage Company in 1983.
The second slot, from March 12 to March 29, is to be filled by John Guare's "Bosoms and Neglect" or Oliver Hailey's "I Won't Dance." The first is a mordant comedy about a terminally ill mother and her son's embattled marriage; the second is about a paraplegic's violent streak. Both were Broadway failures, running, respectively, for two days (in 1979) and for one day (in 1981).
The one to be selected is to be determined by audience response to "semistaged readings" -- of Mr. Hailey's work on July 15; of Mr. Guare's, on July 29. Both will be at 7:30 P.M. and are free to the public.
Obviously, mainstream theater is not within the mission of the Rivoli, which, fearing legal repercussions, isn't going by its name of first choice -- Serious Fun. That name has been taken by Lincoln Center's five-year-old arts festival, which starts July 11.
Still, "a theater of serious fun" is how the Rivoli explains what it is about in publicity releases. This refers, Mr. MacNeil said, to "plays that entertain -- and deal with issues, giving audiences something to think about."
For starters, the company's current double bill is more serious than fun. In the first of the two plays, "See Bob Run," a young woman named Roberta, the Bob of the title (played by Jessica Pennington) is a victim of sexual abuse by her father, who calls her Princess. She hitchhikes across Canada, moving from car to car. This is represented by four chairs on stage. When she walks atop them, they become rocks over the water, into which Bob gets ready to jump.
In the second play, "Wild Abandon," an alienated young man, Steve (played by Marc Battista), looks at a noose and says, "This is my option," but his fate is left up to the audience.
"Both plays are desperate cries for help from young people scarred by dysfunctional families, but the second play really is funny," Mr. MacNeil said.
Mr. Bloom said, "The characters are on a journey -- that's the key word I've been using with the actors." He is also the play's director.
"They're actively trying to find answers, not feeling sorry for themselves," Mr. Bloom said. "They're not just accepting or wallowing. They're making a real effort and they want to know and to be better and to be loved -- and that's what I find enriching and very theatrical."
The new company came to be when Mr. MacNeil, an Edgewater resident who said he was "closer to 50 than I want to be," was asked by Jack Banning to head a resident theater at the Williams Center. Mr. MacNeil had been associate artistic director of the Playhouse at the Park in Union City.
Mr. Banning, who is the Williams Center's executive director, had been the artistic director of the Playhouse at the Park. Mr. Bloom, a 35-year-old director, heard of the plans and invited both men to see one of his Off Off Broadway productions.
"The three of us were on the same wavelength about the kinds of plays we wanted to do," Mr. Bloom said.
Mr. Bloom, who was the assistant director of "Lend Me a Tenor" in the national touring production and the Paper Mill Playhouse version in Millburn, has worked in directing and theater management "all over the country," he said.
"As a professional director," he said, "I prefer to work in my back yard -- Guttenberg, where I live, is 15 minutes from Rutherford -- and at the same time, we can create a theater for the community."
Mr. MacNeil added, "Only American Stage in Teaneck is nearby -- about seven miles -- and we can fill the void left by the demise of the Whole Theater in Montclair, which was four miles away."
About the Rivoli's beginnings, Mr. MacNeil said, "Instead of waiting, we wanted to start small." The current production, which he said cost "between three and four thousand dollars," was financed by Mr. Bloom and Mr. MacNeil.
"We have two Equity actors and one Equity stage manager," Mr. MacNeil said. "The set consists of two paintings, which were lent to us, and the sound designer worked gratis."
Various fund-raising events are scheduled to finance the fall season, which is budgeted at more than $40,000, Mr. MacNeil said.
Mr. Bloom, explaining what he called the company's "unique position," said: "We're creating a relationship with the center, which offered us a brand new home, so we don't have to raise money to build a theater, and they're gaining the prestige of having a professional theater company here. And we split the costs. "We raised the money to produce; they get a portion of the box office -- and we don't have to worry about real estate. In New York, that's what it all winds up being about. All of our fund-raising is for money to go into our productions."
The Rivoli Theater, a movie house built in 1922, was devastated by a fire in the 1970's. It has been divided into two performing spaces, one of which is a "black box," with flexible seating arrangements (capacity: 300). Private and corporate donations totaled $100,00 for this space, which is where the new company is playing.
The other space is a 600-seat theater that is being renovated at a cost of $250,000. It is scheduled to open as a showplace for ballet and popular and classical concerts in October.
About the new company, Mr. Bloom said: "The plays are not only serious fun; they're being discovered -- or rediscovered."

Make the Free-Trade Vision a Reality

BYLINE: By RICHARD E. FEINBERG and PETER HAKIM; Richard E. Feinberg is executive vice president of the Overseas Development Council, Washington. Peter Hakim is staff director of the Inter-American Dialogue, Washington.

 BODY:
With the end of the Cold War, trade has displaced security as the centerpiece of relations between the United States and Latin America.. Yet there is not one organization with the mandate and expertise to exercise leadership on inter-American trade issues. This is a vacuum that now should be filled by the governments of the Americas.
President Bush set off a flurry of activity a year ago, when he put forth the vision of a Western Hemisphere free-trade area. Country after country in Latin America declared interest in free trade with the United States -- and six have signed bilateral or multilateral "framework agreements" with Washington providing for regular discussion on key issues. The proposal has also reinvigorated existing trade pacts throughout Latin America; prompted Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay to work toward a common market, and spurred other nations to begin free-trade talks. All this activity surely will accelerate now that fast-track authority for United States trade negotiations has been renewed. 
 This, then, is the time for the United States and other governments to create, with the private sector, an Americas Commission for Trade and Trade-Related Matters. It would help promote unrestricted hemispheric commerce, serving as:
* A clearinghouse, to collect, systematize and disseminate trade statistics and information on national trade policies;
* A think tank, to analyze trade and trade-related issues;
* A trade monitor, to review and evaluate proposed trade arrangements among nations, and
* A source of technical assistance, to provide expertise to countries formulating trade policies and negotiating trade agreements.
Over time, the commission could be entrusted with the more sensitive tasks of defining rules to guide hemispheric trade negotiations, mediating them, investigating alleged violations of trade accords and settling disputes. It could be set up within an established institution like the Inter-American Development Bank or as a free-standing agency.
Trade is now reshaping hemispheric relations. Expanding commerce could help create a Western Hemisphere economic community along European lines. But burgeoning trade could, just as easily, produce new conflicts in the Americas, as it has in relations between Washington and Tokyo. An effective hemispheric trade organization could help prevent this by injecting order and purpose into the current mosaic of trade negotiations. With some imagination and a small investment by hemispheric governments -- no more than $10 million a year -- the Americas Commission for Trade could be up and running in short order.

HEADLINE: The Executive Life;
Dirty Shirts at the 6:18, Clean Collars Tonight

BYLINE: By Nancy Marx Better

 BODY:
It's 6:18 on a Tuesday morning, and the Greenwich, Conn., train station is bustling. Cars drop off sleepy-eyed commuters, who dash to the newsstand, coins and monogrammed briefcases in hand, before heading to the Manhattan-bound platform.
 Some commuters, however, carry something more. James Carrier, a salesman with Reuters Information Services, races in with an armful of crumpled shirts. "No starch," he blurts to an attendant at the blue-and-white booth just inside the station's entrance. "See you tonight." 
When Mr. Carrier returns 12 hours later, his fresh-pressed shirts will be waiting, done by Commuter Cleaners, a four-year-old service that has grown to seven outlets -- at railroad stations and in small shops -- in suburban Westchester County and Connecticut. "It used to be that I could never get to my cleaners except on weekends," Mr. Carrier said. "This is much more convenient."
 Commuter Cleaners is the brainchild of Paul McDonald, a 31-year-old former accountant who got fed up with working long hours and commuting -- and never having a clean shirt as a result. His early efforts involved standing outside the Greenwich station with a laundry basket, offering to ferry commuters' clothes back and forth from local cleaning shops. Today he runs a $1 million business with 20 employees, a fleet of vans and his own production plant. It is, to the best of his knowledge, the only such service in the country, and he also offers tailoring and shoe repair.
 "Our concept is to attract the time-sensitive customer," Mr. McDonald explained. "These people spend 40 hours a month on the train. Anything they can do to save a little leisure time is a big help."
 Operating a cleaner along one of the nation's chief power corridors means Mr. McDonald sees some unusual dirty laundry. Take the morning Tom Sexton, manager of the fixed-income department at First Boston, left a pair of golf slacks at the Greenwich station. During the cleaning, a money clip turned up -- with more than $1,000 in cash. "He gave our driver a pretty big tip when he found it waiting," said Mr. McDonald.
 Another time, a prominent executive -- whom Mr. McDonald won't identify -- arrived with his wife. When he dumped his clothes on the counter, a peep show token rolled out of a pocket. "He told his wife he found it on the street, that it was a coin from another country," recalled Mr. McDonald.
 Until 1987, Mr. McDonald had had little experience with either commuting or cleaning. The Oklahoma-bred entrepreneur earned an M.B.A. from Tulane University in New Orleans, then took a job with Arthur Andersen there. When the regional economy headed south, he headed north to Creditanstalt Bankverein, an Austrian bank with offices in midtown Manhattan. He settled in Westchester, and for 18 months commuted to his job as an account supervisor.
 "There's a lot of time on the train to sit and ponder your future," he said.
 Armed with demographic statistics from Metro-North, Mr. McDonald did a market analysis of commuters using the New Haven and the Harlem-Hudson lines. He started his service in Greenwich because it had the right station configuration. "You need to get customers between their cars and the train," he says. "It helps if they all come through the same entrance."
 He negotiated for a lease on the Greenwich (there are also Old Greenwich and Cos Cob stops) station, from a private real estate company; later, in Stamford and Chappaqua, two other station sites, he had to win approval from the municipalities.
 To insure success with customers, he undercut local services, charging $1.50 a shirt instead of $2. Because his business required only low overhead -- a few feet of space in the station and a truck to transport the clothes, which were processed at a low bulk rate by local cleaning plants in their downtime -- he turned a profit in his first month. (Recently, he raised shirt prices to $1.75, to cover the cost of his production plant.)
 Metro-North's research suggests that more than 60 percent of the area's commuters are men, but Mr. McDonald is trying to woo women, too; their clothes are more expensive to clean, generating higher profit margins, and they are highly appreciative of his service. "With two-career couples, convenience becomes a major issue," says Molly Ingram, director of consumer promotion programs for Cahners Publishing, who commutes from Greenwich. "This has made things much easier for us."
 But some of Mr. McDonald's best customers aren't commuters at all. Two years ago, he added home delivery, and makes pickups and deliveries twice a week. He now also has four small shops in Westchester to soak up his cleaning plant's additional capacity. His storefront customers include the likes of Carl Icahn, who has been seen dashing from his car with dirty shirts in hand. But Mr. McDonald would not air customers' dirty laundry -- or at least the names of the owners of said dirty laundry -- for publication.
 There are still a few kinks to smooth out, such as how to deal with executives who want to drop off shirts in Chappaqua and pick them up in Stamford. But plans are underway to expand this fall into three more stations and Mr. McDonald is considering other sites. "Imagine Long Island," he said, eyes gleaming. "The Huntington station alone has 5,000 commuters a day. Think of all those shirts."
