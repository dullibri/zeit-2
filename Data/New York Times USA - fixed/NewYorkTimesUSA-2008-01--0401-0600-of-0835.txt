HEADLINE: State of the City Could Be a Campaign Speech, Too

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN. 
E-mail: haberman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
As the setting for his latest State of the City speech, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg chose a new swimming pool and ice-skating rink complex in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, Queens.
 ''I was hoping to ride in on a Zamboni,'' the mayor joked on Thursday to a friendly audience of government officials and political allies, ''but I couldn't get it through the Midtown Tunnel.''
 Too bad. It would have been a perfect machine for him. The fevered speculation about his political intentions is a lot like a Zamboni: It keeps resurfacing. 
 Nothing that Mr. Bloomberg said in his 48-minute address will end the guessing games about him and the presidential race, never mind his repeated ''I am not a candidate'' protestations. They merely describe momentary reality, not what he may be planning.
 You could read Thursday's speech any which way you want.
 On one level, it was a bread-and-butter recitation of what Mr. Bloomberg saw as his accomplishments and what he hoped to do in the two years he has left at City Hall: with policing and fire protection, education, health, housing, economic development and so on.
 But there was another level, and it practically screamed, ''Hey, don't rule me out in 2008.'' His constant travels -- the schedule this weekend puts him in California and Texas, two states dripping with electoral votes -- can only feed assumptions that he is toying with a third-party candidacy.
 He wasted little time on Thursday to slip in the buzzword of the year: change. All the presidential candidates say they want to be change agents so badly that the eventual losers might think about looking for work in a movie theater box office.
 For himself, Mr. Bloomberg suggested he would be better at innovation than the others. ''We can improve and be the beneficiary of change, not its victim,'' he said.
 As expected, he said he wanted to avoid raising taxes to balance a city budget that has a projected deficit of $3.1 billion for the fiscal year starting July 1. Like the rest of the country, New York is headed for rocky financial times. But his druthers, the mayor said, are to tighten belts, not fiddle with taxes.
 Let's see, what is something that you definitely do not want to do if you are contemplating a presidential race?
 WAIT, wait, don't tell me.
 I got it: You don't ask for higher taxes. And how nice it must be to be able to count on compliant partners like the city comptroller, the public advocate, the City Council speaker and the City Council Finance Committee chairman -- all of whom face term limits and are shopping around for new jobs. The last thing any of them wishes to be called is a tax hiker.
 An ice-skating rink, where hockey games will presumably be played, was a splendid setting for Mr. Bloomberg on other issues. His elbows were flying. They were aimed, in particular, at his former mates in the Republican Party, which he abandoned last year.
 With five families from various corners of the world sitting behind him on the stage, he denounced ''those who are wailing against immigration'' and ''those politicians who, all of a sudden, have embraced xenophobia.'' That ''all of a sudden'' line may well have been meant for his immediate predecessor, Rudolph W. Giuliani, who was most friendly to illegal immigrants when he was mayor but now raises an iron fist at them.
 ''I say: Open your eyes,'' Mr. Bloomberg said. ''Take a look behind me. This is what makes America great. This is New York City. This is freedom. This is compassion and democracy and opportunity.''
 There was absolutely no affection for Mr. Giuliani in Mr. Bloomberg's observation that before the present mayoralty, city government was ''insular and provincial, and married to the conventional.'' Ditto for his shout-outs to former Mayors Edward I. Koch and David N. Dinkins, who were in the audience. 
 Mr. Giuliani, whose endorsement helped Mr. Bloomberg win the 2001 election, got nary a mention.
 Not that Democrats got a kiss from the born-again independent at City Hall. He called for a ''nonpartisan coalition'' to change the Board of Elections, now in the clutches of what he called Boss Tweed-style ''party bosses,'' Democrats and Republicans alike.
 This was Mr. Bloomberg's seventh State of the City address. He was unsure of himself when he delivered his ''first one of these,'' he said, but now ''I'm particularly looking forward to the next one.''
 His wording did not make it at all clear if he was referring to his eighth and last State of the City speech or his first State of Something Else.

HEADLINE: We're All Gonna Die! Grab Your Video Camera!

BYLINE: By MANOHLA DARGIS

 BODY:
It was only last month that Will Smith started up boogeyman patrol in Manhattan in ''I Am Legend,'' and yet here we go again with the end of the world, or at least some of the city's most exclusive ZIP codes. This time, the annihilation comes courtesy of a reptilian creature with a slithering, smashing tail, multiple grabby appendages and an apparently insatiable appetite for destruction. At one point in ''Cloverfield'' you get a close, very personal look at that hungry mouth, which agape recalls that of the adult monster designed by H. R. Giger for the first ''Alien,'' though without any of the older beastie's freakily sexualized menace or resonance. 
 Like ''Cloverfield'' itself, this new monster is nothing more than a blunt instrument designed to smash and grab without Freudian complexity or political critique, despite the tacky allusions to Sept. 11. The screams and the images of smoke billowing through the canyons of Lower Manhattan may make you think of the attack, and you may curse the filmmakers for their vulgarity, insensitivity or lack of imagination. (The director, Matt Reeves, lives in Los Angeles, as does the writer, Drew Goddard, and the movie's star producer, J. J. Abrams.) But the film is too dumb to offend anything except your intelligence, and the monster does cut a satisfying swath through the cast, so your only complaint may be, What took it so long?
 As it happens, ''Cloverfield'' clocks in at 84 minutes, a running time that includes the usual interminable final credits. The movie moves relatively fast, though it's nowhere near as economical as its colossus, whose thunderous shrieks and fiery projectiles bring a downtown loft party to a merciful, abrupt end. The loft belongs to a blandly pretty young thing named Rob (Michael Stahl-David), who, on the eve of relocating to Japan for work, has been thrown a farewell party by some other blandly pretty young things. The names we're meant to remember are those of Rob's brother, Jason (Mike Vogel), and Jason's insignificant other, Lily (Jessica Lucas); a bored, boring single, Marlena (Lizzy Caplan); and Rob's nitwit buddy, Hud (T. J. Miller), who has been recruited to videotape the party. 
 ''Cloverfield'' is nominally a monster movie, but mostly it's a feature-length gimmick. It opens with some official-looking United States government text claiming that the following images were retrieved from what was once known as Central Park. The big (or rather only) idea here is that almost everything we subsequently see is the presumably unedited video material shot by Hud, who, though initially reluctant to pick up the camera, develops a mania for documentation once the monster strikes. So consummate is his dedication to his version of cinema verite that he keeps the camera plugged to his eye even while he's running through hailstorms of debris, trying to cross a fast-collapsing bridge and witnessing friends melt down, bleed out and even die. 
 For a brief, hopeful moment, I thought the filmmakers might be making a point about how the contemporary compulsion to record the world has dulled us to actual lived experience, including the suffering of others -- you know, something about the simulacrum syndrome in the post-Godzilla age at the intersection of the camera eye with the narcissistic ''I.'' Certainly this straw-grasping seemed the most charitable way to explain characters whose lack of personality (''This is crazy, dude!'') is matched only by their incomprehensible stupidity. Smart as Tater Tots and just as differentiated, Rob and his ragtag crew behave like people who have never watched a monster movie or the genre-savvy ''Scream'' flicks or even an episode of ''Lost'' (Hello, Mr. Abrams!), much less experienced the real horrors of Sept. 11. 
 And, so, much like a character from a crummy movie, Rob hears from an estranged lover, Beth (Odette Yustman), who, after the attack, begs for help on her miraculously working cellphone. Against the odds and a crush of fleeing humanity, he tries to rescue her (unbelievably, ludicrously, the others tag along), which is meant to show what a good guy he is. But heroism without a fully realized hero proves as much a dead end as subjective camerawork that's executed without a discernible subjectivity. Like too many big-studio productions, ''Cloverfield'' works as a showcase for impressively realistic-looking special effects, a realism that fails to extend to the scurrying humans whose fates are meant to invoke pity and fear but instead inspire yawns and contempt. 
 Rarely have I rooted for a monster with such enthusiasm. 
 ''Cloverfield'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Monster violence and bloody wounds.
 CLOVERFIELD

HEADLINE: Confederate Flag Takes Center Stage Once Again

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER; Michael Luo and Michael Powell contributed reporting from Columbia, S.C.

DATELINE: COLUMBIA, S.C. 

 BODY:
The Republican presidential candidates on Thursday moved to appeal to different types of conservative voters before the South Carolina primary, with Mike Huckabee using colorful language to declare the Confederate flag a states' rights issue and Senator John McCain embracing a supply-side tax cut proposal. 
 ''You don't like people from outside the state coming in and telling you what to do with your flag,'' Mr. Huckabee, a former governor of Arkansas, told supporters in Myrtle Beach, according to The Associated Press. 
 ''In fact,'' he said, ''if somebody came to Arkansas and told us what to do with our flag, we'd tell them what to do with the pole; that's what we'd do.''
 At a news conference on Thursday night, he said, ''It is not an issue the president of the United States needs to weigh in on.'' Mr. Huckabee, who did not say whether he considered it offensive to fly the Confederate battle flag, made his remarks as he toured the state with David Beasley, a former South Carolina governor, who had angered some conservatives by removing the flag from the Capitol dome in Columbia and displaying it elsewhere on the Capitol grounds.
 And a radio advertisement paid for by an independent group used the flag issue to attack Mr. McCain, of Arizona, and praise Mr. Huckabee. ''John McCain assaults our values,'' it said. ''Mike Huckabee understands the value of heritage.''
 Mr. McCain unveiled a tax-cut plan here in Columbia with a speech that was designed to reassure voters worried about the economy as well as fiscal conservatives who have been wary of him ever since he initially opposed President Bush's tax cuts. Many who voted Tuesday in the Michigan primary, which Mitt Romney won, listed economic anxieties as their top concern. 
 Campaigning with Jack F. Kemp, the former quarterback, congressman, vice-presidential nominee in 1996 and proponent of supply-side economics, Mr. McCain called for cutting the corporate tax rate to 25 percent from 35 percent -- which Rudolph W. Giuliani has also called for -- as well as making Mr. Bush's tax cuts permanent, establishing a tax credit for research and development, and repealing the alternative minimum tax. 
 And Mr. McCain proclaimed himself a believer in the notion that cutting taxes increases revenue for the government by spurring economic growth. ''Don't listen to this siren song about cutting taxes,'' Mr. McCain told supporters gathered here under a tent in a driving rain. ''Every time in history we have raised taxes it has cut revenues. And is there anybody here that needs to have their taxes increased?''
 The campaign did not put a dollar figure on the cost of the tax cut. Asked later how he would pay for it, Mr. McCain said that he would start by eliminating pork-barrel spending.
 Mr. McCain also sounded a skeptical note about the short-term stimulus plans that are being weighed in Washington and by some Democratic candidates. 
 ''My friends, you're going to hear from the Democrats, Let's pump $70 billion, let's pump $80 billion, let's do this, let's do that,'' he said. ''My friends, remember who is going to pay that. It doesn't come off a printing press. It comes out of your pockets.''
 The Romney campaign questioned Mr. McCain's plan, and continued their efforts to paint him as a Washington insider. ''So after almost three decades spent on Capitol Hill and after joining with Democrats to vote against the Bush tax-relief plans not once but twice, Senator McCain all of a sudden wants to try and help the economy work?'' asked Kevin Madden, a Romney spokesman.
 And Mr. Romney, before leaving South Carolina for Nevada, seemed to leave the door open for sending out tax rebate checks to jump-start the economy. ''I do believe it makes sense for Congress to take immediate action,'' said Mr. Romney, a former governor of Massachusetts, adding that he would release a plan soon. 
 Mr. Romney got into an unusually heated exchange with Glen Johnson, an Associated Press reporter, at a news conference at a Staples store in Columbia. Mr. Johnson challenged Mr. Romney when he asserted he did not have lobbyists running his campaign. Mr. Johnson cited Ronald C. Kaufman, a senior adviser who is a Washington lobbyist.
 The two got into a testy back and forth, with Mr. Romney saying Mr. Kaufman was not ''even in on the senior strategy meetings'' of the campaign and angrily taking on the reporter.
 The Confederate flag issue -- while not as prominent as it was in 2000 -- has continued to surface. Fred D. Thompson, the former Tennessee senator who is staking his campaign on a strong showing here, said at a debate in November that ''for a great many Americans, it's a symbol of racism'' and added that he was ''glad that people have made a decision not to display it as a prominent flag symbolic of something in a state capitol.'' 
 Mr. McCain, who has cited his own equivocations on the issue in 2000 as one of his failures of political courage, was met at several stops by flag-waving protesters. Asked about the flag at an event on Wednesday in Spartanburg, Mr. McCain said, ''My answer, sir, is that I could not be more proud that the overwhelming majority of the people of this state joined together taking that flag off the top of the....'' And his answer was drowned out by the cheers of supporters.

HEADLINE: Don't Cry for Me, America

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Mexico. Brazil. Argentina. Mexico, again. Thailand. Indonesia. Argentina, again. 
 And now, the United States.
 The story has played itself out time and time again over the past 30 years. Global investors, disappointed with the returns they're getting, search for alternatives. They think they've found what they're looking for in some country or other, and money rushes in. 
 But eventually it becomes clear that the investment opportunity wasn't all it seemed to be, and the money rushes out again, with nasty consequences for the former financial favorite. That's the story of multiple financial crises in Latin America and Asia. And it's also the story of the U.S. combined housing and credit bubble. These days, we're playing the role usually assigned to third-world economies. 
 For reasons I'll explain later, it's unlikely that America will experience a recession as severe as that in, say, Argentina. But the origins of our problem are pretty much the same. And understanding those origins also helps us understand where U.S. economic policy went wrong.
 The global origins of our current mess were actually laid out by none other than Ben Bernanke, in an influential speech he gave early in 2005, before he was named chairman of the Federal Reserve. Mr. Bernanke asked a good question: ''Why is the United States, with the world's largest economy, borrowing heavily on international capital markets -- rather than lending, as would seem more natural?''
 His answer was that the main explanation lay not here in America, but abroad. In particular, third world economies, which had been investor favorites for much of the 1990s, were shaken by a series of financial crises beginning in 1997. As a result, they abruptly switched from being destinations for capital to sources of capital, as their governments began accumulating huge precautionary hoards of overseas assets.
 The result, said Mr. Bernanke, was a ''global saving glut'': lots of money, all dressed up with nowhere to go.
 In the end, most of that money went to the United States. Why? Because, said Mr. Bernanke, of the ''depth and sophistication of the country's financial markets.''
 All of this was right, except for one thing: U.S. financial markets, it turns out, were characterized less by sophistication than by sophistry, which my dictionary defines as ''a deliberately invalid argument displaying ingenuity in reasoning in the hope of deceiving someone.'' E.g., ''Repackaging dubious loans into collateralized debt obligations creates a lot of perfectly safe, AAA assets that will never go bad.''
 In other words, the United States was not, in fact, uniquely well-suited to make use of the world's surplus funds. It was, instead, a place where large sums could be and were invested very badly. Directly or indirectly, capital flowing into America from global investors ended up financing a housing-and-credit bubble that has now burst, with painful consequences. 
 As I said, these consequences probably won't be as bad as the devastating recessions that racked third-world victims of the same syndrome. The saving grace of America's situation is that our foreign debts are in our own currency. This means that we won't have the kind of financial death spiral Argentina experienced, in which a falling peso caused the country's debts, which were in dollars, to balloon in value relative to domestic assets.
 But even without those currency effects, the next year or two could be quite unpleasant.
 What should have been done differently? Some critics say that the Fed helped inflate the housing bubble with low interest rates. But those rates were low for a good reason: although the last recession officially ended in November 2001, it was another two years before the U.S. economy began delivering convincing job growth, and the Fed was rightly concerned about the possibility of Japanese-style prolonged economic stagnation. 
 The real sin, both of the Fed and of the Bush administration, was the failure to exercise adult supervision over markets running wild. 
 It wasn't just Alan Greenspan's unwillingness to admit that there was anything more than a bit of ''froth'' in housing markets, or his refusal to do anything about subprime abuses. The fact is that as America's financial system has grown ever more complex, it has also outgrown the framework of banking regulations that used to protect us -- yet instead of an attempt to update that framework, all we got were paeans to the wonders of free markets.
 Right now, Mr. Bernanke is in crisis-management mode, trying to deal with the mess his predecessor left behind. I don't have any problems with his testimony yesterday, although I suspect that it's already too late to prevent a recession.
 But let's hope that when the dust settles a bit, Mr. Bernanke takes the lead in talking about what needs to be done to fix a financial system gone very, very wrong.

HEADLINE: British Group Suspends Work Of Offices in 2 Russian Cities

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL; C. J. Chivers contributed reporting from Moscow.

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
A government-financed British cultural organization said Thursday that it had suspended operations in two Russian cities, accusing the Russian security police and tax authorities of harassing members of its local staff by summoning them for interrogation, sometimes late at night in their homes.
 ''We saw similar actions during the cold war, but thought they had been put behind us,'' the British foreign secretary, David Miliband, told Parliament. 
 The move was the latest development in a deepening diplomatic standoff that has drawn in the European Union and the United States on Britain's side in a dispute with Russia over the operations of the British Council at its offices in St. Petersburg and Yekaterinburg.
 Russia has accused Britain of running its offices in those two cities illegally, asserting that the only authorized British Council office is in Moscow. The Russians had threatened late last year to close the two offices.
 When Britain refused to close them, officers of the F.S.B., which is the domestic successor to the K.G.B., and tax inspectors ''summoned over 20 Russian staff to attend individual interviews'' on Tuesday while ''10 members of staff were visited at home by the Russian tax police,'' Martin Davidson, the chief executive of the British Council, said in a statement Thursday.
 ''The interviews had little to do with their work and were clearly aimed at exerting undue pressure on innocent individuals,'' Mr. Davidson said. The Russian authorities, he said, had made it impossible to operate in St. Petersburg and Yekaterinburg, ''so I have taken the decision to suspend operations in both cities.''
 The dispute has its roots in the November 2006 killing in London of Alexander V. Litvinenko, a former K.G.B. and F.S.B. officer. Britain wants Russia to extradite Andrei K. Lugovoi, a former K.G.B. bodyguard, to face trial for the killing, but Russia has refused to comply and Mr. Lugovoi insists that he is innocent.
 The increasing strains between London and Moscow have elicited increasingly rancorous comments from both sides.
 In Parliament on Thursday, Mr. Miliband called Russia's actions ''reprehensible, not worthy of a great country,'' and said they raised serious questions about Russia's ''observance of international law as well as about the standards of behavior she is prepared to adopt toward her own citizens.''
 ''Russia has failed to show any legal reasons under Russian or international law why the British Council should not continue to operate,'' he said. Britain, he said, did not ''believe that cultural activities should become a political football.''
 ''That is why I have decided not to take similar action against Russia's cultural activities in the U.K.,'' Mr. Miliband said.
 In Russia, Mr. Lugovoi spoke against the British Council and defended Russia's actions. Mr. Lugovoi was elected last year to the Duma, the lower house of Parliament; he spoke in his capacity as a member of the committee for security.
 ''I am sure that there is no politics here and all the problems lie exclusively in the judicial sphere,'' he said. ''It's a matter of principle for Russia -- the British Council should observe the laws of the country in which it carries out its activity.''
 Another member of the Duma, Konstantin I. Kosachyov, also insisted that Russia had acted appropriately. ''Russia is not a banana republic,'' he said. ''We have legislation here.''
 The European Union said in a statement that it ''deeply regrets in particular the harassment of British Council staff as well as the administrative and other measures announced by the Russian authorities.''

HEADLINE: Mayor Hails City's Immigrants and Innovation

BYLINE: By DIANE CARDWELL; Al Baker contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, looking at once to close a multibillion-dollar deficit and burnish his national profile as an innovator, unveiled a mix of tough education and anticrime measures while embracing the virtues of immigration on Thursday at his annual State of the City address.
 At the heart of his speech, Mr. Bloomberg warned of the coming pain of spending cuts in response to lost revenues from Wall Street and a slowing real estate market. But he argued that the hurt would have been far worse if not for his careful management of the budget in recent years, and said he did not yet plan to raise taxes. 
 In the 48-minute address, Mr. Bloomberg vowed to end social promotion for eighth graders, as he already has for third, fifth and seventh graders. He called for collecting DNA from anyone arrested for a crime. And the mayor, a billionaire who paid for his own campaigns, promised to step up the fight against political patronage.
 The presentation, complete with lively performances by public school students and the mayor holding up a baby, was as political as it was practical, with Mr. Bloomberg working to keep the notion alive that he could become a third-party presidential candidate unencumbered by partisan allegiances and sniping. He was particularly explicit on immigration, an emotional issue in both the Democratic and Republican campaigns.
 ''Take a look behind me,'' Mr. Bloomberg said, referring to the collection of largely immigrant families he had invited to sit onstage. ''This is what makes America great,'' he added, holding his arms aloft, his voice rising. ''This is New York City. This is freedom. This is compassion and democracy and opportunity.''
 Indeed, Mr. Bloomberg practically began his address by jabbing a sly elbow toward some of the presidential candidates, criticizing those who had suddenly ''embraced xenophobia.''
 ''Keeping New York City and America at the front of the pack begins with an openness to new energy, meaning immigration, and new ideas, meaning innovation,'' he said. ''That's how I built my business, and that's the approach we've brought to a city government that was insular and provincial, and married to the conventional.''
 Again and again Mr. Bloomberg returned to the theme of rejecting received wisdom and changing the way government works, nowhere more clearly than in the public school system, whose improvement he has made a major part of his legacy. But in extending the end of social promotion to the eighth grade, Mr. Bloomberg seemed to tacitly acknowledge that despite his having toughened the promotion policies in earlier grades, too many students were still entering high school unprepared to succeed.
 To help struggling students who are preparing for the working world, Mr. Bloomberg said he would overhaul vocational education in the high schools and community colleges, beginning in September 2009. Toward that end, he announced the creation of a task force to be led by former Mayor David N. Dinkins and Sy Sternberg, chairman and chief executive of the New York Life Insurance Company, and to include Merryl H. Tisch, a philanthropist and member of the State Board of Regents.
 ''Traditionally, such career and technical education has been seen as an educational dead end,'' Mr. Bloomberg said. ''We're going to change that. College isn't for everyone, but education is.''
 Despite looming economic trouble, Mr. Bloomberg offered several political crowd-pleasers, like continuing a $400 property tax rebate and allowing online access to the 311 system, results from quality-of-life inspections, and other service data like fire response times and noise complaints.
 But at least one proposal, to collect DNA samples from anyone arrested for a crime in the city, could be less easy to sell, especially to state legislators, who took seven years to approve a similar provision for people who had been convicted of felonies and some misdemeanors.
 Federal law enforcement agencies and a few states already have similar provisions, which supporters say help identify repeat criminals and exonerate the innocent but have drawn opposition among privacy and prisoners' advocates.
 Peter J. Neufeld, the co-founder and co-director of the Innocence Project, a nonprofit organization that uses DNA evidence to exonerate the wrongfully convicted, criticized the proposal, saying the mayor was ''shooting from the hip.''
 ''The mayor's goal is laudable, but he is completely wrong about how to protect the innocent,'' said Mr. Neufeld, adding that blacks and Hispanics were disproportionately arrested by the police. ''The best ways to protect the innocent do not involve collecting DNA from arrestees, who are presumed innocent and many of whom will have their charges dismissed. The best way to protect the innocent is to change the way the N.Y.P.D. conducts identifications and fails to record interrogations.''
 Under the mayor's proposal, which would require state approval, if the DNA profiles of those arrested were not linked to other crimes and they were not convicted, their genetic records would be erased.
 Mr. Bloomberg also announced a less contentious DNA proposal: a ''six-figure prize'' for inventing a device that would allow the Police Department to more quickly and thoroughly analyze DNA at the scene of a crime. The prize, to be paid out of private donations, is ''just one more way we are trying to bring private-sector innovation into the public sector,'' he said.
 Throughout the address, the penultimate of his tenure, Mr. Bloomberg sought to show how he was paying off the promise of a chief executive as mayor, outlining the data-driven, efficiency-minded, anti-politics-as-usual approach he asserts he is bringing to government. 
 He said he would convene a charter revision commission to take a comprehensive look at the structure and operation of city agencies in order to eliminate redundancies and antiquated regulations while finding savings. 
 And he returned to a pet theme of getting the politics out of politics, pledging to work with Citizens Union, a good-government group, to lobby for nonpartisan hiring at the Board of Elections. In New York, election law requires that the members of each state and local board must be divided equally between the two major parties, according to the Citizens Union. As a result, Mr. Bloomberg said, party bosses call the shots. 
 Saying that 2008 is the 130th anniversary of the death of Boss Tweed, he added, ''Let's also make it the year we finally put to rest his style of politics.''

HEADLINE: Google's Searches Now Include Ways to Make a Better World

BYLINE: By HARRIET RUBIN

 BODY:
Google announced a plan on Thursday that begins to fulfill the pledge it made to investors when it went public nearly four years ago to reserve 1 percent of its profit and equity to ''make the world a better place.'' The beneficiaries of Google's money range from groups that are fighting disease to those developing a commercial plug-in car. 
 The company's philanthropy -- Google.org, or DotOrg as Googlers call it -- will spend up to $175 million in its first round of grants and investments over the next three years, Google officials said. While it is like other companies' foundations in making grants, it will also be untraditional in making for-profit investments, encouraging Google employees to participate directly and lobbying public officials for changes in policies, company officials said. 
 Google may be one of America's 10 richest corporations as measured by market value, but its budget for philanthropy is minuscule compared with the $70 billion of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. 
 Still, Google's founders, Sergey Brin and Larry Page, expressed a hope back in 2004 that ''someday this institution may eclipse Google itself in terms of overall world impact.'' What it lacks in size, though, Google.org may make up in cachet.
 Larry Brilliant, a medical doctor who took on the role of director of Google.org 18 months ago, said he could not even begin to count how many spending proposals he had seen. ''There are 6.5 billion people in the world,'' Dr. Brilliant said in a recent interview, ''and in the last 18 months I've met 6.4 billion, all of whom want, if not some of our money, then some of the Google pixie dust.'' 
 Dr. Brilliant, who moved to an ashram in northern India in the 1970s and went on to play a major role in eradicating smallpox in the country, likened his moral quandary in figuring out how to spend Google.org's money to that faced by a saint wandering the streets of Benares. 
 ''There are 500 steps between the road and the Ganges,'' he said. ''On every step are beggars, lepers, people who have no arms or legs, people literally starving. The saint has a couple of rupees; how does a good and honorable person make a resource allocation decision? Do you weigh a hand that's missing more than a leg? Someone who's starving versus a sick child? In a much less dramatic way, that's what the last 18 months have been for us.'' 
 DotOrg has focused on what it can do ''uniquely,'' said Sheryl Sandberg, vice president for global online sales and operations at Google, who, like all employees, is permitted to spend 20 percent of her time at the foundation or in other charitable ventures. ''If you do things other people could do, you're not adding value.'' 
 In contrast to DotOrg's close tie to DotCom, employees of Microsoft have made Mr. Gates wealthy but have no official influence in how the Gates Foundation money is spent. 
 The only urgency imposed on the foundation is how soon it can live up to the expectations. ''Building a new ecosystem is not an overnight phenomenon,'' Dr. Brilliant said. ''Here at Google if you have a project, you press Send. We won't work that quickly.''
 But for all the enthusiasm for the new organization, there are critics. ''It's wonderful that this company is devoting massive resources to fixing big world problems, but they are taking an engineer's perspective to them,'' said Siva Vaidhyanathan, a cultural historian and media scholar at the University of Virginia. ''Machines and software are not always the answer. Global problems arise from how humans have undervalued each other and miscommunicated with each other.''
 He pointed to Google.org's decision not to take a step like financing scholarships for girls in India who have not had access to education. ''That's what is so naive about Google.org's approach,'' he said. ''If you can educate a thousand girls in one state in India, you've already made a bigger difference than 99 percent of the human beings on earth because every one of those of girls can make a difference.''
 The process of determining what to finance was not easy, said Jacquelline Fuller, the head of advocacy at Google.org. Beginning in the spring of 2007, ''the 20 team members had 20 ideas.'' Team members, she said, ''debated, cried and held hands as we tried to determine what kind of difference we could make.'' It took them almost a year to winnow down the list.
 Although it was just announcing its initiatives on Thursday, Google.org has already begun to give away some of its money. 
 That is the case with grants for the first of its initiatives -- what the philanthropy calls ''predict and prevent.'' This effort focuses on strengthening early warning systems in countries around the world to detect a disease before it becomes pandemic, or a drought before it becomes a famine. 
 To attain that, DotOrg has made a grant of $5 million to a nonprofit group that Dr. Brilliant helped to set up, though it is independent from DotOrg. Called Instedd, for Innovative Support to Emergencies, Diseases and Disasters, the group seeks to improve data and communication networks. An additional $2.5 million has been awarded to the Global Health and Security Initiative to respond to biological threats in Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and China's Yunnan Province. 
 ''In recent years,'' Dr. Brilliant said, ''39 new communicable diseases with a potential to become pandemic have jumped species,'' including SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome; monkey pox and bird flu. 
 ''What if we could have been there when the H.I.V. moved from animal to chimp to human and could have averted that risk?'' he asked. ''To prevent or abort or slow a pandemic saves tens of millions of lives.''
 The second initiative, called ''the missing middle,'' refers to the missing middle class in Africa and South Asia and the missing middle level of financing between microcredits and hedge funds. 
 Microcredit funds currently provide families with three or four or five days of livelihood, Dr. Brilliant said. ''No country,'' he said, ''has ever emerged from poverty because of microcredit. Jobs make that possible. China did it with manufacturing, India did it with outsourced call centers.'' 
 To that end, DotOrg has awarded $3 million to TechnoServe to find worthy entrepreneurs and help them build credit records and get access to larger markets.
 The third initiative, ''information for all,'' is aimed at helping developing countries provide better government services by making information available on their efforts to improve health care, roads and electrification. ''India has promised health care, work, and transparency throughout,'' Dr. Brilliant said. ''Yet it's hard to do something like this on the scale that India is trying to do, to let people know what their entitlement is.'' 
 DotOrg has awarded $2 million to support the Annual Status of Education report in India to assess the quality of education; $765,000 to create a Budget Information Service to improve district-level planning, and $660,000 to build communities of researchers and policy makers to deliver information.
 DotOrg decided to finance literacy information because, said Lant Pritchett, a DotOrg adviser who teaches economic development at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, ''We're looking for things where Google could have a transformative impact. Ideas, flexibility, entrepreneurship are better than just cash on the table.''
 Google.org's fourth initiative supports the development of renewable energy sources that are cleaner and cheaper than coal. DotOrg has invested $10 million in eSolar, a company in Pasadena, Calif., that specializes in solar thermal power. 
 The philanthropy is also working to accelerate the commercialization of plug-in vehicles. Google, whose own computers and customers use plenty of energy, ''does not want to be part of the problem; we want to be part of the solution,'' Dr. Brilliant said.
 ''We're not trying to bring returns to Google,'' Dr. Brilliant said. ''Profits are vital to businesses that will support the missions.'' 
 Mark Dowie, author of the book ''American Foundations,'' said DotOrg is part of ''a new mode of philanthropy that is very similar to venture capitalism, holding those they fund responsible in ways never seen before.'' The danger, he said, ''is that a lot of philanthropic work is not quantifiable. How do you qualify arts grant making, for example.''
 Still, he added, ''what would be worse is for Google not to give away its money, but to hoard it.''

HEADLINE: Mayor Bloomberg's State of the City

 BODY:
National economic indicators may be headed downward, but the annual State of the City speech that New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg delivered Thursday was so upbeat that he proposed another round of tax breaks. The effect was perhaps a little too happy, but the mayor has earned the right to preach at least a little optimism. 
 In what the mayor termed ''a difficult year'' ahead, the city is staring at a possible revenue shortfall of more than $3 billion, which could rise to more than $6 billion in 2011, according to the Independent Budget Office. The numbers would likely have been much higher if not for Mr. Bloomberg's careful stewardship. Instead of spending the billions of dollars in surpluses that came his way in flush times, he paid down future obligations. 
 Mr. Bloomberg's greatest extravagance is his annual $400 property tax rebate for homeowners. It costs $250 million a year, and it does not help the huge number of New Yorkers who do not own their homes. The mayor sensibly stopped short, however, of pledging to keep the much more expensive ($1 billion) 7 percent cut in the property tax rate. That, he said, will be decided by the budget deadline in June.
 The mayor, who has been spending more time recently on national issues, wisely focused his remarks on the formidable task of running the nation's largest city. He took well-earned bows for a city that is cleaner, safer and a bigger draw than ever for tourists. 
 Mr. Bloomberg acknowledged that there is still considerable work to be done, and he continues to put forward innovative solutions. Befitting someone who made his fortune in information technology, he proposed further improving services by steering citizens online. He is still fighting for congestion pricing -- charging drivers fees to use the most clogged streets -- to reduce traffic congestion and pollution. And in the absence of national leadership on poverty issues, he has a pilot program that aims to lift up low-income families by, among other things, paying them to keep their children in school.
 Not all of the ideas Mr. Bloomberg put forward go down easily. He suggested that anyone arrested for a crime in New York be required to submit a DNA sample. New York is a forward-looking city, and its residents have cheered the decline in crime in recent years. But New Yorkers also value their civil liberties, something Mr. Bloomberg -- who has done so much good for the city over the past six years -- sometimes has a tendency to forget.

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Romney in Crucial Victory Over McCain in Michigan'' (front page, Jan. 16): 
 Mitt Romney's victory, coming on the heels of Hillary Rodham Clinton's in New Hampshire, means that the presidential nominations of both parties remain up in the air. And this is as it should be: democracy is ill served if a handful of states with early primaries or caucuses effectively pick the general-election contenders six months or more before the party conventions, essentially freezing most of the country out of the process. 
 Both parties, however, now face a daunting precedent: historically, the party that is first to settle on a nominee is favored in November. Both want to refocus on the general election as early as possible; neither wants to arrive at its convention with the nomination still unsettled. 
 With that in mind, one can expect the race to grow more frantic as the conventions draw nearer. Sadly, one can probably also expect more divisive uproars (among both Democrats and Republicans) such as that over Senator Clinton's alleged insult to the memory of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and several G.O.P. candidates' unsubtle attempts to make Mitt Romney's Mormon faith a campaign issue. 
 The contest has already been less than a shining example of democracy at work. I fear that it will get only worse.

 Re ''Race and Politics'' (editorial, Jan. 17):
 Why do we have to choose between having the first woman president and the first African-American president? The change I most want to see is a re-vision of the office of the presidency, in which two very talented individuals work together to address the many issues that face our nation.
 I don't particularly care who is president and who is vice president. What we need is Hillary Rodham Clinton's experience, particularly in reordering our economic priorities to recapture the stability that was achieved in the 1990s. And Barack Obama's vision and eloquence to meet the challenge of reclaiming our country's true leadership in the world.
 So lay down your arms, Barack and Hillary. Work together now. Show us a new way -- real change -- and the votes will surely follow. Liz Ackert

 Re ''Even at Home, Backers Worry About Giuliani'' (front page, Jan. 17):
 The consensus about Rudolph W. Giuliani's strategy to avoid early primary states and concentrate on Florida is referred to as a ''big gamble'' in your article. I have seen it referred to as ''risky'' elsewhere. This goes to the heart of his judgment as a politician. 
 If he is willing to take such a big risk like this with his own candidacy, then I truly worry about what high-risk plans he has in store for this country. The judgment issue has already been raised by his close association with Bernard B. Kerik, but this arrogant decision to ignore millions of voters in earlier primary states is a direct window on how Mr. Giuliani would govern if elected. The view from this window is not a flattering one.

 Spencertown, N.Y., Jan. 17, 2008
 To the Editor:
 In ''The Identity Trap'' (column, Jan. 15), David Brooks claims that the feminist and civil rights rhetoric ''constructed at a time when the enemy was the reactionary white male establishment'' is no longer necessary. He suggests that the days of that establishment are in the past. 
 But if the Republican debates of this primary campaign have shown us anything, it is that the ''reactionary white male establishment'' is literally all that the Republicans have to offer at this moment in history.
 For Mr. Brooks to say that Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama ''are not facing the white male establishment'' is ludicrous. Of course our system of primaries pits candidates of the same party against each other. But that is only temporary, until a nominee is selected. 
 Once that happens, the Democratic nominee will go back to fighting the same old, same old, white male reactionary Republican platform.

 Re ''Last Year's Role Model'' (Op-Ed, Jan. 13):
 While Lorrie Moore may have a legitimate critique of the Clinton White House, and of boys' experience in schools, her claim that the moment for a woman president has passed because we already have a handful of powerful women in our government is absurd. 
 Women can have jobs and careers and power now, but powerful women, particularly those who don't disguise their desire for power, remain deeply suspect in our culture. 
 Ms. Moore's animosity toward Hillary Rodham Clinton's ''scripted air of expectation'' looks suspiciously like an illustration of that. Irene Papoulis
 West Hartford, Conn., Jan. 14, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Paul Burka writes (''United We Fall,'' Op-Ed, Jan. 12) that there is no politics of unity, as he warns us not to believe in Barack Obama's rhetoric. Mr. Burka says, ''American politics is, and should be, adversarial.'' He calls unity a temporary accommodation. He doesn't get it. 
 We seek some balance between community, cooperation and conflict. We ask elected officials to be professionals who get an important job done. They must understand the complexities and challenges of life and government. Give us laws that are fair and for the common good. And there is a lot of good we agree on. 
 In the heat of conflict, peacemakers remind us of our common bonds. You can often judge a leader's fairness by his enemies, drawn equally from opposing political parties. Some people are visionaries, others fools, who stand far off from the middle ground. Whatever their views, visionary and effective leaders mostly work with the center and nudge it toward progress.

HEADLINE: Fed Chief's Reassurance Fails to Halt Stock Plunge

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The stock market plunged again on Thursday on bad economic news, taking little comfort from reassuring words by the chairman of the Federal Reserve or an emerging consensus about a stimulus plan that many worry could be too late.
 On a day when stocks were pushed down another 3 percent on reports of more weakness in housing and manufacturing -- bringing the decline this year to a stomach-churning 9 percent -- all the major players in Washington agreed on the need for putting extra money into people's hands quickly. 
 President Bush publicly confirmed for the first time that he would propose a package of emergency measures, outlining its basic principles on Friday, in an effort to restore the eroding confidence of investors and consumers. The package is expected to include more than $100 billion in one-time tax rebates for individuals and an opportunity for businesses to rapidly write off their capital investments.
 In a rare sign of his willingness to cut a deal with Democrats in Congress, White House officials said Mr. Bush would not demand that the stimulus package include provisions that permanently extend his signature tax cuts from 2001 and 2003. 
 In a conference call with Democratic leaders on Thursday afternoon, Mr. Bush signaled his eagerness to reach agreement. ''I think there was a collective sense that there was no reason why we can't get something done quickly,'' said Tony Fratto, the White House deputy press secretary. ''I think that was a unanimous feeling on the call.''
 Despite the rising prospect of a fiscal pump-priming effort from Washington, investors on Wall Street remained in a black mood as data showed that the housing debacle was getting worse and beginning to bring down the rest of the economy. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average turned down even as the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, began to deliver his widely anticipated testimony to the House Budget Committee. By the end of the day, the Dow had plunged 307 points; the fall since Jan. 1 is now 9.2 percent. Wall Street started the day with Merrill Lynch reporting that it lost $9.8 billion in the fourth quarter, mainly because of booking $15 billion in losses tied to soured home loans. 
 Adding to the pessimism, which drowned out the reassurances by Mr. Bernanke that a recession could be averted, were reports that manufacturing activity could be slowing even more than analysts had expected, and that housing starts dropped 14 percent last month and reached their lowest level in 16 years.
 Mr. Bernanke insisted that despite concerns about ''slowing growth,'' the economy remained ''extraordinarily resilient.''
 ''It has a strong labor force, excellent productivity and technology and a deep and liquid financial market that is in the process of trying to repair itself,'' Mr. Bernanke said. ''So I think we need to keep in mind also that the economy does have inherent strengths and that those will certainly surface over a period of time.''
 But James W. Paulsen, a strategist at Wells Capital Management, reflected the view of many investors that help from Washington would come too late.
 ''By the time they actually pass anything, it will be past the time we need it,'' Mr. Paulsen said.
 Democratic leaders said they were hopeful about reaching a deal in a few days, but they could end up feuding with Mr. Bush over who should benefit most from the stimulus measures.
 Democrats are drafting a package that would cost about $100 billion and is likely to include one-time tax rebates for workers, expanded unemployment benefits and other measures aimed at middle-income and low-income people who are most likely to spend any extra money immediately.
 Mr. Bush and many Republican lawmakers have argued that any stimulus measure has to include incentives for businesses to spur job creation. But after speaking with the president by telephone, Democratic leaders said they were optimistic about reaching agreement.
 ''The acknowledgment by the president today of the immediate need for a stimulus package is significant progress,'' said the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi of California, after the call. ''In the next few days, through bipartisan negotiations, we are hopeful that we will agree on legislation that provides timely, targeted and temporary assistance.''
 To be sure, there was grumbling. The Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, was irritated that Mr. Bush had abruptly decided to outline a plan on his own instead of developing a bipartisan package with Democrats. ''The President's strategy threatens to unnecessarily politicize the inevitable bipartisan negotiations we will need to quickly enact legislation,'' Mr. Reid complained.
 Mr. Bernanke refused to endorse any specific measures, but he said the key to success would be to act fast and to focus on temporary measures that get extra money into the hands of people within the next 12 months. To do that, he added, Congress would have to pass legislation within the next month or two.
 ''In order for this to be useful, you would need to act quickly,'' Mr. Bernanke told the committee on Thursday morning. ''Stimulus that comes too late will not help support economic activity in the near term, and it could be actively destabilizing.''
 Despite repeated entreaties from Republican lawmakers, Mr. Bernanke refused to endorse calls for making the president's tax cuts permanent rather than letting them expire at the end of 2010. 
 Whatever the merits of that move might be, he told lawmakers, the Bush tax cuts were a matter of long-term fiscal policy that should not be entangled with a short-term stimulus program. 
 Until Thursday, administration officials and many Republican lawmakers had made it clear that making Mr. Bush's tax cuts permanent would be a priority for his last year in office. Those cuts include rate reductions for people at every income level and sharply lower tax rates on investment income.
 Democratic leaders have been adamantly opposed to any such move, and most of the Democratic presidential candidates have called for rolling back the tax cuts at least for families that earn more than about $200,000 a year. But Democrats had worried that Republicans might try to hold a stimulus bill hostage to their demands on the Bush tax cuts.
 Mr. Fratto, the president's deputy press secretary, said Mr. Bush was as determined as ever to make his tax cuts permanent before he leaves office. But he said the issue of a short-term stimulus is a separate matter.
 ''The president supports a permanent extension of his tax cuts, and he supports a short-term growth package, but they are separate,'' Mr. Fratto said.
 For economists and for the Federal Reserve, the big question is which tax cuts or spending measures will produce the biggest and fastest jolt to economic activity.
 Most economists agree that tax rebates are one of the fastest ways to lift consumer spending. They also agree that stimulus measures are most efficient when aimed at low-income or middle-income people, because they are more likely than affluent people to spend any extra money rather than save it.
 According to estimates several years ago by Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody'sEconomy.com, the measures that produced the biggest ''bang for the buck'' were increases in unemployment benefits, which produced about $1.73 in additional demand for every dollar spent. Tax rebates to all citizens generated about $1.19 for every dollar spent, while reductions in tax rates produced only 59 cents per dollar.
 But other economists argue that temporary incentives for business investment have a powerful effect as well. 
 Bloomberg News, citing people who insisted on anonymity, reported that the White House is likely to propose an $800 tax rebate for individuals, a $1,600 rebate for households and investment incentives for businesses.
 Mr. Bernanke told members of the committee on Thursday that even $100 billion would have a significant impact.

 BODY:
Overview of Lesson Plan: In this lesson, students explore the impact of Martin Luther King Jr.'s words 40 years after his death by creating found poems based on his 1968 obituary published in The New York Times.
Author(s):
Jennifer Rittner, The New York Times Learning Network
Yasmin Chin Eisenhauer, Bank Street College of Education in New York
Suggested Time Allowance: one hour
Objectives:
Students will:
1. Share opinions about the teachings and legacy of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
2. Learn about the life of Martin Luther King Jr. by reading and discussing the obituary "Martin Luther King Jr.: Leader of Millions in Nonviolent Drive for Racial Justice."
3. Write found poems using the obituary published in The Times.
4. Write reflection papers that address the impact of Dr. King's teachings on their own lives.
Resources and Materials:
- pens/pencils.
- classroom board.
- computers with Internet access, if available, or handouts of the Learning Network quiz "Who's Who and What's What" found at (one per student).
- highlighter markers (one per student).
- copies of the obituary "Martin Luther King Jr.: Leader of Millions in Nonviolent Drive for Racial Justice," found at www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20080118friday.html (one per student).
Activities and Procedures:
1. WARM-UP/DO-NOW: Before class, prepare a handout of the quiz about the life and impact of Martin Luther King Jr. found on the Learning Network at www.nytimes.com/learning/students/quiz/mlkquiz.html. Alternatively, if the technology is available, prepare workstations to display the quiz and have students complete them online. Otherwise, distribute the quiz as students enter class and give them about five minutes to complete it. Have students share responses and then invite them to discuss their thoughts on the legacy of Dr. King.
Explain that students will read and discuss an obituary of Dr. King from which they will create found poems. A found poem uses words and phrases taken directly from the text of another source, in this case, today's article. Provide students with highlighter markers and prompt them to highlight noteworthy words and phrases as they read. Also note, before they read, the use of the word "negro" throughout the article. You may want to inform your students that the word was conventional at that time and was not intended by the writer to be discriminatory or racist.
2. As a class, read and discuss the article "Martin Luther King Jr.: Leader of Millions in Nonviolent Drive for Racial Justice" (www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20080118friday.html), focusing on the following questions:
a. What was the end goal of the civil rights movement? What statements did Dr. King make concerning those goals?
b. What was Martin Luther King Jr.'s role in that effort? What statements did he make concerning his role in the movement?
c. What was the essential premise of Dr. King's efforts? What statements did he make concerning the purpose of nonviolent resistance?
d. The writer states that, "at the root of [Dr. King's] civil rights convictions was an even more profound faith in the basic goodness of man and the great potential of American democracy." How was this belief reflected in his actions?
e. How was this belief reflected in his reaction to the war in Vietnam? What statements did he make to that effect?
f. Who were his opponents and how did they respond to his efforts at nonviolent resistance? What statements did Dr. King make in response to his opponents?
g. Why did his beliefs and activities stir up conflict among his supporters?
h. In what way was Dr. King between extremes? Explain your answer.
3. Explain to students that they will each work independently to create a found poem that borrows from the rich, descriptive language of the obituary and reimagines Dr. King's life, teachings and legacy.
Prompt them to begin by rereading the article and choosing a theme, like civil rights leader, minister, non-violence, boycott, Dr. King's teachings, Dr. King's legacy, freedom, race or discrimination. Instruct them to then highlight words and phrases that evoke feelings or offer viewpoints related to their respective themes. They should choose proper nouns (people or places), adjectives, adverbs, exclamations, sentence fragments and complete phrases, as appropriate. Remind them that all words they use in their poems must come from the article, including conjunctions, prepositions, articles, etc.
After about 10 minutes, prompt students to arrange, mix up and reorder their words to create their poems. Students may repeat any of their words or phrases to add richness and create greater impact. Challenge them to experiment with line breaks, repetition, alliteration and assonance. How few or how many words do they need to evoke the feelings they intend? Have students create titles for their poems, also using words taken directly from the article.
Toward the end of class, have students read their poems aloud. As they read, ask students to note words or phrases that emerge repeatedly. Write those examples on the board and ask students why those words and phrases seemed particularly evocative.
4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: Based on the article read in class and a more current article about Dr. King, found below, students write reflection papers that address their thoughts on his legacy.
Distribute copies of a more current article found at topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/k/martin_luther_jr_king/index.html, along with the following guiding questions:
- From the 1968 obituary: Selecting one statement quoted in the obituary, to what extent do you agree or disagree with the statement? How do the ideas expressed here affect your own life or the lives of people in your community today? How might your generation have benefited from his teachings? To what degree do you think his teachings might be felt by Americans of a variety of races and ethnicities, if at all?
- From the contemporary article: How might the ideas expressed here support, refute or contradict those expressed in the obituary? What new ideas, conflicts or values have emerged since 1968? Do you believe that Dr. King's legacy is relevant to your life today? Why or why not?
Prompt students to end their reflection papers with two short sentences that respond to the statement they selected. Advise them to use this space to update Dr. King on the legacy of his work, offer a rebuttal to his statement or offer their respective perspectives on how the statement might affect their own beliefs or activities.
Have students submit their finished papers in the next class.
Further Questions for Discussion:
- Do you think it is possible to preserve the memory of historical figures in a way that honors the reality of their lives and work rather than distorts or glorifies their respective images? Why or why not?
- Have you ever felt sad about the loss of a famous or influential person? If so, what were the circumstances?
- In what ways is the civil rights movement both necessary and alive today?
Evaluation and Assessment:
Students will be evaluated based on completion of the quiz and participation in the initial discussion, thoughtfully constructed poems and completion of their reflection papers.
Vocabulary:
Ferocity, emancipation, stature, veritable, alleviate, servility, antagonize, cynical, dogma, gregariousness, opportunism, intangibles, redemptive.
Extension Activities:
1. In honor of Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday, volunteer for a civic cause on behalf of a voiceless or disenfranchised population (human or animal). Write about the experience in your journal.
2. Choose a social activist whom you would like to interview. Research the person's background, career and interests, including reading (or watching) a speech he or she gave on the key issue. What more would you like to know about the person? Why might you wish to interview him or her? On what recent activity or issue might he or she offer some perspective? Prepare a comprehensive list of interview questions based on your research. If possible, send them to the interview subject with a polite request for his or her response. If you receive a response, write a concise, clear article, citing the person's answers. Include any additional research or your own analysis of the issues, or both. Submit your article to the school newspaper for publication.
3. To what does Murray Schumach refer when he speaks of the "full emancipation pledged to [African-Americans] a century before by Abraham Lincoln (paragraph 2 of the obituary)?" Prepare a one-page response to this statement that refers to the Emancipation Proclamation and any other historical precedent that might be relevant.
4. Read the Obituaries section of The New York Times every day for one month and clip one about a figure of interest to you. At the end of the month, construct a found poem that evokes the ideas and images you find most compelling about the person.
5. Prepare a profile of one organization featured in the obituary (like the Congress of Racial Equality, Southern Christian Leadership Conference or National Association for the Advancement of Colored People). What role did this group play at the time of the civil rights movement? What were the initial goals and to what degree were they achieved? What were the major accomplishments of the organization? What role did this group play in the years after the civil rights movement?
6. Prepare a political cartoon that depicts the theme you addressed in your found poem. Display finished work around the classroom.
Interdisciplinary Connections:
Civics - Investigate the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and convene a mock Congress to debate the relevant issues.
Fine Arts - Prepare a playlist of music written or popularized during the civil rights era, like "We Shall Overcome," "Oh Freedom," "This Little Light of Mine," "Strange Fruit" and "Mississippi Goddamn." Play a selection from your playlist over the school intercom each morning during Black History Month. Select a DJ to introduce the songs and provide overviews of the artists and the roles they played in the struggle for civil rights. Invite students to call in requests for songs they think are relevant.
Global History - According to the article, Dr. King was the "third member of his race to win the Nobel Peace Prize." Investigate the lives of the two previous recipients, Ralph Bunche (1950) and Albert John Lutuli (1960). Prepare a mock talk show featuring the three men in which the participants (moderator, Peace Prize recipients and commentators) highlight the winners' backgrounds, goals, accomplishments and obstacles. Create thorough profiles of each winner in preparation for playing those roles. In what ways did these recipients inform one another's work, if at all? How did their accomplishments affect the people in their respective countries or around the world? Why might it have been significant that they earned the Nobel Peace Prize at that point in time? What questions might audience members ask of each man?
Journalism - Create a photographic journal of images that reflects on the legacy of the civil rights movement. What, if any, progress has been made in the communities that participated in marches and boycotts? Find two or three images of the community that show what it looked like during a significant event (like the Montgomery bus boycott, Birmingham sit-ins or the march on Selma). Then find images that show the same general locations today. To what degree have they changed since the earlier period? Write a caption for each image that highlights what it depicts and its relevance to the civil rights movement.
Media Studies - Watch a film about the civil rights movement, like "Eyes on the Prize" (1987), "4 Little Girls" (1997) or "Boycott" (2001). Then interview people in your community who remember the period to learn their impressions of that time. If possible, show them a clip from the film to learn their opinions about the accuracy of its depiction. How do their recollections compare with the images presented in the film? Consider how your interpretation of the film and others' recollections of the times inform your perception. Write five research questions that you might wish to investigate based on what you learned so far.

HEADLINE: When to Start the School Day, So Kids Learn

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''The Early Bird Gets the Bad Grade,'' by Nancy Kalish (Op-Ed, Jan. 14): 
 Finally somebody gets it -- bravo to Ms. Kalish! As the mother of three teenagers, one of whom starts his school day at 7:10, I couldn't agree with her more. 
 Early starts are a complete waste of time; could you do economics before 8 in the morning? And that early start means that high school students get out at 2 p.m., when I see droves of adolescents hitting the streets with their friends with no supervision until 6 or 7 p.m. 
 Has anybody done a study on teenage pregnancy rates, vandalism or spikes in porn Web site access that takes these antediluvian school times into account? 
 Simple parental good sense would predict a correlation. It's time for us adults to wake up. We no longer live in a pre-technological farm-based society, and the school day for our children should match real-time family life in 2008. Lauren Arnold

 To the Editor:
 A schedule change for students would at best temporarily affect learning ability. Once students get used to their new school hours they would adjust their sleeping patterns accordingly. 
 The majority of teenagers will not willingly wake up two or three hours before school begins. 
 In the long run, students will end up with the same amount of sleep and the same problems, only at a different time of day. Fran Flanagan

HEADLINE: Good Jobs Are Where The Money Is

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
I think of the people running this country as the mad-dashers, a largely confused and inconsistent group lurching ineffectively from one enormous problem to another.
 They've made a hash of a war that never should have been launched. They can't find bin Laden. They've been shocked by the subprime debacle. They're lost in a maze on health care.
 Now, like children who have eaten too much sugar, they are frantically trying to figure out how to put a few dollars into the hands of working people to stimulate an enfeebled economy. 
 They should stop, take a deep breath and acknowledge the obvious: the way to put money into the hands of working people is to make sure they have access to good jobs at good wages. That has long been known, but it hasn't been the policy in this country for many years.
 Big business and the federal government have worked hand in hand to squeeze the daylights out of working people, stripping them (in an era of downsizing and globalization) of much of their bargaining power while ferociously pursuing fiscal policies that radically favored the privileged few.
 My colleague at The Times, David Cay Johnston, took a look at income patterns in the U.S. over the past few decades in his new book, ''Free Lunch: How the Wealthiest Americans Enrich Themselves at Government Expense (and Stick You With the Bill).'' 
 From 1980 to 2005 the national economy, adjusted for inflation, more than doubled. (Because of population growth, the actual increase per capita was about 66 percent.) But the average income for the vast majority of Americans actually declined during that period. The standard of living for the average family has improved not because incomes have grown, but because women have gone into the workplace in droves. 
 The peak income year for the bottom 90 percent of Americans was way back in 1973 -- when the average income per taxpayer (adjusted for inflation) was $33,001. That is nearly $4,000 higher than the average in 2005.
 It's incredible but true: 90 percent of the population missed out on the income gains during that long period.
 Mr. Johnston does not mince words: ''The pattern here is clear. The rich are getting fabulously richer, the vast majority are somewhat worse off, and the bottom half -- for all practical purposes, the poor -- are being savaged by our current economic policies.''
 His words are echoed in a proposed stimulus plan currently offered by the Economic Policy Institute in Washington. (The plan is available on its Web site, epi.org.) Stressing that any stimulus package should be ''fair,'' the authors of the institute's proposal wrote:
 ''The distribution of wages, income and wealth in the United States has become vastly more unequal over the last 30 years. In fact, this country has a more unequal distribution of income than any other advanced country.''
 Economic alarm bells have been ringing in the U.S. for some time. There was no sense of urgency as long as those in the lower ranks were sinking in the mortgage muck and the middle class was raiding the piggy bank otherwise known as home equity.
 But now that the privileged few are threatened (Merrill Lynch took a $9.8 billion fourth-quarter hit, and the stock market has spent the first part of the year behaving like an Olympic diving champion), it's suddenly time to take action.
 There is no question that some kind of stimulus package geared to the needs of ordinary Americans is in order. But that won't begin to solve the fundamental problem.
 Good jobs at good wages -- lots of them, growing like spring flowers in an endlessly fertile field -- is the absolutely essential basis for a thriving American economy and a broad-based rise in standards of living.
 Forget all the CNBC chatter about Fed policy and bargain stocks. For ordinary Americans, jobs are the be-all and end-all. And an America awash in new jobs will require a political environment that respects and rewards work and aggressively pursues creative policies designed to radically expand employment.
 I'd start with a broad program to rebuild the American infrastructure. This would have the dual benefit of putting large numbers of people to work and answering a crying need. The infrastructure is in sorry shape. New Orleans comes to mind, and the tragic bridge collapse in Minneapolis.
 The country that gave us the Marshall Plan to rebuild postwar Europe ought to be able, 60 years later, to reconstitute its own sagging infrastructure.
 There are also untold numbers of jobs and myriad societal benefits to be reaped from a sustained, good-faith effort to achieve energy self-sufficiency. Think Manhattan Project.
 The possibilities are limitless. We could create an entire generation of new jobs and build a bigger and fairer economy for the 21st century. If only we were serious.

HEADLINE: Internet Puts A Sugarcoat On Scalping

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA

 BODY:
Big games tomorrow. Green Bay against the Giants at Lambeau Field. New England versus San Diego in Foxborough. Winners go to the Super Bowl. Big, big games.
 Do you want to go to one of them? Seriously. Even though the first kickoff is less than 36 hours away, I'll bet you could. Late Thursday evening, I checked StubHub, the leading vendor of tickets in what's now called the secondary market. ''No Risk Playoff Tickets'' screamed the site's headline.
 I clicked through to the N.F.C. championship game. Sure enough, there were plenty of tickets. StubHub had lower-level end zone seats for prices from $560 to $642 each. If you were willing to pay $1,000 a ticket, you could have seen the game from a section along either sideline. And if you wanted to step it up a few notches, you could have even gotten club seats for around $2,000 a ticket. As for the New England-San Diego game, prices ranged from $200 (standing room) to $1,300 (club seats). If you buy them today, StubHub will have temporary locations set up that will allow you to pick up your tickets on the way to the game. 
 At TicketsNow.com, a Web site that competes with StubHub -- and agreed to be bought by Ticketmaster just this week, for an estimated $265 million -- it was the same story: it had 1,096 tickets ranging from $268 to $2,007 for the N.F.C. championship game. RazorGator had tickets. Ezticket-search.com had tickets. Everybody, it seemed, was selling tickets. Expensive tickets, to be sure -- tickets that were selling for hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars more than their face value. But tickets nonetheless. Tickets that will absolutely get you into the game. That's what StubHub means by ''no risk playoff tickets.'' Indeed, virtually all the online sellers of tickets in the secondary market offer some kind of guarantee. 
 And where do these tickets come from? Oftentimes, they come from season ticket holders who can't go to the game, or want to make a quick killing. Or they come from canny ticket brokers who have maneuvered, by hook or by crook, to get their hands on tickets they can then resell for a big profit.
 But wait -- isn't this what we used to call, you know, scalping? And isn't it supposed to be disreputable, unseemly and maybe even illegal? As recently as 2002, Greg Aiello, the longtime public relations guy for the National Football League, said of the growing Internet resale market: ''We view it as unethical and in some cases against the law. It suggests a desire to profit personally and perhaps illegally on the coattails of either the N.F.L. or the team.'' 
 So the answer to the first question is yes: what StubHub and its competitors do is create a marketplace where people can scalp tickets. ''We don't like to use that term,'' said Chris Tsakalakis, a former eBay executive who now runs StubHub, wincing slightly when I used the word ''scalp.'' (EBay bought StubHub, for more than $300 million, in early 2007.) But that's what it is.
 As to the second question, well, let's just say things have changed. ''Our research shows that fans are accepting it as a positive,'' said Neil Glat, the N.F.L. senior vice president for strategic planning and business development. And so is the league, which recently cut a deal to allow Ticketmaster to become the league's ''official ticket reseller.'' Reportedly, Ticketmaster is paying the N.F.L. around $20 million a year for the privilege. No wonder it ran out and bought TicketsNow.
 Or, as Mr. Glat put it at another point in our conversation, ''It's a little bit of 'if you can't beat 'em, join 'em.'<0>''
 Thus does the Internet wreak havoc on yet another business model. Except in this case, it has taught major league sports teams, most of whom now have their own deals with online ticket scalpers -- oops, I mean secondary market brokers -- something that should have been obvious all along: scalping was never really the problem. The problem has been the ridiculous amount of effort expended trying to stamp it out.
 If you go to the Web site of Andrew M. Cuomo, the New York attorney general, you'll find a gloriously outdated, and wonderfully illuminating, 1999 document that nobody seems to have bothered erasing. Entitled, ''Why Can't I Get Tickets?'' it amounts to a 34-page screed directed against ticket scalping. It also offers a justification for the state's periodic efforts to crack down on, among others, Manhattan hotel concierges who bought scalped tickets for hotel guests.
 Scarce tickets, wrote the anonymous author, ''can be laid at the door of illicit practices in the ticket industry and other practices that, although possibly not illegal, are deceptive, unfair to the ticket-buying public and supportive of the corrupt ticket distribution system.'' 
 Of course, the real reason you can't get tickets has nothing to do with ''the corrupt ticket distribution system,'' and never really has. And it hasn't had much to do with unfairness either --though I admit that the world would be a better place if we could all get tickets at face value.
 The real reason we can't is basic economics. Hot tickets for big events are always in scarce supply -- and long before the Internet came along, there was a thriving ticket broker industry that wangled scarce tickets and sold them at their true market price. At events like the N.F.L. playoffs, so many corporate sponsors and other pooh-bahs have first call on tickets, that there really aren't that many left over for the general public. 
 Still, nobody really wants to accept how inaccessible a big sporting event is. Teams price tickets well below their true economic value in order to create the belief that any fan can afford to go to the game. And for years, they pushed for anti-scalping laws to prevent those who did have tickets from arbitraging the difference between the face value of the ticket and its true value. To this day, the New England Patriots will take away season tickets from any season ticket holder it catches selling into the secondary market. 
 But why? Once upon a time, you could argue that people who bought scalped tickets might wind up buying counterfeit tickets -- or that scalpers standing outside an arena created a public nuisance. But you can't make those arguments anymore: the rise of the online scalpers like StubHub has eliminated those worries. They've also done two other things: they've made it plain that anti-scalping laws are unenforceable. And they've exposed the absurdity of trying to stamp out something that is so powerfully driven by the laws of supply and demand. 
 Indeed if you look through the academic research on scalping -- and there is a surprising amount of it -- what you'll find is a universal belief that efforts to stamp out scalping were always ridiculous. ''The cause of ticket scalping is that tickets are underpriced,'' said Stephen K. Happel, an economics professor at Arizona State University. ''The best way to deal with this is let the free market flourish.''
 Like other economists, he views the ''face value'' of a ticket as the starting point of a negotiation rather than a number that reflects the true value of a ticket. And he made the sensible point that teams should want their season ticket holders to be able to offload tickets into the secondary market. After all, if they know they can get rid of tickets they can't use, they'll be much happier to keep buying season tickets.
 When I spoke to Jeff Fluhr, a co-founder of StubHub (he left after the company was bought by eBay), he told me that at first, teams treated the company as if it was the devil. ''There's a stigma,'' he said. But then a funny thing happened: as more and more fans turned to the secondary market to offload tickets -- and, yes, as more professional scalpers used the secondary market to make a profit -- the teams started coming around. 
 Mark Cuban, the owner of the Dallas Mavericks, told me in an e-mail message that the secondary market was so useful that teams should probably run their own market, rather than letting sites like StubHub do it for them. He added that the Mavs are considering selling some tickets on the secondary market ''as a means of confirming the 'actual value' of the game; it allows us to be smarter in our ticket pricing.''
 Meanwhile, as the futility of trying to stamp out scalping became increasingly obvious, state and local legislatures began rethinking their previous opposition. StubHub and its competitors started lobbying legislatures all over the country to overturn anti-scalping laws -- and by and large they succeeded. (Massachusetts is one of the few holdouts.) In New York, the state's longstanding opposition to scalping was eliminated last summer. The bill was held up for a while because the New York Yankees wanted to control the resale of their tickets -- but in the end, the Yankees lost. ''I think permitting a free market to work its magic there is a smart approach,'' said Gov. Eliot Spitzer at the time.
 And it is. Or rather, there really isn't much other choice -- even if it does mean that the richer you are, the more likely you'll be able to go to a big-time sporting event. But hasn't that always been the case? When you think about it, perhaps one of the reasons the N.F.L. tried to stamp out scalping was to create the illusion that that wasn't the case. But it was always just that: an illusion.
 The real worry, it seems to me, is that now that so many teams -- and all four major leagues --have begun to get a piece of the action from the secondary market, they'll take the next obvious step: they'll start pricing their tickets more realistically. Other industries, like the airlines and hotels, use variable pricing all the time -- raising prices during times of high demand, and lowering them when there is less demand. It is hard to believe that sports teams won't eventually do likewise. If tickets for tomorrow's game are worth $1,000 rather $100, what's to stop the N.F.L. from selling the ticket for that much in the first place? 
 Economic rationality stinks, doesn't it?

HEADLINE: Job Data Passes Threshold Where Recessions Dwell

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
E-mail: norris@nytimes.com

 BODY:
When the number of Americans out of work starts to rise sharply, a recession occurs.
 By that token, the latest figure for unemployed workers is, at the least, a danger sign.
 The Labor Department reported that in December some 7,655,000 people were unemployed, meaning they were both without a job and looking for one. That figure was 13.2 percent higher than the 6,760,000 figure in the previous December. In the past, a 13 percent annual rise has been the sign of a recession every time.
 Before December, there have been nine cycles in the United States since 1950 in which the annual change in unemployment rose to 13 percent or higher. 
 In eight of those cases, by the time the rise got to 13 percent, the recession had already begun, according to later conclusions by the National Bureau of Economic Research. In the other one, the recession began three months later, as depicted in the accompanying charts, which show the year-over-year change in the number of unemployed workers from one year before the increase hit 13 percent until one year after the recession ended. (In the case of the early 1980s, when there were two recessions close together, the chart shows both of them.)
 The bureau does not, by the way, define a recession as two quarters of decline in the real gross domestic product, although that is a widely used shorthand. Instead, it says ''a recession is a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy, lasting more than a few months, normally visible in real G.D.P., real income, employment, industrial production, and wholesale-retail sales.''
 The fact that employment is one of the indicators helps to explain the close correlation historically, but it would not be there if there had been surges in unemployment that did not correspond with broader economic slowdowns.
 The idea that a recession is now here, when the unemployment rate is only 5 percent, may seem odd to anyone who lived through recent decades. That figure is less than half the high reached in 1982, and below the average rate of the 1970s, 1980s or 1990s. But sometimes it is the trend that counts, more than the absolute level.
 In earlier decades, there was nothing unusual in a recession starting with an unemployment rate of 5 percent or less. Of the nine recessions since 1950 listed by the economic research bureau, five began with unemployment lower than that. They were the downturns in 1953, 1957, 1969, 1973 and 2001.
 The normal pattern is for the 13 percent annual increase in the number of unemployed to come a few months after the recession began, although usually well before it was clear to economists that the downturn had arrived, and then to go much higher. The annual gains in joblessness usually stay above 13 percent until several months after the recession is over.
 The only time the unemployment rise came before the recession actually started was in 1969, when the increase hit the 13 percent mark in September but the recession's official starting date was later determined to be in December. That was also a rare instance where the annual change, after rising to 13 percent, slipped below that level for a couple of months. It did not move above 13 percent to stay until January 1970, a month after the recession began.
 Employment is traditionally seen as a lagging economic indicator, because companies can be reluctant to lay off workers when demand first starts to slip, waiting until the bad news is clear. When the recession ends, there is a similar reluctance to hire until it is clear that a pickup in business is not temporary.
 There is, of course, no guarantee that a recession is coming. In 1956 and again in 1967 there were 12 percent increases in the number of unemployed people, but the rate of gain fell back quickly and no recession quickly ensued. But the figure has never risen to 13 percent without a downturn being imminent or already under way.

GRAPHIC: CHART: One More Indicator: Rising Unemployment: The number of unemployed Americans rose 13 percent in December 2007 from December 2006. In the past, such increases have always been associated with recessions. The charts show the 12-month change in unemployment from a year before the 13 percent line was crossed until a year after the recession ended.(Sources: Bureau of Labor Statistics via Haver Analytics, National Bureau of Economic Research) Chart details various bar graphs for the following: Year over year change

 BODY:
TIGHTER CREDIT IN EUROPE The European Central Bank said that lenders had sharply tightened credit standards in response to turmoil in financial markets, meaning that less money was likely to be available to companies for investment and to consumers for purchases. The finding, from the bank's latest quarterly survey of lending conditions was the clearest sign yet that convulsing credit markets would take a bite out of growth in the euro zone, possibly leading the central bank to cut interest rates later in the year. 
 The survey showed that 41 percent of the banks in the 15-country euro zone were imposing tougher conditions on corporate borrowers. ''The sharp tightening reflects the deterioration of financial market conditions since the start of the financial turmoil last summer and a worsening of banks' situation,'' the central bank wrote in the survey. Losses linked to subprime mortgages and volatility in financial markets have forced many banks in the United States to seek recapitalization from foreign investors. European banks, though faced with write-downs, have not been hit as hard as their American rivals. CARTER DOUGHERTY 
 CAUTION AT SCHLUMBERGER The oil field services provider Schlumberger reported a 22 percent rise in fourth-quarter profit but failed to meet Wall Street expectations. Fourth-quarter results were driven by demand in the Eastern Hemisphere and Latin America, but North American profits disappointed. The chairman and chief executive, Andrew F.J. Gould, gave a cautious near-term outlook, and analysts said the news did not bode well for others in the services sector. Schlumberger reported a net profit of $1.38 billion, or $1.12 a share, compared to a year-earlier profit of $1.13 billion, or 92 cents a share. Share fell $2.99, to $79.52. (AP) SINKING CONSUMER OUTLOOK Consumer confidence in Japan worsened in December, falling to its lowest level in four and a half years, the government said. The index for the Cabinet Office's consumer confidence survey, which measures consumers' economic outlook for six months, fell 1.8 points from the previous month to 38 in December. It was the third month of decline. (AP) BREEDEN JOINS ZALE BOARD The Zale Corporation, the jewelry chain, appointed Richard C. Breeden, the former Securities and Exchange Commission chairman, to its board after he acquired a stake of more than 18 percent. Mr. Breeden, left, who runs the hedge fund Breeden Capital Management, and his colleague James M. Cotter will occupy two of Zale's eight board seats, the company said. Zale posted losses in four of the last six quarters, sending the shares down 43 percent last year. 
 (BLOOMBERG NEWS)
 WARNING FROM MEXICO'S BANK Mexico's central bank held its key overnight interest rate steady at 7.50 percent, but warned that a recession in the United States could hurt Mexico's economy. The central bank said in its monthly policy review that inflation is within its forecast range, which calls for the pace of price rises to drop toward 3 percent by 2009. More expensive food has not led to inflation in prices of other goods so far, it said, but added: ''The increases in food prices ... will continue to be a central cause for concern.'' (REUTERS) O'NEAL NOW ON ALCOA BOARD Alcoa, the world's third-largest aluminum company, appointed the former chief executive of Merrill Lynch, E. Stanley O'Neal, to its board. Mr. O'Neal, 56, was forced to resign Oct. 30 after Merrill disclosed $8.4 billion of write-downs on mortgage-related investments and bad loans. The company said Thursday that it had $16.7 billion of write-downs, causing a fourth-quarter loss of $9.83 billion. 
 (BLOOMBERG NEWS) DIVIDEND CUTFannie Mae, the housing finance giant, said it would go ahead with a planned 30-percent dividend cut in the current quarter, lowering the payment to 35 cents a share from 50 cents a share. The company said last month that its board planned to approve the dividend cut in January. 
 (AP/DOW JONES)
 LAYOFFS AT SALLIE MAESallie Mae, the nation's largest student lender, said it would lay off 350 workers, or about 3 percent of its work force nationwide, to help cut costs 20 percent by 2010. The company, formally known as the SLM Corporation, lost $344 million in its latest reported quarterly results and said additional layoffs are likely. (AP)

HEADLINE: Work Is Afoot to Take the Free Out of Freeway

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON; Nate Schweber contributed reporting from East Stroudsburg, Pa.

DATELINE: DELAWARE WATER GAP, Pa. 

 BODY:
Hundreds of cars and trucks scream past Chris Howsare and Laren Myers in the half-hour they spend examining the hodgepodge of wetlands, historic landmarks and utility lines on the stretch of Interstate 80 that bisects this town on the New Jersey border.
 Except for a small culvert unearthed by these two environmental planners, everything matches their maps.
 So goes the laborious surveying needed to find 10 sites for tollbooths that the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission wants to install by 2010 along the 311-mile stretch of I-80 that spans the state.
 ''It's a process of elimination,'' said Ms. Howsare, who works with Mr. Myers at McCormick Taylor, a Philadelphia engineering firm hired by the commission to come up with a list of possible sites. ''We'll tell them that if they want to build here, they'll need to get x, y and z permits.'' 
 The new tolls, a particularly controversial part of Pennsylvania's plans to meet its growing transportation needs, are an unpopular idea among users of I-80, long a free alternative to the Pennsylvania Turnpike for truckers, tourists and residents alike. But with Pennsylvania's budgets stretched, like those of many other states, the legislature approved the proposal last July.
 The tolls -- which still face hurdles, notably a need for approval from the federal government -- would provide a substantial share of the hundreds of millions of dollars a year that the state says it needs to repair and expand its roads and bridges and so keep up with traffic growth.
 ''The wish list is extensive,'' said Chuck Ardo, a spokesman for Gov. Edward G. Rendell. ''We have the highest number of structurally deficient bridges in the country, miles and miles of highway that need repair and public transit systems that need support.''
 The transportation squeeze is hardly unique to Pennsylvania.
 ''There is a perfect storm,'' said Phineas Baxandall, an analyst at the United States Public Interest Research Group. ''States have had a hard time facing up to their shortfalls in their transportation programs, gas taxes haven't kept up with inflation, and there's all these bridges and roads that haven't been maintained.''
 The push to charge tolls along I-80 followed legislators' rejection of Mr. Rendell's proposal to lease the Pennsylvania Turnpike to private investors, an approach taken in Illinois, Indiana and Virginia. Lawmakers were wary that the investors might raise tolls too quickly.
 The governor continues to support that idea, though, because the proceeds could be used for more than highway repairs alone. Under the bill passed last July, as well as federal rules, revenue from tolls on I-80 can be spent only on that Interstate.
 As in other states, Pennsylvania lawmakers have been reluctant to raise their gasoline tax, the fourth-highest in the country, because fuel prices are so high. The tax would need to rise by 13 cents a gallon to meet the state's transportation needs, the turnpike commission estimates. (In neighboring New Jersey, where the gas tax is the third-lowest in the country, Gov. Jon S. Corzine introduced a proposal last week to raise tolls on the New Jersey Turnpike, the Garden State Parkway and the Atlantic City Expressway as much as 700 percent by 2022.)
 Under Pennsylvania's plan, drivers on I-80 would pay the same as on the turnpike. Cars crossing the entire state would be charged $25, trucks $93.
 ''We're working to solve the state's transportation-funding crisis to ensure we have a vibrant, growing economy across the I-80 corridor and the entire commonwealth,'' said the commission's chief executive, Joseph G. Brimmeier.
 But Mike Biondi, owner of a trucking company that hauls produce, said that he considered the new tolls, combined with fuel taxes, akin to ''double taxation'' and that the higher costs would be passed on to consumers. ''These trucking companies cannot absorb that,'' he said.
 ''It couldn't come at a worse time,'' Mr. Biondi, of Moscow, Pa., near Scranton, said at a commission hearing in East Stroudsburg. ''We're getting whacked.''
 Yet the growing burden on I-80 and other roads in Pennsylvania has outpaced the financing for them. According to the commission, the state needs $1.04 billion a year for paving and repair of its Interstate roads and bridges. Currently, only $380 million a year is available.
 The state wants to spend $2.1 billion in toll revenue over 10 years to improve I-80. Contrary to the claims of some critics, none of that money could be used to pay for mass transit in Philadelphia and other cities.
 States need federal approval to collect tolls on Interstate highways, and the Bush administration has been making it easier for private investors and states to play a greater role in managing those roads. ''The nature of highway funding is changing,'' said Ian M. Grossman, a spokesman for the Federal Highway Administration. ''We are encouraging innovative approaches.''
 In October, the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission and the state's Department of Transportation applied to the federal agency for the last of three slots in a program that allows states to charge tolls on federally financed highways as long as the money is used to make repairs that could not be made otherwise. (Missouri and Virginia have received the two other slots for their portions of I-70 and I-81, respectively.) 
 In December, the highway agency requested more information of Pennsylvania, which is preparing a response that includes the data being compiled by Ms. Howsare and Mr. Myers, the environmental planners. The turnpike commission must work quickly, though, because it has already issued bonds in anticipation of starting to collect toll revenue by 2010 to pay them off.
 ''When you are talking about 300 miles, trying to get it done in three years is mind-boggling,'' Ms. Howsare said of the survey work.
 Thorny negotiations over where to put the 10 tollbooths are certain once a short list of potential sites is released in a few months. I-80 has 59 interchanges in Pennsylvania, so tollbooths would be placed every six exits or so. To assuage many drivers, the commission is considering keeping the tollgates away from towns where lots of commuters use I-80, so that people in places like Clarion, State College and Wilkes-Barre can avoid paying tolls for local trips.
 But residents worry that I-80 tolls would nonetheless be so expensive that drivers would opt for nearby roads instead, creating heavy traffic there.
 Of Route 611, which runs near I-80, Peggy Craft of Stroudsburg said: ''You get a half a dozen trucks on there and it takes forever to get through town. It's going to impair us local folks who use that road for errands.''

HEADLINE: A New, Global Oil Quandary: Costly Fuel Means Costly Calories

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER; Contributing reporting were Andrew Martin in New York, Anand Giridharadas in Kale, India, and Michael Rubenstein in Mumbai.

DATELINE: KUANTAN, Malaysia 

 BODY:
Rising prices for cooking oil are forcing residents of Asia's largest slum, in Mumbai, India, to ration every drop. Bakeries in the United States are fretting over higher shortening costs. And here in Malaysia, brand-new factories built to convert vegetable oil into diesel sit idle, their owners unable to afford the raw material. 
 This is the other oil shock. From India to Indiana, shortages and soaring prices for palm oil, soybean oil and many other types of vegetable oils are the latest, most striking example of a developing global problem: costly food.
 The food price index of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, based on export prices for 60 internationally traded foodstuffs, climbed 37 percent last year. That was on top of a 14 percent increase in 2006, and the trend has accelerated this winter. 
 In some poor countries, desperation is taking hold. Just in the last week, protests have erupted in Pakistan over wheat shortages, and in Indonesia over soybean shortages. Egypt has banned rice exports to keep food at home, and China has put price controls on cooking oil, grain, meat, milk and eggs.
 According to the F.A.O., food riots have erupted in recent months in Guinea, Mauritania, Mexico, Morocco, Senegal, Uzbekistan and Yemen.
 ''The urban poor, the rural landless and small and marginal farmers stand to lose,'' said He Changchui, the agency's chief representative for Asia and the Pacific.
 A startling change is unfolding in the world's food markets. Soaring fuel prices have altered the equation for growing food and transporting it across the globe. Huge demand for biofuels has created tension between using land to produce fuel and using it for food.
 A growing middle class in the developing world is demanding more protein, from pork and hamburgers to chicken and ice cream. And all this is happening even as global climate change may be starting to make it harder to grow food in some of the places best equipped to do so, like Australia.
 In the last few years, world demand for crops and meat has been rising sharply. It remains an open question how and when the supply will catch up. For the foreseeable future, that probably means higher prices at the grocery store and fatter paychecks for farmers of major crops like corn, wheat and soybeans. 
 There may be worse inflation to come. Food experts say steep increases in commodity prices have not fully made their way to street stalls in the developing world or supermarkets in the West.
 Governments in many poor countries have tried to respond by stepping up food subsidies, imposing or tightening price controls, restricting exports and cutting food import duties.
 These temporary measures are already breaking down. Across Southeast Asia, for example, families have been hoarding palm oil. Smugglers have been bidding up prices as they move the oil from more subsidized markets, like Malaysia's, to less subsidized markets, like Singapore's.
 No category of food prices has risen as quickly this winter as so-called edible oils -- with sometimes tragic results. When a Carrefour store in Chongqing, China, announced a limited-time cooking oil promotion in November, a stampede of would-be buyers left 3 people dead and 31 injured. 
 Cooking oil may seem a trifling expense in the West. But in the developing world, cooking oil is an important source of calories and represents one of the biggest cash outlays for poor families, which grow much of their own food but have to buy oil in which to cook it. 
 Few crops illustrate the emerging problems in the global food chain as well as palm oil, a vital commodity in much of the world and particularly Asia. From jungles and street markets in Southeast Asia to food companies in the United States and biodiesel factories in Europe, soaring prices for the oil are drawing environmentalists, energy companies, consumers, indigenous peoples and governments into acrimonious disputes.
 The oil palm is a stout-trunked tree with a spray of frilly fronds at the top that make it look like an enormous sea anemone. The trees, with their distinctive, star-like patterns of leaves, cover an eighth of the entire land area of Malaysia and even greater acreage in nearby Indonesia.
 An Efficient Producer
 The palm is a highly efficient producer of vegetable oil, squeezed from the tree's thick bunches of plum-size bright red fruit. An acre of oil palms yields as much oil as eight acres of soybeans, the main rival for oil palms; rapeseed, used to make canola oil, is a distant third. Among major crops, only sugar cane comes close to rivaling oil palms in calories of human food per acre.
 Palm oil prices have jumped nearly 70 percent in the last year because supply has grown slowly while demand has soared. 
 Farmers and plantation companies are responding to the higher prices, clearing hundreds of thousands of acres of tropical forest to replant with rows of oil palms. But an oil palm takes eight years to reach full production. A drought last year in Indonesia and flooding in Peninsular Malaysia helped constrain supply. Worldwide palm oil output climbed just 2.7 percent last year, to 42.1 million tons.
 At the same time, palm oil demand is growing steeply for a variety of reasons around the globe. They include shifting decisions among farmers about what to plant, rising consumer demand in China and India for edible oils, and Western subsidies for biofuel production.
 American farmers have been planting more corn and less soy because demand for corn-based ethanol has pushed up corn prices. American soybean acreage plunged 19 percent last year, producing a drop in soybean oil output and inventories.
 Chinese farmers also cut back soybean acreage last year, as urban sprawl covered prime farmland and the Chinese government provided more incentives for grain.
 Yet people in China are also consuming more oils. China not only was the world's biggest palm oil importer last year, holding steady at 5.2 million tons in the first 11 months of the year, but it also doubled its soybean oil imports to 2.9 million tons, forcing buyers elsewhere to switch to palm oil.
 Concerns about nutrition used to hurt palm oil sales, but they are now starting to help. The oil was long regarded in the West as unhealthy, but it has become an attractive option to replace the chemically altered fats known as trans fats, which have lately come to be seen as the least healthy of all fats.
 New York City banned trans fats in frying at food service establishments last summer and will ban them in bakery goods this summer. Across the country, manufacturers are trying to replace trans fats. American palm oil imports nearly doubled in the first 11 months of last year, rising by 200,000 tons.
 ''Four years ago, when this whole no-trans issue started, we processed no palm here,'' said Mark Weyland, a United States product manager for Loders Croklaan, a Dutch company that supplies palm oil. ''Now it's our biggest seller.''
 Last year, conversion of palm oil into fuel was a fast-growing source of demand, but in recent weeks, rising prices have thrown that business into turmoil.
 Here on Malaysia's eastern shore, a series of 45-foot-high green and gray storage tanks connect to a labyrinth of yellow and silver pipes. The gleaming new refinery has the capacity to turn 116,000 tons a year of palm oil into 110,000 tons of a fuel called biodiesel, as well as valuable byproducts like glycerin. Mission Biofuels, an Australian company, finished the refinery last month and isworking on an even larger factory next door at the base of a jungle hillside.
 But prices have spiked so much that the company cannot cover all its costs and has idled the finished refinery while looking for a new strategy, such as asking a biodiesel buyer to pay a price linked to palm oil costs, and someday switching from palm oil to jatropha, a roadside weed.
 ''We took a view that palm oil prices were already high; we didn't think they could go even higher, and then they did,'' said Nathan Mahalingam, the company's managing director.
 Growth in Biofuels
 Biofuels accounted for almost half the increase in worldwide demand for vegetable oils last year, and represented 7 percent of total consumption of the oils, according to Oil World, a forecasting service in Hamburg, Germany.
 The growth of biodiesel, which can be mixed with regular diesel, has been controversial, not only because it competes with food uses of oil but also because of environmental concerns. European conservation groups have been warning that tropical forests are being leveled to make way for oil palm plantations, destroying habitat for orangutans and Sumatran rhinoceroses while also releasing greenhouse gases.
 The European Union has moved to restrict imports of palm oil grown in unsustainable ways. The measure has incensed the Malaysian palm oil industry, which had plunged into biofuel production in part to satisfy European demand.
 Another controversy involves the treatment of indigenous peoples whose lands have been seized by oil plantations. This has been a particular issue on Borneo.
 Anne B. Lasimbang, executive director of the Pacos Trust in the Malaysian state of Sabah in northern Borneo, said that while some indigenous people had benefited from selling palm oil that they grow themselves, many had lost ancestral lands with little to show for it, including lands that used to provide habitats for endangered orangutans.
 ''Finally, some of the pressures internationally have trickled down. Some of the companies are more open to dialogue; they want to talk to communities,'' said Ms. Lasimbang, a member of the Dusun indigenous group. ''On our side, we are still suspicious.''
 Demand Outstrips Supply
 As the multiple conflicts and economic pressures associated with palm oil play out in the global economy, the bottom line seems to be that the world wants more of the oil than it can get.
 Even in Malaysia, the center of the global palm oil industry for half a century, spot shortages have cropped up. Recently, as wholesale prices soared, cooking oil refiners complained of inadequate subsidies and cut back production of household oil, sold at low, regulated prices.
 Street vendors in the capital, Kuala Lumpur, complain that they cannot find enough cooking oil to prepare roti canai, the flatbread that is the national snack. ''It's very difficult; it's hard to find,'' said one vendor who gave only his first name, Palani, after admitting that he was secretly buying cooking oil intended for households instead of paying the much higher price for commercial use.
 Many of the hardest-hit victims of rising food prices are in the vast slums that surround cities in poorer Asian nations. The Kawle family in Mumbai's sprawling Dharavi slum, a household of nine with just one member working as a laborer for $60 a month, is coping with recent price increases for palm oil.
 The family has responded by eating fish once a week instead of twice, seldom cooking vegetables and cutting its monthly rice consumption. Next to go will be the weekly smidgen of lamb.
 ''If the prices go up again,'' said Janaron Kawle, the family patriarch, ''we'll cut the mutton to twice a month and use less oil.''

HEADLINE: An Unexpected Uptick in Confidence

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The mood of consumers brightened a bit in January, even amid the constant drumbeat of talk about a possible recession, weak jobs market and falling stock prices. 
 At the same time, another report released on Friday showed that leading economic indicators for December continued to weaken, suggesting growth would remain sluggish for some time.
 The reports came at a time when the Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates and the White House is considering a fiscal stimulus package. 
 The Reuters/University of Michigan consumer confidence reading for January was 80.5, well above the Wall Street consensus of 74.5. The reading rose from 75.5 in December.
 The Conference Board's leading economic indicators report for December fell 0.2 percent, its third consecutive decline.

HEADLINE: Gold's Rise: It's Not Just Armageddon

BYLINE: By CONRAD DE AENLLE

 BODY:
THE price of gold has always been a way to keep score of economic, financial and political instability, but the game may be changing. The dollar is weak, inflation is troublesome and the world isn't getting any safer, but it is hard to see how those factors alone drove gold from just over $250 an ounce in 2001 to more than $900.
 The decline in the dollar over the same time works out to less than 5 percent a year. The reported level of inflation is a fairly ordinary 3 percent or so, and government calculations do not take account of falling home prices and technological innovations that give consumers more bytes for the buck. As for politics, terrorism remains a threat, but it seems no greater or smaller than it has been most of the decade. 
 What has changed, many say, is that gold no longer benefits just from threats to prosperity but from prosperity itself.
 ''Gold is the ultimate commodity, and it carries the added cachet as a safe haven,'' said Robert D. Arnott, chairman of Research Affiliates, an asset-management firm. ''Demand for gold plays a role in a strong economy, in a turbulent economy and also when there's inflation.''
 The supply-demand balance could send gold to $1,000 an ounce before long, said Vahid Fathi, an analyst for Morningstar. New supplies of ore are hard to find, he noted, and central banks have scaled back bullion sales. As for demand, it is strong from ''the new class of prosperous consumers out there in China and India that traditionally have an affection for gold,'' he said.
 Gold has helped make a lot of investors prosperous lately, but betting on continued strong gains almost requires economic conditions to be ordered a la carte.
 Global growth must remain strong, even as it becomes palpably weaker in the United States and Europe, where most of the world's money is.And because much of the rise in gold must still come from its role as an inflation hedge, the slowdown in the West must somehow be accompanied by rising consumer prices.
 Look at it this way: If gold is such a ''heads I win tails you lose'' proposition, then why did it perform so poorly for so long? Gold bulls have hailed the run to record highs as a breakout, heralding further advances -- but it took 28 years to arrive. Neither Mr. Fathi nor Mr. Arnott could be considered gold bugs, that peculiar species of financial fauna with an unstinting belief gold prices rise perpetually.
 Mr. Fathi's $1,000 target is not much more than 10 percent above recent levels, and his regard for mining shares is lukewarm at best. The dearth of fresh gold supplies raises prices, but it limits profit growth, he said, as do rising costs of commodities like aluminum used in processing ore.
 Those conditions drive him to look for companies that are holding the line on costs while developing reserves. Mr. Fathi is modestly bullish on Harmony Gold Mining and Yamana Gold and neutral on Newmont Mining and AngloGoldAshanti. He suggested that investors interested in mining stocks diversify by buying exchange-traded funds that specialize in the sector. 
 INVESTMENT bank analysts appear more optimistic. Tony Lesiak at UBS has buy ratings on Newmont, Barrick Gold, Goldcorp, Agnico-Eagle Mines and Yamana.
 John Bridges at JPMorgan Chase assigns overweight ratings to Agnico-Eagle, Coeur d'Alene Mines, Goldcorp and Kinross Gold. He is neutral on Barrick and Newmont, the giants of North American gold mining.
 Peter Ward at Lehman Brothers is positive on the sector generally, but he advises underweighting Newmont and Barrick.
 Mr. Arnott seems to like gold much less than his peers. He finds it ''attractive as a diversifier because it's not correlated with mainstream stocks and bonds,'' but he owns none and says that ''it doesn't make sense as a core holding ever'' because almost every other investment returns more in the long run.
 As for gold mining shares, he reasons that they should outperform the commodity over long periods -- but not if gold's price is driven through the roof by the sort of unthinkable event gold bugs like to think about. ''I don't think planning on Armageddon is sensible, and if we have Armageddon, who are you going to sell your gold stocks to?''

HEADLINE: Two Bond Insurers End the Week Severely Weakened

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ; Julie Creswell and Michael J. de la Merced contributed reporting.

 BODY:
If it was a terrible week for Wall Street, it was a devastating one for companies that promise to protect investors against bond losses.
 Already under siege for having branched into risky mortgage-related debt from far safer municipal bonds, two bond guarantors -- who have insured hundreds of billions of dollars of debt -- ended the week in severely weakened conditions. 
 One insurer, Ambac Assurance, which lost nearly three-fourths of its stock market value in the first four days of the week, lost one of its most coveted assets on Friday: the AAA credit rating that has allowed it to guarantee lower-rated bonds. The company has guaranteed $556 billion in bonds, and about $66.9 billion of the amount is issued by collateralized debt obligations that have come under scrutiny in recent months. Altogether, bond guarantors have written nearly $3.3 trillion in insurance. 
 A smaller bond guarantor, ACA Financial Guaranty, was facing a midnight deadline to restructure its insurance contracts with investment banks or face a bankruptcy filing.
 Ambac, ACA and other bond guarantors are far from household names, but their troubles have sent ripples down Wall Street and Main Street. Bonds issued by states and governments that were insured by the companies have already lost value and the problems may raise the cost of new debt they raise. For investors and banks that have insured their portfolios with Ambac, its downgrade to AA, from AAA, by Fitch Ratings raises fresh questions about just what value the insurance holds, if any.
 ''The most damning effect is on the value of bond insurance itself,'' said Joseph R. Mason, a professor of finance at Drexel University and the Wharton School, both in Philadelphia. ''The big question that should be asked for issuers is: 'Why should I buy bond insurance?'<0>''
 Ambac, which had won clean bills of health from ratings agencies a month ago, surprised Wall Street on Wednesday by writing down its insurance portfolio by $5.4 billion and ousting its chief executive, Robert J. Genader, after he and the board disagreed over whether the company should raise more capital. 
 While much of the write-down was the result of declining market value of its contracts, the company admitted that an estimated $1.1 billion represented credit losses on which, over time, it would have to pay claims, something that the credit ratings firms had not anticipated.
 After initially saying it would raise capital to shore up its AAA ratings from Standard & Poor's, Moody's Investors Service and Fitch Ratings, Ambac reversed itself on Thursday after its stocks lost half their value and a big shareholder called on the company to give up on the AAA rating. A day later, Fitch lowered its rating and S.& P. put a ''negative'' outlook on the company. Analysts say a downgrade from Moody's and S.& P. would now seem likely. 
 ''They blew it and lost their window of opportunity to raise capital,'' Rob Haines, an analyst at CreditSights, a research firm, said about Ambac.
 A spokesman for Ambac declined to comment.
 Shares of Ambac closed down 4 cents, to $6.20 on Friday; they fell more than 70 percent for the week, from $21.73.
 Mr. Haines said the downgrade did not mean that Ambac was insolvent. While the company will not be able to write many of the insurance contracts it used to before, it can ''plod along'' by collecting premiums on its existing contracts and pay out claims as bond defaults occur. Fortunately for the company, it only makes payments on lost interest and principal on the debt it insures as it comes due, not all at once when a default occurs.
 ''Even though this is a big, big negative,'' Mr. Haines said, ''it doesn't mean it's going to go out of business, policyholders can't pull contracts.''
 Customers who have bought insurance protection from Ambac will have to decide whether they should write down the value of that guarantee or sell the underlying bonds. Investors that are required to only own AAA-rated debt may have to sell Ambac insured bonds that no longer have that top implied rating.
 ''Investment funds, pension funds just flat out refuse to hold anything that is not AAA,'' Mr. Mason said.
 The New York Insurance Department, which oversees Ambac and MBIA, the nation's largest bond guarantor, has been holding daily meetings with the companies, according to a spokesman, David Neustadt. 
 ''As a regulator we have to be a facilitator'' of several solutions, including a possible bailout, Eric R. Dinallo, the state's insurance superintendent, said at a news conference before the Fitch downgrade. ''That's our No. 1 goal.''
 ACA, which only had a single-A credit rating that was cut to CCC last month, is in a tougher position. Its insurance contracts require it to post collateral when the value of its contracts, or credit default swaps, fall. The company would have to put up at least $1.7 billion, money the company does not have. The company has ceded significant control to the Maryland Insurance Administration, a state agency that regulates it.
 Shares of ACA Capital were up 2 cents, to 48 cents, in over-the-counter trading.

PERSON: Bobby Fischer 

HEADLINE: Bobby Fischer, Troubled Genius of Chess, Is Dead

BYLINE: By BRUCE WEBER; Graham Bowley contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Bobby Fischer, the Chicago-born, Brooklyn-bred genius who became one of the greatest chess players the world has ever seen, died Thursday in Reykjavik, Iceland. He was 64, and had for decades lived in obscurity, ultimately settling in Reykjavik after renouncing his American citizenship.
 His death was confirmed Friday by Gardar Sverrisson, a close friend of Mr. Fischer's. The cause was kidney failure, Mr. Sverrisson told wire services. Mr. Fischer was said to have been ill at home for some time before being admitted to the hospital on Wednesday. 
 Mr. Fischer was the most powerful American player in history, and the most enigmatic. After scaling the heights of fame, he all but dropped out of chess, losing money and friends and living under self-imposed exile in Budapest, Japan, possibly in the Philippines and Switzerland, and finally in Iceland, moving there in 2005 and becoming a citizen.
 When he emerged now and then, it was sometimes on the radio, ranting in increasingly belligerent terms against the United States and Jews. His rationality was questioned. 
 In 1992, he came out of a long seclusion for a $5 million rematch against his old nemesis, the Russian-born grandmaster Boris Spassky. The match, in Yugoslavia, commemorated the 20th anniversary of the two men's monumental meeting in Reykjavik and Mr. Fischer's most glorious triumph. 
 Mr. Fischer won the rematch handily, but it was a sad reprise of their face-off in the summer of 1972. 
 In that earlier encounter, Mr. Fischer wrested the world championship from the elegant Mr. Spassky to become the first and, as yet, only American to win the title, one that Soviet-born players had held for more than four decades. It was the cold war fought with chess pieces in an out-of-the-way place.
 Mr. Fischer won with such brilliance and dramatic flair that he became an unassailable representative of greatness in the world of competitive games, much as Babe Ruth had been and Michael Jordan would become. 
 ''It was Bobby Fischer who had, single-handedly, made the world recognize that chess on its highest level was as competitive as football, as thrilling as a duel to the death, as aesthetically satisfying as a fine work of art, as intellectually demanding as any form of human activity,'' Harold C. Schonberg, who reported on the Reykjavik match for The New York Times, wrote in his 1973 book ''Grandmasters of Chess.''
 The rematch 20 years later drew no such plaudits. By participating, Mr. Fischer defied an American ban on conducting business in Yugoslavia as it waged war on Bosnia. After dispatching Mr. Spassky, Mr. Fischer dropped out of sight again, partly to avoid arrest on American charges stemming from his appearance. He stayed in touch with a dwindling number of friends in the United States by phone, compelling them to keep his secrets or risk his rejection. 
 In 2004, he was seized by the Japanese authorities when he tried to board a plane to Manila and accused of trying to leave the country on an invalid passport. He was detained in prison for nine months while the various governments and his supporters in the chess world tried to resolve the issue. 
 In 1999, in a series of telephone interviews with a radio station in the Philippines, he rambled angrily and profanely about an international Jewish conspiracy, which he said was bent on destroying him personally and the world generally. 
 On Sept. 11, 2001, he told a radio talk-show host in Baguio, the Philippines, that the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon were ''wonderful news.'' His wished for a time, he said, ''where the country will be taken over by the military, they'll close down all the synagogues, arrest all the Jews and execute hundreds of thousands of Jewish ringleaders.''
 Even in his years of triumph, Mr. Fischer was volatile and difficult. During the 1972 world championship match against Mr. Spassky, Mr. Fischer's petulance, even loutishness, was the stuff of front page headlines all over the globe. Incensed by the conditions under which the match was to be played -- he was particularly offended by the whir of television cameras in the hall -- he lost the first game, then forfeited the second and insisted that the remaining games be played in an isolated room.
 There, he roared back from what, in chess, is a sizable deficit, trouncing Mr. Spassky, 12 1/2 to 8 1/2. (In championship chess, a victory is worth one point for each player, a draw a half-point.) In all, Mr. Fischer won 7 games, lost 3 (including the forfeit) and drew 11.
 Through July and most of August 1972, the attention of the world was riveted on the Spassky-Fischer match. Americans who didn't know a Ruy Lopez from a Poisoned Pawn watched a hitherto unknown commentator named Shelby Lyman explain each game on public television.
 All this was Mr. Fischer's doing. Bobby Fischer -- the rebel, the enfant terrible, the uncompromising savage of the chess board -- had captured the imagination of the world. Because of him, for the first time in the United States, the game, with all its arcana and intimations of nerdiness, was cool. And when the championship match was over, he walked away with a winner's purse of $250,000, a sum that staggered anyone associated with chess. When Mr. Spassky won the world championship, his prize had been $1,400.
 Trouble With Celebrity
 Mr. Fischer's victory was widely seen as a symbolic triumph of democracy over communism, and it turned the new champion into an unlikely American hero. He was invited to the White House by President Richard M. Nixon, interviewed on television, wooed unsuccessfully by commercial interests. Sales of chess sets skyrocketed; so did fees for chess lessons. 
 But Mr. Fischer was incapable of sustaining himself in the limelight, and by the beginning of 1973, he had withdrawn into the weird, contrarian solitude he maintained more or less for the rest of his life. He turned down huge financial offers to play, among them a bid of $1.4 million from the Hilton Corporation to defend his title in Las Vegas. The dictator Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines and the Shah of Iran offered even larger sums for matches in their countries. Mr. Fischer said the money was not enough. 
 At the same time, he tithed to the Worldwide Church of God, a fringe church he had become involved with beginning in the early 1960s. (He later abandoned it.) For a time, Mr. Fischer lived in Pasadena, Calif., the church's home base, or in Los Angeles, where he was said to spend his time replaying chess games and reading Nazi literature. There were reports that he was destitute, though the state of his finances was never clear. 
 In chess circles, rumors surfaced intermittently that he was about to make a comeback. He invented a new kind of chess clock. He began railing to other chess players that computers had ruined the mystery of chess. He advocated a variation on the game in which pieces on the back rank, at the start, are lined up randomly. 
 A man of narrow interests but great intellectual gifts -- he reportedly had an I.Q. of 181 -- Mr. Fischer was a demanding personality (charismatic to some, merely infuriating to others) who seemed to feel that his prowess in chess entitled him to exorbitant privilege. He demanded loyalty from his supporters, concessions from his opponents, special treatment from tournament organizers and unalloyed respect from the world at large.
 It was an outlook that became ever more skewed. In the end his self-involvement was his undoing, isolating him from all but the most obsequious chess-world worshipers.
 Introduction to the Game
 Robert James Fischer was born in Chicago on March 9, 1943. While his father was variously listed as Gerard, Gerhard or Gerhardt Fischer, a German-born physicist, there is also credible evidence that his father might have been a Hungarian emigre who worked in a naval research laboratory.
 He and his wife, the former Regina Wender, divorced when Bobby was 2. Shortly thereafter, the elder Mr. Fischer left the United States for good, and Bobby and his older sister, Joan, were reared by their mother, a Swiss-born registered nurse and schoolteacher.
 Regina Fischer moved her family first to California and then to Arizona before settling in a Brooklyn walkup, where Bobby grew up. The strong-willed Mrs. Fischer, who would become a forceful advocate of pacifist causes, had an uneven influence on her willful son. When he was a teenager, she tried to dissuade him from concentrating solely on chess. But she also helped raise money for him to compete in tournaments.
 Mrs. Fischer was Jewish, and her son developed a hatred of Jews that became more virulent as he grew older. But mother and son evidently kept in touch over the years, and when she died in 1997, Mr. Fischer was said to have been distraught. His sister died soon afterward, and acquaintances of Mr. Fischer speculated that the two losses further taxed his fragile hold on rationality. He never married, but had a daughter, Jinky Ong, in 2000 with a companion, Justine Ong, in Manila. The child is his only immediate survivor.
 It was his sister, Joan, who bought Bobby, then age 6, his first chess set and taught him the basic moves. By 8 he was taking lessons at the Brooklyn Chess Club; by 12 he was holding his own among America's strongest players, who gathered at the Manhattan Chess Club and the Marshall Chess Club. His adult opponents called him ''the Boy Robot'' and ''the Corduroy Killer,'' for his unwavering wardrobe and insatiable will to win.
 In 1956, when he was 13, Mr. Fischer became the youngest player ever to win the United States Junior Championship. The same year, at the Lessing J. Rosenwald Trophy Tournament, the most important invitational tournament in the country at the time, he created his first masterpiece in defeating the international master Donald Byrne. The Chess Review called it ''The Game of the Century,'' as it is still known today.
 The next year he not only repeated as winner of the United States Junior Championship but also captured the first of his eight United States Championships, becoming at 14 the youngest person ever to hold the title. No less impressive was the manner of his victory -- in 13 games against the best players in America, he had a score of 8 wins, 5 draws and no losses.
 The next year he became, at 15, the youngest person until then to attain the rank of grandmaster, the game's highest designation of skill. He attended Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn, but, indifferent to classes because they took time away from chess, he dropped out at 16.
 Aggressive, and 'Brilliant'
 At the chessboard he was renowned as a pitiless attacker. ''I love to see them squirm,'' he said of his opponents. From early on, he buttressed his penchant for original thinking with monumental study and he became known for his mastery of the game's literature. 
 He favored strategies like the King's Gambit, an opening maneuver in which White sacrifices a kingside pawn to get a quick attack. It had long been dismissed as too risky and romantic. But Mr. Fischer used it in spectacular fashion during the 1964 United States Championship in a game against the grandmaster Larry Evans. It was part of perhaps the greatest tournament performance ever, in which Mr. Fischer won 11 games, losing and drawing none. ''He blew the chess world away,'' said the chess teacher and writer Bruce Pandolfini.
 The 1964 tournament also produced another of his legendary games, this one against the grandmaster Robert Byrne. 
 ''It was one of his brilliant counterattacks,'' recalled Mr. Byrne, who would go on to become the chess columnist for The New York Times. ''He was playing Black, and he made a deep sacrifice, so deep that I did not understand it. It was a very profound combination, very beautiful.'' 
 Mr. Byrne ended up resigning the game while he was still materially ahead. The result was so unusual that it confounded grandmasters analyzing the games for spectators.
 Moving Beyond Eccentric
 Mr. Fischer had always been brash, but by the early 1960s his self-regard had ballooned. He told Harper's magazine that women could not be great chess players. Mr. Byrne recalled that at a tournament in Bulgaria in 1962 he suggested to Mr. Fischer that he see a psychiatrist. Mr. Fischer said a psychiatrist ought to pay him for the privilege of working on his brain. 
 He began making outlandish demands on tournament directors -- for special lighting, special seating, special conditions to ensure quiet. He complained that opponents were trying to poison his food, that his hotel rooms were bugged, that Russians were colluding at tournaments and prearranging draws. He began to fear flying because he thought the Russians might hide booby traps on the plane. 
 He played less and less, withdrawing from competition for months at a time, fueling gossip that he was afraid to lose, but always returning to play at a level no one could equal. At one point, before the Spassky match in Reykjavik, he won 20 consecutive games against grandmasters. He also completed ''My 60 Memorable Chess Games'' (1969), a classic collection that remains required reading for serious players.
 He earned his shot at the world champion, Mr. Spassky, when he soundly defeated another Russian, Tigran Petrosian. Now, in Reykjavik, Mr. Fischer had a world stage, and he seized the spotlight with his 6-foot-2 frame -- broad-shouldered, angular and fit in bespoke suits -- casting an imposing shadow. 
 He was imperious and, to some, insufferable. In the days before the match, he threatened to not show up and delayed his departure from New York. He insisted on television coverage, then refused to play for the cameras because he said he could hear them. He lost the first game on a blunder, then forfeited Game 2; then he threatened to withdraw entirely unless Mr. Spassky agreed to move play to a small room, away from the audience.
 ''He drove the organizers of the tournament to despair,'' Fred Waitzkin wrote in ''Searching for Bobby Fischer,'' his 1988 book about the chess world, which became the basis for a 1993 movie.
 In the end, though, Mr. Fischer was brilliant in Reykjavik, and when it was over, he was a legend: the American who beat the Russians at their own game. 
 During the match he had allowed a reporter for Life magazine, Brad Darrach, to spend time with him. Mr. Darrach produced a favorable article for the magazine but followed it with a biography, ''Bobby Fischer vs. the Rest of the World,'' which portrayed Mr. Fischer as a monomaniac and a monster. 
 Mr. Fischer brought suit, and after a long battle, he lost. By then he had received a fresh blow from the chess establishment. The International Chess Federation (known by its French acronym as FIDE) stripped him of his title in 1975 when he refused to play the rightful challenger, Anatoly Karpov, under federation rules. His life had begun its downward spiral. After an unsuccessful lawsuit against members of the Worldwide Church, he was apparently broke and homeless.
 ''The rare accounts of his situation all mention cheap rooms in Pasadena and L.A., months of his crashing on former friends and days spent riding the orange city bus between L.A. and Pasadena, analyzing chess games on his pocket set,'' Ivan Solotaroff wrote in Esquire magazine in 1992.
 Chess players generally think that Mr. Fischer agreed to the 1992 Spassky match for the money. But the opportunity to reassert his primacy was apparently attractive as well. The games were played in a surreal atmosphere in Sveti Stefan, a resort in the Yugoslav republic of Montenegro, just a few miles from the bloody warfare then raging in Bosnia. The $5 million purse was put up by a Serbian wheeler-dealer named Jezdimir Vasiljevic. 
 Although the match was unsanctioned, a banner was put up proclaiming it to be the world chess championship. At a press conference, Mr. Fischer held up a letter from the Treasury Department warning him that his participation in the match, considered an economic project, would constitute defiance of American sanctions against Yugoslavia. He would be subject to fine and arrest, he was told. In front of more than 150 reporters, he spat on the letter and ranted on against Jews and Russians.
 Decades after Mr. Fischer faded into his oblivion, stories of Fischer sightings were traded as currency by chess players, and the debate -- how would he have fared against Garry Kasparov, the great champion of the 1980s and 1990s? -- echoed at tournaments and in chess publications. 
 ''After 1972, we lost so many great pieces of art,'' said Mr. Pandolfini, the chess teacher, ''hundreds of masterpieces he would have created if he had stayed a sane being. We feel the great loss. All chess players do.''

CORRECTION-DATE: January 24, 2008

 CORRECTION:
A front-page obituary on Saturday about the American chess champion Bobby Fischer misstated the length of time Soviet-born players had held the title of world champion before Mr. Fischer wrested it from Boris Spassky in 1972. It was 35 years, not ''more than four decades.'' The obituary also misstated the nationality of another champion, Tigran Petrosian, whom Mr. Fischer defeated to advance to the championship match against Mr. Spassky. Mr. Petrosian was born in Georgia of Armenian descent; he was not Russian.

HEADLINE: What's Behind Those Offers to Raise Credit Scores

BYLINE: By JANET MORRISSEY

 BODY:
A HOST of companies have cropped up in the last year that offer struggling subprime mortgage holders quick-fix programs aimed at raising their credit scores.
 Some of their methods include piggy-backing onto a stranger's credit card and receiving pay stubs from a fake employer. The latest comes from a San Diego company, TradeLine Solutions, which claims it can improve a borrower's credit score by adding somebody else's top-notch credit history to the borrower's history. 
 But industry trade groups and consumer advocates warn borrowers to be wary of that program as well as others that play off borrowers' fears that they will lose their homes when mortgage rates reset to significantly higher levels. 
 For a $1,399 fee, TradeLine adds the borrower's name to a stranger's recently paid-off loan just before the account is closed. The account, with its perfect payment history, is then added to the borrower's credit record in 30 to 45 days. 
 Ted Stearns, chief executive of TradeLine Solutions, said he came up with what the company calls its ''seasoned primary accounts'' program using a ''loophole'' in the law. Adding a single account can raise a credit score by 35 to 40 points, he said. But most clients purchase three accounts, at $1,399 for the first one and slight discounts for subsequent ones, to increase a score from say 560 to 700, he said. 
 The program's concept, he said, is similar to someone's buying a car and taking over somebody else's car loan or lease account at the time of purchase -- except, in this case, there is no balance on the account. The original borrower is unaware that a new name is being attached to the account, he said. Mr. Stearns defended his program. ''I am a legal entity that conducts business throughout the state of California and the entire continental U.S.''
 But Craig Watts, consumer affairs manager at the credit analysis firm Fair Isaac Corporation, said the program raised red flags. 
 ''They're falsifying the person's credit history, and that's one definition of loan fraud,'' Mr. Watts said. Even if TradeLine has found a legal loophole to offer the program, the people using the program are knowingly raising their credit scores artificially when applying for a loan or refinancing, he said, adding, ''If the borrower is deliberately misrepresenting himself and his credentials to the lender, that's loan fraud.'' 
 Mr. Watts said that if law enforcement officials chose to prosecute, borrowers could potentially risk losing far more than just their homes. 
 Fair Isaac developed the FICO scores, which are the most widely used scores for assessing credit risk. It recently fine-tuned its formula, Mr. Watts said, to shut down another credit-enhancing scheme. 
 He emphasized in an interview that his firm is not a law enforcement agency, but would bring concerns to the attention of the Justice Department, Federal Trade Commission, the F.B.I. and attorney general's office if lenders started complaining about such practices. 
 George Hanzimanolis, president of the National Association of Mortgage Brokers, expressed similar concerns. 
 ''You're representing something to be true that is not,'' he said. ''Artificially increasing the scores to make them look like they're creditworthy is a road to disaster.'' 
 Mr. Hanzimanolis said companies that seemingly offer help to individual borrowers might actually be making matters worse. He said he was concerned that many of these loans might wind up becoming delinquent later because they involve people with poor credit. When this happens, he said, the whole industry could suffer. 
 ''There's no way anybody would be able to determine what customers' true credit profiles looked like,'' he said. ''Then we'll have more homes going into foreclosure, which will end up driving home prices down across the country and affecting banks, consumers -- everybody.''
 The F.T.C. and other federal agencies declined to comment on the programs or to say whether any investigations were under way. 
 ''Investigations are nonpublic and we don't opine over whether something is legal or not,'' said Frank Dorman, public affairs specialist with the F.T.C. 
 Fair Isaac has already taken steps to crack down on another credit repair program that TradeLine and a number of other companies, including Instant CreditBuilders.com and SeasonedTradeLines.com, began offering in the last year. 
 Under this program, subprime borrowers are added as ''authorized users'' onto credit cards belonging to strangers with strong credit scores and reliable payment histories. Each credit card could add about 35 points to a credit score. SeasonedTradeLines.com's Web site says: ''There is one secret the credit scoring granddaddy and the credit bureaus do not want you to know: Good credit scores can be bought!'' 
 Last spring, lenders began complaining to Fair Isaac that this program, known as credit piggy-backing, would undercut the credibility of credit scores, Mr. Watts said. As a result, Fair Isaac, after consulting with lenders and federal regulatory officials, decided to change its scoring formula to ignore ''authorized users'' when tallying a person's FICO score. The formula change is expected to take effect at two of the credit bureaus -- Experian and Trans Union -- by this spring, Mr. Watts said. 
 ''Authorized user accounts will still show up on credit reports obviously, but the FICO score will no longer see them,'' he said. 
 Mr. Hanzimanolis said he was not surprised that companies were offering schemes to tap into homeowners' fears and desperation in light of the subprime credit crisis. 
 ''If this kind of practice isn't stopped, I think it's going to be a disaster,'' he said.
 Economists are predicting another wave of rate resets in the next year, involving homeowners who took out subprime mortgages, adjustable-rate mortgages and hybrids from 2003 to 2005. Kathy Bostjancic, a Merrill Lynch senior economist, predicts the biggest impact from a dollar perspective will come in the third quarter of 2008. ''We've only seen maybe the first wave or two impact, and there's more to come,'' she said. 
 Mr. Stearns acknowledged that the FICO formula change would have an impact on his authorized user accounts program and said that was one reason he started his company's ''seasoned primary accounts'' program. ''We're always one to look for loopholes in the system,'' he said. 
 Mr. Watts said it was too early to tell whether steps would be taken to close the loophole on TradeLine's latest program. 
 ''If lenders tell us they have concerns about a new type of practice or new type of threat, then we'll do everything we can to help them with it.''
 Is Mr. Stearns concerned?
 ''It would be presumptuous of me to state that I know what big blunder the credit bureaus have in store for consumers,'' he said. ''I do know that at this time our program serves as a useful antidote to the current subprime crisis.''

HEADLINE: Oil Demand, the Climate and the Energy Ladder

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
Energy demand is expected to grow in coming decades. Jeroen van der Veer, 60, Royal Dutch Shell's chief executive, recently offered his views on the energy challenge facing the world and the challenge posed by global warming. He spoke of the need for governments to set limits on carbon emissions. He also lifted the veil on Shell's latest long-term energy scenarios, titled Scramble and Blueprints, which he will make public next week at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Following are excerpts from the interview:
 Q.What are the main findings of Shell's two scenarios? 
 A. Scramble is where key actors, like governments, make it their primary focus to do a good job for their own country. So they look after their self-interest and try to optimize within their own boundaries what they try to do. Blueprints is basically all the international initiatives, like Kyoto, like Bali, or like a future Copenhagen. They start very slowly but before not too long they become relatively successful. This is a model of international cooperation.
 Q.Your first scenario looks very similar to today's world, with energy nationalism, competition for resources and little attention to consumption.
 A. It depends where you live. I realize there are different opinions about Kyoto in the world. But if you think about Bali, Bali is a good outcome if people can agree how to have useful discussion in the coming two years and the United States, China and India are on board. The Blueprints world is maybe a world that starts slowly and is not that easily feasible, but you see some early indicators that it is a realistic possibility. 
 Q.The world seems to be at some form of inflection point with a big shift in demand.
 A. The basic drivers are pretty easy and they are twofold. You go from six billion people to nine billion people basically in 2050. This combination of many more people climbing the energy ladder, which is basically welfare for a lot of people who live in poverty, creates that enormous demand for energy. 
 Q.How will the demand be fulfilled?
 A. Many politicians think we have to make a choice between fossil fuels and renewables. We have to grow both fossil fuels and renewables. And that will be a huge effort for both.
 Q.More energy means more carbon emissions. How do you deal with that?
 A. That is absolutely the crux of the matter. The principal way we see is that in the very short term, man-made carbon emissions will increase. But over time people will figure out ways -- and we work very hard on that -- that while using fossil fuels you try to find carbon dioxide solutions. For instance, carbon sequestration. The problem is that many of the renewables, if you take the subsidies out, are still too expensive. That is the dilemma we face now.
 Q. Fossil fuels are still going to represent the lion's share of the energy mix in the next century?
 A. First, there is no lack in itself of oil or gas, or coal for that matter. But the problem is that the easy-to-produce oil or easy-to-produce gas will be depleted or with difficult access. But if you look at difficult oil or difficult gas, which we in the industry call the unconventionals, such as oil sands or shales, they may be exploitable. But per barrel, you need a lot more technology and a lot more investments, and per barrel you need a lot more brain to produce it. It's much more expensive.
 Q.What kind of alternatives can compete?
 A. The competition is partly true competition -- markets, inventions -- and part of it is governments. I think if you can price carbon dioxide, probably you can stimulate carbon capture and sequestration. If you tax a certain form of energy, over time it gets more expensive and you may use less of it.
 Q.It still seems there is a gap that is hard to bridge.
 A. If carbon is the real bottleneck, as a world it makes sense that we use our money where we get the biggest reduction for the lowest cost. You get more carbon reduction for less money by tackling the power sector and maybe the building sector. 
 Q.It is still hard to see that people are willing to pay more for greener energy.
 A. I am a strong believer and strong advocate of free enterprise. If you would like to solve the carbon problem in the world, free enterprise has to work in close cooperation with governments to form the right framework. How you tackled the sulfur dioxide problem in the United States was the basic inspiration for the European trading system of carbon. So there are examples from the past we can apply to overcome that problem. But we can't do it on our own as an industry. We need cooperation from governments.
 Q.How close are we to an understanding globally that climate policy and energy policy are all interrelated issues?
 A. Thanks to Al Gore, and many others, the awareness is there. There is a kind of sense of urgency. Secondly, there is a preparedness to do things. Thirdly, do we agree who has to take what action? I think that is still a huge problem. 
 Q.There was a lot of disagreement at the Bali climate conference. 
 A. That is correct. I realize that Bali is still very difficult. I am not a pessimist. I see it as a very difficult start-up. The crux of the matter is, if the people say, ''Hang on, we are really concerned about the climate and we'd better do something on carbon emissions,'' that is in the end the powerful force which politicians and companies cannot ignore. And I think we are past that point.

Anthony M. Solomon, a former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and an influential behind-the-scenes financial policy maker in three presidential administrations and at the World Bank, died Friday at his home in Manhattan. He was 88.
 The cause was kidney failure, his son, Adam, said. 
 In the many powerful jobs he held, Mr. Solomon was known for dealing with the intertwined complexities of the American and foreign economies.
 ''I've got one of the best people in government working on this problem,'' President Jimmy Carter said of Mr. Solomon in November 1977 after naming him chairman of an interagency task force to support the distressed steel industry. 
 Two years later, Mr. Solomon played a central role in planning the freezing of Iranian financial assets after the overthrow of Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi. At the time, he was the Treasury Department's under secretary for monetary affairs. 
 Mr. Solomon usually fit the image of the tailored banker and bureaucrat. But away from the job, he preferred to wear a loose-fitting sweater and puff on a pipe as he chiseled semi-abstract sculptures. His interest in art led in the late 1980s to his becoming chairman of P.S. 1, the avant-garde art museum in Long Island City, Queens. 
 In 1969, Mr. Solomon was asked by Robert S. McNamara, then the president of the World Bank, to create the International Investment Corporation for Yugoslavia and to organize joint ventures between that country and Western enterprises. Mr. Solomon was president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, historically the most influential of the Federal Reserve system's 12 regional banks, from 1980 to 1985. At the New York Fed, he dealt with titans of American banking like David Rockefeller of Chase Manhattan and Walter B. Wriston of Citibank. He also played an important role shaping and carrying out the nation's domestic and international monetary policies. 
 It was a particularly trying time, with a debt crisis troubling much of the third world and even threatening the solvency of some of New York's largest banks. In 1984, at the urging of Paul A. Volcker -- the Federal Reserve Board chairman at the time and Mr. Solomon's predecessor as the New York Fed president -- Mr. Solomon worked to persuade banks to limit the amount of interest charged to financially troubled developing countries.
 Many loans, particularly to Latin American countries, were tied to the prime rate in the United States, which was then hovering around 12 percent. Mr. Solomon facilitated special lending arrangements with foreign countries while they worked out new financial arrangements with creditors.
 Born in Arlington, N.J., on Dec. 27, 1919, Mr. Solomon was one of three children of Jacob and Edna Yudin Solomon. His father owned a restaurant and bar. After graduating from the University of Chicago in 1941 with a bachelor's degree in economics, Mr. Solomon was hired by the War Department and sent to Iran, where he controlled construction of the roadway used to haul Lend-Lease supplies to Russia. 
 In 1948, Mr. Solomon received a master's degree in economics and public administration from Harvard and began working as a securities analyst. In 1950 he married Constance Kaufman, and the couple moved to Mexico. There Mr. Solomon started a food company and began selling an innovative product to Mexican housewives: dehydrated soups. Nine years later, General Foods bought the company, making the Solomons millionaires. 
 Mr. Solomon decided to enter public service. On the recommendation of the economist John Kenneth Galbraith, he was appointed deputy assistant secretary of state for Latin America in the Kennedy administration; he later rose to assistant secretary of state for economic affairs. 
 Mr. Solomon's wife died in 1998. Besides his son, Adam, of Manhattan, he is survived by a daughter, Tracy Ford. of San Rafael, Calif.; and two grandchildren.
 In 1986, after retiring from the Fed, Mr. Solomon became chairman of the investment banking firm S. G. Warburg (U.S.A.). That year, he was also named chairman of P.S. 1. 
 Mr. Solomon's interest in art had been kindled during professional stays in foreign countries, where he began collecting sculptures. 
 Collecting, however was less exciting to Mr. Solomon than creating. For more than 30 years, at his studio in Manhattan, he sculptured wood, bronze, terra-cotta and fiberglass figures. 
 ''I remember saying to my wife,'' he told The New York Times in 1987, ''<0> 'I'd like to do something that doesn't involve manipulating money or people.'<0>''

HEADLINE: Seeking Tools to Calm a Market

BYLINE: By JULIE CRESWELL; Michael S. Grynbaum contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Dow 6,000 or Dow 14,000? 
 It depends on whom you ask.
 A week of gut-wrenching losses in the stock market ended on Friday with the Dow Jones industrial average falling 59.91 points, to 12,099.30. That modest decline capped a four-day 678-point plunge that left Wall Street traders and everyday investors wondering if the worst was over -- or yet to come.
 David W. Tice, a renowned bear, said Friday that the Dow would sink to 6,000 by the end of the year as the country slides into a recession.
 But Abby Joseph Cohen, the superbull at Goldman Sachs, maintained that the Dow would roar back to finish 2008 at a level 22 percent higher -- 14,750 is the number -- as the economy perks up later in the year. 
 While their views diverge, both strategists agreed on one point: The wild ride is far from over. In whiplash trading, the Dow has fallen 14 percent from its peak in October. While the market has taken deeper dives in the past -- it plummeted 37.8 percent from January 2000 to October 2002, for example -- volatility is approaching its highest levels in several years.
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 8.06 points Friday, to 1,325.19, and is down 9.75 percent so far in 2008.
 The Nasdaq composite index declined 6.88 points Friday, to 2,340.02, and is down 11.77 percent so far in 2008. 
 Amid steep drops in the housing market, huge losses at Wall Street banks, rising energy prices and growing fears about a recession, this year is shaping up to be a tough one for the faint-of-heart. 
 ''The R-word is really scaring investors,'' said Leon Rousso, a certified financial planner in Ventura, Calif. ''I've been holding hands and comforting people to get through this and not to panic.''
 Yet some analysts warn the news could get much uglier. Earnings forecasts ''have gone down quite dramatically'' this year, said Michael Thompson, a managing director at Thomson Proprietary Research. 
 Analysts, already bracing for a wave of weak fourth-quarter earnings, have doubled their loss estimates since the year began. They now expect S.& P. 500 companies to report a 20 percent drop in earnings for the final three months of 2007, down from estimates of a 10 percent decline just three weeks ago. 
 Earnings forecasts for the first quarter of this year are being scaled back, too. On Jan. 2, analysts expected 5.7 percent growth in corporate profits. By Friday, that figure had been revised down to 4.1 percent. 
 Forecasts have been driven down by the poor performance of financial companies, which typically generate 25 percent of overall earnings growth in the S.& P. 500. Analysts now expect them to contribute 1 percent.
 ''All you're getting is baggage with these guys,'' Mr. Thompson said.
 And some worry the financial sector remains at risk for further losses. 
 ''What could cause greater economic losses or fallout in the market would be further recognized losses or downgrades in the financial sector,'' said Joe Davis, an economist at the mutual fund company Vanguard Group. ''That is the heart of the problem and where the greatest risks lie.''
 Indeed, while many of the world's largest financial institutions, including Citigroup, Mejrrill Lynch and UBS, have written down billions of dollars worth of securities linked to mortgages in recent weeks, some investors remain concerned that losses could grow if default levels continue to climb not only on mortgages, but also on credit card bills and auto loans.
 Making matters worse, there is mounting concern about the ability of companies that sell insurance for bonds, including MBIA and Ambac, to survive.
 On Friday, Fitch Ratings downgraded Ambac to a double-A credit from a triple-A credit. That move could have a major ripple effect on Wall Street because many banks and investors buy insurance from these companies to protect themselves from losses.
 ''Eventually, there is the possibility that there are so many defaults that these companies will not be able to meet the interest payments,'' said Rob Haines, a senior insurance analyst with the research firm CreditSights.
 Still, some investors are hanging their hopes for a rebound in the market on the Federal Reserve, which is expected to cut interest rates again by the end of the month. Some also hope that Washington can quickly cobble together a fiscal stimulus package that would give the economy a boost.
 On Friday, President Bush called for $145 billion in tax rebates for American families and incentives for businesses to keep the economy from sliding into recession. 
 While the details and timing of the stimulus plan remained sketchy, some on Wall Street welcomed the direction Washington was moving. 
 ''I believe there is a bipartisan belief that fiscal stimulus is needed. We just don't know what form Congress will eventually pass,'' Ms. Cohen said.
 For her part, Ms. Cohen believes her call for the Dow to end 2008 at 14,750 will stand because much of the bad economic news will come out in the next few months. ''But economic growth will be looking better by the end of '08 and into 2009,'' she added.
 Others clearly share that view. While the market has tumbled, some investors have looked at the pullback as an opportunity to increase their holdings. Vanguard, for instance, said it has had net inflows into its equity mutual funds so far this year. 
 ''I definitely tell some of my more aggressive clients that this is absolutely the time to buy,'' Mr. Rousso said. ''I don't tell all of my clients that -- especially the older ones -- but the younger ones should absolutely look at the market.''
 Likewise, Ms. Cohen said she has taken calls in recent days from pension funds, endowments and other investors with long-term investment strategies that are ''looking at interesting opportunities that are developing,'' she said. Interest is also rising in the United States stock market by foreign investors and corporations whose strong currencies make American investments even cheaper, she said.
 Moves by Congress and the Federal Reserve over the next few weeks could very well determine whether the economy slides into a full-blown recession and the markets continue to be pummeled by bad news, said Mr. Davis of Vanguard. 
 ''There are a lot of wild cards out there right now, including rate cuts by the Federal Reserve and what a tax stimulus package could look like,'' Mr. Davis said. ''I do not think it is too late to prevent a recession, but we are at a critical juncture.''

HEADLINE: New York Settles On Far More Modest Expansion of Javits Convention Center

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
Thirteen months and $30 million after the Spitzer administration said it would conduct a 90-day review of longstanding expansion plans for the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, the state has come up with a new, far less ambitious proposal that major users of the center say is disappointing.
 The latest plan, which has been the subject of rumors for months and was disclosed Friday, calls for a substantial renovation of the center, a leaky, black-glass convention hall along 11th Avenue between 34th and 38th Streets. But it proposes only a modest addition of at most 100,000 square feet of meeting and exhibition space, down from more than half a million square feet in an earlier proposal. 
 It does not add up to the ''thoroughbred'' of a convention center that Gov. Eliot Spitzer promised last spring. State officials say the scaled-down plan will let them stay within the remaining funds for the project, about $1.6 billion.
 In a surprise move, the state also plans to sell an entire block owned by the Javits Center -- bound by 39th and 40th Streets, between 11th and 12th Avenues -- foreclosing any possibility of a possible second phase of the expansion. 
 The state plans to pour the proceeds from that sale into other economic development projects, including, possibly, the recently inaugurated extension of the No. 7 subway line from Times Square to 34th Street and 11th Avenue, near the Javits Center.
 The state is also considering plans for a convention hotel on 11th or 12th Avenue, between 38th and 39th Streets, where the additional space would be built, along with a truck garage and a truck security screening operation. If that happens, the state would scrap an earlier proposal to build a hotel across 11th Avenue from the Javits Center, between 35th and 36th Streets. 
 The Legislature would have to approve the sale of the 40th Street block, and rezoning the property requires city approval.
 Patrick J. Foye, co-chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation and the top state official overseeing the Javits Center, said he was ''very comfortable'' in saying the state could complete this project within budget. The plan also seems to reflect state officials' view that a bigger convention center is no longer critical to the city's economy.
 The state hopes to raise as much as $800 million from the sale of the 40th Street block, as well as a second parcel, between 33rd and 34th Streets.
 The state's plans drew mixed reviews. 
 Trade show producers and others who use the Javits Center expressed dismay. They fear that New York has turned its back on the convention industry, which had asked for more exhibition space to attract larger shows.
 ''We're disappointed,'' said Ken McAvoy, senior vice president of Reed Exhibitions. ''We were hoping for more exhibition space.''
 Senator Charles E. Schumer, who has long pushed for doubling the size of the Javits Center, was more critical.
 ''I have a great deal of sympathy for Governor Spitzer because his predecessor left him a bag of lemons, out of which it's impossible to make lemonade,'' Mr. Schumer said. ''But this small amount of expansion space for that much money makes this the worst public real estate deal since the Tweed Courthouse.''
 Joseph E. Spinnato, president of the Hotel Association of New York City, expressed support, saying, ''They're doing what we recommended.'' Once an ardent proponent of an expanded convention center, the hotel association recently balked at the state's request to increase the $1.50-a-night room tax for the expansion in order to pay for a larger project.
 City officials, who have long been eager to start the project, said they were just beginning to assess the latest proposal Friday. 
 ''We're reviewing the plans now,'' said Robert C. Lieber, deputy mayor for economic development. ''We just want to understand all the implications.''
 Even before the new plan was unveiled, Mr. Foye had come under criticism from trade show and hotel industry executives and some legislators for his handling of the expansion plan and the lengthy review, at a time when construction costs for a project this size were rising at about $17 million a month. 
 Mr. Foye said he had been stuck with an expensive and unworkable plan developed by Charles A. Gargano, former Gov. George E. Pataki's top economic development official, and by Daniel L. Doctoroff, former deputy mayor for economic development. It was supposed to cost $1.8 billion.
 ''It was way above the budget and not something that the state, the city, Javits users or the hotel industry wanted to support,'' Mr. Foye said. ''We reviewed about 15 variations to deal with the dilemma we inherited.''
 In 2004, the Legislature approved a plan to expand the Javits Center to 1.3 million square feet of exhibit and meeting space from 790,000 square feet. Proponents said that a larger hall would attract more visitors, who would book hotel rooms, eat in restaurants and go to Broadway shows. 
 The city and state each agreed to provide $350 million for the project, while the hotel industry agreed to the imposition of the hotel-room tax, which enabled the state to raise $645 million from a bond offering.
 The proposal, however, was criticized by trade show producers and operators who complained that the new configurations would drive up costs and discourage shows from booking the space. As time passed, the project's cost swelled to $1.8 billion, from $1.4 billion, while the size of the expansion shrunk.
 Beginning a year ago, the Spitzer administration attempted to address those complaints and to look at an even larger expansion over the railyards south of the Javits Center. Despite the governor's ambition, state officials say they found that the actual cost of the original project was closer to $3 billion, and that the larger ''thoroughbred'' plan, as Governor Spitzer described it, would have cost $5 billion.
 Those numbers were prohibitive, and some hotel operators in New York, where occupancy rates have been at record levels, now say that conventions account for no more than 8 percent of the annual revenue at West Side hotels.
 So the Spitzer administration is now proposing a small addition of up to 60,000 square feet of additional meeting rooms and up to 40,000 square feet of exhibit space. The space would connect to the current building and be on the block between 38th and 39th Streets.

HEADLINE: Kenya's Opposition Switches Its Tactics From Street Protests to Business Boycotts

BYLINE: By JEFFREY GETTLEMAN; Kennedy Abwao contributed reporting.

DATELINE: NAIROBI, Kenya 

 BODY:
Protests cooled in Kenya on Friday as opposition leaders, still furious about last month's presidential election, announced that they were switching tactics from street demonstrations to boycotts.
 After three days of nationwide rallies that degenerated into battles with police officers, the country was mostly calm, save for a few flash points. Witnesses said police officers shot and killed at least two people in Kibera, a huge slum on the outskirts of Nairobi, the capital. Earlier in the day, vandals uprooted a length of train tracks running through Kibera, where a freight train was looted Thursday.
 In Narok, a town near the Masai Mara game reserve, ethnic clashes erupted with men battling in the streets, using bows and arrows and machetes. Witnesses said at least five people were killed, and a Kenyan television network showed images of men dancing around a body in Narok's downtown. 
 In Mombasa, Kenya's second-largest city and a major port for East Africa, hundreds of protesters emerged from mosques to call for a new election. Police officers responded with tear gas and gunshots. Witnesses said at least one person was killed, bringing the deaths from the week's disturbances to more than 20, including several children.
 The zero-tolerance policy of the Kenyan police is drawing increasing criticism. Western diplomats in Nairobi have urged the government to allow peaceful rallies --currently banned -- and to stop using lethal force against unarmed demonstrators. 
 Opposition leaders and their supporters have been protesting the elections in December in which Mwai Kibaki, Kenya's president, was declared the winner by a narrow margin over Raila Odinga, the top opposition leader, amid widespread evidence that election officials had tampered with results.
 On Friday, a consortium of Kenyan election monitors and human rights groups announced that there had been so many glaring irregularities in the balloting that it was impossible to tell who had really won, a position echoed by American diplomats who have done their own analysis. The consortium issued a report called ''Countdown to Deception: 30 Hours That Destroyed Kenya.''
 David Ndii, a researcher for the anticorruption group Transparency International, said that election officials had siphoned away votes for Mr. Odinga and increased the number of votes for Mr. Kibaki during the tallying process. ''The suspicious votes are sufficient to alter the outcome of the presidential elections,'' Mr. Ndii said.
 It is unclear how much impact this will have because Mr. Kibaki and his tight circle of advisers have insisted that the president won the election fairly and that there will be no rerun.
 As for the boycotts, Salim Lone, a spokesman for Mr. Odinga, said the plan was to focus on businesses owned by Mr. Kibaki's allies, like one of Kenya's biggest dairies and a bus company in Nairobi. ''The strategy is to weaken those who are hard-liners and using their wealth to undermine democracy,'' he said.
 The government has said that Kenya's economy, which up until last month was the dynamo of East Africa, has been hurt enough. Tourists are leaving, much trade has been blocked and the currency is weakening. ''Let us please leave private businesses out of politics,'' was the message that Alfred Mutua, a government spokesman, sent via cellphones on Friday.
 Police officials on Friday arrested three foreign journalists, including a filmmaker following Mr. Odinga, on charges of terrorism after accusing them of filming vital installations.

HEADLINE: BUSH PROPOSING $145 BILLION PLAN TO SPUR ECONOMY

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG; Carl Hulse, Steven Lee Myers and Edmund L. Andrews contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Bush called Friday for roughly $145 billion in tax relief for individuals and businesses that he said would ''provide a shot in the arm'' for the economy, while Congressional Democrats, in a rare show of Washington bipartisanship, pledged to work with him to enact a plan quickly.
 Mr. Bush laid out his ideas for an economic rescue package only in broad strokes, saying the plan must be ''built on broad-based tax relief'' and ''big enough to make a difference in an economy as large and dynamic as ours.'' He did not use the word recession, but acknowledged that ''there is a risk of a downturn.''
 His comments, in the Roosevelt Room of the White House, reflected a heightened sense of urgency within the administration and on Capitol Hill about the need to stimulate spending in an economy shaken by higher gas prices and instability in the housing and credit markets. 
 Though the details must still be negotiated, both the White House and Congressional Democrats are leaning heavily toward a combination similar to the one the administration turned to in 2001 as a recession-fighting tool. It would include a one-time tax rebate for individuals and an immediate expansion in the deductions that businesses take for investment in equipment. If Congress acts quickly, checks could be in the hands of American taxpayers as early as spring.
 Still, there will be sticking points. In laying the foundation for a plan rooted in tax policy, Mr. Bush held fast to a central theme of his presidency, that cutting taxes, rather than increasing spending, was the route to prosperity. Democrats, by contrast, supported an extension of unemployment benefits, coupled with tax breaks aimed at the middle class. Some reacted warily, even as they praised Mr. Bush.
 ''We want a balanced package: a tax rebate for the middle class and spending stimulus that jump-starts this economy quickly,'' Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, told reporters. 
 In declining to offer specifics, Mr. Bush acceded to the wishes of the Senate Democratic leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, who had asked him during a conference call on Thursday not to lay out a formal proposal before Democrats had a chance to coalesce around theirs. Administration officials were assiduous on Friday about refusing to comment on details, including a report that the rebate would be set at $800 for individuals and $1,600 for couples.
 ''I don't want to play, 'Is it bigger than a breadbox?'<0>'' Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. told reporters, adding that Mr. Bush intentionally did not release details ''because we're looking to be collaborative in working with Congress here.''
 In setting his parameters, Mr. Bush said the package should be about 1 percent of the gross domestic product, or roughly $145 billion. He said it must include tax incentives to induce businesses ''to make major investments in their enterprises this year,'' as well as provide ''direct and rapid income tax relief for the American people.''
 Mr. Bush said his purpose was ''to keep a fundamentally strong economy healthy.''
 ''In a vibrant economy, markets rise and decline,'' he said. ''We cannot change that fundamental dynamic. Yet there are also times when swift and temporary actions can help ensure that inevitable market adjustments do not undermine the health of the broader economy. This is such a moment.''
 Mr. Bush offered an important olive branch to Democrats. He did not insist that the package be linked to making his tax cuts permanent -- an idea that Democrats had warned would face stiff opposition -- but instead called on Congress to take up the issue of permanent tax cuts after passage of a rescue package.
 As he spoke, the members of his economic team were behind him, among them Vice President Dick Cheney, who was a prominent backer of the tax cuts Mr. Bush got through Congress in 2001 and 2003.
 Friday's announcement set Congress on a timetable much faster than the one Mr. Bush envisioned when, in an interview with reporters for Reuters two weeks ago, he volunteered that he was contemplating a stimulus package to provide a short-term push for the economy. 
 Mr. Bush pledged to make a decision about whether a package was necessary sometime around his State of the Union address on Jan. 28.
 But a combination of economic and political factors conspired to thrust the stimulus package to the top of the Washington agenda. The day after Mr. Bush's interview with Reuters, the government released a disappointing unemployment report. That, coupled with the slide in the stock market, created a sense that Congress needed to act quickly. 
 As Democrats began previewing their plans, the question of the stimulus package became a quiet undercurrent of Mr. Bush's extended trip through the Middle East. As Mr. Paulson reached out to lawmakers on Capitol Hill, Mr. Bush was receiving daily updates on economic data and reports being released back home, according to the White House counselor, Ed Gillespie. 
 The White House staff took part in a conference call on the options being considered by Mr. Paulson on the night Mr. Bush stayed on the farm of the Saudi leader, King Abdullah. The president convened a final staff meeting to talk about the package aboard Air Force One on Wednesday as he flew home from Egypt, and he agreed to talk to House and Senate leaders on Thursday.
 One Republican close to the White House said Mr. Bush's aides concluded that it was important for the president to get out ahead of any Democratic proposals. ''The president had to define the policy and political environment and lead the Congressional Republicans,'' this Republican said.
 Both parties see political opportunity in acting quickly. Mr. Bush's approval ratings may be low, but the ratings of Congress are even lower, and both sides believe that voters will look favorably on quick bipartisan action.
 ''There is a growing concern that the economy is deteriorating and Congress and the president must act quickly,'' said one senior Democratic aide, speaking on condition of anonymity. ''We're not able to afford that typical drawn-out and political legislative battle where both sides first stake out hard-line positions and come together after months of debate. We need to expedite the process by trying to take the politics out of it, which in turn is good politics.''
 Republicans appeared to be lining up behind Mr. Bush's plan -- and, in a rare turn of events, praising Democrats. ''We have started this year in a new way,'' the House Republican whip, Representative Roy Blunt of Missouri, said.
 But some economists questioned the wisdom of tax rebates as an effective stimulus tool. Brian M. Riedl, who analyzes the federal budget for the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research organization here, argued that rebates were essentially a redistribution of wealth and did not add anything to the economy, because the government must either levy taxes or borrow money to pay for them.
 ''Unfortunately, lawmakers are taking the political approach on the stimulus, which is to say they seem to be focusing on what proposals are popular than what will actually help the economy,'' Mr. Riedl said.
 At least one Republican, Representative Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, agreed. ''I think it's fine to send people their tax money back, but I don't think it does much to generate economic growth,'' he said, adding, ''This wouldn't be the first thing on my wish list.'' 
 But Mr. Ryan said he would vote for the plan anyway.

HEADLINE: In Nevada, Campaigns Face a Common Foe

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY and PATRICK HEALY

DATELINE: ELKO, Nev. 

 BODY:
On the eve of the Nevada caucuses, the third stop in the battle for the Democratic presidential nomination, the campaigns were doing more Friday than feverishly rallying their supporters. They were also fielding a question: What, exactly, is a caucus? 
 It would be nearly impossible not to notice that the road to the White House breezed into Nevada last week, what with television airwaves awash in advertisements, roadsides cluttered with political signs, and candidates suddenly on hand. 
 But while the state has had some previous experience with presidential caucuses (as well as primaries), never before has it voted so early in the nominating process. So where prior caucuses drew mainly party activists, the interest in the race this time promises to bring much wider participation, drawing people thoroughly unfamiliar with the process.
 ''I'm like, what the heck is caucusing?'' said Vickie Francovich, who intends to change her voter registration from independent to Democrat so she can take part in the caucuses on Saturday. ''Where do you go?''
 While their campaign organizations were answering questions like that, Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama traced similar patterns across the state Friday in appealing to voters. From rallies near the Las Vegas Strip to town meetings here in Elko, a desert city nestled atop the Ruby Mountains, the rivals exchanged particularly sharp criticism as the first contest in the West approached.
 (The Republican caucuses in Nevada have been overshadowed by the Democratic race. Mitt Romney was the only Republican to campaign in the state on Friday, his rivals choosing to remain in South Carolina, where the party's contenders clash in the first Southern primary on Saturday.)
 In Nevada's introductory role in the presidential limelight, telephone hot lines have been established across the state to answer voters' questions about their caucus locations. The Nevada Democratic Party could not find enough activists to run the 520 Democratic caucus sites, so out-of-state volunteers have arrived to help.
 Voters like Ms. Francovich, a 51-year-old construction company owner who saw Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton on Friday during separate rallies in Reno, said she had been motivated to participate because of the high degree of attention given the race. She had not been contacted by a campaign, though, and called a caucus telephone hot line on her own.
 Strategists conceded being utterly uncertain how many voters would attend the caucuses. A federal judge's ruling Thursday will allow on-site caucusing at nine casinos for employees on the Las Vegas Strip, adding to a circus element that has enveloped the race.
 After seeing a record number of Democratic voters take part in the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary, Nevada Democratic officials urgently ordered more materials to prevent a shortage. A heavy presence of organized labor, particularly members of the Culinary Workers Union and other service employees across the state, was fueling a remarkable intensity.
 ''All of the sudden, we have gotten everyone's attention,'' said Jill Derby, the Democratic state chairwoman. ''Nevada is no different than the rest of the country. There is a very high interest in change.''
 The candidates, too, were bringing a high level of intensity to the contest, erupting in ferocious exchanges, particularly between Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton. (Former Senator John Edwards held a morning rally in Las Vegas before setting off for Oklahoma and Missouri, two states among those offering a crush of primaries and caucuses on Feb. 5.)
 While a poll in The Las Vegas Review-Journal on Friday found that Mrs. Clinton held a lead, the nature of the contest here, unprecedented for Nevada, made polling more precarious than usual.
 Still, in his closing argument to voters, Mr. Obama spent an exceptional amount of time dwelling on Mrs. Clinton. He repeatedly mentioned her by name, reflecting a sense by some Democrats here -- and worry among his own advisers -- that she indeed held an advantage.
 ''Senator Clinton has said she is ready to lead from Day 1,'' Mr. Obama said at a rally at the University of Nevada, Reno. ''But it's important on Day 1 to get it right, whether you're talking about war or you're talking about economic proposals.''
 Mr. Obama questioned whether Mrs. Clinton was being straightforward with voters. He cited her economic stimulus plan, which he suggested she had copied from him by adding a tax rebate he had proposed.
 ''The American people don't want a president whose plans change with the politics of the moment,'' Mr. Obama said.
 For her part, Mrs. Clinton focused her criticism of Mr. Obama on comments he made to The Reno Gazette-Journal the other day about Ronald Reagan and the party Reagan built. Among other things, Mr. Obama was quoted as saying, ''It's fair to say that the Republicans were the party of ideas for a pretty long chunk of time there over the last 10 to 15 years.''
 Mrs. Clinton disputed that assertion during a stop in Elko, saying: ''Well, if you think privatizing Social Security is a good idea, I guess that's true. If you think huge tax cuts for the wealthy that explode the deficit are a good idea, then I guess you'd agree with that.''
 With a victory already recorded in one state by each leading candidate -- Mr. Obama in Iowa, Mrs. Clinton in New Hampshire -- the outcome in Nevada was seen not so much as critical to picking up delegates as it was a sign of momentum going into the South Carolina Democratic primary on Jan. 26 and the coast-to-coast fight that lies ahead on Feb. 5.
 As the candidates tussled before large audiences on Friday, a fierce battle was under way among labor unions in Las Vegas. One of them, the Culinary Workers Union Local 226, which has endorsed Mr. Obama, was running a Spanish-language radio advertisement highly critical of Mrs. Clinton, accusing her of abandoning Hispanic workers.
 Before leaving Elko, Mrs. Clinton called a brief news conference to say that her Nevada campaign office had received a phone call from a member of the culinary union who complained of being pressured to support Mr. Obama. ''I'm calling on all of the candidates and all of the unions,'' Mrs. Clinton said, ''to make it clear to their supporters and their members that the people in Nevada, a free and independent state with very independent people, are free to stand up for the candidate of their choice.''

HEADLINE: McCain and Huckabee Avoid Sparring in Final South Carolina Push

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER and MICHAEL POWELL; Michael Cooper reported from Charleston, and Michael Powell from Spartanburg, S.C. Michael Luo contributed reporting from Elko, Nev.

DATELINE: CHARLESTON, S.C. 

 BODY:
Senator John McCain capped his final full day of campaigning in South Carolina with a big rally in an aircraft carrier museum here on Friday evening, as Mike Huckabee delivered his populist economic message on the trail while highlighting his religious beliefs to draw out the evangelical vote in Saturday's primary here.
 As the campaign wound down here, its tone was in stark contrast to the lead-ups to the New Hampshire and Michigan primaries, and there was remarkably little direct sparring between Mr. McCain and Mr. Huckabee, the two leading candidates here, who seemed to be campaigning across the state on parallel paths, rather than engaging each other. 
 Mr. McCain campaigned along the Atlantic Coast, which has had big population increases in recent years, trying to appeal to veterans and military families by talking about improvements on the ground in the Iraq war, calling for better health care for veterans, and urging cuts in taxes and spending. Mr. Huckabee, meanwhile, worked the uplands, the state's religious conservative heartland, and spoke at every stop about the economic pain that many South Carolinians are experiencing. 
 ''A lot of Americans wonder, Does government understand what it's like to live paycheck to paycheck?'' Mr. Huckabee said at Wofford College, in Spartanburg, noting that the state had hit its highest unemployment rate in years. ''Do the people who live in the special bubble of the rarefied air of Washington, D.C., do they truly understand?''
 Mr. McCain, meanwhile, emphasized his national security experience in a rally aboard the aircraft carrier Yorktown, which is part of a naval museum here, just across the harbor from Charleston. He spoke on a stage beneath a World War II airplane.
 ''My friends, we are in challenging times,'' he said, summing up his pitch. ''I am running for president of the United States of America because I believe the transcendent challenge of the 21st century is the struggle against radical Islamic extremism, which takes many forms, is the greatest force of evil we've ever faced, and is bent on our destruction and our extinction. And my friends, we will never surrender. They will.''
 While they crisscrossed the state, Mitt Romney, who spent months and millions of dollars campaigning in South Carolina, spent the day on the other side of the country, campaigning in Nevada, which is holding its lightly contested Republican caucuses on Saturday, and then flying to Burbank, Calif., for a taping of ''The Tonight Show With Jay Leno'' on NBC. But Mr. Romney continued to advertise heavily on television across South Carolina.
 ''I figure it's the only way I can be in South Carolina and Nevada at the same time,'' he told reporters on Friday. ''Mike Huckabee did it before Iowa and he won, so maybe it'll do the same thing for me.''
 The campaign here in South Carolina is crucial for several candidates. Mr. McCain, who has predicted victory here, needs to win to show that he can replicate his showing in New Hampshire, and to get momentum to carry him into Florida for its Jan. 29 primary and to the more than 20 states with primaries on Feb. 5. 
 Mr. Huckabee needs to show that he can duplicate his success in the Iowa caucuses. And Fred D. Thompson, the actor and former Tennessee senator who has failed to win any contests, is staking his candidacy on a strong showing here, in the first Southern primary.
 But while there were a number of independent groups engaged in last-minute negative advertisements and phone calls, the campaigns largely refrained from attacking one another directly as they moved into the final stage of calling voters and mobilizing get-out-the-vote efforts for Saturday, despite forecasts of inclement weather.
 The sharp distinctions between the campaigns were evident in their final ads.
 The McCain campaign ran ads making fun of a proposal to spend federal money on a museum dedicated to Woodstock, highlighting his endorsement from The State, the largest newspaper in South Carolina, and speaking about his life of service to his country and the sacrifices of South Carolinians fighting overseas in a closing ad that featured Mr. McCain speaking directly to the camera, in front of an American flag.
 The Huckabee campaign, by contrast, worked to drill into the conservative heart of his base, running just one ad which proclaims him a ''Christian Leader'' exclusively since Wednesday. It begins, ''Faith doesn't just influence me; it defines me.''
 Bob Wickers, the Huckabee campaign's media consultant, said: ''Our message is all about his unwavering faith. Do we worry about turning off other folks? No. We want to energize that base.''
 Mr. McCain has cited his anti-abortion credentials more than usual here, both because it is a popular issue in the state and because anti-McCain phone calls have been made suggesting that he supports abortion rights. But for the most part he has promoted himself here as a fiscal conservative and a military hawk. 
 ''I'm confident, in South Carolina, we will get our share of social conservative voters because of their fear of radical Islamic extremism, because of their belief in our biblical obligation to stewardship of our planet, and three, their belief in our biblical obligation to maintain the integrity and security of the state of Israel,'' he said aboard his bus.
 The candidates also campaigned with different kinds of surrogates. Mr. McCain campaigned this week with Senator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma; Jack F. Kemp, the former congressman and vice-presidential nominee; Phil Gramm, the former Texas senator; and Cale Yarborough, the champion Nascar driver, who was born in South Carolina. Mr. Huckabee campaigned with Chuck Norris, the action star, and Ric Flair, the platinum-blond 16-time World Wrestling Entertainment champion. 
 One of the few direct engagements came from Mr. Thompson, who is competing with Mr. Huckabee for the votes of social conservatives. He criticized Mr. Huckabee for describing the Constitution as ''a living, breathing document.''
 ''Frankly, I assumed this came from Senator Clinton or Senator Obama,'' Mr. Thompson said in a statement. ''He does not appear to understand that reliance on the notion that the Constitution is a living, breathing document is precisely the kind of wrong-headed thinking about the Constitution that gave us Roe v. Wade, which legalized abortion across our nation, and Lawrence v. Texas, which decriminalized sodomy.''

 CORRECTION:
An article on Saturday about last-minute Republican campaigning before the South Carolina primary referred imprecisely to the schedule for Feb. 5. There will be more than 20 nominating contests for Republicans, including primaries and caucuses -- not more than 20 primaries.

HEADLINE: U.S. Sees Stalling by North Korea on Nuclear Pact

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
A debate is under way within the Bush administration over how long it can exercise patience with North Korea without jeopardizing the fulfillment of a nuclear agreement that President Bush has claimed as a foreign policy victory.
 With North Korea sending signals that it may be trying to wait out Mr. Bush's time in office before making any more concessions, administration officials are grappling with how the United States should react. 
 The debate has fractured along familiar lines, with a handful of national security hawks in Vice President Dick Cheney's office and at the State Department arguing for a more confrontational approach with Pyongyang. 
 On the other side, Mr. Bush's lead North Korea nuclear negotiator, Christopher R. Hill, has argued that the United States should continue a more restrained approach, one that is widely credited with bringing about an agreement last year that is intended eventually to lead to the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. 
 While the restrained stance still appears to have support from Mr. Bush and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, it is coming under fire from conservative critics, both in and out of the administration.
 In a public departure from administration policy, Jay Lefkowitz, a conservative lawyer who is Mr. Bush's envoy on North Korean human rights, said this week the North would likely ''remain in its present nuclear status'' when the next president took over in January 2009. 
 ''North Korea is not serious about disarming in a timely manner,'' Mr. Lefkowitz told an audience at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. ''We should consider a new approach to North Korea.''
 At issue is a declaration that North Korea was supposed to make by the end of last year formally stating everything in its nuclear inventory. When the North missed that deadline, administration officials initially sought to minimize the significance of the lapse, but they have expressed increasing concern in the wake of a North Korean statement on Jan. 4, in which the North insisted that it had already disclosed everything that it needed to.
 The North has cited a list of nuclear programs that it provided in November, but the United States has rejected the list as incomplete.
 ''Some people make the argument that we're just pursuing a policy of talks that go nowhere,'' said one administration official with knowledge of the debate within the administration.
 John R. Bolton, the former United States ambassador to the United Nations, argued in a Wall Street Journal op-ed article last week that the Bush administration should dump the nuclear pact with North Korea because, he said, Pyongyang was not interested in giving up its nuclear program. ''They're in the classic North Korean role of deception,'' Mr. Bolton said in an interview. ''It's like groundhog day; we've lived through this before.''
 Mr. Bush said the two countries needed to resolve three sticking points: the number of warheads that North Korea has built; the amount of weapons-grade nuclear material produced by North Korea; and the need for North Korea to disclose that it has passed nuclear material to others. 
 The proliferation issue has taken on new importance after an Israeli strike in Syria in September, which American and Israeli officials said was conducted against a nuclear facility near the Euphrates River that was supplied with material from North Korea. Administration officials want North Korea to disclose what help it may have given Syria, although they also say that the help came before the North agreed to dismantle its nuclear reactor and disclose its nuclear programs.
 Mr. Bolton and other critics of the agreement, including the officials in Mr. Cheney's office, never liked the pact to begin with, and advocates of the deal with North Korea say their second-guessing is expected.
 They argue that the Bush administration's previous confrontational strategy with North Korea is part of what led to the North's detonation of a nuclear device in October 2006.
 Besides the United States and North Korea, the other parties to the nuclear pact include China, South Korea, Japan and Russia.
 ''People lambaste the six-party process, and sure, it offers no refuge for those in need of instant gratification,'' Mr. Hill, the negotiator, said in an interview. ''But when asked for alternatives'' to the nuclear pact, Mr. Hill said, ''even the noisiest critics fall silent.'' 
 Administration officials say that the North has remained true to one part of the October agreement: It has made great strides in disabling and dismantling its nuclear reactor at Yongbyon. ''Bush can say, with credit, that he has achieved more than any other administration as far as dismantlement,'' said Gary Samore, a vice president at the Council on Foreign Relations who helped negotiate the Clinton administration's 1994 agreement with North Korea. ''He can say that he managed to freeze further production, and handed the next administration a diplomatic process.''
 But Bush administration officials say that they want more than just dismantlement on their record, and insist that they have not written off their chances of getting North Korea to make a complete declaration of its nuclear programs before the end of the administration. 
 Bush officials say they will not ultimately be able to verify that North Korea has got rid of its nuclear weapons program unless they first know what is in the program.
 ''The issue of the declaration is important because that which they declare must later be abandoned,'' a senior administration official said.
 The official, who asked that his name not be used because he was not authorized to speak publicly on the issue, said that the administration really wanted North Korea to provide an explanation for purchasing aluminum tubes that could be used to convert uranium gas into nuclear fuel. 
 In its Jan. 4 statement, North Korea accused the United States and the other countries in the six-party talks of reneging on promises made under an October deal, including the shipment of one million tons of fuel and the removal of North Korea from the United States' list of states that sponsored terrorism. 
 So far, North Korea has received about 150,000 tons of fuel, and Bush administration officials say the removal of the North from the terrorism list will depend on whether it meets the requirements of the October deal.
 North Korea agreed in October to dismantle its nuclear facilities and to disclose all of its past and present nuclear programs by the end of 2007 in return for 950,000 metric tons of fuel oil or its equivalent in economic aid. Last month, Mr. Bush reached out directly for the first time to the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, holding out the prospect of normalized relations with the United States if North Korea fully disclosed all nuclear programs and got rid of its nuclear weapons.

HEADLINE: G.E. Profit Up, Aided by Overseas Sales

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
The General Electric Company said Friday that its fourth-quarter profit rose 4 percent as surging overseas sales more than offset the fallout from domestic woes. The company also reaffirmed its forecast that earnings per share would rise at least 10 percent this year. 
 As Jeffrey R. Immelt, G.E.'s chief executive, rolled out the numbers during a morning conference call, it became increasingly clear that he had no surprises up his sleeve. But for many analysts, the lack of surprise was a sharp relief. 
 ''Given all the angst about the economy, this was a very, very reassuring quarter and confirmation of '08 outlook,'' said Deane M. Dray, an analyst with Goldman Sachs who rates G.E. a buy. 
 Paul R. Davis, chief investment officer of Marble Harbor Investment Counsel, said he might add to his firm's ''significant position'' in G.E. shares. ''We like the way Jeff Immelt is playing the hand he was dealt,'' he said. 
 Much has indeed changed since Dec. 11, when Mr. Immelt told analysts what to expect from G.E. in 2008. The company's NBC Universal unit is facing a protracted writers' strike that threatens to hobble entertainment companies. Also, G.E. derives about 34 percent of its revenue from consumer finance, so it is not immune to the consumer delinquencies that have plagued other companies. And many economists warn of a recession, which could hurt every G.E. business.
 ''When we saw delinquency rates rise at other financial services companies, we feared severe deterioration in G.E.'s financial segments, too,'' said Richard Tortoriello, an analyst at Standard & Poor's who rates G.E. a buy. ''Instead, they've done a good job controlling risk.''
 Skittish investors, who punished G.E. shares over the last few months, showed palpable relief on Friday, lifting the stock 3.31 percent, or $1.10, to $34.31.
 G.E. said that fourth-quarter net income was $6.8 billion, or 66 cents a share, compared with $6.44 billion, or 62 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. When discontinued operations like plastics, mortgages and GE Money's operations in Japan are factored out, income from continuing operations was up 15 percent and earnings per share were up 17 percent, in line with analysts' expectations. Revenue rose 18 percent, to $48.6 billion.
 For the full year, earnings from continuing operations rose 16 percent, to $22.5 billion, on revenue that rose 14 percent, to $172.74 billion. More than 9 percent of the revenue growth was organic, meaning it came from businesses G.E. had owned at least a year. 
 GE Infrastructure, which sells aircraft engines, power generators and other heavy equipment, continued to be the star performer. It sells heavily in developing countries that are building their highways and industries and airline fleets. By the time that overseas demand slows, G.E. expects domestic customers to be buying again. 
 ''The U.S. carriers aren't buying planes today, which means they will have to replace their aging fleets at about the time that global demand levels off,'' Keith S. Sherin, G.E.'s chief financial officer, said in an interview. The same will be true in power generators, he said. He noted that 164 of the 170 gas turbines that G.E. sold last year were outside the United States but that American utilities will have to eventually build more capacity, too. 
 There are some possible trouble spots, of course. G.E. owns 80 percent of NBC Universal, which derived solid revenue from films, from cable operations that focus on news or on syndicated reruns, and from reality TV shows. Yet, the writers' strike could eventually hamper the network television business. 
 The health care division is still grappling with a consent decree on manufacturing requirements that has kept it from shipping some surgical X-ray equipment, and with declining orders for diagnostic equipment from clinics because insurers have lowered reimbursement rates. 
 G.E. also has had to increase reserves aimed at any residual problems from subprime mortgage loans. And G.E.'s appliance business is suffering from the slowdown in housing. 
 But analysts seem unfazed. ''G.E. has grown earnings a little bit in past economic slowdowns,'' Mr. Tortoriello said. ''They probably can do it now, too.''

HEADLINE: Romney Offers an Economic Stimulus Plan

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
Mitt Romney offered an ambitious plan Friday to try to forestall a recession, proposing a $250 billion economic stimulus package with sweeteners for supply-side conservatives, older Americans and corporations. 
 Mr. Romney's proposal, outlined in a telephone interview during a campaign swing through Nevada, is grounded in new, permanent income tax reductions. It is also double the size of stimulus packages offered by two of the Democratic presidential candidates, Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama, and far exceeds the $145 billion plan that President Bush suggested to Congress on Friday. 
 Specifically, Mr. Romney proposed:
 A cut in the top corporate rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, phased in over two years.
 Cutting the lowest individual income tax bracket to 7.5 percent from 10 percent. To provide immediate spending money for those with moderate incomes, he would make that reduction retroactively applicable to 2007 income for taxpayers earning less than $97,500.
 Permanently eliminating Social Security payroll taxes for workers over age 65.
 Temporarily permitting businesses to deduct 100 percent of the cost of investments for two years beginning Jan. 1, 2008.
 Eliminating capital gains and dividend taxes for taxpayers earning under $200,000 a year.
 The proposal comes as Mr. Romney, a former executive at Bain Capital, has turned increasingly to economic issues as a way to revive his prospects for the Republican nomination. He is already facing competition from Mike Huckabee for socially conservative voters.
 Mr. Romney used the proposal to distinguish himself from his rival Senator John McCain, who declared in a recent debate that his short-term approach to an economic slowdown was to cut spending.
 ''That is not stimulative,'' Mr. Romney said of the McCain approach.
 On the potential impact on the long-term budget deficit, he said, ''If we go into recession, the cost to our balanced budget is going to be far more severe than the cost of this program.''
 To appeal to economic conservatives, Mr. Romney cited the permanent nature of his tax cuts, which he called on Congress to enact within 30 days.
 ''The kinds of stimulative actions we take should be pro-growth,'' he said. ''They aren't just writing checks for people to buy oil or TVs.''

HEADLINE: With Sprint's Client Erosion, Fears of Wireless Slowdown

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
Sprint Nextel's announcement on Friday that it is losing customers more rapidly than expected is making investors nervous about a weak economy's effect on other wireless companies.
 Shares of Sprint fell $2.87, or 25 percent, to $8.70 after it said that it planned to lay off 4,000 workers and close stores to trim costs as its customer base shrinks.
 The stock prices of AT&T and Verizon also slipped after the news. AT&T, the largest wireless carrier, was down more than 3 percent, and Verizon, which owns Verizon Wireless along with Vodafone, fell more than 4 percent. 
 Sprint has been struggling for more than a year, and installed a new chief executive only last month. But the sharp drop in the company's customer count during the traditionally strong holiday quarter, analysts say, raises concerns that the problem extends beyond Sprint.
 ''The broader question here is whether this is the tip of the iceberg in a deceleration of the U.S. wireless market over all,'' said Craig Moffett, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company.
 Industry analysts had estimated that in the fourth quarter Sprint lost about 350,000 contract subscribers -- a carrier's most valuable customers, signed up for contracts of a year or more. Instead, Sprint announced that it had a net loss of 638,000 contract customers.
 ''It's the magnitude of the weakness that is shocking,'' said Michael Nelson, an analyst at the Stanford Group, an investment firm.
 To reduce costs, Sprint said it planned to cut its payroll by 4,000 workers. The company, based in Reston, Va., currently has about 60,000 employees. 
 Sprintsaid it would also close 125 company-owned retail stores, about 8 percent of the nearly 1,400 in the Sprint chain. The total labor savings, the company said, should be $700 million to $800 million a year.
 The cutbacks were the first major step taken by Sprint since the arrival last month of its new chief executive, Daniel R. Hesse. He had been the chief executive of Embarq Corporation, a local-phone spinoff of Sprint.
 Cutting costs at Sprint, analysts say, is a logical step, given the decline in business. But they say the company must address other fundamental issues -- some unresolved since Sprint completed its $35 billion purchase of Nextel in 2005. The company, the analysts say, runs two networks that use different technologies, and making the transition to a single compatible technology is proving to be more time-consuming and costly than expected.
 Sprint, Mr. Nelson said, has also not settled on a consistent marketing strategy. By contrast, he said, Verizon has successfully promoted the quality of its network with advertisements that include the catchphrase ''Can you hear me now?'' 
 And AT&T has carved out a position as offering a reliable network and stylish handsets. It was the first to offer Motorola's Razr and, later, Apple's iPhone.
 ''But Sprint has not come up with a broad enough marketing strategy to appeal to a mass consumer audience yet,'' Mr. Nelson said.
 It is unclear whether Sprint's travails are solely its own or portend broader troubles for cellphone carriers. Before the Sprint announcement, Mr. Moffett of Bernstein published a report that noted the telecommunications industry has long been considered a safe haven when the economy is weak. ''Suddenly,'' he wrote, ''that looks like a riskier bet.''
 The reason, he said, is doubt about the outlook for the wireless business. The industry has been adding 3 million to 5 million new subscribers a quarter in recent years. But by now, more than 85 percent of Americans are subscribers -- well into the 90s, if one includes only adults.
 The growth in net new subscribers will inevitably slow. Some of the slippage will be offset by increased revenue per user, as subscribers buy more data services like Web searching, video and audio. But the main engine of growth for the industry, Mr. Moffett said, has been new subscribers.
 In the last national economic slowdown, the pace of new-subscriber signups fell approximately in half from 2000 to 2002, before rebounding again.
 ''If we're headed into a recession,'' Mr. Moffett said, ''wireless growth expectations are suspect.''

HEADLINE: Romney Alters His Message, but Questions Remain

BYLINE: By MICHAEL LUO

DATELINE: RENO, Nev. 

 BODY:
Mitt Romney's advisers contend he has found his voice with his retooled message focused on changing Washington and confronting the economic jitters gripping the country.
 The revamped pitch has certainly allowed him to re-emphasize aspects of his candidacy that many thought could get him the Republican presidential nomination in the first place: his business background and his image as a corporate turnaround artist. Mr. Romney can also legitimately claim he is an outsider to Washington, given that he spent much of his life in the private sector.
 But as has often been the case with Mr. Romney, parts of his change mantra have rung inauthentic to some, engendering fresh accusations of pandering and political misspeak from critics and rivals. 
 ''There's something about Mitt Romney that makes people disinclined to cut him a lot of slack,'' said Dan Schnur, a Republican strategist who is not affiliated with any campaign. ''Every candidate for every office pushes the envelope in their message. You don't win a lot of elections with subtlety, but Romney seems to get called on it more frequently.'' 
 In South Carolina this week, Mr. Romney trotted out his private-sector background -- he began his career in consulting and then earned millions of dollars as a founder of the leveraged buyout firm Bain Capital -- as evidence of his economic expertise and commitment to job creation. He did not mention that in some cases his company caused layoffs.
 That happened in the case of Ampad, a paper product company that Bain Capital invested in. Its management later dismissed 200 workers. Disgruntled employees campaigned against Mr. Romney in 1994 when he ran unsuccessfully for a Senate seat in Massachusetts.
 In speaking at a retirement community in Bluffton, S.C., Mr. Romney said, ''We fought every time to grow employment. I will do that in this country.''
 When a reporter asked him if he was worried about making unrealistic promises to ailing industries, Mr. Romney said his posture should be to ''fight for every job.'' He conceded, however, that some jobs would inevitably be lost ''from time to time.'' 
 The harsh economic reality is something Mr. Romney is deeply familiar with. ''To be successful in business, you do want to create jobs because that usually makes money,'' said Eric Kriss, who helped Mr. Romney found Bain Capital and later worked with him in the Massachusetts statehouse but is uncommitted in the presidential race. ''The nuance in a turnaround is that sometimes jobs are first eliminated during a restructuring, often a necessary step before new jobs and growth can be created.''
 Mr. Romney's campaign argues that it is his experience in the private sector and in running the 2002 Winter Olympics and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts that gives credence to his message.
 ''Here's somebody who has a life experience that was built on close to 25 years in business before he entered a public career,'' said Kevin Madden, a campaign spokesman. ''You have a resume of accomplishment with every challenge he's ever encountered.''
 With his economic focus, Mr. Romney's record in Massachusetts is beginning to draw new scrutiny. Experts have pointed out that while the state's economic and fiscal condition improved under Mr. Romney, its job growth trailed the rest of the nation.
 On the larger message of change, questions seemed to crystallize on Thursday in an exchange between Mr. Romney and Glen Johnson, an Associated Press reporter. Mr. Johnson challenged an argument Mr. Romney had used repeatedly as part of his new stump speech, insisting that, unlike many of his rivals, he did not have favors to repay to the K Street lobbyist crowd in Washington.
 ''I don't have lobbyists running my campaign,'' Mr. Romney said at a news conference in Columbia, S.C., an apparent reference to Mr. McCain, whose campaign manager, Rick Davis, was a lobbyist. 
 Mr. Romney was on the verge of extending his argument when Mr. Johnson shouted out: ''That's not true, governor. That is not true.'' He cited Ronald C. Kaufman, an unpaid senior adviser to the campaign and a Washington lobbyist. 
 Mr. Romney argued that Mr. Kaufman did not even sit in on ''senior strategy meetings,'' even though Mr. Kaufman, a close friend, is a regular at the campaign's Boston headquarters and has been a regular presence at Mr. Romney's side over the past few weeks.
 Other registered lobbyists who have played a significant role in his campaign include Warren Tompkins, Mr. Romney's South Carolina consultant; Barbara Comstock, a senior adviser; and Vin Weber, Mr. Romney's policy chairman.
 Mr. Romney also received almost $200,000 in donations from federally registered lobbyists through the third quarter of last year, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, second among Republican candidates to Mr. McCain, who took in just over $300,000.
 The ultimate question is whether Mr. Romney is a credible voice for change. ''There's no question that he comes from outside Washington and brings that sort of outsider's perspective,'' Mr. Schnur said. ''But there may be a residual suspicion that even though he hasn't lived in Washington, D.C., he's essentially been part of a business and political establishment throughout his career.''

HEADLINE: Relying on Tax-Based Tonics Used in 2001, As economists Debate What's the Quickest Cure

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN and EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
In trying to assemble a bipartisan package to jolt the slumping economy, the White House and Congress have turned to familiar tools that experts say have worked in the past. But there is also a lively debate among economists about which measures will best accomplish the goal.
 The favorite template for addressing recession fears is a set of tax measures and spending initiatives passed in 2001 and 2002, including a personal income tax rebate in the summer of 2001 that amounted to $300 to $600 per household and a tax incentive the following year aimed at encouraging businesses to invest in new plants and equipment.
 President Bush highlighted both those basic approaches on Friday in setting out his principles for a deal with Congress to address the current downturn. Democrats are also likely to seek increased spending for programs like unemployment insurance or to funnel more money to states, an approach that Mr. Bush signaled he would oppose.
 ''The research I've seen indicates that the programs in 2001 clearly worked,'' Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. said in an interview, referring to the tax measures. ''They worked quickly, and people spent the money they got. The thing we should be looking at now is how to make them even more effective.'' 
 The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office reported this week that each of the three elements of the 2001-2 stimulus -- personal tax rebates, incentives for business investment and government spending programs -- played a role in lifting the economy.
 Mr. Paulson said he and his colleagues first began examining the 2001 experience before Christmas, drawing lessons for a contingency proposal if the economy continued to decelerate. The formulation of the principles put forward by Mr. Bush on Friday began two weeks ago.
 Personal tax rebates are intended to put cash in the hands of consumers, in the hope that they will spend it immediately, giving a lift to stores, service providers and manufacturers of consumer goods, rather than saving it or using it to pay down debt. 
 Incentives for business investment are intended to prompt companies to accelerate plans to buy new equipment, increasing demand for that type of product and helping to forestall employment losses or spur new hiring.
 ''We looked at a lot of data and got a lot of anecdotal evidence,'' Mr. Paulson said. ''The discussions I had with Congress made us feel better about these measures. People on the Hill saw a need, and they are willing to put aside their pet projects and major strategic priorities to get it passed.''
 All indications are that the likely package to be voted on will be a hodgepodge, but experts say that is not bad. Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, testified Thursday before the House Budget Committee that because there was disagreement among specialists on what worked, it might be best to adopt a mixture.
 ''A program that combined a number of elements might in some sense address the problem from a number of different angles and be more effective than one that was only a single element,'' he said. 
 Stimulus packages of the less recent past are often cited as examples of how not to make policy. Economists say that in the recession of the mid-1970s, spending and tax cut measures were enacted too slowly, having an effect only after the economy had already picked up. In 1992 and 1993, partisan squabbling derailed plans for a stimulus package as the recession came and went.
 The measures seven years ago sent a different lesson, according to John B. Taylor, a professor of economics at Stanford and a former Treasury official under Mr. Bush. ''People look back at 2001 and are more positive about this kind of approach,'' he added.
 There continues to be a debate among economists about how best to give a kick to the economy. The Congressional Budget Office, for example, said that temporary one-time-only changes in tax policy may have only a moderate effect relative to permanent changes like lower income tax rates. 
 Consumption jumped after the tax rebate in 2001, it said, but researchers cannot be sure that was because of the tax rebate or the passage of the long-term tax cuts at the same time.
 Joel Slemrod, professor of business economics at the University of Michigan, said his study of the 2001 tax rebates showed only 22 percent of taxpayers he surveyed spent most of their rebates. The data suggests that the effect of such rebates, he said, ''wouldn't be as big as one might hope.''
 Many economists say that a drawback to Mr. Bush's proposals, as outlined so far, is that they might not put cash in the hands of people most likely to spend it: those at the lower end of the income spectrum. Mr. Bush signaled that he would limit rebates to people who pay federal income taxes, and many low- and middle-income people pay little or no federal income tax, because they benefit from various deductions and credits. 
 Robert Greenstein, executive director of the Center on Budget Policy and Priorities, is one of many liberal economists urging that the tax rebate be in the form of a credit for children, or some form of credit for Social Security taxes workers pay.
 Without such improvements, he said, Mr. Bush's plan ''would save fewer jobs and do less to shore up a weak economy than it should.'' He asserted that the business tax incentives of 2001 and 2002 also had only a modest effect on the economy. 
 Matthew Shapiro, another economist at the University of Michigan, reached a similar conclusion about the proposed incentives for business -- namely accelerated depreciation or what is called a bonus depreciation on capital spending. These are aimed at encouraging investment by allowing businesses to write off the costs faster.
 But Mr. Shapiro estimated that the tax incentives for business investment in the past did not work broadly throughout the business sector. He said the ''vast majority of investment did not benefit much'' from such a measure.
 Mr. Paulson, in the interview, acknowledged that if businesses were losing money, a tax incentive for investment would not work as well. But he said that in the current economy, ''businesses are operating at fuller levels so this program would be more effective than in the past.'' After the last downturn in 2001, business investment slumped for several years after Congress passed tax incentives , in part because many companies had vast amounts of extra production capacity.
 Although Democrats have begun to embrace the idea of tax relief for families and businesses, they also insist that the government should provide aid to states to forestall budget cutbacks, extend unemployment benefits and possibly channel money to individuals through programs like food stamps.
 Republicans are reluctant to embark on that kind of spending, in part because they do not want federal funds to pay for state government programs over which Washington has no control. But all sides agree that if speed is of the essence, so is the likelihood of compromise.
 Economists say that one lesson from past efforts is that there is no point in doing something too late. This time, however, a consensus is emerging that Congress can pass something as early as March and that money can get into the hands of consumers, businesses and states shortly thereafter.

At the time, the University of Michigan conducted a survey asking people what they intended to do with the payments and found only about 22 percent planned to spend them.

HEADLINE: Help for Afghanistan

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Ambassador Ronald E. Neumann correctly characterizes the increasingly volatile conditions in Afghanistan by noting the presence of a ''growing Taliban resurgence'' (''Afghans, Report for Duty,'' Op-Ed, Jan. 14). Recent Senlis Council research indicates that a resurgent Taliban now has a permanent presence in 54 percent of the country. 
 Although Ambassador Neumann cites the need for a stronger Afghan military to counter the growing Taliban insurgency, increased military efforts must also be coupled with effective administration of aid by ensuring that funds arrive where they are most needed.
 Currently, the Afghan population is facing widespread starvation and a growing refugee crisis. A failure to address these problems sends a message to Afghan civilians that Western forces are not there to help them. This only serves to drive them into the arms of the Taliban, who have used cunning propaganda to rapidly recruit many disillusioned civilians.
 The forced eradication of poppy crops has further worsened the situation by threatening the livelihoods of impoverished Afghan farmers. Senlis Council has proposed an alternative plan that was recently backed by the European Parliament.
 By allowing Afghan farmers to cultivate poppy for morphine, the economy of Afghanistan's rural communities could be diversified, which could win back the hearts and minds of the Afghan people.
 Eradication will and can never be successful because it destroys the one crop that serves as the main income to millions of Afghans. An Ipsos Reid survey commissioned by us in the United States revealed that the majority of the American public opposes it. Furthermore, 66 percent of those polled backed our Poppy for Medicine initiative.
 More pragmatic counternarcotics policies, along with effective aid administration, could significantly shorten the current conflict in Afghanistan.

HEADLINE: Pakistan, Terrorism and Drugs

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Militants Escape Control of Pakistan, Officials Say'' (front page, Jan. 15):
 Suicide bombing is a phenomenon imported from Iraq and Afghanistan, alien to Pakistan. The strategy to support the Afghans against Soviet military intervention was evolved by several intelligence agencies, including the C.I.A. and Inter-Services Intelligence, or ISI. 
 After the Soviet withdrawal, the Western powers walked away from the region, leaving behind 40,000 militants imported from several countries to wage the anti-Soviet jihad. Pakistan was left to face the blowback of extremism, drugs and guns. 
 The post-9/11 intervention in Afghanistan led to a further inflow of extremists and terrorists from Afghanistan. As Pakistan's national security objectives have changed, so have the policies and personnel of ISI. Since 9/11, the Pakistani Army, including the ISI, have been in a front-line role in the fight against terrorism, capturing more than 700 Qaeda operatives, including most of its top leaders.
 The ISI has played a pivotal role in aborting several terrorists' plots against Western countries. It works closely with the agencies of allied countries. 
 Like the United States and NATO forces in Afghanistan, Pakistan also faces challenges in fighting the terrorists in a difficult terrain. Tactics often evolve through trial and error. Anti-insurgent capacity has to be built up. Yet, given our role and sacrifices, Pakistan's commitment to combat terrorism cannot be questioned. 
 Munir Akram Ambassador and Permanent Representative Pakistan Mission to the U.N. New York, Jan. 17, 2008
 To the Editor:
 ''Militants Escape Control of Pakistan, Officials Say'' doesn't cite perhaps the prime factor assisting the rebels, including Al Qaeda and the Taliban: the opium and heroin produced and transited in that nation and neighboring Afghanistan. 
 Pakistan is fast evolving into the same drug-financed chaos, financing Al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden, which Afghanistan has already become. Afghanistan supplies 92 percent of the world's heroin-producing opium, and Pakistan now transports a growing 36 percent of Afghanistan's illicit opium, according to a State Department report last year.
 Afghanistan and Pakistan are the No. 1 export and transit nations in the world for opium used for heroin. Opium production, on our watch, has increased 33-fold from 185 tons in 2001 to more than 6,000 tons in 2006. 
 As Senator Charles E. Schumer reported during passage of an amendment in 2006 to strengthen counternarcotics assistance to Afghanistan, stripped by the administration and Republicans in conference, ''The Taliban generates roughly 70 percent of its income through the production and sale of opium.'' 
 It appears that the United States military presence, afraid to disrupt supposedly friendly Afghanistan and Pakistan's economies, has maintained a blind eye rather than eradicate the drug trade. 
 Far from blocking drug trafficking, the government of Pakistan's negotiated truce with rebels in northwestern Pakistan, with ties to the Taliban and Al Qaeda, has provided carte blanche to grow, transport and get big money from the illicit crops.
 In both Afghanistan and Pakistan, our military should be helping theirs to fight drugs. There must be bolder surveillance and eradication of poppy fields, stronger enforcement of cross-border anti-smuggling measures, and bank financing freezes of traffickers' finances.

HEADLINE: Burned but Bullish at Citigroup

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
IF any Wall Street seer should be bearish right now, it's Tobias Levkovich, the chief United States equity strategist at Citigroup.
 After all, last week his employer announced a whopping $10 billion loss, not to mention a 41 percent dividend cut and 4,000 additional job cuts. Shares of Citigroup and other financial giants are down sharply in recent months, a fact hardly lost on Mr. Levkovich, who has worked for the bank and its predecessor companies for 20 years.
 ''The hit my portfolio has taken has become a significant loss by anyone's measure,'' he says. ''I feel crummy.'' 
 Nevertheless, from his perch at the beleaguered global financial giant, Mr. Levkovich has the distinction of being among the most prominent bulls on Wall Street. His forecast calls for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index to reach 1,675 by the end of 2008, 350 points and 26 percent higher than where it closed Friday.
 With the S.& P. 500 dropping 5.4 percent last week alone, he acknowledges that his target ''is clearly a number that is under duress; the idea that the market will be up 300 points from its current level is something I'm pretty sure people will scoff at.''
 But, he says, ''I'm sticking with it for now because I don't have an analytical basis for changing that view.''
 Crunching the numbers from past downturns while analyzing current earnings projections, Mr. Levkovich argues that the market has already priced in a 40 percent drop in earnings. That is far steeper than even the 20 percent profit drop that typically occurs in a recession.
 And while the odds of a recession are increasing, he says, it's not a sure thing. ''If you had talked to us three months ago, we would have said there is a 25 to 30 percent chance of a recession,'' he says. Today he rates that chance at about 50 percent, so to him there's more than a sliver of hope that the pessimists are wrong.
 The actual math gets pretty complicated but boils down to this, Mr. Levkovich says: ''If you track long-term patterns of earnings multiples versus bond yields and equity-risk premiums, we're at a level today that's only occurred in 87 months out of the last 46 years. In every single instance the market was up 12 months later, with an average gain of 23 percent.''
 Still with him? I thought so.
 Other parts of his bullish case are a bit more understandable for nonquantitative types, however. For example, he suggests that the huge mortgage-related write-offs by Citigroup, as well as other financial giants like Merrill Lynch and JPMorgan Chase, most likely peaked last quarter, unless the economy enters a very deep dive.
 As for the gloomy sentiment afflicting many investors, Mr. Levkovich argues that it is actually what Wall Streeters call a contra-indicator.
 ''Investors have a tendency to chase performance,'' he notes. ''People put the most money into the market when it was peaking in 2000. Conversely, they tended to bail out in 2002, just as the market was preparing to rebound. So negative sentiment is actually a bullish sign.''
 Not convinced by Mr. Levkovich's make-lemons-into-lemonade argument? You're not alone. Richard Bernstein, chief investment strategist at Merrill Lynch, praises Mr. Levkovich as an insightful market watcher but says: ''There's one major issue upon which we currently disagree. People have underestimated the scope and the spread of the credit problems in the global economy.''
 FIVE and a half years ago, when the S.& P. 500 was off 49 percent from its dot-com-era peak and individual and institutional investors alike were staggered by the collapse of once-hot giants like WorldCom and Enron, he says it would have been hard to imagine that the next three years would have average annual gains of 12.8 percent.
 ''If you told people in the fall of 2002 that the S.& P. would be above its 2000 high within five years, you would have been laughed out of the room,'' he says. ''People said this was going to take decades to recover from.''
 Nowadays, he says, that deep pessimism dominates the debt market and is spreading. But Mr. Levkovich is unbowed by that, too, even though he acknowledges that the last few months have taken their toll.
 ''I'm 46, but I feel like I'm 90,'' he half-jokes. ''I've aged a lot recently.''

HEADLINE: Little Cambodia, Growing Still Littler

BYLINE: By DAVID SHAFTEL

 BODY:
VIBOL SOK SUNGKRIEM, a 31-year-old aspiring filmmaker, had invited a few friends over for dinner, and his apartment just east of the New York Botanical Garden was flooded with camaraderie and the aroma of spicy Southeast Asian food.
 Like Mr. Sungkriem, who wears a whisper of a mustache and favors baggy clothes, most of the half-dozen guests were Cambodians who came to New York as refugees in the 1980s. 
 Over katiev, a spicy Cambodian noodle soup made with beef, shrimp and fish balls, they told stories about escaping from Khmer Rouge soldiers in Cambodia as they fled to refugee camps in Thailand. They talked about running from thugs on Fordham Road when they were younger, when violence was a fact of everyday life in many Bronx neighborhoods. 
 As they ate, Mr. Sungkriem opened his laptop and switched on its video instant messaging so that two absent friends could join the party. Within the past few years, both had moved from New York to Cambodian communities elsewhere in the country; one, a police officer, to Los Angeles, for a better job, the other to Stockton, Calif., after a particularly harrowing mugging.
 Those two departures tell a broader tale. Not long ago, Mr. Sungkriem and his friends held such parties frequently. But since the mid-'90s, a growing number of Cambodians have left the city, and the parties are held less often.
 Data from the 2000 census shows that the city's Cambodian population decreased by 31 percent from 1990 to 2000. According to a census analysis by the Hmong Studies Internet Resource Center, the decline occurred as nearly all the country's other Cambodian communities were expanding. 
 At the high-water mark of 1990, census figures show, 2,565 Cambodians lived in the city, primarily in the Fordham, University Heights and Bronx Park East sections of the Bronx. Most were refugees who were resettled in New York after fleeing the repressive Khmer Rouge regime, which fell in 1979 and claimed nearly two million lives. According to an analysis of 2005 numbers prepared by the Census Bureau, barely 1,000 Cambodians then remained in the city. 
 ''Everybody is leaving,'' Mr. Sungkriem said recently at an IHOP restaurant near his apartment. ''It used to be if you walk down Fordham Road, you would bump into lots of Cambodians walking or shopping. Now you can be driving up and down all day, and you never see any.''
 Trials are finally expected to start sometime this year for five major Khmer Rouge figures who were detained and will face a special tribunal backed by the United Nations, but many of New York's dwindling number of Cambodians are focusing on more immediate problems.
 ''In the '80s, people didn't understand what Cambodians were,'' Mr. Sungkriem said. ''They just called us Chinos. But if you said you were a gangster, you were a star. A lot of people have grown out of that, though, and there are no jobs, no community services. So a lot of people left.''
 Among those eager to leave is Paul Keo, 36, who moved to the Bronx when he was 11 and grew up with Mr. Sungkriem. 
 Mr. Keo, who recently married, works as a technical administrator for Pratt Institute, and the other day, dressed in corduroy pants, fleece jacket and running shoes, he could easily have been mistaken for a Pratt student, save for the ring of keys on his belt.
 Although he enjoys his work, he is increasingly weighing the options. ''The community here is broken,'' he said in an empty Pratt classroom. ''I really don't want my children to grow up in the same difficult environment I did.''
 FOR many Cambodians who came to the city in the '80s, the high school years were tainted by crime and violence, and poor schools left them prepared only for the manufacturing jobs that had already begun leaving the city. Mr. Keo said his solution was to ''steal'' his education. ''After high school,'' he said, ''I would go to colleges and sit in on classes and observe the material without registering.'' 
 The problems of Cambodians in New York were compounded because the community, small to begin with, became established during a decade when the city struggled on many fronts.
 ''The violence they experienced during the Khmer Rouge was similar to the violence they saw every day in the Bronx,'' said Chhaya Chhoum, director of the Youth Leadership Project at CAAAV, formerly the Committee Against Anti-Asian Violence. ''So they were never able to move away from their trauma.'' The group occupies a former convent on Valentine Avenue near Fordham Road that it plans to make a Southeast Asian cultural center. 
 In the turbulent Bronx, few of the Cambodian cultural, religious and community centers that have formed in places like Long Beach, Calif., Lowell, Mass., and Minneapolis took root. 
 Groups like the Vietnamese fared better. Although many of them came to the Bronx roughly around the same time as the Cambodians, they arrived in larger numbers. And unlike the Cambodians, a culturally isolated people, the Vietnamese forged bonds with the city's large Chinese population, with whom they share cultural ties.
 One result of the exodus of the city's Cambodians is a widening generation gap. Cambodians who remain in New York tend to be older and in failing health; those who leave are typically younger emigres who attended school in the United States and have the ability or the resources to find jobs elsewhere, often in hotels or garment factories.
 One emigre, Siek Chanty, 51, who is unemployed and spends time at the center, said she wanted to leave the Bronx but had nowhere to go. 
 Many who were separated from their families during the war have located relatives in places like California or Texas. But, Ms. Chanty said through an interpreter, ''I haven't found anyone.''

HEADLINE: A Recession's Impact Is All in the Timing

BYLINE: By PAUL J. LIM. 
Paul J. Lim is a senior editor at Money magazine. E-mail: fund@nytimes.com

 BODY:
A FEW weeks ago, the big debate on Wall Street was whether or not the economy was headed for a recession. Today, for many investors, the question isn't whether a recession is coming, but when. In fact, some are wondering whether one has already begun.
 Does the timing of a recession really matter? If you're an equity investor, it does. 
 No matter how aggressively the Federal Reserve lowers interest rates, the economy may be headed for a severe downturn. The stock market, at least, seems to support this argument. Just three weeks into the new year, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is down nearly 10 percent. And since the market peaked Oct. 9, stocks have lost more than 15 percent of their value.
 So, the thinking goes, the sooner an official recession is declared, the sooner the economy can start to work its way out of it. ''If we are in fact in recession, we may be close to fleshing out a bottom here in stock prices,'' said Duncan W. Richardson, chief equity investment officer at Eaton Vance, the asset management firm in Boston.
 Moreover, recent history shows that it's often the anticipation of a recession that depresses stock prices, not the actual experience of a recession. So if we're out of the anticipatory stage, stocks could soon start to stabilize.
 Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at S.& P., studied the performance of the stock market during the last 11 recessions, as defined by the National Bureau of Economic Research, going back to 1945. He found that the S.& P. 500 fell 26 percent, on average, from the months leading up to a recession to the recession lows.
 Yet Mr. Stovall's analysis also showed that between the official starting and ending dates of those recessions, the S.& P. held relatively steady, gaining 0.1 percent, on average. 
 To be sure, this wasn't always the case. In the most recent recession, from March to November 2001, stocks tumbled by around 8 percent. And in the severe recession that ran from November 1973 to March 1975, the S.& P. lost nearly a quarter of its value.
 Moreover, the early stages of recessions generally aren't smooth sailing. A separate study of stocks and recessions by Ned Davis Research showed that equity prices tend to drop nearly 5 percent in the first six months of contractions. 
 But the typical recession since World War II has lasted 10 months, on average, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research. And over those entire periods, stocks have historically held their ground.
 Why is this important? Well, some economists think that the economy is already in a recession. Earlier this month, the Merrill Lynch economist David A. Rosenberg said that recent employment data suggested the economy might have slipped into a recession at the end of last year. If it did, that could turn out to be reasonably good news for the equity markets now.
 Keep in mind that in three of the last four recessions, stocks didn't simply hold steady -- they actually gained ground. In the recession from July 1990 to March 1991, for instance, the S.& P. 500 rose 2.5 percent, despite a severe sell-off in the summer of 1990. And in the recession from January to July of 1980, stocks climbed nearly 6 percent.
 There is something else to consider. If the economy is already in recession, the Fed will probably have more impetus to cut short-term interest rates to fuel economic activity. And as Nick Raich, director of equity research at the National City Private Client Group in Cleveland, said, ''if the Fed is going to get aggressive from here, it could give a boost to stocks later in the year.'' 
 Aggressive rate cuts could also shorten the duration or severity of a slowdown.
 In most cases, stocks tend to rebound as the economy emerges from a recession. The S.& P. study found that after 10 of the last 11 recessions, stocks soared in the ensuing six months. On average, the S.& P. index gained 12.1 percent.
 If you measure the market's performance from recession lows, rebounds are even more compelling. Ned Davis Research looked at the last 10 recessions and found that stocks rose 24 percent, on average, in the six months after hitting a recession low. That is why Tim Hayes, chief investment strategist at Ned Davis, said that while a recession could continue to pressure the stock market, ''it could also lead to a great buying opportunity.'' 
 Of course, there are no guarantees that the market will hit bottom in the middle of this slowdown. For instance, after the last recession ended in November 2001, stocks fell 18 percent over the next 12 months. 
 Still, there are reasons to believe that this will not be a repeat of the bear market of 2000-2. 
 For starters, Mr. Stovall said, ''valuations in the market lead me to believe that this market decline will end up being either a correction or a very light bear market.'' Although the price-to-earnings ratio of the S.& P. 500 approached 40 in the final stages of the 2001 recession, the ratio today is only around half of that, indicating that stocks aren't nearly as pricey.
 Moreover, Mr. Raich noted that while profits were likely to take a hit in an actual recession, the weakness in earnings in the third and fourth quarters of 2007 would make for relatively favorable comparisons in the second half of 2008. ''So there are some bright spots for the market,'' he said. ''They're just being overshadowed right now by all this recession talk.'' 

GRAPHIC: CHART: BEFORE DURING AND AFTER A DOWNTURN: Though stocks often drop in anticipation of recessions, they don't always lose ground during the actual period of contraction. Since 1945, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has gained 0.1 percent, on average, during official recessions. And once a recession ends, stocks usually rebound quickly.

 BODY:
SELECTED POEMS, by Derek Walcott. Edited by Edward Baugh. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $15.) Born on St. Lucia in 1930, Walcott was educated in Jamaica and has lived in Trinidad and in the United States, where he still teaches for part of the year at Boston University. Much of his work -- which includes 13 books of poetry and seven of plays as well as a volume of essays -- reflects his experience with colonial rule and its aftermath. ''How choose,'' he asked in an early poem, ''Between this Africa and the English tongue I love? / Betray them both, or give back what they give?'' This collection, edited by the Jamaican poet Edward Baugh, represents every stage of Walcott's long career, for which he won a Nobel Prize in 1992. ''Walcott has captured his islands with a lushness and richness rare in our poetry,'' our reviewer, William Logan, said. ''No living poet has written verse more delicately rendered or distinguished.'' 
 LETTER TO A CHRISTIAN NATION, by Sam Harris. (Vintage, $11.) After his book ''The End of Faith'' appeared, Harris, who is completing a doctorate in neuroscience, received thousands of letters, many of them hostile, about his lack of belief in God. This ''letter,'' addressed to fundamentalist Christians, is his reply. Harris addresses topics like intelligent design, stem-cell research and the role of religion in public life. ''The primary purpose of the book is to arm secularists ... against their opponents,'' he writes.
 ON ''THE WEALTH OF NATIONS,'' by P. J. O'Rourke. (Grove, $13.) Adam Smith's treatise revolutionized economic thought when it was published in 1776; it established the intellectual foundation of capitalism and free markets. But today few readers make it all the way through the more than 900 pages of Smith's convoluted prose. This book is a sort of ''hardcover blog, in which O'Rourke cites Smith's essential points, and riffs while preaching Smithian doctrine,'' Allan Sloan wrote in the Book Review. It is ''well worth reading. ... You'll see a primo stylist at work.''
 HEYDAY, by Kurt Andersen. (Random House, $15.95.) This ''band-concert of a novel ... a mighty busy and messy story,'' in the words of our reviewer, Geoffrey Wolff, is set in 1848, a year of upheaval around the world. Andersen's protagonist, a wealthy young Briton, has been involved in an accidental killing during the revolution in France and, pursued by the dead man's brother, he flees to New York. There he joins up with a firefighter and his sister (with whom he falls in love) and a roguish journalist. Eventually they make their way to the gold fields of California. ''Heyday'' is full, perhaps overfull, of ideas and period details, and several famous contemporaries -- Engels, Darwin, Stephen Foster -- make cameo appearances. But it's ''a sweet book, with a tropism toward redemption,'' Wolff said. 
 FAME JUNKIES: The Hidden Truths Behind America's Favorite Addiction, by Jake Halpern. (Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $13.95.) ''Why do countless Americans yearn so desperately for this sort of fame?'' Halpern asks. ''Why do others ... devote their entire lives to serving these people? And why do millions of others fall into the mindless habit of watching them from afar?'' Halpern ponders, and finally rejects, the dubious explanation that fame is physically addictive, but along the way he presents plenty of evidence, both funny and disturbing, about Americans' celebrity obsession. 
 FAMOUS WRITERS SCHOOL, by Steven Carter. (Counterpoint, $14.95.) In this clever epistolary novel, a clueless writing teacher criticizes the work of the three students who have signed up for his correspondence course. Writers, teachers and the nature of narrative itself are the subjects of this satire. 
 FEATHER IN THE STORM: A Childhood Lost in Chaos, by Emily Wu and Larry Engelmann. (Anchor, $14.95.) Even as a 3-year-old, Wu was a class enemy during the Cultural Revolution because her father was a well-known academic. He was dismissed from his university and publicly humiliated; he and his wife were exiled to separate towns, leaving their children in state care. The family was eventually reunited, but more suffering followed. ''This is what I still see and hear when I close my eyes and those times descend on me again,'' Wu writes. 
 JIMI HENDRIX TURNS EIGHTY, By Tim Sandlin. (Riverhead, $14.) In this comic novel, Woodstock-generation residents in 2022 stage a rebellion at an assisted-living center.
 THAT SWEET ENEMY. Britain and France: The History of a Love-Hate Relationship, by Robert and Isabelle Tombs. (Vintage, $19.95.) Married historians, one British, the other French, look at 300 years in the contentious relations between their countries. The book emphasizes the conflicts between 1689 and 1815, ending with Wellington's defeat of Napoleon (oddly, Waterloo Station was until recently the terminus of the Eurostar, which links London and Paris), but social and cultural matters also receive their due in this stylish synthesis.
 CON ED, by Matthew Klein. (Grand Central, $7.99.) This funny swindling-scam novel, set in the world of the Internet nouveaux-riches, is full of perfectly observed Northern California details.

HEADLINE: A City That Needs More Places to Sleep

BYLINE: By C. J. HUGHES

 BODY:
NEW hotel developments could add nearly 3,000 rooms to the Manhattan market in 2008, a supply increase that might siphon travelers away from existing properties just as economists are forecasting an economic slowdown, or even a recession.
 But hotel owners, developers, brokers and consultants are almost uniformly shrugging off any doom-and-gloom ideas about the year ahead. The market, they agree, remains underserved, with hundreds of hotel rooms lost to recent condominium conversions in recent years. 
 ''It's a nice place to live, but it's a lousy place to visit,'' said Thomas McConnell, a senior managing director at Cushman & Wakefield, the real estate services firm, referring to Manhattan's number of hotel rooms. Even 10,000 new rooms ''wouldn't wreck things,'' he added. ''It would normalize them,'' he said, ''because we're undersupplied.'' 
 According to industrywide estimates, Manhattan room rates are expected to rise by an average of 8 percent over last year, to around $320 a night, while per-room revenue is expected to grow 7 percent, on average. (In 2007, revenue jumped by a record 15 percent, according to PKF Consulting.) 
 Industry analysts say demand for the hotels opening this year will continue to come from European travelers who are taking advantage of favorable currency exchange rates. At the same time, analysts are also expecting that more American tourists will choose New York over European destinations like Paris, also because of the weak dollar. 
 Many of the nearly two dozen expected hotels in Manhattan -- some new construction, some the renovation of existing buildings -- will abut residential neighborhoods, while others will be in areas that historically have had few available accommodations. 
 Some of these areas, freshly scrubbed and revitalized, are emerging as trendy, like the Bowery, where the new 21-story Cooper Square Hotel is expected to open this summer. The $100 million project will include three bars, a restaurant and a small park. There will be 145 rooms, with 315 to 700 square feet each, according to Matthew Moss, a principal of the Peck Moss Hotel Group, its New York-based developer. Room rates have not been set, he said. 
 A few blocks to the southeast, on Allen Street on the Lower East Side, comes another gleaming high-rise hotel, Thompson LES. The $80 million, 21-story tower is expected to open in March, according to Michael Pomeranc, the developer. Its 170 rooms, measuring 350 to 1,700 square feet, will start at $300 a night, he said. 
 In TriBeCa, the Greenwich Hotel, from the actor Robert De Niro, will offer 88 rooms in a brick-faced building at North Moore and Greenwich Streets. 
 Midtown Manhattan will have several hotels coming on line as well. In August, there will be three from McSam Hotel LLC on West 39th Street: a Holiday Inn Express, with 210 rooms; a Candlewood Suites, with 188 rooms; and a Hampton Inn, with 186 rooms, according to Beth Loetterle, a spokeswoman for McSam Hotel, which is based in Great Neck on Long Island. The company is also developing a 113-room Wyndham Garden hotel, at 20 Maiden Lane in Lower Manhattan that is scheduled to open by April, she said. 
 Also this year, the refurbished Plaza Hotel near Central Park is set to open. Although most of its 460 rooms will be sold as apartments, this 19-story structure will also offer 130 traditional hotel suites, to be run by Fairmont Hotels and Resorts. 
 And in October, Hyatt Hotels will introduce its Andaz line at 75 Wall Street in the financial district, offering 250 rooms in a converted office tower, according to Ben Hakminian, a principal of the Hakminian Organization, its developer.
 Taken together, these properties will add only about 3,000 rooms -- a drop in the bucket in terms of supply in Manhattan, which has about 65,000 rooms, said John A. Fox, a senior vice president at PKF Consulting, whose clients include developers. 
 Overall occupancy rates have hovered around 85 percent for the last few years, versus around 65 percent nationwide, Mr. Fox said; the high rate suggests that many guests are often turned away. He added that it would take about 10,000 additional rooms in a short period to balance the supply-and-demand equation. (About 46 million people visited New York City last year, about 6 percent more than in 2006, according to the city's tourism agency.)
 It typically takes about three and a half years for a new hotel to move from conception to ribbon-cutting, and hotel developers can be known for changing their minds about how to most profitably use a property. 
 ''A lot of hotels are announced and not all are built,'' Mr. Fox said. ''Many are gleams in the eyes of developers.''
 But then again, the pendulum could swing the other way. In the late 1980s, for example, Times Square sites that now house the Doubletree Guest Suites, the Crowne Plaza and the Renaissance New York were initially considered for offices, according to Mr. McConnell at Cushman & Wakefield. 
 What also fluctuates is the availability of financing; in the early part of this decade, hotel developers ''were at the bottom of the food chain,'' Mr. Fox said. He said that banks had considered hotels to be too risky, preferring instead to lend money for residential developments, which have long-term leases.
 ALTHOUGH the current credit crisis has dealt a blow to some developers, analysts said they knew of no hotel projects in New York City that have been scuttled outright. Still, locking in loans for future projects has become trickier, said Michael Yanko, the chief executive of Horizen Global, a developer based in New York.
 His Zuri, a 178-room hotel that is expected to break ground this spring on West 23rd Street in the Flatiron District, had to turn to European banks to underwrite the $135 million project after many American investors balked, Mr. Yanko said. To be designed by the architect Carlos Zapata, who also designed the Cooper Square Hotel, the 24-story structure will have a 40-foot-long glass-bottomed Jacuzzi cantilevered over the sidewalk, he added. 
 In the meantime, Horizen is focused on completing its Vu Hotel, inside a 17-story converted former printing plant at 11th Avenue and West 48th Street, to be run by the Kimpton hotel chain with rates starting at $400 a night, Mr. Yanko said. The $140 million project is to open in June.
 Mr. Yanko dismisses any concerns about a recession this year, thanks to the steady influx of foreign visitors. ''The whole world will be able to afford to come here then,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Eve Thompson and Richard Robinson

BYLINE: By LINDA LEE

 BODY:
HER family and friends agreed: Eve Thompson, 47, was not the marrying kind.
 ''Marriage was never anything we talked about,'' said her friend Joyce Justus, who was representing the Clinton White House when she met Ms. Thompson a decade ago in South Africa. ''Eve was always very busy, and interested in doing something important in the world.''
 Nonetheless, Ms. Thompson's father, Stafford W. Thompson, held out hope. ''He's more old-fashioned and wanted his daughters to be married and happy,'' said her mother, Betti Thompson. ''To me, being married isn't the be-all and end-all.'' 
 Nor was it to Eve Thompson, who grew up in Red Bank, N.J., and graduated from Princeton and Georgetown law school. She thrived in a series of high-powered jobs, for nongovernmental agencies, promoting education and helping countries develop and manage public policy. 
 It was in 1997 at a meeting at the Fort Hare Institute of Government in South Africa that she met Richard Robinson, who was the resident Fulbright scholar. Her first thought about him was, ''Here comes another white man to save Africa.'' 
 But Mr. Robinson, the son of Methodist missionaries, was born and spent most of his childhood in the Belgian Congo, now known as Congo. ''In some ways he's more African than I am,'' she said. 
 They shared a vision for justice and economic development and were both at ease in moving from culture to culture. But as for developing a relationship, there was no inkling. At the time, Mr. Robinson was married to his second wife, with whom he had three sons. 
 Their work kept Ms. Thompson and Mr. Robinson in touch over the years, even after she moved to Jordan, as the interim director of a United Nations leadership institute, and he moved back to Congo, whose capital is Kinshasa, to lead a public-private partnership to improve mining practices. 
 Eventually, he revealed that his marriage had begun to fray. She urged him to work it out. Shortly after his divorce in 2005, he called her in Brazil, where she had gone to learn Portuguese.
 He had always been impressed, he said in an interview by e-mail, with her ''elegant beauty and natural sensitivity.'' But now he began to feel something more: ''So alive with being connected with a friend with whom I share so much, and then amazingly, like lightning, I felt the romance and excitement.'' 
 Ms. Thompson, comfortable and set in her single life, seemed unaware of his growing feelings. ''Our conversations were so easy,'' she said. ''We just felt comfortable together, in each other's company. I found a real connection to him.''
 He told her he was going to Washington for a conference and because he was flying so far west to get to the United States, he suggested she head north to meet in Miami. She agreed. 
 ''Even then,'' her sister Gail Thompson said, ''she didn't describe him as a guy who would fly around the world to see her.'' 
 But, because of Hurricane Rita, their flights to Miami were canceled, leading to an impromptu rendezvous instead in downtown Newark. Ms. Thompson purchased ''Lion King'' tickets for them and during dinner conversation, she told him that she had been thinking of joining the Brahma Kumaris, who advocate avoidance of meat, alcohol, materialism and sex. 
 Mr. Robinson, 56, a Buddhist, admired her spirituality, but, ''I said to myself, 'Oh boy, I have a real challenge here.'<0>''
 The next morning, as she spoke to her mother on the phone, she mentioned that she paid $250 a ticket for the show. Ms. Thompson recalled her mother's response: ''I hope you slept with him, at least.''
 ''He made his move,'' Eve Thompson recalled, ''and, to answer my mother's question: I did.'' 
 Their work kept them apart for a year: she was in Guinea-Bissau in West Africa and Nigeria and he in Congo. But he called her every day, and during one of those calls he proposed. ''He was serious, and I just laughed,'' she said. ''I didn't give him a definitive response. My memory is a bit fuzzy of when I said yes.''
 But the geography of their relationship had changed. They met on whirlwind encounters in 14 countries, and on one of those trips, they bought her engagement ring in Edinburgh. 
 They were married on Dec. 29 by the Rev. Glen Robyne, a United Methodist minister and Mr. Robinson's nephew, at the Old Spanish Monastery in North Miami Beach. The nondenominational service had American Indian touches and also included a friend reading a Portuguese poem and Mr. Robinson's oldest son, Lawrence, reading a French poem. 
 Several guests said that they had come halfway around the world to witness the wedding of Ms. Thompson, who had an explanation for why she finally said yes.
 ''When he looks into my eyes,'' she said, ''there is adoration there that makes me feel wonderful about me. That's what you should really look for in someone. Because if you feel wonderful about yourself, you can do things.''

 CORRECTION:
The Vows column last Sunday, about the marriage of Eve Thompson and Richard Robinson, misidentified which member of the couple paid $500 for a pair of tickets to ''The Lion King'' while they were dating. It was Mr. Robinson, not Ms. Thompson.

 BODY:
THE MIGHTY WURLITZER 
 How the CIA Played America. 
 By Hugh Wilford. 
 Illustrated. 342 pp. Harvard University Press. $27.95. 
 This is a book whose content somewhat contradicts its title. ''Mighty Wurlitzer'' was the metaphor Frank Wisner, the first chief of political warfare for the Central Intelligence Agency, used to describe the C.I.A.'s ''array of front organizations.'' They were, he said, ''capable of playing any propaganda tune he desired.'' But Wisner rather exaggerated what he was able to do, as one learns from this remarkably detailed and researched book by Hugh Wilford, a British scholar now at California State University, Long Beach. For these organizations were not exactly ''front organizations'' as the term was understood by the Communist Information Bureau, or Cominform, the model that the young C.I.A. was trying to match. 
 The Kremlin had set up the Cominform in the early years of the cold war to coordinate the activities of scores of Communist-controlled professional, artistic and intellectual groups, and the C.I.A. decided to create or influence its own array of organizations and publications among intellectuals, labor organizations and citizen groups. But the leaders of just about all of these groups had minds of their own, and most of the organizations had been established independently of the C.I.A. For example, the small magazines Partisan Review and The New Leader, which, Wilford says, received C.I.A. funds in one way or another, owed nothing to the agency, either in their founding or in their operations. The idea of ''fronts'' hardly applies to them. 
 There were indeed fronts directly established by the C.I.A. for a particular goal, and the story Wilford tells of them in ''The Mighty Wurlitzer'' is fascinating, involving a surprising collection of well-known figures in American life. Consider the Independent Service for Information, set up at Harvard specifically for the purpose of getting some young anti-Communist Americans to attend a huge youth festival being organized by the Communists in Vienna in 1959. This was one of a series of events in which the Soviet Union promoted its versions of peace and progress, as contrasted with the cold-war policies of the capitalist United States.
 A youthful Gloria Steinem had just spent a year and half in India, where, we are told, she befriended Indira Gandhi and the widow of the ''revolutionary humanist'' M. N. Roy, and had met a researcher who seems to have been a C.I.A. agent or contact. Attractive and progressive, Steinem was hired to run the I.S.I. and to recruit knowledgeable young Americans who could debate effectively with the Communist organizers of the festival, defending the United States against Communist criticism of segregation and other American failings. 
 Conservative student leaders certainly could have been found for this purpose, but they did not interest the C.I.A. or the I.S.I.: socialists and others on the non-Communist left had greater appeal because they would be more effective in reaching out to the European students who attended such festivals. One of those who went to Vienna was Zbigniew Brzezinski, then a Harvard graduate student; one of those who agonized over the offer of free transportation was Michael Harrington of the Young People's Socialist League. The offer was withdrawn, according to Harrington, when he insisted that he had to be free to criticize capitalism and Communism equally.
 The C.I.A.'s connections to the I.S.I. and a host of other organizations and publications was exposed in a storm of magazine and newspaper articles in 1967, and just about everything that had once been secret became public. Steinem stood up bravely: ''I was happy to find some liberals in government in those days who were farsighted and cared enough to get Americans of all political views to the festival,'' she told The New York Times. And to The Washington Post she said: ''In my experience the agency was completely different from its image: it was liberal, nonviolent and honorable.''
 Steinem was a ''witting'' participant. Many others dependent on C.I.A. backing were ''unwitting'' (the terms, it seems, were in common use in the agency), because the money they accepted was channeled through existing foundations or through organizations ostensibly set up by wealthy individuals. Generally, it appeared that the funds were independent of the government. (The sums seem remarkably small for the most part, though I have not factored in inflation.) 
 Whereas the C.I.A. created the I.S.I. for a specific purpose, its relationship to the American Federation of Labor and the Congress of Industrial Organizations, the subject of an important chapter on American trade unions, was utterly different. The labor organizations had existed before the C.I.A. and had long been fighting Communists on their own -- in American unions as well as in international trade union organizations. During the cold war they found common cause with the agency in battling Communist influence in foreign unions. But they had their own exceptionally qualified officials to conduct their foreign activities. In the A.F.L., probably the most important was Jay Lovestone, described by Wilford as ''a particularly fanatical and ruthless anti-Communist.'' 
 This remark illustrates Wilford's somewhat cool attitude toward what many saw, with some legitimacy, as a worldwide conflict between tyranny and freedom. Lovestone had been the leader of the American Communist Party until he was expelled by Stalin himself. Clearly he knew a great deal about Soviet Communism and would not brook any interference or accept any guidance from C.I.A. officials, who in those early days were often from Ivy League colleges. Lovestone called them ''fizz kids.'' Of course Lovestone was not dependent on C.I.A. money -- the A.F.L. had its own resources. But the C.I.A. was eager to support an organization like the A.F.L. in its anti-Communist work. Similarly with Walter and Victor Reuther in the C.I.O. 
 ''Newly available evidence,'' Wilford concludes, ''shows that the old imagery of puppet masters and marionettes fails utterly to capture the complexities of partnership between the Lovestoneites of the A.F.L. and the 'fizz kids' of the C.I.A.'' This will hardly be surprising to the knowledgeable. And Wilford explains that the C.I.A.'s involvement with the American Committee for Cultural Freedom, an influential cold-war association of writers and scholars dominated by New York intellectuals, was very much the same story.
 Even when C.I.A. control was greatest, many American anti-Communists saw themselves not as doing the agency's bidding but as pursuing common ends -- contesting Communist influence among intellectuals, trade unionists, blacks, women's groups, student groups and the like. There seem to be few cases where the C.I.A. wanted a group to do things that its leaders did not want to do. Rather, the issue that created conflict was generally the C.I.A. insistence on hiding its involvement -- concealing the source of money and swearing ''witting'' leaders to secrecy, with penalties if they revealed what they knew (though there seem to be no cases, at least in this book, where any penalties were imposed). 
 After the C.I.A.'s activities were exposed, there were few who said they had been used, though rather more who said they were sorry to have kept the C.I.A. connection secret. Norman Thomas is one who, according to Wilford, expressed regret. Along with Victor Reuther, Allard Lowenstein and Bayard Rustin, Thomas was involved with the C.I.A.-sponsored Committee on Free Elections in the Dominican Republic, which lent ''international credibility to a 1966 ballot effectively rigged against the socialist former president, Juan Bosch.'' This is one of those passages that lead a reader to wonder if Wilford has fully grasped the nature of the conflict between socialists and Communists at that time. After all, Thomas and Rustin were socialists; there must have been other reasons than Bosch's socialism that caused them to oppose him. 
 Thomas was an acquaintance of Allen Dulles, the director of central intelligence, and could call on him when there was a financial emergency. Likewise, Arthur Schlesinger Jr., a former member of the O.S.S., the predecessor to the C.I.A., personally knew senior officers of the agency and would brief them on cultural developments he was aware of. He frequently saw Frank Wisner, the manager of the Mighty Wurlitzer, ''on the Georgetown dinner party circuit,'' and they would commiserate about the debates New York intellectuals insisted on having over McCarthyism, which the C.I.A. found unhelpful. It was a time, as Wilford writes, ''when the alliance between cold-war anti-Communism and liberal idealism still appeared natural and right.'' That alliance explains much that current readers may find surprising in this book. It explains as well the outrage many writers have expressed about the C.I.A. connection over the past few decades. 
 There is a great deal to be learned from this book. Wilford has consulted an astonishing number of scholarly and popular accounts, along with the papers and records of some of the central participants and organizations. He's done a remarkable job of research. If, on occasion, he doesn't appear in full command of the story, I would trace that to his inability to see the degree to which the Communists were pariahs to the anti-Stalinist left. So, when he writes that ''much of the American left had rejected the Dewey commission's finding that Trotsky was innocent of the charges leveled against him by Stalin,'' one wonders just what ''left'' he could possibly have in mind. I suspect it is those who were Communist-influenced or sympathetic to the Soviet Union. There aren't many such slips, however. Wilford has mastered an enormously complex tale in almost every detail.

HEADLINE: The Names Stay Linked: 'Bagel King' And Tankleff

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT, PAUL VITELLO and NATE SCHWEBER

 BODY:
This article is by Bruce Lambert, Paul Vitello and Nate Schweber.
 He called himself the Bagel King of Long Island, and with dozens of stores and franchise contracts, Jerard Steuerman could reasonably claim the title. 
 His flamboyant, self-promoting persona -- complete with a gold bagel pendant necklace and a '60s-style Afro -- lent itself to fancy cars, flashy rings and a gambling habit.
 He charmed some and he frightened others, and in 1983, he entered the lives of Seymour Tankleff, an insurance broker turned investor, and his wife, Arlene, who lived in Belle Terre, on the North Shore of Long Island.
 The two men became business partners. Mr. Steuerman, heavily in debt, borrowed $500,000 at a high interest rate from Mr. Tankleff. And on the eve of Sept. 7, 1988, Mr. Steuerman attended a poker game at the Tankleffs' home, leaving before the couple were found assaulted: Mrs. Tankleff dead and her husband mortally wounded. Shortly afterward, he left for California under an assumed name. 
 Mr. Steuerman, now 68 and living in a condominium in Boca Raton, Fla., has been a figure in the case from the start, ever since the Tankleffs' killings and the arrest of their son, Martin H. Tankleff, then 17, two decades ago. 
 To some -- notably Mr. Tankleff and those who supported his claim of innocence -- he has always seemed a likely suspect in the crimes.
 To others -- including the Suffolk County police and prosecutors -- he was simply a bystander, a businessman who might have made mistakes but who did not commit murder. 
 With the events of recent weeks, however, have come renewed questions. 
 Martin Tankleff is free after 17 years in prison, his conviction overturned by a state appellate court. But the charges against him are still in place. Gov. Eliot Spitzer has appointed a special prosecutor, Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo, whom a court has given 30 days to decide how to proceed. 
 Mr. Steuerman is now a wild card in a 20-year-old mystery, his past and his relationship with the Tankleffs once again the object of scrutiny.
 He has denied under oath any involvement in the murders. For years, he has refused to comment publicly on the case. Repeated attempts to contact him by telephone for this article, including a message left with his son, were unsuccessful. An employee at one of his stores said that Mr. Steuerman was unavailable and had no comment. A security officer and a sheriff's deputy barred a reporter from entering Willowwood Gardens, the gated condominium community where Mr. Steuerman lives and serves on the board of directors.
 But interviews with neighbors, business associates and others who knew him in the 1980s -- as well as the accounts of witnesses whose testimony helped overturn Mr. Tankleff's conviction -- reveal him as a man of many contradictions. He was a shrewd businessman, with an eye for a deal, a skillful hand with a poker deck and a desire to impress. He was also a lavish spender who by his own account lived beyond his means, a high-stakes gambler whose losses outpaced his gains, and a father whose son was convicted of dealing cocaine in one of his stores. 
 A Bond in Business
 When Jerard Steuerman and Seymour Tankleff crossed paths in 1983, it was through the bagel business, the Steuerman family's occupation for four generations.
 In the early 1900s Jerard Steuerman's grandfather, Jakob Frutchman, emigrated from Austria and opened a bagel bakery in a Manhattan basement, according to a Web site for Strathmore Bagels, the chain founded by Mr. Steuerman. 
 As a young man, Mr. Steuerman toiled in a factory so hot and steamy from the big kettles boiling bagels and the coal-fired ovens baking them that workers stripped to their underwear, according to an article in Newsday in 1986.
 But Mr. Steuerman had bigger plans. He branched out to Long Island, opening a bagel shop in Merrick in the 1960s, then expanding into Suffolk County in the 1980s. 
 Nicholas Argyros, a co-owner of the Bagel Chalet in Commack, who was Mr. Steuerman's business partner for several years in the 1980s, remembers him as ''a stand-up guy.''
 His opinion of Mr. Steuerman, he said, is ''all positives.''
 Some workers in Mr. Steuerman's bagel stores sensed another side. 
 ''I still get goose bumps when I hear his name,'' said Rebecca Keeler, who as a teenager worked for three years at bagel stores owned by Mr. Steuerman in Stony Brook and East Setauket.
 ''He wore his Capezios and gold rings, pinkie rings,'' she said. ''He tried to be funny, to be everybody's friend,'' but people often shied away from him.
 One customer at Mr. Steuerman's bagel stores was Seymour Tankleff, an insurance broker who had sold his business and was seeking companies to invest in, said Ron Falbee, a nephew of the Tankleffs and executor of their estate. Like Mr. Steuerman, Mr. Tankleff was the descendant of recent immigrants: his father, after arriving in New York from Russia, started a chain of poultry stores in Brooklyn.
 Mr. Tankleff and Mr. Steuerman became business partners, but their financial relationship soon grew more complicated. Mr. Tankleff lent money on the side, often at very high interest rates. At some point, he began making loans to Mr. Steuerman, Mr. Falbee said, initially to finish building a spacious two-story home in Belle Terre, where the Tankleffs also had a large house.
 The clifftop bluffs on the North Shore of Long Island have long been a coveted spot for the rich. The Astors and Morgans built summer cottages there at the turn of the last century. Mr. Tankleff and Mr. Steuerman were part of a new entrepreneurial elite that had settled there by the 1980s: car dealers, real estate lawyers, small-business owners and investors like Mr. Tankleff, many looking for big returns in a time then known as the go-go decade.
 Mr. Steuerman's house in Belle Terre house was one of 10 addresses in Suffolk and Nassau Counties listed in his name from 1983 to 2006. One of those was a gray beach house overlooking the bay in Mount Sinai that Mr. Steuerman rented in the early 1980s.
 Charles and Nancy West, who lived next door, described him as an ostentatious man who drove a Jaguar and took frequent trips to Florida. 
 He was a difficult neighbor, they said. People came and went at all hours of the day and night. On the Fourth of July, there were noisy fireworks displays. Once the barrage was so intense that the Wests, fearing their home would burn down, called the Fire Department.
 More than once, Mrs. West recalled, people drove up to the house ''in the middle of the night,'' and there were angry exchanges about drug use. 
 ''It happened a few times,'' said Mrs. West, who is 68 and a retired schoolteacher. 
 Mr. West said that he complained about Mr. Steuerman to the police but was told that nothing could be done. 
 ''It was so bad that we said, 'If he buys that house, we're selling,'<0>'' Mr. West recalled.
 It was a complicated time for Mr. Steuerman and his family. In 1983, his son Todd was arrested for selling cocaine at a bagel store where he worked; his lawyer in the case was Gerard Sullivan, a law partner of Thomas J. Spota, now the Suffolk County district attorney. According to the police report, Todd Steuerman, who was convicted and placed on probation, told an undercover officer: ''Just call here any time you want more blow. My father owns the place, so it's cool.''
 Mr. Steuerman himself was facing increasing debt.
 Lou Bove, 50, the son of Vincent Bove, the village's former mayor, who played poker with Mr. Tankleff and Mr. Steuerman, said he had always liked Mr. Steuerman but was aware of his faults.
 ''Jerry was a nice guy,'' Mr. Bove said, but ''he had a very bad gambling problem.''
 In the years before Seymour and Arlene Tankleff were murdered, Mr. Steuerman piled up gambling debts at casinos including Harrah's Marina and Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino, according to court records. 
 By 1988, Mr. Tankleff had lent Mr. Steuerman more than $500,000, at an interest rate of about 35 percent, secured by shares in his bagel stores and several racehorses. But ''the partnership was deteriorating,'' Mr. Falbee said, because Mr. Steuerman had stopped repaying the loans and he and Mr. Tankleff were fighting for control of the bagel stores. 
 In the months before his death, Mr. Tankleff had demanded an immediate cash payment of $50,000, and Mr. Steuerman resisted, according to members of the Tankleff family. Two weeks before the attacks, Arlene Tankleff told her sister, Marcella Alt Falbee, that she was afraid of Mr. Steuerman, according to court records. Ms. Falbee quoted her sister as saying that when Seymour Tankleff had tried to collect money, Mr. Steuerman angrily grabbed him, pulled him across a counter and said, ''I'll cut your throat.''
 The Son Is Blamed
 Seymour and Arlene Tankleff were found stabbed and bludgeoned in their home about 6 a.m. on Sept. 7, 1988. A Tuesday night poker game known as ''the After Dinner Club'' had ended about three hours earlier.
 Mr. Steuerman was among a group who often attended, along with Mayor Bove and other prominent residents of Belle Terre. He was the last to leave the Tankleff house that night, sometime after 3 a.m., he said.
 Dr. Frank Oliveto, an orthopedic surgeon who also attended the poker game, said that nothing unusual happened during the seven-hour game, though Seymour Tankleff and Mr. Steuerman ''were cool to each other,'' as they had been for months. 
 From the outset, Suffolk County police and prosecutors cast the Tankleff murders as an allegory about the dangers of growing up rich in a place like Belle Terre. They quickly pursued charges against the Tankleffs' 17-year-old son, who, they said, murdered his parents in a fit of anger about privileges denied, and with a cold eye on $3 million he would inherit when he was 25. 
 Martin Tankleff, his lawyers and a cadre of aunts and uncles familiar with the Tankleffs' business affairs insisted that Mr. Steuerman should be considered a suspect. 
 But within six hours after the bodies were found, the Suffolk County police, led by Detective K. James McCready, extracted a confession from Martin Tankleff, albeit one he never signed and quickly retracted. 
 A witness tracked down by investigators working for Martin Tankleff would later say that Mr. McCready, a building contractor on the side, had a business relationship with Jerard Steuerman before the murders, though Mr. McCready denied knowing him.
 Hours after the crimes, according to Mr. Falbee, the Tankleff estate executor, Mr. Steuerman withdrew $15,000 from a bank account that Mr. Falbee said was financed by Mr. Tankleff. A week later, Mr. Steuerman disappeared, leaving notes behind to fake his death and instructing his children and a girlfriend on how to collect his life insurance policy. 
 Suffolk County authorities did not consider Mr. Steuerman a suspect, but they wanted him to testify at Martin Tankleff's trial in 1990. Police tracked him down in California, where, beard shaved and hairpiece changed, he had spent some time at the famed Esalen Institute in Big Sur, relaxing and receiving psychotherapy. He was traveling under the name Jay Winston, one of many names he used in his business and personal lives. 
 Mr. Steuerman told the police he had run away to escape personal problems.
 ''The only mistake I made in my life is that I lived lavishly,'' Mr. Steuerman testified at the trial. ''I was a poor man living like a millionaire.''
 Referring to his flight after the murders, Mr. Steuerman told the jury: ''I did a foolish thing. But I am no murderer and I should not be here.''
 In the years after Mr. Tankleff's conviction in 1990, Mr. Steuerman's business flourished. He secured franchise deals to open bagel shops at major airports, including Kennedy International, and at rest stops along the New York State Thruway and the New Jersey and Florida Turnpikes. After a few years, he and his second wife, Sharon, moved to Florida.
 A New Theory
 In 2003, Jay Salpeter, a private investigator who began looking into the case on behalf of Martin Tankleff and his family, began to piece together a startling alternate version of the crimes, one that centered on Mr. Steuerman. Several witnesses unearthed by Mr. Salpeter, including two ex-convicts, implicated Mr. Steuerman in recruiting two hit men, Joseph Creedon and Peter Kent, to kill the Tankleffs, and in signaling them to enter the Tankleff house before he left the poker game. (One witness later retracted his story; another once said he had concocted his story but later swore an affidavit affirming it and has maintained it ever since.) 
 In 2006, a Suffolk County Criminal Court judge, Stephen L. Braslow, dismissed the testimony as given by ''a cavalcade of nefarious scoundrels.'' 
 But last month, the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court overturned Mr. Tankleff's conviction in the murders, noting that whatever the witnesses' character flaws, many did not know one another and gave their testimony independently. 
 What happens next will depend on the path of Mr. Cuomo's investigation, an undertaking that he has acknowledged will be difficult, given that the trail is 20 years cold. Yet at some point, it will almost certainly make a stop at a condominium on Willowwood Drive in Boca Raton.
 Ralph Tamburro, who lived next door to Mr. Steuerman on Empress Pines Drive in Nesconset in the years immediately after the Tankleff murders, remembers a man very different from the flashy, disruptive neighbor the Wests knew in Mount Sinai a decade before.
 Mr. Steuerman, Mr. Tamburro said, was a quiet man, who ''kind of kept to himself.''
 ''He was pleasant; there were never any problems,'' Mr. Tamburro said.

HEADLINE: Dr. Jekyll Meets Mr. Hybrid

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE ULRICH

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
 ANY environmentalist, faced with the blaring soundtracks and flashy unveilings during the press previews of the North American International Auto Show, could be forgiven for thinking he had stepped into a bizarre stage production called ''Jekyll and Hyde: The Motown Musical.''
 For every earth-hugging citizen like the Mercedes-Benz S300 Bluetec Hybrid or Toyota A-BAT hybrid truck, there was a hard-drinking V-8 pickup or a sinister sports car out to murder your m.p.g. Those dueling automotive natures were much in evidence at this year's show, which opened to the public Saturday and runs through Jan. 27.
 Ford and Dodge pulled the plus-size wrappers off their respective F-150 and Ram pickups. Designed to compete against the equally big boys from General Motors, Toyota and Nissan, the trucks will also battle a sales climate that has turned chilly for thirsty trucks and S.U.V.'s. 
 Toyota announced that it planned to develop a plug-in version of its Prius hybrid sedan by 2010, setting up a challenge to G.M. and its plans to market the plug-in Chevrolet Volt. But Toyota also showed a new roadster version of last year's 200-mile-an-hour Lexus LF-A supercar concept, whose gasoline V-10 kicks out more than 500 horsepower.
 Robert A. Lutz, G.M.'s vice chairman, whose own public conversion into a supporter of hybrids and electric vehicles mirrors his company's, managed to plug together the industry's continuing disconnect between fuel economy and horsepower. 
 ''The analogy I like to use is that, at the height of the vegetarian craze, the grocery stores are still stocked with New York steaks,'' Mr. Lutz said. 
 For G.M., the bloody red meat included the heart-palpitating Chevrolet Corvette ZR1, a 620-horsepower, $100,000 sports car, and the 550-horsepower Cadillac CTS-V sport sedan. Apparently representing the vegan team were the Saturn Vue Green Line two-mode hybrid and its plug-in hybrid sibling, along with the Saturn Flextreme hybrid concept car and hydrogen-powered Cadillac Provoq concept.
 The ongoing mashup of the S.U.V. continued with multiple unveilings of crossover models that blended features of sport utilities, pickups, station wagons, even coupes and sports cars. 
 Some, like the Toyota Venza crossover wagon that goes on sale late this year, seemed to strike at the heart of the market. Others, like the BMW X6, which highlighted an S.U.V. design trend toward stylishly sloping roofs that can impinge on passenger or cargo space, will seek buyers who are willing to trade practicality for looks. 
 Five Chinese automakers displayed their wares in Detroit, four more than last year. And while analysts expect China to modernize its car industry in much less time than it took Japan and Korea, the quaint models they showed -- none certified to American emissions or safety standards, let alone the minimum requirements of picky consumers -- proved that they have miles to go. 
 International auto intrigue aside, the Detroit show seemed particularly strong this year in both the breadth and depth of its offerings, from intriguing design studies to eagerly awaited production models. 
 These were among the future showroom models spotlighted in Detroit: 
 FORD F-150 America's best-selling vehicle for 26 years, the F-Series pickup is Ford's biggest remaining franchise, but it's no longer impregnable. To keep rivals in its mirrors, Ford introduced a 2009 F-150 so macho it could make Stanley Kowalski tremble. The pickup features familiar 4.6-liter and 5.4-liter V-8s, with F-150 diesel and turbo V-6 options arriving in 2010. 
 CORVETTE ZR1 If a $100,000 Corvette sounds expensive, consider that the ZR1 is designed to meet or beat Ferraris and other supercars at double or triple the price, even with its cheesy see-through hood panel. The 620-horsepower 6.2-liter V-8 revealed beneath the hood can propel the ZR1 to a top speed of more than 200 m.p.h. 
 DODGE RAM Accompanied by 120 Texas Longhorns outside Cobo Center, the Dodge Ram rolled into public view with familiar cowpoke styling, but more city-slicker features. Dodge's first-ever pickup with a so-called crew-size cab -- it steals inches from the bed to expand the back seat -- uses a coil-spring suspension to improve ride and handling. A more muscular Hemi V-8 pumps out 380 horsepower; Hemi Hybrids and higher-mileage diesels are coming in 2010. 
 TOYOTA VENZA On sale late this year, the Venza is a ''crossover sedan'' in Toyota parlance. Which is to say it looks like an Avalon turned into a station wagon. 
 HYUNDAI GENESIS Hyundai continues its brave march into unfamiliar sales territory with the full-size Genesis luxury sedan. The Genesis will get 3.5-liter and 3.8-liter V-6 engines as well as a 4.6-liter V-8, Hyundai's first, that makes 375 horsepower. The starting price is likely to be about $30,000. 
 CADILLAC CTS-V G.M.'s bid to overwhelm high-performance models from BMW's M works and Mercedes's AMG division, the CTS-V reaches showrooms this fall, powered by a version of the Corvette ZR1's supercharged 6.2-liter V-8 with an estimated -- and class-leading -- 550 horsepower. Likely to have a starting price below $60,000, the Caddy will offer a six-speed automatic. 
 HONDA PILOT Some media grumbling could be heard at the auto show over the redesigned Pilot's squared-off styling. But Honda said its popular eight-passenger hauler would be more space-efficient inside, with a man-size third row. A V-6 capable of switching to three- or four-cylinder operation to save fuel will be standard when the Pilot goes on sale in the spring. 
 VOLKSWAGEN PASSAT CC Borrowing its design theme from the Mercedes CLS, the Passat CC is a four-door coupe whose arching roofline is meant to disguise a practical sedan layout. It worked for Mercedes, though the conservative VW doesn't begin to approach the Benz's traffic-stopping style. The CC goes on sale later this year. 
 Automakers also unveiled a number of design studies that offered a hint of future styling and technology. Among the highlights:
 CAdillac CTS Coupe The surprise of the show, this proposal for a two-door version of the CTS sedan managed the rare feat of avoiding Web spoilers and spy photographers before its unveiling. The CTS's enormous rump wasn't to everyone's taste, but the aggressive-looking coupe is almost certain to be penciled into G.M.'s product plans. 
 TOYOTA A-BAT Billed by Toyota as the offspring of a Prius and a military truck -- hybrid Hummer, anyone? -- the A-BAT is a pint-size pickup that seems likely to reach production. Not everyone liked the design, evocative of the Honda Ridgeline, but the A-BAT's clever packaging, including a hatch in the rear of the cab, was not in doubt. 
 FORD EXPLORER AMERICA This design study shows Ford contemplating a fairly radical change for a redesigned Explorer due around 2010, not surprising considering its sales have dropped by two-thirds since 2000. The Explorer America is a brawny, yet streamlined S.U.V. built on a car platform, with the turbocharged direct-injection engines that Ford is promoting for fuel-saving.
 MERCEDES-BENZ VISION GLK Where other compact S.U.V.'s have gone all curvy, the GLK is practical and square. Like the BMW X6, the GLK did not arrive to universal acclaim; in this case, critics griped about the boxy body and a tri-star nose emblem the size of a wall clock. Based on the new C-Class, the GLK will go on sale next January.
 Saturn Vue Green Line Hybrids To go on sale in the fall, the Vue two-mode hybrid is expected to deliver roughly 28 m.p.g. in combined city-highway driving. This vehicle will become G.M.'s fourth S.U.V. with the new two-mode hybrid system. 
 LINCOLN MKT Based on the coming Ford Flex crossover, the huge MKT ditched the Flex's third row in favor of airliner-like accommodations -- and I don't mean coach -- for four. A twin-turbocharged V-6 would turn out 415 horsepower, at least in theory. Exterior panels are fashioned from recycled soda bottles, but the inside is decadent, with an instrument panel inspired by Swarovski crystal, all topped by a glass roof. 
 MERCEDES-BENZ S300 BLUETEC HYBRID A sumptuous S-Class sedan that could sip fuel at 44 m.p.g.? That's Mercedes's claim for this four-cylinder diesel-hybrid S300. What many media outlets didn't catch is that there are no plans to sell the S300 in the United States. Americans, Mercedes officials confirmed, will almost certainly see a V-6 hybrid S-Class instead, around 2009. 
 HUMMER HX Hummer soothed the auto-show masses with talk about the HX's compact size and V-6 efficiency. But come on: this angry-baby Hummer is all about the styling. With a smaller H4 Hummer on the horizon, the only question is how much of this Baja-racer look will make it into production. Interestingly, Jeep took a similar, if softer, styling path with its Renegade concept, a roofless hybrid with dune-buggy looks. 
 FORD VERVE The flat-out lovely Verve garnered high praise at the show, along with left-handed remarks that Ford should have the small notchback sedan in showrooms now, rather than in 2010. An equally striking two-door hatchback is officially for Europe only.

HEADLINE: Number of Rooms Can't Meet Surging Demand

BYLINE: By DAVID KAUFMAN

 BODY:
AS if the sagging dollar and soaring oil costs weren't enough to dent travel budgets, hotel room rates are expected to surge in the coming year. From New York to Asia, and just about every desirable destination in between, the prices of rooms -- especially at hotels and resorts favored by luxury and business travelers -- are expected to rise significantly, sometimes in the double digits, analysts say.
 A shortage of rooms is to blame. ''Supply is simply not keeping up with demand,'' said Jan D. Freitag, vice president for global development at Smith Travel Research in Nashville. ''So hotels can -- and do -- command premiums for any rooms they can sell.''
 While the situation is acute in traditional high-cost cities such as New York -- where room rates rose 15.4 percent last year to an average of $320.87, according to a recent American Express report -- some of the strongest gains are in Asia. 
 In India, an increasingly popular tourist destination, hotel room rates are up 48 percent this year nationwide and a whopping 69 percent in its commercial capital of Mumbai, according to a recent Smith Travel report. India has only about 100,000 hotel rooms nationwide, roughly the same number as in New York City, though India has seven or eight times the number of tourists. As a result, hotel rates in India will continue to grow in 2008. An increase of ''up to 35 and even 40 percent in the coming year,'' would not be unrealistic, said Priscilla Campbell, an analyst for American Express Business Travel, ''especially at upper-tier properties in major gateways such as New Delhi and Mumbai.'' In Mumbai, a long-awaited 231-room Four Seasons Hotel, in the vanguard of a hotel building boom that should help alleviate the shortage, opens later this winter. 
 Costs in China -- not surprisingly -- are expected to surge because of the Summer Olympic Games, both in their host city of Beijing and in other cities such as Shanghai and Hong Kong. Double-digit increases should be anticipated in these cities in 2008 -- on top of increases in 2007 that reached nearly 15 percent in Hong Kong and between 5 and 7 percent in Shanghai and Beijing, according to Smith Travel. Rates are likely to stabilize somewhat later this year, thanks to a huge number of new rooms, including 14,000 in Beijing alone by summer. ''There should be a post-Olympic lull,'' said Mr. Freitag of Smith Travel. He suggested looking for fall deals.
 The rest of Asia is on the rise. Vietnam, for instance, is contending with circumstances similar to India's: surging interest from leisure and business travelers, a scarce supply of top-tier hotel rooms and new projects still years from completion. As a result, hotel rates were up some 40 percent last year, according to Smith Travel, while rooms in nearby Singapore rose 36 percent. 
 Even destinations rapidly adding capacity such as the Persian Gulf states are not immune to the rate surge, especially Dubai, where hotel rooms rose nearly 24 percent last year, Mr. Freitag said.
 Deals will be harder to come by in many cities in the United States and Europe next year. As in Asia, major centers such as New York, London and Paris are contending with tight supply amid soaring demand. Business and leisure travelers ''are essentially competing with each other for whatever rooms are available,'' said Ms. Campbell. London, for instance, had average occupancy rates that reached 80 percent last year, while New York hit just above 83 percent. As a result, hotel rates have risen dramatically: up almost 30 percent last year in London and Paris, and up between 15 and 21 percent in Rome, Toronto and Los Angeles, according to Smith Travel.
 Prices are expected to climb further in 2008 -- especially at the luxury level -- by between 5 and 8 percent in the United States and 12 to 14 percent in Europe, according to American Express. But at least in the United States, rates will begin to level out by the end of the year, Mr. Freitag said. ''New construction is finally increasing,'' he said, ''so we can look for some sort of price equilibrium.'' This year, 115,000 new hotel rooms are expected to be added to the United States market, according to PKF Hospitality Research in Atlanta, the largest increase since 2000. 
 Occupancy levels and room prices will continue to rise in New York next year far out of proportion to those of the rest of the United States. ''New York operates in its own little universe,'' Mr. Freitag said. Still, the city is beginning to see new hotel growth. In December, the 45-room Duane Street Hotel opened in TriBeCa, with special opening rates starting under $300. 
 Although they will be much harder to secure in 2008, savings will be available even in the highest-cost destinations for travelers willing to work for them. Henry H. Harteveldt, travel analyst with Forrester Research in San Francisco, suggested opting for apartments instead of hotels for stays over four days or for small groups. ''They are far more economical and can feel much more like home,'' said Mr. Harteveldt, who suggested using Web sites such as Condo.com and HomeAway.com. ''This is something I actually did on a recent visit to New York.''
 City-center apartments offered by Sanctuary Villas & Apartments (www.sanctuary-villas.com), which is based in Britain, demonstrate the value of apartments over hotels. Their three-bedroom Venice apartment sleeps six and will cost $1,305 per night this year -- just $217.50 per person, substantially less than equivalent four- and five-star hotels. In Paris, their executive-friendly 8th and 16th Arrondissement apartments can be as little as $615 per traveler a night, far below the roughly $1,000 per night starting rate at the Four Seasons George V.
 Another option -- at least for leisure travelers -- is to choose destinations where prices have remained low or at least offer more for their money, suggested Ken Fish, owner of the luxury service Absolute Travel. ''Although costs have risen, Thailand is still a good value, both in Bangkok and in beach resorts,'' he said. Alternatively, trading lodge vacations in New Zealand and Australia for safaris in southern Africa is another way to better extend travel budgets. 
 For those who must travel to the priciest destinations such as New York or New Delhi, rest assured that relief is on the way, though not in the immediate future. India is in the midst of an ambitious plan to add some 75,000 hotel rooms before the end of the decade -- nearly half in the luxury sector. And both London and New York should welcome new capacity in the coming years -- the former in anticipation of the 2012 Olympic Games, the latter mostly in Brooklyn, where nearly 2,000 hotel rooms are to be built in its developing downtown in the next half decade. 
 ''These places are prepping for additional supply,'' Ms. Campbell said. ''So we can plan for some eventual easing for prices.'' 

CORRECTION-DATE: February 3, 2008

 CORRECTION:
An article on Jan. 20 about rising hotel rates around the world misstated the number of rooms in New York City in a comparison with those in India. The city has about 74,000 hotel rooms -- not 100,000, which is the estimated total for India.

HEADLINE: Blurring Reality's Edge in Fluid China

BYLINE: By DENNIS LIM

 BODY:
IN the movies of Jia Zhang-ke, it can often seem that all of modern China is a ready-made film set. Either that or Mr. Jia has an uncanny gift for the metaphorically charged location. His films have taken place within the plastic confines of an Epcot-like Beijing theme park (''The World''), amid the forlorn public spaces of a declining post-industrial city (''Unknown Pleasures'') and in an ancient riverside town that is about to disappear underwater (''Still Life,'' which won the top prize at the 2006 Venice International Film Festival and which opened in New York on Friday). 
 The story of a man and a woman on parallel quests to find their long-lost spouses, ''Still Life'' is set in Fengjie, 150 miles upstream from the Three Gorges Dam, the hydroelectric project on the Yangtze River that submerged thousands of towns and villages and displaced more than a million people. Shot while Fengjie was being demolished and prepared for its eventual flooding, the film has a powerful documentary flavor, but it also borders on the surreal. The protagonists wander through rubble-strewn wastelands. Entire buildings crumble on camera. The epic scale of the devastation matches, even as it violates, the region's majestic natural beauty. 
 ''Such a quick destruction of a 2,000-year-old town is simply unimaginable,'' Mr. Jia said, speaking through a translator while he was in town for the New York Film Festival in October. ''It's as if there was an alien invasion.'' (Accordingly Mr. Jia throws in a few sci-fi-like special effects: a stray U.F.O., a tower that takes off like a rocket.) 
 A meticulous record of a vanishing world -- Mr. Jia's cinematographer, Yu Lik-wai, surveys the wreckage with slow panning shots that evoke the horizontal expanse of Chinese scroll paintings -- ''Still Life'' is an act of commemoration and of stoic protest. ''I don't start from a political standpoint,'' Mr. Jia said. ''But if you make a film about China right now, you have to talk about the politics and the changes that are affecting people.'' 
 Convulsive change is the norm in capitalist China, and since it is also the subject of Mr. Jia's films, he said, ''I sometimes feel I'm racing against time.'' At 37 he has amassed a body of work -- seven feature-length fiction films and documentaries -- that is remarkable for its formal ambition, ethnographic richness and moral weight. 
 In an increasingly materialist society he gravitates to the have-nots. His films expose the social and spiritual disarray beneath what has been called the Chinese economic miracle. If they never seem dry or academic, it is because they invariably show how large, abstract forces (like modernization and globalization) bear down on individual lives. 
 Mr. Jia's first feature, ''Xiao Wu'' (1997), observes a small-town pickpocket as he struggles to adapt to the new black-market economy. His three-hour, decade-spanning follow-up, ''Platform'' (2000), traces the street-level effects of the ''open door policy'' of the 1980s by following the members of a provincial performance troupe from propaganda skits to break-dancing demonstrations. The film doubles as an autobiographical account of his formative years: Mr. Jia belongs to a generation that came of age as China was yielding to an influx of previously banned art, literature and philosophy. (And he was an avid break dancer.)
 ''Globalization is very complex in China,'' Mr. Jia said. ''It has accelerated the consumerist mind-set, but it has also allowed people more access, more information, more technology.'' His films are especially attentive to how young people absorb pop culture. Favorite songs acquire talismanic significance; nightclubs and karaoke bars are important locations. 
 His characters are as plugged-in as any citizens of the 21st century. (Plots often turn on ill-timed text messages and cellphone calls.) But any sense of connectedness is illusory, sharply contrasted with an inner loneliness and a lack of real-world mobility. This is the overriding point of ''The World'' (2004), whose characters work at the Beijing World Park, an actual tourist attraction filled with replicas of landmarks like the Taj Mahal and the Eiffel Tower. (The park's somewhat ominous slogan: ''See the world without ever leaving Beijing.'')
 Mr. Jia moves so fluidly between fiction and documentary that he often blurs the lines between them. While shooting ''Still Life'' he made a companion piece, ''Dong,'' a documentary on a painter and his subjects, demolition laborers in Fengjie and sex workers in Bangkok. Mr. Jia's latest feature, an essay-film called ''Useless'' that screened in the New York Film Festival last fall, compares the manufacture of clothing at a factory, a high-concept anticouture designer and a backwater tailor shop. The title is intended as a political point about art, artisanal work and the marketplace. ''If your films must make money before they can be considered useful, there's no space for independent films,'' he said.
 Mr. Jia is part of the sixth generation of Chinese filmmakers, which emerged in the 1990s with grungily realistic portrayals of contemporary China that stood apart from the historical epics that came before. (The fifth generation included filmmakers like Zhang Yimou and Chen Kaige, who propelled mainland Chinese cinema to world prominence with films like ''Raise the Red Lantern'' and ''Farewell My Concubine.'')
 Despite a relaxing of standards by the government film bureau, making and showing a movie in China remains a fraught and often confounding process. Scripts must be vetted ahead of time. Blacklisted directors face years-long bans. The young rebels of the sixth generation, like Mr. Jia, Zhang Yuan (''Beijing Bastards'') and Wang Xiaoshuai (''The Days''), were at first content to work outside the system; that was often the basis of their reputation. But there is limited career potential in being an underground filmmaker in China.
 ''It's the phenomenon of these directors having to confront the market,'' Shelly Kraicer, a film consultant in Beijing who programs for the Vancouver International Film Festival, said in an e-mail exchange. ''If they want to be seen by local audiences and want to receive financing from local companies, they have to make films that can earn a domestic box office return. Therefore they have to make films the Film Bureau can approve.'' 
 Mr. Kraicer added that while many of Mr. Jia's peers have had to compromise on the path to legitimacy, he has made the transition with credibility intact. His early unsanctioned films remain banned in China, but the state-run Shanghai Film Studio was a co-producer of ''The World'' and ''Still Life.'' ''Still Life'' in particular is openly critical of official policies and even alludes to the corruption that plagued the Three Gorges project. Speculating on why the film went into release untouched, Mr. Jia said: ''The impact of the Three Gorges project is phenomenal. It's not something the government can cover up.'' 
 The censors' rules are by no means straightforward. Consider the case of the director Lou Ye, whose ''Summer Palace'' also opened in New York Friday. The film contains nudity and partly concerns the Tiananmen Square crackdown of 1989, a touchstone event for many sixth-generation directors. After ''Summer Palace'' played at Cannes in 2006, Mr. Lou was slapped with a five-year ban from filmmaking. Initial reports attributed this to his failure to obtain permission to screen the film abroad, but Mr. Lou, speaking at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2006, said the Film Bureau's official reason was the movie's poor sound and picture quality. 
 Reached by e-mail recently Mr. Lou confirmed that the ban was still in effect and said he was planning another project. ''Working on a new film is the most interesting response to the ban,'' he said. This month Mr. Lou's producer, Fang Li, received a two-year ban for producing Li Yu's sexually candid drama ''Lost in Beijing'' (opening in New York on Friday).
 Mr. Jia's standing at home is catching up with his reputation among Western cinephiles and critics, Mr. Kraicer said, helped in part by the Venice prize. Now a prominent media figure, he has been outspoken about what he deems the bloated commercialization afflicting Chinese cinema. In a gesture of defiance Mr. Jia chose to open ''Still Life'' on the same day as Zhang Yimou's gaudy period blockbuster ''Curse of the Golden Flower,'' the most expensive Chinese film of all time. (''Still Life'' had only a brief theatrical run but sold well -- and was widely bootlegged -- on DVD.) 
 Mr. Jia is working on a short film for an omnibus tied to the Beijing Olympics and a feature about factory workers that spans the last five decades. For now he has somehow carved out a special position in Chinese film. 
 ''Chinese artists have always been engaged in careful balancing acts,'' Mr. Kraicer said. ''But Jia seems to span the two contradictory poles of cultural production. His work continues to be essentially uncompromising, but he has created a space in the public realm for it to exist.'' 
 Still, the taming of official authority is only part of the battle. ''Finding a paying audience is a completely different matter,'' Mr. Kraicer said. ''The fierce censorship of the Chinese market may be a hurdle that even someone like Jia can't surmount.''

''HAVE YOU SEEN THE ROMANIAN MOVIE?'' This somewhat improbable question began to circulate around the midpoint of the 2005 Cannes Film Festival. For some reason, the critics, journalists and film-industry hangers-on who gather in Cannes each May to gossip and graze rarely refer to the films they see there by their titles, preferring a shorthand of auteur, genre or country of origin (''the Gus Van Sant''; ''the Chinese documentary''; ''that Russian thing''). It's a code that everyone is assumed to know, and in this case there was not much room for confusion. How many Romanian movies could there be? 
 More than most of us would have predicted as it turned out. But for the moment we were happy to have ''The Death of Mr. Lazarescu,'' the second feature by Cristi Puiu, though given the movie's methods and subject matter there was perhaps something a little perverse in our joy. Its exotic provenance was not the only thing that made Puiu's movie sound like something only a stereotypical film snob could love. More than two and a half hours long, ''The Death of Mr. Lazarescu'' chronicles the last night in the life of its title character, a flabby 63-year-old Bucharest pensioner with a stomachache and a drinking problem. Filmed in a quasi-documentary style in drab urban locations -- a shabby apartment, the inside of an ambulance, a series of fluorescent-bulbed hospital waiting and examination rooms -- it follows a narrative arc from morbidity to mortality punctuated by casual, appalling instances of medical malpractice. 
 And yet viewers who witnessed poor Dante Lazarescu's unheroic passing on the grand screen of the Salle Debussy emerged from the experience feeling more exhilarated than depressed. ''The Death of Mr. Lazarescu'' is raw, melancholy and unflinching, but it is also lyrical, funny and, perhaps paradoxically, full of life. And though the wobbling camera and the use of unflattering available light create an atmosphere of tough, unadorned naturalism, the film is also, on closer inspection, a remarkably artful piece of work, with a strong, unpredictable story, rigorous camera work and powerfully understated performances. The excitement that greeted it came from the feeling that one of the oldest and strongest capacities of cinema -- to capture and illuminate reality, one face, one room, one life at a time -- had been renewed.
 When the festival was over, Cristi Puiu returned to Bucharest with an award, called Un Certain Regard, given to the best film in a side program that frequently upstages the main competition. The rest of us went home with the glow of discovery that is one reason we go to film festivals in the first place. This is not an especially unusual occurrence on the festival circuit. Every so often, a modest picture from an obscure place makes a big splash in the relatively small international art-film pond. But the triumph of ''Mr. Lazarescu'' in Cannes turned out to be a sign of things to come. In 2006, the year after ''Mr. Lazarescu,'' attentive Cannes adventurers would find room in their screening schedules for two new Romanian movies, Catalin Mitulescu's ''Way I Spent the End of the World'' and Corneliu Porumboiu's ''12:08 East of Bucharest,'' both of which dealt, albeit in very different ways, with the revolution of 1989. When the time came to hand out awards, Porumboiu won the Camera d'Or, given to the best debut feature. 
 A year later, the first film in the Cannes competition to be shown to the press was Cristian Mungiu's second feature, ''4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days,'' a harrowing, suspenseful story of illegal abortion and an unsparing portrait of daily life in the last years of Communist rule. By the end of the festival, ''the Romanian abortion movie'' (its inevitable and somewhat unfortunate shorthand designation) had overpowered a competitive field. There was much delight but no great surprise when Mungiu, a soft-spoken, round-faced 39-year-old, walked onto the stage of the Salle Lumiere on the last night of the festival to accept the Palme d'Or, the festival's top prize and a token of membership in the world fraternity of cinematic masters (or at least in a diverse club whose other recent inductees include Roman Polanski, Lars von Trier and Michael Moore). Earlier in the day, the Certain Regard jury (one of whose members was Cristi Puiu) gave its award to ''California Dreamin','' yet another Romanian movie whose director, the prodigiously talented Cristian Nemescu, died in a car accident the year before at the age of 27. 
 In three years, then, four major prizes at the world's pre-eminent film festival went to movies from a country whose place in the history of 20th-century cinema might charitably be called marginal. The post-Cannes triumphal march of ''4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days'' (it opens in New York on Friday) to the tops of English-language critics' polls and year-end lists, as well as to a Golden Globe nomination, offers belated confirmation of last spring's news flash from the Cote d'Azur. But perhaps you are hearing it here first: the Romanian new wave has arrived.
 IS THERE OR IS THERE NOT? 
 Such is the consensus, or at least the hype, within the worldwide critical community. In Romania itself, where Mungiu's Palme d'Or was front-page news and occasioned a burst of national pride (including a medal bestowed on the director by the country's president), there is a bit more skepticism. The Romanian title of ''12:08 East of Bucharest,'' the 2006 Camera d'Or winner, is ''Fost sau n-a fost,'' which translates as ''was there or was there not?'' The question is posed by the pompous host of a provincial television talk show to an undistinguished panel (consisting of an alcoholic schoolteacher, a semiretired Santa Claus and a desultory handful of callers) on the 16th anniversary of the revolution that overthrew Nicolae Ceausescu. The moderator wants his guests to address whether or not, in their sad little city in Moldavia (Porumboiu's hometown of Vaslui), the revolution really happened. A long and inconclusive debate follows, punctuated by verbal digressions and technical difficulties: a production assistant's hand reaches into the frame; the camera abruptly zooms in on the host's nose. (''At last, a close-up,'' he says). A discussion of contemporary Romanian cinema with Romanian filmmakers and critics can sometimes resemble that scene: ''Is there or is there not a Romanian new wave?'' Or, as it was put recently, with some irreverence, before a very distinguished panel at a contentious public debate held at the Romanian Cultural Institute in New York, ''Romanian Cinema: The Golden Age?'' 
 Compared with what? Romanian cinema, it will be pointed out, was not born with ''The Death of Mr. Lazarescu.'' As it happened, Cristian Mungiu's Palme d'Or arrived punctually on the 50th anniversary of the first Romanian Palme, awarded in 1957 to Ion Popescu-Gopo's ''Short History,'' a charming, wordless animated short in which human evolution and industrial development culminate in the planting of large daisylike flowers on distant planets. More to the point, there was a Romanian movie industry in the 1970s and '80s, and many of the filmmakers whose movies traveled the festival rounds in those days -- directors like Stere Gulea, Dan Pita and Mircea Daneliuc -- are still active. The younger generation, furthermore, does not necessarily represent a unified or coherent movement. 
 In an article published last summer in the English-language journal European Alternatives, Alex Leo Serban, one of Romania's leading film critics, instructed readers to keep in mind that ''there are no 'waves,' . . . just individuals.'' When I met him in Bucharest in November, Puiu, the director of ''Mr. Lazarescu,'' was more emphatic. ''There is not, not, not, not, not a Romanian new wave,'' he insisted, hammering the point home against the arm of his living-room couch. Puiu, who studied painting in Switzerland before turning to film, is given to grand, counterintuitive statements. (''I am not a filmmaker!'' he practically shouted at me when I asked him, in all innocence, what inspired him to become one.) To spend time with him -- as I discovered in the course of a long evening at his apartment, during which several bottles of Romanian wine and countless American cigarettes joined Mr. Lazarescu in the great beyond -- is to be drawn into frequent and fascinating argument. Over hors d'oeuvres, we stumbled into a friendly quarrel over the idea that anyone's life has ever really been changed by a book or a film, and as we ate roast lamb at Puiu's high, narrow kitchen table we debated whether or not a camera's zoom could be said to correspond to any activity of the human eye. 
 When it comes to new waves, the critics who announce (or invent) them have more of an investment than artists, who understandably resist the notion that their individuality might be assimilated into some larger tendency. Ever since the French Nouvelle Vague of the late 1950s and early '60s, cinephiles have scanned the horizon looking for movement. In Czechoslovakia before 1968, in West Germany and Hollywood in the 1970s and more recently in Taiwan, Iran and Uzbekistan, the metaphor signaled newness, iconoclasm, a casting off of tradition and a rediscovery of latent possibilities. It also contains an implicit threat of obsolescence, since what crests and crashes ashore is also sure to ebb. Which may be one reason for partisans of Romanian cinema to resist the idea of a wave. If no one wins a prize next year in Cannes, will this golden age be over?
 But it's hard, all the same, for an outsider to give full credence to the notion that the current flowering of Romanian film is entirely a matter of happenstance, the serendipitous convergence of a bunch of idiosyncratic talents. For one thing, to watch recent Romanian movies -- the features and the shorts, the festival prizewinners and those that might or should have been -- is to discover a good deal of continuity and overlap in addition to obvious differences. 
 Though they might be reluctant to admit it, the new Romanian filmmakers have a lot in common beyond their reliance on a small pool of acting and technical talent. Because of the stylistic elements they share -- a penchant for long takes and fixed camera positions; a taste for plain lighting and everyday decor; a preference for stories set amid ordinary life -- Puiu, Porumboiu and Mungiu are sometimes described as minimalists or neo-neorealists. But while their work does show some affinity with that of other contemporary European auteurs, like the Belgian brothers Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne, who make art out of the grim facts of quotidian existence, the realism of the Romanians has some distinct characteristics of its own. 
 It seems like something more than coincidence, for example, that the five features that might constitute a mini-canon of 21st-century Romanian cinema -- ''Stuff and Dough,'' Puiu's first feature; ''The Death of Mr. Lazarescu''; ''12:08 East of Bucharest''; ''The Paper Will Be Blue,'' by Radu Muntean; and ''4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days'' -- all confine their action to a single day and focus on a single action. This is less a matter of Aristotelian discipline than of respect for the contingency and loose-endedness of real experience. In each case, the action is completed -- Lazarescu dies; the abortion in ''4 Months'' is performed; the broadcast in ''12:08'' comes to an end -- but a lingering, haunting sense of inconclusiveness remains. The narratives have a shape, but they seem less like plots abstracted from life than like segments carved out of its rough rhythms. The characters are often in a state of restless, agitated motion, confused about where they are going and what they will find when they arrive. The camera follows them into ambulances, streetcars, armored vehicles and minivans, communicating with unsettling immediacy their anxiety and disorientation. The viewer is denied the luxury of distance. After a while, you feel you are living inside these movies as much as watching them. 
 When Otilia, the heroine of ''4 Months,'' joins a dinner party at her boyfriend's house, the camera stays across the table from her, putting the audience in the position of a silent, watchful guest. We know she has just been through an unspeakably strange and awful experience, but the others, friends of the boyfriend's parents, are oblivious, and their banal, posturing wisdom becomes excruciating. The emptiness of authority -- whether generational, political or conferred by elevated social status -- is an unmistakable theme in the work of nearly all the younger Romanian filmmakers. The doctors who neglect Mr. Lazarescu; the grandiose, small-time television host in ''12:08''; the swaggering army commanders and rebel leaders in ''The Paper Will Be Blue'' and their successors, the officious bureaucrats in ''California Dreamin' '' -- all of these men (and they are all men) display a self-importance that is both absurd and malignant. Their hold on power is mitigated sometimes by their own clumsiness but more often by unheralded, stubborn acts of ordinary decency. An ambulance technician decides to help out a suffering old man who is neither kin nor especially kind; a student stands stoically by her irresponsible friend; a militia officer, in the middle of a revolution, goes out of his way to find and protect an errant, idealistic young man under his command.
 There is almost no didacticism or point-making in these films, none of whose characters are easily sorted into good guys and bad guys. Instead, there is an almost palpable impulse to tell the truth, to present choices, conflicts and accidents without exaggeration or omission. This is a form of realism, of course, but its motivation seems to be as much ethical as aesthetic, less a matter of verisimilitude than of honesty. There is an unmistakable political dimension to this kind of storytelling, even when the stories themselves seem to have no overt political content. During the Ceausescu era, which ended abruptly, violently and somewhat ambiguously in December 1989 -- in the last and least velvety of the revolutions of that year -- Romanian public life was dominated by fantasies, delusions and lies. And the filmmakers who were able to work in such conditions resorted, like artists in other communist countries, to various forms of allegory and indirection. Both Puiu and Mungiu describe this earlier mode of Romanian cinema as ''metaphorical,'' and both utter the word with a heavy inflection of disgust. 
 ''I wanted to become a filmmaker as a reaction to that kind of cinema,'' Mungiu told me. ''Nothing like this ever happened in real life. And you got this desire to say: 'People, you don't know what you're talking about. This is all fake. This is not what you should be telling in films. I could do way better than you.' I felt this way, but I think this whole generation had that feeling. Those movies were badly acted, completely unbelievable, with stupid situations, lots of metaphors. It was a time when, you know, saying something about the system was more important than telling a story.''
 The new generation finds itself with no shortage of stories to tell, whether about the traumas of the Stalinist past or the confusions of the Euro-consumerist present -- and also, for the moment, with an audience eager to hear them.
 TALES FROM THE GOLDEN AGE
 Or perhaps with several different audiences. ''Make sure you pay attention to the words on the screen at the beginning,'' Mungiu advised a packed house of moviegoers who had come, six months after Cannes, to see ''4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days.'' This was in Silver Spring, Md., at a program of new European movies presented by the American Film Institute. I saw Mungiu in Cannes in May and met him briefly at the New York Film Festival, but as it happened I would be unable to catch him in Bucharest. After his triumphant homecoming and a kind of roadshow Romanian release of ''4 Months'' over the summer, he had been in a state of frequent-flier exile familiar to successful filmmakers, crisscrossing the globe -- with stops in Korea, Berlin, Los Angeles and now the suburbs of Washington -- to show his movie. 
 His opening remarks were meant to direct the audience's attention to the only part of ''4 Months'' that provides its story with explicit context, a note in the lower right-hand corner that says, ''Romania, 1987.'' But for this crowd, it turned out, the explanation was redundant. They knew exactly where they were. Two-thirds of the way through the screening -- at a point when the viewer is fully immersed in the helplessness and dread that are the film's governing emotions -- I bumped into Mungiu just outside the theater doors. He appeared to be listening intently to what was going on inside. ''I think there are a lot of Romanians here tonight,'' he said, looking up. I asked what gave him that impression. ''They're laughing,'' he said. ''They always do.''
 Now, it should be noted that ''4 Months'' is about as far from a comedy as a movie can be. If you were looking for a generic label, you could do worse than to call it a kind of horror movie, in which the two main characters, young women in jeopardy, are subjected to the sadism of an unscrupulous abortionist and, almost worse, the indifference, hostility and incomprehension of just about everyone else. It is not an easy film to watch, but it feels, to a non-Romanian, like an absolutely convincing anatomy of what ordinary people endured under communism. And it clearly felt that way to the members of the Romanian diaspora as well, except that they found humor in addition to horror in revisiting a familiar bygone world. What followed the screening was less the anticipated Q-and-A session than a trip down memory lane, which spilled out into the theater lobby and continued well into the night. ''That was exactly like my dorm room at university,'' one woman announced. Another wanted to know how Mungiu found the brands of soap, gum and other items that had been staples of the Ceausescu era. (''You can find anything on the Internet,'' he replied.) 
 Mungiu originally conceived ''4 Months,'' which is based on something that happened to a woman he knows, as part of a series of ''Tales From the Golden Age,'' an ironic reference to the way Ceausescu characterized his reign, which began in 1965. Born in 1968, Mungiu calls himself a ''child of the decree,'' meaning Ceausescu's 1966 edict restricting abortion and birth control for the purpose of spurring economic development by increasing the Romanian population. Though the law fell short of its demographic goals, it did in its way spawn a handful of new Romanian filmmakers, who reached adolescence and early adulthood just as Ceausescu's monstrous utopian experiment was collapsing. Puiu was born in 1967. Muntean, whose experience in the military during the 1989 revolution is the basis of ''The Paper Will Be Blue,'' is four years younger. Corneliu Porumboiu was 14 (and playing table tennis with a friend) when the old regime fell.
 Its demise was an anomaly, much as the regime itself was. One especially painful aspect of Romanian communism was that it was, well, Romanian -- an indigenous outgrowth at least as much as a foreign imposition. For much of his reign, Ceausescu was admired in the West for his relative independence from Moscow, but internally he fostered a nationalist cult of personality that in some ways had more in common with Kim Il Sung's North Korea (which Ceausescu came to admire after visiting in the early 1970s) than with desultory bureaucratic police states like Czechoslovakia and East Germany. And perhaps for this reason -- because Romanians were not simply throwing off an imperial yoke, but at the same time exorcising a leader who claimed to be the highest incarnation of their identity as a people -- the Romanian revolution was by far the most violent in Eastern Europe in 1989. Elsewhere, the imagery of that year consists of hammers chipping at the Berlin Wall and a playwright installed in Prague Castle, but in Romania there are soldiers firing into crowds, torn flags and the summary execution, on Christmas Day, of the dictator and his wife. And the nature of the event is shadowed, to this day, by doubt and irresolution. Was it a popular uprising or a coup d'etat sponsored by an opportunistic faction within the military and the ruling party? Its aftermath -- in particular the violent suppression of pro-democracy demonstrations in June 1990 -- was nearly as bloody as the revolution itself, and the transition out of communism in the 1990s was marked by economic crisis, political stalemate and social malaise.
 It would be an unwarranted generalization for me to claim that Romanians are still preoccupied with this history. I can say, though, that every conversation I had in Bucharest, even the most casual, circled back to the old days, so that I sometimes felt that they ended much more recently than 18 years ago. And the physical aspect of Bucharest confirms this impression. The busy shopping streets have the usual storefronts -- Sephora, Hugo Boss, various cellphone carriers and European grocery chains -- and the main north-south road out of town is jammed with Land Rovers and lined with big-box discount stores. Turn a corner, though, or glance behind one of the billboards mounted on the walls of old buildings, and you are thrown backward, from the shiny new age of the European Union (which Romania joined only last year) into the rustiest days of the Iron Curtain. The architecture is a jumble of late-19th-century Hapsburg-style villas and gray socialist apartment blocks, some showing signs of renovation, others looking as if they had fallen under the protection of some mad Warsaw Pact preservation society. 
 This layering of the old and the new was perhaps most apparent when I visited Bucharest's National University of Drama and Film (U.N.A.T.C.), a venerable institution housed in a building rumored to have been previously used as a training facility for the Securitate, Ceausescu's notorious secret police. Mungiu, Porumboiu and Nemescu are all U.N.A.T.C. graduates, and Puiu currently teaches courses there in screen acting. Like much else in the city, the complex was under renovation, with freshly painted walls and tools banging and buzzing in the corridors and courtyards. In a drafty classroom downstairs, I was introduced to members of the faculty, who sat silently and warily, arms folded, as, with the help of an interpreter, I fumbled through an explanation of my interest in new Romanian film. It was not an interest any of them gave much indication of sharing, apart from one voluble professor. ''We are all dinosaurs, but at least I will admit that I am one,'' he announced, before going on to praise the achievements of his former students.
 Afterward, feeling as if I had just failed an oral exam, I went upstairs to meet with some current students -- about 40 of them, crowded into a small screening room. The difference between them and their professors seemed to be more than just a matter of age and status. They belonged to a different world, one in which I felt perfectly at home. I wanted to talk about Romanian cinema, and while they had a lot to say about the subject, they also wanted to talk about Borat and David Lynch, about Sundance and the Oscars, about Japanese anime and ''Hedwig and the Angry Inch.'' 
 Fost sau n-a fost? You tell me. 
 CALIFORNIA DREAMIN'
 ''There is no Romanian film industry.'' This is not another one of Cristi Puiu's counterintuitive provocations but rather a statement I was to hear again and again in Bucharest as I visited the offices of film schools and production companies, a studio back lot and the headquarters of the National Center for Cinematography (C.N.C.). There was no shortage of industriousness, but Romania lacks the basic infrastructure that makes the cycle of production, distribution and exhibition viable in other countries. What is missing, above all, is movie theaters: there are around 80 cinemas serving a country of 22 million people, and 7 of the 42 largest municipalities have no movie screens at all. (In the United States there are almost 40,000 screens and millions of movie fans who still complain that there is nothing to see). 
 What Romania does have, in addition to a backlog of stories crying out to be told on screen, are traditions and institutions that give filmmakers at least some of the tools required to tell them. The ''dinosaurs'' at U.N.A.T.C. take their pupils through a rigorous program of instruction that includes courses in aesthetics and art history and requires them to make two 35-millimeter short films before graduating, one of them in black and white. This kind of old-school technical training, which extends to acting as well, surely accounts for some of the sophistication and self-assurance that Mungiu, Porumboiu and their colleagues display. 
 Not that anything comes easily. The shortage of screens means that the potential for domestic commercial returns is small, and therefore it is hard to attract substantial private investment, either from within Romania or from outside the country. And the scarcity of theaters makes exhibition quotas -- which other countries use to protect their film industries from being overwhelmed by Hollywood -- untenable. But if there is no film industry, there is at least a Law of Cinematography (modeled on a French statute) that establishes a mechanism by which the state helps finance movie production. Taxes collected on television advertising revenue, DVD sales and other media-related transactions go into a fund, money from which is distributed in a twice-yearly competition. Winning projects are ranked, with the top selections receiving as much as 50 percent of their production costs from the fund. Film costs tend to be modest -- the budget of ''4 Months'' was around 700,000 euros -- and the filmmakers have 10 years to pay back the state's investment, at which point they own the film outright. 
 Many of the filmmakers I spoke to complained about the system. Porumboiu, impatient with its slow pace and bureaucratic obstacles, financed ''12:08'' himself. Shortly before Cannes last year, Mungiu was involved in a public spat with the C.N.C. that made headlines in the local press. After a dispute with the center, Puiu circulated a letter pledging never to participate in the system again. 
 But a collection of the movies that arose from harmonious relations between filmmakers and their financiers would consist largely of home videos and vanity projects. Even frustrated artists, in other words, can flourish. And their success abroad, moreover, feeds the system with prestige and helps bring in money from the European Union and adventurous foreign investors. 
 Though Romania's homegrown film industry will most likely remain small, it exists in close proximity to Hollywood itself. American audiences may not be familiar with ''The Paper Will Be Blue'' or ''Stuff and Dough,'' but those who have seen ''Cold Mountain,'' ''Borat'' or ''Seed of Chucky'' can claim some acquaintance with Romanian cinema, or at least with movies made in Romania. About 20 miles outside of Bucharest, where newly built suburban developments give way to farmland, is the Castel Film Studio, a vast complex that houses the largest soundstage in Europe, a 200,000-gallon tank for underwater filming and standing sets like city streets, a full-size wingless jet and the mountain hamlet from ''Cold Mountain.''
 Castel promises skilled labor at a lower cost than producers are likely to find in the United States or Western Europe (though the weakness of the dollar has made its prices a bit less attractive to Americans). Its crews are trained at the rigorous Romanian film schools, and in turn receive hands-on experience with equipment that is hard to come by in modest Romanian productions. Oleg Mutu, the director of photography who brought Bucharest to gloomy life in ''Mr. Lazarescu'' and ''4 Months,'' spent a few weeks operating a camera on ''Cold Mountain.'' Cristi Puiu recently shot an insurance commercial at Castel. The U.N.A.T.C. students, even as they dream of Golden Palms and envision making tough, realistic movies about immigrants, Gypsies and alienated youth, acknowledge that they are more likely to find paying work in advertising or television. 
 Meanwhile, the stars of the current wave -- who are part of what is to my mind the most exciting development in a European national cinema since Spain in the 1980s -- contemplate their next projects and prepare their proposals for the next round of C.N.C. competitions. One afternoon in Bucharest, Corneliu Porumboiu and I sat in the cafe at the Bucharest Cinematheque, drinking coffee and talking about movies: Woody Allen; ''The Lives of Others''; the Italian neorealists. The Cinematheque is a kind of mothership for Bucharest cineastes. It's where they went to discover exotic films when they were younger, and where their films are now shown and celebrated in a country without many other public places for movie going. 
 After a while, we got up, and Porumboiu offered to show me around the screening rooms. At the box-office entrance, decorated with a ''4 Months, 3 Weeks and Two Days'' flier, a guard confronted us and shooed us away. The facilities were closed. Porumboiu tried to explain that he wanted to show them to a guest from New York, but he was rebuffed. We could buy a ticket or rent out a theater, but we couldn't just walk in and look around. And so we wandered away, to find another place to hang out in this bustling, bedraggled city. It occurred to me that maybe there was no Romanian translation of the sentence ''Do you know who I am?'' -- which would have been the first thing out of an American director's mouth in a similar situation. Or perhaps this was a double-edged metaphor: maybe in Bucharest, nowadays, a filmmaker with a prize from Cannes is nothing special.

 BODY:
The Case of the Red-Cockaded Woodpecker
 One year from today, a new president moves into the White House. This president will be eager to carry out any number of plans -- including, surely, plans to help the segments of society that most need help. Extending a helping hand, after all, is one of the great privileges and responsibilities of the presidency.
 But before charging ahead with such plans, the new president might do well to first ask him- or herself the following question: What do a deaf woman in Los Angeles, a first-century Jewish sandal maker and a red-cockaded woodpecker have in common? 
 A few months ago, a prospective patient called the office of Andrew Brooks, a top-ranked orthopedic surgeon in Los Angeles. She was having serious knee trouble, and she was also deaf. She wanted to know if her deafness posed a problem for Brooks. He had his assistant relay a message: no, of course not; he could easily discuss her situation using knee models, anatomical charts and written notes. 
 The woman later called again to say she would rather have a sign-language interpreter. Fine, Brooks said, and asked his assistant to make the arrangements. As it turned out, an interpreter would cost $120 an hour, with a two-hour minimum, and the expense wasn't covered by insurance. Brooks didn't think it made sense for him to pay. That would mean laying out $240 to conduct an exam for which the woman's insurance company would pay him $58 -- a loss of more than $180 even before accounting for taxes and overhead.
 So Brooks suggested to the patient that they make do without the interpreter. That's when she told him that the Americans With Disabilities Act (A.D.A.) allowed a patient to choose the mode of interpretation, at the physician's expense. Brooks, flabbergasted, researched the law and found that he was indeed obliged to do as the patient asked -- unless, that is, he wanted to invite a lawsuit that he would probably lose.
 If he ultimately operated on the woman's knee, Brooks would be paid roughly $1,200. But he would also then need to see her for eight follow-up visits, presumably with the $240 interpreter each time. By the end of the patient's treatment, Brooks would be solidly in the red.
 He went ahead and examined the woman, paying the interpreter out of his pocket. As it turned out, she didn't need surgery; her knee could be treated through physical therapy. This was a fortunate outcome for everyone involved -- except, perhaps, for the physical therapist who would have to pay the interpreter's bills.
 Brooks told several colleagues and doctor friends about his deaf patient. ''They all said, 'If I ever get a call from someone like that, I'll never see her,' '' he says. This led him to wonder if the A.D.A. had a dark side. ''It's got to be widely pervasive and probably not talked about, because doctors are just getting squeezed further and further. This kind of patient will end up getting passed on and passed on, getting the runaround, not understanding why she's not getting good care.''
 So does the A.D.A. in some cases hurt the very patients it is intended to help? That's a hard question to answer with the available medical data. But the economists Daron Acemoglu and Joshua Angrist once asked a similar question: How did the A.D.A. affect employment among the disabled?
 Their conclusion was rather startling and makes Andrew Brooks's hunch ring true. Acemoglu and Angrist found that when the A.D.A. was enacted in 1992, it led to a sharp drop in the employment of disabled workers. How could this be? Employers, concerned that they wouldn't be able to discipline or fire disabled workers who happened to be incompetent, apparently avoided hiring them in the first place.
 How long have such do-good laws been backfiring? Consider the ancient Jewish laws concerning the sabbatical, or seventh year. As commanded in the Bible, all Jewish-owned lands in Israel were to lie fallow every seventh year, with the needy allowed to gather whatever food continued to grow. Even more significant, all loans were to be forgiven in the sabbatical. The appeal of such unilateral debt relief cannot be overestimated, since the penalties for defaulting on a loan at the time were severe: a creditor could go so far as to take a debtor or his children into bondage.
 So for a poor Jewish sandal maker having trouble with his loan payments, the sabbatical law was truly a godsend. If you were a creditor, however, you saw things differently. Why should you lend the sandal maker money if he could just tear up the loan in Year Seven? Creditors duly gamed the system, making loans in the years right after a sabbatical, when they were confident they would be repaid, but then pulling tight the purse strings in Years Five and Six. The resulting credit drought was so damaging to poor people that it fell to the great sage Hillel to fix things.
 His solution, known as prosbul, allowed a lender to go to court and pre-emptively declare that a specific loan would not be subject to sabbatical debt relief, transferring the debt to the court itself and thereby empowering it to collect the loan. This left the law technically intact but allowed for lenders to once again make credit available to the poor without taking on unwarranted risk for themselves.
 The fallow-land portion of the sabbatical law, meanwhile, was upheld for centuries, but it, too, finally gained a loophole, called heter mechira. This allowed for a Jew to temporarily ''sell'' his land to a non-Jew and to continue farming it during the sabbatical year and then ''buy'' it back immediately afterward -- a solution that helped the modern state of Israel keep its agricultural economy humming.
 The trouble is that many of the most observant Israeli Jews reject this maneuver as a sleight of hand that violates the spirit of the law. Many of these traditionalists are also extremely poor. And so this year, which happens to be a sabbatical year, the poorest Jews in Israel who wish to eat only food grown on non-Jewish land are left to buy imported goods at double or triple the regular price -- all in order to uphold a law meant to help feed the poorest Jews in Israel.
 Such well-meaning laws surely don't end up harming animals as well, do they?
 Consider the Endangered Species Act (E.S.A.) of 1973, which protects flora and fauna as well as their physical habitats. The economists Dean Lueck and Jeffrey Michael wanted to gauge the E.S.A.'s effect on the red-cockaded woodpecker, a protected bird that nests in old-growth pine trees in eastern North Carolina. By examining the timber harvest activity of more than 1,000 privately owned forest plots, Lueck and Michael found a clear pattern: when a landowner felt that his property was turning into the sort of habitat that might attract a nesting pair of woodpeckers, he rushed in to cut down the trees. It didn't matter if timber prices were low.
 This happened less than two years ago in Boiling Spring Lakes, N.C. ''Along the roadsides,'' an A.P. article reported, ''scattered brown bark is all that's left of once majestic pine stands.'' As sad as this may be, it isn't surprising to anyone who has examined the perverse incentives created by the E.S.A. In their paper, Lueck and Michael cite a 1996 developers' guide from the National Association of Home Builders: ''The highest level of assurance that a property owner will not face an E.S.A. issue is to maintain the property in a condition such that protected species cannot occupy the property.''
 One notable wrinkle of the E.S.A. is that a species is often declared endangered months or even years before its ''critical habitats'' are officially designated. This allows time for developers, environmentalists and everyone in between to have their say at public hearings. What happens during that lag time? 
 In a new working paper that examines the plight of the cactus ferruginous pygmy owl, the economists John List, Michael Margolis and Daniel Osgood found that landowners near Tucson rushed to clear their property for development rather than risk having it declared a safe haven for the owl. The economists make the argument for ''the distinct possibility that the Endangered Species Act is actually endangering, rather than protecting, species.''
 So does this mean that every law designed to help endangered animals, poor people and the disabled is bound to fail? Of course not. But with a government that is regularly begged for relief -- these days, from mortgage woes, health-care costs and tax burdens -- and with every presidential hopeful making daily promises to address these woes, it might be worth encouraging the winning candidate to think twice (or even 8 or 10 times) before rushing off to do good. Because if there is any law more powerful than the ones constructed in a place like Washington, it is the law of unintended consequences.

HEADLINE: The Construction Site Called Saudi Arabia

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

DATELINE: RABIGH, Saudi Arabia 

 BODY:
-- THE alarm bell sounded the end of the lunch break here one November afternoon, and suddenly thousands of workers -- on foot, on bicycles and in buses -- streamed in, seemingly from out of nowhere, and jolted this huge construction site to life.
 Amid a forest of cranes, towers and beams rising from the desert, more than 38,000 workers from China, India, Turkey and beyond have been toiling for two years in unforgiving conditions -- often in temperatures exceeding 100 degrees -- to complete one of the world's largest petrochemical plants in record time. 
 By the end of the year, this massive city of steel at the edge of the Red Sea will take its place as a cog of globalization: plastics produced here will be used to make televisions in Japan, cellphones in China and thousands of other products to be sold in the United States and Europe. Construction costs at the plant, which spreads over eight square miles, have doubled to $10 billion because of shortages in materials and labor. The amount of steel being used is 10 times the weight of the Eiffel Tower. 
 ''I've worked on many big things in my life, but I've never worked on anything this big,'' an American project manager mused during a bus tour of the project, called Petro Rabigh, a joint venture of the state-run oil company Saudi Aramco and Sumitomo Chemical of Japan. 
 Size isn't the only consideration. The project is Saudi Arabia's boldest bet yet that this oil-rich kingdom can transform itself into an industrial powerhouse. The plant is part of a $500 billion investment program to build new cities, create millions of jobs and diversify the economy away from petroleum exports over the next two decades.
 ''The Saudi economy was in idle mode for 20 years,'' said John Sfakianakis, the chief economist at SABB, formerly known as the Saudi British Bank, who is based in Riyadh, the Saudi capital. ''Today, the feeling here is, 'We've won the lottery; let's not waste it.'<0>''
 The kingdom's lofty economic goals would have been unthinkable without the surge in energy prices that has filled the coffers of oil producers. Oil prices have quadrupled since 2002 and reached $100 a barrel in New York this month. 
 Persian Gulf countries earned $1.5 trillion in oil revenue from 2002 to 2006, twice as much as in the previous five-year period, according to the Institute of International Finance, a global association of banks that is based in Washington. As the top exporter, Saudi Arabia has been the main beneficiary.
 Despite all the recent headlines about Middle East investors bailing out troubled American banks like Citigroup, a growing share of today's petrodollars are staying at home to finance megaprojects like Petro Rabigh, analysts say. That money is financing the biggest economic boom in a generation, helping to build not only the high-rises of Dubai, where the world's tallest tower is going up, but also telecommunications networks, roads and universities throughout the Middle East. 
 Abu Dhabi is planning to spend close to $1 billion for a new museum with the help of the Louvre, in Paris. Dubai's latest grandiose idea is to build a small-scale replica of the French city of Lyon, complete with residential housing, a museum, a culinary school and a soccer club.
 In Saudi Arabia, Riyadh looks like a boom town: sprawling over 40 miles, it is teeming with shopping malls, electronics stores and luxury boutiques. But while times are good today, many Saudis realize that their country is locked in a race against time to create industries that produce more than just oil in order to keep a young and growing population employed. The kingdom, which has a population of 24.5 million, including nearly 7 million foreigners, has what one analyst called a ''human time bomb.'' About 40 percent of Saudis are under 15, and because the country has one of the world's highest birth rates, the population is expected to reach nearly 40 million by 2025. 
 ''It has been a social, and therefore a political, imperative of the Saudi government to develop the economy and to create employment opportunities,'' said Timothy S. Gray, the chief executive of HSBC Saudi Arabia.
 That could well mean that higher oil prices are here to stay. One paradox of modern-day Saudi Arabia is that while it seeks to reduce the importance of petroleum to its economy, it needs those exports more than ever.
 TO be sure, the region's economies are too small to absorb all the oil riches on their own. Too much money is chasing too few assets, analysts say, forcing oil producers to invest some of their revenue abroad and diversify their holdings, either through opaque state-owned investment funds or through direct private investments. 
 Last year, for example, a fund controlled by the government of Abu Dhabi bought a stake in Citigroup for $7.5 billion, while another run by Dubai's ruler bought a large share in Sony, the Japanese consumer electronics giant. Sabic, a major Saudi petrochemical company, bought the plastics division of General Electric for $11.6 billion, and the Kuwait Petroleum Corporation bought half of Dow Chemical's commodity-plastics unit for $9.5 billion. 
 In recent weeks, other big banks plagued by losses from the mortgage crisis, like Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley, have raised tens of billions of dollars from a variety of Middle Eastern and Asian funds, including ones from Kuwait or Saudi Arabia.
 According to data compiled by Bloomberg News, overseas investments by Persian Gulf countries reached a record $75 billion in 2007. Arms deals, a time-worn way of recycling petrodollars, remain popular in the region; the United States is pushing for a $20 billion weapons sale to Saudi Arabia, for example. But while oil-rich states are still buying American Treasury bonds or military hardware from the West, analysts say the more significant trend is for a growing share of their investments to be pumped into local projects. 
 ''The vision is to turn the kingdom into a major industrial power by 2020,'' said Jean-Francois Seznec, a professor at Georgetown University who is a specialist in industrial policies in the Persian Gulf. ''A billion dollars here and a billion there, and soon you're talking about real money.''
 Projects like Petro Rabigh, Mr. Seznec said, will allow Saudi Arabia to become one of the top three chemical producers in the world within a few years. Unlike Kuwait or Abu Dhabi, Saudi Arabia does not have a sovereign fund responsible for investing the country's petroleum riches. 
 Ali Al-Naimi, the kingdom's energy minister and one of the grand architects of Saudi industrial policy, summed up the country's goals at the dedication ceremony for Petro Rabigh in 2006.
 ''I would like to highlight the fact that the Petro Rabigh project is part of a bigger picture,'' Mr. Naimi said at the time. ''This strategy includes expanding the base of the Saudi economy, diversifying national income sources, attracting international investments and reaping the direct and indirect benefits that these types of projects will accrue to the Saudi citizen.'' 
 The trend to modernize and develop the economy is not entirely new, of course. Saudi Arabia has been trying to diversify itself for over two decades. It famously tried to make the desert bloom in the 1970s and '80s by investing heavily in water desalinization plants and growing crops. 
 But a long period of low oil prices, from the mid-1980s through the 1990s, stalled much of its effort. The government still relies on petroleum exports for 90 percent of its revenue; oil sales account for half of the country's gross domestic product. 
 The current level of oil prices has given the country's industrialization strategy a new spring, allowing the government to improve its finances while investing in large infrastructure projects. The Saudi G.D.P. has doubled in the last five years. Not counting oil, economic growth has been 4 percent to 6 percent a year since 2002. 
 Oil has not been the only engine of growth. The country's private sector has also thrived and now accounts for 45 percent of the economy, compared with just 20 percent about 20 years ago. Since the 1990s, the share of private Saudi money invested at home has doubled, and now represents about 20 percent of total holdings, according to SABB.
 ''There is a lot of money looking for investment opportunities,'' said Mr. Gray at HSBC.
 The financial turnaround has been spectacular. In 1999, the Saudi government's debt amounted to 120 percent of G.D.P. That number has dropped to less than 20 percent as the government paid back its obligations and put its finances in order.
 Last year, the government recorded a budget surplus of $48 billion, five times the surplus of 2003. This year, it has built its biggest budget to date around a conservative estimate of oil prices of $45 a barrel; that will almost certainly yield a substantial surplus at the end of the year. 
 All of that is a far cry from the 1990s, when oil averaged $20 a barrel, thanks mostly to Saudi concerns at the time to keep oil prices low. 
 One of the most noticeable illustrations of the industrialization push is a plan championed by King Abdullah, the 83-year-old Saudi monarch, to build six new cities throughout the country -- including the King Abdullah Economic City on the western coast, near the city of Rabigh; the Knowledge Economic City, near Medina; and the Prince Abdulaziz bin Mousaed Economic City, in the north. 
 The intent is to create industrial centers that double as housing and commercial hubs for the country's young and growing population. The Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority, a government agency, expects these cities to add $150 billion to the country's G.D.P. by 2020, create one million new jobs and be home to as many as five million people. 
 Drawings of these new towns depict a cross of the futuristic ''Blade Runner'' and traditional Arabic design. But the new cities are also expected to become new industrial centers that focus on four main sectors: petrochemicals, aluminum, steel and fertilizers. 
 According to SABB, these cities together will have four times the geographical area of Hong Kong, three times the population of Dubai, and an economic output equal to Singapore's. Other plans include building four refineries, two petrochemical plants and a modern graduate-level university with an endowment of $10 billion. 
 THE frenzied growth of the economy has had some serious downsides. Inflation has been rampant in the last year; food prices and rents have risen sharply. Traffic jams in Riyadh and other Saudi cities have become a constant affliction, while real estate values have soared and the construction sector is strained by a lack of workers. 
 The stock market, meanwhile, has yet to recover from its collapse two years ago. From 2000 to early 2006, the local Tadawul stock index surged from 2,000 points to a peak of 19,870, a return of almost 900 percent. But the overvalued market went into a panicky free fall that caused it to lose two-thirds of its value in a matter of months.
 After being flat for most of 2007, the market has recovered in the last quarter, gaining more than 40 percent. Still, its value is only about half that of its peak two years ago.
 One reason for the partial rebound was anticipation of the sale of shares in Petro Rabigh earlier this month. For the first time, Saudi investors had a chance to buy a major asset linked to Aramco. The initial public offering, for 25 percent of Petro Rabigh, raised $1.23 billion and was the largest stock sale in Saudi history. The stock is expected to begin trading at the end of the month. 
 The project itself is still about a year away from completion. Once in operation, it will produce 2.4 million tons of plastics a year. This venture, along with dozens of other megaprojects, will firmly anchor Saudi Arabia as one of the world's top suppliers of chemical products as well as oil.
 ''Saudi Aramco has a vision of itself as Exxon Mobil,'' Mr. Seznec of Georgetown said, ''except much bigger.''

HEADLINE: Democratic Vistas

BYLINE: By JANINE DI GIOVANNI. 
Janine di Giovanni is the author of ''Madness Visible: A Memoir of War.''

 BODY:
THE SPIRIT OF DEMOCRACY 
 The Struggle to Build Free Societies Throughout the World. 
 By Larry Diamond. 
 448 pp. Times Books/Henry Holt & Company. $28. 
 H. L. Mencken once wrote that ''democracy is only a dream: it should be put in the same category as Arcadia, Santa Claus and Heaven.''
 Reading through Larry Diamond's dense study of the global quest for democracy, one reckons Mencken may have been right. It's painfully obvious that many countries have gone cruelly backward in the past decade -- Vladimir Putin's Russia, for example, or Robert Mugabe's Zimbabwe or Pervez Musharraf's Pakistan. 
 Diamond is a meticulous social scientist who, in ''Squandered Victory,'' took on the task of studying America's bungled effort to bring democracy to Iraq. ''The Spirit of Democracy'' takes on the world, with Diamond leaping from Malawi to Singapore to Venezuela. He looks at countries that broke down after the post-1974 ''third wave'' of democracy and have yet to recover, not only obvious examples like corruption-ridden Nigeria, but also Nepal, Thailand and the Solomon Islands. He studies what he calls ''the pathology of personal rule'' in Africa, along with the role of monarchy, populism and Islam in the Middle East. One might easily assume from such a discouraging survey that ''The Spirit of Democracy'' is a gigantic downer. In fact, Diamond is anything but pessimistic: he believes that most of the world, one way or another, can move toward democracy. 
 ''By the mid-1990s,'' he writes, ''it had become clear to me, as it had to many of my colleagues involved in the global struggle for democracy, that if some three-fifths of the world's states (many of them poor and non-Western) could become democracies, there was no intrinsic reason why the rest of the world could not do as well.'' He even throws countries like China and Iran into this equation.
 Diamond can be optimistic because he compares the present, with all of its setbacks, to 1974, when he was a student leader during the protests against the Vietnam War. In those days, he reminds us, democracy was not the way of the world. ''Barely a quarter of independent states chose their governments through competitive, free and fair elections.'' 
 There were Marxist and nationalist insurgencies in Asia and Africa. Haile Selassie was soon to fall in Ethiopia, which, Diamond notes, would leave ''almost all of sub-Saharan Africa ... under military or one-party rule.''
 There was repressive military rule in Latin America, including Chile, where the military had overthrown the democratically elected Allende government. Totalitarianism had the Soviet Union and the Eastern European satellite states in a vise-like grip. Elsewhere, havoc prevailed. The Khmer Rouge would soon take over in Cambodia and ultimately be responsible for the death of an estimated one to two million people (out of a total population of seven million). In the Arab world, only Lebanon was a democracy. 
 The American government, meanwhile, was obsessed with the cold-war struggle against Communist expansion and was disengaging from a war in Southeast Asia that had cost the lives of 58,000 of its citizens, as well as several million Vietnamese.
 At that time, Diamond set out on a journey to see where changes were occurring, for good and bad. His first stop was Portugal. A few months earlier, the Movement of the Armed Forces had overthrown a nearly 50-year dictatorship; that is, a military coup had overthrown a quasi-fascist dictatorship. Diamond watched as Communist and other political forces tried to thrash out a new government. 
 Then he moved south to Nigeria, Africa's biggest and most promising democracy. It was, however, ''a country in an economic and political fever,'' flush with oil but broken down from the brutal Biafran conflict.
 From Africa, Diamond went on to the Middle East, to Egypt and Israel, each emerging from the trauma of the 1973 war. Next it was Thailand, ''trying to find its footing,'' and Taiwan, which he calls ''one of the key authoritarian states in the East Asian miracle.''
 In a sense, that expansive journey inspired Diamond's life work. What he gleaned from his experience was the theory that the fate of democracy was not driven by historical events or even structural forces but by the passion and zeal of individual people. ''It is a consequence of struggle, strategy, ingenuity, vision, courage,'' he writes, adding that the places where democracy worked took genuine commitment, talent, nerve and the obvious passion for freedom -- ''politics in the best sense of the word.''
 As an example, he cites Serbia's extraordinary ''bulldozer'' revolution in October 2000, in which a democratic alliance of opposition parties, a group of students armed with cellphones and a bunch of farmers riding tractors into Belgrade managed to mobilize a million people for peaceful resistance. They toppled Slobodan Milosevic's iron-fisted rule -- something the inefficient politicians were unable to do throughout a decade of brutal wars and economic breakdown. That peaceful revolution became a model throughout the region, most notably in Georgia and Ukraine. 
 ''The Spirit of Democracy'' asks whether democracy is something that can exist only in rich and educated countries, those with a strong middle class. Do all people actually want democracy, or do some -- the Chinese perhaps -- believe that a form of authoritarianism is the best way to run a country? 
 To answer this question, Diamond examines the forces that contribute to democracy, from the internal influences that give rise to civil societies to the impact of peaceful outside pressures like diplomatic persuasion or, in some cases, economic sanctions. He highlights the work of the National Endowment for Democracy, founded in 1983 to promote democracy abroad, and the democratic assistance it successfully provided to Poland and Nicaragua. 
 Diamond is at his best when he recounts how ordinary people affect the democratic process. He tells us, for instance, about Alejandro Toledo, the former Peruvian leader, who worked his way up from tending sheep and pigs as an ''Indian rebellious of poverty'' to become an ambitious and idealistic president. Toledo's five-year term was not a success politically, but Diamond uses it as a lesson to indicate what might work in Latin America. 
 Interviews with Chinese and African democratic leaders show us idealistic individuals bravely seeking change. Similarly, when Diamond speaks of contemporary Russia, a place where he believes democracy has strikingly receded since the days of Boris Yeltsin, he points to courageous journalists like Anna Politkovskaya, murdered for attempting to write the truth. 
 Oil is a major part of the story of Russia's democratic retreat, as it is for many other nations. None of the 23 countries whose economies are dominated by what Diamond calls ''the exceptional curse of oil'' are democracies. From Algeria to Venezuela, he chillingly reminds us, ''all of the oil-rich countries of the world remained under or returned to authoritarian rule after 1974 and the third wave of democratization.'' When oil revenues surge, he writes, democracy declines.
 Diamond's book is not for everyone. It's overloaded with comparative statistics, World Bank data and ratings from Freedom House. Reading it takes true commitment. But it offers well-grounded support to anyone who has questioned the long-held theory of Seymour Martin Lipset that the richer the country, the greater the chances of sustaining democracy.
 Third world countries are not destined to lurch from dictator to dictator, Diamond insists. Even places like Burundi and Sierra Leone, he points out, became democracies after the brutality and violence of bloody civil wars (although they are vulnerable to risk). Democracy may be a luxury, but it isn't a question of wealth. It all comes down to the energy and commitment of people. Indeed, the message of Diamond's book is summed up by its dedication to three icons of democracy: Gandhi, Vaclav Havel and Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. 
 Diamond makes the hopeful prediction that even ''countries like Iran and China, which now seem so immune to the global democratic trend, stand a very good chance of becoming democratic in the next two to three decades.'' 
 ''And if China can democratize,'' Diamond asks, ''why not the entire world?''

HEADLINE: Work an Hour, Pay Tax on 2. Is That Fair?

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

 BODY:
MORE than a few commuters from Connecticut and New Jersey have dreamed about skipping the daily slog to their office in New York and working at home.
 Unfortunately, this can also turn out to be more costly, thanks to New York's tax code, which in some cases double-taxes nonresidents who work for companies based in New York but occasionally telecommute.
 New York's ''convenience of the employer'' rule taxes nonresidents as if they came to the office every day, even if they worked at home part of the week, unless they can prove their employer required them to telecommute. Yet they must also pay income tax in their home states for work they did there. 
 New York is the only state that aggressively enforces its tax code this way; most states use a ''physical presence'' test that lets workers pay taxes in proportion to the amount of time spent working in each state.
 The rule has critics, because it penalizes some workers from out of state and also dilutes efforts to promote telecommuting that might ease congestion on the highways and trains in the New York City area.
 ''There's tremendous inconsistency that's hard to understand,'' said Edward A. Zelinsky, who lives in New Haven and teaches at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law in Manhattan. ''New York's position is a day working in Connecticut is a day to pay them tax. But with modern word processing, Lexis-Nexis and broadband, I can do research at my kitchen table that 20 years ago I would have had to drive in to the school's library to do.''
 Frustrated by the perceived inequity, Professor Zelinsky unsuccessfully challenged the rule, which the Tax Appeals Tribunal of New York upheld in 2003. Other legal challenges have failed as well.
 ''Regardless of how people feel about the rule, it's been upheld every time,'' said Thomas Bergin, a spokesman for the New York State Department of Tax and Finance.
 That has not prevented others from trying to get rid of the rule. Last year, Senators Christopher J. Dodd and Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut -- with New York in mind -- were sponsors of the Telecommuter Tax Fairness Act, which would ban any state from double-taxing nonresident telecommuters.
 The bill, and its companion in the House of Representatives, sponsored by Christopher Shays of Connecticut and others, is stuck in a subcommittee and unlikely to be passed soon.
 Potentially tens of thousands of nonresidents who work for companies in New York are double-taxed. On an average workday, Metro-North carries 18,000 riders into Grand Central Terminal from Connecticut and an additional 6,000 on its two lines west of the Hudson River, most from New Jersey. Hundreds of thousands of others take other rail lines, buses or cars into New York from neighboring states. 
 While it is hard to find precise numbers for how many nonresidents are double-taxed, of the nearly 1.9 million people who filed tax claims in Connecticut last year, 200,000 filed nonresident forms, said Sarah E. Kaufman, a spokeswoman for the Connecticut Department of Revenue Services.
 But it is unclear how many of them worked in another state or had moved to or from Connecticut in the previous year. It is also unclear how many of these people worked from home and how often. Most important, it is undetermined how many of them worked at home at the behest of their employer, one of the key requirements to receive an exemption from New York.
 For its part, New York justifies the rule out of fairness to its own residents. 
 ''Allowing this taxpayer to allocate his income to Connecticut when he stays home to do his work in connection with his teaching activity would enable him to avoid paying taxes that his colleagues who do that work at home in New York -- or at the law school -- pay,'' Judith S. Kaye, chief judge of New York's Court of Appeals, wrote in her decision to reject Mr. Zelinsky's challenge to the tax rule.
 There is also the potential for employees to try to pay the state tax rate that is lower. Then there is the economic risk that jobs might disappear if telecommuting spreads too quickly. New York City needs a steady stream of workers coming into Manhattan daily to keep offices filled (and property prices high). These workers also spend in local stores, restaurants and theaters.
 ''What makes New York so successful is the density of talent coming into the city,'' said Kathryn Wylde, president and chief executive of the Partnership for New York City, a nonprofit group whose mission is to enhance the city's economy. ''We want them to have a great mass transit system. We don't see how advocating for telecommuting is a benefit to New York.''
 None of this mattered much before 1991, when Connecticut introduced a state income tax. Also, in the last few years, telecommuting has become more feasible, thanks to cheap, reliable broadband and personal computers.
 In some ways, the rule is at odds with New York's plans to build new subways and introduce a congestion pricing strategy to discourage people from driving into the city.
 According to the Partnership for New York City, excess congestion shaves up to $4 billion a year off the region's economy, and as a result 52,000 jobs are not created.
 But given New York's preference for finding more efficient ways to get more commuters into the city, rather than encouraging them to work at home, it seems unlikely the situation will change any time soon, legal experts say.
 ''New York is able to get away with it because it costs money to take on the state,'' said William V. Vetter, a professor of tax and business law at Prairie View A&M University in Texas, who has called New York's tax rule unconstitutional. ''Everyone's out to get money from people who don't vote for them.''

HEADLINE: Save a Therm, Get $2 or Even $2.50

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO

 BODY:
THE settlement of a rate case involving the Consolidated Edison Company and New York State's Public Service Commission could save owners of residential buildings with five or more apartments -- including co-ops and condominiums -- significant amounts of money if they upgrade their heating systems this year. 
 The Gas Efficiency Performance Program, paid for by Con Ed and administered by the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, provides cash incentives for certain natural-gas customers who increase the efficiency of their heating systems. 
 Customers who qualify will receive a check for $2 or $2.50 for every therm they save in a year. (Gas is billed according to how many therms a customer uses. A therm is a unit of gas that produces 100,000 B.T.U.'s of heat, and a large building could use tens of thousands of therms in a month.)
 ''This could be a big deal for owners considering upgrading their system,'' said Mike Colgrove, a senior project manager for the program.
 Market-rate buildings are eligible for the $2 payment. 
 The $2.50 payment per therm saved is available to buildings classified as affordable housing. Mr. Colgrove says the program gives a building this classification if 25 percent or more of its residents earn less than 80 percent of the state's median income, which is currently $41,544 for an individual and $72,100 for a family of four or more.
 Other buildings designated as affordable housing by the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, by the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal or by the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development do not have to meet the income eligibility test. 
 For either type of building to qualify, it must be a Con Edison customer with more than 50 percent of its gross heated square footage dedicated to residential tenants. A building, for example, that is 70 percent commercial and 30 percent residential would not qualify.
 Finally, the building owner must have an engineering survey conducted before and after making an improvement to determine how much energy it will save annually.
 The one-time payment is based on the total estimated annual savings. Possible improvements include installing programmable thermostats, replacing radiator valves or redoing the entire heating plant. 
 Mr. Colgrove pointed out that at present, Con Edison charges about $1 per therm to residential customers and that the potential savings could be significant. ''In larger buildings,'' he said, ''you're usually talking about consumption in the tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of therms a year.'' 
 Applications are available at getenergysmart.org. Click on ''multifamily'' at the top of the page and then on Con Ed Gas Incentives; go to the bottom of the next page and click on the application form. To qualify, you must have the work performed by the end of October. 
 Con Edison distributes natural gas to 1.1 million customers in Manhattan, the Bronx, Queens and Westchester County.

HEADLINE: Adventure Guide To Mexico

BYLINE: By BONNIE TSUI. 
BONNIE TSUI is editor of ''A Leaky Tent Is a Piece of Paradise'' (Sierra Club), a collection of essays on the outdoors.

 BODY:
BEYOND the sunbathers, cervezas and spring break debauchery so conspicuously on display in Cancun and Cozumel, Mexico offers a lesser-known adventure experience -- the kind that is found deep in the jungle or near small fishing villages and offshore reefs. 
 The same country that possesses one of the world's most polluted capital cities also ranks as one of the richest in species diversity. Twenty-two biosphere reserves and nearly 50 national parks offer hiking and wildlife-watching opportunities; mountain chains and interior canyons are chockfull of biking trails; fertile warm-water upwellings attract pods of whales and glittering fish. 
 Adventurous tourists -- particularly those focused on a specific outdoor sport or activity -- have much to discover along the coast and on the country's ruggedly varied interior terrain. 
 Almost by definition, some of these unexplored gems are in remote areas, so travelers will need to be vigilant about safety. That's where knowledgeable outfitters are key -- they can take you to little-touristed places where you'll feel comfortable exploring the backcountry forests and secluded beaches that you might not visit alone. Regions like Chiapas and Oaxaca, while still extricating their reputations from recent political unrest, have become more stable. Before you book, consult the United States State Department (www.travel.state.gov) for travel advisories. 
 SURFING: SAYULITA 
 Surfers have been crossing the border to ride waves along Mexico's Pacific coast for decades, and this small coastal fishing village 30 minutes north of Puerto Vallarta has lately achieved the perfect mix of lively beachfront bars, surf camps and terra-cotta architectural charm -- all, most importantly, with easy access to numerous breaks ideal for beginners and for intermediates looking to sharpen their technique. Advanced riders might head south to the body-wrecking barrels at Puerto Escondido, but the rest of us mere mortals will be content to spend a week or two skimming the waves there.
 An easy right break on Sayulita's bay, just off a curving white-sand stretch of town beach, is where longboarders spend most of their time; if those waves get too big, beginners can always move down the beach and find smaller ones. A faster left break caters to speedy shortboarders. In 2006, the Access Trips adventure travel company started a small-group surf itinerary to Sayulita and its surrounding breaks, joining the pioneering Las Olas Surf Safaris (www.surflasolas.com), which runs surf camps for women, and several others. The special flavor of the village, says Alain Chuard, co-owner of Access Trips, comes from its friendly and eclectic population (local fishermen, hippies, expatriates) and the town's careful control over development (there are no big hotels or big chain stores here, whereas Wal-Mart has landed in Puerto Vallarta).
 Most everything in Sayulita is within walking distance, from the beach to the grocery stores and cafes in the village center to the surrounding jungle. The village might not be a secret anymore, but it's far from being overrun by tourists. Beaches are rarely crowded, a one-bedroom villa at Villa Amor, the luxury hotel in town, starts at $90 a night, and foreign travelers tend to be in their 20s and 30s.
 Access Trips' seven-day surf safaris are led by a local surfer, Javier Chavez, and a core team of instructors. The student-to-teacher ratio is capped at an intimate 4 to 1, and all trip leaders are locals. Days are spent surfing the bay and visiting other secluded surf spots north and south of Sayulita that are accessible only by boat. In the winter, humpback whales cruising by the bay are a bonus. Surfers stay in newly built bungalows with ocean views just up the hill from town, and morning yoga sessions in a private studio help ease the muscle pain left by consecutive pop-ups on the surfboard. Lunch might be grilled shrimp on the beach, and there are plenty of other outdoor activities, including guided jungle treks, mountain biking and trips to hot springs. 
 Access Trips, (650) 492-4778); www.accesstrips.com; seven-day surf adventures from $1,885, including lodging, instruction, all breakfasts, a lunch and two dinners, yoga and transportation, including airport transfers; November through May. 
 ROCK CLIMBING: EL POTRERO CHICO
 About an hour northwest of Monterrey, a craggy limestone outcrop named El Potrero Chico has been quietly attracting rock climbers from around the world. What makes the area unusual is the sheer variety of the 600-plus bolted routes -- in which permanent artificial anchors are embedded in the rock -- all within easy access of a campground and lodge at the base of the rock. 
 The icing on the cake? You won't have to share. The crowd typically tops out at 50 or 60 people, mostly a mix of Americans and Canadians and some Europeans; on many days, you'll probably encounter just a handful of other climbers.
 Since the climbing scene in Mexico has yet to take off, most of the climbs have been developed by Americans in the last decade, and routes are usually christened with quirky Spanish or English names (Estrellita, Treasure of Sierra Madre, Yankee Clipper). The bolting of routes directly into the rock makes the rugged terrain more accessible to a wider spectrum of climbers; an average Joe can easily try a beginner climb next to an awesome Jane working on a longer, more complicated route. Limestone uplift makes for a combination of crags, spires and ridges. The terrain and loose rock conditions are the kind of thing you'd find in the backcountry (think the Wind River range in Wyoming), but here, it's all fixed-bolt sport climbing instead of traditional climbing, in which climbers place their own gear to protect against falls.
 Long, moderate sport routes make El Potrero Chico a friendly place for climbers to work on their skills. Posada El Potrero Chico is a family-run campsite and lodge owned by a local resident named Luis Lozano. It serves the sporting crowd with Wi-Fi, new casitas and a small gear shop. 
 El Potrero Chico is just west of the small town of Hidalgo, where the living is simple, with street markets and hearty food typical of northern Mexico -- nopalitos, carne asada, gorditas. To encourage climbing and environmental efforts in the community, the climbing school runs cleanup days in which local children help with the maintenance of routes by collecting trash. 
 ''It's a quiet and safe town with all of the services,'' said Mr. Lozano, who grew up in Hidalgo. ''People return year after year, and some of the climbers have already moved here.'' 
 Posada El Potrero Chico, (52-1) 81-8362-6672; www.elpotrerochico.com.mx; weeklong guided climbing trips from $1,511 a person, including guide, equipment, airport shuttle and lodging in a casita with private bath; November through March.
 DEEP-SEA FISHING: CABO SAN LUCAS In 1940, John Steinbeck embarked on an expedition to the Sea of Cortez to catalog marine life along Cabo's rocky, undeveloped coastline, and found it ''ferocious with life.'' Though the town of Cabo San Lucas is now known as a luxury golf destination, it first earned its reputation through its prized access to waters teeming with fish. With the Pacific Ocean on one side and the Sea of Cortez on the other, Cabo offers exceptional sport fishing at the confluence of both in the harbor's deep-water canyons.
 The area hasn't been nicknamed the ''marlin capital of the world'' for nothing. An estimated 50,000 billfish -- fast-swimming trophy fish that include marlin, swordfish and sailfish -- are caught every year, and angling competitions stir up the resort strip in the fall months. Sustainable tourism calls for catch-and-release practices for billfish -- their populations have steeply declined over the past 50 years -- though fishing operators will let you keep commonly caught game fish like yellowfin tuna, roosterfish, Spanish mackerel and dorado. On most fishing trips, the crew will clean, fillet and freeze your selected catch to take home for eating.
 While the rocky intertidal zone that Steinbeck discovered in Cabo back then has been almost completely overrun by beaches and resort development, a day spent on the water captures some of that wonder. The quintessential Cabo angler experience includes chartering a small panga, or open fishing launch, early in the morning (unless you happen to be a movie star, in which case fully serviced 110-foot boats are more common). Swordfish are most plentiful January through June, as are sailfish, and the best conditions for blue and black marlin are July through November, when big storms put populations on the move. Striped marlin is caught year round.
 ''The fishing experience in Cabo can be unforgettable, and the marlin are the biggest challenge -- they're what people come here to catch,'' said Juan Beltran, a reservations agent and dockmaster for Pisces Fleet Sportfishing. The company's fleet ranks No. 2 in the world in the number of released striped marlin, according to the Billfish Foundation, a nonprofit organization that supports the conservation of global billfish populations. Recently, Mr. Beltran said, the tight-knit fishing community has begun lobbying the Mexican government to change its new regulations that allow midsize commercial shark fishing boats to come as close as 10 miles to shore. 
 Shark boats use longlines, which have about 1,000 hooks, and that method results in large incidental catches of other species, and the fishing community is advocating a return to a 50-mile distance to protect juvenile sharks and game fish populations, which are found closer to shore. ''We care about our nature sources here in Cabo,'' said Mr. Beltran. ''They're the source of our livelihood.'' 
 Pisces Sportfishing, (619) 819-7983; www.piscessportfishing.com; a 28-foot boat charter is $560 a day, including crew, tackle, bait, lunch and fishing licenses for four.
 MOUNTAIN BIKING: COPPER CANYON
 Almost all visitors to the Barranca del Cobre, or Copper Canyon -- one of the deepest and largest canyon systems in the world -- show up via train or tour bus, stopping only to take a snapshot or two of the gloriously bizarre rock formations and caves. Actually composed of a series of huge canyons, Copper is traditionally home to the native Tarahumara Indians, a reclusive people who still live in remote canyon villages much as they have for centuries. 
 An eight-hour drive from El Paso, Tex., the town of Creel in the state of Chihuahua is the gateway to Mexico's thriving mountain and road biking scene; every July, it plays host to a major national cycling festival and race series. From this base, at an elevation of 7,600 feet, you'll find that Copper's ins and outs are well suited to two-wheeled exploration; on a mountain bike, you can actually smell the flowers (and feel the dirt). Just about every kind of trail and terrain can be accessed: world-class technical single-track, forest roads, Moab-quality slick rock, rocky desert landscape, challenging long climbs and descents on old mining tracks, and winding back roads. 
 Several companies based in Moab, Utah, including Nichols Expeditions (www.nicholsexpeditions.com) and Western Spirit (www.westernspirit.com), offer weeklong mountain bike excursions to Copper Canyon, with guides and support vehicles. Regular riders looking for a longer itinerary will want to contact KE Adventure Travel, which leads a two-week de facto Tour de Tarahumara. 
 ''There really are epic rides for all tastes,'' said David Appleton, a guide who works with KE's trips in Mexico. ''The difficult part is sorting out all of the trails and rides, since nothing is marked and there are just so many. We have been guiding and riding there for 14 years and have only touched the tip of the iceberg.''
 KE's itinerary is a series of rides in terrain from the highland pine forest at canyon rims to the arid conditions at the base. Most days average about 25 miles, and elevation tops out at 8,200 feet (with one dizzying 4,000-foot descent into Batopilas Canyon along a switchback trail), but easier routes are plentiful. Nights are spent in hotels in town and log cabin lodges along the trail. There's also no shortage of wildlife (parrots, whitetail deer, jaguars) or scenery (cataract waterfalls, deserted mining claims). But bikers say that the highest moments of a trip here might well be the quietest ones -- a meeting with a Tarahumara farmer, for instance, or a fire-illuminated night spent in a cabin, far from electricity.
 KE Adventure Travel, (800) 497-9675; www.keadventure.com; 13-day Copper Canyon bike trip from $2,390, including lodging and meals; late October to early November and March to early April.
 SNORKELING WITH WHALE SHARKS: ISLA HOLBOX
 Forty miles northwest of the party port of Cancun is little-known Isla Holbox (pronounced OLE-bosh), a narrow spit of white sand some 25 miles long and no more than two miles wide at its widest point, situated in the Gulf of Mexico. From June through September, the island's offshore waters are the site of a large congregation of whale sharks, who come here to feed on seasonal plankton blooms. 
 The whale shark is the world's biggest fish -- it can grow to more than 50 feet in length -- and its dark grayish-blue body is dotted with white spots, giving it the local nickname of ''domino.'' Because the whale shark is a vulnerable species, and because coastal mangrove areas are also located here, the Yum Balam Biosphere Reserve was created in 1994 to protect Isla Holbox and its surrounding waters. An active tourism industry has sprung up, providing travelers with the singular experience of snorkeling with whale sharks.
 The population of Holbox -- which was named for its proximity to a spring (Holbox is Mayan for ''black hole'') -- is less than 2,000. There are no cars; most people get around by bike, golf cart or motor scooter. The local economy is still based heavily on fishing, and there is an abundance of seafood restaurants in the main town serving up fresh daily catches of lobster, grouper, red snapper, conch and octopus. Adding to the picture-postcard prettiness are hundreds of flamingos that flock to the island.
 From the Mexican mainland, most visitors get to Holbox by taking a ferry across the lagoon from Chiquila, which takes less than 30 minutes. Day trips are the norm, with local guides taking tourists to see the whale sharks in season; Dove6 Water Tours (www.whalesharkexperience.com), run by a University of Georgia business graduate and his partner, also offers packages that include swimming with whale sharks and scuba diving elsewhere in the Maya Riviera. 
 The Canadian company Gap Adventures organizes an eight-day itinerary to Holbox from Cancun, coordinating accommodation, whale shark tours and other activities for travelers with local Holboxeno suppliers. Out in the waters, whale shark tourism is governed by environmental regulations: snorkelers must remain seven feet from sharks, and boats must stay 100 feet away. Guides are mandatory, scuba diving and fishing are prohibited, and all sunblock must be biodegradable. 
 ''Swimming with the whale sharks was the main reason we went to Holbox, apart from the fact it's a beautiful little island with gorgeous white sandy beaches and few tourists,'' said Jessica Stone, 26, a reflexologist who lives in London and who visited Mexico last year. ''They are just so huge you can't believe you're in the water with them.''
 Gap Adventures, (800) 708-7761; www.gapadventures.com; eight-day Holbox trip from $875.
 BIRD WATCHING: CHIAPAS
 With the Zapatista rebel chief penning mystery novels, and tourism locations in Chiapas featured prominently in last year's Miss Universe pageant, the reputation for sociopoliticalfrictionthat this southern Mexican state has had in the past just might begin to lose some of its edge. But long before Subcomandante Marcos led an indigenous army out of the jungle on New Year's Day 1994, demanding land and other rights for the state's many Indian groups, Chiapas was best known for its incredible biodiversity. In the Lacandon rain forest, the Montes Azules Biosphere Reserve -- designated in 1979 as the first biosphere reserve in Mexico -- protects more than 1,200 square miles, home to a whopping number of bird species (close to 350, which comprises nearly a third of the country's total), at least 3,400 plant species and more than 100 species of mammals.
 The reserve is probably the only place where you'll encounter so many rare birds in the wild, including the quetzal -- whose feathers were prized by ancient civilizations -- and the scarlet macaw, harpy eagle, king vulture and Muscovy duck, all of which are threatened with extinction. 
 The rain forest is also home to endangered jaguars, ocelots and tapirs. Last year, Mountain Travel Sobek began a new wildlife-focused trip that involves active exploration of Montes Azules and other nature areas. Visitors take guided boating trips along the reserve's rivers and hike jungle paths lined with 200-foot ceiba trees, all in search of exotic birds, mammals and Maya archaeological sites. Other activities include swimming in waterfalls and ''crocodile wrestling'' (if you feel like channeling your inner crocodile hunter, you can help scientists catch, measure and tag crocodiles for a local conservation program). The trip also incorporates stays with local indigenous communities and interaction with local researchers who work on ongoing biosphere conservation efforts.
 ''We're getting to know areas that have not been explored by outsiders,'' said Mark Willuhn, trip leader for Mountain Travel Sobek in the region. He is also the director of the nonprofit group Mesoamerican Ecotourism Alliance. ''One of the key things about this place is that there are so many indigenous communities, all with their own distinct cultures and traditions,'' he said. ''People travel all over the world for these kinds of cultural experiences when, two hours from Houston, it's right here.''
 Guests stay at small boutique eco-lodges like the five-room Lacandonia Adventure Lodge, which is in the center of the biosphere reserve. A series of thatched-roof cabanas overlooking Rio Lacantun are constructed of tropical materials including bamboo and palm.

 HIKING: THE SIERRA NORTE
 The Sierra Norte is one of the most biologically diverse mountain systems in Mexico, blanketing an area of about 6,500 square miles in the northern part of Oaxaca state. Its diverse topography includes steep mountain slopes covered in pine and oak, cactus-clad 5,000-foot valleys and lush tropical coastline, with an elevation range from sea level to 10,000 feet. Much of the biological richness of the Sierra Norte is found in its mountainous cloud forests, long isolated because of their steep slopes and high altitudes. 
 The Sierra Norte is part of a bioregion designated by Conservation International as one of the richest and most endangered in the world, with unique species of orchids and wildlife including southern flying squirrels, Pacific orange tip butterflies, Oaxaca hummingbirds and white-throated jays.
 Because of its remoteness, the Sierra Norte is seldom explored beyond the fringes of the city of Oaxaca, and much of it is inhabited by various indigenous communities. But the hiking in the Sierra Norte is stunning, and the Puerto Vallarta-based travel company Journey Mexico leads a nine-day tour that takes trekkers through a tapestry of ecosystems. The outfitter has also partnered with local residents to visit indigenous villages.
 The trip starts with an exploration of the colorful and historic city of Oaxaca, including visits to the pre-Columbian ruins of Monte Alban and Mitla. From there, it continues to the mountains, where a few days are spent hiking and living in the Sierra Norte with Zapotec communities that remain largely traditional and untouched by modern life. 
 Residents have set up a system of trails and cabins. The tour company hopes that by creating opportunities for local people to become guides or lodge owners, they will have alternatives to working in logging, which has already cut through some areas. The hiking level throughout is moderate, with some full- and half-day hikes; most are through valley and forest landscapes. 
 A big draw is the rare chance to meet with local people and learn about the sacred traditions of the rural region. The itinerary also includes two nights spent at a beach-side lodge in the fishing village of Puerto Escondido on the Pacific; from here, guests can kayak and hike into mangrove-lined estuaries and perhaps view endangered sea turtles laying eggs. They can also scuba dive, snorkel, kayak and surf. The best is saved for last, when a hike from the slopes of the Sierra Madre del Sur leads through deep tropical lowland jungle to a crashing waterfall and swimming hole.

HEADLINE: Free Trade: The Math and the Morality

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''What to Expect When You're Free Trading'' (Op-Ed, Jan. 16): 
 Steven E. Landsburg should be commended for presenting us with an unabashed exposition of the social Darwinist mantra that is at the core of the right-wing establishment in America. 
 The absence of even the slightest compassion or of any commentary about the need for assistance for those who have fallen victim to the deleterious side of free trade is quite revealing and instructive. 
 As it pertains to those losers, as he refers to them, one would hope that Mr. Landsburg might be kind enough to ''let them eat cake.'' 
 Alan J. Ross Newton, Mass., Jan. 16, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Steven E. Landsburg may be right that when the direct costs and savings are summed up, ''Americans as a group are net winners'' from outsourcing, but there is more to it than that. He spends his time adding and subtracting, but he has not figured out how to count the corrosive effects of widespread insecurity on American democracy.
 Many products made abroad have become cheaper, but globalization is forcing us to balance those measurable gains against a pernicious vulnerability that undermines the implicit social compact of shared progress in advanced civilizations. 
 The efficiency-driven economy that Mr. Landsburg extols may produce a large monetary return, but it does not value what it cannot enumerate: the collective benefits that arise from broad optimism and confidence in a secure future for each person. 
 William S. Kessler Seattle, Jan. 16, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Yes, I would rather pay $5 than $20 for anything. But when my $15 savings results in a lower standard of living for my fellow Americans, a larger subclass and the resultant economic disparity (and perhaps impact on social services), then maybe I ought to just chalk up my increased costs to the advantage of living in a country that cares enough to promote safety standards, a living wage and economic opportunity.
 There's nothing free about free trade.
 David Chavez San Francisco, Jan. 16, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Steven E. Landsburg does not point out why ''free trade'' is not what we have in America today. Corporate cronyism and corporate welfare prevent the establishment of true free trade. 
 Legislation that makes it virtually impossible for people to start their own businesses because of all the rules and required permits means that people do not have the freedom to be truly innovative on their own. 
 Don't confuse capitalism with true free trade. 
 Karen Leonard Willits, Calif., Jan. 16, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Steven E. Landsburg suggests that displaced American workers are ''churlish'' to criticize free trade when their manufacturing jobs (and millions others) are sent overseas. It's his view that ''what we lose through lower wages is more than offset by what we gain through lower prices.'' 
 This is not what we found in a study released last year that looked at the impact of trade-related market distortions across 10 United States industries from steel and shrimp to furniture, cement and raspberries. 
 We discovered that there is, on average, a 50-to-1 economic advantage in keeping jobs in the United States through penalties on illegally subsidized or dumped imports. Any slight increase in consumer prices was more than offset by the economic activity that wages, business and profits contributed to the economy. 
 And so, despite Mr. Landsburg's attitude that workers should just get over it, the correct course for the country and its workers should be to strengthen domestic manufacturing, enforce fair trade laws and, with those steps, allow more Americans to share in the benefits of the global economy.
 To do otherwise is to court continuous borrowing from overseas and encourage the market-distorting practices that are now roiling world markets. 
 Scott Paul Director, Alliance for American Manufacturing Washington, Jan. 16, 2008
 To the Editor:
 One would expect a professor of economics like Steven E. Landsburg to understand that the strength of our consumer economy rests squarely on the shoulders of the middle class. It is self-interest, not morality, that propels us to help those middle-class workers who lose their jobs because of free trade. 
 Americans can thrive only if the middle class remains strong. Unfortunately, the loss of jobs is only one of the many threats to that core strength of our country. 
 The transfer of wealth away from the middle class started decades ago with the trickle-down theory. It's time we started investing once again in the human capital that is America.
 Joan Marshall Fort Myers, Fla., Jan. 16, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Steven E. Landsburg suggests that if I discovered I could buy shampoo online at a lower price than I had been paying at my local pharmacy, I would do so, and that I would feel no obligation to compensate my pharmacist. 
 In fact, if I care about having a neighborhood with things like a local pharmacy (and I do, for what it's worth), then I will continue to buy my shampoo there even if I have to pay a bit more. 
 And I would be getting a great bargain -- not only shampoo, but also a community. 
 Yancy Hughes Dominick Seattle, Jan. 16, 2008
 To the Editor: 
 Many opponents of free trade like to appeal to a higher ideal. They see material progress as vapid and unimportant. But what about intellectual and artistic progress?
 How many artists, academics and intellectuals would be around if we had to grow our own food and build our own houses? Writing was developed when trade made it a necessity in Mesopotamia.
 Free trade makes artistic and intellectual pursuits possible. Intellectuals who disdain trade and its material progress do so at their own peril.
 Alex Nowrasteh Washington, Jan. 16, 2008
 The writer is a research associate at the Competitive Enterprise Institute.
 To the Editor:
 The argument for compensating losers from free trade is that unless this is done, a majority might oppose free-trade agreements. The issue is not moral deserts but political needs. 
 An electorate that valued greater equality with modest growth more than greater inequality with greater growth would oppose freer trade. 
 The economy might flourish more under freer trade, but if too many voters are worse or no better off, political support for such trade will wither. 
 Similarly, municipalities, which cannot ban interstate trade, often support locally owned businesses, like pharmacies and diners, through tax incentives because local citizens vote to do so.

HEADLINE: A Community Tries To Shrink Its Footprint

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME. 
E-mail: peappl@nytimes.com

DATELINE: WESTPORT, Conn. 

 BODY:
 Local governments and boards tend to be good at some things -- fixing potholes, putting police officers on the streets, naming parks or schools for beloved village elders. 
 They tend to be less good at others, like, say, saving the world.
 So it's hard to make too much of the 60 or so people who turned out on a snowy, non-global-warming Thursday night for an event held by the Westport Green Energy Task Force. But it also might be a mistake to make too little. 
 Westport, with its beachfront parks and leafy neighborhoods where the populace naturally tilts green, is ahead of the game but hardly unique in trying, in its own small way, to address climate change through public and private action. 
 ''Our big job is to tell people they can do something,'' said Carl Leaman, a former selectman who is chairman of the group, formed a year ago. ''Many people acknowledge there's a problem and they don't know what to do. So the first thing we did was come up with the carbon footprint and then came up with ways to reduce it.''
 The carbon footprint, the measure of human impact on the environment in terms of greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide, was 18 tons per person per year -- relatively high because Interstate 95 passes through town. The goal was to find ways to reduce it by a ton a year for the next three years.
 That's doable if enough people do relatively painless things like replace three light bulbs with compact fluorescents (300 pounds), drop thermostats to 68 from 70 (2,000 pounds), take shorter showers (350 pounds) and turn off electronic devices they're not using (1,000 pounds). You get 6,000 pounds by trading in a standard car for a hybrid, but even in Westport, not everyone is ready to ante up for a Prius. 
 That's added to various public initiatives, like solar panels at fire headquarters, no-idling policies for most city vehicles. The agenda item Thursday night was the showing of ''Everything's Cool,'' a documentary about the long, slow trudge toward an understanding of the enormous stakes of addressing climate change. 
 It's both breezy and sobering, whistling its way past the edge of despair, arguing that the Bush administration and shills for the oil industry have kept a fake debate going about whether global warming is real as a way to suck the passion and urgency out of doing anything about it.
 So when the author and environmentalist Bill McKibben laments in the film that the financial world, with its thrilling booms and crushing busts, its plucky efforts to ward off recessions, its fevers and chills, seems more real to us than the natural world where we live, you could see people nodding throughout the room. 
 CLIMATE change, after all, was cited as an issue in the 1950s. Its dangers were noted in a report to President Jimmy Carter in the 1970s. It was a Time magazine cover story in 1987. 
 And after all this time, we're left with earnest groups like the Westport Green Energy Task Force doing their best to get neighbors to be sure to regularly change their cars' oil filters and take shorter showers? We're not further along than this?
 Actually, we probably are. Anthony Leiserowitz, director of the Yale Project on Climate Change at the university's School of Forestry and Environmental Studies, has been following attitudes on climate change for a decade. 
 He said Americans are increasingly convinced that global warming is happening (71 percent) and is already having dangerous effects around the world or soon will be (48 percent -- up 20 percentage points in three years). A majority, 62 percent, now says global warming is an urgent threat requiring immediate and drastic action, and there's widespread support for local and national actions, though not for more taxes on gas or electricity use. 
 There's finally concerted Congressional activity, and it's an issue, if not the main one, in presidential politics. What it lacks is national action, leadership and focus, someone or something that makes a tingle in the collective neurons, part yearning, part dread, a cause. 
 Which is why 60 people watching a movie in Westport mattered, not for what they could do, but for the moment they represented and the recognition of how much more was needed. 
 ''People realize what's at stake and how much more needs to happen,'' said Kimberly Lake, vice chairwoman of the task force. ''You need to do more than just change your light bulbs to C.F.L.'s. That's important. It makes a difference. But trickle up isn't enough. You need trickle down if you want to make massive changes.''

HEADLINE: BIG DEAL

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
CONGRATULATIONS, Manhattan town house owners! Your houses are worth more than ever. And, by the way, the government has noticed.
 The city just released its tentative assessment rolls for the next tax year, along with reams of information about property sales trends. Outside Manhattan, the city found that the market value of one-, two- and three-family homes fell last year. 
 But city tax files show that actual sales prices soared in Manhattan in 2007, though at a slower rate than in 2006, giving everyone a reason to celebrate so far -- including the tax collectors. Though the weakening economy makes the future outlook uncertain, brokers say that in past downturns, prices of town houses held up much longer than co-ops or condominiums.
 City tax files, released, city officials say, to increase the ''transparency'' of the tax system, indicates that the average house price across Manhattan, from the prime neighborhoods on the Upper East Side to the rapidly gentrifying houses in Upper Manhattan, rose by more than 19 percent, to $5.15 million from $4.32 million the year before. 
 In 2006, the average sale price went up 30 percent, from $3.32 million the year before. The Upper East Side, with an average price of almost $10.1 million in its 54 sales, drove up the Manhattan averages, offset in part by 66 sales in Harlem with an average sale price of about $1.4 million. Harlem prices were up 20 percent from the year before (though the Harlem totals include a small house on Park Avenue and East 97th Street, just north of the traditional boundary with the Upper East Side, that sold for $3.3 million).
 On the West Side and in Greenwich Village, the average house went for about $6.2 million, according to the city data. Starter houses on the East and West Side began about $3.5 million, at or below the price of many larger new glass-walled condos. These figures do not include the sales of town houses with more than three apartments, which sometime sell for less, because they come complete with rent-regulated tenants.
 Even on the Upper East Side there was quite a range of town houses that buyers could choose from last year, varying by location, price and size. Last January, a town house at 177 East 70th Street, just off Third Avenue, sold for $3.55 million, making it the lowest-priced town house to sell on the Upper East Side last year. The three-story brownstone with a bay window on the second floor is in a historic district, but next door to a 20-story co-op. It is 12 and a half feet wide, with nearly 2,500 square feet of space, according to tax records.
 The highest sale price on the Upper East Side was $50 million, for a 31-foot mansion sold by Edgar Bronfman Jr., an heir to the Seagram's liquor fortune and the chairman of the Warner Music Group, at 15 East 64th Street. It closed last October.

HEADLINE: Overseas Investors Buying U.S. Holdings at Record Pace

BYLINE: By PETER S. GOODMAN and LOUISE STORY

 BODY:
Last May, a Saudi Arabian conglomerate bought a Massachusetts plastics maker. In November, a French company established a new factory in Adrian, Mich., adding 189 automotive jobs to an area accustomed to layoffs. In December, a British company bought a New Jersey maker of cough syrup.
 For much of the world, the United States is now on sale at discount prices. With credit tight, unemployment growing and worries mounting about a potential recession, American business and government leaders are courting foreign money to keep the economy growing. Foreign investors are buying aggressively, taking advantage of American duress and a weak dollar to snap up what many see as bargains, while making inroads to the world's largest market. 
 Last year, foreign investors poured a record $414 billion into securing stakes in American companies, factories and other properties through private deals and purchases of publicly traded stock, according to Thomson Financial, a research firm. That was up 90 percent from the previous year and more than double the average for the last decade. It amounted to more than one-fourth of all announced deals for the year, Thomson said. 
 During the first two weeks of this year, foreign businesses agreed to invest another $22.6 billion for stakes in American companies -- more than half the value of all announced deals. If a recession now unfolds and the dollar drops further, the pace could accelerate, economists say. 
 The surge of foreign money has injected fresh tension into a running debate about America's place in the global economy. It has supplied state governors with a new development strategy -- attracting foreign money. And it has reinvigorated sometimes jingoistic worries about foreigners securing control of America's fortunes, a narrative last heard in the 1980s as Americans bought up Hondas and Rockefeller Center landed in Japanese hands.
 With a growing share of investment coming from so-called sovereign wealth funds -- vast pools of money controlled by governments from China to the Middle East -- lawmakers and regulators are calling for greater scrutiny to ensure that foreign countries do not gain influence over the financial system or military-related technology. On the presidential campaign trail, the Democratic candidates have begun to focus on these foreign funds, calling for international rules that would make them more transparent. 
 Debate is swirling in Washington about the best way to stimulate a flagging economy. Despite divided opinion about the merits, foreign investment may be preventing deeper troubles by infusing hard-luck companies with cash and keeping some in business.
 The most conspicuous beneficiaries are Wall Street banks like Merrill Lynch, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley, which have sold stakes to government-controlled funds in Asia and the Middle East to compensate for calamitous losses on mortgage markets. Beneath the headlines, a more profound shift is under way: Foreign entities last year captured stakes in American companies in businesses as diverse as real estate, steel-making, energy and baby food. 
 The influx is the result of a confluence of factors that have made the United States both reliant on the largesse of foreigners and an alluring place for opportunistic investors. With American banks reeling from the housing downturn and loath to lend, businesses are hungry for cash.
 The weak dollar has made American companies and properties cheaper in global terms, particularly for European and Canadian buyers. Even as Americans confront the prospect of a recession, economic growth remains strong worldwide, endowing oil producers like Saudi Arabia and Russia and export powers like China and Germany with abundant cash.
 As the German company ThyssenKrupp Stainless broke ground in November on what is to be a $3.7 billion stainless steel plant in Calvert, Ala., its executives spoke effusively about the low cost of production in the United States and the chance to reach many millions of customers -- particularly because of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which allows goods to flow into Mexico and Canada free of duty.
 ''The Nafta stainless steel market has great potential, and we're committed to significantly expanding our business in this growth region,'' said the company's chairman, Jurgen H. Fechter, according to a statement.
 Foreign giants like Toyota Motor and Sony have been sinking capital into American plants. Investment in the American subsidiaries of foreign companies grew to $43.3 billion last year from $39.2 billion the previous year, according to the research and consulting firm OCO Monitor.
 ''This is a vote of confidence in the American economy, the American marketplace and the American worker,'' the deputy Treasury secretary, Robert M. Kimmitt, said. ''These investments keep Americans employed and keep balance sheets strong.''
 Five million Americans now work for foreign companies set up in the United States, Mr. Kimmitt said, and those jobs pay 30 percent more than similar work at domestic companies. Nearly a third of such jobs are in manufacturing, which explains why Rust Belt states have been wooing foreign investment.
 ''We've lost 400,000 manufacturing jobs,'' said Michigan's governor, Jennifer M. Granholm, a Democrat, who has traveled three times to Europe and twice to Japan in pursuit of investment since taking office in 2003. ''I've got to get jobs for our people.''
 Some labor unions see the acceleration of foreign takeovers as the latest indignity wrought by globalization.
 ''It's the culmination of a series of fool's errands,'' said Leo W. Gerard, international president of the United Steelworkers. ''We've hollowed out our industrial base and run up this massive trade deficit, and now the countries that have built the deficits are coming back to buy up our assets. It's like spitting in your face.''
 Other labor groups take a more pragmatic view. 
 ''We need investment and we need to create good jobs,'' said Thea Lee, policy director for the A.F.L.-C.I.O. in Washington. ''We're not in the position to be too choosy about where that investment comes from. But it does bring home the consequences of flawed trade policies over many, many years that we're in this position of being dependent.''
 At the center of concern is the growing influence of sovereign wealth funds, which invested $21.5 billion in American companies last year, according to Thomson. Analysts say they could skew markets by investing to improve the fortunes of their national companies or to pursue political goals. 
 ''This is a phenomenon that could be called the growth of state capitalism as opposed to market capitalism,'' said Jeffrey E. Garten, a trade expert at the Yale School of Management. ''The United States has not ever been on the receiving end of this before.''
 Perhaps emblematic of national ambivalence, in an appearance on CNBC last week, the voluble market analyst Jim Cramer spoke in menacing terms about the growing role of state investment funds from the Middle East and China.
 ''Do we want the communists to own the banks, or the terrorists?'' Mr. Cramer asked. ''I'll take any of it, I guess, because we're so desperate.''
 Proponents of investment from overseas note that finance from sovereign wealth funds is a mere trickle of the overall flow from abroad. Indeed, the bulk comes from Europe, Canada and Japan. Just as Americans have scattered investments around the world in pursuit of profit -- with holdings of foreign stock and debt exceeding $6 trillion in 2006, according to the Treasury Department -- foreigners are looking to the United States, with their capital generating economic activity, proponents say.
 If fear of foreign money now inspires Americans to erect new barriers, that would damage the economy, said Todd M. Malan, president of the Organization for International Investment, a Washington lobbying group financed by foreign companies.
 ''The policy choices on the negative side would have enormous economic implications that would make the current situation look like a bubble bath,'' he said.
 Tensions spawned by foreign investment hark back to the 1980s, when Japan snapped up prominent American businesses like Columbia Pictures, and some intoned that the American way of life was under assault. The new wave of foreign money is washing in at an even more important time, analysts say. 
 The United States has lost more than three million manufacturing jobs since 2001, with foreign trade often taking the blame. Foreign-made goods now account for roughly one-third of all wares consumed in the United States, roughly tripling their share over the last quarter-century. The soaring price of oil and a widening trade deficit underscore how the American economy is increasingly vulnerable to decisions made far away. 
 In 2005, Congressional opposition scuttled a bid by the state-owned Chinese energy company Cnooc to buy the American oil company Unocal. The following year, furor on Capitol Hill prevented DP World, a company based in the United Arab Emirates, from buying several major American ports.
 No such outcry has greeted the purchase of stakes in major Wall Street banks by state investment funds in the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, China, Singapore and South Korea. This is largely because the banks sold passive slices and ceded no formal control, which would have set off a federal review of the national security implications. But the silence also reflects the imperative that these enormous institutions swiftly secure cash.
 ''It would be good if these companies didn't need all this capital and better if the capital was available in the United States,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, who was a vocal opponent of the DP World deal. ''But given the situation that these institutions find themselves in and the fact that there's a pretty strong credit squeeze, there's only two choices: Have foreign companies invest in these firms or have massive layoffs.''
 In years past, particularly when Japanese money washed in, many foreign purchases proved not to be so prudent in the end. This time, with the dollar weak and troubled American companies in a poor bargaining position, the prices really do seem cheap, some economists say.
 ''They're buying financial assets at well under book value,'' said Gary C. Hufbauer, a trade expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
 Trade experts assume tensions will rise as developing countries -- which tend to have more state companies -- continue to expand their share of investment in the United States. 
 Canada still spends the most money buying stakes in American companies -- more than $65 billion in 2007, according to Thomson. But other countries' purchases are growing rapidly. South Korea's investments swelled to more than $10.4 billion last year from just $5.4 million in 2000. Russia went to $572 million from $60 million in that span; India to $3.3 billion from $364 million. 
 But even if political tension increases, so will the flow of foreign money, some analysts say, for the simple reason that businesses need it. 
 ''The forces sucking in this capital are much bigger than the political forces,'' said Mr. Garten, the Yale trade expert. ''If there is a big controversy, it will be between Washington on the one hand and corporate America on the other. In that contest, the financiers and the businessmen are going to win, as they always do.''

HEADLINE: Who Needs a 401(k)? I'd Rather Have a Castle

BYLINE: By HARRY HURT III

 BODY:
HUMANITY'S need for shelter has always inspired grandiose desires that can become tantamount to lust. The Tenth Commandment even places housing and lust side by side, admonishing, ''Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's house, thou shalt not covet they neighbor's wife.''
 Putting a modern-day finish on this propensity is ''House Lust: America's Obsession With Our Homes'' by Daniel McGinn (Currency, $24.95), which chronicles an epic of satirical, if not quite biblical, proportions. 
 Mr. McGinn, a national correspondent for Newsweek, focuses mainly on the demand side of the nation's most recent housing boom-turned-bust. His aim, he says, is to ''explore the behavior and psychology that drove the boom -- and how those behaviors and psychology helped contribute to the bust that followed.'' 
 He raises several provocative questions that strike at the covetous soul of America's culture and economy.
 ''How did home renovations come to routinely turn families' lives upside down?'' he asks. ''Why do thousands of us now watch reality shows about home flipping or house hunting? Why did so many people decide to start investing in real estate, or quit good jobs to seek a fortune selling houses?''
 Mr. McGinn organizes his quest for answers into seven chapters that span the nation's geography and the selected segment of demography he defines as ''upper middle class'' or ''flat-out rich.''
 He tackles obsessions with house size in a chapter entitled ''Mine's Bigger Than Yours,'' set in Potomac, Md. In Las Vegas, he sniffs out ''That New House Smell'' and the psychological need to live in an unspoiled home built from scratch. In Newton, Mass., he diagnoses ''Fix-Up Fever'' of people who renovate or add on to their homes, not just for the sake of making prudent investments but for the purpose of one-upping their neighbors. He goes ''Searching for Cash Flow'' in the form of income-producing rental properties in Pocatello, Idaho, and gets a personal ''Welcome to the Jungle'' when he decides to get his own real estate license after paying a visit to a National Association of Realtors convention.
 Mr. McGinn steers clear of examining cases of home mortgage foreclosures and predatory lending practices. As a result, he leaves the reader to draw the specific causal connections between the types of obsessive behaviors he describes and the recent housing bust. But the gist of it is that like poorer people, many affluent people spent -- and borrowed -- more money than they could afford because they believed that their magnificent homes, in lieu of diversified savings or retirement plans, would yield magnificent profits. 
 What makes ''House Lust'' worth reading is its marshaling of facts that speak eloquently for themselves. Why have Americans recently become so obsessed with their homes? 
 Two sets of statistics say it all. First, homes are the most common personal investment. By 2006, some 69 percent of Americans owned their homes, up from only 44 percent in 1940. Second, homeownership has been -- at least until the advent of the subprime mortgage crisis last summer -- an easy road to amassing wealth. From 2000 to 2006, Mr. McGinn reports, the average price of a home in the United States soared 56 percent.
 Add to this a newly overwhelming lust for space. In 1950, the average American home measured just 938 square feet. By 2005, the average had grown to 2,434 square feet. The size of the putative American dream house expanded even more.
 At a convention of the nation's home builders in 1984, an ideal ''New American Home'' on display encompassed 1,500 square feet and cost less than $100,000. In 2006, the ideal house was 10,023 square fee, and was priced at more than $10 million. In the interim, Bill Gates of Microsoft built a 66,000-square-foot home near Seattle at an estimated cost of $100 million. 
 The rise in house sizes has not been accompanied by qualitative leaps in the use of space. Yes, there have been innumerable technological advances in everything from heating and air-conditioning to kitchen appliances. Home theaters and so-called mud rooms, for changing into and out of foul-weather garments, have become the rage.
 But as Mr. McGinn notes, ''Unlike the robber baron-era mansions, modern-day megahomes don't feature dozens of bedrooms or entirely new kinds of rooms -- they mostly just take the rooms you'd find in a normal house and make them really, really big.''
 The challenge of filling up those rooms, he adds, is being met by outsize furnishings like the ''extreme ultra king bed'' that is 12 feet long and 10 feet wide.
 The sheer absurdity of house lust seems made for a humorist like Mark Twain or P. J. O'Rourke. Although Mr. McGinn's partly tongue-in-cheek profiles of obsessive homeowners are mildly entertaining, most of the one-liners are lame or redundant, or both.
 ''Today, in some neighborhoods,'' he observes, ''finding someone who doesn't know the square footage of her house can be as hard as finding a Playboy centerfold who doesn't know her bust size.'' Twenty pages later, he notes, ''Today a homeowner who doesn't know the square footage of his house is becoming as rare as a high school senior who doesn't know his SAT score.''
 In publishing as in real estate, timing is everything. Mr. McGinn's book went to press late last summer just as news of the subprime mortgage mess was breaking.
 ''Our homes may no longer be making us rich,'' he writes, ''but living through an era when we thought they might has resulted in a permanent shift in thinking -- one that will leave many of us happily obsessed with houses for years to come.'' 
 The millions of Americans currently facing home mortgage foreclosures will probably regard such unbounded optimism as the eighth deadly sin.

HEADLINE: The Real Price of Fakes

 BODY:
As the economy weakens, consumers hunt for bargains. Sometimes, however, a bargain can be a literal steal, and a dangerous one at that. The World Customs Organization estimates that 7 percent of goods traded in the world are counterfeit -- a black market that increasingly includes pharmaceuticals, electronics and other products that must be safe enough to use. 
 With some $200 billion worth of those pirated or counterfeited goods coming into the United States each year, already weak regulatory agencies are overwhelmed. That means that far too often the burden falls on the buyer to avoid getting stuck with, or hurt by, hazardous fakes. That is not always easy, and the horror stories in recent years have included pet food that harmed or killed hundreds of pets in the United States. More recently, counterfeit batteries have been recalled because they tend to overheat and even explode. 
 Consumer Reports offered a good primer this month on how to spot the dangerous fakes. Like others who talk about the three Ps -- price, place and packaging -- the magazine's editors warn that a superlow price should be the first clue. Buyers should also be wary of retailers who fail to provide a receipt or pay sales tax. Flimsy packaging or misspelled words offer more signals. Underwriters Laboratory, which gives a seal of approval to electronics, now uses an expensive, difficult-to-copy hologram. Plenty of holiday lights or power strips with bogus UL seals still make it past customs agents.
 Some people in Congress want to tighten penalties on counterfeiters, a good but modest move. More to the point, the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the Food and Drug Administration need more money. And businesses that often avoid acknowledging the fake trade, for fear of damaging their brand, should be more open with consumers about how to tell the difference between real and unreal. Until then, buyer beware.

HEADLINE: No Room at the Lot and Late at the Gate

BYLINE: By MICHELLE HIGGINS

 BODY:
WITH more travelers taking to the skies, it's becoming harder to find a parking spot at the airport.
 Long-term parking at San Francisco International Airport filled up 70 days last year. Parking lots at Kennedy Airport in New York overflowed on Christmas Day. And because of the limited number of long-term spaces at La Guardia Airport (just 918), spots are practically gone every day by 9 a.m. 
 And it's not just along the coasts. The parking lots at Dallas Fort Worth International had 2.84 million vehicles in the year ended Sept. 30, up about 5 percent from the previous year. Phoenix Sky Harbor International had a 3 percent increase, to an estimated 4.34 million parked cars last year. And the long-term spaces at Pittsburgh International were filled about 20 percent of the time. 
 When lots fill up, travelers can spend precious moments circling for parking, possibly missing their flights. Paula Martin, a certified public accountant from Sandy Springs, Ga., learned this the hard way last summer. After being turned away from the parking lot she normally uses near Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International, she spent 30 minutes driving around in search of a spot -- time she had planned to use checking in and getting through security check points. In the end she made the flight, but just barely. ''I was very close to missing my flight and very stressed out because of it,'' Ms. Martin said.
 The parking crunch isn't just affecting travelers catching a flight. It's a problem for the people picking them up, too. At Phoenix, for example, the garage for Terminal 4, which serves more than 75 percent of the airport's passengers, is often crowded by midday, especially on Wednesdays. When it does fill up, drivers are forced to park in remote lots and take buses back to the terminal to meet arriving passengers. 
 But with some simple planning, it's possible to beat the system. One method gaining popularity is to reserve a spot online. Services like Park 'N Fly Network (www.parknflynetwork.com) and AirportParkingReservations.com allow travelers to search for and reserve a parking spot at so-called off-airport lots by plugging in their departure airport and travel dates. Park 'N Fly Network, based in Atlanta, takes reservations for parking space near 67 airports in its network ranging from self-parking with bus shuttles to valet parking with amenities like car washes and oil changes. AirportParkingReservations, based in Madison, Conn., offers reservations for spots near 200 airports, which it plots on a Google map to give users a sense of how far they are from the terminals. 
 In addition to peace of mind, these online services can save money over airport parking lots. For example, the cheapest lots at Hartsfield in Atlanta cost $9 a day. Park 'N Fly Network has parking as low as $7 a day. The trade-off, of course, is the distance to the terminal. Air Park Parking (www.airparkparking.com) recommends, for example, that drivers parking near La Guardia add 15 minutes to their travel times. But some off-airport sites offer perks to make up for the added time. Besides offering shuttle service every three to five minutes at some airports, Park 'N Fly, a chain of 18 facilities within the Park 'N Fly Network, has taken to handing out disposable booties for passengers to wear when they take off their shoes at security checkpoints. 
 Not to be outdone, airports are working on their own improvements to ease parking congestion. Kennedy is planning to build a 1,500-space garage across from the new JetBlue terminal in time for summer travel. Construction for a 5,000-vehicle parking ramp is under way at Minneapolis-St. Paul International, bringing its total to 22,000. Hartsfield regularly updates the status of its parking lots on its Web site, www.atlanta-airport.com. (The day after Christmas, all three economy lots were full, but seven other lots, including daily and airport park-ride shuttle lots were open.) And for passengers willing to pay a premium, Hartsfield also guarantees overnight parking spots in the Gold Reserve Lots near the North and South terminals. Gold parkers pay $24 a day with an annual minimum fee of $288. In return they are ensured a parking space with no waiting in line to take a ticket or look for a space. 
 IN addition, more airports are creating free cellphone waiting lots to help alleviate traffic generated by passenger pick ups. Instead of circling the terminal, drivers can wait at these designated lots until their arriving party calls. Detroit Metro Airport, for instance, has a newly expanded cellphone waiting area at the Smith Terminal, with 37-spaces next to the airport's rental-car facilities. Check your airport's Web site for parking and cellphone waiting area information. 
 Airport hotels are starting to get in on the act, too, by offering packages with parking and shuttle service included. The Hyatt Regency at O'Hare International in Chicago, for example, is offering parking for up to 10 nights with a one-night stay. And ParkSleepFly.com offers parking and hotel packages at airport hotels in the United States, Europe and Canada; its cruiseport feature specializes in deals for popular cruise departure cities in the United States, as well as Toronto. 
 Wherever you decide to park, keep in mind that peak parking periods correspond to air traffic patterns. Lots are filled quickly on holidays, like the upcoming Presidents' Day weekend. Spots are also hard to find midweek, when lots fill up with business travelers. Park 'N Fly Network recommends securing a spot three to four weeks ahead of time for peak travel periods. During the recent holiday period, for example, all its parking spots were taken by mid-December at Kennedy, Phoenix, Miami International and Orlando International.

CORRECTION-DATE: February 3, 2008

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, the Practical Traveler column on Jan. 20 about airport parking misstated the number of airports served by AirportParkingReservations.com, which allows travelers to reserve parking spots through the Web site. It is more than 65, not 200. (The service does offer reservations at more than 200 lots at those airports.)

HEADLINE: Timber Thieves Strike at the Heart of Lands Held Dear

BYLINE: By SUSAN SAULNY; Catrin Einhorn contributed reporting.

DATELINE: ROYALTON, Vt. 

 BODY:
The trees around George and Agnes Spaulding's 170-year-old farmhouse here are as good as money in the bank, many being old-growth maples that are valuable not only for the quality of their wood but also for the sweet sap that the couple boils into syrup each spring.
 Having been born on the farm, Mr. Spaulding, 78, loves the trees the way only someone who grew up with them could. But beyond that, he counts on the syrup sales to supplement the family income, which comes mainly from the twice-a-day milking of three dozen cows.
 So when a neighboring farmer crossed onto the Spauldings' land and chopped down 30 or so of their best trees, the couple was devastated. 
 ''There were a lot of nights spent worrying, and when I'd get up, I'd just see bare stumps,'' said Mr. Spaulding, who was awarded about $30,000 for the tree loss in a civil lawsuit against his neighbor last month. ''The wood was sold for lumber. And he didn't leave much very good.'' 
 Across the country, trees are disappearing in cases that are often small in scale but largely unsettling, probably prompted by the rise in timber value and the increase in worldwide demand for American hardwood -- particularly from builders in Europe and China. The total value of the American log export market has more than doubled since 2000, industry experts said, and it continues to grow. 
 In the United States, forests are not being illegally logged on a systemic scale, as is the case in countries like Indonesia, Malawi and Brazil, where unauthorized harvesting has led to serious deforestation and attendant environmental problems. Here, the issue is often scattered and intimate, and often affects homeowners, parks and public forests. 
 In Flint, Mich., for instance, thieves last month stole black walnut trees from the grassy landscaped edge of a main city street. Earlier last year, people were snatching saplings from a city park there as soon as they were planted. 
 ''It's a different scale and victim,'' said Paul Harwood, who owns a forest management and wildlife consulting business in central Vermont, contrasting the domestic problem to the larger international issue. ''But it's still a loss that goes well beyond the value of the trees.''
 In Arkansas, predators want pine; tree rustlers hit a small section of a state forest sometime in the last few weeks, an investigator said, leaving only stumps. In Kentucky, thieves hunt with muffled chain saws for oak, chestnut and cherry trees. And as the Spauldings learned, maple trees are tall targets of the Northeast.
 ''It's getting so much worse that I'd say in every county in Kentucky we have timber theft issues,'' said Dea Riley, executive director of the Appalachian Roundtable, which provides resources and legal help to victims of tree rustlers. ''So many more people are showing up to say, 'Hey, my timber got stolen.' The phone just hasn't stopped ringing. We have a waiting list of victims that we won't get to in a year.''
 Ms. Riley continued, ''Most of these people don't have the money to fight for themselves when they are victimized. And many of these cases are huge losses to the landowner.''
 Data on timber theft is hard to come by because, experts say, much of it goes unreported, and many states lump it with other crimes under general property theft handled at the local level. Advocates in some states, like Ms. Riley and others in Kentucky, are trying to stiffen penalities. 
 ''Our cause is really a socioeconomic one,'' Ms. Riley said. ''People are being abused.''
 Alberto Goetzl, a forest economist who is studying the extent of domestic illegal logging for a coming report, said that without data, it was hard to prove that tree thieves were more active now than in the past. He said the issue was probably cyclical, depending on pricing, and more of a local nuisance than anything.
 ''Some people say it's worse out in the Pacific Northwest, others say Appalachia,'' Mr. Goetzl said. ''We have not been able to determine whether it's any worse in one place or another. What we have learned is that the concern about timber theft is greater than I thought before I went into this.''
 The price paid to loggers for timber varies from mill to mill, region to region, and is largely dependent on the quality and size of individual trees, and the global and domestic markets. Demand for softwoods of the Pacific Northwest like the Douglas fir, largely used in construction to frame houses, is in a slump right now because of the downturn in domestic housing starts. But the hardwoods -- used for things like high-end finishes and furniture -- are more coveted now than in recent years, particularly abroad. One top-quality black walnut tree in the Midwest, for instance, could be worth over $5,000. 
 Black walnut trees so often disappear from their owners that Keith Argow, the president of the National Woodland Owners Association, said, ''Walnut has feet,'' because the trees seem to ''just walk away.''
 Mr. Argow continued, ''We have found more and more landowners are patrolling their properties more carefully as a trend nationwide.''
 Timber thieves tend to pick the easiest trees to steal, and they most often belong to vulnerable owners, like older people or the poor -- or people who are on vacation or away from their land. Mr. Spaulding had been in the hospital for heart surgery when his trees were chopped. 
 ''A lot of people grow timber for a specific purpose; it's retirement, or a college education,'' said Dennis Mason, an investigator for the Arkansas Forestry Commission. ''Thirty or 40 good trees can be worth many thousands of dollars. But it's so easy to steal, and most people get away with it. I'd venture to say we only get 20 percent, at the most.''
 Still, since 2002, investigators in Arkansas have recovered more than $1.4 million for landowners in about 340 timber theft cases, Mr. Mason said.
 In Conneaut, Ohio, in the far northeastern corner of the state, Frederick T. Bennett, 60, is missing several black walnut and butternut trees that, he said, were about as old as he is and were planted by his father. 
 Mr. Bennett recalled watering them as a child, using three-gallon pails because he was too small to lift five-gallon containers. Before his father died, Mr. Bennett said, he made him promise not to cut those trees down.
 But last June, someone else did, bulldozing the trees and claiming they were outside of Mr. Bennett's property. 
 ''I was sickened,'' Mr. Bennett said, choking up at the thought of his father seeing the stumps. 
 The authorities would not prosecute because they could not prove intent to steal the trees, he said, and now the case is in civil court. The timber was valued at $10,000, Mr. Bennett said, but the trees were irreplaceable to his family. 
 ''There have been four generations of Bennetts that picnicked under those trees and partied,'' he said, ''and now they're gone.''

HEADLINE: The Risk of Innovation: Will Anyone Embrace It?

BYLINE: By G. PASCAL ZACHARY. 
G. Pascal Zachary teaches journalism at Stanford and writes about technology and economic development. E-mail: gzach@nytimes.com

 BODY:
THE Prius has become one of the hottest cars in America -- an amazing development, because this hybrid-electric car requires some rather large changes in how people behave.
 I learned the need for Prius-style adaptation early this month, when I rented a Prius from Budget Rent A Car in Seattle. Much to my embarrassment, I couldn't get it to go forward. Once I got going and arrived at my destination, I couldn't figure out how to put it in reverse. 
 Fortunately, another Prius owner on the premises -- they seem to be everywhere these days -- gave me a quick lesson. You start the Prius by pressing a button on the dashboard, not once but twice. To put it in drive or reverse, you manipulate a very small stick protruding from the dashboard. 
 The next morning, I awoke before dawn and started the Prius, but no matter how many times I pressed the button, I couldn't get it to move. I finally called Budget roadside assistance, and a polite man talked me back from my private technology disaster. It turns out that I had failed to tap the brake while moving the gear shifter in a certain inexplicable way.
 I don't think I can adapt to the behaviors required by the Prius. But thousands of people are, and Toyota, its maker, is reaping the benefits.
 Whether humans will embrace or resist an innovation is the billion-dollar question facing designers of novel products and services. Why do people adapt to some new technologies and not to others? Fortunes are made and lost on the answer. 
 Great innovations have foundered over human stubbornness. Consider the Picturephone, trumpeted by AT&T at the New York World's Fair in 1964 as a major technological advance. Engineers reasoned that if hearing someone's voice over the phone was terrific, wouldn't seeing a face be even better? 
 Consumers didn't think so. AT&T's Picturephone, which would have added around $90 to a person's monthly phone bill in 1974, a huge amount for the time, ''was superfluous, adding little information to voice alone, especially considering its high price,'' said Kenneth Lipartito, a professor of history at Florida International University. 
 Even today, when adding video to a phone is a trivial cost, consumers may rebel. Video-conferencing often remains an activity forced on people by their employers.
 Resistance to technology is an omnipresent risk for every innovator. Even a device as fabulously freeing as the personal computer struck some people as an abomination. In 1990, the poet Wendell Berry famously declared his perpetual allegiance to the typewriter in his essay, ''Why I Am Not Going to Buy a Computer.''
 Few people joined him, however, a reminder that rejection isn't the real specter facing new gear. Adaptable humans usually trade one technology for another, rather than reject any and all. To be accepted, innovations must deliver benefits -- enough benefits to make change worthwhile.
 ''As consumers we're constantly asking ourselves, where do we draw the line? How far do we go?'' says Mitchell Kapor, chairman of the Open Source Applications Foundation in San Francisco.
 Businesses crave a sweet spot: where the line is drawn in favor of the innovator. The late Akio Morita, founder of Sony, talked about satisfying appetites that people didn't even know they had. He achieved such a feat with the Sony Walkman, the music player introduced in 1979. While at the Lotus Development Corporation, Mr. Kapor created another such ''killer app,'' or application: the spreadsheet for the PC.
 Killer apps are sought-after innovations because people get addicted to them and make behavioral changes that might otherwise be unthinkable. ''Those who benefit from a technology adapt to its constraints and become dependent on it,'' says John Staudenmaier, editor of the journal Technology and Culture and a historian of technology at the University of Detroit Mercy.
 Dependency drives profits, the ultimate arbiter -- for some -- of an innovation's success. Look how Apple has converted the mania for the iPod into record profits -- and a record stock price. 
 IPod ''addiction'' seems benign. Yet some worry that other innovations may harbor health threats. As a result, they may be vulnerable to what Marc Ventresca, a lecturer at the Said Business School at Oxford, calls the ''frog boiling'' problem. For the frog, gradually rising heat causes no alarm -- until the water is so hot that death is imminent.
 ''Adaptation can sometimes be dangerous, but the hazard isn't apparent until it is 'too late,''' Mr. Ventresca says. 
 While people may be fearful of allowing a seductive technology to imperil them -- the ''Frankenstein effect'' -- they may also fear the consequences of not changing their ways. As the case of climate change illustrates, many consumers are enthusiastic about changing their behavior -- in this case, the way they drive cars -- if they believe that by adapting to new technologies they will save themselves and the planet. Think of the Prius again. 
 FOR technological innovators, the cash register can ring either way. They may achieve a smash-hit breakthrough, or simply make a slight improvement in a technology that humans already feel comfortable with. Most innovators no longer even try to predict human reactions to their creations.
 Henry Kressel, a partner at Warburg Pincus and a co-author of ''Competing for the Future: How Digital Innovations Are Changing the World,'' says, ''You throw technologies into the market and see what sticks.''
 The hope is that passionate ''early adopters'' will blaze a path toward mass acceptance of a new technology. Yet the truth is that no one can tell in advance which innovations people will adapt to and which will become the next example of the Picturephone. 
 Where people draw the line can be known only after the fact. Which is why innovation is always a risky -- even humbling -- business.

HEADLINE: Thinking Twice About That $400 Handbag

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO

 BODY:
IT was a retail juggernaut that swept through America's shopping malls and bedroom closets, rewriting the rules of class and consumption.
 But affordable luxury is not looking so affordable -- or sustainable -- anymore.
 During the 2007 holiday shopping season, the middle-class consumers who spent the last decade splurging on $300 saucepans and $600 scarves, tightened their purse strings in the face of slipping home prices and rising energy costs. 
 As a result, an entire economy built around aspiration is starting to collapse. Affordable luxury purveyors like Tiffany & Company, Nordstrom and Coach have experienced slowing sales and plunging stock prices, problems likely to deepen after the stock market's continued slide last week reinforced fears of a recession. 
 But one of the biggest casualties may be the illusion of wealth that millions of Americans enjoyed for years, one Burberry trench coat at a time. 
 ''You had a lot of people who graduated to a level of consumption they could not really afford,'' said Adrianne Shapira, a retail analyst at Goldman Sachs. ''Two-hundred-dollar pairs of denim were plausible when home values soared, but now $100 jeans are looking more reasonable.''
 The phenomenon earned many nicknames -- mass affluence, new luxury, masstige -- and was best summarized by the retail experts Michael J. Silverstein and Neil Fiske in their 2003 book, ''Trading Up: The New American Luxury.''
 They posited that Americans with household incomes of $50,000 and above tend to ''trade up'' to high-end products in categories like kitchen appliances or bedding that are emotionally important to them, while perhaps pinching pennies elsewhere to compensate. 
 Dozens of chains rode this masstige wave, and earned billions in the process. Coach persuaded women to buy $400 handbags when a $60 version from Macy's could have sufficed. Williams-Sonoma trained shoppers to covet a $35 stainless-steel hand-crank can opener, even though Wal-Mart sells a high-quality electric model for less than half the price. And 7 for All Mankind convinced people that they wanted a $200 pair of jeans made from the same material in a $30 pair of Wranglers.
 But trading up was always a fragile phenomenon. It rested, in large part, on consumer psychology -- a feeling of wealth derived from soaring home values and the steady growth of real income, that is, income adjusted for inflation. 
 Today, any growth in real income is all but canceled out in consumers' minds by falling home prices and rising energy costs. Michael J. Kowalski, the chief executive of Tiffany, calls this ''the wealth affect.''
 Even if people have plenty of money on paper, he said, they suddenly feel less rich. ''It is a reaction to the general economic uncertainty that everyone is feeling,'' Mr. Kowalski said.
 At Tiffany, the wealth effect translated into sluggish holiday sales of jewelry priced between $1,000 and $10,000, items aimed at what the chain calls its ''midtier luxury consumer.'' 
 Stephen I. Sadove, the chief executive of Saks Fifth Avenue, observed the same pullback in December. ''The customer who aspires to luxury is slowing down,'' he said. ''But the high end of luxury retailing remains strong.''
 So what will become of masstige if the economy actually tips into a full-blown recession? 
 Trading down, of course. Experts predict Americans will now grudgingly shift to cheaper brands for much of their shopping. For his part, Mr. Silverstein, the grandfather of trading up, is confident that consumers will pay a premium for the products that matter most to them.
 ''The trading up phenomenon is quite recession-proof,'' Mr. Silverstein said. ''It might slow. But it's way too early to say it's over.''

HEADLINE: How to Get a Cheaper Loan

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI

 BODY:
WHEN lenders issued mortgages to anyone who asked, borrowers could largely ignore their credit scores, the most important and most incomprehensible determinant of a loan's interest rate. 
 But now that banks have tightened their lending standards considerably, borrowers must sometimes search for ways to eke out a point or two more on their credit scores to qualify for loans or for more favorable rates. Mortgage professionals say that some knowledge about the scoring system helps.
 ''Sometimes, I'll tell borrowers their score, and they'll start yelling at me,'' said Debra Killian, president of the Charter Oak Lending Group, a mortgage broker and lender in Danbury, Conn., who teaches courses on the credit-reporting industry. ''And I have to explain I'm not the one who's generated the score.'' 
 The reports come from Experian, Equifax and TransUnion, credit bureaus that evaluate the financial-management abilities of millions of Americans.
 Credit-card companies, utilities and other creditors send reports to the bureaus, which rely on software from the Fair Isaac Corporation (creator of the FICO score), along with their own, to grade a borrower on an ascending scale of 300 to 850.
 The software is a black box of sorts, whose workings are known only to the companies involved. Each credit bureau will weigh certain factors differently -- the number of late payments, for example, or the number of credit-card accounts open. 
 To account for those differences during the mortgage application process, loan officers review the scores from all three credit bureaus and base their loan offers on the middle number. If a couple -- married or not -- is jointly applying for a mortgage, the loan officer will choose the middle score of the partner with the lower score.
 That score essentially dictates the loan terms that a lender offers. For instance, a borrower with a credit score of 699 will often get a higher interest rate than a borrower with a score of 700. And the higher the interest rate, the bigger the broker's commission from the lender, known in the industry as a yield-spread premium. 
 That is why, mortgage executives said, borrowers should be proactive about this part of the mortgage process. Ms. Killian of Charter Oak said borrowers should ask the broker or lender to explain how their score changes the terms of the transaction.
 Brokers buy reports from services that supply data from the three credit bureaus, and each report gives details about items that adversely affect a score.
 If a consumer wishes to challenge such items, credit bureaus will do so on the consumer's behalf, or consumers can also call or write creditors directly. Credit-repair services can also help, although people should review their terms carefully because they are popular fronts for scam artists.
 Ms. Killian said that in cases where one or two points on a credit score can have a major effect on the loan terms, borrowers can ask the loan officer or mortgage broker to request another credit report. Bureaus offer more than one type of report -- TransUnion has its traditional report and its Vantage report, for instance. A bureau may well come up with different scores for the same borrower because each report weighs various factors like recent payment history in a slightly different way. 
 Brokers can also ask the service supplying the credit bureau figures to request a second report. ''In one case,'' Ms. Killian said, ''the new score got us the two points we were looking for, and the borrower got a much better loan.''

HEADLINE: Ignoring the 800-Pound Gorilla

BYLINE: By GEORGE VECSEY. 
E-mail: geovec@nytimes.com

 BODY:
They had it. Four full years before the home run frolics of 1998, Major League Baseball included steroids in a strict proposal for drug testing. Not only that, it included amphetamines, too.
 It's not exactly a secret that a 12-page proposal to test for illegal drugs was kicking around during that lockout season of 1994. That proposal included penalties just about as tough as under the program that finally emerged only after Congress shamed labor and management in 2005. 
 Nothing happened with that 1994 proposal, for all the usual reasons: negotiation hardball, love of money, lack of curiosity. There is a human cautionary tale in the way all of us failed to address the epidemic of performance-enhancing drugs. 
 Sometimes, our instincts are more right than we know -- or want to admit. I giggled when Lenny Dykstra reported to camp in 1989 wearing King Kong's neck, but I didn't take the subject seriously for nearly a decade. So, mea culpa. Then again, what about the owners and the union?
 ''This scandal happened under your watch,'' Representative Elijah E. Cummings, Democrat of Maryland, said in ''Field of Dreams'' gravity to Commissioner Bud Selig and Donald Fehr of the players union during the Congressional hearing last Tuesday. ''I want that to sink in. It did.''
 The owners are obviously not embarrassed, because they just extended Selig's tenure through 2012, even as two stars of the past generation, Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens, face inquiries.
 Just last week, we learned that the number of players claiming to have attention deficit disorder leapt to 103, from 28, in one year. Do you think the veritable plague has anything to do with the stimulants prescribed for that condition? 
 That 1994 drug proposal was mentioned in Howard Bryant's excellent book ''Juicing the Game,'' published in 2005. Bryant describes how the owners had been gearing up for a showdown as the contract ran out in 1994, and a drug proposal was written by Rob Manfred, now the executive vice president for labor relations of Major League Baseball, but then an outside counsel with Morgan, Lewis & Bockius, a Washington law firm. 
 After somebody gave me a copy of that 1994 proposal, I asked Manfred on Wednesday why it had been written. ''We wanted to get a full collectively bargained program,'' he said, noting that baseball had had a number of players connected to cocaine in a scandal out of Pittsburgh in the mid-'80s. As for performance-enhancing drugs, Manfred said he had ''watched the issue'' in other sports, particularly track and field, in which the sprinter Ben Johnson lost his gold medal at the 1988 Olympics in Seoul, South Korea. 
 Using drug expertise from other industries, Manfred produced the 12-page proposal, ''Prevention of Drug Use and Distribution,'' which specified marijuana, cocaine, opiates, phencyclidine and amphetamines, as well as ''steroids or prescription drugs which the Player uses or possesses without a valid prescription.''
 On Wednesday, Manfred said, ''We didn't think we had a pattern with steroids'' but felt ''it would be best'' to include steroids.
 ''It's better to be ahead of the curve,'' Manfred said. ''It's easier to make a deal beforehand before people realize you have a problem.'' He quickly added that ''in my heart of hearts,'' he could not say baseball had a problem at that time. 
 In the proposal, detection would be based upon ''reasonable suspicion testing,'' which was probably never going to happen because it would involve clubs turning in their productive users. Ha! 
 The penalty for the first offense would have been treatment, followed by a 60-day suspension, then a 12-month suspension and, for the fourth offense, a lifetime ban. 
 Today's three-strikes-and-you're-out penalties are 50 games, 100 games and a lifetime ban, with periodic testing. So what took so long? 
 The 1994 proposal was also mentioned in the December report by former Senator George J. Mitchell, who drily noted: ''Officials of the Players Association said that the clubs did not appear to regard the 1994 proposal as a high priority and did not pursue its adoption vigorously. Indeed, Players Association executive director Donald M. Fehr recalled that the proposal never even reached the main bargaining table during negotiations.''
 Reached by telephone Wednesday, Fehr politely said he did not want to go back over the past. While he accurately laments the proliferation of drugs, legal and otherwise, in America, Fehr missed his chance to be a statesman. Instead, he was a labor leader -- by law, he will add. 
 When baseball resumed after the cancellation of the 1994 World Series, both sides were intent on rebuilding the product. In 1998, an alert reporter, Steve Wilstein of The Associated Press, noticed androstenedione, a legal precursor to steroids, in Mark McGwire's locker. But most of us, including myself, were slow to take it seriously. 
 At the very least, Selig has done an abysmal job of waging a public fight against drugs as a moral and health issue. There is no point in saying he should resign, because the owners obviously love him. He makes money for them -- at least until the recession takes its cuts. (How many naming-rights sponsors will go down?) Bud cannot control a recession. But as Elijah, the righteous prophet, suggested Tuesday, Selig could have done better noticing Lenny Dykstra's neck.

BYLINE: By JENNIFER FINNEY BOYLAN.

DATELINE: Belgrade Lakes, Me. 

 BODY:
 IN Maine, the catchphrase for the presidential campaign so far seems to be, ''Ayuh, stupid, it's the economy.'' Or, to use more colorful local parlance, if you don't know how hard times have become, ''you're numb'er than a pounded hake.''
 My little town -- population 4,000 -- sits on a finger of land that runs between Long Pond to the west and Great Pond to the east. At the north end of town is a general store, Day's; at the south end is another, Christie's. Between these two are a cafe, a bait shop, the Sunset Grill and a beauty shop called the Pin Curl. Not to mention some of the most beautiful scenery in the country. 
 There was a time when Mainers were justly proud of their state's status as a bellwether; it was the election of 1840 (when we went for the Whig William Henry Harrison), that gave rise to the phrase ''As goes Maine, so goes the nation.'' We haven't been that dependable in recent years, though -- having sided with Al Gore and John Kerry in the last two go-rounds. In some circles, alas, people now say, ''As goes Maine, so goes ... Bangor.''
 On a rainy Friday I spent the morning walking through town asking people whom they liked. Naturally, people mentioned all the top contenders. While at the Lazy Lab cafe, a painter lamented that Dennis Kucinich didn't stand more of a chance. Next to him, a former Romney volunteer said he was leaning toward John Edwards. At the Sunset Grill, one voter said he was hoping Mike Bloomberg would run as an independent. I found Democrats who liked Rudy Giuliani and John McCain. There were Republicans who were sorry Chris Dodd and Joe Biden had dropped out. 
 In other words, we're all over the place.
 If there's one thing Mainers do know, though, it's that the state economy is the primary issue. At Christie's, a gallon of gas is $3.19; a cup of coffee is about a dollar. ''People are having a hard time to survive, in a small town like this,'' said Pam Stone, a waitress at the Sunset Grill. 
 Over at the bait shop, Catherine Sawyer agreed about the ''financial stuff.'' The price of smelts, she said, has remained the same since last year ($8 for a dozen), but ''the price of bird seed has gone up tremendously, because of the gas crisis.'' 
 The ice fishing has been good this year; and there's the usual excitement about the annual ice fishing derby in February. The trophy fish is the northern pike, because it's big and ugly and has a row of hideous, razor-sharp teeth. 
 If my conversations are any guide, Mainers are yearning for a little more northern pike in the presidential hopefuls. ''I want substance,'' said Chuck Randall, over at the Sunset Grill. ''I want some meat and potatoes feelings, and not all this flash and glitz.''
 From what I can see, that's a feeling that's not local to Maine. 
 There were two other things that stayed with me, after a morning of talking to Mainers:
 Almost everyone intends to participate in the caucuses. 
 But not a single soul knew when they were.

 BODY:
Senator John McCain declared victory in the South Carolina Republican primary Saturday night in an address delivered at the Citadel. 
 '' Thank you, my friends, and thank you, South Carolina, for bringing us across the finish line first in the first in the south primary. It took us a while, but what's eight years among friends. It just gave us the opportunity to spend more time in this beautiful state; to talk with you and listen to you; and to come to admire all the more the deep patriotism of South Carolinians, who have sacrificed so much to defend our country from its enemies.
 My friends, I know we are facing challenging economic times, and we must be responsive to the concerns of Americans who fear they are being left behind in the global economy. But nothing is inevitable in our country. We are the captains of our fate. We can overcome any challenge as long as we keep our courage, and stand by our defense of free markets, low taxes and small government that have made America the greatest land of opportunity in the world. I have served our country all my adult life, and I am prepared for the high office I seek. I asked South Carolinians to help give me the opportunity to serve the country I love a little while longer. You have done that, and I will never forget it.
 Thank you, South Carolina, for your trust. ''

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
 When President Bush finished doing his sword dances and Arabian stallion inspections, when he finished making a speech in Abu Dhabi on the importance of freedom that fell flat, when he finished lounging in his fur-lined George of Arabia robe in the Saudi king's tent, he came home.
 Or he came to what was left of home. 
 A Washington Post cartoon by Tom Toles summed it up best: ''Great to be home,'' W. enthuses on Air Force One, heading toward the East Coast. ''Anything interesting happen while I was gone?'' Hanging on the skyline of New York is a sign reading: ''U.S.A. Now a Wholly Owned Subsidiary of Foreign Investors.''
 Wherever he went, W. seemed dazzled by the can-do spirit of the J. Pierrepont Finches of the new Middle East. ''It's important for the president to hear thoughts, hopes, dreams, aspirations, concerns from folks that are out making a living,'' he told Saudi entrepreneurs. 
 In Dubai, he commended young Arab leaders, saying, ''The entrepreneurial spirit is strong.''
 In Abu Dhabi, he marveled at the royal family's plans to build a city based entirely upon renewable energy. ''Amazing, isn't it?'' W. said. 
 You know you're in trouble when your Middle East oil pump is greener than you are. 
 Even as W. played cheerleader for Arab business, the Arabs were cleaning our clocks -- then buying them. Our addiction to oil has allowed our pushers in the Persian Gulf to go on a shopping spree to snap us up.
 Hillary Clinton was right when she said it was ''pathetic'' that President Bush had to beg the Saudis to drop the price of oil. 
 One cascading rationale he offered for invading Iraq was the benign domino theory, that bringing democracy to Iraq would sway the autocrats in the region to be less repressive.
 But when W. visited Saudi Arabia and Egypt last week, he did not have the whip hand. He could not demand anything of the autocrats in the way of more rights for women and dissidents, much less get the Saudis to help on oil production. He needs their help in corralling Iran, which has been puffed up by the occupation of Iraq.
 So he was a supplicant in Saudi Arabia. The American economy is a supplicant, too. 
 Two decades ago, we fretted that Japan was taking over America when Sony bought Columbia Pictures and Mitsubishi bought a chunk of Rockefeller Center. But they overpaid for everything.
 Now, because of Wall Street's overreaching, our economy depends on foreign oil and foreign loans to stay afloat.
 China and Arab countries have a staggering amount of treasury securities. And the oil-rich countries are sitting on so many petrodollars that they are looking beyond prestige hotels and fashion labels and taking advantage of the fire sale to buy eye-popping stakes in our major financial institutions. 
 Like the president, Citigroup and Merrill Lynch came with tin cups to Middle Eastern, Asian and American investors last week, for a combined total of nearly $19.1 billion, after the subprime mortgage debacle blew up their books.
 Citigroup, which raised $7.5 billion from Abu Dhabi in November, raised another $12.5 billion, including from Singapore, Kuwait and Saudi Prince Walid bin Talal. Merrill Lynch gave $6.6 billion in preferred stock to Kuwait, South Korea, a Japanese bank and others.
 (While the great sage Bob Rubin was advising Hillary Clinton on sound fiscal policy, he seemed to be asleep at the Citigroup switch.)
 As Warren Buffett has said, we are giving ourselves a party to feed our appetite for oil and imported goods and paying for it by selling off the furniture, our most precious assets. 
 When the president got back Thursday night from a trip that made it clear he has no clout overseas, he had to rush the ailing economy into intensive care.
 Next to the cool, strong euro, the dollar is a comparative runt in the world's currencies. The weak dollar lets foreigners snap up real estate in Manhattan. 
 It is striking that the Bush scion, who has tried so hard to do the opposite of his father, also ends up facing the prospect of a recession in his final year in office.
 Maybe if the president had spent the trillion he squandered on his Iraq odyssey on energy research, we might have broken the oil addiction. 
 Now it's a race between Iraq, stupid, or the economy, stupid, to see which one will usher out W. 
 The country is engaged in a fit of nativism and Lou Dobbsism, obsessing about the millions of Mexicans who might be sneaking across the border when billions in foreign money are pouring into Citigroup. You figure out what might be a bigger problem.
 The national boundaries that really matter are the financial ones: Who's going to own the American economy?

HEADLINE: Pump-Priming the Economy

 BODY:
After months of denial, President Bush seems to be bowing to the need to stimulate the faltering economy. He has also given up, for now, his effort to use the economy's deepening woes as an excuse to extend his tax cuts for the wealthy past their 2010 expiration date. 
 Still, Congressional Democrats face a battle with the administration to draft a final package that will quickly help those Americans most in need and provide the most economic bang for the buck. 
 Urged by testimony on Thursday by Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, Mr. Bush seems to have acknowledged that extending his tax cuts would do little to mitigate an economic slowdown in 2008 and 2009. On Friday, Mr. Bush called for a package of tax rebates and investment incentives amounting to about $145 billion -- or 1 percent of the nation's economic output -- to be rolled out as soon as possible. 
 The White House says it embraces some sound principles for an effective fiscal boost -- that they be temporary and timely, hitting the economy this year, while it is weak. But what we know of the package does not meet a fundamental requirement: that it put cash into the hands of low- and moderate-income people, who need it most and are most likely to spend it right away.
 The White House has provided few details, but in conversations with lawmakers, he mulled provisions to let businesses partly deduct new capital investments, coupled with income-tax rebates of $800 for individuals, or $1,600 for households. The idea, Mr. Bush said on Friday, was to let people ''keep more of their own money.''
 The package has obvious flaws. Research on the investment incentives provided after the 2001 recession suggest that tax cuts for businesses will not have much short-term effect on investment, providing little immediate benefit to the economy.
 Tax rebates for consumers do provide effective economic stimulus. Rebate checks sent after the 2001 recession -- $300 for qualifying individuals and $600 for families -- were spent relatively quickly, according to research, providing the economy with a shot in the arm. Twenty percent to 40 percent of the rebate was spent within three months, one study found. 
 But in its embrace of the notion that relief means letting people keep their own money, the White House's proposal excludes those who have no money to keep -- about 45 million families earning too little to pay income taxes and to qualify for a rebate. Yet these are exactly the people who should be helped, not only because of their dire need but also because they would be most likely to spend quickly whatever assistance they got. 
 There are more effective and progressive ways to provide an economic stimulus. Democrats have suggested a flat tax credit for all workers, regardless of whether they pay income taxes. To help the worst-off Americans, they have proposed extending unemployment insurance and increasing food stamp benefits.
 Fortunately, a compromise looks possible. Things have gotten so bad that the White House appears to have decided that it needs bipartisan support. Some Congressional Republicans have signaled that they could support extending unemployment insurance. Democrats should not give in on the core principle of progressivity. A plan that excludes the 45 million families who need relief the most is an inadequate relief plan.

HEADLINE: South Poll

BYLINE: By MATT BAI. 
Matt Bai, who covers politics for the magazine, is the author of ''The Argument: Billionaires, Bloggers and the Battle to Remake Democratic Politics.''

 BODY:
The campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination has thus far been marked by a heightened sense of history and optimism -- the former because its two leading candidates are pushing up against societal barriers that were once thought unmovable; the latter because Democrats feel as assured of recapturing the presidency as they have at any time since the post-Watergate election of 1976. Now it's reality-check time. After early contests in friendlier territories, the nomination fight moves this week into the heart of the Old South, where the inspiring story line of a woman dueling with an African-American will collide, at last, with another side of history. While much of the primary electorate in South Carolina comprises traditional Democrats (black voters, college-town liberals, etc.), the candidates will nonetheless encounter, in a broader way, a less-welcoming political culture in a state that hasn't voted for a Democratic nominee since Jimmy Carter. 
 You could offer a lot of reasons why Democrats have held the White House only sporadically over the last four decades, but mathematically speaking, the greatest obstacle has been the South. In signing the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Lyndon Johnson predicted that he and the Democrats were also signing away the next generation of Southern voters, and he was right; since that time, the Dixiecrat bloc that once dominated the Old South has tilted away from the party, and the only Democrats who have managed to reach the White House have been native Southerners. In 2004, John Kerry was shut out in the South and lost South Carolina by 17 points, winning only 22 percent of the white vote, according to exit polls.
 It has been in vogue throughout the Bush years for Democrats to assert that the South is unredeemable and politically unnecessary. I remember seeing Kerry speak at Dartmouth College in the days before the 2004 New Hampshire primary, when he flatly told the audience that a Democratic nominee could win the presidency without worrying about the South. (He went on to test the formula; it didn't work out so well.) Two years later, Thomas F. Schaller, a political scientist and liberal blogger, won over a lot of his fellow progressives with an entire book devoted to the premise that Democrats should ignore the South and instead focus their finite resources on the growing and more diverse states in the West and Southwest. In ''Whistling Past Dixie,'' Schaller marshaled a pile of statistics to argue, essentially, that the region's long legacy of prejudice left it hopelessly blind to the nobility of the Democratic cause.
 Other Democrats, like Mark Warner, the former Virginia governor, short-lived presidential hopeful and now Senate candidate, have argued that if the party aspires to build a real governing majority like the one it enjoyed for much of the 20th century, it will have to at least compete seriously in the South. (After all, recent history would suggest that while it is ''possible'' for Democrats to win without making any inroads in the South, it's possible only in the same way that it's possible to shoot 10 straight free throws with your eyes closed.) These Democrats insist that the party's problem isn't Southern voters but the way Northern and coastal Democrats tend to relate to them or don't. In other words, if you condescend to Southerners or simply don't show up, then it's all but impossible to erase the legacy of mistrust left over from the era of desegregation. 
 This argument seems especially relevant now. The nationwide dismay over the Bush years may be opening a door for Democrats in Southern states. What's more, as some of the sharper Democratic strategists have realized, reaching voters down South isn't only about the South. Culturally and ideologically, there isn't much that separates most Southern, independent white voters from those who live in exurban Ohio or in rural Missouri. (It was the native Southerner James Carville who famously observed that Pennsylvania was, for all practical purposes, just Alabama sandwiched in between Philadelphia and Pittsburgh.) If Democrats want to win those perennial swing states by anything other than the tiniest of margins, then they will probably have to put forth the kind of candidate and argument that will also resonate in much of the South, whether they care about the region or not. 
 The question, then, is which of the leading candidates can embody that role. Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and John Edwards have all asserted that they don't intend to write off votes the way Kerry did. Clinton has cited her successful campaigns in upstate New York to make the case that she is able to connect with farmers and factory workers despite her reputation as a polarizing figure. Obama has said that because he transcends the ideological wars of the past, he can expand the electoral map that has bedeviled recent Democratic nominees. 
 If politics were static, you would assume that Edwards would have the best profile for campaigning in the South; like Johnson, Carter and Bill Clinton, he is a native Southerner with a healthy drawl and a populist bent. But politics evolves as the generations pass, and America is not the country it was 24 years ago, when Geraldine Ferraro became the first woman on a major party ticket and Jesse Jackson first ran for president. A lot of Southerners, weary of economic and social divisions, seem eager to close one chapter of their history and open another, and no one should dismiss the idea that a black or female candidate could begin to reverse the party's long retreat from the South. How South Carolinians and other Southerners engage in this Democratic campaign may tell us something not just about the candidates and their theories of the electorate but also about the New South itself.

HEADLINE: Tax Rebate or Payment? A Policy Debate Begins

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
As President Bush and Congressional Democrats begin negotiations on a package of measures to stimulate the economy, the big fight will be over whether to put extra money in the hands of tens of millions of low-income families who paid little or no income tax last year.
 Nearly 40 percent of Americans owed no federal income tax last year, though even low-income workers paid taxes for Social Security and Medicare. While Mr. Bush has refused to disclose specifics of his $145 billion plan, administration officials and Republican lawmakers favor a proposal that would offer rebates of up to $800 for individuals and $1,600 for families -- but only if they paid that much in taxes last year. 
 For practical purposes, analysts estimate, a family of four with an income of $24,000 would receive no government payments at all, and families with incomes below $40,000 would at most receive partial rebates. But a household with an income of $100,000 or more could get back $1,600.
 ''The president again is focused on broad-based tax relief for those who are paying taxes,'' said Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. when asked at a news conference on Friday whether ''everybody'' would get a tax break. ''This is something that has worked well before, has worked in 2001, worked in 2003.'' 
 Administration officials and Republican lawmakers say it only makes sense to give tax rebates to people who actually paid taxes. 
 ''You have to be a taxpayer in order to get a tax rebate,'' said Representative Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin and a member of the House Ways and Means Committee. ''The White House is very clear that this is for people who pay taxes.''
 But Democrats are gearing up to fight that approach, arguing that a stimulus plan should put money in the hands of low-income people, both as a matter of fairness and because people who are struggling to make ends meet are most likely to spend any government payments quickly. For the purpose of jump-starting the economy, economists want people to spend extra money as quickly as possible. 
 On the presidential campaign trail, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York and John Edwards, a former senator from North Carolina, attacked the Republican approach for excluding people who need help the most. Senator Barack Obama of Illinois has already proposed a $90 billion program of rebates and supplemental Social Security payments that his aides said would reach 95 percent of workers.
 Robert Greenstein, director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal research group in Washington, estimated that under the Republican plan, as many as 65 million Americans with low or modest incomes would miss out on part or all of the payments.
 ''This approach fails on two counts,'' Mr. Greenstein said. ''It omits or partly omits those who need the help. And it omits the tens of millions of people who are living paycheck to paycheck and who would be most likely to quickly spend every dollar they can get.''
 In Washington, Democratic lawmakers and senior administration officials were working on a fast compromise, and both sides took pains not to jinx the effort. Mr. Bush refrained from insisting on any specific measures, and Mr. Paulson told top Democrats that all options were still on the table.
 Democratic aides in Congress said a compromise would have to include money for low-income people, either through tax rebates or temporary increases in antipoverty programs like unemployment benefits and food stamps. For Republicans, a compromise would mean including tax incentives for business investment -- a demand that Democratic leaders said they were open to discussing.
 The administration's preferred approach, which Republican lawmakers have already been circulating on Capitol Hill, would provide rebates by temporarily reducing the lowest tax bracket to zero, from 10 percent. The lowest tax rate applies to the first $8,000 in taxable income for individuals and the first $16,000 in taxable income for families.
 Democratic staff members on the House Ways and Means Committee said that a family of four would not be entitled to the full rebate until its income reached about $40,000. Almost by definition, the approach would exclude millions of people who were unemployed or living largely on Social Security. It could also bypass families with incomes as high as $60,000, depending on the kinds of tax credits they use to reduce their taxable incomes.
 People familiar with the discussions said Mr. Bush raised the issue in a conference call with Congressional leaders on Thursday, but he backed off from announcing specific proposals after Democrats complained that he was jumping ahead on his own.
 The Republican approach contrasts sharply with plans discussed by Congressional Democrats and Democratic presidential candidates.
 Mr. Obama's plan offers $250 in government payments to all working adults, $500 if the economy continues to worsen, and similar payments of up to $500 to people receiving Social Security benefits. His advisers estimated that the payments would reach 95 percent of all workers, and all Social Security recipients. Though the payments would be lower than those proposed by Republicans, they would reach more people. 
 Mrs. Clinton announced a similar plan on Friday that would cost $40 billion and come on top of $70 billion in new spending programs. In an interview with National Public Radio on Friday, Mrs. Clinton criticized Mr. Bush's plan for excluding lower-income citizens.
 ''These are lower-income senior citizens living on fixed incomes,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ''This would be disproportionately African-American and Hispanic families who have, on average, lower incomes than white families and would therefore not be even paying taxes.''
 But Edward Lazear, chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, said the primary goal was to stimulate growth rather than redistribute income.
 ''There are many noble goals, and there are many things that we want the government to do,'' Mr. Lazear told reporters on Friday. ''But remember that the goal that we are thinking about right now is to ensure that the economy does not slow significantly.''

HEADLINE: Ronald Reagan Is Still Dead

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
CONTEMPLATING the Clinton-Obama racial war, some Republicans were so excited you'd have thought Ronald Reagan had risen from the dead to slap around a welfare deadbeat.
 Never mind that the G.O.P. is running on empty, with no ideas beyond the incessant repetition of Reagan's name. A battle over race-and-gender identity politics among the Democrats, with its acrid scent from the 1960s, might be just the spark for a Republican comeback. (As long as the G.O.P.'s own identity politics, over religion, don't flare up.)
 Alas, these hopes faded on Tuesday night. First, the debating Democrats declared a truce, however fragile, in their racial brawl. Then Republicans in Michigan reconstituted their party's election-year chaos by temporarily revivifying yet another candidate, Mitt Romney, who had been left for dead. 
 The playing of the race card by Hillary Clinton's surrogates to diminish Barack Obama was sinister. But the Clintons are hardly bigots, and the Democratic candidates all have a history of fighting strenuously for inclusiveness. By contrast, the Romney victory in Michigan is another reminder of how Republicans aren't even playing in the same multiracial American sandbox. 
 The conservatives who hyperventilated about the Democrats' explosion of identity politics seemed to forget that Mr. Romney also dragged Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. into this campaign -- claiming that he ''saw'' his father, a civil-rights minded governor of Michigan, march with King in the 1960s. The point of Mitt Romney's invocation of the race card was to inoculate himself against legitimate charges of racial insensitivity; he had never spoken out about his own church's discrimination against blacks, which didn't end until 1978. Instead, the tactic ended up backfiring. Late last month The Boston Phoenix exposed this touching anecdote as a fraud. George Romney and King never marched together.
 I don't mean to pick on Mitt Romney -- though heaven knows it's a thriving national pastime -- but his retro persona exemplifies much of the present Republican dilemma. It's not just that the old Reagan coalition of social, economic and foreign-policy conservatives has fractured. A more indelible problem for the Republicans in 2008 is that their candidates are utterly segregated from reality as it is lived by the overwhelming majority of their fellow Americans. The G.O.P. presidential field's lack of demographic diversity by age, gender, ethnicity or even wardrobe, let alone race, is simply the leading indicator of how out of touch its brand has become.
 Mr. Romney's victory in Michigan was most of all powered by a lie far more egregious than his bogus appropriation of King. In a state decimated by unemployment, he posed before auto plants like an incongruously well-groomed Michael Moore, vowing to fight to bring back every last lost job. His plan? He'd scrap the modest new fuel-efficiency standard passed with rare bipartisan unity in Washington last month and give Detroit a $20 billion fund for energy ''research'' (not to be confused, he claimed, with a bailout).
 It's a poignant measure of Michigan's despair that some voters willed themselves to believe in Mr. Romney's preposterous antidote to the decades-long erosion of the American auto industry. It's a farcical measure of how little the other Republicans have to say about the nation's economic crunch that Mr. Romney's con job could pass for substance.
 Whatever the merits of the Democratic candidates' takes on our fiscal crisis, at least they saw the crisis coming. Though Mr. Romney officially kicked off his presidential candidacy in Michigan, he started grandstanding about the misery in that state only after all his other campaign strategies had failed and he needed a Hail Mary marketing gimmick. In his announcement speech in Dearborn last February, the lone economy he mentioned was the fuel economy of the Ramblers his father manufactured at American Motors in a distant past. 
 Among Mr. Romney's rivals, Mike Huckabee alone made affinity for economically struggling Americans his calling card. Unfortunately, Huckanomics is more snake oil. All federal taxes would be replaced by a national sales tax that despite its Orwellian name (the Fair Tax) would shift more of the burden to middle- and low-income Americans. 
 For the other Republicans, the downturn has been an occasion to recycle the mindless what-me-worry optimism of the pre-1929 G.O.P. presidents and Wall Street potentates since relegated to history's dustbin. When Maria Bartiromo, moderating a CNBC Republican debate in October, asked the candidates if the nation was heading into a recession, Fred Thompson found ''no reason'' to think so and pronounced both the near and longer-term economic future ''rosy.'' Rudy Giuliani extolled the glories of freedom and the market before promising that ''the sky's the limit.'' 
 Even the White House halfheartedly acknowledged the home-mortgage fiasco ahead of this crew. Instead, the Republican candidates have largely clung to illegal immigration as Domestic Crisis No. 1, to no particular point beyond alienating Hispanic voters.
 The election is more than nine months away, and already this obsession is blowing up in the G.O.P.'s face with non-Hispanic voters, too. Far from proving the killer app of 2008, illegal immigration is evaporating as a national cause. In the nearly identical findings of The New York Times/CBS News and ABC News/Washington Post polls this month, it ranks near the bottom, the top issue for a mere 4 to 5 percent of voters. The economy (at 20 to 29 percent) leads in both surveys, closely followed by the total of those picking some variant of ''war'' and ''Iraq.'' 
 As if it weren't crazy enough for Republicans to lash themselves to the listing mast of immigration, they are nonplayers on the issues that do matter most to voters. The more the economy tanks and steals Americans' attention from a relatively less violent Iraq, the more voters learn that the Republicans have little to offer beyond their one-size-fits-all panacea of extending the Bush tax cuts. 
 To voters who do remember Iraq, the supposed military success of the ''surge'' does not accrue to the Republicans' favor either. Quite the contrary. As every poll shows, most Americans still want the troops home ASAP. Republican declarations that we are ''winning'' merely leads many voters to a logical conclusion: Why not let the Iraqis take over the remaining triage so we can retrieve the $10 billion a month in taxpayers' money that might benefit us at home? This is why even the poll-driven Mrs. Clinton, who has been the most cautious and ambiguous of the Democratic candidates about a withdrawal timetable, dramatically changed course to expedite her Iraq exit strategy in Tuesday night's debate.
 Thanks in part to the Giuliani campaign's one triumph -- turning 9/11 fearmongering into a running late-night talk-show gag -- the usual national-security card is no longer so easy for Republicans to play. Conservatives not in denial see the crackup ahead. ''All the usual indicators are dismal for Republicans,'' wrote George Will last week, concluding that ''Nov. 4 could be their most disagreeable day since Nov. 3, 1964,'' when Barry Goldwater lost 44 states.
 But might some Republican still win, especially if the Democrats are ultimately divided by race, or by the Clintons, or by their own inane new debate about Reagan? Conceivably, but only if someone besides Ron Paul is brave enough to break out of the monochromatic pack.
 That contender would seem to be John McCain. For all the often irrational anger directed at this conservative by his long-time antagonists in his own party, he is the sole G.O.P. candidate who resisted the immigrant vigilantes. He might have done better in Michigan, where he spoke honestly about the grim prospects for the auto industry, had he backed up his prognosis with remedies less glib than a vague pledge to retrain workers at community colleges. Education policy of any kind is M.I.A. on the McCain campaign Web site. 
 His ardor for the war, however, has not done him in. He handily won the growing Republican antiwar vote in both Michigan and New Hampshire. Apparently many still remember that Mr. McCain was bitterly against President Bush before he was for him. 
 Exitpolls find that among voters in Republican primaries, as many as half have turned against the president. David Frum, the onetime Bush speechwriter, laments in his provocative new book ''Comeback'' that by 2008 his former boss ''had led his party to the brink of disaster'' and cost it ''a generation of young Americans.'' 
 At the last Republican debate, the candidates invoked Reagan nearly three dozen times and Mr. Bush just once. ''I take my inspiration from Ronald Reagan and George Herbert Walker Bush,'' said Mr. Romney on his Michigan victory night, in a typical example of the candidates' circumlocutions about the incumbent president. 
 This, too, is laughably out of touch with reality as practiced in most American living rooms. Imagine if Mr. McCain's Straight Talk Express stopped taking detours around the one figure who unites 60-plus percent of the populace in ire. Imagine if he started talking straight about how he'd clean up the White House mess. That might at least break the ice with the vast majority of voters who look at the G.O.P. presidential field and don't see Ronald Reagan so much as also-rans for ''The Bucket List.''

HEADLINE: What Would Obama Say?

BYLINE: By ASHLEY PARKER

 BODY:
AT the Radisson Hotel in Nashua, N.H., Jon Favreau sipped Diet Coke and munched on carrot sticks and crackers to pass the time. His boss, Senator Barack Obama, wandered in and out of the room.
 Finally, results from the New Hampshire Democratic primary started coming in, surprising everyone. Hillary Clinton was pulling past Senator Obama, who had won the Iowa caucuses only five days earlier. 
 Mr. Favreau, the campaign's 26-year-old head speechwriter, found himself in the hotel lounge with less than three hours to revise what was to have been a victory speech. What made it particularly strange was that his words were being challenged. Mrs. Clinton had helped turn her campaign around by discounting Mr. Obama's elegant oratory, saying, ''You campaign in poetry, but you govern in prose.'' 
 ''To be honest,'' Mr. Favreau said, ''the first time I really stopped to think about how it felt was when he started giving the speech. I looked around at the senior staff, and they were all smiling. And I looked around the room and thought, 'This is going to be O.K.'<0>'' 
 Mr. Favreau, or Favs, as everyone calls him, looks every bit his age, with a baby face and closely shorn stubble. And he leads a team of two other young speechwriters: 26-year-old Adam Frankel, who worked with John F. Kennedy's adviser and speechwriter Theodore C. Sorensen on his memoirs, and Ben Rhodes, who, at 30, calls himself the ''elder statesman'' of the group and who helped write the Iraq Study Group report as an assistant to Lee H. Hamilton. 
 Together they are working for a politician who not only is known for his speaking ability but also wrote two best-selling books and gave the much-lauded keynote speech at the 2004 Democratic National Convention.
 ''You're like Ted Williams's batting coach,'' Mr. Favreau said.
 But even Ted Williams needed a little help with his swing. 
 ''Barack trusts him,'' said David Axelrod, Mr. Obama's chief campaign strategist. ''And Barack doesn't trust too many folks with that -- the notion of surrendering that much authority over his own words.''
 When he first met Mr. Obama, Mr. Favreau was 23, a recent graduate of the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Mass., near where he grew up. Mr. Obama was rehearsing his 2004 convention speech backstage, when Mr. Favreau, then a member of John Kerry's staff, interrupted him: the senator needed to rewrite a line from his speech to avoid an overlap. 
 ''He kind of looked at me, kind of confused -- like, 'Who is this kid?'<0>'' Mr. Favreau recalled.
 Mr. Obama became his boss the following year. Mr. Favreau had risen to a job as a speechwriter on the Kerry campaign, but by then was unemployed. He was, he said, ''broke, taking advantage of all the happy-hour specials I could find in Washington.''
 Robert Gibbs, Mr. Obama's communications director, had known Mr. Favreau during the Kerry campaign, and recommended him as a writer. 
 Life was relatively quiet then, and Mr. Obama and Mr. Favreau had some time to hang out. When Mr. Obama's White Sox swept Mr. Favreau's beloved Red Sox three games to none in their American League 2005 division series, the senator walked over to his speechwriter's desk with a little broom and started sweeping it off. 
 Mr. Favreau also used this time to master Mr. Obama's voice. He took down almost everything the senator said and absorbed it. Now, he said, when he sits down to write, he just channels Mr. Obama -- his ideas, his sentences, his phrases. 
 ''The trick of speechwriting, if you will, is making the client say your brilliant words while somehow managing to make it sound as though they issued straight from their own soul,'' said the writer Christopher Buckley, who was a speechwriter for the first President Bush. ''Imagine putting the words 'Ask not what your country can do for you' into the mouth of Ron Paul, and you can see the problem.''
 Many Democratic candidates have attempted to evoke both John and Robert Kennedy, but Senator Obama seems to have had more success than most. It helps that Mr. Obama seems to have the elan that John Kennedy had, not to mention a photogenic family. 
 For his inspiration, Mr. Favreau said, ''I actually read a lot of Bobby'' Kennedy. 
 ''I see shades of J.F.K., R.F.K.,'' he said, and then added, ''King.''
 Not everyone is so enamored. Mr. Obama excels at inspirational speeches read from a teleprompter before television cameras, critics have noted, but many of his other speeches on the campaign trail have failed to electrify. 
 Ted Widmer, a historian at Brown University, said that Mr. Obama's speeches ''were perfect for getting to where he was early in the race, but I think now that we're in a serious campaign, it would be helpful to hear more concrete proposals.''
 ''There's more to governing, there's more to being president, than speechwriting,'' he added.
 Mr. Favreau said that when he is writing, he stays up until 3 a.m. and gets up as early as 5. He hasn't slept for more than six hours in as long as he can remember, he said.
 Coffee helped him through the Iowa caucuses. Two days before the victory there, he walked across the street from the campaign's Des Moines headquarters and cloistered himself inside a local cafe.
 He and Mr. Obama had talked about the post-caucus speech for about 30 minutes, settling on a theme of unity and an opening line: ''They said this day would never come.''
 ''I knew that it would have multiple meanings to multiple people,'' Mr. Favreau said. ''Barack and I talked about it, and it was one that worked for the campaign. There were many months during the campaign when they said he'd never win. And of course there was the day that would never come, when an African-American would be winning the first primary in a white state.''
 In discussions about the speech, the issue of race never came up, Mr. Favreau said. But, he added, ''I know I thought about it.'' 
 As Senator Obama's star has risen, so has Mr. Favreau's. In New Hampshire, Mr. Favreau stood in the back of a gym watching his boss campaign when Michael Gerson, a former speechwriter to the current President Bush, introduced himself. He complimented him on the Iowa victory speech.
 The campaign staff has started teasing Mr. Favreau about his newfound celebrity. Not that it's any great pickup line. Mr. Favreau, who said he doesn't have a girlfriend, observed somewhat dryly that ''the rigors of this campaign have prevented any sort of serious relationship.'' 
 ''There's been a few times when people have said, 'I don't believe you, that you're Barack Obama's speechwriter,'<0>'' he went on. ''To which I reply, 'If I really wanted to hit on you, don't you think I'd make up something more outlandish?'<0>''
 He does have other things to worry about. ''Can you get through this process and keep the core of yourself?'' Mr. Favreau asked. ''You know, we're finding out. I'm confident he can. And I think I can, too.''

HEADLINE: Shrinking Pains

BYLINE: By WHITNEY TERRELL. 
Whitney Terrell is the author of the novels ''The King of Kings County'' and ''The Huntsman.''

DATELINE: Kansas City, Mo. 

 BODY:
 ON the blustery afternoon after the New Hampshire primaries, my father and I took a walk, looking for ''investments.'' 
 ''If you see something you like, don't panic,'' said my father, a real estate agent who hadn't sold a house in six months. ''It's not going anyplace.''
 I live in Missouri's Fifth Congressional District, right on the fault line between blacks and whites in Kansas City, demarcated by Troost Avenue. Everybody here is aware of race -- and racial segregation -- as an everyday fact of life. All you have to do is look at the houses for sale in my area: a three-bedroom, two-bath house east of Troost was going for $57,000. The same size house two blocks west of Troost was listed at $157,000. 
 You would think that this kind of disparity would make the Fifth District fertile territory for Barack Obama. But so far, that isn't clear. One reason is that our congressman, Emanuel Cleaver, has endorsed Hillary Clinton -- a godfather-like blessing, since people around here both pray and vote at his church.
 But another seems to be a combination of economics and distrust. The best deals on my father's list were foreclosures -- $19,000 and under. With bad times brewing, black voters seem worried they can't afford to vote for Mr. Obama's optimism and lose. ''I like him,'' said one of my longtime neighbors. ''I just don't think anybody's going to let him be president.''
 On the other hand, Claire McCaskill, our first-term Democratic senator, just endorsed Mr. Obama. Ms. McCaskill is blonde, country and white; Mr. Cleaver is dapper, urban and black. So much for the politics of identity.
 Among Republicans, meanwhile, there seems to be a general ''House of Usher'' feeling of decay. A few years back, John Ashcroft was attorney general, Roy Blunt was majority whip in the Congress, and Mr. Blunt's son Matt was elected to the governor's mansion at age 33. The party had the trappings of a dynasty. 
 Now, with Mr. Ashcroft gone and Mr. Blunt's father in the minority, the governor has turned to ''rooting out'' illegal immigrants with the help of Lou Dobbs and our highway patrol. But he hasn't inspired his base -- or at least not my neighbor's roofing contractor.
 ''I used to be a real hard-core Republican closed-border type,'' the roofer told me the other day, as we watched one of his employees haul a slab of asphalt shingles up a ladder that he'd braced in the back of a Nissan pickup. ''I just think a guy like that, who works as hard as he does, why shouldn't he have a chance to be happy?'' 
 The locker room at my gym has started to sound like a focus group -- albeit one where, as in the New Hampshire opinion polls, the women's vote is underrepresented. ''Obama by eight points, Romney by five,'' one steam-room pundit assured me the night before that contest.
 But the flat screens over our elliptical trainers advertise hamburgers, not Huckabees. My only contact with a campaign has been on my answering machine: ''Press 1 if you have a favorable opinion of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.'' 
 As my father and I tramped home through a light snow the other night, I wondered if I'd be smart to buy a rental house now -- or just a sucker. ''That's the problem with living in the Show Me State,'' he said. ''Sometimes there's nobody there to show you anything.''

Senator John McCain staved off a spirited challenge by Mike Huckabee to win the South Carolina primary on Saturday, exorcising the ghosts of the attack-filled primary here that derailed his presidential hopes eight years ago.
 Mr. McCain's victory here, on top of his win earlier this month in New Hampshire, capped a remarkable comeback for a campaign that was all but written off six months ago. In an unusually fluid Republican field, his aides said they hoped the victory would give Mr. McCain a head of steam going into the Jan. 29 Florida primary and the nationwide series of nominating contests on Feb. 5.
 ''It took us a while, but what's eight years among friends?'' Mr. McCain said at a boisterous victory celebration that broke out into shouts of ''Mac is back! Mac is back!''
 Mr. McCain did best among voters who said experience was the most important quality in a candidate, among those who said the Iraq war and terrorism were their top concerns and among the state's veterans, who made up a quarter of the vote. He ran about even with Mr. Huckabee, who pressed a populist message here, among the many voters who said their top concern in the election was the economy. He also continued to draw strong support from independents. 
 Mr. Huckabee's loss in a Southern state with a strong turnout of religious voters was a setback to his campaign as it heads toward potentially less hospitable states. 
 Nearly 60 percent of the voters in South Carolina identified themselves in exit polls as evangelical Christians, a group that was heavily courted by Mr. Huckabee, a former Arkansas governor and Baptist preacher. While Mr. Huckabee captured 4 in 10 of their votes, Mr. McCain also made inroads with the group, capturing more than a quarter of their vote. 
 The South Carolina primary has accurately predicted the Republican presidential nominee since 1980, and since 1988 it has often played a decisive role. The McCain campaign sought to highlight that history here this week, but he is still left facing a scrambled field of opponents, including Mitt Romney, whose lopsided victory in the lightly contested Nevada caucuses Saturday gave him his second win in a week. He defeated Mr. McCain in the Michigan primary on Tuesday.
 In his concession speech, Mr. Huckabee praised Mr. McCain for running ''a civil and a good and a decent campaign'' and vowed to battle on. 
 ''The reason that I want to encourage you tonight is to remind you that politics -- and particularly this year, more than perhaps any other -- this is not an event,'' he said. ''It is a process. And the process is far, far from over.''
 With 94 percent of the electoral precincts reporting, Mr. McCain had 33 percent of the vote, Mr. Huckabee 30 percent, Fred D. Thompson 16 percent, and Mr. Romney 15 percent. 
 The distant third-place finish was a severe blow to the candidacy of Mr. Thompson, an actor and former Tennessee Senator. He had been counting on a strong showing in a Southern state to revive his fortunes, and gave a rambling speech in which he urged his followers to ''stand strong.''
 The primary also narrowed the field of Republican candidates, leading Representative Duncan Hunter of California to drop out of the race.
 For Mr. McCain, the victory was especially sweet. His presidential hopes were dealt a crippling blow here eight years ago when he lost to George W. Bush after a primary battle that was marked by vicious personal attacks on Mr. McCain and his family. This time his campaign aggressively responded to the few attacks that were leveled at him in fliers and phone calls, both debunking them and using them to gain sympathy for Mr. McCain. The campaign also enjoyed the support of the political establishment in the state.
 ''You and I are aware that for the last 28 years, the winner of the South Carolina primary has been the nominee of our party for president on the United States,'' he said at a victory rally at the Citadel, a military school, where he kissed his mother, Roberta, 95. ''We have a ways to go, my friends, and there are some tough contests ahead, starting tomorrow in the state of Florida. But, my friends, we are well on our way tonight.''
 The campaign now heads to Florida, where Mr. McCain faces another challenge: Rudolph W. Giuliani, who has been advertising heavily and campaigning nearly nonstop there. His campaign hopes a win there will rescue his faltering candidacy. 
 The South Carolina contest was crucial for Mr. McCain and Mr. Huckabee, who were trying to build on earlier victories -- Mr. McCain in New Hampshire and Mr. Huckabee in Iowa -- to establish their dominance in the still-muddled Republican field.
 Mr. McCain had predicted that he would win the primary here, and, although many polls were close in the last week, he campaigned as if he were the strong front-runner, pressing his twin issues of military strength and fiscal conservatism. He never disparaged or engaged Mr. Huckabee, even in the face of a spate of phone calls and radio advertisements attacking him by independent groups supporting Mr. Huckabee.
 Mr. McCain's campaign tried to portray him as the one candidate ready to be commander in chief, a message it sought to drive home with a big rally at an aircraft carrier museum here and a visit Saturday morning to a company that makes armored vehicles for the troops. He traveled with current and former senators and prominent state officials.
 Mr. Huckabee, meanwhile, tackled South Carolina as if it were his home ground, with a populist patter and a calculated sense of the state's stress points. He leaned heavily on secular themes in his public appearances -- delivering an I-feel-your-pain economic message -- but was very much the ordained Baptist minister on the airwaves, embracing the evangelical belt in the Midlands and western hills. The one commercial he ran over the last three days focused on his Christian beliefs.
 Mr. Huckabee also emphasized his Southern origins in Greenville and Spartanburg, urging listeners to ''support a Southerner who has run a Southern state.''
 And he seized on several issues to try to galvanize conservative voters. Although he made a point of being compassionate toward illegal immigrants as the governor of Arkansas, he took a resolutely anti-immigration stance in South Carolina, sending out a mailing on the subject and becoming the first presidential candidate to sign a pledge promising not to give amnesty to illegal immigrants.
 Mr. Huckabee also dove into the murky waters of Southern cultural identity politics, raising a dormant issue Thursday when he said that it was not his business whether the state chose to fly the Confederate battle flag over the Capitol. (The state removed the flag in 2000.) That same day an apparently unaffiliated group, Americans for the Preservation of American Culture, began running radio advertisement criticizing Mr. McCain and Mr. Romney on the issue, while praising Mr. Huckabee. 
 The McCain campaign grew concerned Saturday morning when voting problems were reported in Horry County, which includes Myrtle Beach, where they had expected strong support. 
 Gary Baum, a spokesman for the South Carolina State Election Commission, said voting machines in 15 or 20 of the county's 118 precincts were not properly set up for voting, forcing voters to use emergency paper ballots. Mr. Baum said there might have been some precincts that did not have enough paper ballots.
 The McCain campaign said it had received reports that some voters were turned awayfrom the polls without voting.
 Mr. Baum said that the voting machines worked, but that elections workers had not properly cleared test votes, rendering it impossible to open the machines for actual voting. He said workers were sent to the precincts to fix the machines.
 Despite pouring millions of dollars into South Carolina, Mr. Romney struggled in the state. So he abandoned the state to compete in the lightly contested caucus in Nevada.
 Mr. Romney's runaway victory in Nevada was powered to a large degree by Mormons, according to an entrance survey reported by The Associated Press. Mormons made up a quarter of Republican caucus participants, and 95 percent of them voted for Mr. Romney.

HEADLINE: Is the New Supply Side Better Than the Old?

BYLINE: By AUSTAN GOOLSBEE. 
Austan Goolsbee is a professor of economics at the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business. He is advising the campaign of Senator Barack Obama of Illinois for the Democratic presidential nomination. E-mail: goolsbee@nytimes.com

 BODY:
THE presidential campaign has brought back to the fore the vexing question of how much to tax high-income Americans. For the most part, the arguments have run strictly along party lines. 
 The leading Democratic contenders would allow President Bush's tax cuts to expire for the very well-off -- those earning more than, say, a quarter-million dollars a year -- on the grounds of restoring balance and raising money. 
 All the major Republican candidates have called for extending the Bush tax cuts indefinitely, and several advocate several hundred billion dollars in additional high-income cuts -- on the grounds that this would help the economy grow. 
 The Republicans have not been shy about claiming the old mantle of supply-side economics, proclaiming that tax cuts will pay for themselves by getting people to work harder or to start their own companies. 
 In some circles, supply-side economics fell into disrepute because it didn't seem to work. After all, the budget deficit exploded when the government cut taxes in the 1980s and again in the 2000s, and it disappeared when the government raised taxes in the 1990s.
 But many critics have missed important research by some very prominent economists that has revived some supply-side ideas, giving them an aura of academic respectability. The leading Republican candidates do not advertise their academic influences, but they appear to have adopted these ideas. 
 The work of the new supply-siders shies away from the old claims that low taxes will generate an explosion of entrepreneurship or extra hours on the job. Instead, it just looks at the data. When top marginal rates fell, as they did under President Ronald Reagan in 1981 and 1986 or under President Bush in 2001 and 2003, taxpayers whose rates declined the most reported the biggest increases in income in the following years. The supply-side advocates attribute those gains to tax cuts and argue that the Laffer curve -- which suggests that some tax cuts can pay for themselves -- may live yet. 
 Some of the most important research was done by Lawrence B. Lindsey, former head of the National Economic Council under President Bush and now the senior economic adviser to the Republican presidential contender Fred D. Thompson. But the origins of the current debate, and the seriousness with which it is taken in academic circles, largely center on the work of the Harvard economist Martin Feldstein. 
 Professor Feldstein, head of the National Bureau of Economic Research, is perhaps the godfather of modern public-sector economics and is often cited as a potential Nobel laureate. The former chairman of President Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers, he has always been known for his conservative views. He has brought more comprehensive data to bear and has made the most influential case; if you accept the evidence he offers, progressivity in the tax code appears very damaging. Raising taxes on high-income people seems to make the economy much less efficient and raises little revenue. 
 As he put it in a 2006 interview published in a magazine of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, when you raise top marginal rates, ''it shows up as lower taxable income.'' He added: ''A reduction in taxable income, whether it occurs because I work less or because I take my compensation in this other form, creates the same kind of inefficiency.''
 But for all the renewed interest in supply-side ideas, the politicians espousing these views have missed three important points that have come out of the continuing academic debate. 
 First, the impact of high-income tax cuts depends on how much additional income a person can keep. When President John F. Kennedy cut top marginal rates to 70 percent from 91 percent, take-home pay more than tripled for these taxpayers, to 30 percent from 9 percent. That is a big difference. By contrast, letting the Bush tax cuts expire so top rates rise to 39.6 percent in 2011 from 35 percent, cutting the take-home share to 60.4 percent from 65 percent, hardly seems the stuff of tax revolution. 
 Second, other research has shown that the new supply-side movement missed a fundamental shift over the last 30 years -- the dramatic, disproportionate rise in the compensation of high-income people. The new supply-siders have confused this shift with the impact of tax cuts. 
 An example illustrates the point: Emmanuel Saez, a professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley, has compiled data on the incomes of the very rich from 1913 to 2006. Using his data, my calculations show that in the four years after top marginal rates were cut in 1981 and 1986, and in the three years after the rate cut of 2003, average real salaries (subtracting inflation) for the top 1 percent of earners grew 18.8 percent, 22.5 percent and 17.4 percent. But for the bottom 90 percent of earners over those periods, the average salary changes were 2.6 percent, minus 0.3 percent and minus 0.1 percent. A supply-sider might see this as evidence of the growth power of cutting top rates. 
 But the data also show that incomes at the top have been growing rapidly regardless of what happened to tax rates. In the four years after the increase in top marginal rates in 1993, average salaries grew 18.7 percent among the top 1 percent of earners and less than 0.1 percent for the bottom 90 percent. 
 Seeing the same pattern when taxes rose as when they fell indicates that tax cuts weren't responsible. It suggests that cuts for high-income taxpayers likely gave windfalls to those whose incomes were already rising sharply because of broader market forces. 
 Third, recent research has documented that much of what the new supply-side economics attributed to tax cuts was really just the relabeling of income. Sometimes the increase in personal income was matched by an equal and opposite decrease in corporate income. At other times, increases in personal income turned out to be a result of corporate executives shifting the timing of their year-end compensation from a high-tax year to a low-tax year. 
 Shifts like these have nothing to do with supply-side economics. The academic debate continues, but thus far, the new Laffer curve has looked more like a fleeting figment of economic imagination.
 That is sad, because it would be great if we could cut taxes and raise revenue at one stroke. Alas, the research suggests that we will have to pay for high-income tax cuts the old-fashioned way -- by actually cutting spending or just busting the budget.

HEADLINE: The Education of Ben Bernanke

BYLINE: By ROGER LOWENSTEIN. 
Roger Lowenstein is a contributing writer to the magazine and the author of ''While America Aged,'' to be published in May by the Penguin Press.

 BODY:
Ben Bernanke's first exposure to monetary policy was reading the works of Milton Friedman, the Nobel laureate. That was 30 years ago, when Bernanke was a graduate student at M.I.T., and he has been studying central banking ever since. By the time President Bush nominated him to run the Federal Reserve, at the end of 2005, Bernanke knew more about central banking than any economist alive. On virtually every topic of significance -- how to prevent deflationary panics, for instance, or to gauge the effect of Fed moves on stock-market prices -- Bernanke wrote one of the seminal papers. He championed ideas for improving communications between the Fed -- whose previous chairman, Alan Greenspan, spoke in riddles -- and the public, believing that clearer guidance about the Fed's aims would help the economy run more smoothly. And having devoted much of his career to studying the causes of the Great Depression, Bernanke was the academic expert on how to prevent financial crises from spinning out of control and threatening the general economy. One line from his ''Essays on the Great Depression'' sounds especially prescient today: ''To the extent that bank panics interfere with normal flows of credit, they may affect the performance of the real economy.'' 
 Bernanke, who came to the job with a refreshing humility -- a desire to be less an oracle like Greenspan than a plain-speaking technocrat --faces exactly this sort of crisis now. Ever since last summer, a meltdown in financial markets has led to daunting losses in the banking industry and throughout Wall Street. Despite having written extensively on how to deal with such episodes, Bernanke has thus far been unable to reinstill a sense of confidence. His faith in modern forecasting models notwithstanding, he failed to foresee that the sudden rise in homeowner defaults, which triggered the crisis, would have such far-reaching effects. And the monetary medicine that he has prescribed, including some of the very tools that he lovingly detailed in his research, have yet to produce a turnaround. 
 At the same time, Bernanke's attempt to improve the way the Fed communicates has misfired and often left investors confused, partly because he has repeatedly shifted course over the future direction of interest rates. His hero, Milton Friedman, is said to have warned against an indecisive Fed acting like a ''fool in the shower'' fumbling with first the hot water and then the cold. Bernanke has gotten close. Perhaps worst of all, he has failed to persuade investors that the Federal Reserve, which was formed in 1913 for the very purpose of halting market panics, is up to the job. ''Bernanke is seriously behind the curve,'' says David Rosenberg, chief North American economist for Merrill Lynch, one of many critics who maintain that the Fed has not responded to the crisis with sufficient vigor. 
 For Bernanke, who is now 54, it has been an education unlike any at M.I.T. And yet there is a case to be made that he has made many more right moves than wrong ones. The current crisis is a hangover from a half-decade of heady speculation in both housing and home mortgages and does not necessarily admit to a speedy fix. Moreover, it has fallen into Bernanke's lap just as oil prices have spiked to a record $100 a barrel, the dollar has hit an all-time low against the euro and unemployment has ticked upward. None other than Alan Greenspan has said that constellation of problems facing Bernanke is tougher than anything he experienced in the 18 years that he held the job. 
 Many observers, including Lawrence Summers, the former Treasury secretary, as well as a group of bearish stock traders, say the United States may already be sinking into a recession. The rise in unemployment reported two weeks ago stoked those fears. The White House has started talking about proposing relief. And just recently, Bernanke sent the clearest signal yet that the 17-member Federal Open Market Committee (which governs the Fed's interest-rate policy, and over which Bernanke presides) would cut interest rates when it meets at the end of the month. In a speech, Bernanke warned that ''the downside risks to growth have become more pronounced,'' a gloomier assessment of the economy than he had given previously. 
 Bernanke also has strong reasons to worry, however, about easing rates too much. Inflation has failed to fall as the Fed expected. (In fact, lately it has been rising.) Also, lower interest rates induce foreigners to switch out of dollar-denominated investments like Treasuries and into currencies with higher yields. Thus, any rate cut would tend to escalate the stampede out of the dollar. 
 Perhaps the last Fed chief to face such a difficult one-two punch of inflation and slowing growth was Arthur Burns, who was also the last academic to hold the job. President Richard Nixon, concerned that high unemployment could cost him re-election in 1972, told Burns to concentrate on revving up the economy. ''No one ever lost an election on account of inflation,'' Nixon confidently told him. Burns did as he was directed. An eventual result was runaway inflation and, for Burns, a legacy of failure. 
 Bernanke is aware that he holds the same potential for influence as Burns -- which is to say he has a profound ability to affect the political landscape this year. Polls show that the economy is now the most important issue to voters in the presidential election (more important even than the war). A recession would seem to be a clear repudiation of President Bush's policies and, by extension, the Republican Party. Those who know Bernanke, however, say he is not motivated by politics. ''He wants to be known as a great central banker,'' says Mark Gertler, his close friend and an economics professor at New York University. ''Those with the worst reputations are the ones who helped politicians.''
 A wage-and-price spiral similar to that in the 1970s would not only be a political nightmare for the Republicans, it would also be a crushing blow to Bernanke's reputation as a Fed chief. And with oil and food prices going through the roof, inflation is already a worry. The consumer price index surged 4.3 percent over the past 12 months -- more than twice the inflation rate that Bernanke has delineated as the upper bound of his comfort range. (The widely watched ''core'' rate of inflation, which does not include volatile food or energy prices, is not as high as the overall rate, but it, too, has edged higher than Bernanke would like.) 
 ''I think Bernanke is in a very difficult situation,'' Paul Volcker told me. Volcker was the Fed chief who preceded Greenspan and who conquered, painfully, the great inflation of the 1970s and early '80s. (He was chairman from 1979 to 1987.) ''Too many bubbles have been going on for too long,'' Volcker added. ''The Fed is not really in control of the situation.''
 This past fall, as markets and sometimes the world seemed to be tumbling all around Bernanke, I met him in his office for a mostly off-the-record chat. We sat at a coffee table from which I could make out a Bloomberg terminal at his desk, some framed bills from the first series of Federal Reserve notes, his certificate of nomination by President Bush and shelves of economics books. I returned for a second visit a month later for lunch in his private dining room (Bernanke ordered turkey and steamed vegetables) and followed up, at Bernanke's suggestion, with a third and final interview, this time by phone. 
 Bernanke has a serious manner, befitting a scholar who once expected to spend his entire career in academia. He is shy and seemed faintly ill at ease, stiffly folding his arms while we talked; his hand trembled slightly when he gave me one of his books. He answered questions with an absence of emotion but with a torrent of carefully worded fact. 
 ''It's been a challenging economic situation,'' he granted, ''and also a difficult, rather tenacious set of problems in credit markets. However, I have the advantage of having a terrific committee'' -- the Federal Open Market Committee -- ''and strong staff support, and I think we have a good hold and understanding of the situation.'' 
 Behind the modesty and blandness of such remarks, Bernanke is uncommonly thoughtful and also resilient. He was late to recognize the severity of the subprime mortgage crisis, which intensified when European banks experienced credit problems in August, but he has dealt with it deliberately and creatively since then. With more than a million households facing the possibility of home foreclosure in the next year, he will need all of his resourcefulness and more. ''Every central-bank governor goes through tests of some sort,'' says Stanley Fischer, the governor of the Bank of Israel and the man who was Bernanke's thesis adviser at M.I.T. ''Usually, the gods oblige by providing a test early on.'' Bernanke's exam looks like a doozy.
 The Fed is facing two distinct threats -- an apparent slowing of the economy over the intermediate term and a short-term market panic that has caused lenders (both banks and investors) to tighten credit lines, putting a squeeze on banks and other institutions that rely on short-term borrowing. 
 To ease the immediate crisis, the Fed has made credit more available through the so-called ''discount window,'' where it lends to private banks. Among other things, the Federal Reserve Bank is a bank -- actually a group of banks with branches around the country. Lending at the discount window is one way that the Fed fulfills its unstated mission, which is to be the banker of last resort in times of crisis. 
 The Fed also has two formal missions that are codified in law: to promote ''maximum employment'' (thus its duty to head off recessions) and, of course, to maintain a stable purchasing power, which is generally interpreted as keeping the inflation rate at a tolerable level. There is a general notion that the Fed has vast powers over the economy itself. This is an impression enhanced by Greenspan's Delphic pronouncements (anyone so inscrutable must have been pulling all the strings, or so it was tempting to believe). As Bernanke notes, the public has high expectations for what the Fed can do. Actually, it has very little influence over most of what makes the economy tick, like improvements in productivity, educational levels or whether commodity prices are trending higher or lower and so forth. 
 The Fed's principal power is its control over the supply of money. You can think of the Fed as the banker in a national game of Monopoly. Normally, everyone gets $200 when they pass ''Go,'' but when business conditions slump, the Fed can give the economy a boost -- much like hiking the ''Go'' rate to $300. Or, if the prices of the little green houses and red hotels are rising too swiftly, it can hand out less money. 
 Of course, the Fed doesn't really hand out money. Its principal monetary lever is something called the federal funds rate, which is the rate that private banks charge one another for overnight loans. 
 The Federal Open Market Committee cannot ''set'' the fed funds rate by fiat; when it wants to, say, lower the rate, which as of this writing was 4.25 percent, it directs the New York Fed to inject cash into the system. The New York Fed lends money to major dealers in government securities, taking Treasuries as collateral. (Conversely, to tighten rates, the New York Fed borrows money.) This power to expand the money supply is unique. If one bank purchases bills from another, there is no net change in the banking system's liquidity. Only the central banker, the Fed, can create new money. 
 The fed funds rate does not directly affect rates on car loans or leveraged buyouts or anything else. But when the fed funds rate eases, it's an indication that the Fed has added liquidity to the system. Since the only thing banks can do with liquidity is lend it out, a flush banking system will act like a healthy heart, pumping credit into the economy. 
 During the Volcker era, the Fed conducted policy by adding or subtracting money until the total of bank reserves and checking accounts (what is commonly referred to as the ''money supply'') reached a desired level. But with innovations in the financial system, like brokerage checking accounts, the lines between ''money'' and other financial assets blurred, and counting the money supply became too difficult. 
 So Greenspan switched the Fed's methodology. Now it simply monitors the interest rate. If it wants to ease the rate, for instance, it keeps adding liquidity until banks react by reducing overnight rates to the target level. 
 During the first years of the new century, Greenspan lowered the fed funds rate to 1 percent, which was exceptionally low. Low rates were partly an attempt to revive the economy after the dot-com fiasco. In an illustration of how one bubble seems to beget another, however, the Greenspan rate cut greatly stimulated the housing industry. In particular, since adjustable-rate mortgages are determined by short-term interest rates, low rates paved the way for the explosion in ARMs, the very mortgages that lately have been defaulting at an epidemic pace. 
 As demand for mortgages swelled, banks began to engage in highly dubious lending practices, including issuing mortgages without verifying the income of borrowers. The Fed, which apart from its monetary role is also one of the federal agencies that regulates banks, was warned that standards were slipping. Greenspan, however, ignored the warnings, and the speculative lending continued, reaching a peak during Bernanke's first year. Thus, in both of its main areas of responsibility -- monetary and regulatory policy -- Fed laxity has seemingly contributed to the current mess. Bernanke deflects such criticisms, partly because he maintains that the mortgage fiasco had many fathers and partly because he has a scholar's disdain for perfect-hindsight-type judgments. 
 Bernanke has also shown his academic bent in how he runs the Fed. He has democratized interest-rate policy by giving the members of the Open Market Committee more of a voice. Bernanke's collegial style worked at Princeton, where he taught. But as the point man for the U.S. economy in a time of crisis, perhaps the Fed chief should be more commanding, suggests Alan Blinder, a former Fed vice chairman and a former Princeton colleague. 
 The shadow of the czarlike Greenspan lingers over Bernanke, and as Greenspan has been promoting his memoirs and has otherwise been keeping visible, it is unlikely to go away. Greenspan was known to insist on unanimous support from committee members at critical junctures, to assure the country of the Fed's resolve; Bernanke has not. Somewhat embarrassingly, he has suffered dissents on both ends of the spectrum. In October, a committee member voted against a Bernanke rate cut; in December, one dissented in favor of a bigger cut than Bernanke wanted. 
 Under Bernanke, the various Open Market Committee members have felt freer to speak their minds, and they have done so. This free speech has sometimes sounded cacophonous; the president of the Philadelphia Fed has clamored for a more hawkish policy, the Boston Fed for a dovish one. (In Fed parlance, hawks want to tighten rates; doves favor easing them.) Not surprisingly, Wall Street has found this dissonance confusing. Bruce Kasman, chief economist at JPMorgan Chase, insists that several times in recent months the market hasn't heard what the Fed is saying. 
 One of Bernanke's Open Market Committee colleagues admits that he worries about the extent to which ''democracy,'' however admirable, has dulled the Fed's aura and, perhaps, its ability to lead. On the other hand, Bernanke has held the group together (committee members respect him enormously), and the wide diversity of their opinions points to Bernanke's greatest strength, which is teasing out a consensus. ''He is very good at hearing what everyone else has to say -- of summarizing the discussion and then making his own observations,'' says Charles Plosser, the president of the Philadelphia Fed and a hawk on the committee. ''Does he persuade? He listens very carefully. He summarizes. Then he tries to shape what we should do.''
 The Federal Open Market Committee is an unwieldy and archaic body in the best of times; it includes seven Fed governors in Washington (at the moment there are only five) and the presidents of the Fed's 12 regional banks, which are dispersed in cities like Richmond and Cleveland, in the country's industrial centers circa 1913, when the Fed was founded. 
 This hydralike form is a result of the country's abiding fear of concentrated financial power. Congress twice set up central banks in the early years of the republic but let their charters lapse. Throughout the 19th century the country frequently experienced banking panics. After the Civil War, the United States adopted a gold standard, but without a central bank, the amount of money in circulation was fixed according to the available supply of gold -- a rigid structure that the economy was outgrowing. The demand for credit was variable. For instance, it was heavy in the fall when the crops came to market.
 In 1907, the U.S. suffered a brutal recession in which thousands of banks failed. The panic subsided only when J. P. Morgan Sr., then 70 and semiretired, personally rescued the stock exchange. Financiers realized that America needed a public lender of last resort: a central bank. 
 Paul Warburg, the scion of a German-Jewish banking family, was frustrated by the primitive financial system of the United States, his adopted home, and he formed a tentative alliance with Nelson W. Aldrich, the powerful chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. In 1910, Aldrich, Warburg and a group of other bankers met in secret on Jekyll Island, off the coast of Georgia, to write a plan for a central bank. Reporters were told they were going duck hunting. 
 The public was highly suspicious of financiers, especially East Coast financiers, and the Federal Reserve was consciously designed to allay their fears. The regional Fed banks were to be semiautonomous, and they were chartered with their own boards, whose members were drawn from the local communities and a majority of whom could not be bankers. Political authority was vested in Washington; the Fed's capital, however, was contributed by private banks all over the country. 
 In its early decades, the Fed had the ability to provide an elastic currency, but was unwilling to use its power to add liquidity except to support an influx of gold, or to finance so-called ''real bills'' -- meaning paper backed by industrial and agricultural goods. In the '30s, the Fed followed this principle into catastrophe. The head of the Philadelphia Fed lamented, in the midst of the Depression, ''If we were to expand now we would be putting out credit when people don't need it.'' He was warning against the very tonic -- a little extra liquidity -- that might have allowed businesses to start investing money and hiring workers. The Fed did expand the money supply in the mid '30s, and a recovery ensued, but it contracted too quickly, and business collapsed again. 
 Early scholarship blamed the Depression largely on Wall Street speculators, who were thought to have fueled overexpansion by businesses. Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz, however, fingered the Fed for failing to adequately expand the money supply as the economy contracted. That view is now widely accepted, and Bernanke's scholarship added a dimension by emphasizing the pivotal role of banking panics in aggravating the monetary failure. For Bernanke, the Depression was the unique laboratory for learning his craft. As he is fond of saying, ''If you want to learn about seismic activity, you study earthquakes, not tremors.''
 Bernanke updates Bush and Vice President Cheney several times a year, but he prizes his political independence. Unlike Greenspan, he has avoided taking positions on economic issues that do not relate to the Fed's mission. (An exception is his affirmation that he ''believes in the laws of arithmetic,'' a none-too-subtle rejection of the Bush ideology that championed deficit-spawning tax cuts.) 
 Tension with the White House was long part of the Fed chief's job description, largely because the bank's dual mandate (fighting inflation and promoting growth) was seen to be in conflict with itself. No president wants inflation, but most want high interest rates even less. Franklin D. Roosevelt wanted to finance World War II with cheap money, and Henry Morgenthau Jr., his Treasury secretary, simply directed the Fed to buy Treasury bills at a fixed rate of 2.5 percent. This kept rates flat, but led to inflation after the war. 
 The Fed was liberated from the Treasury in a famous accord in 1951. William McChesney Martin Jr., who was appointed Fed chairman that year, battled Harry Truman and successive presidents to establish the prototype for an independent Fed chief. It was Martin who proclaimed that the chairman's job was to ''take away the punch bowl just as the party gets going'' -- in other words, to raise interest rates when a booming economy threatened to cause inflation. And it was Martin who created the quasi legend that Fed chiefs could decide an election. He tightened rates in the latter part of 1959, triggering a recession that began in April 1960. Nixon, the incumbent vice president and Republican presidential nominee that year, blamed Martin for sabotaging his chances in November.
 Martin ran into even tougher pressure from Lyndon B. Johnson, who tried to browbeat him into easing rates. One version of what occurred, according to Richard Fisher, the current head of the Dallas Fed, who has studied the history, is that ''Lyndon took Martin to his ranch and asked the Secret Service to leave the room. And he physically beat him, he slammed him against the wall, and said, 'Martin, my boys are dying in Vietnam, and you won't print the money I need.' '' Martin ultimately caved. By the time he retired, in 1970, inflation was a worrisome 6 percent. Soon after, President Nixon told Burns to promote maximum employment. In fairness to Burns, he was laboring under the unforgiving strictures of an academic model known as the Phillips curve, which held that low inflation and economic growth were incompatible opposites. If you wanted to raise employment, you had to permit more inflation. And that's what Burns did. 
 By the late '70s, inflation was as much a psychological condition as an economic one. As prices rose, unions scored automatic cost-of living hikes, and so businesses raised prices even more. With inflation in double digits, Jimmy Carter finally nominated Volcker, an aloof, 6-foot-7 career public servant, who seemed to garble much of what he said through a half-chewed cigar. From the intelligible part, it was clear that Volcker intended to break the inflationary cycle. Volcker tightened the money supply so much that the fed funds rate soared to 20 percent. This led to a brutal recession, which was especially tough on workers and businesses in interest-rate-sensitive industries like real estate. ''It's no fun raising interest rates,'' Volcker admitted. Idle builders were so enraged that some sent him two-by-fours in the mail. High interest rates took a terrible toll on President Carter. In September 1980, with Carter and Ronald Reagan in a close race, Volcker administered the coup de grace by hiking the discount rate. A decade later, President George H. W. Bush blamed Alan Greenspan's tight money policy for his own defeat.
 For Bernanke's generation, the great inflation served as a bookend to the 1930s. It was an object lesson on the dangers of creating too much liquidity. Once again, Milton Friedman changed the profession's understanding, this time by deciding that, in the long run, the Phillips curve was wrong. Printing money (or as Friedman famously quipped, dropping bundles of bills from a helicopter) would spur the economy only temporarily. At first, as the money supply expanded, businesses would hire more workers and produce more goods. The economy would be ''tricked'' into operating at a higher gear. But after a while, workers would insist on wage hikes, and companies would jack up prices. The higher prices would cool off the economy again. So the net result of printing money would be just inflation -- no gains in production. In the long term, neither the Fed nor anyone could spur an economy to grow faster than its ''natural rate'' -- which is determined by all those other factors: productivity, population changes, technological advances, demand for exports and so forth. 
 Thus the dictum that inflation would lead to jobs was out. According to the new thinking, low inflation is consistent with, and even a prerequisite for, reaching whatever the economy's potential is. That means that Fed chiefs and presidents are on the same side. Bill Clinton bought into the idea, which is to say he broke with precedent and left Greenspan alone. Only in the very short term -- say, when a stimulus is needed -- are the Fed's two mandates in conflict. Of course, since elections are decided in the short term, the potential for political infighting remains.
 To Bernanke, the political dimensions of the job came as a mild shock. The day we met, he had come from breakfast with Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson Jr.; the day before, he met with a congresswoman. (The Fed is a creature of the Congress, and Bernanke must take care not to alienate it.) A few months back, when Senator Christopher Dodd invited Bernanke and Paulson to discuss some ''current issues,'' the senator, who was then running for the Democratic nomination, staged a news conference for a score of media members whom he had, conveniently, also invited. This is the sort of thing they don't train you for at M.I.T.
 Bernanke grew up in the small town of Dillon, S.C., at the tail end of the segregation era (in high school he wrote a schoolboy's novel about whites and blacks coming together on the basketball team). His father and his uncle ran a local drug store. Folks trustingly called them Dr. Phil and Dr. Mort. Ben, who skipped first grade, was obviously smart from the get-go. He played the saxophone, just as Greenspan did, and waited tables two summers and worked construction another. The Bernankes were observant Jews, and Ben's folks fretted when he got into Harvard that if he strayed from home he might wander from his religious teachings. It was never a risk. Judaism is important to Bernanke, though, as with other personal subjects, he does not discuss it. As a doctoral candidate at M.I.T., he blossomed into a star, and at the tender age of 31 he received a tenured position in the economics department at Princeton. 
 His academic research was steeped in the increasingly sophisticated discipline of econometrics, which uses computer models to simulate (and predict) the economy. By contrast, Greenspan often relied on his hunches. The difference is partly generational, but Bernanke is clearly more comfortable working with mathematical formulas than with anecdotal examples. (One looks in vain in his Depression writings for stories of banks that failed or of workers who lost their jobs.) 
 At Princeton, as a self-deprecating, tweedy professor, he discovered a talent for leadership and became department chairman. (He also served two terms on the local school board.) The Princeton economics faculty is roughly as cohesive as the various ethnicities of the former Yugoslavia, with the principal cleft being between the ''empiricists'' and the ''theoreticians.'' Department meetings were so contentious that two professors stopped speaking to each other. Bernanke eased the tension and also raised the department's profile, chiefly by making it plain that he was listening to all sides. Burton Malkiel, himself a former chairman, says: ''I thought I was pretty darn good, and Ben was the best chair we ever had, and for the reasons that actually inform his current job. He was extraordinarily good at working diverse viewpoints.'' 
 In Princeton, where he and his wife, Anna, a Spanish-language teacher, reared two children, Bernanke evidenced an ambition that surprised his colleagues, and perhaps himself. Bernanke is exceptionally methodical; he once told Alan Blinder, his Princeton colleague, that you can learn a lot about people by noting when they fish their car keys from their pocket; Bernanke does so as he leaves the office, long before he reaches his car. He is also determined. He and Alan B. Krueger, another colleague, were once waiting in Newark airport for a flight to Boston. A thunderstorm rolled in, and the flight was delayed. Krueger suggested renting a car. Bernanke, who had a fear of flying, told him, ''No, I promised myself if I got to the airport, I'd get on the plane.'' 
 While at Princeton, Bernanke wrote policy-oriented papers that raised his profile in Washington. One Bernanke idea was a direct response to the market's frustration with Greenspan, who refused to be tied down on what his inflation objective was. Bernanke maintains that if the Fed is clear about its policies, the public will tailor its behavior accordingly. For instance, if the Fed can demonstrate that it has the fortitude to snuff out inflation, individual businesses will be less likely to worry that their costs will rise, and thus less apt to raise their prices. Following this logic, Bernanke and two colleagues proposed that the Fed become more transparent and publicize an explicit inflation target. 
 In 2002, President Bush asked Bernanke to become a Fed governor. When the White House called, Bernanke happened to be in California, in the midst of an editing session with Robert Frank, a Cornell University economist with whom he was writing a textbook. Frank, who had been working with Bernanke for two years, said, ''What's Bush doing appointing a Democrat?'' Bernanke said, ''Actually, I'm a Republican.'' Bernanke rarely discusses his politics, and he tends to look at issues through a nonideological lens. 
 Being a Fed governor was a low-profile job, especially with Greenspan making all the decisions. But Bernanke delivered a series of often-provocative speeches (albeit in a monotone) that made him visible. In one speech, he presented an alternative, less worrisome explanation for the trade deficit. In another, he gave an overview of the Open Market Committee, whose job he likened to driving a car with a foggy windshield and an unreliable speedometer. As he put it, ''Not a vehicle for inexperienced drivers.'' In yet another, he discussed his personal transition from academic to policy maker, which he said was eased by the fact that the Fed relies on econometric formulas that ''feel comfortably familiar.'' 
 But as governor, Bernanke made a small contribution to a problem that would blossom in a big way on his watch. In the aftermath of the 2001 recession, inflation was at its lowest level in decades. Though consumer prices were rising, Bernanke feared a possible bout of deflation -- the potentially devastating phenomenon in which prices drop, leading to lessened business activity and then still lower prices and so forth. This occurred during the Depression and also in Japan in the 1990s. 
 Bernanke's argument provided a major element of support to Greenspan for keeping interest rates low. (To what extent he influenced Greenspan is hard to determine.) Both men were proponents of the risk-management approach to central banking, which argues in favor of taking out ''insurance'' to minimize even small risks -- in this case, the risk of deflation. The deflation never occurred. It's possible that it would have occurred had rates not been kept low, but in any case, Bernanke must be regarded as one of the intellectual authors of the low-rate policy that fed the housing bubble. 
 Bernanke is also firmly opposed to the notion that central banks should raise rates to prick bubbles in the stock market or elsewhere. In a paper written at the height of the dot-com mania, in late 1999, Bernanke and his friend Gertler argued that it is virtually impossible to identify a bubble before it pops. Many Wall Streeters dismiss this out of hand. Robert Barbera, the chief economist at ITG, remarked of 1999, ''A child of 4 had to know it was a bubble.'' Regardless, Bernanke maintains, the interest rate is too blunt a tool for addressing a narrow sector of the economy like tech stocks or even housing. Indeed, Bernanke says he believes that the Fed's actions to cool off stock-market speculation in 1929 contributed to the Depression and was a grievous error. This view remains highly controversial. Asset bubbles are bound to burst, and various foreign central bankers argue that when they do, the economy suffers and people lose jobs. Ignoring them is hardly without risk.
 When Bernanke was nominated to be the Fed chief, a meltdown was not on many people's radar. He was easily confirmed and pressed ahead on one of his main goals: to make the Fed more transparent. The Fed now reports more frequently, and also more exhaustively, on the economy. But he learned that ''transparency'' is a double-edged virtue. A few months after his February 2006 confirmation, at the annual White House correspondents' dinner, he told the CNBC anchor Maria Bartiromo that markets had misinterpreted his testimony in Congress as dovish. When his comments were reported, stock and bond markets tanked. Since then, the chief has spoken with more care, even among his friends. 
 Bernanke has discovered that even standard communication with the public -- not just off-the-cuff remarks -- can be fraught with peril. In recent years, a highly watched futures contract has developed that enables investors to bet on the outcomes of Open Market Committee meetings rather like Las Vegas bookmakers laying odds on the Super Bowl. The result is a weird hall of mirrors. Investors scrutinize the every utterance of Fed officials and vote with their dollars, whereupon the committee must either fulfill investors' expectations or risk a market crash. Though the committee members that I talked to (half of the current group) denied that they feel obligated to ratify the fed funds futures, none dispute that it is a factor. ''There is excessive emphasis on reading the entrails of the Federal Reserve,'' grumbles Fisher, the Dallas Fed chief. ''We get put on a table and sliced open.'' 
 The Open Market Committee has eight regularly scheduled meetings a year. The week before the members gather, they are sent the ''green book,'' with the staff's economic outlook, and also the ''blue book,'' with a menu of policy options. The other governors, whose offices are down the hallway from Bernanke's, typically know which way the chairman will be leaning. But the bank presidents, who generally do not confer between meetings, often arrive in Washington with no firm idea of what Bernanke wants. The group assembles around a massive, 27-foot Honduran-mahogany table in the conference room, which adjoins the chairman's office, and at 8:30 a.m. the room falls silent, a side door opens and Bernanke enters.
 After briefings from the staff, the members go around the table as if it were a Princeton seminar, each expounding on his or her view of the economy (transcripts of Bernanke meetings are running much longer than those under Greenspan). The bank presidents give an idea of conditions around the country, and the governors tend to coalesce around Bernanke's view. In Greenspan's era, the chairman led off by giving a lengthy disquisition of his outlook and policy recommendations. Every member had a chance to speak after him, but the pressure to agree with the maestro was daunting. In a profound switch, Bernanke now presents his views last. 
 The committee also consults academic formulas that derive the theoretically ''correct'' fed funds rate according to the level of inflation and other economic indicators. The most famous of these formulas, known as the Taylor Rule, correctly predicts the decisions of the Federal Open Market Committee about 85 percent of the time. Bernanke disputes the idea that he could be replaced by a computer, but to some extent, the success of modern economics has downsized his job.
 At least this seemed to be the case until last summer. The housing meltdown has defied the forecasting abilities of the Fed's 220 crack economists, computers and all. As late as May, Bernanke gave a speech in which he opined that ''the effect of the troubles in the subprime sector on the broader housing market will likely be limited.'' 
 It has proved to be anything but. The country's banks have admitted to mortgage-related losses of almost $100 billion, and the full extent of the damage, as homeowners continue to default, is not known. As the crisis unfolded last summer and fall, Bernanke repeatedly faced a devil's choice. He could cut interest rates and risk inflation and a run on the dollar and, at the same time, be seen as bailing out people and institutions who made bad bets on subprime mortgages. Or he could do nothing and run the risk that the troubles in housing would leach into the general economy, causing people to lose jobs and possibly a recession. No decision could be made in isolation, since every move would be reflected in that hall of mirrors. And it would take time to see the effect of each decision because, as Bernanke never tires of pointing out, monetary policy works with a lag. The Open Market Committee can never know until well after the fact -- until, say, a recession occurs -- whether it has made the wrong move. 
 Soon after Bernanke's speech in May, two hedge funds organized by Bear Stearns reported huge mortgage-related losses. Credit markets were suddenly jittery. When the committee met on Aug. 7, many expected it to give markets a little relief by easing the fed funds rate, then at 5.25 percent. 
 The committee voted to hold rates firm. It hotly debated, however, what to say in its statement. Some members wanted to signal that the committee considered an economic slowdown to be the greater risk. Markets, well-versed in Fed-speak, would interpret that to mean that a rate cut might be in the offing later. Bernanke maintained that inflation was still the greater risk, and he prevailed. 
 Two days later, France's biggest bank, BNP Paribas, was forced to freeze three investment funds because of mortgage-related losses. By day's end, Countrywide Financial, a leading purveyor of cheap loans during America's mortgage boom, would announce that ''unprecedented disruptions'' in markets could jeopardize its financial condition. This triggered a liquidity crisis. Banks were paying as much as 6 percent for overnight money -- far more than the official Fed rate of 5.25 percent. It was a moment with depression overtones: banks were hoarding liquidity.
 Bernanke, who had canceled plans for a vacation to Myrtle Beach, S.C., was now confronting the specter of a financial implosion of the sort he had so often written about. Although he knew the experience of the 1930s in his sleep, he was, in truth, unfamiliar with the exotic mortgage instruments that were failing now. Bernanke has no ego about such matters, and he consulted extensively with Timothy Geithner, the president of the New York Fed, as well as with Kevin Warsh, a fast-rising 37-year-old Fed governor and former investment banker at Morgan Stanley, whose unofficial role is to keep tabs on Wall Street. He had also forged a close relationship with Donald Kohn, his vice chairman, who has been with the Fed for 32 years and has a deep understanding of the institution and its abilities. 
 This unofficial war cabinet deliberated in a series of urgent telephone conversations about how to respond. On Friday, Aug. 10, the New York Fed pumped $38 billion into the markets, several times as much as on a normal Friday. Meanwhile, some of the governors, as well as William Dudley, a former Goldman Sachs economist and now the markets chief of the New York Fed, were canvassing C.E.O.'s, bank executives, traders and the like. Warsh, who was dialing contacts from his Wall Street days, was alarmed by what he heard. A source he described as a ''hedge-fund billionaire'' told him that credit assets weren't trading; people didn't want them at any price. ''Markets weren't functioning,'' he says. ''That is very dangerous for a central banker to hear.''
 Bernanke, a fan of brainstorming sessions, began to raise alternatives with his more market-savvy colleagues. Meanwhile, the stock market plunged 6 percent in a week. The central bankers were still looking for a golden mean -- a way to arrest the particularized distress of banks without overheating the economy in general. On Aug. 16, in a special meeting convened by telephone, Bernanke led the Fed in just such a two-pronged effort. They cut the discount rate (for lending to banks) but left the fed funds rate unchanged. The Open Market Committee's statement, however, seemed to leave room for a cut in the future. And in the regular meeting of mid-September, they did cut the fed funds rate -- by a hefty half-point. Markets were momentarily calmed. 
 But the pattern resumed: Fed action followed by a respite in the crisis followed by new turmoil and renewed pressure on the Fed. One bank after another -- Citigroup, then Merrill Lynch, then Morgan Stanley -- reported massive subprime losses. More disquietingly, although the fed funds rate was a half-point lower, various other interest rates -- the ones that people and institutions actually borrow at -- hadn't moved by as much. This meant that the Fed's rate cut hadn't worked: credit conditions had not really eased. 
 Of particular concern to Bernanke, prices of seemingly sound credit instruments (like jumbo mortgages, which were not experiencing unusual default rates) plunged, and credit for corporate acquisitions evaporated. Clearly, the subprime crisis could no longer be regarded as a little problem of Wall Street or even of the housing industry. Securities backed by subprime mortgages plummeted, but securities backed by other, more stable assets also weakened. When specific problems breed generalized selling, central bankers get nervous. 
 On Oct. 31, as the Open Market Committee gathered, the Commerce Department reported that in the third quarter, the economy grew at 3.9 percent, a surprisingly robust clip. Americans were still buying cars; factories were churning out goods. The news solidified the feeling of the committee hawks that they should hold rates firm. But Bernanke -- ever the believer in tailoring policy to conditions as they are forecast, and not just as they are -- figured that the economy was bound to weaken. The committee cut the rate by a quarter-point. Minutes of the meeting would describe it as a ''close call,'' suggesting a significant amount of internal disagreement. 
 As if to forestall criticism that the Fed had bowed to markets, its statement said ''the upside risks to inflation roughly balance the downside risks to growth'' -- a clear indication that no more cuts were anticipated. Still, Jim Cramer, the high-voltage CNBC stock tout, gloated, ''The Fed has got your back,'' implying gleefully that the Fed would protect investors at all costs. The Economist charged that the chief was a ''pushover'' for Wall Street, and The Wall Street Journal opined that the Bernanke Fed had become a ''Pavlovian'' slave to the market.
 The Fed's dance with the futures market is a pressure-packed aspect for Bernanke, who knows that investors stake millions of dollars every day on what the chairman will do, and also react to it with the shortest-term horizon imaginable. But Bernanke cannot ignore the futures market, as tempting as that might be. He was reared on the academic theory of ''rational expectations,'' which posits that for monetary policy to work, the market and the Fed must each have a clear idea of where the other is going. Investors have to watch the Fed, but the Fed also has to take the pulse of investors. 
 In November, Wall Street began to agitate for a third rate cut. Bernanke and Kohn, the Fed's vice chairman, gave speeches late in the month, indicating that they, too, were adjusting their economic outlook downward, because of repeated signs that bank credit was tightening. But when the rate cut came, in December, it was only a quarter-point instead of a half. Markets went ballistic: the Dow Jones average plummeted 300 points, and traders interpreted the committee's moderate stance as a betrayal. Paul McCulley, a managing director at Pimco, a big bond-trading firm, accused the Fed of ''breaking a covenant.'' Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Economy.com, complained that the Open Market Committee's press release, a waffling statement citing the ''uncertainty surrounding the outlook,'' read as if it were the product of a committee.
 Committee members dispute the notion that Bernanke doesn't lead, though it's assuredly more of a group endeavor than it was in the past. As Bernanke told me, ''It's a consensus-based system . . . with a leader. It's not that I dictate the answer, but I have to be comfortable with the outcome of the process, and as chairman I aim to shape a process that produces the best outcome.'' 
 What about the charge that the Fed is simply bailing out Wall Street? Bernanke invariably insists that the Fed is not concerned with investors per se. However, as he noted in August when central bankers gathered in Jackson Hole, Wyo., ''developments in financial markets can have broad economic effects felt by many outside the markets.'' 
 When Wall Street shudders, the Fed pays attention -- but only, various Fed governors argued to me, because Wall Street's angst is a symptom of real or potential economic problems: in this case, a credit crunch and an economic slowdown.
 In late December, Bernanke announced two new initiatives: an auction to lend money to banks (the discount-window loans did not seem to be working) and a proposal to tighten mortgage regulations, which would ideally reduce the odds of another housing bubble down the road. But history will no doubt judge him on how effectively he deals with this housing meltdown. 
 There is plenty of room to quibble with the Open Market Committee's various decisions, but viewed from a distance, the individual moves and even the directional shifts seem less important. By cutting rates by a total of one point since August, Bernanke has clearly moved toward a policy of stimulus. Perhaps unconsciously, he has mimicked the directive of Irving Fisher, one of the United States' first great economists, who likened the task of central bankers to that of steering a bicycle: ''Turn the wheel slightly, and if that is not enough, you turn it some more, or if you turn it too much, you turn it back.'' 
 Such an approach can work in normal times. Indeed, the United States has spent only 16 months of the last quarter-century in recession -- a vast improvement over previous eras. The recent period has been called the Great Moderation; growth cycles have evened out, and inflation has abated in almost every country around the globe. 
 But will it work now? The Fed faces not only the twin demons of recession and inflation but also the specter that further rate cuts would cause foreign investors -- who own more than $2 trillion of U.S. debt -- to bail out, sending U.S. interest rates soaring. That, combined with the steadily worsening housing slump, could make for a long and nasty recession. And it would mark the end to the Great Moderation.
 Perhaps the Great Moderation has been the result of good luck. Or perhaps it has been because of improved management skills --business learning not to overstock inventories, for example. Bernanke has written that it is something else. He sees it as a result, in large part, of better monetary policies. He says that central bankers have finally learned how to guide economies -- not with mystique but with economic science. If that is so, we will not need a wizard behind the curtain anymore, only intelligent engineers who can steer markets to a promised land of rational expectations. To prove that he is right, Bernanke will need to minimize or, if possible, avoid the looming recession that looks ever more likely. It will not be easy. Bernanke's education has just begun.

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY

DATELINE: CHARLESTON, S.C. 

 BODY:
With his victory in South Carolina on Saturday, Senator John McCain of Arizona has accomplished what no other Republican presidential candidate has been able to do this year: he has captured two competitive contests. Not incidentally, this one was in the state that effectively sank his campaign in 2000.
 In almost any other year, a victory like this -- particularly in a state with a history of backing the eventual Republican nominee -- would send the winner hurtling down the road toward the nomination. 
 But perhaps not this year, and perhaps not this candidate. 
 At the very least, Mr. McCain's victory has helped him slow the rise of one of his main rivals, Mike Huckabee of Arkansas, who had looked to South Carolina, with its sizable base of evangelical Christians, as fertile ground for his appeal. After winning in Iowa, Mr. Huckabee has now lost three successive primaries.
 Also on Saturday, Mitt Romney won the largely uncontested Nevada caucuses, giving him at least the claim of having won two contests in a row. On a more practical and potentially more meaningful level, he also captured more delegates on Saturday than Mr. McCain did.
 Given that Mr. McCain's candidacy was almost declared dead a few months ago, his comeback has been impressive. But so far he has benefited from a campaign calendar that could not have been better tailored to his political needs. His first two victories came in New Hampshire and South Carolina, where independents, who often seem more enthusiastic about Mr. McCain than members of his party do, are permitted to vote in the primaries. 
 The terrain from here is markedly different, starting Jan. 29 in Florida, where the Republican primary is open only to Republicans.
 ''He still has significant skepticism that he has to overcome in the Republican base,'' said Gary L. Bauer, who sought the Republican presidential nomination in 2000 and is not endorsing anyone at this time. ''The real test will be how well he can secure the Republican base as we head toward Super Tuesday.'' Mr. Bauer added, ''On balance, in most states, to get the nomination you've got to do very well among registered Republicans, and that is going to become increasingly important as other candidates drop out of the race.''
 An exit poll in South Carolina offered evidence of the challenge Mr. McCain faces: 8 in 10 of the voters in the primary described themselves as Republicans, and just 3 in 10 of them voted for Mr. McCain. The finding suggests what Mr. McCain's rivals were saying Saturday night: that he might not have won without the help of voters outside his party.
 The outcome here came on a day when Democrats in Nevada awarded Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton her second consecutive victory over Senator Barack Obama. But the campaigns immediately began squabbling about the definition of a victory as Mr. Obama claimed that in the end, he would gain more delegates from the contest.
 Mr. Obama, of Illinois, and Mrs. Clinton, of New York, have increasingly been viewing the coming contests as a long-running battle for delegates. No longer do Democrats see much chance of either candidate stringing together a few quick victories and consolidating the support of the party. The possibility of building steam that carries from one contest to the next seems much in question.
 The Republicans are facing a similar situation, and view the race in much the same way. Mr. Romney, a former governor of Massachusetts, fared poorly in South Carolina on Saturday, despite having made a major investment of time and resources in the state before leaving and effectively conceding it earlier in the week. But Mr. Romney won the caucuses in Nevada on Saturday and, as his aides and other Republicans were quick to point out, gained more delegates there than Mr. McCain did here.
 ''Romney may come out ahead today; he is going to be ahead in delegates,'' said Sara Taylor, a former White House political director who has not endorsed a candidate in the race. 
 South Carolina may help narrow the Republican field somewhat. Fred D. Thompson's back-in-the-pack finish leaves his candidacy in doubt. Should Mr. Thompson, a former Tennessee senator, leave the race, fewer candidates would be vying for the support of traditional social and economic conservatives.
 But the Republican race remains in flux. Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City who came in nearly last here despite an early investment of time, has been campaigning heavily in Florida while everyone else has been here. He will face his first head-to-head test there and can ill afford a defeat.
 The critical question for Mr. McCain now is whether a candidate who has alienated so many Republicans and conservatives over the years can put together the kind of coalition needed to win his party's nomination. His main opening comes from the nature of the competition; all the other candidates are flawed in one way or another in the eyes of the Republican base. ''McCain is helped because it is still a crowded field that is not resolved, and he is helped because independents have been able to vote,'' said Alex Castellanos, a senior adviser to Mr. Romney.
 ''As we go forward, the race may winnow itself, and there are going to be more closed primaries -- and neither of those are good for him,'' he said.
 Mr. McCain's support for the war in Iraq, a potential liability for so long, became a bragging point for him -- especially in South Carolina, with its large population of people with ties to the military -- amid evidence that the increase in troop strength had added stability in Iraq. But by every indication, the focus of the campaign is shifting from the war and national security to the economy, an issue that is not one of Mr. McCain's strengths. While his rivals have been proposing a variety of short-term tax breaks to address the economic slowdown, Mr. McCain has emphasized cutting federal spending, an approach at odds with accepted thinking about how best to give the economy an immediate lift.
 Even as the votes were being cast in South Carolina, Mr. Giuliani was in Florida offering a taste of how he was going to go after Mr. McCain there, reminding voters that Mr. McCain had voted against President Bush's tax cut plan ''not once, but twice.''
 Independent voters are a powerful force in American politics, and Mr. McCain's clear appeal to them goes to the heart of what has been one of the arguments of his supporters: that he may be the strongest candidate his party can put up against Mrs. Clinton this year. But their voice is going to be diminished as Mr. McCain and the rest of the field heads into the crush of contests over the next two weeks. 
 Florida is his first barrier. And other delegate-rich states -- including Arizona, California, Connecticut, Delaware and New York, which all vote Feb. 5 -- do not permit independents to vote. 
 Mr. McCain is also likely to find himself a victim of a campaign calendar that has confronted all these candidates with a wave of costly primaries and caucuses so soon after the early-voting states. In previous election cycles, Mr. McCain might have been able to ride these victories to raise money and bring back contributors who had been scared off by his earlier problems.
 There is little time for that now. And Mr. Romney is wealthy and has shown little reluctance to write a check to finance his own campaign.
 Still, the bragging rights of having won two competitive Republican contests -- and having overcome Mr. Huckabee here -- are no small thing in this muddled and inconclusive year. There are almost surely going to be fewer candidates in the Republican field by the end of the week, and Mr. McCain is going to suddenly receive the kind of news media attention that befits a genuine front-runner -- at precisely the moment he needs it.

HEADLINE: In Search of Reagan

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
 IT is now a part of the Republican catechism to regularly invoke the name of Ronald Reagan and to ritually wrap oneself in his cloak. This year's Republican candidates (and even one Democrat, Barack Obama), have all called down the spirit of St. Ronald of Dixon, Ill., to bless their candidacies.
 But they will have a hard time topping the greatest Reagan pander of all time, delivered in the summer of 1995 by Senator Bob Dole, embarking on his quest for the 1996 Republican presidential nomination, which he won, only to be crushed in the general election by the incumbent, Bill Clinton.
 ''I'm willing to be another Ronald Reagan,'' Mr. Dole told Republican Party officials in Philadelphia, ''if that's what you want.'' 
 For all his admirable qualities, Bob Dole could no more be another Ronald Reagan than he could be another Eleanor Roosevelt. The same is true of the current crop of G.O.P. contenders, for reasons of policy and polity and personality. Mr. Reagan's daughter, Patti Davis, for one, thinks they should all just come off it.
 It is more than strange, she wrote last month, to watch the 2008 presidential candidates try to imitate her father. ''Where is Lloyd Bentsen when you need him?'' she asked in a Newsweek guest column. '' 'I knew Ronald Reagan ... senator (or governor), you're no Ronald Reagan.' ''
 The first three major contests in the Republican nominating battle were won by three different candidates: Mike Huckabee took Iowa; John McCain won New Hampshire; and Mitt Romney coasted in Michigan, where he grew up. Each of them picked up a piece of the tripartite coalition that propelled Mr. Reagan to the White House in 1980: social conservatives, plus national security hawks, plus pro-business/antitax advocates. With the exception of Mr. McCain in New Hampshire, none has attracted significant numbers of working-class men and women, the so-called Reagan Democrats.
 They have all failed to assemble the entire package that made Mr. Reagan a two-term president and, earlier, a popular two-term governor of California, nor is there any sign that Fred Thompson or Rudolph W. Giuliani can.
 Those who have studied or worked on those Reagan campaigns think it unlikely that any of the current Republicans can pull it off. Even Mr. Reagan might have trouble in today's environment, they said, with the G.O.P. saddled with a worrying war, a proto-recession and an unpopular Republican incumbent.
 Despite their valiant and transparent efforts, the 2008 G.O.P. candidates have been unable to recreate the alchemy that transformed Ronald Reagan from a 1940s B-movie actor into an icon of the Republican Party. It is not just that Messrs. Huckabee, McCain, Romney, Thompson and Giuliani lack Mr. Reagan's charm. None has applied himself as long and as assiduously to marshaling ideas and developing a political base as Mr. Reagan did, honing an ideology that both fed on and nourished the growing conservative movement of his time.
 Of the main Republican contenders, none has built a national movement. Only Mr. McCain has run for president before. Two were governors of small states and one the mayor of New York. Mr. Thompson is familiar as an actor in the ''Law and Order'' television series. As relative latecomers to presidential politics, they are forced to try to assemble a coalition from the disparate groups that make up the Republican primary electorate, in many cases by fudging their records in office, altering their positions to be acceptable to G.O.P. primary voters and rewriting their personal histories.
 Mr. Reagan's ideas about the free market were formulated when he was the pitchman for General Electric in the 1950s and early '60's; his views on Communism were rooted in his experience as leader of the Screen Actors Guild starting in the 1940s; and his sense of social order grew from watching disorder spread on California campuses and in California cities in the 1960s.
 By 1980, he was a disciplined and experienced political leader and perhaps the nation's most polished public speaker, which enabled him to attract different constituencies, from evangelicals to the emerging neoconservatives.
 Mr. Reagan came to the 1980 campaign as a known quantity with a studied consistency of views dating back more than two decades. He had a record of electoral success in the nation's most populous state and valuable experience from two losing campaigns for the Republican presidential nomination. He was also blessed with an unpopular opponent in Jimmy Carter, the Iran hostage crisis, a stagnant national economy and a restless electorate.
 He was also consistently underestimated by his opponents and by many analysts, who dismissed him as a washed-up actor, an ignoramus and a tool of the rabid right.
 Morton Kondracke, writing for The New Republic at the outset of the 1980 campaign, called him ''that wrinkled old two-time loser, that joke of an ex-movie actor.'' The editor of Atlantic Monthly, Robert Manning, called him a ''casting office Goldwater.'' 
 Today's pundits, too, may be underestimating the current Republican field. Whoever emerges from this brawl will have shown a measure of Reaganesque persistence and acceptance by a geographically, culturally and politically diverse primary electorate.
 In contrast to the early careers of the current G.O.P. candidates, by the time Mr. Reagan entered his first political contest, the 1966 California gubernatorial race, he already was a nationwide celebrity and a polished communicator. (By the late 1950s, Mr. Reagan was the most-sought-after speaker in the country after President Eisenhower. Such a distinction would not apply, say. to Mike Huckabee today.) He was known to millions of Americans as an actor, host of ''Death Valley Days'' and the General Electric spokesman who gave hundreds of speeches around the country on what he called the mashed-potato circuit.
 He won the 1966 race, by upsetting the Democratic incumbent, Edmund G. (Pat) Brown with a message consciously tailored to the temper of those times, according to Matthew Dallek, author of ''The Right Moment: Ronald Reagan's First Victory and the Decisive Turning Point in American Politics'' (Free Press, 2000).
 He had become a hero to conservatives overnight with an enormously effective speech on behalf of Barry Goldwater in 1964 called ''A Time for Choosing,'' which was broadcast nationwide a week before the election. Mr. Goldwater was demolished by President Lyndon Johnson, but Mr. Reagan's political star was rising.
 ''He gave that famous speech for Goldwater and then gears up for '66 and begins to adapt his message,'' Mr. Dallek said. ''Instead of talking about Communism, which is not really a platform for a governor's office, he began talking about law and order, social decline, moral decay. His three key issues were the student protesters at Berkeley, the Watts riots and the anti-Vietnam demonstrations. So Reagan very adroitly begins to tap into a real seething anger that especially white middle- and working-class Californians feel.''
 Unlike today's candidates, Mr. Reagan, in his career, did not hark back to some imagined golden Republican era two or three decades earlier, nor did he invoke the name of some sainted G.O.P. forebear. (It's hard to imagine who that might have been.) He took a clear message, honed in hundreds of after-dinner speeches and radio commentaries, and adapted it to his time.
 Mr. Reagan also employed a kit of tools -- a quick wit, a winning smile, a soothing voice, a reassuring presence, dogged persistence -- that today's candidates might each possess in part. Mr. Huckabee has won audiences with his corn-pone humor; Mr. McCain with his biting wit; and Mr. Thompson with his Hollywood-trained voice. Mr. Reagan had them all.
 He had a set of core principles, but he had a certain suppleness on practical politics, with evolving views on abortion, federal deficits, taxes, immigration and the size of government. The guy in the Flipper suit who shows up at Romney rallies today might have found employment following Mr. Reagan back in the day.
 Mr. Reagan's first presidential foray was a now largely forgotten race against Richard Nixon in 1968 that forced Mr. Nixon to tack rightward to protect his flank. He followed with a formidable challenge to President Ford in 1976. That Republican race is remembered today by some conservatives as a high point of their movement, when their true-believing tribune from the West almost unseated a moderate Republican president tainted by years of Washington compromise.
 ''That was a donnybrook,'' said Stuart Spencer, the California political savant who ran Mr. Reagan's two gubernatorial campaigns, Mr. Ford's 1976 race and then Mr. Reagan's two White House runs in 1980 and 1984.
 ''Ford had the delegates in '76, but Reagan had the hearts and minds of the people,'' Mr. Spencer said. ''He went into 1980 with a tremendous base -- it was the beginning of the 'religious right.' He had the basic Republican constituency of economic conservatives and he picked up a bunch of disaffected Democrats.''
 The current Republican candidates, Mr. Spencer said, are looking for any way to identify with Mr. Reagan. Mr. Thompson has a new TV advertisement that features a black-and-white photo of him meeting Ronald Reagan more than 30 years ago. Mr. Romney compares his success running the 2002 Winter Olympics to Mr. Reagan's role in the downfall of Soviet Communism. Mr. McCain this month boasted of having the endorsements of 100 Reagan administration alumni. Mr. Giuliani notes that he worked for Mr. Reagan when he was a mid-level Justice Department official.
 ''Any link to Reagan, they're going to use it,'' Mr. Spencer said with a chuckle. ''If he were watching, knowing him, he'd be smiling.''

HEADLINE: Corzine May Make a Deal to Get the Toll Plan He Wants

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN and KEN BELSON

DATELINE: CAPE MAY, N.J. 

 BODY:
Gov. Jon S. Corzine, who sometimes describes himself as a washed-up bond trader, is still trading. 
 Now that he has begun his travels around the state to sell wary residents on his multibillion-dollar plan to bail New Jersey out of its fiscal mess by sharply raising highway tolls, Mr. Corzine is engaging in a familiar game of give-and-take.
 One day he suggests that he might abandon his plan to turn a portion of Route 440 between Woodbridge and Staten Island into a toll road, pleasing countless commuters and a couple of crucial allies in the State Senate. The next he warns legislators and mayors that if they reject his plan, the state will be in no fiscal condition to provide property tax relief or finance important transportation projects.
 And he is far from finished. 
 At all four town hall meetings so far -- including the one here in Cape May Court House on Saturday -- and in frequent briefings with reporters since unveiling his proposal two weeks ago, Mr. Corzine has emphasized words like ''negotiate'' and ''flexibility.''
 ''I have made expressions of flexibility,'' Mr. Corzine told reporters in Trenton on Friday. ''We will adjust the plan to meet some of these challenges that are legitimate concerns, and we'll have to work to see how much adjusting the plan actually ends up undermining its capacity to meet the dual objectives of paying down 50 percent of the state's debt and financing our state's transportation projects for a generation.''
 Not willing to give up the spotlight, or the credit, the Senate Budget Committee plans to hold a hearing Wednesday to press the administration for more details. Senator Barbara Buono, a Democrat from Middlesex County who is the committee chairwoman, has come out against the Route 440 proposal, which would affect her constituents.
 No one expected that Mr. Corzine would have an easy time convincing a skittish Legislature and a public pummeled by falling housing prices and rising gas prices and worried about a looming recession that the best remedy to ease the state's $32 billion debt and to repair its aging transportation network would be drastic toll increases on the Garden State Parkway, the New Jersey Turnpike and the Atlantic City Expressway.
 But since announcing his plan, Mr. Corzine has suggested an array of compromises, essentially guaranteeing that the final proposal will be noticeably different from the initial one.
 The crucial question is how much he is willing to bend to accommodate taxpayers and lawmakers without scaring off the traders who will be asked to sell as much as $40 billion in bonds. 
 Two legislators are already drafting bills that would provide tax credits to people hit hardest by the toll increases, which would begin in 2010 with a 50 percent increase every four years through 2022, and then be indexed for inflation until 2085.
 All of this horse trading, some say, is probably Mr. Corzine's strategy of asking for too much so that he will end up with just enough. Indeed, finance professionals assume that Mr. Corzine has crunched the numbers, and crunched them again, to come up with a spreadsheet for all seasons.
 ''He probably thinks he's only going to get one swing at this,'' said Robert L. Vitale, a partner with the law firm of Paul, Hastings, Janofsky & Walker who works on infrastructure deals. ''But everyone is going to assume he has another number because you always have to have another number.''
 Mr. Corzine has also signaled a willingness to give discounts to frequent toll road users. And during a meeting with reporters and members of the editorial board of The New York Times, he suggested that he might give discounts to people who drive hybrids or other vehicles that get more than perhaps 30 miles per gallon.
 ''Might very well do that,'' he said. 
 Timing may be another reason Mr. Corzine is willing to compromise. He says he wants the Legislature to act by March so that he can factor the figures into next year's budget, which must be approved by July 1 and is projected to have a $3 billion deficit.
 Still, Mr. Corzine's seeming flexibility on some issues is being matched by his willingness to play hardball on others. 
 He says that if his program is rejected, tolls may still rise 50 percent to finish road-widening projects that have already begun. Moreover, he warns that many programs might be scrapped, or various taxes raised, to ''Save Our State,'' as his PowerPoint presentations at the town meetings say. 
 Those tactics were termed ''political extortion'' by the Assembly minority leader, Alex DeCroce, who attended Mr. Corzine's forum in Morris County on Wednesday night. ''New Jersey taxpayers should not be pawns in a political blackmail plot,'' Mr. DeCroce said. 
 So how much is Mr. Corzine willing to come down from the 50 percent toll increases?
 State Senator Raymond J. Lesniak, a Democrat from Union County who is perhaps Mr. Corzine's staunchest ally in the Legislature, suggested that the governor simply eliminate the last 50 percent increase, planned for 2022, and replace it with a gas tax increase.
 ''I strongly believe that the fourth 50 percent increase is too burdensome, and we have to find another way to find the revenue necessary,'' Mr. Lesniak said.
 Bradley I. Abelow, Mr. Corzine's chief of staff, cautioned that the administration had its limits, too.
 ''We didn't go out at 50 so that we could be heroes at 25 percent,'' said Mr. Abelow, who accompanied Mr. Corzine to the meeting at The Times. ''While there's some flexibility and room -- there always is -- it's not as big as anyone would like, or else it just doesn't work.''
 2 Arrested Outside Meeting
 CAPE MAY COURT HOUSE, N.J. -- Steven M. Lonegan, a prominent conservative who ran unsuccessfully for the Republican nomination for governor in 2005, was one of two men arrested Saturday while protesting outside Gov. Jon S. Corzine's town hall meeting here on his toll proposal.
 Mr. Lonegan was arrested outside Middle Township High School after the police told him that he could not wave protest signs or distribute fliers there and he did so anyway, the police said. 
 A few minutes later, Seth Grossman, an ally of Mr. Lonegan from nearby Somers Point, was arrested after he sat in front of the school, put his hands behind his back and dared the police to arrest him.
 ''I also have a right to show the cameras this sign,'' Mr. Grossman said, referring to a sign saying, ''NJ Highways: Not for Sale or Lease.''
 Mr. Corzine said later that he had not been aware of the arrests. But he added, ''I think protest and speaking your mind is what democracy is all about.''
 Mr. Grossman and Mr. Lonegan, a former mayor of Bogota, 151 miles to the north, were later released. It was unclear whether either man was charged. Efforts to reach Mr. Lonegan by telephone were unsuccessful.
 Mr. Grossman, a lawyer, returned to the school and asked Mr. Corzine about the fees lawyers and consultants might collect from the toll proposal.

HEADLINE: Looking at the Slope Of Things to Come

BYLINE: By PHIL PATTON

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
''WHAT is it?'' asked a judge for the Eyes on Design Awards as he contemplated the Chrysler ecoVoyager, a long blue capsule with a stubby front end grafted onto a minivan body.
He and his fellow judges, accomplished designers that included Fabrizio Giugario of Italdesign and Willie G. Davidson of Harley-Davidson, stared and stared at the unfamiliar shape. Finally, their leader, Jack Telnack, former design chief for the Ford Motor Company, declared, ''It's a fastback van.''
 Finding new names for new vehicle silhouettes was a preoccupation during last week's press previews of the North American International Auto Show. The hot news in design here was not the latest look of grilles or the lavish use of chrome (though both trends were evident), but rooflines. Designers offered up a variety of profiles, casting aside the tried-and-true types and terms. 
 The driving force was the need to make visual sense of the concept of the crossover -- an all-purpose categorization of vehicles that combines aspects of trucks and cars. Crossovers were everywhere in all sorts of shapes inside the exhibition halls at Cobo Center. 
 But designers are also engaged in a potentially exciting rethinking of body proportions, driven by the new powertrains being developed for greener vehicles that allow components to be distributed around the car. Thanks to the technological developments spurring hybrid, electric and hydrogen-fuel-cell cars, the old three-box shape -- engine compartment, passenger cabin and trunk -- has begun to vanish. Along with it will go the nomenclature. In the end, the judges liked the ecoVoyager and gave it the Eyes on Design award for best truck concept.
 Truck? The ecoVoyager is how Chrysler imagines a future minivan powered by a fuel cell instead of a piston engine, offering a vast interior behind pairs of doors that open outward from the middle.
 Another Eyes on Design award went to the BMW X6; it was named best production truck. The awards, co-sponsored by the Detroit Institute of Ophthalmology and Dassault Systemes, the software maker, are presented for outstanding production and concept vehicle designs. 
 Neither the Chrysler nor BMW designers considered their creations to be trucks. To some at the show, the X6 crossover seemed more like a 5 Series sedan with an odd roof; to others it looked like an X5 sport utility modified with a chopped fastback roof. 
 ''We won an award for a truck?'' was the reaction of Chris Bangle, chief of design for the BMW Group. Anders Warming, BMW's director of exterior design, was more enthusiastic about the award, but he also put the vehicle in a different category. He stood beside the X6 and said: ''It's a coupe. And coupe comes from the French word for cut.''
 In the American idiom, coupe has come to mean a two-door automobile. But the European meaning of coupe -- pronounce that coo-PAY, please -- goes back to horse-and-carriage days. 
 Of late, the profile of a low coupe-style roof for a four-door vehicle has obsessed European auto designers. Without apologies to the rear passengers who have to bow their heads to get in or out of the car, stylists have fallen in love with these sleek four-door silhouettes in the same way the designers once adored sharply slanted fastbacks.
 A strong influence has been the Mercedes-Benz CLS four-door coupe. The Porsche Panamera, which was not displayed at the Detroit show, offers related lines. So does the Volkswagen Passat CC, a future production model introduced here that seemed like an uninspired imitation of the Mercedes CLS.
 A very different understanding of the coupe profile was visible in the Cadillac CTS Coupe Concept, also an award winner. 
 ''I am just taken with that silhouette,'' Laurens van den Acker, manager of Mazda's design division, said admiringly. 
 The CTS coupe was named best car concept. The sharp-edge design channeled the spirit of two-door Caddies of the past, like the classic chiseled 1967 Eldorado, to offer competition for European luxury coupes. But the car's roofline linked a front end that seemed much busier and more highly detailed than the rear, with its large and powerfully sculptured planes. 
 A silhouette can sell. It was surprising that the only small car of note introduced at the show was the Ford Verve, whose size falls into what the auto industry calls the B-class. Small cars offer automakers a way to meet higher fuel economy standards.
 The Verve goes on sale in the United States in 2010, although not necessarily by that name. In Detroit, Ford showed the Verve as both a sporty two-door hatchback and as a four-door sedan with a sleek, flowing roofline. 
 The Verve is aimed at fighting American stereotypes about econoboxes and hatchbacks. J Mays, the Ford design chief, says his staff is convinced that better styling will make small cars more appealing to younger buyers. ''A sports car with a hatchback is not a hatchback,'' said Freeman Thomas, a Ford designer. ''It's still a sports car.''
 The Verve's grille and profile are in the shape of a trapezoid. If any geometric shape can be declared the star of the show, this is it.
 ''Why a trapezoid?'' Mr. Mays asked. ''Because it is a powerful, planted-looking shape.'' He sprang from his chair and stood, feet apart, like a sentry. ''When I stand like this, I look ready for action.''
 The trapezoid is also the basis of the shape of a small hybrid pickup truck, the A-BAT, that made its debut here. The A-BAT was designed by Ian Cartabiano and Matt Sperling of Toyota's Calty studio in California. 
 The Cadillac Provoq, ostensibly powered by a fuel cell, and the Saturn Flextreme, a plug-in electric, are concepts with radically futuristic profiles. Their sweeping rooflines were made possible by the elimination of internal combustion engines.
 The profiles on display in Detroit also suggested the continuing attraction of the crossover as the successor to the S.U.V. But the designs of many crossovers have ended up as gawky compromises. 
 ''Everyone has been trying to get the C.U.V. right,'' Mr. Mays said, using the industry's abbreviation for crossover utility vehicle. ''Mazda did it with CX-7 and CX-9. We missed badly with Freestyle, and I think got it right with Edge and very right with Flex.'' 
 The bulky Freestyle has been spiffed up and renamed Taurus X. The Ford Flex, arriving this summer as a 2009 model, has a long, flat roof -- the profile of a modernist house, perhaps.
 A very different roofline is offered on a Lincoln design study built on the same foundation as the Flex. The Lincoln MKT, which made its debut here, has a bustle-back rear end and raised rear fenders. Its profile could not contrast more with the Flex's flat roof. 
 In downtown Detroit, the latest rooflines on the horizon are new casinos. So it seems fitting that the signature curved roof of the MotorCity Casino Hotel was designed in consultation with Chip Foose, the independent auto designer.
 The shape of the Detroit skyline, as well as the shape of the cars on exhibit here, is changing.

HEADLINE: At Some Superfund Sites, Toxic Legacies Linger

BYLINE: By DAVID HOLMBERG

DATELINE: SAYREVILLE, N.J. 

 BODY:
THERE was nothing unspoiled about the woods that Robert Spiegel trudged through recently on a single-minded quest for wrongs against nature.
The woods off Horseshoe Road here in Middlesex County are still tainted by human intrusions from decades ago. They are the target of a Superfund project -- a lengthy federal cleanup of a former chemical-processing plant that Mr. Spiegel, executive director of the Edison Wetlands Association, said was inadequately financed and too prolonged. 
 Like many Superfund sites in New Jersey and elsewhere in the New York City area, it has an intriguing history that is hard to trace -- mobsters reportedly owned one business here before abandoning it abruptly years ago. In 1981 a brush fire exposed 70 drums containing silver cyanide and other dangerous chemicals.
 This 12-acre site is among the 114 hazardous waste sites in New Jersey on the Environmental Protection Agency's National Priorities List, which includes about 1,200 sites nationwide that the agency has determined present a ''significant risk to human health or the environment.'' 
 On Long Island, 26 hazardous waste sites are on the National Priorities List; 15 in Nassau County and 11 in Suffolk, including the former Roosevelt Field in Garden City, where Charles Lindbergh took off for his historic trans-Atlantic flight in 1927. In Connecticut, 14 sites are on the list, including 3 each in New Haven and Windham Counties and 2 each in Fairfield and Hartford Counties. 
 The federal Superfund program to clean up the most dangerous hazardous waste sites began in 1980 after 22,000 tons of toxic waste were discovered dumped in the Love Canal neighborhood of Niagara Falls, N.Y. Billions of dollars have been spent since then completing the cleanup of more than 1,000 sites nationwide, but money for the program has been harder to come by since a Superfund tax levied against industries generating pollution, which helped pay for cleanups, expired in 1995.
 ''Government and private industry have been historically indifferent to environmental consequences, and this generation is paying for it,'' said Richard Amper, the executive director of the Long Island Pine Barrens Society, an environmental group. ''And this generation needs to clean it up.''
 But the Environmental Protection Agency's task is not easy, even though it has hard-working, well-trained staff members, said Ella Filippone, a longtime environmentalist who is executive director of the Passaic River Coalition in New Jersey. Business owners and politicians sometimes raise objections to cleanups that the agency is obligated to examine even though that is time-consuming, she said.
 ''It's the politics that interferes sometimes,'' she said, adding that there needs to be a point where officials conclude about a given site, ''Let's clean it up.''
 Alan J. Steinberg, the E.P.A. administrator for Superfund's Region 2, which includes New Jersey, New York, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, defended the Superfund, calling it ''one of the most effective programs in federal government,'' and said politics did not play a role in E.P.A. decisions. 
 ''Our motto is 'the polluter pays,' '' he said, adding that 75 percent of polluters currently singled out by the agency have paid for cleanups and that $1 billion in fees were recovered from polluters last year.
 The E.P.A. does not estimate the number of hazardous waste sites over all in the country or, generally, in individual states, because there is federal and state and multiagency involvement, and Superfund projects are at too many different stages for quantification, a spokeswoman said. 
 In Middlesex County, on the 12-acre Horseshoe Road site, there are buried toxins that leak into the nearby Raritan River, a home to commercial crabbing; patches of underbrush with possibly contaminated debris; and toxic sludge.
 Mr. Spiegel made two discoveries on his exploratory trek, accompanied by the wetlands association's director of operations, David Wheeler, and a reporter and photographer. He stumbled upon a strikingly purple puddle of water marked by a faint deer track, and a tiny green frog that struggled for life on an old railway tie. Mr. Spiegel picked the frog up and examined it, then dropped it in a nearby pond. 
 Both the colorful puddle and the floundering frog may have been contaminated by chemicals, whose odor was detectable at the edge of the Raritan, a river once ranked as the 16th-most polluted in the nation. In 1989 the Environmental Protection Agency conducted its first soil analysis on the site, which has four separate areas, including a drum dump and a pesticide dump. E.P.A. investigators found volatile organic compounds, or VOCs; heavy metals; pesticides; and polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs.
 Some of the substances found at Superfund sites are considered carcinogenic, and children are especially susceptible to many of the pollutants, say experts like Dr. Philip J. Landrigan, chairman of community and preventive medicine and a pediatrics professor at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City. 
 Superfund sites are designated by the E.P.A. under a hazard-ranking system and thus become eligible for cleanups. When and how those cleanups are made and who pays for them are sources of contention among the E.P.A., environmental groups and owners or former owners of the contaminated sites.
 After the Superfund tax against businesses generating pollution expired in 1995, the $3.8 billion then in the fund for cleanups was gone by 2003; money for cleanups also came from companies determined to have polluted the sites. The E.P.A. has scrambled for Congressional financing for Superfund cleanups ever since. Since the cleanup fund ran out, the Center for Public Integrity, a nonprofit research organization based in Washington, said in a report, Superfund has relied on an annual appropriation of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion in tax dollars and the increasing amount of money the E.P.A. recovered from companies it had linked to polluted sites.
 At the old Roosevelt Field on Long Island, the E.P.A. says groundwater was polluted and two Garden City supply wells were tainted by chemicals used at the airfield's maintenance shop. The agency recently estimated that cleanup of the groundwater would cost $13.2 million and take at least 10 years.
 In Connecticut, the National Priorities List sites include the 30-acre former Scovill industrial landfill in Waterbury. The site was used by the Scovill Manufacturing Company for the disposal of ash, cinder and other wastes from 1919 to the mid-1970s. According to the E.P.A., soil samples showed elevated levels of a variety of toxic substances -- organic chemicals; PCBs; and metals like cadmium, nickel, silver and zinc.
 At the Horseshoe Road site in New Jersey, a sign posted by the E.P.A. on a locked gate said: ''Warning: hazardous material present in soil and marsh area. Avoid contact.'' 
 Mr. Spiegel and his organization conceded that the E.P.A. had carried out its cleanup mission successfully at some Superfund sites. One that he termed ''a model for a total cleanup'' was on his itinerary earlier that morning -- the former Chemical Insecticide Corporation plant in Edison Township.
 The company operated a plant on the site for 16 years beginning in 1954, processing pesticides. The E.P.A.'s enormous cleanup included the excavation of 207,000 cubic yards of contaminated soil, at a cost of $66 million, and 13,500 cubic yards of contaminated sediments, at a cost of $2.2 million.
 But not all cleanups progress the same way. Mr. Amper of the Long Island Pine Barrens Society said that different cleanups require different approaches, a viewpoint he said environmentalists took a while to accept. ''A cleanup approach to a site that will be recycled for, say, a factory is different than if you're anticipating a day care center,'' he said.
 Still, environmentalists are concerned about the efforts at some cleanups. Mr. Spiegel said that there were insufficient signs in the woods around the Horseshoe Road site and that the gates, even when locked, could be easily circumvented, especially by children or hunters.
 William J. McCabe, who retired earlier this month as the deputy director of the emergency and regional response division of Superfund's Region 2, acknowledged in a telephone interview that maintaining adequate security at the Horseshoe Road site and others was a recurring problem. 
 ''We keep doing stuff,'' he said -- like repairing broken fences -- ''but if people really want to get on a site, they probably will find a way.'' He said it came down to ''how much can we do'' to prevent trespassing?
 Mr. Spiegel contended that the E.P.A. sometimes misled the public about safety and other factors at Superfund sites, which the agency denies, saying that communities in close proximity to sites are kept fully informed. Mr. Spiegel specifically chided the agency for the lengthy time frame it listed in a recent report on cleaning up another nearby site he visited that morning -- the former location of a Cornell Dubilier Electronics plant in South Plainfield. The E.P.A., which began work on the site in 1997, said the cleanup would not be completed until 2034.
 Cornell Dubilier, a manufacturer of electronic parts and components, operated the plant from 1936 to 1962. Part of the site is now an industrial park; Cornell's buildings were torn down. An E.P.A. report said the company dumped PCB-contaminated material and other hazardous substances into the soil; Mr. Spiegel said the site has the highest concentration of PCBs in the state.
 Mr. McCabe said that contaminated groundwater at the Cornell Dubilier site was so extensive and difficult to deal with that a total cleanup could take ''any number of years.'' He said the agency's invoking of the year 2034 ''could be taken both ways'' by the public -- that the agency was being honest, ''or we're never going to be out of there.'' 
 But he said that ''anybody who knows that site knows the reality; I'll opt for the openness.''
 Superfund reality, as defined politically or economically, is often long-range. In Congress now, according to Senate staff members, there is some inclination to try to revive the kind of tax against industries that financed the Superfund for 15 years. Legislation may be introduced this year, but whether it would pass with the narrow Democratic majority and the Bush administration in power is uncertain, the staff members said. 
 Former Gov. James Florio of New Jersey, a Democrat who as a congressman played a role in starting the Superfund more than a quarter century ago, noted that its ''key principle was that polluters pay.'' He said that he thought that the tax would get through after this year if the Democrats win in November. 
 At the moment, the tax issue, last pursued by Congress in 2003, although without success, seems to be back on the table. Katherine N. Probst, a principal author of a report to Congress, ''Superfund's Future: What Will It Cost?,'' said her report received only limited attention after she completed it in 2001. But recently she has received an increasing number of inquiries from Congressional staff members about the possibility of reviving the tax. 
 ''They're using the book more now,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Republicans in South Carolina Focus on the Economy and Values

BYLINE: By MARJORIE CONNELLY and DALIA SUSSMAN

 BODY:
Voters in the South Carolina Republican primary on Saturday said they were more concerned about the nation's economy than they were about illegal immigration, the war in Iraq or terrorism, according to a poll conducted as people left polling places across the state. 
 Voters also said it was more important that the eventual nominee share their values than whether he had the right experience, was forthright or was likely to beat the Democratic nominee in the fall. 
Two-thirds of the voters said their own family's finances were holding steady, while about one in 10 said they were falling behind.
 These are among the early findings of an exit poll conducted by Edison Media Research and Mitofsky International. The poll found Senator John McCain and Mike Huckabee in a tight race.
 The primary voters were mostly conservative, with nearly seven in 10 voters saying they were likely to describe themselves that way. More than six in 10 said they attended religious services on a weekly basis, and more than half were white evangelical Christians. More than two-thirds said it mattered to them at least somewhat that a candidate shared their religious beliefs.
 More than half of the primary voters said a candidate's position on the issues was more important than his personal qualities.
 While open to all voters, the primary was dominated by Republicans and conservatives. Eight in 10 voters described themselves as Republicans (up from six in 10 in the 2000 primary), and one in three said they were ''very'' conservative.
 About 45 percent of Mr. Huckabee's supporters described themselves as very conservative, while about the same number of Mr. McCain's supporters said they were moderate or liberal.
 Most of Mr. Huckabee's supporters described themselves as evangelical or born-again Christians, and most said they attended religious services at least once a week. Six in 10 Huckabee supporters said it mattered a great deal that a presidential candidate shared their religious beliefs.
 On the matter of electability, more voters said Mr. McCain had the best chance of winning the general election in November than any of the other candidates. But voters were divided between Mr. McCain and Mr. Huckabee over who was more likely to bring change to the country.
 About seven in 10 voters said abortion should be illegal in all or most cases, and just over half said that illegal immigrants working in the United States should be deported. 
 Nine in 10 of those who voted for Mr. Huckabee held the position that abortion should be illegal. And about 60 percent of them said illegal immigrants should be deported.
 Mr. McCain's supporters were more likely to favor abortion rights and oppose deportation. About 40 percent of Mr. McCain's voters wanted abortion to remain legal, and almost as many said illegal immigrants should be offered a chance to apply for citizenship.
 Voters, however, split over whether cutting taxes or reducing the budget deficit should be a higher priority. Almost six in 10 of those who voted for Mr. McCain said reducing the federal deficit should be a higher priority for the next president, while half of Mr. Huckabee's voters favored cutting taxes.
 The exit poll was conducted for the National Election Pool, which consists of television networks, cable news channels and The Associated Press. The results are based on 1,648 voters in 35 randomly selected precincts. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus four percentage points.

HEADLINE: Clean Energy as Stimulus

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Responding to Recession,'' by Paul Krugman (column, Jan. 14): 
 Candidates looking for an integrated economic stimulus package: look no further! Clean energy and green technologies are the wave of the future. Prime alternative energy industries promote ''smart,'' digitally driven electric-grid technologies; give tax breaks to consumers and producers of innovative technologies; use progressive procurement policies on all government levels (for example, for all hybrid vehicle fleets). 
 Start a Healthy Cities Program for green buildings, rooftop gardens, walking paths, biking lanes, open space, traffic control and improved public transport -- all measures that reduce air pollution, curb the ''urban heat island effect'' and stimulate industries with low carbon technologies. 
 With so much market liquidity (paper wealth) shriveling, shifting public and private investments into real wealth makes financial and fiscal sense. A large investment in our common future would create a new clean/green machine for the global economy, and help stabilize the climate.

HEADLINE: Losses Spur Fears About City Economy

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
By most official measures, the New York metropolitan area appears to be shrugging off the economic troubles that have beset much of the country. With fears of an imminent recession spreading from California to Michigan to Washington, the latest data still show New York recording job gains and rising tax revenue.
 On Thursday, the federal Department of Labor released a report with the headline: ''Job count for the New York area rises by 80,000 over the year.'' And while Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg was recounting his administration's fiscal accomplishments, the state's Labor Department reported that New York City continued to add jobs in December in fields as diverse as finance, education, health care and tourism. 
 But few were reassured by those numbers as some of the city's biggest private-sector employers posted their largest quarterly losses ever last week. Now, economists and city and state officials are acknowledging that 2008 could turn out to be far worse than their already dampened expectations.
 ''People may be overly optimistic about how resilient this city will continue to be in the face of a financial downturn,'' said Jason Bram, an economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. ''The real question is how bad it will be.''
 Announcements last week from Citigroup and Merrill Lynch that each had lost nearly $10 billion in the last three months of 2007, their biggest quarterly losses, signaled that the fallout from the cratering of the market for risky mortgages could be worse than anticipated. 
 Merrill, the nation's biggest brokerage firm, said it had already eliminated about 1,000 jobs, and Citigroup said it planned to cut about 4,000. Bank of America announced that it would cut an additional 650 jobs in its investment bank, which eliminated 500 jobs a few months ago. 
 Analysts said they expected more job cuts on Wall Street as the big banks continued to contract in the wake of the mortgage crisis. But early projections of how many jobs will be lost and the effect of those losses on the region's economy are being overtaken with each new piece of bad financial news. 
 ''In a sense, we're on a rolling revision here,'' said Frank Braconi, the chief economist in the city comptroller's office. ''It's kind of clear that people are internalizing the information that's coming out and getting more pessimistic pretty much by the week.''
 In a report released this month, the Independent Budget Office attempted to estimate the effect that the poor performance on Wall Street would have on city coffers. Assuming the collective profit of those firms was zero last quarter, the Independent Budget Office projected a drop of more than $1.4 billion in tax collections on business and personal income in the 2008 fiscal year, which ends June 30.
 The report also laid out a gloomier situation: If Wall Street firms lost $4.6 billion in the last quarter, it projected that the city would lose a total of 8,700 jobs this year and an additional $500 million in tax revenue over two years.
 But even that worse-case view might have been too rosy. The combined $20 billion in losses at Citigroup and Merrill has already exceeded the direst of official forecasts. 
 In releasing a report last week on declining Wall Street bonuses at the end of 2007, Thomas P. DiNapoli, the state comptroller, noted that collections of personal income taxes in the city and state had remained strong so far. ''But the future is not so bright,'' Mr. DiNapoli said. ''The losses sustained in the securities industry during the second half of 2007 are a fairly clear indicator that tax collections, especially from business taxes, will erode in 2008.''
 In an interview, Mr. DiNapoli, while declining to guess how far those tax collections might fall, said that the current projection of a $4.3 billion gap in the state's budget was ''a very conservative estimate of what it's going to be.''
 Mr. DiNapoli's office estimated that, despite their troubles, Wall Street firms paid out $33.2 billion in bonuses last year, down only slightly from $33.9 billion in 2006. Those payments should help buoy the economies of the city and its suburbs at a time when tighter credit is likely to crimp spending.
 Mr. Bram said the city's economy ''is better off in a situation where Wall Street is cutting bonuses than cutting jobs.'' Widespread layoffs could deter people from coming to New York to seek work, he said.
 ''It's reassuring that so far there haven't been many layoffs,'' Mr. Bram said. ''But not too reassuring.''
 He said that for now, New York appeared to be sidestepping the downturn that had taken hold in some regions, in part because there was a lag between national economic measurements and local ones. 
 And New York's economy differs from those of many other major metropolitan areas because of its greater dependence on finance and professional services, tourism and business travel, he said. But it is not immune to weakness in the national economy.
 Steven Cochrane, a senior managing director at Moody's Economy.com, said some big states, including California, Michigan and Florida, already were in recession. But New York and other Northeastern states appear to be still growing ''at a very moderate pace,'' he said.
 With the continuing losses on Wall Street, Mr. Cochrane said, he considered the probability of New York's entering a recession this year to be ''above 50 percent.'' If that does happen, he said, a national recession will be unavoidable. 
 ''So, in a sense, New York is the key to whether the U.S. skirts recession,'' Mr. Cochrane said.
 Wall Street has rebounded quickly from some past slumps, like the one that followed the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s. But the protracted turmoil the financial firms are in now is causing concern that the damage to the city's economy might last beyond a national recession, Mr. Cochrane said.
 If there is a recession in 2008, he added, ''New York might be last in, last out.''

HEADLINE: Until All the Fish Are Gone

 BODY:
Scientists have been warning for years that overfishing is degrading the health of the oceans and destroying the fish species on which much of humanity depends for jobs and food. Even so, it would be hard to frame the problem more dramatically than two recent articles in The Times detailing the disastrous environmental, economic and human consequences of often illegal industrial fishing. 
 Sharon LaFraniere showed how mechanized fishing fleets from the European Union and nations like China and Russia -- usually with the complicity of local governments -- have nearly picked clean the oceans off Senegal and other northwest African countries. This has ruined coastal economies and added to the surge of suddenly unemployed migrants who brave the high seas in wooden boats seeking a new life in Europe, where they are often not welcome. 
 The second article, by Elisabeth Rosenthal, focused on Europe's insatiable appetite for fish -- it is now the world's largest consumer. Having overfished its own waters of popular species like tuna, swordfish and cod, Europe now imports 60 percent of what it consumes. Of that, up to half is contraband, fish caught and shipped in violation of government quotas and treaties.
 The industry, meanwhile, is organized to evade serious regulation. Big factory ships from places like Europe, China, Korea and Japan stay at sea for years at a time -- fueling, changing crews, unloading their catch on refrigerated vessels. The catch then enters European markets through the Canary Islands and other ports where inspection is minimal. After that, retailers and consumers neither ask nor care where the fish came from, or whether, years from now, there will be any fish at all.
 From time to time, international bodies try to do something to slow overfishing. The United Nations banned huge drift nets in the 1990s, and recently asked its members to halt bottom trawling, a particularly ruthless form of industrial fishing, on the high seas. Last fall, the European Union banned fishing for bluefin tuna in the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean, where bluefin have been decimated.
 The institution with the most potential leverage is the World Trade Organization. Most of the world's fishing fleets receive heavy government subsidies for boat building, equipment and fuel, America's fleet less so than others. Without these subsidies, which amount to about $35 billion annually, fleets would shrink in size and many destructive practices like bottom trawling would become uneconomic. 
 The W.T.O. has never had a reputation for environmental zeal. But knowing that healthy fisheries are important to world trade and development, the group has begun negotiating new trade rules aimed at reducing subsidies. It produced a promising draft in late November, but there is no fixed schedule for a final agreement. 
 The world needs such an agreement, and soon. Many fish species may soon be so depleted that they will no longer be able to reproduce themselves. As 125 of the world's most respected scientists warned in a letter to the W.T.O. last year, the world is at a crossroads. One road leads to tremendously diminished marine life. The other leads to oceans again teeming with abundance. The W.T.O. can help choose the right one.

HEADLINE: Slovenia Chief Is Accused of Censorship

BYLINE: By DAN BILEFSKY

DATELINE: LJUBLJANA, Slovenia 

 BODY:
As a young journalist in the late 1980s, Janez Jansa, now prime minister, played a critical role in spurring Slovenia's pro-democracy movement after he was sentenced to 18 months in prison for opposing the Communist government and writing articles attacking the former Yugoslav Army.
 In an extraordinary inversion of the past, his opponents now accuse him of trying to censor the news media whose freedom he fought to uphold. A recent report by Freedom House, a pro-democracy watchdog group based in New York, said that the Slovene news media ''faced indirect political and economic pressure from the government and business interests'' and that government officials sometimes treated journalists as if they were ''the political opposition.'' 
 Such is the concern about press freedom in this formerly Communist country that 571 journalists recently signed a petition delivered to Parliament and to European leaders that accused Mr. Jansa of censorship. The petition -- supported by the European Federation of Journalists -- questioned whether Slovenia, which took over the presidency of the European Union on Jan. 1, was sufficiently democratic to represent the bloc of nearly 500 million people.
 The public attack is still reverberating in this Balkan nation of two million people.
 ''It is embarrassing for Slovenia and for the E.U. that it is now presided over by a country that does not uphold European values of press freedom,'' said Blaz Zgaga, one of two journalists who led the petition drive.
 Media analysts say that concerns about press freedom in Slovenia reflect a trend across Eastern and Central Europe, where former Communist countries are struggling to shed the authoritarian political cultures of the past. In Slovenia, which was part of the former Yugoslavia ruled by Tito for 35 years, the Communist Party exerted control over the news media and censored opponents.
 Mr. Jansa, asked last week whether he was stifling the media, was emphatic. If the main measure of press freedom ''is the possibility to criticize the government, then we have 200 percent freedom,'' he said.
 The government cited several independent studies, including a 2007 report by Reporters Without Borders that ranked Slovenia above France, Spain, Italy, Australia and the United States in press freedom.
 Yet journalists, media executives and analysts in Slovenia say that its center-right government has used state-owned funds or companies with controlling stakes in leading newspapers to weed out editors and journalists critical of the government.
 The former secretary of state for the economy, Andrijana Starina Kosem, said during an interview that in August 2005, she and the prime minister orchestrated a deal to gain editorial influence over Delo, the country's most influential newspaper. Delo, of which Lasko, a beer company, owns a majority of shares, was founded in 1959 and is the second largest daily newspaper in Slovenia, after the tabloid Slovenske Novice. Delo's influence on Slovene public life is comparable to that of The Times of London or Le Monde in their countries. 
 Starina Kosem, who now runs the supervisory board of Delo and was once a golf partner of the prime minister's, said Lasko was determined to buy part of Mercator, a large retailer partly owned by the state. In a private meeting in Mr. Jansa's office, she said, the government agreed to sell part of its stake in Mercator to Lasko in return for the brewer's promise to install editors and management sympathetic to the government.
 ''Jansa was determined to gain control of the media, and he did a deal to make sure that would happen,'' said Ms. Kosem, who resigned from her post as state secretary in May 2007 before disclosing her allegations of state censorship in a letter leaked to the press.
 Anze Logar, a government spokesman, denied that the government had tried to gain control of Delo. The share sale, he said, had been motivated to reduce government ownership of private industry.
 Ms. Kosem said she had helped arrange the agreement because she was convinced that as a former dissident, Mr. Jansa, now 49, would still use his influence to expand media freedom.
 Instead, she said, he would send a flurry of cellphone text messages each morning berating editors of papers with headlines critical of the government, an allegation his office denied.
 Shortly after the purported deal, she said, Delo's new management installed a new editor, Peter Jancic, whose mandate was to bring the paper into line with government thinking. Nearly a dozen Delo journalists resigned in protest.
 Delo journalists say critical reporting of government policies has become increasingly difficult. As evidence, they point to Mr. Jancic's decision to recall the Delo correspondent in Vienna to Ljubljana in April after he published stories critical of government policy toward the Slovene minority in Austria. The correspondent in Zagreb, Croatia, who had criticized the government for a police buildup at Slovenia's disputed border with Croatia, was also recalled.
 Mr. Jancic, who has since been replaced as editor, said during an interview that the correspondents had been recalled because they were injecting their opinions into stories. He said that as editor, he never came under direct government pressure.
 ''My editorial policy was to be fair, accurate and unbiased,'' he said.
 Writing in a recent issue of Delo, Drago Jancar, a leading Slovene rightist intellectual, said that Mr. Jansa was a victim of unprecedented ''media lynching'' and that ''sensationalism making mountains out of molehills is in full swing.''
 He lamented that when a state minister's wife used an official car to go to the store to buy a broom, it was front-page news.

HEADLINE: Serbs Vote For President; Close Runoff Is Expected

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Serbia 

 BODY:
A pro-Western candidate and a nationalist faced off Sunday in a closely contested Serbian presidential race that could determine whether the troubled Balkan nation will move closer to the European Union or sink back into isolation. 
 President Boris Tadic received about 35 percent of the first-round vote, compared with 39 percent for his top challenger, Tomislav Nikolic, according to the Center for Free Elections and Democracy, which independently counted votes alongside election officials. ''We can conclude that there will be a runoff,'' said Zoran Lucic, an official of the independent monitoring group. ''The runoff will be extremely tight.''
 The state electoral commission said about 54 percent of voters had cast ballots two hours before the polls closed, the largest turnout since 2000, when Mr. Milosevic lost power, and more than in 2004, when Mr. Nikolic edged ahead of Mr. Tadic in the first round, but lost in a runoff. 
 The expected declaration of independence next month by the Serbian province of Kosovo cast a shadow over the vote, which attracted a record turnout. Serbs regard Kosovo as their medieval heartland, and the election's main contenders are vehemently opposed to its independence. 
 But Kosovo's independence aspirations are backed by a majority of European Union countries and the United States. Kosovo, which is 90 percent ethnic Albanian, has been under United Nations protection since 1999, after NATO intervened to halt the brutal suppression of Kosovo's Albanians by Slobodan Milosevic, the Yugoslavia's president. 
 The European Union has been pressing Kosovo to hold off declaring its independence until after the second round of the Serbian elections, on Feb. 3, out of concern that a premature declaration would play into the hands of Serbian nationalists. 
 Some 6.7 million people were eligible to vote, including more than 100,000 in Kosovo, where the balloting was organized only in municipalities held by ethnic Serbs. Ethnic Albanians have boycotted all Serbian elections since the early 1990s. 
 Nine candidates were vying for the presidency, but only two were considered serious contenders: the pro-Western incumbent, Mr. Tadic, and his pro-Russian nationalist challenger, Mr. Nikolic. The presidency is formally a ceremonial post in Serbia. But during Mr. Milosevic's autocratic government in the 1990s, when he virtually ruled alone, it gained in importance and influence. 
 Mr. Tadic, a telegenic and soft-spoken moderate who is supported by a majority of European leaders, advocates Western-style reforms and integration into the European Union, after more than a decade of isolation and wars under Mr. Milosevic. 
 ''This election decides which path Serbia is going to take and what is the future for Serbia and our children,'' Mr. Tadic said after casting his ballot, predicting that there would be a runoff. ''I'm very optimistic about the final outcome of this vote.''
 Mr. Nikolic, a former ally of Mr. Milosevic, has sought to evoke Serbs' nationalist pride by playing on their growing frustration over American and European Union backing for Kosovo independence. Analysts say a victory by Mr. Nikolic would probably bury Serbia's pro-European aspirations, push the country back into political isolation and undermine its economic prospects. 
 The support for Mr. Nikolic reflects the mounting nationalism in Serbia over Kosovo, but also the dissatisfaction of Serbs with the pace of pro-Western reforms begun after the fall of Mr. Milosevic in 2000.

HEADLINE: New York Measuring Teachers By Student Progress on Tests

BYLINE: By JENNIFER MEDINA

 BODY:
New York City has embarked on an ambitious experiment, yet to be announced, in which some 2,500 teachers are being measured on how much their students improve on annual standardized tests. 
 The move is so contentious that principals in some of the 140 schools participating have not told their teachers that they are being scrutinized based on student performance and improvement. 
 While officials say it is too early to determine how they will use the data, which is already being collected, they say it could eventually be used to help make decisions on teacher tenure or as a significant element in performance evaluations and bonuses. And they hold out the possibility that the ratings for individual teachers could be made public. 
 ''If the only thing we do is make this data available to every person in the city -- every teacher, every parent, every principal, and say do with it what you will -- that will have been a powerful step forward,'' said Chris Cerf, the deputy schools chancellor who is overseeing the project. ''If you know as a parent what's the deal, I think that whole aspect will change behavior.'' 
 The effort comes as educators nationwide are struggling to figure out how to find, train and measure good teachers. Many education experts say that until teacher quality improves in urban schools, student performance is likely to stagnate and the achievement gap between white and minority students will never be closed. Other school systems, including those in Dallas and Houston as well as in the whole state of Tennessee, are also using student performance and improvement as factors in evaluating teachers.
 The United Federation of Teachers, the city's teachers' union, has known about the experiment for months, but has not been told which schools are involved, because the Education Department has promised those principals confidentiality.
 Randi Weingarten, the union president, said she had grave reservations about the project, and would fight if the city tried to use the information for tenure or formal evaluations or even publicized it. She and the city disagree over whether such moves would be allowed under the contract. 
 ''There is no way that any of this current data could actually, fairly, honestly or with any integrity be used to isolate the contributions of an individual teacher,'' Ms. Weingarten said. ''If one permitted this, it would be one of the worst decisions of my professional life.''
 New York invited principals from hundreds of elementary and middle schools with sufficient annual testing data to participate in the program, which will produce an elaborate stream of data on 2,500 teachers. 
 In 140 schools -- a tenth of the roughly 1,400 in the system -- teachers are being measured on how many students in their classes meet basic progress goals, how much student performance grows each year, and how that improvement compares with the performance of similar students with other teachers. 
 In another 140 schools, principals are being asked to make subjective evaluations of roughly the same number of teachers so officials can see if the two systems produce widely disparate results. New York City schools employ roughly 77,000 teachers. In all 280 schools, the principals agreed to participate in the program. 
 Deputy Chancellor Cerf said that how students performed on tests would not be the only factor considered in any system to rate teachers. All decisions will include personal circumstances and experiences, he said, but the point will be to put a focus on whether or not students are improving. 
 ''This isn't about how hard we try,'' Mr. Cerf said. ''This is about however you got here, are your students learning?'' 
 Ms. Weingarten said the system was not needed. ''Any real educator can know within five minutes of walking into a classroom if a teacher is effective,'' she said. ''These tests were never intended and have never been validated for the use of evaluating teachers.''
 The experiment is in line with the city's increasing use of standardized test scores to measure whether students are improving, and to judge school quality. A new bonus program for teachers and principals, as well as the letter grading system for schools unveiled last fall, are all linked to improvement in scores. Nationally, too, school systems are increasingly relying on these measures to judge schools.
 Virtually all education experts agree that finding high-quality teachers is critical to improving student learning, particularly in high-poverty urban areas, where good teachers are usually more difficult to find. Recent research has found that the best teachers can help struggling students catch up to more advanced students within three years.
 But experts are grappling with how to determine what makes a good teacher. Neither graduate programs in education schools nor previous academic records are reliable predictors, they say. The federal No Child Left Behind law requires that districts place a ''highly qualified'' teacher in every classroom, which typically means one who has completed a certification program, but this, too, is not necessarily a good indicator of quality.
 ''It seems hard to know who is going to be effective in the classroom until they are actually in the classroom,'' said Thomas J. Kane, a professor of education and economics at Harvard, who is conducting several research projects on teacher quality in New York City, and who is involved in the new effort. 
 Mr. Kane said there was little evidence that teachers with the ''right paper qualifications'' were any more effective than those without them. ''But most school districts spend very little time trying to assess how good teachers are in their first couple of years, when it is most important,'' he said. 
 Nationwide, more than 95 percent of teachers receive tenure within their first three years of teaching, according to some studies. And once teachers receive tenure, it is extremely difficult to have them removed from classrooms. 
 In some sense, New York's effort to judge teachers partly on their students' improvement is a logical extension of the grading system for schools that was unveiled last fall, although officials adamantly say they have no plans to assign letter grades to individual teachers. 
 ''I don't think anyone here would embrace the formulaic use of even the most sophisticated instrument -- you get tenure if this, you don't get tenure if that,'' Mr. Cerf said. 
 He added that the new effort was just one of several ways in which the city was exploring how to evaluate and improve teacher quality. In recent months, city officials have begun training new lawyers to help principals navigate the considerable red tape required to remove inadequate teachers. 
 They have increased recruiting efforts to attract talented teachers to hard-to-staff schools. And they are allowing schools to earn merit bonus pools to distribute to teachers based on test scores.
 ''This should simply be one more way to think about things,'' said Frank A. Cimino, the principal of P.S. 193 in Brooklyn, who said he was participating in the experiment. ''It is going to tell you some things you don't know, but it will miss the other things that go on in a classroom.'' 
 William Sanders, a researcher in North Carolina who was one of the first to begin evaluating teachers and schools based on student test score improvements, said that while such a system could be used to make broad judgments, it was difficult to use it with precision enough to find differences among teachers who are simply average.
 ''Can you distinguish the top teachers? Yes,'' Mr. Sanders said. ''Can you distinguish the bottom teachers? The answer is yes, too. But it would be risky to make decisions using information at the classroom level for teachers who are just in the middle. You might miss a lot that way.'' 
 The city's pilot program uses a statistical analysis to measure students' previous-year test scores, their numbers of absences and whether they receive special education services or free lunch, as well as class size, among other factors. 
 Based on all those factors, that analysis then sets a ''predicted gain'' for a teacher's class, which is measured against students' actual gains to determine how much a teacher has contributed to students' growth. 
 The two-page report for each teacher examines information both from one year and over three years. The information also compares the teacher with all other teachers in the city, and with teachers who have similar classrooms and experience levels. The second part of the report measures how well a teacher does with students with different skill levels, showing, for example, whether the teacher seems to work well with struggling students. 
 Mr. Cerf said officials expected to decide by the ''early summer'' whether they would use the analysis to evaluate individual teachers for tenure or other decisions, and if so, how they would do so. Such a decision would undoubtedly open up a legal battle with the teacher's union.

HEADLINE: Farewell Remarks by Los Angeles Editor

 BODY:
Following is the text of an e-mail message sent on Monday by James E. O'Shea after he was ousted as editor of The Los Angeles Times:
 I made these farewell remarks in the newsroom today and I wanted to share them with everyone in case they took off the holiday and were unable to attend. I wish all of you the best and thank you for all of the help you've given me over the last 14 months. 
 By now I am sure you have all heard I am leaving the Los Angeles Times after 14 months as editor of the paper. I will never forget the day that I walked into this newsroom, which was furious about the firing of my predecessor, Dean Baquet. As I entered the Globe Lobby, the security guard handed me a pass. It was good for one day. I remember thinking this was going to be one of the toughest days of my life. Actually, today is probably a little tougher. I am leaving here after making many great friends and before I got a chance to do everything that I wanted. But that's life and I accept it. 
 I know there's a lot of talk about why I am leaving so let me set the record straight. In discussions about the current and future budgets, it became clear that Publisher David Hiller and I didn't share a common vision for the future of the Los Angeles Times. In fact, we were far apart. So David decided he wanted a new editor. 
 As I've said on numerous occasions over the past 14 months, I intended to stay here and lead this newspaper to the greatness it deserves. But David decided he wanted to terminate my employment and get another editor. I wish the new editor the best. 
 Although I didn't really accomplish all of the goals that I set when I arrived, I know that this newsroom today is better off than when I walked into the door, and I am proud of all that we did together. We've accomplished a lot in just 14 months. When I came to this newsroom, I pledged to maintain the quality of the LA Times, and I did, even though I had to cut budgets and shrink the staff.
 Despite those cutbacks, we successfully transformed this place into a true interactive newsroom with a web site that is far more successful than when I came. In fact, traffic on LATimes.com was up by a staggering 187 million page views over December 2006, an extraordinary achievement and one that should generate pride in our ranks. Our coverage of the fires that's truly worthy of a Pulitzer Prize is just one example of why record numbers of print and online readers depend on this newsroom. During my tenure, we also turned around a Sunday magazine that was drowning in red ink when I arrived; it's now rebounding and is in the black. With a modest investment in new resources, we created a new fashion section that generates millions in new print and online ad revenues and a successful new Calendar weekend section. The formula for success? A small investment in new resources more than pays for itself with added revenues. 
 We also created a new multi-media Guide section and web site; we redesigned Travel; we stopped the bleeding in circulation by being one of four papers in the country whose daily circulation was up in the last reporting period; and we broke news, the heartbeat of a newsroom, lots of it. The Sheriff Corona story; the diversion of U.S. anti-terrorism aid in Pakistan; I could go on and on. The quality of the paper under my time as editor didn't decline. I am proud of that given the financial pressures we faced. And most important, there's a talented stable management team in place that cares about the news that flows out to the public under the name of the Los Angeles Times.
 This is an incredibly talented newsroom and I've really enjoyed getting to know many of you. I think Steve Lopez is the best daily newspaper columnist in the nation, one of a few that I would compare favorably to Mike Royko. And that's saying a lot for someone from Chicago. There are lots of others who I could name but I don't have the time. I didn't get the time or opportunity to get to know some of you better and I regret that. One criticism I accept is that I spent too much time in my office and not enough time in the trenches, where I belong. So I apologize if I seemed a bit remote. As anyone who knows me well will tell you, that is not like me. I didn't make enough time to do what I'm really good at: rolling up my sleeves and editing a story.
 This is a tough time in the company and the industry. I understand that. I spent much of my career covering business and economics. I understand the realities of the bottom line. I am not some naive, starry-eyed journalist who can't accept economic reality. I know you have to cut back in hard times. I've done that more often than I care to mention. I also know this is a time of transition with change sweeping throughout the industry. But when you don't agree with the future course of the newspaper it's best to simply move on. There are plenty of other challenges out therefor me and I don't intend to sit around idle. There are bike rides to be had, books to write and hopefully another opportunity or two to make a difference. I am not a quitter.
 One thing I want put on the record, though, is that I disagree completely with the way that this company allocates resources to its newsrooms, not just here but at Tribune newspapers all around the country. That system is at the core of my disagreements with David. I think the current system relies too heavily on voodoo economics and not enough on the creativity and resourcefulness of journalists. We journalists have our faults, but we also have a lot to offer. Too often we've been dismissed as budgetary adolescents who can't be trusted to conserve our resources. That is wrong. Journalists and not accountants should seize responsibility for the financial health of our newspapers so journalists can make decisions about the size of our staffs and how much news remains in our papers and web sites.
 The biggest challenge we face -- journalists and dedicated newspaper folks alike is to overcome this pervasive culture of defeat, the psychology of surrender that accepts decline as inevitable. This mindset plagues our business and threatens our newspapers and livelihoods. I believe that when Sam Zell understands how asinine the current budgetary system is, he will change it for the better, because he is a smart businessman and he understands the value of wise investment. A dollar's worth of smart investment is worth far more than a barrel of budget cuts.
 This company, indeed, this industry, must invest more in solid, relevant journalism. We must integrate the speed and agility of the Internet with the news judgment and editorial values of the newsroom, values that are more important than ever as the hunger for news continues to surge and gossip pollutes the information atmosphere. Even in hard times, wise investment -- not retraction -- is the long-term answer to the industry's troubles. We must build on our core strength, which is good, accurate reporting, the backbone of solid journalism, the public service that helps people make the right decisions about their increasingly complex lives. We must tell people what they want to know and -- even more important -- what they might not want to know, about war, politics, economics, schools, corruption and the thoughts and deeds of those who lead us. We need to tell readers more about Barack Obama and less about Britney Spears. We must give a voice to those who can't afford a megaphone. And we must become more than a marketing slogan. I know I can rely on this newsroom to do this.
 Lastly I want to make it clear that I didn't quit. Anyone in a top newsroom management job during tough times always wrestles with a crucial question: Where is the line? At what point do you go from ''I can deal with this'' to ''this is simply wrong. '' When I was Managing Editor of the Chicago Tribune, I always thought my line was 600 newsroom employees. If the publisher demanded cuts that would take the newsroom below that level, I would leave because I felt staffing would slip to a level that would not allow me to sustain the quality newspaper that the community deserved. The Trib had 610 people in the newsroom when I left.
 So when I got here, I wondered anew: Where's my line: Would it be a newsroom of 800 people? 700? But then I realized the folly of that kind of thinking. I'd been around the accountants and their ''metrics'' too long. The line you draw is this: Do I believe in the course we've set for the future? If the answer is Yes, if I thought the LA Times could resolve its problems by getting smaller and smaller, by being gradually diminished, then I would stay. If not, (and I don't) then I told myself to take a stand and say enough is enough. If you have to consider closing foreign bureaus and cutting back in other parts of the paper to free up the money needed to cover the Olympics and the most historic political campaign in modern times, well to me that's no plan for the future, that is not serving the interest of readers. It is simply stupid. 
 Even though we face tough and demanding times and I sympathize with those who face daunting revenue challenges, I don't believe that we will succeed long term by giving up; by taking steps that I think will gradually diminish newspapers. I decided to take my stand and say: Change the way we do things. I made that decision and I will live with the consequences. And when I walk through the Globe Lobby for the last time, I can guarantee you that I won't regret taking that stand. I believe history will prove me right. When this industry stops relying so much on cuts and starts investing in Journalism, it will prosper because it will be serving the best interests of our readers. That's when we will prosper. I wish you all the best and with that it's time to say of my tenure here: Dash 30 Dash.

HEADLINE: Pentagon Weighs TOP IRAQ GENERAL AS CHIEF OF NATO

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON and ERIC SCHMITT

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Pentagon is considering Gen. David H. Petraeus for the top NATO command later this year, a move that would give the general, the top American commander in Iraq, a high-level post during the next administration but that has raised concerns about the practice of rotating war commanders. 
 A senior Pentagon official said that it was weighing ''a next assignment for Petraeus'' and that the NATO post was a possibility. ''He deserves one and that has also always been a highly prestigious position,'' the official said. ''So he is a candidate for that job, but there have been no final decisions and nothing on the timing.'' 
 The question of General Petraeus's future comes as the Pentagon is looking at changing several top-level assignments this year. President Bush has been an enthusiastic supporter of General Petraeus, whom he has credited with overseeing a troop increase and counterinsurgency plan credited with reducing the sectarian violence in Iraq, and some officials say the president would want to keep General Petraeus in Iraq as long as possible. 
 In one approach under discussion, General Petraeus would be nominated and confirmed for the NATO post before the end of September, when Congress is expected to break for the presidential election. He might stay in Iraq for some time after that before moving to the alliance's headquarters in Brussels, but would take his post before a new president takes office. 
 If General Petraeus is shifted from the post as top Iraq commander, two leading candidates to replace him are Lt. Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, who is running the classified Special Operations activities in Iraq, and Lt. Gen. Peter W. Chiarelli, a former second-ranking commander in Iraq and Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates's senior military assistant. 
 By this fall, General Petraeus would have served 19 months in command in Iraq and would have accumulated more than 47 months of service in Iraq in three tours there since 2003. In the NATO job, General Petraeus would play a major role in shaping the cold-war-era alliance's identity, in coping with an increasingly assertive Russia and in overseeing the allied-led mission in Afghanistan. 
 General Petraeus, 55, has been criticized by Democratic lawmakers opposed to Mr. Bush's decision to send additional combat forces to Iraq. A NATO post would give him additional command experience in an important but less politically contentious region, potentially positioning him as a strong candidate in a few years to serve as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, several military officials said. They and some others who discussed the potential appointment declined to be identified because they were speaking about an internal personnel matter.
 Some experts, however, say General Petraeus's departure would jeopardize American efforts in Iraq, especially since the No. 2 officer in Iraq, Lt. Gen. Raymond T. Odierno, is scheduled to complete his tour and leave Iraq in mid-February. 
 General Petraeus ''should stay at least through this year,'' said Anthony Cordesman, a military specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ''We really need military continuity in command during this period in which we can find out whether we can transition from tactical victory to some form of political accommodation.
 ''We have in Petraeus and Crocker the first effective civil-military partners we have had in this war,'' Mr. Cordesman added, referring to Ryan C. Crocker, the United States ambassador in Baghdad. Gen. George W. Casey Jr., General Petraeus's predecessor, served nearly three years in the top Iraq job before becoming Army chief of staff.
 There has been speculation that General Petraeus's next post might be as head of the Central Command, which has responsibility for the Middle East region. That would enable him to continue to influence events in Iraq while overseeing the military operation in Afghanistan and developing a strategy to deal with Iran. The Central Command post is currently held by Adm. William J. Fallon. Admiral Fallon, through a spokesman, denied that he intended to retire from the military in the next several months. 
 General Petraeus, through a spokesman, declined to comment on a possible NATO assignment. Geoff Morrell, the senior Defense Department spokesman, said no decision had been made. 
 ''Trying to guess General Petraeus's next assignment is the most popular parlor game in the Pentagon these days,'' Mr. Morrell said. ''Where and when the general goes next is up to Secretary Gates and President Bush, and they have not yet decided those matters. However, they very much appreciate his outstanding leadership in Iraq and believe he has much more to contribute to our nation's defense whenever his current assignment comes to an end.''
 Of the potential successors for General Petraeus, Generals McChrystal and Chiarelli would bring contrasting styles and backgrounds to the fight. General McChrystal has spent much of his career in the Special Operations forces. He commands those forces in Iraq, which have conducted raids against Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, the mainly Iraqi group that American intelligence says has foreign leadership, and against Shiite extremists, including cells believed to be backed by Iran. 
 In June 2006, Mr. Bush publicly congratulated General McChrystal on the airstrike that killed Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the Jordanian terrorist who was the head of Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia. The Pentagon does not officially acknowledge the existence of some of the classified units that General McChrystal leads, and Mr. Bush's comments were a rare acknowledgment of the role those troops played in a high-level mission. 
 General McChrystal, a 53-year-old West Point graduate, also commanded the 75th Ranger Regiment and served tours in Saudi Arabia during the Persian Gulf war in 1991 and in Afghanistan as chief of staff of the military operation there in 2001 and 2002. 
 He was criticized last year when a Pentagon investigation into the accidental shooting death of Cpl. Pat Tillman by fellow Army Rangers in Afghanistan held the general accountable for inaccurate information provided by Corporal Tillman's unit in recommending him for a Silver Star. The information wrongly suggested that Corporal Tillman, a professional football player whose decision to enlist in the Army after the Sept. 11 attacks drew national attention, had been killed by enemy fire. 
 General Chiarelli's strengths rest heavily on his reputation as one of the most outspoken proponents of a counterinsurgency strategy that gives equal or greater weight to social and economic actions aimed at undermining the enemy as it does to force of arms. General Chiarelli, 57, has served two tours in Iraq, first as head of the First Calvary Division, where he commanded 38,000 troops in securing and rebuilding Baghdad, and later as the second-ranking American officer in Iraq before becoming the senior military aide to Mr. Gates. 
 In a 2007 essay in Military Review, he wrote: ''Unless and until there is a significant reorganization of the U.S. government interagency capabilities, the military is going to be the nation's instrument of choice in nation-building. We need to accept that reality instead of resisting it, as we have for much of my career.''
 General Petraeus's last post in Europe was as a senior officer for the NATO force in Bosnia, where he served a tour in 2001 and 2002. ''He did a great job for me as a one-star in Bosnia,'' said Gen. Joseph W. Ralston, who served as NATO commander at the time and has since retired. ''He would have the credibility to keep Afghanistan focused for NATO.''

CORRECTION-DATE: January 24, 2008

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article on Monday about a change of commanders under consideration by the Pentagon misspelled the designation of an Army unit previously commanded by Lt. Gen. Peter W. Chiarelli, who might be selected to replace Gen. David H. Petraeus later this year as the top commander in Iraq. It is the First Cavalry Division, not Calvary.

HEADLINE: In Europe, Apple Faces Hurdles to iTunes Movie Rentals

BYLINE: By ERIC PFANNER

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
After introducing an online film rental business for American consumers last week, the chief executive of Apple, Steven P. Jobs, said he expected that the service would be expanded into international markets later this year.
 But trying to establish a European version of the iTunes movie rental service, which allows users to stream films or television shows to their computers or televisions, will not be easy.
 Apple will have to confront legal and regulatory hurdles, copyright challenges, scheduling conflicts and technological issues, reminders that the European media landscape remains a patchwork of individual countries, rather than the single market that the European Commission envisions. 
 ''The biggest challenge that we have is just the structure of the market,'' said Kevin Obi, senior vice president for digital assets at NBC Universal in London, which has licensed shows to several online video-on-demand services.
 Because of the difficulty of setting up cross-border services, many participants in the nascent market for digital film rentals or downloads in Europe operate in only one or a handful of countries.
 They include MK2, a French movie theater owner; Lovefilm, a DVD rental company in Britain that expanded into digital downloads; and Glowria, a similar business in France. 
 Last month, Microsoft expanded a service that allows users to download movies over its Xbox 360 video game console, opening up in Britain, France, Germany and Ireland, about a year after starting it in the United States.
 The European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, warned this month that there were significant barriers to developing digital media distribution in its 27 member countries. And Viviane Reding, the commissioner who oversees media, said that by midyear she would propose ways to make it easier to sell content online, including efforts to streamline digital commerce across borders.
 ''Europe's content sector is suffering under its regulatory fragmentation, under its lack of clear, consumer-friendly rules for accessing copyright-protected online content, and serious disagreements between stakeholders about fundamental issues'' like copying of digital works, Ms. Reding said in a statement.
 One problem she cited was the need for content distributors to secure individual licenses to films and other copyrighted material in every country in which they planned to do business. The commission said it would examine ways to encourage rights holders, including movie studios, to issue ''multiterritory'' licenses.
 While pan-European approaches might seem desirable in Brussels, that is not always the case in national capitals, particularly in smaller countries fearful about the decline of their own cultural industries. 
 European regulators, media companies, telecommunications providers and ''collecting societies,'' which gather royalties for copyright holders, battled for years over how to license digital music for pan-European use. Some artists and politicians have objected to efforts by the European Commission two years ago to ease music licensing by requiring collecting societies, which used to have national monopolies, to compete with each other across boundaries.
 Another difficulty for European digital distributors is the system of ''windows,'' or staggered schedules, that governs the release of films in different formats, from the cinema to DVDs to pay TV to video on demand and, finally, television.
 The release windows can vary widely from country to country. In Britain, many Hollywood films are released at the same time as in the United States, or not long afterward. In other European countries, there may be a lag of several months. 
 Some movie studios -- like Warner Brothers, in a deal with the Belgian cable company Belgacom -- have experimented with simultaneous release of films on DVD and video on demand; elsewhere, including France, there is a significant gap between the DVD and video-on-demand release.
 Apple declined to discuss the timetable for its planned movie rental service in Europe.
 But the company may already be more familiar than many other companies with the intricacies of European content licensing, having recently settled an investigation by the European Commission into the pricing policies on its iTunes music store. Apple recently agreed to lower its prices on the British iTunes to the levels in the euro zone but blamed record companies for the discrepancy.
 Despite the challenges that Apple and others will face, the European Commission predicts that revenue from digital sales of ''creative content,'' including films, music and video games, will rise to 8.3 billion euros in 2010 from 1.8 billion euros in 2005, or to about $12.2 billion from $2.6 billion, across the European Union.
 Some of the biggest beneficiaries may be local experts who can help the likes of Apple negotiate the legal and regulatory minefields. 
 Nick Thomas, European media industry analyst at JupiterResearch in London, said, ''If you're an intellectual property lawyer, there's probably a lot of money to be made over the next few years.''

HEADLINE: For Clinton, Government as Economic Prod

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT

 BODY:
Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton said that if she became president, the federal government would take a more active role in the economy to address what she called the excesses of the market and of the Bush administration.
 In one of her most extensive interviews about how she would approach the economy, Mrs. Clinton laid out a view of economic policy that differed in some ways from that of her husband, Bill Clinton. Mr. Clinton campaigned on his centrist views, and as president, he championed deficit reduction and trade agreements. 
 Reflecting what her aides said were very different conditions today, Mrs. Clinton put her emphasis on issues like inequality and the role of institutions like government, rather than market forces, in addressing them.
 She said that economic excesses -- including executive-pay packages she characterized as often ''offensive'' and ''wrong'' and a tax code that had become ''so far out of whack'' in favoring the wealthy -- were holding down middle-class living standards. 
 Interviewed between campaign appearances in Los Angeles on Thursday, she said those problems were also keeping the United States economy from growing as quickly as it could. 
 ''If you go back and look at our history, we were most successful when we had that balance between an effective, vigorous government and a dynamic, appropriately regulated market,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ''And we have systematically diminished the role and the responsibility of our government, and we have watched our market become imbalanced.''
 She added: ''I want to get back to the appropriate balance of power between government and the market.''
 In the last two weeks, Mrs. Clinton has devoted most of her public remarks to the economy, and she won the New Hampshire primary and the Nevada caucus largely because of support from households making less than $50,000 a year, according to polls conducted by Edison/Mitofsky. 
 Mrs. Clinton's approach to the economy would have three main components. She would roll back the Bush tax cuts for households with incomes over $250,000 while creating more tax breaks below that threshold; impose closer scrutiny on financial markets, including the investments being made by foreign governments in the United States; and raise spending on job-creating projects like the development of alternative energy.
 ''We've done it in previous generations,'' she said, alluding to large-scale public projects like the interstate highway system and the space program. ''But we've got to have a plan.''
 Using blunt and at times populist language in the interview, Mrs. Clinton, Democrat of New York, tried to steer a course between the often business-friendly themes embraced by her husband and the straight populism that John Edwards, the former senator from North Carolina, has used in his presidential campaign this year. Senator Barack Obama, Mrs. Clinton's main rival for the Democratic nomination, has also begun using more of her kitchen-table language in recent days.
 Although the two Clintons share similar views on a wide range of economic issues, she has long been more skeptical about the benefits of freer trade and other aspects of a free-market economy. While he peppered his 1992 campaign speeches with both populism and calls for personal responsibility, including welfare reform, she talks less about irresponsibility among individuals and more about irresponsibility in corporate America and the government.
 Perhaps the bigger difference, though, is that Mr. Clinton was running for president when the federal budget deficit was much larger than it is now and the United States seemed to be falling behind Western Europe and Japan in economic competitiveness. Mrs. Clinton is running when the economy has grown at a healthy clip for six years but incomes for most Americans have barely outpaced inflation.
 Republicans say that her tax increases on the affluent and her spending proposals would increase the deficit, but Mrs. Clinton's advisers respond that she, like her husband, is a fiscal conservative. They add that reducing the deficit is no longer sufficient, because today's problems have less to do with the size of the economic pie than the way it is divided.
 ''Inequality is growing,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ''The middle class is stalled. The American dream is premised on a growing economy where people are in a meritocracy and, if they're willing to work hard, they will realize the fruits of their labor.''
 Mrs. Clinton's approach involves programs narrowly focused to deal with specific problems, a strategy that economists say has pluses and minuses. Her proposal for short-term economic stimulus, centered more on home-heating and mortgage subsidies than a broad tax rebate, has generally received lower marks from economists than Mr. Obama's plan, which emphasizes immediate tax rebates to most workers. 
 The Clinton plan ''has moving parts'' and is ''more complicated,'' said Robert D. Reischauer, president of the Urban Institute and former director of the Congressional Budget Office. ''It's not as clear the stimulus would get into the system rapidly.''
 Mrs. Clinton, whose campaign initiated the interview, can speak in both fine detail and sweeping historical terms about the economy -- almost as would a policy adviser, which she essentially was for a long time. When talking about the middle class, she divides the decades since World War II into two periods, using the same cutoff point that many economists do.
 In the first period, from 1946 to 1973, the pay of most workers rose steadily. The income of the median family -- the one earning less than half of all other families and more than half of all others -- more than doubled during those years, to almost $50,000, in inflation-adjusted terms, according to Census Bureau data analyzed by the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal group in Washington.
 Since 1973, the income of the median family has grown only about 25 percent.
 During the earlier period, Mrs. Clinton said, the share of workers in labor unions grew, allowing workers to win raises and benefits that they can rarely win on their own. Marginal tax rates on the affluent were ''confiscatory'' by today's standards, she said. (In the early 1970s, the top rate, which applied to income above $1 million in today's terms, was 70 percent; the top rate now is 35 percent.)
 Jobs once paid enough that only one parent in many families needed to work, saving them from expenses like day care. And not only did the federal government invest in public goods like the highway system, but companies also invested more in communities than they do today. In Rochester, for example, Kodak helped build hospitals and schools.
 ''You had a corporate ethos, that, because of the more self-contained American economy, was really focused on community,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ''There was a sense of multiple obligations. It wasn't just to one's shareholders. It was also to one's employees, to one's community.''
 Mrs. Clinton mentioned technological change, which has eliminated the need for many blue-collar jobs, as well as global trade, which studies suggest may be holding down the wages of some Americans.
 But when discussing the causes of the middle-class wage slowdown, she tends to focus not on market-based changes, like technology and trade, but on institutions, like unions and the government.
 Her first priority, she said, would be changing the tax code. She has proposed tax credits for college tuition, retirement savings, health care and alternative energy use, most of which would go to lower- and middle-income families. She would also raise the top marginal rate to 39.6 percent, its level for much of her husband's administration. Increasing high-end tax rates would bring in $52 billion a year, her campaign says, and help pay for some of her other proposals. 
 ''It's shocking that there is such a continuing political pressure to lower tax rates on the wealthy, when so much of what we look back on now with nostalgia and pride,'' she said, referring to the decades immediately after World War II, ''was at a time when those who were well off were paying a significantly higher percentage of their income.''
 She said she would also use the White House bully pulpit to inveigh against the current level of executive pay. Though it is difficult to reduce such pay with new laws, she said, she wants to consider proposals that law school and business school professors have made along these lines.
 ''We have this class now of professional corporate managers who are not the creators of the corporation -- they very rarely had anything to do with starting the business or building it up,'' she said. ''And then they come in and they believe their No. 1 obligation is to secure the biggest possible pay package at the expense at everybody else.''
 On this subject, she sounds very much like Mr. Edwards, yet, unlike him, she has still received considerable support from top executives. She has been endorsed by John J. Mack, the chief executive of Morgan Stanley; Peter Chernin, president of the News Corporation; and Lloyd C. Blankfein, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, who received a $67.9 million bonus last year.
 David Bonior, Mr. Edwards's campaign manager, said her support from Wall Street suggested that she would be as friendly to corporate America as her husband was. 
 Still, if Mrs. Clinton is elected, she might bring the toughest regulatory scrutiny of any president in a generation. Mr. Clinton nudged the Democratic Party toward a more laissez-faire economic policy, and President Bush has gone considerably further in this direction.
 ''I just believe strongly that we are in great need of a total overhaul,'' she said, arguing that the Bush administration has outsourced too many functions and damaged the federal government's competence.
 Last March, when many officials in the administration and at the Federal Reserve were saying that the housing slump would not be too severe, she warned in a speech about ''trouble signs below the horizon'' with subprime mortgages. She has suggested that she would have been more willing to crack down on some lending practices than the current administration has.
 But perhaps the most telling example of her approach is how she would try to clean up the mortgage problems. She has called for a 90-day halt to foreclosures on homes with subprime mortgages and a five-year freeze in the interest rates on all subprime mortgages, many of which are scheduled to jump.
 The proposal would most likely reduce the number of coming foreclosures. But it would also potentially reward real estate speculators and others who took out mortgages they could not afford. In the process, it could raise interest rates for everyone else, economists say, by forcing banks to rewrite the terms of loans retroactively and to lose money on some.
 Her plan goes significantly further than Mr. Obama's. She decided, in effect, that the downsides of rewarding irresponsible borrowing was outweighed by the benefits of reducing foreclosures.
 She said she could ''understand totally'' the frustration of people who did not take out such loans and now wonder why the government would help those who did. ''What I'm trying to do,'' she said, ''is practically stabilize the patient so we can begin to try to cure this mess that everybody got us into.''
 If she were to win the Democratic nomination and the general election, she would most likely take office at a similar economic moment as her husband, with the economy struggling to emerge from a downturn. In 1993 -- with Mrs. Clinton playing a role that Bob Woodward later described as ''de facto chief of staff'' -- Mr. Clinton pushed through an economic plan without a single Republican vote.
 Many analysts say that plan played a role in the Democrats' loss of Congress the next year, but it is also widely credited with helping lay the groundwork for the 1990s boom. Mrs. Clinton suggested that she would be willing to take a similar approach in 2009.
 ''You try to find common ground, insofar as possible. But if you really believe, you have to manage the economy,'' she said. ''You have to stake a lot of your presidency on it. Because at the beginning is when you're strongest.''

HEADLINE: Spitzer Plans Smaller Increase in School Aid to City

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: ALBANY 

 BODY:
New York City schools are likely to receive $100 million less in operating aid than the city expected in the budget that Gov. Eliot Spitzer will unveil on Tuesday. 
 ''This is a difficult budget year,'' Paul Francis, the governor's director of operations, said in an interview. ''We simply had to make hard choices. In this area, as in all areas, we have told our friends in the educational community that we would be making hard choices across the board.''
 The governor's proposed budget for the fiscal year starting April 1 does not give the city's schools less money than before, but it gives them less than the expected $530 million in additional aid for school operations. 
 The new aid is part of a four-year plan to resolve a long court fight over school financing. Administration officials say they remain committed to the four-year goal. 
 Mr. Francis, above, said the administration also planned changes in the way aid is disbursed, with less tied to accountability goals like reducing class sizes. 
 Further, he said, the administration will propose changing the distribution of so-called high-tax education aid; Senate Republicans have added that aid to the budget in recent years, largely for Long Island, where homeowners have some of the highest property tax bills in the state. 
 ''Less of it goes to Long Island,'' Mr. Francis said, ''more of it goes to other counties.''
 The changes could set off a fight with the Legislature. 
 ''Clearly it could have been a lot worse,'' said Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver. ''This is still a record increase in school aid.''
 But John E. McArdle, a spokesman for the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, said, ''We will not stand for any unfair school aid distribution that shortchanges upstate, Long Island or New York City.''
 The administration will also propose changing the timeline the city uses for submitting requests for financing school construction -- funds that are separate from school operating money -- to bring the city in line with the rest of the state. If that plan is approved, more money would be available for operating aid, offsetting much of the $100 million shortfall. 
 But the proposal could face resistance from Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's administration and legislators from New York City, since the current system works to the city's advantage. 
 Statewide, increases in school operating aid will be pared back to $1.18 billion from the previous plan of $1.25 billion. If the new proposal on construction aid does not pass, new operating money could drop below $1.1 billion.
 Education and labor leaders say they will appeal to the Legislature but acknowledged that in the grim economic climate, the cuts could have been far worse. 
 ''As much as we're going to fight for the restoration, I want to give him credit,'' Randi Weingarten, the president of the United Federation of Teachers, said of the governor. 
 Referring to Mr. Spitzer's predecessor, George E. Pataki, she said: ''Pataki put cuts in. Spitzer is not cutting, even in these very troublesome economic times. He's just saying that he doesn't think he can meet the expectation that was put out.''
 Fighting Off Cuts
 As usual, Big Pharma has been a prodigious donor to legislative campaigns in recent months. That is no surprise, since the Spitzer administration is expected to push for significant Medicaid savings in the way the state does bulk purchasing of drugs. 
 In the campaign finance filing period that ended on Jan. 11, Eli Lilly, AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline and Merck cumulatively donated $67,500 to central accounts maintained by Senate Republicans and $29,500 to Assembly Democrats. 
 Bruno Largess
 With his usual wink and nod, the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, turned a series of recent articles by a Buffalo News reporter, Tom Precious, on its head. 
 The stories highlighted how much state aid has gone into Mr. Bruno's Albany-area district during his dozen years as leader, compared with other parts of upstate -- like Buffalo. But Mr. Bruno, above, seemed positively buoyant last week when he read passages from the series to a chamber of commerce in the Albany area. 
 ''Welcome to Bruno country, built by generosity,'' he read, beginning a passage describing how his own name is omnipresent in his district. ''Thank yous to Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno are not hard to find. He is honored for his largess with taxpayers' money.'' 
 The senator paused to allow the laughter from several hundred local businesspeople to subside. 
 ''What, is that supposed to be wrong?'' Mr. Bruno said, adding, ''I tell you, I think Tom was being kind, because he said, 'Fly into Albany Airport, there's a bust of Bruno. Drive down I-90, there's an exit marked for the Bruno Stadium. Again, I think Tom was being nice.''
 Expect the largess to continue. Mr. Bruno noted that the governor did not talk much about the capital region in a recent speech on upstate economic development. 
 ''It seems that Albany has had its share, and maybe we'd have to look past Albany,'' Mr. Bruno said of the speech. ''Well, guess what,'' he said, ''it's not going to happen.'' 
 What, No Fund-Raising?
 Comptroller Thomas P. DiNapoli has not raised campaign money since he took office 11 months ago. 
 ''My desire was to turn things around here, in terms of the credibility of the office,'' he said, adding, ''Spending a lot of time on fund-raising didn't seem consistent with that.''
 Mr. DiNapoli, who had been an assemblyman, was installed by the Legislature after Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi pleaded guilty to a felony and resigned. 
 Several investigations continue into the office's dealings with investment firms while Mr. Hevesi was comptroller. 
 Mr. DiNapoli, above, said he was still drawing up voluntary fund-raising guidelines for himself, including following the governor's practice of limiting contributions to $10,000, less than 20 percent of the legal limit. 
 He would not rule out continuing the practice of his predecessors, who raised much of their money from investment firms that do business with the state, or want to. 
 ''The monetary limit does a lot to deal with that,'' Mr. DiNapoli said. ''In the absence of public financing, we need to come up with a sensible approach to raising the money you need without compromising the office.''

HEADLINE: Thoroughly Unmodern McCain

BYLINE: By WILLIAM KRISTOL

 BODY:
In his victory speech after winning the South Carolina primary Saturday night, John McCain acknowledged the economic challenges we face, and then said: ''But nothing is inevitable in our country. We are the captains of our fate.''
 McCain comes from a generation that, in its youth, was made to memorize poetry. And when I was able to get in touch with him Sunday in Florida, he told me that one of the poems he had memorized in school was William Ernest Henley's ''Invictus'' (1875). McCain actually recited snatches of the poem in our cellphone conversation -- not something he does every day on the campaign trail, he pointed out. 
 In any case, here's Henley's Victorian warhorse:
 Out of the night that covers me, Black as the pit from pole to pole, I thank whatever gods may be For my unconquerable soul.
 In the fell clutch of circumstance I have not winced nor cried aloud, Under the bludgeonings of chance My head is bloody, but unbow'd.
 Beyond this place of wrath and tears Looms but the horror of the shade, And yet the menace of the years Finds, and shall find me, unafraid.
 It matters not how strait the gate, How charged with punishments the scroll, I am the master of my fate: I am the captain of my soul.
 The young Henley had written this following the amputation of his foot because of tubercular infection. He lived until age 53, apparently unbow'd and unafraid, a productive poet, critic and editor. (The one-legged Henley also served as an inspiration for his close friend Robert Louis Stevenson's ''Treasure Island'' character Long John Silver.) 
 One can see why ''Invictus'' might have appealed to the young McCain. One can see why snatches of it might have stuck in his mind while a prisoner of war, and after. But his allusion to its coda reminds us of what's so distinctive about McCain as a contemporary political figure: He's not thoroughly modern.
 In this he differs from his competitors. Mitt Romney is the very model of a modern venture capitalist. Mike Huckabee is the very model of a modern evangelical. Rudy Giuliani is the very model of a modern can-do executive. They are impressive modern men all. But John McCain is a not-so-modern type. One might call him a neo-Victorian -- rigid, self-righteous and moralizing, but (or rather and) manly, courageous and principled.
 Maybe a dose of this type of neo-Victorianism is what the 21st century needs. A fair number of Republican and independent voters seem to think so, if one can infer as much from their support of McCain at the polls. But, amazingly, a neo-Victorian straightforwardness might also turn out to be strategically smart.
 McCain has been the only Republican candidate who hasn't tried to out-think the process. Perhaps out of sheer necessity, after his campaign imploded last summer, he simply picked himself up and made his case to the voters in the various states.
 Meanwhile, the other G.O.P. candidates are creatures of our modern age of analysis and meta-analysis, and their campaigns have sometimes been too clever by half. Rudy Giuliani believed it would look bad to contest states he might not win. He therefore pulled back from Iowa, New Hampshire, Michigan and South Carolina -- and in the process surrendered his lead in Florida and nationally.
 Conservatives were excited about Fred Thompson last spring. But Thompson apparently decided it would be too simple to strike while the iron was hot. He never recovered. And Mike Huckabee, after an extraordinary run in the fall, brought on experienced campaign pros, changed his position on immigration, raised the issue of the Confederate flag -- and lost South Carolina.
 Meanwhile, trying to be clever, Mitt Romney left South Carolina and headed to Nevada, thinking he could get more attention for his expected victory in the caucus there. If he had stayed and campaigned in South Carolina, he still would have won Nevada. And he might have cost McCain enough votes that McCain would have lost South Carolina to Huckabee, a much better outcome for the Romney campaign. 
 Yesterday, on ''Fox News Sunday,'' using his most up-to-date talking points, Romney claimed to be an outside-the-Beltway candidate, by contrast with John McCain, ''who has been in Washington all [his] life.''
 Romney might have paused before charging McCain with being a prisoner of Washington. In the late 1960s and early 70s, while Romney was a missionary in France and a law and business student at Harvard, McCain wasn't living the good life here in the nation's capital. He was ''tied up at the time,'' as he once reminded the audience in a Republican candidates' debate, tied up and perhaps reciting to himself lines from ''Invictus.''

HEADLINE: Los Angeles Editor Ousted After Resisting Job Cuts

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
The top editor of The Los Angeles Times has been forced out for resisting newsroom budget cuts, executives at the paper said Sunday, marking the fourth time in less than three years that the highest-ranking editor or the publisher has left for that reason.
 The removal of the editor, James E. O'Shea, by the publisher, David D. Hiller, mirrors the odd spectacle of a little more than a year ago, when the previous publisher, Jeffrey M. Johnson, was fired for refusing to eliminate newsroom jobs as directed by the paper's owner, the Tribune Company. In each case, a longtime Tribune executive was expected to rein in costs at the paper, but instead sided with the newsroom and lost his job for it. 
 The departure of Mr. O'Shea appears to contradict statements by Samuel Zell, the Chicago real estate magnate who took over the company last month and is now its chairman and chief executive. Mr. Zell has criticized the previous regime of the financially troubled company for trying to improve the bottom line by cutting costs, and he has said that the path to profit lies in finding new revenue, not paring costs.
 Calls to Mr. O'Shea, Mr. Hiller and a spokeswoman for Mr. Zell were not returned. A Tribune spokesman referred inquiries to Nancy Sullivan, a spokeswoman for The Times, who said, ''I don't have any comment for you.'' 
 Officials at The Times said Mr. Hiller had ordered a $4 million cut in the newsroom budget. Some said he specifically sought to cut expenses related to covering the presidential campaign, a time when such expenses usually spike. Some editors and reporters said that Mr. Hiller told them in a meeting in November that he wanted to reduce staff somewhat by the end of 2008. 
 The shake-up came as a surprise to newsroom employees at The Times, several of whom said late last week that they had not heard about a clash between the editor and the publisher and did not have any indication that Mr. O'Shea's job was threatened.
 People at The Times said they did not know whether Mr. Hiller was acting on orders from company headquarters or on his own initiative; Mr. Zell has said he would allow each of the Tribune properties greater autonomy.
 The Times had a newsroom staff of more than 1,100 people at the start of this decade, but the number has declined to below 900, officials say. Its weekday circulation has dropped to about 800,000, from 1.1 million.
 Tribune, whose flagship is The Chicago Tribune, bought the Times Mirror Company in 2000, acquiring its crown jewel, The Los Angeles Times, one of the nation's largest newspapers and long regarded as one of the best. The $8 billion price was widely seen as inflated, particularly after recession struck the following year and newspaper ad revenues began a long decline.
 The relationship between the Los Angeles and Chicago offices has been troubled for much of the time since then. Chicago has demanded cost savings and higher profit -- officials at The Times say the paper still makes a healthy profit, despite its troubles -- and the view in Los Angeles has been that the new owners are slowly killing an asset they neither value nor understand.
 Tribune first brought in two well-regarded editors from outside, John S. Carroll and Dean P. Baquet, to run The Times. But after rounds of job cuts and demands for more, Mr. Carroll quit in 2005, and Mr. Baquet rose to the top spot.
 In late 2006, Mr. Johnson, the publisher, was fired along with Mr. Baquet for refusing to carry out more cuts. Mr. Baquet then rejoined The New York Times, which he had left in 2000 for the Los Angeles paper, as the Washington bureau chief and an assistant managing editor.
 With Mr. Baquet gone, Mr. O'Shea, the managing editor of The Chicago Tribune, went to Los Angeles to run the newsroom.
 Adding to the turmoil of the last few years has been the departure of two editors of The Times' editorial page, Michael Kinsley and Andres Martinez, after short tenures.
 It was not clear Sunday whether Mr. O'Shea's successor would come from within The Times, or when his departure took place.
 Tribune, one of the nation's largest media companies, also owns Newsday, The Baltimore Sun and other newspapers, as well as two dozen television stations, the Chicago Cubs baseball team and other properties.
 But as newspapers endure tough times, Tribune's papers have suffered even more than the industry as a whole. Through the first three quarters of last year, its profit was 53 percent below the same period a year earlier. 
 Newspapers generally have been cutting staff in recent years, especially those in California, which have been hit hard by the downturn in real estate and, in turn, real estate advertising.

HEADLINE: At Least 7 Killed in Violence Across Kenya

BYLINE: By JEFFREY GETTLEMAN

DATELINE: NAIROBI, Kenya 

 BODY:
At least seven people were killed in Kenya over the weekend in reverberations from last week's nationwide protests, and police officials have begun investigating the officer seen on television shooting an unarmed demonstrator, police officials said Sunday. 
 Four men were hacked to death in the slums ringing Nairobi, the capital, and three people died from arrow wounds while they were seeking shelter near a monastery in the western part of the country, said Eric Kiraithe, a spokesman for the Kenyan police.
 Kenya Television Network and other local news media outlets said the death toll from fighting at the monastery, which began Friday, was much higher, with as many as 22 people killed and dozens of homes burned to the ground. Witnesses said a group of more than 1,000 people attacked families who were trying to escape what appeared to be a cycle of ethnically driven violence.
 In Kisumu, where an unarmed protester was shot to death on Wednesday, a police investigation team began looking into the circumstances of the killing. Mr. Kiraithe said forensic experts had removed the bullet from the protester's body and were doing ballistic tests on the guns of officers at the scene. 
 Kenya Television Network had broadcast images of one officer apparently shooting the protester, who was dancing in the street and making faces at security agents. After the protester dropped to the ground, the officer ran up to him and kicked him several times with heavy boots. The protester later died. The officer has been suspended from duty, pending the outcome of the investigation, Mr. Kiraithe said.
 Kenya has been mired in turmoil and violence since the election on Dec. 27, in which Mwai Kibaki, the incumbent president, was declared the winner over Raila Odinga, the top opposition leader, despite widespread evidence of vote rigging.
 International pressure has been steadily building on Kenya's leaders to reach some sort of political compromise to end the crisis here, which has killed more than 650 people, displaced 250,000 and imperiled what had been a fast-growing economy. Several countries, including the United States, have threatened to cut aid. 
 Still, Mr. Kibaki and Mr. Odinga have refused even to meet. Last week, Mr. Kibaki appointed Kalonzo Musyoka, Kenya's vice president, to lead negotiations, but Mr. Odinga rejected him as a ''traitor'' and a ''Judas,'' referring to Mr. Musyoka's former position as a member of the opposition.
 On Sunday, Mr. Odinga said, ''I am ready to talk,'' but he reiterated his stance that he would not meet Mr. Musyoka and would negotiate with Mr. Kibaki only in the presence of international mediators, a condition that Mr. Kibaki has rebuffed.
 Mr. Odinga also urged his supporters, who responded to his calls last week for three days of protests, not to be violent. ''I don't want anyone killing in the name of tribalism,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Debunking the Reagan Myth

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Historical narratives matter. That's why conservatives are still writing books denouncing F.D.R. and the New Deal; they understand that the way Americans perceive bygone eras, even eras from the seemingly distant past, affects politics today.
 And it's also why the furor over Barack Obama's praise for Ronald Reagan is not, as some think, overblown. The fact is that how we talk about the Reagan era still matters immensely for American politics. 
 Bill Clinton knew that in 1991, when he began his presidential campaign. ''The Reagan-Bush years,'' he declared, ''have exalted private gain over public obligation, special interests over the common good, wealth and fame over work and family. The 1980s ushered in a Gilded Age of greed and selfishness, of irresponsibility and excess, and of neglect.'' 
 Contrast that with Mr. Obama's recent statement, in an interview with a Nevada newspaper, that Reagan offered a ''sense of dynamism and entrepreneurship that had been missing.'' 
 Maybe Mr. Obama was, as his supporters insist, simply praising Reagan's political skills. (I think he was trying to curry favor with a conservative editorial board, which did in fact endorse him.) But where in his remarks was the clear declaration that Reaganomics failed?
 For it did fail. The Reagan economy was a one-hit wonder. Yes, there was a boom in the mid-1980s, as the economy recovered from a severe recession. But while the rich got much richer, there was little sustained economic improvement for most Americans. By the late 1980s, middle-class incomes were barely higher than they had been a decade before -- and the poverty rate had actually risen. 
 When the inevitable recession arrived, people felt betrayed -- a sense of betrayal that Mr. Clinton was able to ride into the White House.
 Given that reality, what was Mr. Obama talking about? Some good things did eventually happen to the U.S. economy -- but not on Reagan's watch.
 For example, I'm not sure what ''dynamism'' means, but if it means productivity growth, there wasn't any resurgence in the Reagan years. Eventually productivity did take off -- but even the Bush administration's own Council of Economic Advisers dates the beginning of that takeoff to 1995.
 Similarly, if a sense of entrepreneurship means having confidence in the talents of American business leaders, that didn't happen in the 1980s, when all the business books seemed to have samurai warriors on their covers. Like productivity, American business prestige didn't stage a comeback until the mid-1990s, when the U.S. began to reassert its technological and economic leadership.
 I understand why conservatives want to rewrite history and pretend that these good things happened while a Republican was in office -- or claim, implausibly, that the 1981 Reagan tax cut somehow deserves credit for positive economic developments that didn't happen until 14 or more years had passed. (Does Richard Nixon get credit for ''Morning in America''?)
 But why would a self-proclaimed progressive say anything that lends credibility to this rewriting of history -- particularly right now, when Reaganomics has just failed all over again?
 Like Ronald Reagan, President Bush began his term in office with big tax cuts for the rich and promises that the benefits would trickle down to the middle class. Like Reagan, he also began his term with an economic slump, then claimed that the recovery from that slump proved the success of his policies. 
 And like Reaganomics -- but more quickly -- Bushonomics has ended in grief. The public mood today is as grim as it was in 1992. Wages are lagging behind inflation. Employment growth in the Bush years has been pathetic compared with job creation in the Clinton era. Even if we don't have a formal recession -- and the odds now are that we will -- the optimism of the 1990s has evaporated.
 This is, in short, a time when progressives ought to be driving home the idea that the right's ideas don't work, and never have.
 It's not just a matter of what happens in the next election. Mr. Clinton won his elections, but -- as Mr. Obama correctly pointed out -- he didn't change America's trajectory the way Reagan did. Why?
 Well, I'd say that the great failure of the Clinton administration -- more important even than its failure to achieve health care reform, though the two failures were closely related -- was the fact that it didn't change the narrative, a fact demonstrated by the way Republicans are still claiming to be the next Ronald Reagan. 
 Now progressives have been granted a second chance to argue that Reaganism is fundamentally wrong: once again, the vast majority of Americans think that the country is on the wrong track. But they won't be able to make that argument if their political leaders, whatever they meant to convey, seem to be saying that Reagan had it right.

HEADLINE: Republican Field Rides Full Force Into Florida Test

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY

DATELINE: POLK CITY, Fla. 

 BODY:
The Republican presidential contest entered a new phase on Sunday as the campaigns descended on Florida for the first primary in which all the candidates are participating full force, using as their stage a state famous for divisive election battles. 
 Four major candidates -- Senator John McCain, Mitt Romney, Rudolph W. Giuliani and Mike Huckabee -- all have a claim to different segments of the Republican electorate in this culturally and geographically diverse state. 
 And in a rare moment of political consensus, all of the campaigns see the Jan. 29 primary in Florida, the fourth most populous state in the nation, as the most important contest on the calendar to date. It is the gateway -- candidates hope it is a springboard -- to what will in effect be a national primary on Feb. 5, when more than 20 states will hold Republican nominating contests.
 ''All the candidates are playing there, and it really is going to be the last opportunity for national attention for a single victory,'' Alex Castellanos, a senior adviser to Mr. Romney, said of the Florida primary. 
 Mr. McCain, after shutting down his operation here during his campaign's financing crisis in the fall, opened six offices in the state on Sunday, and aides said he would begin advertising on Monday. Mr. McCain, of Arizona, plans a series of bus trips across the state, starting Monday morning in Central Florida.
 Mitt Romney, a former Massachusetts governor, returns to the airwaves on Wednesday; his commercials will include advertisements on Spanish-language television emphasizing how different this state is from those in which the candidates have campaigned before. Mr. Romney's aides said Sunday that he would spend every day in Florida until the state holds its primary. 
 Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York whose message over the weekend focused on taxes as much as on his signature terrorism theme, moved across Central Florida by bus on Sunday. It was his 48th day of campaigning in the state where Giuliani aides say his political future is on the line; his candidacy barely registered in the four nominating contests so far. 
 ''Florida is Rudy country, right?'' Mr. Giuliani said Sunday afternoon at a low-key town-hall-style meeting here. ''We've got to prove that.''
 But if Florida is posing an opportunity for all the candidates, it is also forcing them to make tough strategic choices about which voters might be most receptive to their appeals. 
 About 40 percent of this state's Republican voters have ties to the military, a group that has repeatedly proved supportive of Mr. McCain, who was a prisoner of war in Vietnam. That was especially true in South Carolina.
 About a quarter of the Republican voters in Florida are evangelical Christians. Though they are a force here, they are significantly less of one than they were in Iowa, where they powered Mr. Huckabee, a Baptist minister and former governor of Arkansas, to victory. Still, Mr. Huckabee's advisers said they thought evangelical support could be enough to carry him to victory in such a crowded field. 
 Mr. Huckabee could also be helped if Fred D. Thompson, the former senator from Tennessee who has sought support from social conservatives, decides to drop out after his weak showing on Saturday in South Carolina. 
 The large number of expatriate New Yorkers in South Florida is a key target for Mr. Giuliani, who is spending more time in that part of the state than Republicans normally do. Aides said they had compared voter files from New York and Florida to find former New Yorkers who had registered to vote in Miami-Dade County.
 About 10 percent of Republican voters here are Cuban-American, a group that Mr. Giuliani and Mr. McCain see as open to appeals that are based, in part, on promises of tough foreign policy. 
 A sizable proportion of Florida Republicans are Jewish. Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, an independent from Connecticut who is highly popular in Jewish communities in South Florida, is campaigning there for Mr. McCain.
 Republican officials said three of the candidates -- Mr. Romney, Mr. McCain and Mr. Giuliani -- had built up extensive organizations here, and tapped experts from the political machine created by Jeb Bush, the former governor. All have been pressing for one endorsement Republicans here believe could be valuable: that of Charlie Crist, the popular governor. Last year, Mr. McCain endorsed Mr. Crist and campaigned with him.
 Jim Greer, the Republican state chairman, said he thought Mr. Huckabee had the weakest political organization.
 ''I don't think he's been down here long enough to gain the support he needs in Florida,'' Mr. Greer said. ''But he's certainly going to be a player. I just don't see that he has the finances to compete in Florida.''
 The very diversity of the state -- as well as the rules of this particular primary, which is the first one this year open only to registered Republicans -- weighed over the campaigns as aides, meeting in Sunday-morning strategy sessions after Mr. McCain's victory in South Carolina on Saturday, wrestled with strategic challenges posed by the politically complicated state.
 Mr. Romney's advisers said they were fearful that a continuing decline in Mr. Giuliani's standing would send his previous supporters to Mr. McCain. These advisers argued that Mr. McCain would struggle to win Florida because he could not draw on votes from independents, who supported him in New Hampshire and South Carolina, and where his success was due in no small part to support from independent voters. 
 All of the candidates were considering whether Mr. McCain's victory in South Carolina would make up for the relative weaker organization he has here compared with Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Romney. So far in 2008, there has been little evidence that a victory in one state gives a candidate a lift going into the next one. 
 Polls in Florida suggest that Mr. Giuliani has lost the once-commanding lead that he held. 
 Mr. McCain's advisers said Sunday that their top goal was to marginalize Mr. Giuliani and try to transform this into a two-way race with Mr. Romney. They disputed the notion that Mr. McCain's relatively weak showing among Republicans in South Carolina and New Hampshire suggested he would be vulnerable to Mr. Romney here.
 McCain advisers said they were not concerned about that, but said Mr. McCain would emphasize cuts in taxes and government spending in an effort to bolster his Republican credentials.
 ''To say, 'McCain only got 3 in 10 Republicans in South Carolina, well hell, it was a seven-way race,'' said Charles Black, a senior adviser to Mr. McCain. ''We finished first. It doesn't matter if it's 3 out of 10. In Florida, we don't need 51 percent of the vote; we need to finish first.''
 Florida is torn by economic distress, and Mr. Giuliani over the weekend moved to set the agenda, attacking Mr. McCain and Mr. Romney for not supporting President Bush's tax cuts. Mr. Giuliani has focused mostly on the economy and a promise of tax cuts, slipping away from the antiterrorism message that was the central part of his failed television advertising strategy in New Hampshire.
 Mr. Giuliani has tried to differentiate himself from Mr. Romney and Mr. McCain by supporting a federal program to provide lower hurricane insurance rates. That issue has particular resonance in South Florida, where the memory of the disastrous hurricanes of 2005 remains raw.

HEADLINE: Radical Love Gets A Holiday

BYLINE: By SARAH VOWELL. 
Sarah Vowell is the author of ''Assassination Vacation'' and the forthcoming ''The Wordy Shipmates,'' about the New England Puritans.

 BODY:
IN 1983, Ronald Reagan signed a bill honoring the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. with a federal holiday. Reagan opposed it, but back then, in the olden times of checks and balances, the vote by 338 representatives and 78 senators establishing the holiday threatened certain veto override. 
 So there was the president in the White House Rose Garden pretending to enjoy turning this drain on the Gross National Product into law. Perhaps he comforted himself that the American people, who can turn something as dead serious as Memorial Day into a clambake, would somehow find a way to use a football season Monday venerating a murder victim to sleep off their beer and nachos hangovers of the preceding afternoon.
 Still, there's a pleasing symmetry in Reagan forking over a day to Dr. King. Both men owe their reputations to the Sermon on the Mount. The president's most enduring bequest might be a city-smiting drug war, but thanks to a nice smile and a biblical sound bite that's not how he's remembered. Reagan cribbed from the Gospel of Matthew via the Puritan John Winthrop to dream up his ''shining city on a hill'' legacy. And Americans in general and Republican presidential candidates in particular still believe in it, probably because they're not watching ''The Wire.'' 
 Here's what Dr. King got out of the Sermon on the Mount. On Nov. 17, 1957, in Montgomery's Dexter Avenue Baptist Church, he concluded the learned discourse that came to be known as the ''loving your enemies'' sermon this way: ''So this morning, as I look into your eyes and into the eyes of all of my brothers in Alabama and all over America and over the world, I say to you: 'I love you. I would rather die than hate you.' '' 
 Go ahead and re-read that. That is hands down the most beautiful, strange, impossible, but most of all radical thing a human being can say. And it comes from reading the most beautiful, strange, impossible, but most of all radical civics lesson ever taught, when Jesus of Nazareth went to a hill in Galilee and told his disciples, ''Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you.''
 The Bible is a big long book and Lord knows within its many mansions of eccentricity finding justification for literal and figurative witch hunts is as simple as pretending ''enhanced investigation technique'' is not a synonym for torture. I happen to be with Dr. King in proclaiming the Sermon on the Mount's call for love to be at the heart of Christian behavior, and one of us got a Ph.D in systematic theology. 
 I live in Lower Manhattan. In my seriously secular neck of the woods, Christians are often dismissed as those homophobes on the news hell-bent on keeping half the population of Chelsea out of the wedding pages. Once, I told a member of the fabled East Coast Media Elite that I was raised Pentecostal and he asked if that meant I grew up ''fondling snakes in trailers.'' 
 I replied: ''You know that book club you're in? Well, my church was a lot like that, except that we actually read the book.''
 Until my heathen Damascene moment during a ninth grade unit on Greek mythology -- my disbelief that a great civilization could actually believe in such far-fetched malarkey made me take a hard look at the virgin birth -- I was one of the meek majority of Christians who never make the news, who would never dream of judging or hating others because the primary occupation of a true Christian is self-loathing. (All that wretch-like-me, original sin talk meant I spent my entire childhood believing I was as depraved as Charles Manson when in reality I might have been the best-behaved 9-year-old of the 20th century.) 
 Because I am a culturally Christian atheist the same way my atheist Reform friends are culturally Jewish, I look forward to Martin Luther King's Birthday -- when the news momentarily replaces the rants of the faith-based spitfires with clips of what an actually Christlike Christian sounds like -- with the kind of fondness with which my pal Ben looks back on the decent, affectionate ideal that was his summer camp. 
 I have become just another citizen whose only religion is the freedom of religion and as such I patrol the wall of separation between church and state like some jumpy East German guarding Checkpoint Charlie back before Ronald Reagan single-handedly tore it down. 
 Which is why I am relieved that journalists and voters keep asking Mike Huckabee, the Republican presidential candidate, what he meant 10 years ago when he told a meeting of his fellow Baptists, ''I hope we answer the alarm clock and take this nation back for Christ.'' That is a curiously unconstitutional opinion for someone seeking the job of defending the Constitution, not to mention historically inaccurate considering the mostly deist founders were about as spiritual as the original cast of ''Hair.'' 
 But I am also relieved when Mr. Huckabee occasionally blurts out some Sunday School sentiment about how he doesn't think a poor child should have to sleep in a car. Of course, this whiff of Jesus makes some of his fellow Republicans turn on him as if he's Michael Dukakis. Because they fear that trying to find the homeless homes translates into raising the taxes they must render unto Caesar.
 Whoever wins the presidential election this year will be a Christian. (Unless of course it's that one guy who is a member of a Muslim sleeper cell. Just when you think the electoral process couldn't get any more stupid....) So the rest of us might as well suck it up and see if we can pick the Christian who is, if incapable of loving his or her enemies, the one who seems least likely to drum up a bunch of extra, new enemies to hate.
 In this age of a slower, grubbier mutually assured destruction, when no one's typed the word ''nonviolence'' since the typewriter, it's worth reading Dr. King's quarrel with the cold war's MAD ploy. In the ''loving your enemies'' text he tells a pretty little parable about how one night his brother A. D. drove him to Tennessee. Infuriated by all the other cars' brights, A. D. vowed to crank his lights and blind the next driver passing by. Dr. King told him not to, that it would just get everybody killed. ''Somebody got to have some sense on this highway,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Gauging Reality That Grew From a Dream

BYLINE: By ANNE BARNARD

 BODY:
The leader of one of America's most venerable civil rights groups kicked off his annual celebration of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in what might have once seemed an unlikely fashion: by ringing the opening bell Friday morning at the Nasdaq stock exchange.
 Roy Innis, the national chairman of the Congress of Racial Equality, clapped and cheered beside Dennis Bassford, the chief executive of Moneytree Inc., a chain of check-cashing stores, as the towering video screen outside Nasdaq's media center beamed the scene onto Times Square. The stock exchange's chief marketing officer, John L. Jacobs, joked, ''It's your job to turn this market around!''
 At its dinner on Monday night in honor of Dr. King's birthday, the civil rights group plans to salute Mr. Bassford for providing access to credit for poor communities and spreading financial literacy, an important goal of the group. Niger Innis, the group's national spokesman and Roy Innis's son, explained, ''You want to have leverage in our society, the color is not black or white -- it's green.'' 
 As the federal holiday approached, many New Yorkers, from Caribbean business leaders to labor organizers taking aim at Starbucks, found a resonance in Dr. King's birthday that was almost post-racial. They talked about empowering the poor and the working class, and about identities more complex than just black and white. 
 Strikingly often in those discussions, they mentioned a name that they said had brought fresh meaning to the holiday: that of Senator Barack Obama, the first black candidate widely seen as having a shot at the presidency.
 ''Barack's campaign -- like him or not, support his policies or his politics or not -- the brilliance of this black man winning in Iowa and nearly winning in New Hampshire is a huge victory for Dr. King's dream,'' Niger Innis said. ''It doesn't mean that the fight is over, but the battlefield certainly has changed.''
 As the son of a white American mother and a black Kenyan father, with support from many upper-income white voters and a campaign not focused on racial issues or his racial identity, Senator Obama seems to some observers to embody Dr. King's emphasis on integration. To some, Mr. Obama's candidacy also recalls the way the civil rights leader expanded his focus on racism to include economic and foreign policy issues shortly before he was assassinated 40 years ago in Memphis, where he had gone to support a strike by sanitation workers.
 ''Dr. King had become very unpopular before his death, talking about things that black men did not have the right to talk about,'' George Hulse, an H.M.O. executive and board member of the Caribbean American Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said over bagels Friday at the chamber's King breakfast. 
 ''They could not talk about economic issues. They could not talk about international affairs. They could not talk about world issues,'' said Mr. Hulse, vice president of external affairs for Healthfirst. He recalled the controversy that Dr. King stirred with his ''Beyond Vietnam'' speech at Riverside Church in New York in 1967.
 But those subjects are now cornerstones of the Obama campaign, a campaign that Mr. Hulse said Dr. King's trailblazing had made possible.
 Many of the people who had Mr. Obama on their minds as Dr. King's birthday celebration approached emphasized that they had not decided whether to vote for him. His main opponent, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, also enjoys strong support among civil rights leaders and African-Americans. And many of the organizations that commemorate the holiday are nonprofit groups that by law cannot endorse candidates. 
 Rather, Mr. Obama's name came up alongside Dr. King's as people declared that the civil rights leader was no longer a symbol only for African-Americans, or as they expressed hope that the two senators -- a possible first female president and a possible first black president -- would resist temptations to focus the campaign on race and gender.
 Roy Innis said he was glad they seemed to have pulled back from a dust-up over Mrs. Clinton's recent remark that Dr. King's work came to fruition after President Lyndon B. Johnson pushed through the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
 ''It's so funny when someone tells the truth and they have to apologize for it,'' he said of Mrs. Clinton. ''L.B.J. knew the redneck opposition and busted their kneecaps and broke their arms. So it was a collaboration between King and the civil rights movement and L.B.J.''
 Even the Bush administration can take some credit for making Mr. Obama's campaign possible, Mr. Hulse said at the Caribbean breakfast, by making Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice the first black secretaries of state.
 But if Dr. King were alive today, Mr. Hulse added, he would be talking about how much the war in Iraq -- in which Mr. Powell and Ms. Rice had a significant role -- is ''taking away from the middle class,'' much as he spoke, at Riverside Church, of Vietnam's toll on the poor.
 Debra Lesane, a consultant who is helping the chamber plan seminars on banking and credit, said Dr. King would be deploring the subprime mortgage crisis, which has disproportionately affected minority homeowners. 
 Paraphrasing Dr. King, Mr. Bassford, the Moneytree executive, agreed. ''It's not good enough to have all the rights to engage in all the areas of commerce, if you don't have the ability,'' he said at the Nasdaq ceremony. ''What good is it to be able to sit at the lunch counter if you don't have the money to buy a hamburger?''
 Mr. Bassford has championed voluntary standards for ethics and transparency for the storefront check-cashing services that many low-income families rely on for short-term loans they cannot get from banks, Niger Innis said, explaining why the Congress of Racial Equality was honoring a purveyor of high-interest short-term loans. 
 Economic issues also were at the forefront for people who felt disconnected from the holiday.
 The Industrial Workers of the World has chosen the King holiday to protest against Starbucks for not providing holiday pay to its employees on that date. But some baristas said they had never heard of the campaign by the union, which is fighting to organize them. 
 ''It's just a day like any other, like all holidays,'' said Fernando Heredia, 22, who often works holidays at the Starbucks at Eighth Avenue and 43rd Street. He said he had not thought much about Dr. King since high school.
 Just outside the Nasdaq ceremony, Jordan Ramos, 19, on a cigarette break in Times Square, said that he would not get the holiday off from his media services job, and that Dr. King loomed larger for his Puerto Rican grandmother, who had lived through the civil rights struggle.
 But he said he had come to connect Dr. King's message to issues of more immediacy for him, like immigrants' rights. ''It's not just about African-Americans but about all minorities, how we're all treated,'' he said.
 Nearby, Idris, 35, an immigrant from Ghana who declined to give his last name, said he could not take the holiday off because he is paid on commission for selling tour bus packages to passers-by. He said that he felt excluded in the United States, and that Dr. King's message held little reassurance. 
 ''It's an American thing to me,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Help for Afghanistan

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Ambassador Ronald E. Neumann correctly characterizes the increasingly volatile conditions in Afghanistan by noting the presence of a ''growing Taliban resurgence'' (''Afghans, Report for Duty,'' Op-Ed, Jan. 14). Recent Senlis Council research indicates that a resurgent Taliban now has a permanent presence in 54 percent of the country. 
Although Ambassador Neumann cites the need for a stronger Afghan military to counter the growing Taliban insurgency, increased military efforts must also be coupled with effective administration of aid by ensuring that funds arrive where they are most needed.
 Currently, the Afghan population is facing widespread starvation and a growing refugee crisis. A failure to address these problems sends a message to Afghan civilians that Western forces are not there to help them. This only serves to drive them into the arms of the Taliban, who have used cunning propaganda to rapidly recruit many disillusioned civilians.
 The forced eradication of poppy crops has further worsened the situation by threatening the livelihoods of impoverished Afghan farmers. Senlis Council has proposed an alternative plan that was recently backed by the European Parliament.
 By allowing Afghan farmers to cultivate poppy for morphine, the economy of Afghanistan's rural communities could be diversified, which could win back the hearts and minds of the Afghan people.
 Eradication will and can never be successful because it destroys the one crop that serves as the main income to millions of Afghans. An Ipsos Reid survey commissioned by us in the United States revealed that the majority of the American public opposes it. Furthermore, 66 percent of those polled backed our Poppy for Medicine initiative.
 More pragmatic counternarcotics policies, along with effective aid administration, could significantly shorten the current conflict in Afghanistan. 
 Norine MacDonald Lashkar Gah, Afghanistan, Jan. 16, 2008 The writer is president and lead field researcher, the Senlis Council.

HEADLINE: World Markets Plunge on Fears of U.S. Slowdown

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER and HEATHER TIMMONS; Mark Landler reported from Frankfurt and Heather Timmons from New Delhi. Gardiner Harris contributed reporting from Washington and Keith Bradsher from Hong Kong.

 BODY:
Amid fears that the United States may be in a recession, the decline in stock markets accelerated Tuesday morning as exchanges opened across Asia.
 Markets in Tokyo, Hong Kong and Sydney all fell farther in the opening hours of trading Tuesday than they had all day on Monday. The Hong Kong market plunged another 8 percent by early afternoon after tumbling 5.49 percent on Monday. In Tokyo, the Nikkei dropped 5 percent, hitting a low not seen since September 2005 and facing its worst two-day drop in 17 years on concern global growth is faltering.
 The fears of a recession have roiled markets from Mumbai to Frankfurt on Monday, puncturing the hopes of many investors that Europe and Asia would be able to sidestep an American downturn. Until now, overseas markets had largely avoided the sell-off that has caused steep declines recently in the United States, whose markets were closed in observance of Martin Luther King's Birthday. But investors reacted with what many analysts described as panic to the multiplying signs of weakness in the American economy.
 And in a sign that the United States could join the sell-off on Tuesday, trading in stock index futures pointed to a substantial decline when markets reopen on Wall Street. 
 The angst about the United States belies the popular theory that Europe and Asia are not as dependent on the American economy as they once were, in part because they trade more with each other. The theory, known as decoupling, has been used to explain why economies like China and Germany have kept growing robustly, even as the United States has slowed.
 ''The market is not at all convinced about decoupling, and I think the market is probably right,'' said Thomas Mayer, the chief European economist at Deutsche Bank in London. ''When you look at it more closely, we're suffering from the same issues.''
 Monday's sell-off was evenly distributed from east to west. The DAX index of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange plummeted 7.2 percent, its steepest one-day decline since Sept. 11, 2001. The 7.4 percent drop in the Sensex index in Mumbai was the second-worst single-day tumble in its history.
 Stocks followed suit when markets opened in the Western Hemisphere. Canadian stocks were down nearly 5 percent, and a key market index in Brazil was off 6.6 percent.
 Shares of banks led the decline Monday in many countries, underscoring that the subprime mortgage crisis continues to hobble the global financial system. On Monday, a German state bank, WestLB, said it would report a loss of $1.44 billion in 2007 because of its exposure to deteriorating mortgage assets.
 ''There is indeed some panic,'' Mr. Mayer said. ''What we're seeing, in Europe and Asia, is that the markets are pricing in a recession.''
 Investors were scarcely comforted by President Bush's announcement on Friday of an economic stimulus package of as much as $145 billion. Mr. Bush's ''shot in the arm,'' economists said, did not persuade the rest of the world that the United States will escape a recession, or that it will either.
 In reference to the global stock sell-off, Jeanie Mamo, a spokeswoman for the White House, said: ''We don't comment on daily market moves. We're confident that the global economy will continue to grow and that the U.S. economy will return to stronger growth with the economic policies the president called for.''
 The turmoil will put even more pressure on the European Central Bank, which has charted a different course from the Federal Reserve by warning that it might raise interest rates to curb inflation, rather than cut them, as the Fed has, to ward off a recession. Mr. Mayer and others predict the bank will be forced into an about-face in coming months.
 While Asia has been less buffeted by the credit crisis than Europe, the Bank of China now appears vulnerable, with analysts predicting it will have to write-down the value of its American mortgage holdings.
 Investors in Asia have been in a state of denial about a possible recession in the United States, said Adrian Mowat, JPMorgan's chief strategist in Asia. But now, he said, many believe ''there's no debate about it.'' The only question, he added, is ''how long and deep'' a recession might be.
 In Japan, which may be facing a new recession of its own, most indexes were off Monday by more than 3 percent .
 In Europe, the housing market, after a long boom, is cooling, especially in Britain, Spain and Ireland. That will depress the growth rate in those countries, which are among the region's economic pace-setters.
 European banks continue to make unwelcome disclosures about write-downs of mortgage assets, even if the losses are not as dire as those reported by Citigroup or Merrill Lynch. Bank loans across Europe are being constrained, according to a recent survey by the European Central Bank.
 German banks, in particular, are haunted by the American subprime crisis. The troubles of WestLB came a week after a German property lender, Hypo Real Estate, lost a third of its market value after it disclosed higher-than-expected losses from the credit crisis. WestLB, after warning that its 2007 losses would be more than twice its earlier estimate, said its biggest shareholders, the state of North Rhine-Westphalia and regional savings bank, had agreed to inject up to 2 billion euros ($2.9 billion) of capital into the bank to stabilize it.
 Also on Monday, Commerzbank warned it would make additional write-downs in the fourth quarter of 2007. This caught analysts off guard.
 ''The amounts are not so significant,'' said Simon Adamson, an analyst at CreditSights, an independent research firm in London. ''It was more the way the market was caught by surprise.''
 Shares of Commerzbank fell 10 percent Monday, Deutsche Bank declined 6.7 percent, Societe Generale of France dropped 8 percent, BNP Paribas decreased 9.6 percent and the ING Group of the Netherlands fell 10.5 percent.
 But the damage extended to the shares of energy companies like BP and Royal Dutch Shell, which dropped on worries that a global economic slowdown would crimp the demand for oil and gas.
 ''The problem is more deeply rooted in anxiety about the global economy than it is in Germany,'' said Boris Boehm, an asset manager at Nordinvest in Hamburg. ''People are really afraid. But it's a good thing because fear, along with action, gets the market to its proper level quickly.''
 Those jitters extended to fast-growing markets, like China and India, that are thought to be relatively insulated from the United States. The Shanghai composite index, which had risen nearly 88 percent in the year through Friday, closed down 5.1 percent on Monday, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng fell 5.5 percent, also the most since Sept. 11, 2001. It had been up 24 percent in the year through Friday.
 While emerging markets may have been poised for a drop after their run-up, the rout on Monday may also signal a basic shift in sentiment, analysts said. Mr. Mowat of JPMorgan said that it did not matter whether markets were separated by geography or asset class because, he said, ''we trade together in corrections.''
 No matter how many bridges, roads, and power plants China builds, or how many new cars India sells, a downturn in the United States will ripple across the economies of Asia, experts said.
 ''If the United States consumer quits buying things, it is going to hurt in Asia,'' said Deborah Schuller, an Asia regional credit officer for Moody's Investors Service. She said most rated corporations there would be able to withstand a nine-month recession in America, but if it were to stretch to 12 months or more, there could be serious problems. 
 Worries about China are adding to Asia's uneasiness. Its private property market is in the midst of a shakeout, and scores of small developers have gone out of business. 
 In both Asia and Europe, there may be further shocks as banks tally the fallout from their investments in the American mortgage market. 
 ''There's an old saying in the market that banks lead us into recession and banks lead us out,'' Mr. Boehm of Nordinvest said.

HEADLINE: As Alps Warm, a Snow-Deprived Ski Resort Sells for $1

BYLINE: By UTA HARNISCHFEGER

DATELINE: ERNEN, Switzerland 

 BODY:
Bruno Prior, a British entrepreneur, saw the ad from the Ernen ski-lift company one day as he was sipping coffee and looking through the newspaper in London.
 Several months later -- after paying the token sum of one Swiss franc, or about 90 cents -- he is the proud owner of four ski lifts, two trail groomers and a restaurant on 12 miles of ski slopes.
 Effectively giving the ski operation away was an act of desperation on the part of Ernen, which, like hundreds of other small Alpine ski stations at medium altitudes, faces dire times. Most customers these days prefer the larger resorts with hundreds of miles of ski runs, apres-ski activities and luxury shopping. As global warming brings less snow, lower-altitude stations rely more on costly snow machines. 
 ''Mr. Prior is our lucky charm,'' said Heinz Seiler, who runs the Ernen ski-lift company, Sportbahnen Erner Galen, now owned by Mr. Prior. ''He spared our 560-soul village from a catastrophe.'' Mr. Seiler's tiny office looks out on the village square, with its 16th-century wooden houses. 
 ''Smaller ski stations like ours have it much harder,'' Mr. Seiler said. ''Tourism is the only proposition here. There is nothing else.''
 Last ski season, the ski-lift company lost more than $180,000. In March, the need for $1.4 million more to renew its operating license -- required every couple of decades -- was the last straw. With rising losses and temperatures, and the snowfall becoming less dependable, the village, the majority owner of the company, decided to shut down the lifts.
 ''We braced ourselves to lose two-thirds of our winter guests,'' Mr. Seiler said.
 Since the boom days of the early 1990s, the number of annual overnight stays in Ernen has decreased by almost half, to 90,000 last winter. 
 ''In an act of desperation,'' Mr. Seiler said, the company decided to give away the ski lifts to the person whose idea for resuscitating the resort would provide the most benefit for the village. 
 The telephone rang for weeks. The village chose Mr. Prior over competing investors from Asia, the United States and the Netherlands because residents liked his concept for restoring the ski business instead of just selling off the property for vacation homes that might not be used much. 
 After spending more than $450,000 on the current ski season and a feasibility study, Mr. Prior plans to invest as much as $45 million to build two new lifts and hotels, initially with 300 beds.
 Mr. Prior, whose family business had just sold off a subsidiary when he saw the ad, decided to invest in ''something fun.''
 ''As a private company we are free to invest into an unfashionable ski resort,'' he said in a telephone interview. ''We can afford to be patient.''
 He hopes that new hotels and modern lifts will draw skiers, and that new, higher-altitude runs will guarantee snow.
 Mr. Prior is not the first foreign investor to answer the call of the mountains. The most high-profile case is the Egyptian billionaire entrepreneur Samih Sawiris, who plans to convert a former Alpine military base, Andermatt, into a grand skiing destination by building an 18-hole golf course, 800 apartments, six luxury hotels and lavish leisure facilities.
 ''The important thing is getting warm beds,'' said Rolf Gruber, who runs a restaurant along the road to Ernen, meaning with people in them. More commonly, investors build chalets to sell as second homes. While they generate quick returns for builders, they often end up as cold beds, rarely used by their owners. 
 Less snow, fewer skiers and cold beds have meant less work for local residents. Most young people leave Ernen, and if past trends continue, it is only a matter of time until the primary school, with one classroom serving 13 children in first through fourth grades, shuts down.
 ''Mr. Prior will bring new life and work for those who want to live here, and maybe also new children,'' says Ruedi Schweizer, whose family is part of a commune that works a small farm, runs a small organic-food store and offers mule trekking for tourists. 
 As the village sought to save itself, he said, dozens of local groups proposed alternatives to skiing, like an artificial lake for ice-skating, none of which were ever put in place. Mr. Schweizer remains torn about the new hotels, which might change the village in ways he would not like. ''But we have no real alternatives,'' he said. ''The village is dead without its tourists.''
 Examples of Swiss ski resorts facing economic hardship abound. This year, three mountain villages in the southern canton, or state, of Ticino warded off bankruptcy proceedings after the canton offered interim financing. 
 Even more exclusive places are not immune. A last-minute bridge loan from its parent company allowed the Madrisa cable-car company in Klosters, a resort known for celebrity visitors like Prince Charles, to open for the winter. But now the company needs $2.7 million more for snow machines.
 In Visperterminen, a tiny three-lift ski station 15 miles down the valley from Ernen that was on the verge of shutting down, 14 retirees helped keep it open by working without pay to operate the ski lift. 
 Given this year's early and abundant snowfalls, there is widespread hope that Mr. Prior's first skiing season will encourage him to invest more. 
 Mr. Gruber, the chef, hopes to welcome English guests by next season. ''That gives me enough time to translate my menu into English,'' he said. ''But believe me, I will definitely not offer bread pudding.''

HEADLINE: For Ex-Trader, Sinking Feeling Is Reassuring

BYLINE: By LYNNLEY BROWNING

 BODY:
After four years of trading subprime mortgages, Jason Rew jettisoned his job at the investment bank Goldman Sachs and founded an off-shore business. 
 Mr. Rew started Great Burial Reef, which inters cremated remains in urns off the coast of Florida. 
 With the subprime crisis creating billion-dollar losses at investment banks, Mr. Rew's shift into death care, as it is known, might seem lifesaving, career-wise. As homebuyers with shaky credit histories default on their loans in record numbers, the losses to investors and lenders have led to layoffs on Wall Street and have sent stock markets plummeting, stoking fears of an economic recession. 
 Mr. Rew's unusual bet on a career in death care comes as Goldman Sachs looks as if might come out of the turmoil in better shape than its rivals in investment banking. 
 Mr. Rew left Goldman last February, before the credit market began to tighten in August and losses from subprime mortgage investments began to disrupt the stock markets. While he is loath to say he saw the problems coming -- ''at the time everybody thought things were still optimistic and unknown'' -- he said that he also felt the good times would not last. 
 ''We had had four years of unprecedented growth and prosperity, but it was going to be hard to continue that kind of upward climb,'' he said in an interview from Lakewood Ranch, Fla., near Sarasota, where Great Burial Reef is based.
 The company, which Mr. Rew started with half a million dollars, offers customers the chance to buy a maple urn made by artists in New Mexico to hold a person's cremated remains. The urns are placed into a specially made concrete ''reef'' in 35 feet of water two miles west of Sarasota, in the Gulf of Mexico. 
 Each reef, rendered waterproof with a sealant used on battleships, has two niches for two urns. 
 From a chartered boat, people with urns containing the remains of loved ones, including pets, can watch as scuba divers anchor the urns into place. The cost: $7,500 an urn, or $9,800 for two urns in one reef. 
 ''This provides a permanent, tasteful alternative for those who want to be buried in nature's cemetery,'' Mr. Rew said. 
 The first reef will be lowered into the water by a barge in March. Mr. Rew said that an urn containing the remains of his father, who died in 2006 in a car accident at the age of 49, would be the first placed in it. Over time, Mr. Rew has plans for more than 120 individual concrete reefs to be placed together in a starfish pattern.
 Mr. Rew, who comes across as soft-spoken and thoughtful, seems a far cry from the Masters of the Universe types that run Wall Street's trading desks. 
 ''My father passing away was the catalyst, and it made me start reflecting,'' he said. ''There's nothing more peaceful than being buried at sea.''

HEADLINE: California: Trade Mission To Cuba

BYLINE: By MARC LACEY

 BODY:
California, the nation's largest agricultural producer, is trying to increase its share of the hundreds of millions of dollars in food products that Cuba buys every year from the United States under a loophole in Washington's trade embargo against the island. A. G. Kawamura, California's secretary of food and agriculture, is leading a delegation of 18 business officials to Havana this week to promote products like nuts, citrus fruits and wine. California sold about $700,000 in products to Cuba in 2007, but the state predicted that the figure could be increased to $180 million. Pedro Alvarez Borrego, chairman of the Cuban government company that imports food products, said the biggest thing Cuba wanted from California was help in lifting what Havana calls an economic blockade.

HEADLINE: World Markets Plunge on Fears of U.S. Slowdown

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER and HEATHER TIMMONS; Mark Landler reported from Frankfurt and Heather Timmons from New Delhi. Keith Bradsher contributed reporting from Hong Kong and Gardiner Harris from Washington.

DATELINE: FRANKFURT 

 BODY:
Fears that the United States may be in a recession reverberated around the world on Monday, sending stock markets from Mumbai to Frankfurt into a tailspin and puncturing the hopes of many investors that Europe and Asia would be able to sidestep an American downturn.
 Until now, overseas markets had largely avoided the sell-off that has caused steep declines recently in the United States, whose markets were closed in observance of Martin Luther King's Birthday. But investors reacted with what many analysts described as panic to the multiplying signs of weakness in the American economy.
 And in a sign that the United States could join the sell-off on Tuesday, trading in stock index futures pointed to a substantial decline when markets reopen on Wall Street. 
 The angst about the United States belies the popular theory that Europe and Asia are not as dependent on the American economy as they once were, in part because they trade more with each other. The theory, known as decoupling, has been used to explain why economies like China and Germany have kept growing robustly, even as the United States has slowed. 
 ''The market is not at all convinced about decoupling, and I think the market is probably right,'' said Thomas Mayer, the chief European economist at Deutsche Bank in London. ''When you look at it more closely, we're suffering from the same issues.''
 As exchanges opened on Tuesday in Asia, the decline only seemed to accelerate. Markets in Tokyo, Hong Kong, Sydney and Seoul, South Korea, all fell farther in the opening hours of trading than they had all day on Monday. The Hong Kong market plunged another 7.22 percent by late morning after tumbling 5.49 percent on Monday. In Tokyo, the Nikkei hit a low not seen since September 2005.
 Monday's sell-off was evenly distributed from east to west. The DAX index of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange plummeted 7.2 percent, its steepest one-day decline since Sept. 11, 2001. The 7.4 percent drop in the Sensex index in Mumbai was the second-worst single-day tumble in its history.
 Stocks followed suit when markets opened in the Western Hemisphere. Canadian stocks were down nearly 5 percent, and a key market index in Brazil was off 6.6 percent.
 Shares of banks led the decline on Monday in many countries, underscoring that the subprime mortgage crisis continues to hobble the global financial system. On Monday, a German state bank, WestLB, said it would report a loss of $1.44 billion in 2007 because of its exposure to deteriorating mortgage assets.
 ''There is indeed some panic,'' Mr. Mayer said. ''What we're seeing, in Europe and Asia, is that the markets are pricing in a recession.''
 Investors were scarcely comforted by President Bush's announcement on Friday of an economic stimulus package of as much as $145 billion. Mr. Bush's ''shot in the arm,'' economists said, did not persuade the rest of the world that the United States will escape a recession, or that it will either.
 In reference to the global stock sell-off, Jeanie Mamo, a spokeswoman for the White House, said: ''We don't comment on daily market moves. We're confident that the global economy will continue to grow and that the U.S. economy will return to stronger growth with the economic policies the president called for.''
 The turmoil will put even more pressure on the European Central Bank, which has charted a different course from the Federal Reserve by warning that it might raise interest rates to curb inflation, rather than cut them, as the Fed has, to ward off a recession. Mr. Mayer and others predict the bank will be forced into an about-face in coming months.
 While Asia has been less buffeted by the credit crisis than Europe, the Bank of China now appears vulnerable, with analysts predicting it will have to write-down the value of its American mortgage holdings.
 Investors in Asia have been in a state of denial about a possible recession in the United States, said Adrian Mowat, JPMorgan's chief strategist in Asia. But now, he said, many believe ''there's no debate about it.'' The only question, he added, is ''how long and deep'' a recession might be.
 In Japan, which may be facing a new recession of its own, most indexes were off Monday by more than 3 percent .
 In Europe, the housing market is cooling after a long boom, especially in Britain, Spain and Ireland. That will depress the growth rate in those countries, which are among the region's economic pace-setters.
 European banks continue to make unwelcome disclosures about write-downs of mortgage assets, even if the losses are not as dire as those reported by Citigroup or Merrill Lynch. Bank loans across Europe are being constrained, according to a recent survey by the European Central Bank.
 German banks, in particular, are haunted by the American subprime crisis. The troubles of WestLB came a week after a German property lender, Hypo Real Estate, lost a third of its market value after it disclosed higher-than-expected losses from the credit crisis. WestLB, after warning that its 2007 losses would be more than twice its earlier estimate, said its biggest shareholders, the state of North Rhine-Westphalia and regional savings bank, had agreed to inject up to 2 billion euros ($2.9 billion) of capital into the bank to stabilize it.
 Also on Monday, Commerzbank warned it would make additional write-downs in the fourth quarter of 2007. This caught analysts off guard.
 ''The amounts are not so significant,'' said Simon Adamson, an analyst at CreditSights, an independent research firm in London. ''It was more the way the market was caught by surprise.''
 Shares of Commerzbank fell 10 percent Monday, Deutsche Bank declined 6.7 percent, Societe Generale of France dropped 8 percent, BNP Paribas decreased 9.6 percent and the ING Group of the Netherlands fell 10.5 percent.
 But the damage extended to the shares of energy companies like BP and Royal Dutch Shell, which dropped on worries that a global economic slowdown would crimp the demand for oil and gas.
 ''The problem is more deeply rooted in anxiety about the global economy than it is in Germany,'' said Boris Boehm, an asset manager at Nordinvest in Hamburg. ''People are really afraid. But it's a good thing because fear, along with action, gets the market to its proper level quickly.''
 Those jitters extended to fast-growing markets, like China and India, that are thought to be relatively insulated from the United States. The Shanghai composite index, which had risen nearly 88 percent in the year through Friday, closed down 5.1 percent on Monday, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng fell 5.5 percent, also the most since Sept. 11, 2001. It had been up 24 percent in the year through Friday.
 While emerging markets may have been poised for a drop after their run-up, the rout on Monday may also signal a basic shift in sentiment, analysts said. Mr. Mowat of JPMorgan said that it did not matter whether markets were separated by geography or asset class because, he said, ''we trade together in corrections.''
 No matter how many bridges, roads, and power plants China builds, or how many new cars India sells, a downturn in the United States will ripple across the economies of Asia, experts said.
 ''If the United States consumer quits buying things, it is going to hurt in Asia,'' said Deborah Schuller, an Asia regional credit officer for Moody's Investors Service. She said most rated corporations there would be able to withstand a nine-month recession in America, but if it were to stretch to 12 months or more, there could be serious problems. 
 Worries about China are adding to Asia's uneasiness. Its private property market is in the midst of a shakeout, and scores of small developers have gone out of business. 
 In both Asia and Europe, there may be further shocks as banks tally the fallout from their investments in the American mortgage market. 
 ''There's an old saying in the market that banks lead us into recession and banks lead us out,'' Mr. Boehm of Nordinvest said.

HEADLINE: Investors Abroad No Longer Feel Immune From the U.S. Economy

BYLINE: By CARTER DOUGHERTY

 BODY:
FRANKFURT -- Since late summer, the United States economy has demonstrated an enduring power to surprise. And not for the better.
 Investors worldwide are pondering the prospects for a recession in the United States, their latest and furthest-reaching preoccupation resulting from a succession of bad news that the American economy, the world's largest, has delivered since the onset of global financial turmoil.
 When credit markets seized up, the product of mounting losses linked to the American mortgage market, stocks dived, then recovered, as investors factored higher borrowing costs into the outlook for corporate earnings. The changes, some reasoned, were an imaginable step away from the easy money of recent years. 
 But as large banks in the United States disclosed losses in November, equity markets plunged again to account for a lending system that, it turned out, needed to purge losses and be recapitalized. Stocks recovered somewhat in December.
 Now the focus among overseas investors has jumped to recession, and a conviction that the United States cannot avoid it has became embedded in many market watchers' and investors' psychology.
 ''We have moved from a phase where an assessment was made on the credit situation, which is improving, onto the macroeconomic news flow,'' said Jacques Cailloux, chief euro-area economist at the Royal Bank of Scotland in London. ''And if you look at the United States, the data has not been very encouraging.''
 On Monday, investors ignored the assurances last week from the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, that the United States might avoid recession. Instead, they have begun to ask how bad it could become in the United States. And how bad that would make it for the rest of the world.
 ''Ten days ago, only a very few people thought this would be a bad one,'' said Erik Nielsen, chief European economist at Goldman Sachs in London. ''But now you have people debating just that.''
 The latest panicky discussion -- which ushered Asian and European markets Monday to some of their steepest losses since September 2001 -- revolves around whether the normally resilient American economy will suffer a sharp, protracted downturn or a brief, shallow slowing if consumers regain their footing after the long period of free spending by borrowing against the value of their homes.
 Emergency proposals with broad support from the Republican White House and many Congressional Democrats to stimulate the economy, coupled with further signs that the Fed will again cut borrowing costs to cushion the blow, suggest agreement in the United States that the economic downturn is a serious threat and must be addressed immediately.
 That sense of urgency is also fueling further debate among policy makers in Europe and Asia about whether their economies are truly as insulated from American woes as many would like to believe. Investors in Asia, conditioned by the roaring economies of emerging markets like China and India, had resisted factoring the chances of a recession in the United States into equity prices, stock strategists said, a stance that helped ward off losses in recent months. But now that expectation of a recession is wider, the adjustment in the markets has been jarring -- a point evident in Monday's losses.
 For more than a year, the European economy also looked as if it had finally come to stand on its own, having grown increasingly resilient as companies were redesigned to hedge against currency swings, and consumers took part in a virtuous cycle of job creation and spending.
 Even after the first signs of turmoil were evident in the credit markets, economic officials, including those at the European Central Bank, could point to evidence that Europe had grown resilient enough to withstand ripples from a slowdown in the United States. But with near-daily market gyrations stemming from fears about the American economy, even some of the greatest optimists are growing leery.
 The signals from the United States have been strong enough that the financial markets are betting that Europe will take a much bigger hit than previously expected.
 This conviction is strong enough that investors are behaving, based on signals from the bond market, as if they expect the European Central Bank to ease interest rates later this year -- even though the bank has given no such signal.
 ''Over all, the market is sending a message to the E.C.B. that the outlook is very different from what the bank has said,'' Mr. Cailloux said. ''The markets are pre-empting the E.C.B.''
 Instead, the European bank has threatened to raise interest rates -- rather than lower them, as is happening in the United States -- if labor unions demand compensation for food and energy price increases in new wage settlements, a move that could be expected to increase inflation, already 3 percent in the euro zone.
 Yet even the president of the European bank, Jean-Claude Trichet -- who maintains that the euro area can continue to grow solidly despite deteriorating conditions in the United States -- acknowledged recently that the slowing in the United States must be watched carefully.
 In trying to estimate how much American consumers might curb their spending, slowing the economy further, some analysts are beginning to make comparisons to Japan's long stagnation of the 1990s.
 This view holds that consumers have overdone things to such a degree on cheap credit and loans from ever more expensive homes, that the adjustment could drag out more than a few quarters. At the least, this thinking goes, corporate earnings could be tame even after the economy stops contracting, slowing any recovery.

HEADLINE: To Some, the Widening Crisis Seems Driven by Fear, Not Facts

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS Jr.

 BODY:
The fear is spreading.
 For months now, investors have been lured to overseas markets with the promise that surging growth and solid economic fundamentals in Asia and the Middle East would insulate them from the credit squeeze plaguing the United States market. 
 But the broad international sell-off on Monday -- and the prospect of a steep market decline in the United States on Tuesday -- raised fresh concerns that a looming recession and the fallout from subprime mortgages could have global repercussions. 
 Some analysts saw the sell-off, with leading indexes off 4 percent to 7 percent worldwide, as being driven by fear more than by fact.
 ''I don't think it's warranted by the fundamentals,'' said Edward Yardeni, an independent strategist. ''The resilience of the global economy in the face of a credit crunch has been impressive.''
 Mr. Yardeni warned, however, that in a time of panic and fear, less attention is paid to fundamentals, like a fairly tight United States job market and strong growth and the extraordinary buildup of foreign exchange reserves in emerging markets. The result is panic selling and the prospect of a global recession. ''People are creating the financial violence that they hoped to avoid,'' he said.
 More could be in store on Tuesday. Markets in the United States were closed on Monday in observance of Martin Luther King's Birthday, but futures for the Dow Jones industrial average traded 500 points down in a stark indicator that the main indexes could face a sharp drop, adding to one of the worst-ever starts to a year.
 Other analysts point out that the overseas uncertainty reflects the unpleasant if not devastating reality that the excesses of the long-running credit boom will not go away soon. 
 What makes this correction more dangerous, they say, is that the selling is not being driven by panicky retail investors, as it was in the collapse of the technology bubble, but by hedge funds and investment banks that find themselves saddled with illiquid securities backed by an array of valueless assets.
 ''What you see is not a panic of the public. This is a panic of the sophisticated,'' said James Sinclair, a well-known gold trader who oversees a financial Web site and who has warned investors for years about the dangers of derivatives. ''But this will have a tremendous impact on the public. In the end, this will hit Joe Sixpack. It's very serious, and drastic emergency economic action is needed.''
 Indeed, according to research on liquidity flows by Thomas McManus, an equity strategist at Bank of America, net inflows to domestic stock-oriented mutual funds through the first nine days of the year were positive, albeit off from higher levels in previous years.
 Most retail investors have not invested directly in the complex securities that have ruined the reputations of some of Wall Street's best-respected minds. But their exposure to plummeting companies like Citigroup and Merrill Lynch, and now a broader basket of stocks affected by the market malaise, will add to the sense of wealth erosion that many are already feeling from the declining values of their houses.
 On his blog, JSMineSet, Mr. Sinclair has told his readers that as much as $450 trillion worth of derivatives could disintegrate, leading to a far greater, and in some ways unpredictable, calamity. He argues that compared with the savings and loan crisis in the late 1980s, when the formation of a trust company for beaten-down institutions established a floor for sinking assets, the inability of the government to form a similar entity for suffering securities has heightened investors' unease.
 While the views of Mr. Sinclair, a gold bug who expects the price of gold to go to $1,650, up from about $870 now, might be taken with a grain of salt, other experts have also begun to warn of the dire consequences of the credit market collapse.
 Christopher Wood, a strategist based in Asia who publishes a widely read newsletter called Greed & Fear, pointed out in a note published this weekend that the potential insolvency of bond insurers like Ambac, MBIA and ACA Capital speaks to a larger market correction that has not yet been grasped by policy makers. ''Greed & Fear's view is that with the bond insurance business model fast unwinding, a full-scale crisis could be coming,'' he wrote.
 The international selling has also stoked a long-held fear that flush Asian and Middle Eastern central banks and government-backed investment funds will cut back on their dollar-based investments -- like Treasury bills and stakes in troubled investment banks -- in the face of another round of interest rate cuts and continued weakness in the dollar.
 These flows have represented a crucial font of liquidity for an economy that produces little of its own domestic savings, and they have been lifelines for capital-starved banks. But no money manager, regardless of the time frame, likes to invest in a falling market, and analysts fear that a spate of additional write-downs and market turmoil will signal to foreigners that the markets here have not yet found their bottom.
 One large investor, who asked not to be identified because he did not want to tip his hand, said that the sell-off on Monday was a direct response to the stimulus package proposed by the Bush administration -- not so much a judgment that the proposal was inadequate as a reflection of the weakness and drift of the world's largest economy.
 ''It is one thing to see the market go from 14,000 to 12,000,'' he said. ''But when the president of the United States says we are sick, you can't ignore that.''

 BODY:
FARE INCREASES ON AGAIN Major airlines have raised fares again, a week after a round of $50 round-trip fare increases collapsed when Continental Airlines rescinded its increases, causing all the others to back off as well. But on Thursday, American Airlines instituted a new increase of $40 round trip, citing fuel costs. Delta matched, and the others fell in line over the weekend, according to Tom Parsons, chief executive officer of Bestfares.com. Mr. Parsons said that business travelers booking flights at the last minute have been hard hit by incremental fare increases in recent years. ''Since January 2005, business travelers who purchase tickets with little or no advance purchase have taken the brunt of increases in airfares,'' he said. 
 NEW AIRPORTS FOR CLEAR Two major airports, Washington Dulles and Reagan National, selected Clear to operate its Registered Traveler program. ''All airlines operating from the airports, and their passengers, will be able to use Clear's fast-pass lanes within weeks,'' said the company, Verified Identity Pass, that runs the program. Steven Brill, the company's founder, said that Clear had already signed up 2,000 Washington area residents for Clear, which has about 90,000 members in all, and operates at about a dozen airports. The program provides expedited movement through airport security checkpoints to members who pay $100 a year for biometrically encoded identification cards. Two small competitors operate versions of the program at airports in Reno and Jacksonville, Fla. 
 TRANS-ATLANTIC TRAFFIC Trans-Atlantic air travel continued to be strong in December, with the leading carriers on the routes reporting an average traffic increase of 8.9 percent over December 2006, said Donald N. Martin & Company, a travel data company. Average capacity -- the number of available seats -- was up 9.1 percent ''with Delta, Continental and Northwest leading the way,'' the company said. The December numbers support estimates that travel from the United States to Europe in 2007 ''finally exceeded the year 2000 record of 13.12 million visitors,'' the company reported.
 ET CETERA Accor North America, one of the nation's largest owner/operators of economy lodging, says it opened of 37 Motel 6 and Studio 6 locations in 2007. That is in line with company plans to double the number of properties for its economy brands. ... Warren Buffett's private jet company, NetJets Europe, apparently figures that the credit crunch is not having an impact on its high-spending customers. It is spending $715 million to add 39 luxury aircraft to its fleet. JOE SHARKEY

IRRELIGION 
 A Mathematician Explains Why the Arguments for God Just Don't Add Up 
 By John Allen Paulos 
 158 pages. Hill & Wang. $20. 
 Sam Harris's 2004 book, ''The End of Faith: Religion, Terror and the Future of Reason,'' set off a noisy boomlet of antireligion books, including Richard Dawkins's provocative if preachy tome, ''The God Delusion'' (2006), and Christopher Hitchens's furious (and often very funny) jeremiad, ''God Is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything'' (2007). These books provided a vehement response to the growing influence of evangelicals in American politics and the raging fires of fundamentalism around the world, and they even led to talk about the stirrings of a ''new atheist'' movement.
 At their best, these books performed the valuable service of reminding readers how far some politicians have departed from the Enlightenment values of the founders and the principle of separation of church and state -- particularly at a time when Mike Huckabee, a leading contender in the Republican presidential race, has called for the Constitution to be amended so that it can be brought in line with ''God's standards.'' 
 At their worst, these books simply spewed invective against religion, helping to ratify believers' accusations that atheists and agnostics lack respect for others' convictions (something believers are frequently guilty of themselves).
 The latest entry in the God wars is ''Irreligion'' by John Allen Paulos, the mathematician best known for his best-selling book ''Innumeracy.'' In this hasty and very lumpy volume Mr. Paulos proposes to expose the irrational basis of religious thinking, much the way he exposed rampant mathematical illiteracy in ''Innumeracy,'' this time providing some brisk refutations of the greatest-hits arguments for God, from ''the golden oldies of religious thought to those with a more contemporary beat.''
 The volume gets off to a bracing start, deftly dismantling creationist arguments that the astonishing complexity of life could have come about only through the efforts of a master designer, by succinctly showing how Darwin's theory of natural selection and free-market economics provide well-confirmed alternative explanations for the evolution of complex systems. 
 Writing in clear, direct prose, Mr. Paulos shows how even everyday references to purpose and intention can be easily reformulated in scientific, nonpurposive terms. For instance, ''The thermostat is trying to keep the house at a steady temperature'' can be rephrased in terms of metals' different rates of expansion: ''When it gets hot, this metal expands faster than the other one and tips a switch turning the furnace off, and when it gets cool, the metal contracts faster, turning the furnace back on. No one is really attributing intentionality to the metals.''
 In his opening chapters Mr. Paulos uses simple logic to point up the gaping holes in the so-called first-cause argument. ''Either everything has a cause, or there's something that doesn't,'' he writes. ''The first-cause argument collapses into this hole whichever tack we take. If everything has a cause, then God does, too, and there is no first cause. And if something doesn't have a cause, it may as well be the physical world.'' 
 What's more, he notes, ''the uncaused first cause needn't have any traditional God-like qualities. It's simply first, and as we know from other realms, being first doesn't mean being best. No one brags about still using the first personal computers to come on the market. Even if the first cause existed, it might simply be a brute fact -- or even worse, an actual brute.''
 As the book progresses, however, Mr. Paulos's writing becomes increasingly technical and increasingly jokey, and his reasoning becomes more and more difficult for the nonmathematician to follow. His repudiation of the ontological argument for the existence of God, for instance, is based on a reductive, paper-tiger summation of the argument itself: God is ''the greatest and most perfect possible being;'' this ''most perfect being must possess all characteristics of perfection''; and ''since it's better to exist than not to exist, existence is a characteristic of perfection.'' Hence, ''God exists by definition.''
 Similarly, Mr. Paulos's argument that ''doubt that God exists is almost banal in comparison to the more radical doubt'' that people ''exist, at least as anything more than nominal, marginally integrated entities having convenient labels like Myrtle and Oscar'' is hardly persuasive. After all, how many readers who aren't college students having stoned, late-night conversations want to debate whether or not they exist themselves? 
 As for Mr. Paulos's discussion of the contradictions involved in a deity being both omnipotent and benevolent, it consists of little more than regurgitation of the Epicurus aphorism to the effect that if God is willing to prevent evil but unable to, then he is not omnipotent; that if he is able to but unwilling, then he is malevolent; and that if he is both able and willing to prevent evil, then there is no explanation for evil's continued existence.
 Although Mr. Paulos begins ''Irreligion'' by promising that he will not use any hard-to-follow scientific formulas to make his case, he soon leads the reader deep into the mathematical wilderness by talking about things like the ''Boolean satisfiability problem'' and ''combinatorial identities'' and posing annoying paradoxes that do little but remind the reader of the ordeal of taking SATs. (''What is the smallest number of guests who need be present so that it will be certain that at least three of them will know each other or at least three of them will be strangers to each other?'') 
 In the course of this volume Mr. Paulos does provide some interesting asides about the so-called ''confirmation bias, a psychological tendency to seek confirmation rather than disconfirmation of any hypothesis we've adopted, however tentatively'' (which would seem to have applications to the Bush administration's use of intelligence in the prelude to the Iraq war). And he also does an entertaining job of applying probability theory to people's talk about miracles and amazing coincidences, which they've taken as evidence of the existence of God.
 Still, there is something perfunctory and hurried about all of Mr. Paulos's arguments, which will be shrugged off by anyone who has made the leap of faith into belief, and which will seem obvious to anyone who is already a proud heathen. Indeed, the reader finishes this volume with the suspicion that it was a rushed and cursory project, turned out quickly in an effort to catch the coattails of Messrs. Hitchens, Dawkins and Harris.

HEADLINE: Charity Begins in Washington

 BODY:
The munificence of American corporate titans warms the heart, sort of. The Chronicle of Philanthropy reports that the top 50 donors gave $7.3 billion to charity last year -- about $150 million per head. Excluding Warren Buffett's $43.5 billion burst of generosity in 2006, last year's giving easily beat the record set the year before. 
 This is great news for many worthy causes. Last year's top donor, William Barron Hilton of hotel fame, pledged $1.2 billion to his father's foundation, which supports efforts to prevent blindness worldwide, curb drug abuse among the young and help the homeless, among other things. Other donors targeted cancer research and children's health clinics.
 Yet we'd be so much happier about all the good things America's moneyed elite pay for if the government made needed public investments. 
 The flip side of American private largess is the stinginess of the public sector. Philanthropic contributions in the United States -- about $300 billion in 2006 -- probably exceed those of any other country. By contrast, America's tax take is nearly the lowest in the industrial world. Federal, state and local tax collections amount to just more than 25.5 percent of the nation's economic output. The Finnish government collects 48.8 percent. As a result, the United States spends less on social programs than virtually every other rich industrial country, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The Finnish government probably has money to build children's health clinics. 
 Critics of government spending argue that America's private sector does a better job making socially necessary investments. But it doesn't. Public spending is allocated democratically among competing demands. Rich benefactors can spend on anything they want, and they tend to spend on projects close to their hearts. 
 A study last year of 8,000 gifts of $1 million or more to 4,000 nonprofits found that 44 percent went to higher education, 16 percent to medical institutions and 12 percent to arts and cultural organizations. Only 5 percent were dedicated to social service groups. Nonprofit groups that rely on the largess of the wealthy are doing fine. The Cincinnati Ballet met its 2007 target of $1.1 million in just five months, the Chronicle said. Giving is down at Lighthouse Ministries, which serves the needy in Florida. 
 Philanthropic contributions are usually tax-free. They directly reduce the government's ability to engage in public spending. Perhaps the government should demand a role in charities' allocation of resources in exchange for the tax deduction. Or maybe the deduction should go altogether. Experts estimate that tax breaks motivate 25 percent to 30 percent of contributions.
 In any event, social needs, like those health clinics, are not about charity. They are a necessity. America needs a government that can and will pay for them.

HEADLINE: For Evacuated Building's Tenants, an Uncertain Future

BYLINE: By DARYL KHAN

 BODY:
To artists, photographers and writers, it is known as the ''kibbutz'' -- a pock-marked pasta factory converted into a commune of creative types. 
 It sits at the river's edge in Brooklyn, between warehouses, idle factories and riverside industries in Williamsburg, a neighborhood emblematic of the economic success of gentrification as well as its character-flattening dark side. But on Monday, it was the site of a government-ordered evacuation. 
 ''It's weird seeing your home turned into a disaster area,'' said Max Dickstein, a writer and editor for amNew York, who has lived in the building for a year and a half. He stood next to the entrance, where a sign taped to the doors read, ''American Red Cross Disaster Relief.'' 
 The day before, the Fire Department designated the building, at 475 Kent Avenue, a fire hazard after its owner, Nachman Brach, was said to have had flammable materials in a makeshift matzo bakery in the basement. That led to the evacuation, and to concerns by tenants as to whether they would be able to return soon -- or ever -- because of questions about the long-term use of the building for apartments.
 Tenants, some of whom had lived at 475 Kent for nearly a decade, scrambled to haul whatever belongings they could out of their lofts from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Monday, before the doors were shut. The residents get another chance to move items during the same period Tuesday. After that, they will be allowed to return on a case-by-case basis.
 They bottlenecked the one freight elevator in the building trying to meet what many described as an impossible deadline. Inside, signs were haphazardly taped to tenants' doors. One read, ''We have left. Thanks.'' A sad face had been drawn beneath the sign. Another read, ''Do Not Break Open the Door Please.''
 More than 200 tenants live and work in the building, which tenants described as a small town stacked 11 stories high, despite its being zoned exclusively for commercial use. A massive abstract painting hung on a 10th-floor wall. The fourth-floor hallway looked like a photo gallery. 
 Late in the afternoon, one tenant, Lai Ling Jew, 41, held an impromptu meeting.
 ''We're trying to figure out how to organize ourselves as tenants to get to the bottom of what's going on here,'' she said. ''We love our homes. This is a vibrant community we created. People look to New York as the most creative city, and the city is pushing us to the edges.''
 The meeting lasted past 4 p.m., in defiance of the deadline for the doors to be closed. Signs of confusion and sadness punctuated the frigid day. One tenant, Betsy Kelleher, said she had fought for years to get the lofts legally converted into apartments. She said it was suspicious that the evacuation came weeks before a court decision that could have made the building rent-controlled.
 ''They want to clean everyone out and then convert them into expensive condos,'' she said.
 Calls to Mr. Brach's management office, Sheila Properties, went unanswered on Monday. Reached on his cellphone, Mr. Brach hung up. 
 Rob Swainston, who operates S11 Press from his 10th-floor studio, was one of a number of tenants whose livelihood was put in jeopardy. ''I found out yesterday that (a) I was unemployed, and (b) homeless,'' he said. ''Bang. Just like that. Thank you.''
 Mr. Dickstein left with good memories and apprehension about the future.
 ''This is a fantastic place,'' he said. ''It's hurtful to see it described as a flammable matzo factory instead of a community.''

HEADLINE: A Basic Hospital To-Do List Saves Lives

BYLINE: By JANE E. BRODY

 BODY:
This is a call to arms for everyone who may someday be hospitalized, or who has a relative who may someday be hospitalized -- which is to say everyone.
 These days, to spend time in the hospital is to be at risk of contracting a hospital-acquired infection. Some of these infections can be life-threatening. But there is a simple way to make that hospital stay safer, devised by Dr. Peter J. Pronovost, a physician-researcher at Johns Hopkins. 
 The method -- a five-item checklist to assure that proper precautions are taken to prevent infection -- has been thoroughly tested, first at Johns Hopkins and later in 108 intensive-care units in Michigan, where it succeeded beyond anyone's wildest dreams in saving lives and reducing costs for patients who received the major fluid tube called a central venous catheter. 
 According to Dr. Pronovost, whose findings in Michigan were published in The New England Journal of Medicine on Dec. 28, 2006, about half of intensive-care patients receive these catheters; about 80,000 a year become infected and 28,000 die, with an economic cost of $2.3 billion. 
 Five Simple Steps
 Using the checklist, in 18 months the average I.C.U. at these diverse hospitals reduced its catheter-related infection rate to zero, from 4 percent. All told, the checklist saved more than 1,500 lives and nearly $200 million. The program itself cost only $500,000.
 Dr. Pronovost, a professor of anesthesiology and critical care medicine, said in an interview that he distilled the five steps from a 64-page federal document on controlling hospital-acquired infections. When inserting a central venous catheter, doctors should do the following:
 1. Wash their hands with soap.
 2. Clean the patient's skin with chlorhexidine antiseptic.
 3. Put sterile drapes over the entire patient.
 4. Wear a sterile mask, hat, gown and gloves.
 5. Put a sterile dressing over the catheter site.
 To someone on the outside, this list may seem like a no-brainer. But in the crush of crisis medicine, one or more of these steps is often neglected, sometimes with disastrous results. What made the program work in Michigan was continuous -- and anonymous -- collection of data. The hospitals were monitored on their use of the list, their rates of infection and their feedback to medical personnel to show what was working and where gaps remained in quality care. 
 The task now is to expand the checklist concept to other procedures and to get hospitals throughout the country to adopt it. New Jersey and Rhode Island are already planning to use it. And following a report on the checklist in the Dec. 10, 2007, issue of The New Yorker by Dr. Atul Gawande, a surgeon at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, Dr. Pronovost said he had been approached by health care authorities in California, Washington and Tennessee seeking the program for their states. Spain is adopting the program nationwide, and the World Health Organization is hoping to take it global. 
 As Dr. Pronovost explained, medical research must go beyond understanding the biology of disease and devising effective therapies. 
 ''We have to assure that we deliver those therapies safely and effectively, but research examining 300 quality measures showed that patients receive adequate therapy only about half the time,'' he said.
 ''My approach was to figure out what it takes to change behavior,'' Dr. Pronovost said. ''This represents the biggest opportunity to improve health -- making sure that what we know works is delivered safely, effectively and efficiently.''
 Coincidentally, a report in the Jan. 15 issue of Clinical Infectious Diseases by Dr. Sanjay Saint and colleagues at the Veterans Affairs Ann Arbor Healthcare System and the University of Michigan stated that 1 percent of hospital patients fitted with a urinary catheter developed a urinary tract infection. Forty percent of all hospital-acquired infections are urinary. 
 Dr. Saint's national study ''found no strategy that appeared to be widely used to prevent hospital-acquired urinary tract infections.'' Nearly half of hospitals had no system telling them which patients had a catheter, and three-fourths had no system to show how long the catheter was in place or whether it had been removed. Furthermore, fewer than 10 percent of hospitals used any system to remind doctors to check daily on whether a patient's catheter was necessary; the longer one is in, the greater the likelihood of infection.
 A nationally imposed checklist for safe urinary catheter insertion and removal could sharply reduce the risk to patients and the costs of hospital care.
 But checklists need not be limited to reducing the risk of hospital-acquired infections. As Dr. Gawande and Dr. Pronovost explained, they could be used to enhance the safety of surgery and anesthesia, the treatment of patients with heart disease, diabetes, pulmonary diseases like asthma and a host of other conditions where certain approaches to care have been scientifically established as most effective but are still often neglected. 
 What You Can Do
 The federal Office for Human Research Protections recently ruled that because this quality-control program constituted research on human subjects, every participating hospital must first get approval from its institutional review board. That ruling did not halt the use of checklists in the Michigan hospitals where they had become part of routine care. But it did stop the collection of data based on the lists, which Dr. Gawande described as ''the driving force behind the effectiveness of the program,'' until each hospital's institutional review board approved it. 
 These boards meet monthly, bimonthly or quarterly. Sam Watson, executive director of the Michigan Hospital Association's Keystone Center for Patient Safety and Quality, a sponsor of the Michigan checklist program, said the need for their approval could seriously delay the use of checklists for other aspects of medical care, like preventing hospital-acquired urinary infections -- something his center has been working on with Dr. Saint.
 Dr. Gawande suggested that consumers write to their members of Congress and the Department of Health and Human Services, asking that the ruling be reversed. Dr. Pronovost suggested that consumers let Congress know that checklist programs ''could have a profound impact on their health,'' ask local hospitals whether they are using checklists to reduce infections, and write to state hospital associations asking for a statewide effort to reduce infections. 
 In addition, Dr. Pronovost said, hospital patients should be their own advocates, armed with their own checklist and asking medical personnel whether they are using it ''to help assure that I don't get an infection'' or asking, ''Do I still need this catheter?''

 ELKES--Terrence. President Gregory H. Williams and the faculty, staff and students of The City College of New York wish to express their deep sadness at the sudden passing of Terrence Elkes, one of CCNY's most eminent and dedicated alumni. He received his bachelor's degree in Economics and Political Science from The City College of New York in 1955 and earned his Doctor of Laws degree from the University of Michigan in 1958. He went on to a distinguished career in law and business, but always kept a warm place in his heart for his alma mater. A leading member of the City College 21st Century Foundation Board, Terry also served on its Investment Committee. In addition, the commitment Terry and his dearly loved wife Ruth made to the College earned them honored places in its President's Circle. Through his visionary support of science, he has helped to advance the scientific leadership of the College. This past fall, he was elected to membership in the Townsend Harris Society, receiving the highest award the CCNY Alumni Association can bestow. Terry's own eloquent words tell it best: ''For me, what City College really represented was the only opportunity where someone with my background could obtain a first class education. It was a system that was based strictly on merit and tuition-free, and it was the gateway towards a career which I would not have been able to achieve. Today's students deserve nothing less than that opportunity as well''. Our heartfelt condolences to Steven, David, and Daniel, their wives and children on the loss of Terry, so soon after losing their beloved mother Ruth. They were a very important part of the CCNY family. We will miss them both very much. 
 ELKES --Terrence. The University of Michigan, and President Mary Sue Coleman, express their deepest sympathy to the family of Terry Elkes. As a graduate of Michigan Law, he continued to provide generous time and support to both the Law School and the University, serving on the Law School's Campaign Steering Committee, and the University's President's Advisory Group, and the Investment Advisory Group. We will miss him greatly. President Mary Sue Coleman The University of Michigan

HEADLINE: Rewards, With Risks, Go Into the Sale of the G.M. Building

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
Harry B. Macklowe is in a hurry to sell all or part of the General Motors Building to raise cash to pay billions of dollars in debts due in less than three weeks.
 But the rival developer Sheldon H. Solow's relentless pursuit of the 50-story white marble tower on Fifth Avenue, considered one of the biggest real estate trophies in New York, may put a kink in the sale, which officially began on Friday night when a confidentiality agreement went out to prospective buyers. The maneuvering is only the latest example of how the blood sport known as real estate is played in New York.
 On Jan. 11, Judge Barbara S. Jones of United States District Court surprised many real estate executives by ruling that a lawsuit filed by Mr. Solow, alleging fraud in the original 2003 sale of the skyscraper to Mr. Macklowe, could move forward. 
 At the very least, real estate lawyers and executives say, the suit could put a damper on bidding, with potential buyers demanding that Mr. Macklowe indemnify them against a courtroom victory by Mr. Solow. Friends of Mr. Macklowe say that no one takes the suit by Mr. Solow seriously, although some experts say it could hobble Mr. Macklowe's ability to raise money and lead to the collapse of his empire.
 ''The judge's decision could put the brakes on any sale, or at a minimum change the economics,'' said Ross Moskowitz, a real estate partner at Stroock & Stroock & Lavan. ''Unless there is a comfort level on the merits of the litigation with a meaningful indemnification, any prospective buyer and lender would have to think long and hard about moving forward with this purchase.'' 
 Mr. Solow owns another prominent skyscraper, on West 57th Street, and he clearly wants to add the G.M. Building as a bookend to his collection. He contends that he was the highest bidder to Conseco, the financial services company that sold the property in August 2003 to Mr. Macklowe for $1.4 billion. Mr. Solow says that his bid of $1.4 billion makes him its legitimate owner.
 Mr. Solow, who has filed more than 200 lawsuits with varying degrees of success, is suing Conseco, claiming that it set up a ''sham auction'' with the intent of eliciting ''stalking horse'' bids from other buyers, all the while intending to sell to Mr. Macklowe. 
 ''Mr. Solow's lawyers will vigorously pursue all his claims, including a claim for the building,'' a spokesman for Mr. Solow, Michael Gross, said.
 Responding in court, Conseco and Chuck Cremens, a consultant who oversaw the sale for Conseco, have said that Mr. Macklowe was the highest credible buyer. In any event, they say that the company expressly told bidders in sale documents that it ''could sell to whom it chose -- or to no one at all.'' 
 According to a deposition by Wayne L. Maggin, a broker for Eastdil Secured, who conducted the sale for Conseco, Mr. Solow submitted a bid for $1.4 billion, while Mr. Macklowe's two-part offer was for $1.365 billion and as much as $1.38 billion. Mr. Maggin said that Mr. Cremens authorized him the next morning to contact Mr. Macklowe and offer him the tower for $1.4 billion, if Mr. Macklowe provided a nonrefundable $50 million down payment.
 Mr. Solow's suit, however, contends that under New York law, Conseco had a legal and fiduciary obligation to conduct a fair auction and get the highest possible price for the property. Although Judge Jones dismissed Mr. Solow's request for a declaratory judgment and Conseco's motion for dismissal, she said that the case could go forward on the allegations that Conseco breached its duty to hold a fair auction and committed fraud. The decision was not a judgment on the merits of the case.
 Mr. Macklowe, who declined comment, has taken a keen interest in the suit. His lawyers have tried to quash a subpoena from Mr. Solow seeking information about Mr. Macklowe's debt obligations on the G.M. Building. In court papers, he referred to Mr. Solow's lawsuit as a ''thinly veiled attempt by one player in the New York real estate market to obtain a broad swath of sensitive financial information about a competitor.''
 None of this helps the cash-strapped Mr. Macklowe, who owes Fortress Investment Group $1.35 billion, including interest, which is due on Feb. 9. Part of the collateral for that loan is a 49 percent interest in the limited partnership that owns the G.M. Building, along with Mr. Macklowe's personal guarantee.
 He also owes Deutsche Bank $5.8 billion on a loan Mr. Macklowe used a year ago to buy seven Midtown office towers from Equity Office Properties. He is also in default on a $510 million loan for a development project at what was once the site of the Drake Hotel, at Park Avenue and 56th Street.
 The real estate industry generally agrees that Mr. Macklowe's properties are prime buildings in one of the world's best business districts. The question is whether Mr. Macklowe, a shrewd real estate gambler, can raise the cash he needs.
 For now, he has hired Darcy Stacom and Bill Shanahan, top sales brokers at CB Richard Ellis, to sell the G.M. Building for more than $3 billion, or to find a partner willing to invest. 
 Real estate executives fear that Mr. Macklowe's travail could be a harbinger of problems to come in the city. Vacancy rates remain relatively low, but the problems in the credit markets could translate into layoffs, especially in the financial industry.
 According to estimates by CB Richard Ellis, it would take about 60,000 layoffs in New York City and almost 15 million square feet of newly vacant space for the current market to turn sour for owners. At this point, said Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody's Economist.com, it seems pessimistic to suggest that layoffs would rise to that level. But, he said, ''I'd be surprised if the city gets away without a recession.''

HEADLINE: Editor Fires Parting Shot At His Chain

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
The ousted editor of The Los Angeles Times on Monday offered a scathing critique of the newspaper industry and specifically his longtime employer, the Tribune Company, arguing that cost cuts, a lack of investment and an aversion to serious news was damaging the business.
 The editor, James E. O'Shea, left after he refused to carry out another in a series of newsroom budget cuts sought by the publisher in Los Angeles, David D. Hiller -- 15 months after Mr. Hiller fired the previous editor over the same kind of dispute. 
 The current showdown and Mr. O'Shea's parting comments made for a remarkable statement by an editor who was seen as a Tribune loyalist and was sent to Los Angeles to calm a rebellious staff.
 ''I disagree completely with the way that this company allocates resources to its newsrooms, not just here but at Tribune newspapers all around the country,'' Mr. O'Shea wrote in a memo to the newspaper's staff, echoing farewell remarks he made Monday morning in the newsroom.
 The chairman and chief executive who took control of Tribune a month ago, Samuel Zell, sided with Mr. Hiller. Mr. Zell had criticized the previous management's cost-cutting and said that further reductions were not the road to prosperity. But he has also said that he was giving Tribune managers greater autonomy.
 ''I've said loud and clear that I'm returning control of our businesses to the people who run them,'' Mr. Zell said in a statement, in response to coverage of Mr. O'Shea's departure. ''That means David Hiller has my full support. He carries direct responsibility for the staffing and financial success of The L.A. Times. I understand that David and Jim, together, came to the conclusion that Jim's departure was the best decision for the direction and future of The L.A. Times.''
 Mr. O'Shea said repeatedly that he was forced out; other Times executives said he was fired. But Mr. Hiller said in an interview Monday, ''I thought it was a mutual conclusion that it was time to part ways.''
 Times executives, who were granted anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter, said the confrontation had been brewing for more than a month and reached a turning point about a week ago.
 Speculation about a successor focused on Russ Stanton, formerly the business editor at The Times, who has been the innovation editor for a year, overseeing the newspaper's Web site. Mr. Hiller said he expected to name an editor in a few days.
 Mr. O'Shea argued in the memo that The Times had shown several times -- in revising its Sunday magazine, in adding fashion coverage -- that it could generate more revenue and higher profit by offering more, not less.
 ''Even in hard times, wise investment -- not retraction -- is the long-term answer to the industry's troubles,'' he wrote, while suggesting that Tribune executives have been unable to see the logic of anything but budget cuts.
 ''Journalists and not accountants should seize responsibility for the financial health of our newspapers,'' he wrote, ''so journalists can make decisions about the size of our staffs and how much news remains in our papers and Web sites.''
 But Mr. Hiller said the paper was investing as much as it could, especially in its Web site, and the cuts were nothing more than an acceptance of reality. 
 ''Last year, our operating cash flow went down by about 20 percent,'' he said.
 ''Can you solve the newspaper industry's problems by spending more?'' Mr. Hiller said. ''It's an attractive theory, but it doesn't work.''
 Mr. Zell took control of Tribune last month in an $8.2 billion transaction that took the company private. He said at the time that he was confident that the company could find revenue.
 In the last year, the newspaper industry has suffered a steep decline in advertising revenue, and Tribune has been hit harder than most. The slumping real estate markets in California and Florida have cut deeply into real estate ads, and Tribune has big papers in both states. In addition, analysts say that years of turmoil at The Times has hurt ad sales; Mr. Hiller agreed that the tumult has been a distraction.
 The company's most recent detailed financial report, for the third quarter of 2007, said that classified ad revenue was down 18 percent from the period a year earlier, including a 26 percent drop in real estate ads. Los Angeles had one of the worst declines.
 Through three quarters last year, the company had an operating profit margin of 16 percent, down from 19 percent the year earlier. But with sharply higher debt service costs because of the takeover, net income fell by more than half, to 4 percent.
 Times executives say the paper still has a double-digit operating profit margin, though the number has dropped steeply.
 Mr. Hiller said that Mr. O'Shea asked for a $3 million increase in the newsroom budget. He said he told Mr. O'Shea at first that he expected to keep the figure at $120 million, unchanged from last year. 
 Mr. O'Shea argued that a flat budget amounted to a 4 percent cut, given the costs of covering a presidential campaign and the Olympics in Beijing -- to say nothing of inflation.
 Tribune took over the Times Mirror Company, the parent company of The Times in 2000, and with executives in Chicago repeatedly seeking a smaller newsroom, relations with Los Angeles have been rocky ever since. The Times has a news staff of about 870 people, down from more than 1,100 a few years ago, but still larger than the roughly 600 of the flagship paper, The Chicago Tribune.
 Since the takeover by Tribune, turnover has been frequent in The Times's top positions, in the newsroom and on the business side. Mr. Hiller is the third publisher installed by Tribune, and Mr. O'Shea's successor will be the fourth top editor.
 John S. Carroll, the first editor installed by Tribune, quit in 2005 rather than make more newsroom budget cuts. The next year, his successor, Dean P. Baquet, and the publisher, Jeffrey M. Johnson -- who, like Mr. O'Shea, was a longtime Tribune employee -- were fired when they refused to do more cutting.

HEADLINE: Renewed Optimism For a Global Deal

BYLINE: By STEPHEN CASTLE

 BODY:
Negotiators for the European Union and the United States said that they hoped a meeting of trade ministers in Davos, Switzerland, this week could help restart global trade talks and pave the way for a deal. Begun in 2001 to help increase trade and develop the economies of poorer countries, the talks have already missed a succession of deadlines. The European trade commissioner, Peter Mandelson, sought to increase pressure for a breakthrough after a meeting on Monday with Susan C. Schwab, above, the United States trade representative. ''We are rapidly moving toward a moment of truth,'' Mr. Mandelson said.

HEADLINE: Remarks On Reagan Live On

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY

 BODY:
In one of their starkest differences in Monday's debate, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton said that Senator Barack Obama had talked about ''admiring Ronald Reagan'' and that Mr. Obama ''said in the last week that he really liked the ideas of the Republicans over the last 10 to 15 years, and we can give you the exact quote.'' 
 Mr. Obama responded by saying, ''What I said was is that Ronald Reagan was a transformative political figure because he was able to get Democrats to vote against their economic interests to form a majority to push through their agenda, an agenda that I objected to.''
 At issue were remarks Mr. Obama made last week to The Reno Gazette-Journal. While he spoke positively of Reagan and described the Republicans as ''the party of ideas,'' he did not say that he admired Reagan.
 ''Ronald Reagan changed the trajectory of America in a way that, you know, Richard Nixon did not, and in a way that Bill Clinton did not,'' Mr. Obama told the newspaper. ''He put us on a fundamentally different path because the country was ready for it. He tapped into what people were already feeling, which is, we want clarity, we want optimism, we want, you know, a return to that sense of dynamism and, you know, entrepreneurship that had been missing.''
 At the debate, Mr. Obama said that Mrs. Clinton had ''provided much more fulsome praise'' of Reagan in Tom Brokaw's new book, ''Boom!,'' in which she is quoted as saying: ''When he had those big tax cuts and they went too far, he oversaw the largest tax increase. He could call the Soviet Union the Evil Empire and then negotiate arms-control agreements. He played the balance and the music beautifully.''

HEADLINE: The Voters Revolt

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
The Reagan administration had its pragmatists and its so-called ideologues. It had James Baker as well as Ed Meese. Reagan carried moderate states like Connecticut, Wisconsin and Washington, as well as conservative ones like Wyoming and South Carolina.
 But then a great tightening occurred. Conservative institutions and interest groups proliferated in Washington. The definition of who was a true conservative narrowed. It became necessary to pass certain purity tests -- on immigration, abortion, taxes and Terri Schiavo. 
 An oppositional mentality set in: if the liberals worried about global warming, it was necessary to regard it as a hoax. If The New York Times editorial page worried about waterboarding, then the code of conservative correctness required one to think it O.K.
 Apostates and deviationists were expelled or found wanting, and the boundaries of acceptable thought narrowed. Moderate Republicans were expelled for squishiness. Millions of coastal suburbanites left the party in disgust. 
 And still the corset tightened. Many professional conservatives do not regard Mike Huckabee or John McCain as true conservatives. ''I'm here to tell you, if either of these two guys get the nomination, it's going to destroy the Republican Party,'' Rush Limbaugh said recently on his radio show. ''It's going to change it forever, be the end of it.'' 
 Some of the contributors to The National Review's highly influential blog, The Corner, look to Fred Thompson and Mitt Romney to save the conservative movement. Their hatred of McCain is so strong, it's earned its own name: McCain Derangement Syndrome.
 Yet a funny thing has happened this primary season. Conservative voters have not followed their conservative leaders. Conservative voters are much more diverse than the image you'd get from conservative officialdom.
 In South Carolina, 34 percent of the Republican voters called themselves ''very conservative,'' but another 34 percent called themselves only ''somewhat conservative'' and another 24 percent called themselves ''moderate.'' Only 28 percent of the primary voters there said that abortion should be ''always illegal.'' This, I repeat, was in South Carolina, one of the most right-wing places in the country.
 While various conservative poobahs threaten to move to Idaho if Huckabee or McCain gets the nomination, the silent majority of conservative voters seem to like these candidates. Huckabee has done very well among evangelical voters while loudly deviating from conservative economic orthodoxy. John McCain leads among Republicans nationally. He has a 71 percent favorable rating and a 23 percent unfavorable rating. He has a 63 percent favorability rating among Huckabee supporters, 66 percent favorability among Romney supporters and 81 percent favorability among supporters of Rudy Giuliani. These are much higher second choice ratings than any other candidate.
 McCain's winning coalition in South Carolina was pretty broad. He lost among the extremely conservative but won among the somewhat conservative and the moderates. He lost among those who go to church more than once a week, but won among weekly churchgoers. He won among those who strongly support the Bush administration and among those who are angry at the Bush administration, among those who strongly support the war and among those who strongly oppose it. He won every income group over $30,000.
 Even among people who want to deport every immigrant, McCain only lost to Huckabee by 34 percent to 26 percent.
 The fact is, this has been a bad year for the conservative establishment. Fred Thompson was supposed to embody the party line, but he has fizzled (despite being a good campaigner the past month). Rudy Giuliani proposes deep tax cuts that do not seem to excite. Mitt Romney ran as the movement candidate in Iowa and New Hampshire and grossly underperformed. Now he's running as a nonideological business pragmatist for the exurban office parks, and his campaign has possibilities.
 The lesson is not that the conservative establishment is headed for the ash heap. The lesson is that the Republican Party, even in its shrunken state, is diverse. Regular Republican voters don't seem to mind independent thinking. There's room for moderates as well as orthodox conservatives. Limbaugh, Grover Norquist and James Dobson have influence, but they are not arbiters of conservative doctrine. 
 In his South Carolina victory speech, McCain defined a more inclusive conservatism: ''We want government to do its job, not your job; to do it better and to do it with less of your money; to defend our nation's security wisely and effectively, because the cost of our defense is so dear to us; to respect our values because they are the true source of our strength; to enforce the rule of law that is the first defense of freedom; to keep the promises it makes to us and not make promises it will not keep.'' 
 And McCain's success has raised an astonishing specter: Republicans may actually have a shot at winning this year.

HEADLINE: Craig Romney Promotes His Father, en Espanol

BYLINE: By SARAH WHEATON

 BODY:
Mitt Romney on Monday began running the following television commercial, his first in Spanish, in Miami, where Spanish-speaking voters make up a large proportion of the electorate.
 PRODUCER Midnight Ride Media 
 THE SCRIPT In Spanish, Craig Romney, one of the candidate's sons, says: ''Mitt Romney's record speaks for itself: successful as a businessman, saved the Olympics and as governor of Massachusetts, lowered taxes and stimulated the economy. But above all, Mitt Romney is a family man, a great father, husband and grandfather. I know because Mitt Romney is my dad. I'm Craig Romney and I invite you to get to know my father, Mitt Romney, a leader who loves our nation, recognizes our challenges and has solutions to confront them.'' Then the elder Mr. Romney says, also in Spanish, ''I'm Mitt Romney and I approved this message.''
 ON THE SCREEN The spot begins with a montage of standard still photos of Mr. Romney, the solitary executive, giving speeches and holding news conferences, as well as a magazine spread about his role in the Olympics with the headline ''Lord of the Rings.'' After 10 seconds, gauzy home video of Mr. Romney surrounded by his extended family in a living room begins, with shots of the candidate washing dishes and receiving an exuberant hug from a grandson. Another shot features Craig Romney, the narrator, labeling him ''hijo'' (son). After some more stills of Mr. Romney, the spot closes with another home video of him reading a book aloud to a huddle of young grandchildren.
 ACCURACY Mitt Romney started Bain Capital, an investment firm specializing in leveraged buyouts that developed a reputation for shoring up sinking companies. During his 15-year tenure it grew in core value to $10 billion from $6 billion. He is also credited with successfully running the 2002 Winter Games in Salt Lake City after he was tapped to come in after financial troubles and accusations of corruption. As far as stimulating the economy, Massachusetts did receive a credit rating upgrade while he was governor; and the real output of goods and services grew, though below the average national rate. And the state's rate of job creation was among the lowest in the country during that period. 
 SCORECARD Mr. Romney is hoping to build on his victories in Michigan and Nevada in Florida, where he is in a tight four-way race. With this advertisement, he is going after Cubans and other Florida Hispanics, a group also being courted heavily by Rudolph W. Giuliani and Senator John McCain, who was in the Little Havana section of Miami on Monday. 
 SARAH WHEATON 

CORRECTION-DATE: January 23, 2008

 CORRECTION:
An article on Tuesday about a new television advertisement in Spanish for the Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney misstated the value of his company, Bain Capital, at the beginning of his tenure there. It was $36 million, not $6 billion.

HEADLINE: Obama and Clinton Square Off; Debate on Issues Turns Personal

BYLINE: By PATRICK HEALY and JEFF ZELENY; Patrick Healy reported from New York, and Jeff Zeleny from Myrtle Beach, S.C. Julie Bosman contributed reporting from Myrtle Beach, and Kitty Bennett from Washington.

 BODY:
In the most intense and personal exchange of the presidential campaign, Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama assailed each other's integrity and voting records during a televised debate on Monday in South Carolina, the site of a critical primary in five days.
 If the debate was full of memorable moments -- Mrs. Clinton accusing Mr. Obama of associating with a ''slum landlord,'' Mr. Obama saying he felt as if he were running against both Hillary and Bill Clinton, the two candidates talking over each other -- the totality of the attacks also laid bare the ill will and competitive ferocity that has been simmering between them for weeks.
 ''You know, Senator Obama, it is very difficult having a straight-up debate with you, because you never take responsibility for any vote, and that has been a pattern,'' Mrs. Clinton said, drawing a chorus of jeers from a crowd at the Palace Theater in Myrtle Beach, S.C.
 Mr. Obama shot back that Mrs. Clinton was conducting a brand of negative politics that, he suggested throughout the night, she and her husband had perfected: ''comb my 4,000 votes in Illinois, choose one, try to present it in the worst possible light.'' He added that he had sought to maintain ''a certain credibility'' in the race. 
 Both candidates believe the Democratic nomination could be sealed in the next six weeks, and they used this debate, the second-to-last one of the primary season, to unload their best opposition research and sound bites against each other. In some cases, it was the first time the candidates had personally confronted each other on potentially embarrassing points.
 As she has never done before, Mrs. Clinton linked Mr. Obama to a longtime fund-raiser, whom she characterized as a slumlord in ''inner-city Chicago.'' 
 Mrs. Clinton was referring to Mr. Obama's ties to Antoin Rezko, a Chicago businessman who was indicted last fall on federal charges of business fraud and influence peddling connected to the administration of Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich of Illinois. Mr. Obama did work for a law firm in Chicago and performed legal work involving Mr. Rezko's housing developments. On Saturday, Mr. Obama returned more than $40,000 in political contributions that were linked to Mr. Rezko. 
 And Mr. Obama, who appeared on the verge of losing his temper at times, noted that she was on the board of Wal-Mart while he was working on ''the streets'' as a Chicago community organizer. Mrs. Clinton was a director of Wal-Mart from 1986 to 1992.
 The third Democratic contender, John Edwards, had to fight to speak. He tried to portray himself as the only candidate who was focusing on the real issues, criticizing the others for squabbling among themselves when health care and other issues go unresolved. At the same time, he tried make an appeal for his own electability in November against a Republican candidate like John McCain, saying he could ''go every place'' in the country to campaign. 
 Mr. Edwards, the winner of the South Carolina primary in 2004, also slashed into his leading rival in the state, Mr. Obama, by portraying him as weak-willed for voting ''present'' -- rather than yea or nay -- on scores of bills as an Illinois state senator. 
 For the most part, the sparring focused on the major issues in the primary contest, from the candidates' plans on the economy and universal health care to their past and current positions on the Iraq war and free trade. Yet at the same time, the subtext of the attacks dwelled on honesty and accountability, with Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama repeatedly implying that voters could not trust the opponent's words.
 Mr. Obama was as heated and intense as he has been at any debate over the last year. At times, he appeared angry and close to expressing it at Mrs. Clinton -- and also at her husband, Bill Clinton, whom Mr. Obama criticized frequently during the debate for what he said were distortions of his views and record by the former president.
 ''I'm here,'' Mrs. Clinton said, ''not my husband.''
 Mr. Obama snapped, ''I can't tell who I'm running against sometimes.'' At several other points, he used the phrase ''Senator Clinton and President Clinton'' to re-enforce his view that he is facing off against a decades-old Clinton machine.
 Mr. Clinton was neither onstage nor in the audience, but he played a central role in the debate. Asked whether he had crossed the line as a former president, Mrs. Clinton smiled and raised the names of both of her rivals' wives.
 ''This campaign is not about our spouses, it's about us. Michelle and Elizabeth are strong and staunch advocates for their husbands,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ''At the end of the day, voters are going to have to choose among us.''
 Still, the questions persisted about Mr. Clinton, who is scheduled to spend the week campaigning in South Carolina as Mrs. Clinton travels elsewhere. Mr. Obama, who would be the nation's first black president, was asked about how the author Toni Morrison had bestowed that title on Mr. Clinton more than a decade ago.
 ''I think Bill Clinton did have an enormous affinity with the African-American community,'' Mr. Obama said, praising Mr. Clinton for his longtime commitment to racial equality as a man who grew up in the South. 
 Lightening the moment, he added: ''I would have to investigate more Bill's dancing abilities and some of this other stuff before I accurately judged whether in fact he was a brother.''
 Mrs. Clinton replied, ''I am sure that can be arranged.'' 
 The South Carolina primary is the fourth showdown of the fight for the Democratic nomination: Mr. Obama won the first, the Iowa caucuses, where Mrs. Clinton came in third, but she rebounded and won the next two contests, in New Hampshire and last Saturday in Nevada. Mr. Obama appears to hold a strong lead in public polls in South Carolina; Mrs. Clinton is spending time and resources there this week, but she is also campaigning in other states in the next two days, in part to lower expectations for her performance there.
 In those three contests, Mr. Edwards did not end up in a leading spot, and in the debate he sought to break through and connect with his fellow Southerners. (He was born in South Carolina and lives in North Carolina.)
 ''There are three people in this debate, not two,'' Mr. Edwards reminded Wolf Blitzer, the moderator of the debate, which was sponsored by the Congressional Black Caucus and shown on CNN. ''I also want to know on behalf of voters in South Carolina, how many children are going to get health care because of this? We have got to understand that this is not about us personally.''
 Mr. Edwards made a labored effort to highlight what he called his electability in the general election, referring to himself as ''the white male'' candidate, a phrase that became a point of playful banter between him and Mr. Obama, who often referred to the fact that a woman and a black man are running.

HEADLINE: As Musharraf Tours Europe, Position at Home Grows More Uncertain

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan 

 BODY:
President Pervez Musharraf is touring European capitals and plans to attend the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Wednesday in a bid to show that he remains in charge of his troubled country, where his popular support has never been at such a low ebb. 
 On the tour, his first major trip abroad since stepping down as army chief last month, Mr. Musharraf intends to show his resolve in fighting terrorism and to talk up investment opportunities, his aides said. 
 But his pitch, after the assassination of the opposition leader Benazir Bhutto, will be made in the shadow of a rapidly escalating jihadist insurgency, an economy suffering from sudden power and wheat shortages, and worries that elections, which have been delayed to Feb. 18, will not be free and fair.
 The pillars of Mr. Musharraf's strength as a ruler over the past eight years -- national stability and security, with an army capable of withstanding the insurgency, and a flourishing economy -- are being severely challenged, his supporters and critics say. Suicide bombers have struck three of Pakistan's major cities -- Karachi, Lahore and Peshawar -- killing dozens of people in the past 10 days. 
 In a public opinion poll by Gallup Pakistan this month, 68 percent of some 1,300 respondents who were asked in random, face-to-face interviews whether Mr. Musharraf should resign or stay said they thought he should go.
 The results mirrored an even larger opinion survey by the International Republican Institute, a nonprofit group based in Washington that is affiliated with the Republican Party and promotes democracy abroad. That survey was published in December, before Ms. Bhutto was assassinated and the elections were postponed. 
 Politicians who have backed Mr. Musharraf say that his popularity among all classes of Pakistanis has plummeted to its lowest point yet, damaged by missteps starting nearly a year ago when he fired the chief justice of the Supreme Court. 
 They said he was hurt further by his imposition of six weeks of emergency rule late in the year, and by the arrests of thousands of critics, most of them now freed.
 Mr. Musharraf has ruled the country since he took power in a bloodless coup late in 1999, retaining his post as military chief while assuming the role of president. Over time, the dual roles stirred popular and judicial resistance, and opponents demanded that he surrender his military post. 
 In December, Mr. Musharraf stepped down as leader of the army and two days later was sworn in for a new five-year term as president, having been re-elected by national and provincial assemblies in October. 
 Support for Mr. Musharraf within the army, which is considered Pakistan's most important institution and is under growing pressure from the insurgency, is hard to gauge accurately, said two Western diplomats who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The successor Mr. Musharraf has chosen to lead the army, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, is not expected to abandon him in the short term, the diplomats said. 
 They noted that General Kayani took steps last week to distance the military from politics by issuing a directive that army officers were no longer permitted to contact politicians. He has also been reported to be likely to recall army officers who had been posted to top slots in government departments when Mr. Musharraf was in charge of the military. 
 Over all, Mr. Musharraf faces opposition led by the elite of society -- doctors, engineers, lawyers -- a challenge different from the traditional opposition in Pakistan, which comes from the streets, said Ijaz Shafi Gilani, chairman of Gallup Pakistan, in an interview on Friday. 
 ''These are people who have benefited economically from the Musharraf regime, but what makes them work toward his departure is the feeling of a sense of national humiliation,'' he said. 
 Major business leaders, though, still support Mr. Musharraf, a result of the strong economic growth that has benefited them, if not the average Pakistani, said Wamiq Zuberi, chief editor of The Business Recorder, a daily newspaper, and chairman of an independent television station, Aaj TV. Whether the business support will last, he said, is uncertain. 
 ''By and large, big business has not turned against him, but they're quite perturbed by the way things are going,'' he said. ''Definitely nobody in the country can be satisfied with the law-and-order situation and the suicide bombings.'' 
 As the political and security uncertainties have unfolded, shortages of electricity, gas and wheat have compounded anxieties. After the government -- relying on what proved to be underestimates of domestic consumption -- decided to export wheat last year, its price soared. Lines for flour at high prices have been the norm in the past few weeks. 
 Similarly, the Musharraf government underestimated sharp increases in energy consumption, while power-plant construction has been slower than expected. One result has been nightly blackouts in cities and villages. 
 Analysts contend that Ms. Bhutto's assassination on Dec. 27 has caused widespread resentment of Mr. Musharraf, and that many Pakistanis blame the government for her death.
 Increasingly, politicians say Mr. Musharraf's faction of the Pakistan Muslim League has become so unpopular that candidates who formerly ran on that ticket are jumping ship. 
 One such candidate who has shifted to the Pakistan Peoples Party that had been led by Ms. Bhutto, Firdaus Ashiq Awan, 35, said she felt let down by the president's record. 
 ''I joined him because he was going to introduce a seven-point reform agenda, and make the political people accountable to the Constitution,'' said Ms. Awan, a physician who is running in the province of Punjab against a more seasoned candidate in Mr. Musharraf's party. ''But instead of being a reformer he has bulldozed everything.'' 
 In a measure of the sea change in attitudes toward Mr. Musharraf, for the first time on Sunday, a major Pakistani newspaper suggested in an editorial that it was time for him to exit. 
 The editorial in the newspaper, The Daily Times, written under a code of conduct that forbids direct criticism of Mr. Musharraf, appeared two days after Mr. Musharraf gave a major interview to the editors of Pakistan's leading newspapers. 
 The editorial said, ''Without being polemical about the right and wrong of presidential actions -- or blunders, as some would say -- the sheer burden of incumbency points to a transition away from him, even at the risk of getting the war on terrorism wrong.''

HEADLINE: In Matters Big and Small, Crossing Giuliani Had Price

BYLINE: By MICHAEL POWELL and RUSS BUETTNER

 BODY:
Rudolph W. Giuliani likens himself to a boxer who never takes a punch without swinging back. As mayor, he made the vengeful roundhouse an instrument of government, clipping anyone who crossed him.
 In August 1997, James Schillaci, a rough-hewn chauffeur from the Bronx, dialed Mayor Giuliani's radio program on WABC-AM to complain about a red-light sting run by the police near the Bronx Zoo. When the call yielded no results, Mr. Schillaci turned to The Daily News, which then ran a photo of the red light and this front page headline: ''GOTCHA!''
 That morning, police officers appeared on Mr. Schillaci's doorstep. What are you going to do, Mr. Schillaci asked, arrest me? He was joking, but the officers were not. 
 They slapped on handcuffs and took him to court on a 13-year-old traffic warrant. A judge threw out the charge. A police spokeswoman later read Mr. Schillaci's decades-old criminal rap sheet to a reporter for The Daily News, a move of questionable legality because the state restricts how such information is released. She said, falsely, that he had been convicted of sodomy. 
 Then Mr. Giuliani took up the cudgel.
 ''Mr. Schillaci was posing as an altruistic whistle-blower,'' the mayor told reporters at the time. ''Maybe he's dishonest enough to lie about police officers.'' 
 Mr. Schillaci suffered an emotional breakdown, was briefly hospitalized and later received a $290,000 legal settlement from the city. ''It really damaged me,'' said Mr. Schillaci, now 60, massaging his face with thick hands. ''I thought I was doing something good for once, my civic duty and all. Then he steps on me.''
 Mr. Giuliani was a pugilist in a city of political brawlers. But far more than his predecessors, historians and politicians say, his toughness edged toward ruthlessnessand became a defining aspect of his mayoralty. One result: New York City spent at least $7 million in settling civil rights lawsuits and paying retaliatory damages during the Giuliani years. 
 After AIDS activists with Housing Works loudly challenged the mayor, city officials sabotaged the group's application for a federal housing grant. A caseworker who spoke of missteps in the death of a child was fired. After unidentified city workers complained of pressure to hand contracts to Giuliani-favored organizations, investigators examined not the charges but the identity of the leakers.
 ''There were constant loyalty tests: 'Will you shoot your brother?' '' said Marilyn Gelber, who served as environmental commissioner under Mr. Giuliani. ''People were marked for destruction for disloyal jokes.''
 Mr. Giuliani paid careful attention to the art of political payback. When former Mayors Edward I. Koch and David N. Dinkins spoke publicly of Mr. Giuliani's foibles, mayoral aides removed their official portraits from the ceremonial Blue Room at City Hall. Mr. Koch, who wrote a book titled ''Giuliani: Nasty Man,'' shrugs.
 ''David Dinkins and I are lucky that Rudy didn't cast our portraits onto a bonfire along with the First Amendment, which he enjoyed violating daily,'' Mr. Koch said in a recent interview.
 Mr. Giuliani retails his stories of childhood toughness, in standing up to bullies who mocked his love of opera and bridled at his Yankee loyalties. Years after leaving Manhattan College, he held a grudge against a man who beat him in a class election. He urged his commissioners to walk out of City Council hearings when questions turned hostile. But in his 2002 book ''Leadership,'' he said his instructions owed nothing to his temper.
 ''It wasn't my sensitivities I was worried about, but the tone of civility I strived to establish throughout the city,'' he wrote. Mr. Giuliani declined requests to be interviewed for this article.
 His admirers, not least former Deputy Mayor Randy M. Mastro, said it was unfair to characterize the mayor as vengeful, particularly given the ''Herculean task'' he faced when he entered office in 1994. Mr. Giuliani's admirers claimed that the depredations of crack, AIDS, homicide and recession had brought the city to its knees, and that he faced a sclerotic liberal establishment. He wielded intimidation as his mace and wrested cost-savings and savings from powerful unions and politicians.
 ''The notion that the city needed broad-based change frightened a lot of entrenched groups,'' said Fred Siegel, a historian and author of ''The Prince of the City: Giuliani, New York and the Genius of American Life.'' ''He didn't want to be politic with them.''
 He cowed many into silence. Silence ensured the flow of city money.
 Andy Humm, a gay activist, worked for the Hetrick-Martin Institute, which pushed condom giveaways in public schools. When Mr. Giuliani supported a parental opt-out, the institute's director counseled silence to avoid losing city funds. ''He said, 'We're going to say it's not good, but we're not going to mention him,' '' Mr. Humm said.
 ''We were muzzled, and it was a disgrace.''
 Picking His Fights
 Mr. Giuliani says he prefers to brawl with imposing opponents. His father, he wrote in ''Leadership,'' would ''always emphasize: never pick on someone smaller than you. Never be a bully.''
 As mayor, he picked fights with a notable lack of discrimination, challenging the city and state comptrollers, a few corporations and the odd council member. But the mayor's fist also fell on the less powerful. In mid-May 1994, newspapers revealed that Mr. Giuliani's youth commissioner, the Rev. John E. Brandon, suffered tax problems; more troubling revelations seemed in the offing.
 At 7 p.m. on May 17, Mr. Giuliani's press secretary dialed reporters and served up a hotter story: A former youth commissioner under Mr. Dinkins, Richard L. Murphy, had ladled millions of dollars to supporters of the former mayor. And someone had destroyed Department of Youth Services records and hard drives and stolen computers in an apparent effort to obscure what had happened to that money.
 ''My immediate goal is to get rid of the stealing, to get rid of the corruption,'' Mr. Giuliani told The Daily News.
 None of it was true. In 1995, the Department of Investigation found no politically motivated contracts and no theft by senior officials. But Mr. Murphy's professional life was wrecked.
 ''I was soiled merchandise -- the taint just lingers,'' Mr. Murphy said in a recent interview.
 Not long after, a major foundation recruited Mr. Murphy to work on the West Coast. The group wanted him to replicate his much-honored concept of opening schools at night as community centers. A senior Giuliani official called the foundation -- a move a former mayoral official confirmed on the condition of anonymity for fear of embarrassing the organization -- and the prospective job disappeared.
 ''He goes to people and makes them complicit in his revenge,'' Mr. Murphy said. 
 This theme repeats. Two private employers in New York City, neither of which wanted to be identified because they feared retaliation should Mr. Giuliani be elected president, said the mayor's office exerted pressure not to hire former Dinkins officials. When Mr. Giuliani battled schools Chancellor Ramon C. Cortines, he demanded that Mr. Cortines prove his loyalty by firing the press spokesman, John Beckman.
 Mr. Beckman's offense? He had worked in the Dinkins administration. ''I found it,'' Mr. Beckman said in an interview, ''a really unfortunate example of how to govern.''
 Joel Berger worked as a senior litigator in the city corporation counsel's office until 1996. Afterward, he represented victims of police brutality and taught a class at the New York University School of Law, and his students served apprenticeships with the corporation counsel.
 In late August 1997, Mr. Berger wrote a column in The New York Times criticizing Mr. Giuliani's record on police brutality. A week later, a city official called the director of the N.Y.U. law school's clinical programs and demanded that Mr. Berger be removed from the course. Otherwise, the official said, we will suspend the corporation counsel apprenticeship, according to Mr. Berger and an N.Y.U. official.
 ''It was ridiculously petty,'' Mr. Berger said. 
 N.Y.U. declined to replace Mr. Berger and instead suspended the class after that semester.
 'Culture of Retaliation'
 The Citizens Budget Commission has driven mayors of various ideological stripes to distraction since it was founded in 1932. The business-backed group bird-dogs the city's fiscal management with an unsparing eye. But its analysts are fonts of creative thinking, and Mr. Giuliani asked Raymond Horton, the group's president, to serve on his transition committee in 1993.
 That comity was long gone by the autumn of 1997, when Mr. Giuliani faced re-election. Ruth Messinger, the mayor's Democratic opponent, cited the commission's work, and the mayor denounced the group, which had issued critical reports on welfare reform, police inefficiency and the city budget. 
 So far, so typical for mayors and their relationship with the commission. Mr. Koch once banned his officials from attending the group's annual retreat. Another time, he attended and gave a speech excoriating the commission. 
 But one of Mr. Giuliani's deputy mayors, Joseph Lhota, took an unprecedented step. He called major securities firms that underwrite city bonds and discouraged them from buying seats at the commission's annual fund-raising dinner. Because Mr. Lhota played a key role in selecting the investment firms that underwrote the bonds, his calls raised an ethical tempest.
 Apologizing struck Mr. Giuliani as silly. 
 ''We are sending exactly the right message,'' he said. ''Their reports are pretty useless; they are a dilettante organization.'' 
 Still, that dinner was a rousing success. ''All mayors have thin skins, but Rudy has the thinnest skin of all,'' Mr. Horton said. 
 Mr. Giuliani's war with the nonprofit group Housing Works was more operatic. Housing Works runs nationally respected programs for the homeless, the mentally ill and people who are infected with H.I.V. But it weds that service to a 1960s straight-from-the-rice-paddies guerrilla ethos.
 The group's members marched on City Hall, staged sit-ins, and delighted in singling out city officials for opprobrium. Mr. Giuliani, who considered doing away with the Division of AIDS Services, became their favorite mayor in effigy.
 Mr. Giuliani responded in kind. His police commanders stationed snipers atop City Hall and sent helicopters whirling overhead when 100 or so unarmed Housing Works protesters marched nearby in 1998. A year earlier, his officials systematically killed $6 million worth of contracts with the group, saying it had mismanaged funds. 
 Housing Works sued the city and discovered that officials had rescored a federal evaluation form to ensure that the group lost a grant from the Department of Housing and Urban Development. 
 Martin Oesterreich, the city's homeless commissioner, denied wrongdoing but acknowledged that his job might have been forfeited if Housing Works had obtained that contract.
 ''That possibility could have happened,'' Mr. Oesterreich told a federal judge. 
 The mayor's fingerprints could not be found on every decision. But his enemies were widely known.
 ''The culture of retaliation was really quite remarkable,'' said Matthew D. Brinckerhoff, the lawyer who represented Housing Works. ''Up and down the food chain, everyone knew what this guy demanded.''
 The Charter Fight
 The mayor's wartime style of governance reached an exhaustion point in the late 1990s. His poll numbers dipped, and the courts routinely ruled against the city, upholding the New York Civil Liberties Union in 23 of its 27 free-speech challenges during Mr. Giuliani's mayoralty. After he left office, the city agreed to pay $327,000 to a black police officer who was fired because he had testified before the City Council about police brutality toward blacks. The city also agreed to rescind the firing of the caseworker who talked about a child's death.
 In 1999, Mr. Giuliani explored a run for the United States Senate. If he won that seat, he would leave the mayor's office a year early. The City Charter dictated that Mark Green, the public advocate, would succeed him.
 That prospect was intolerable to Mr. Giuliani. Few politicians crawled under the mayor's skin as skillfully as Mr. Green. ''Idiotic'' and ''inane'' were some of the kinder words that Mr. Giuliani sent winging toward the public advocate, who delighted in verbally tweaking the mayor.
 So Mr. Giuliani announced in June 1999 that a Charter Revision Commission, stocked with his loyalists, would explore changing the line of mayoral succession. Mr. Giuliani told The New York Times Magazine that he might not have initiated the charter review campaign if Mr. Green were not the public advocate. Three former mayors declared themselves appalled; Mr. Koch fired the loudest cannonade. ''You ought to be ashamed of yourself, Mr. Mayor,'' he said during a news conference.
 Frederick A. O. Schwarz Jr., chairman of a Charter Revision Commission a decade earlier, wrote a letter to Mr. Giuliani warning that ''targeting a particular person'' would ''smack of personal politics and predilections.
 ''All this is not worthy of you, or our city,'' Mr. Schwarz wrote.
 Mr. Mastro, who had left the administration, agreed to serve as the commission chairman. He eventually announced that a proposal requiring a special election within 60 days of a mayor's early departure would not take effect until 2002, after both Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Green had left office. A civic group estimated that the commission spent more than a million dollars of taxpayer money on commercials before a citywide referendum on the proposal that was held in November 1999. 
 Voters defeated the measure, 76 percent to 24 percent. (In 2002, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg advocated a similar charter revision that passed with little controversy.)
 Mr. Green had warned the mayor that rejection loomed.
 ''It was simple,'' Mr. Green said. ''It was the mayor vindictively going after an institutional critic for doing his job.''
 None of this left the mayor chastened. In March 2000, an undercover officer killed Patrick Dorismond, a security guard, during a fight when the police mistook him for a drug dealer. The outcry infuriated the mayor, who released Mr. Dorismond's juvenile record, a document that legally was supposed to remain sealed. 
 The victim, Mr. Giuliani opined, was no ''altar boy.'' Actually, he was. (Mr. Giuliani later expressed regret without precisely apologizing.)
 James Schillaci, the Bronx whistle-blower, recalled reading those comments and shuddering at the memory. ''The mayor tarred me up; you know what that feels like?'' he said. ''I still have nightmares.''

CORRECTION-DATE: January 25, 2008

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article on Tuesday about Rudolph W. Giuliani's tenure as mayor of New York referred incorrectly in a quotation to the former director of a gay advocacy organization, the Hetrick-Martin Institute, who was mentioned in an anecdote about Mr. Giuliani's power to silence critics. The former director, who was not named in the article, is a woman, not a man. Also, a caption referred imprecisely to Andy Humm, a gay activist and former worker at Hetrick-Martin who supplied the anecdote. He said it was the agency that was muzzled out of fear of losing financing for AIDS programs; he did not say that he muzzled himself.

HEADLINE: What Money Can Buy: Influence

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

 BODY:
''Why isn't Warren Buffett making an investment in Citigroup when Kuwait is?'' asked Felix G. Rohatyn, the banker who helped save New York City from bankruptcy in the 1970s.
 Mr. Rohatyn poses a very good question. If all these government-controlled funds in Asia and the Middle East that have been falling over one another to buy up stakes in Citigroup, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley are so smart, where are all the big-name value investors like Mr. Buffett? Or are these foreigners just ''dumb money''?
 I had called Mr. Rohatyn, at 79 one of Wall Street's few still-working old wise men, to get his perspective on the recent influx of billions of dollars of foreign government-controlled investments in the United States. 
 With so much money pouring from so-called sovereign wealth funds -- pools of capital that foreign governments have set aside to make investments -- what does this mean for us? Is this just the latest chapter in globalization? Will our financial firms now be at the beck and call of foreign governments? Or is this phenomenon more benign -- even a good thing? 
 As it happens, Mr. Rohatyn, a soft-spoken man who can command a room with nary a word, had played an important role the last time foreign money noticeably washed across these shores. As an investment banker at Lazard Freres, he had advised both buyers and sellers during the Japanese shopping spree in the United States in the late 1980s, one that ended badly. 
 He later became ambassador to France under President Bill Clinton and remains the consigliere to top executives and government leaders around the world. 
 So back to the question at hand: Why were the Kuwaitis going where Warren Buffett feared to tread? 
 ''They have different objectives,'' Mr. Rohatyn said. It may be easy to herald these investments as gutsy, brilliant bets during a turbulent market or dismiss them as foolish -- look at how far the value of China's stake in the Blackstone Group has fallen. But according to Mr. Rohatyn, who is now a special adviser at Lehman Brothers, that's the wrong way to look at them.
 ''The big difference is the political element,'' he said. Mr. Buffett is seeking the best return when he invests; that's his only goal, Mr. Rohatyn said. For Dubai and China, whether the investment returns 10 percent or 20 percent -- or perhaps much less -- is almost beside the point, he suggests. What they really want is influence on the world stage, despite their insistence otherwise.
 He's right. While government-controlled funds swear up and down that their investments are purely financially motivated, they just can't be. 
 Sure, they have a ton of money that they have to put to ''work,'' but most of the recent big-ticket foreign investments have been made in a matter of weeks, by people with little history of investing in such large assets and with virtually no way to know how to value them. 
 (Yes, they have had help from brand-name advisers in the United States, but even John A. Thain, Merrill Lynch's new chief executive, has said he didn't know the extent of the problems at his own bank.) 
 ''They are making investments that they probably think are O.K. but not spectacular,'' Mr. Rohatyn said of government-controlled funds. For them, he contends, ''there has to be a political objective over and above the rate of return.''
 That is not to say that the Chinese, for example, believe they are making bad deals for political expediency. If you spend time talking to the investment professionals at sovereign wealth funds or their advisers, all they talk about are the financials of the deal and how the chance to take such large stakes represents a ''once-in-a-lifetime opportunity'' with ''huge upside.'' (I heard those exact lines at least a half a dozen times in the past couple of weeks.) Politics, they suggest, are irrelevant, or at least an afterthought. For them, it is just another transaction.
 But without being a conspiracy theorist, that is somewhat disingenuous. While the mandate of managers at sovereign wealth funds may be to make terrific investments, at the end of the day, every investment is still a function of the government. 
 The Chinese recently proved that point when the government, at the 11th hour, overruled management at China Development Bank, which was planning to invest about $2 billion in Citigroup. 
 Of course, government-controlled investors have gone to great lengths to portray their investments as purely passive. When the China Investment Corporation bought securities that could eventually give it 9.9 percent of Morgan Stanley, the bank said in a statement: ''C.I.C. will have no special rights of ownership and no role in the management of Morgan Stanley, including no right to designate a member of the firm's board of directors.''
 For the most part, investors and the United States government have bought that line. Senator Charles E. Schumer sounded the alarm bell slightly, but he's not ringing it that loudly. 
 ''Foreign investment, in general, strengthens our economy and creates jobs,'' he said at the time of the $6.6 billion infusion into Merrill Lynch. ''Because sovereign wealth funds, by definition, are potentially susceptible to noneconomic interests, the closer they come to exercising control and influence, the greater concerns we have.''
 Let's be honest. The idea that foreign investors have no influence because they don't have a seat on the board is laughable. Prince Walid bin Talal of Saudi Arabia doesn't have a seat on Citigroup's board, but he managed to play a pivotal role in the ouster of Charles O. Prince III and often appears to hold more sway than management. 
 Virtually every day we hear of another shareholder activist with a negligible investment in a business who has found a way to get a seat at the table. As Mr. Rohatyn says, ''You don't need to appoint two directors to a board to have influence when you own 10 percent of the company.''
 This is not a rallying cry for the United States to put up a protectionist fire wall around itself. That's not the right answer. But we do need to at least recognize what these investments mean for the future. 
 The threat, of course, is not immediate, nor glaringly obvious. But the next time the going gets tough at Morgan Stanley, there is likely to be a series of phone calls coming from China -- and just as with many other shareholder fights, its interests may not always align with everybody else's.
 At the same time, we should probably consider using our own openness to bring a bit more openness abroad. France, where Mr. Rohatyn spent time in the late 1990s, is hardly the right country to hold up as a bastion of capitalism, but do take note: President Nicolas Sarkozy recently made a good point in a speech before leaving for the Middle East. ''I believe in globalization,'' he said, ''but I don't accept that certain sovereign wealth funds can buy anything here and our own capitalists can't buy anything in their countries. I demand reciprocity.''
 When Mr. Rohatyn and I first started our conversation, he reminded me of a book published in 1959 called ''Power Without Property,'' about the modern-day shareholder. Mr. Rohatyn said with a chuckle, ''Now the book should be called 'Power With Property.' ''

HEADLINE: Without Proof, an Ivory-Billed Boom Goes Bust

BYLINE: By LARA FARRAR

DATELINE: BRINKLEY, Ark. 

 BODY:
David Baxter, 62, has hunted the Big Woods in eastern Arkansas for most of his life. But these days, his weapon of choice is an old 35-millimeter camera with a zoom lens, which he keeps in his blue pickup truck at all times just in case he comes across an ivory-billed woodpecker. 
 ''God help me, I am trying,'' said Mr. Baxter, who thinks nothing of camouflaging himself in front of old swampy cypress trees for up to three hours in case the elusive bird makes an appearance. ''No matter what I am doing, I am looking.'' 
 Before 2005, Mr. Baxter, along with many of his neighbors, had never heard of an ivory-billed woodpecker. They certainly never imagined such a creature would emerge from the darkness of extinction and become a symbol of hope for their increasingly endangered delta towns.
 But one day, it seemed one did.
 It has been almost three years since a research team, led by Cornell University and the Nature Conservancy, announced the rediscovery of the ivory-billed woodpecker in the Big Woods -- a 550,000-acre tract of bottomland hardwood forest. Researchers have also reported spotting an ivory-billed woodpecker in a northwest Florida swamp.
 The large, yellow-eyed bird had not been conclusively seen in the United States since around the end of World War II, and some scientists have questioned whether the more recent reports of sightings are legitimate. Nevertheless, the federal Fish and Wildlife Service has recommended spending $27 million on recovery efforts for the woodpecker.
 The patch of Arkansas bayou where the researchers said they spotted the bird is in the heart of Monroe County. Once an agricultural and manufacturing center, the county is now one of the poorest places in Arkansas. For its roughly 10,000 residents, the reported rediscovery of the ivory-billed woodpecker fired hopes of an economic turnaround not seen since the soybean boom of the 1970s.
 After the sighting was announced, local economies seemed to benefit for a while as scientists, bird-watchers and news media outlets from around the world flocked to Brinkley and to the other communities in the patchwork quilt of fragmented forest and farmland that surrounds the Big Woods. 
 ''People came from everywhere,'' said Gene DePriest, who still has an ivory-billed cheeseburger, salad and dessert on the menu of his barbecue restaurant in Brinkley. ''I sold over $20,000 worth of T-shirts in six months.''
 Lately, though, the ivory-billed boom has pretty much been a bust, especially since researchers and bird-watchers have, so far, failed to take a definitive picture of the woodpecker. A blurry video clip released when the rediscovery was announced failed to convince many ornithologists of the animal's existence. There have since been plenty of purported sightings, but still no picture.
 ''It has been kind of a disappointment,'' said Penny Childs, owner of Penny's Hair Care and creator of the ''woodpecker haircut,'' which she does not get many requests for anymore. ''The delta could use millions of dollars to build up our lives, but instead we struggle.''
 Mrs. Childs, 43, is still cutting hair, but just down the street from her small one room salon, an empty brick building is all that remains of the Ivory-Bill Nest gift shop, which closed last January. Down the street, the former Ivory-Billed Inn and R.V. Park is now a Days Inn. 
 ''I did invest a lot of money in stuff to sell, and I didn't even break even,'' Mrs. Childs said. ''I have got a whole yard full of wooden woodpeckers right now.''
 But beneath the disappointment and piles of unsold ivory-billed T-shirts, coffee cups and wooden woodpeckers, remnants of the bird are everywhere, and they can be found with people like Mr. Baxter.
 At his home, he has a brown briefcase full of photographs of birds. Most are blurry shots of hoot owls and hawks taken by an automatic camera he hung 10 feet up a tree in the middle of a swamp. But in two pictures, he swears he captured the ivory-billed.
 ''I know what I seen and what I didn't see,'' said Mr. Baxter, holding two 3x5 photos with tiny black flecks flying against a deep blue sky. ''I have been a hunter all my life, so I know my birds.''

HEADLINE: Going Far While Staying Close to Home

BYLINE: By ZACHARY BRAZILLER

 BODY:
Life is good for Jessica McEntee. She has an apartment in the West Village, a 3.0 grade-point average at New York University and all-American recognition on the nation's No. 3-ranked Division III women's basketball team. 
 Her success is a credit to her hard work, toughness and a mature decision. 
 As a freshman, McEntee appeared in 25 games as a reserve despite having mononucleosis. In her sophomore season, she broke her nose and was forced to wear a bulky mask while playing. 
 Yet McEntee, a versatile 5-foot-11 forward, led the Violets to their first Final Four since 1997, when they won their only national championship. She was a unanimous second-team all-American selection by Women's DIII News and d3hoops.com; was one of 10 players honored by Kodak/WBCA; and was voted the University Athletic Association Player of the Year. 
 Those accomplishments were made possible by the choice she made her senior year of high school. 
 A four-year honor roll student at Archbishop Molloy High School in Queens, McEntee was going to pick a college based on its basketball program and the quality of its academics. 
 Several Division I programs pursued her, as did Ivy League universities like Penn and Cornell, and others from the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference and the Patriot League. 
 While rifling through several boxes of college letters, McEntee and her parents, Linda and John, came across one from N.Y.U. 
 There was something different about the Violets, a Division III power. Their coach, Janice Quinn, could not offer a full scholarship like some of the other suitors. What she could offer was a chance to play four years with a shot to win a national championship, plus a solid education and the opportunity for McEntee to live her college years in New York. 
 The biggest hurdle for the McEntees was the $45,000 a year it would cost for Jessica to attend N.Y.U. 
 ''Obviously that was a concern,'' said Linda McEntee, who like her husband is a lawyer. Referring to Quinn, she added, ''She made a crack that Jess would make it back in two years.'' 
 For McEntee, there was an added concern of playing at the Division III level. But Quinn quickly sold McEntee and her parents on her program. The university's proximity to their home in Flushing was another benefit.
 ''I loved everything about N.Y.U. before I got here, and I love everything about it since being here,'' McEntee said. ''I really made the right decision.'' 
 Quiet and shy, McEntee has let her work ethic do the talking. 
 A relentless presence under the basket and in the weight room, McEntee refused to slow down even when she was fighting mononucleosis, missing only one game and a few practices.
 ''She showed us guts, she showed us perseverance, she showed us mental toughness, she showed us physical toughness,'' said Quinn, who said having McEntee on her team was like having an extension of the coaching staff on the court. ''You ask her to do something, she figures it out. She does it immediately. She learns, she changes, she adapts.'' 
 McEntee blossomed in her sophomore season and led the Violets in scoring (16.9) and rebounding (12.5). Her breakout was not obvious at first, her teammate and close friend Sarah McDevitt said, because McEntee does ''all the little things on the court.'' 
 She scored 36 points against Emory last February, a career high at the time, and continued her hot hand in the N.C.A.A. tournament with a 34-point performance in a second-round victory over Gwynedd-Mercy.
 This season, McEntee is averaging 20.5 points and 11.7 rebounds a game, including a 38-point effort against New Paltz on Dec. 1, as N.Y.U. has rolled to a 13-1 start. She became the first Division III player to be named the Metropolitan Basketball Writers' Association player of the week in consecutive weeks twice. 
 Her success does not stop on the court. An economics major with a minor in business, McEntee is not certain what her postcollege plans are, but she said she is looking to get an internship on Wall Street this summer. 
 Despite growing up about 30 minutes from Manhattan, McEntee said she rarely visited. But in the past few years she has made up for those missed trips, watching Broadway performances, walking into film sets in Washington Square Park, taking in museum exhibits and learning to navigate the subway. 
 ''She's an expert now,'' John McEntee said. 
 She has also become a basketball star while gaining an education and without having to go far from home. It is a reward for the decision she made three years ago. 
 ''It couldn't have worked out better,'' she said.

Thinking About Meat
 To the Editor:
 Re ''Chefs' New Goal: Looking Dinner in the Eye'' (Jan. 16): 
 Jamie Oliver's sacrificial performance surely opened eyes to the intimacies of eating meat. The reality is, we depend on a world of slaughterers and butchers. The factory processors that box tens of thousands of carcasses a day have suffocated the small, independent houses that were typically the linchpins between nearby family farmers and chefs. These appropriately sized outfits tend to uphold humane ethics on the kill floor, honor animals' lives and respect farmers' efforts to raise animals responsibly, high standards that are all dramatically lowered with the productivity demands of mass production. 
 By overlooking the dying art of civilized slaughter and custom butchering, we risk losing a piece of history, a viable livelihood and the proper conditions that produce the meats we crave. My hope is that Mr. Oliver's splash will be more than a splash in the pan, and that it continues to inspire reverence and economic support for those who handle our foods in their final moments.

 To the Editor:
 Thank goodness for the likes of the chefs Jamie Oliver, Dan Barber and David Burke. As a former waitress, I cannot count how many simpering customers complain about having to see bones in their meat or eyes on their fish -- as if the skeletal remains of a once sentient being have no connection to the fillet on their plates. If you can not look a Mediterranean daurade in the eye, you have no right to eat it!
 No less aggravating are the dainty eaters leaving piles of sea scallops (overfished) or steak on their plates because they ''don't like leftovers.'' With our environment in a state of peril, we must stop subtracting our conscience from the food chain. If we acknowledge the lives and deaths of the animals we eat, perhaps we will eat fewer animals to the benefit of our bodies, our souls, the animals and the environment we all inhabit. Mary Hammett
 New York
 To the Editor:
 On the same day that The Times gave front-page coverage to the F.D.A.'s approval of cloned chickens, cows and pigs for our tables, your section discusses the trend of chefs getting close to the animals they eventually slaughter. In either case, the animals are dying for our taste buds. Maybe it's more honest to get to know the animal, but it changes the outcome not one bit.
 Wayne Johnson
 Brooklyn
 To the Editor: 
 Are we to believe the chefs who have the courage to look the animal in the eye before killing it are more compassionate? Killing innocent life is killing is killing is killing. A plant-based diet is better for human health and spares the chef the agony of the betrayal of the animal she or he looks in the eye before killing it. 
 Vegetarians and vegans have better physical health and mental health because our consciences are clear and free of guilt. That is something the chef can look right in our eyes and see.

HEADLINE: (Solar) Power to the People Is Not So Easily Achieved

BYLINE: By JIM DWYER. 
E-Mail: dwyer@nytimes.com

 BODY:
One day nearly four years ago, it suddenly seemed like a good idea to give solar electricity a try at home -- home, for me, being an apartment house in Washington Heights, alias upstate Manhattan. The price of electricity was climbing. A war was being fought, if not over oil, then certainly over the ground the oil was in. Solar technology had proven that it could generate real power. 
 And while the building may not have been in the eternal sunshine of Arizona, it does stand on one of the highest spots in Manhattan. The first rays of the morning come blazing into the windows on its east side, and the last tangle of daylight bounces off the west side. The roof bakes in the sun all day. As far as I could tell, our building needed only one star aligned in its favor, and we happened to be locked in at just the right spot. 
 Oh blissed ignorance.
 So now, a few lessons from a private co-op apartment building that is getting enough solar power, during daylight hours, to run the elevators, the laundry room, and the hall lights.
 Crowded as New York is at ground level, it is the Great Plains of roofs, with acres and acres of sunny, open space. Anyone so inclined can write a big check and probably get electricity from solar panels in a few months.
 If, on the other hand, you want the panels to make a semblance of economic sense -- if, for instance, you live in a 50-year-old building that has bills to pay -- the path becomes serpentine and the pace drops to a crawl. 
 New Yorkers pay a small monthly fee on their utility bills that goes toward a fund for energy improvements, administered by the New York State Energy Research Development Authority, the main wrangler of incentives for alternative energy. (www.nyserda.org) 
 Four solar companies gave us proposals. All of them said that since the building had a one-story garage, it would be much less expensive to put the panels on that low roof rather than on the building's roof, saving the cost of about 170 feet of cable and conduit. The lowest price, after negotiation, was $370,000 from Altpower of Manhattan for a 50-kilowatt system, about 25 percent less than the average cost per watt in the state. It was still a ton of money, considering how much electricity the system would provide.
 We gathered capital from state grants and tax credits amounting to $265,000, and financed the balance with a low-interest 10-year loan. Over that decade, the residents will pay roughly the same amount for the solar loan as they would have paid for commercial electricity distributed by Con Edison. After that, the panels are guaranteed to run for another 15 years, cranking out electricity at very low cost. 
 Having been raised in the city, I believe that apartment life is humankind's natural state, but in the course of this project I discovered, to my amazement, that not everyone thinks so. Many state and federal incentives are geared to single-family houses and simply don't work for New York co-ops. The trail of blind alleys is mapped out in detail in a report by the City University of New York's Center for Sustainable Energy. 
 Two people from the building managed to fix one of those problems. New York State gave a tax credit for 25 percent of the installation cost -- but capped it at photovoltaic systems of 10 kilowatts, not nearly enough for our array, which would be five times larger. Laura Hembree and Gene Bernstein, who serve on the building's co-op board (as do I) explained the situation to Herman D. Farrell, a Democratic Assembly member, and Dean Skelos, a Republican state senator. They sponsored legislation that changed the tax credit so it could be used by apartment houses, and Gov. Eliot Spitzer signed it into law on July 3.
 At the end of November, the panels were hoisted onto the garage roof. We will get to this stirring moment. First, though, one final lesson, that comes with a warning: this part is so boring that it turns strong people into stones. But it is the crux of how the financing works, of what makes it all possible. 
 The solar power from our roof has to be segregated from the power supplied by Con Ed. All the electricity delivered by Con Edison runs through a new master meter, and the solar power is fed separately into the building supply. The master Con Edison bill is paid by the co-op. The residents in each of the 217 apartments pay the co-op at regular retail rates for any electricity they use, whether it comes from Con Edison or from the solar panels. This provides the revenue to pay the monthly loan.
 The 266 panels form an elegantly simple jigsaw puzzle, linked to each other across the garage roof and connecting the cosmos to our refrigerators. They were nearly four years coming, and one day in arriving. That great thinker, Kermit the Frog, was right: It ain't easy being green.
 But no one had said how beautiful the panels would be, the deep indigo blue framed with a border of white stone ballast that keeps them earthbound. A blind woman in Seamus Heaney's poem ''At the Wellhead,'' tells of a revelation at the moment she realized there was something besides water in a well: ''I can see the sky at the bottom of it now.''

HEADLINE: Borrowers With Good Credit May Benefit

BYLINE: By JANE BIRNBAUM

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve's decision on Tuesday to cut interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point should offer some comfort to consumers, with limits. 
 Economists and consumer advocates agree that the biggest beneficiaries will be consumers who have both good credit and secure jobs. Those borrowers will probably be able to refinance their home mortgages at lower rates and take advantage of less expensive car loans.
 And some borrowers with adjustable-rate mortgages may also benefit because their monthly payments may not adjust upward as much. 
 But the rate cut will do little to help those whose credit scores are not stellar and are already struggling to keep up with their mortgage payments and credit card debt, experts said. 
 With rising delinquencies on many kinds of consumer loans and the prospect of growing unemployment as the economy slows, banks and other lenders ''do not want to build up a portfolio of loans to people they consider poor credit risks,'' said Dean Baker, an economist and co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research. 
 Stephen Brobeck, executive director of the Consumer Federation of America, described the Fed's rate cut as important psychologically as well as economically. ''Whether people are prepared to spend and invest sometimes depends on their confidence in the marketplace as much as in the actual resources at their disposal.'' 
 HOMES Although mortgage rates are not directly tied to the Fed funds rate, they tend to march in the same direction. The rates on fixed-rate mortgages were already coming down -- they were about 5.75 percent last week, said Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody'sEconomy.com -- and are expected to fall further now. 
 Consumers with good credit scores and fixed-rate mortgages should refinance immediately to lock in the new low rates, Mr. Zandi said. 
 ''Start shopping tomorrow,'' he said. 
 Borrowers without good credit will have a hard time refinancing, though subprime borrowers may enjoy a slightly smaller increase when interest rates reset on monthly payments, Mr. Zandi said. ''And if the Fed eases rates another half-point, it could start making a real difference in the size of those payments,'' he added. 
 Interest rates on home equity lines of credit are directly related to the Fed funds rate, so those rates will fall.
 ''On balance, the rate cut is a plus, but not huge,'' said Doug Duncan, senior vice president and chief economist of the Mortgage Bankers Association. 
 CREDIT CARDS Interest rates may dip slightly, depending on how a particular card's rate is indexed. 
 ''Your rate could go down half a percentage point, and that would translate into a national savings of about $3 to $4 billion annually,'' Mr. Brobeck said. ''But that's nothing compared to the more than some $70 billion that consumers are spending on credit card interest payments every year.'' 
 He estimated that someone with $2,000 in credit card debt would save only about $10 to $15 a year in interest. 
 CARS Rates on car loans will ''conceivably come down a little, safe to say not the full three-quarters of a point,'' said Joe Belew, president of the Consumer Bankers Association in Washington. ''It will depend on the quality of the borrower and how much volume the lender wants.''
 Mr. Baker said borrowers with good credit would see lower auto loan rates immediately. Car loans are currently slightly under 7 percent.
 SAVINGS Interest rates on savings accounts, money market funds and certificates of deposit will continue to decline, said Greg McBride, a senior financial analyst with Bankrate.com, a personal finance Web site.
 But according to Mr. Zandi, the downside for savers ''won't be too bad because banks are starved for deposits.''
 Rates on savings accounts and money market accounts may fall as much as a fifth of a percentage point in the next month and continue to drift as long as the fed funds rate stays down, he said. Interest rates for certificates of deposit, which are more competitive, will fall more slowly.

HEADLINE: A Neighbor Joins the Revival of Jamaica Avenue

BYLINE: By SANA SIWOLOP

 BODY:
The Dermot Company, a real estate developer in Manhattan, often invests in historic buildings and emerging neighborhoods. Three years ago, it took on both challenges when its development proposal to remake the old Queens Family Court building in downtown Jamaica was accepted by the New York City Economic Development Corporation. 
 There, the company had to deal with an empty 75,000-square-foot four-story municipal building, with an ornate Italian Renaissance-style facade the development corporation wanted to keep intact, but which was sloppily renovated inside and paired with a nondescript annex building in 1966. 
 Along with a parking lot, the two buildings sat on a two-acre site at Parsons Boulevard and 89th Avenue, two blocks from Jamaica Avenue.
 In 2005, a long-unfolding revival was already under way on Jamaica Avenue, but the street, a busy shopping district, was still home to a large number of discount stores and fast-food chains. 
 Dermot planned to keep the front of the courthouse and its facade, demolish the annex building and turn the rest of the site into a large mixed-use project that would be attractive to higher-quality retailers and offer low- and middle-income and market-rate housing. The company now plans to offer 346 units of housing. 
 At the time of its bid, market-rate housing was still rare in Jamaica, but the company was banking on the success of the Opal, an upscale housing project it had recently completed in Kew Gardens Hills, about a mile and a half away.
 Jamaica is a busy transportation hub and a major center for government buildings, and now the courthouse project looks especially timely.
 Local officials say residential development in the area began picking up after a terminal for the AirTrain to Kennedy International Airport opened in 2003, making the area more attractive to airport workers and travelers. The interest rose even more after the 2005 opening, a few blocks from the courthouse project, of Yorkside Towers on 161st Street, which was the first market-rate rental housing to come to the area in 30 years. 
 Last fall, the City Council approved a huge rezoning plan that limited development in certain areas of Jamaica but encouraged higher and denser development in others, like the area around the AirTrain transit hub. 
 On Jamaica Avenue, change is continuing as well. The street is scheduled to become home to a 400-seat performing arts center in the spring, and lately a growing number of banks and drugstores have joined the ranks of the mostly local businesses, which sell items like African clothing and beauty supplies.
 In 2002, a large retail center, Jamaica Center, brought a 15-screen multiplex to the avenue, as well as stores like Gap and Old Navy. Last year, meanwhile, there was the much-heralded arrival of a 47,000-square-foot Marshalls store and a Home Depot. 
 Still, local officials say downtown Jamaica can still use higher-quality retailers, as well as a supermarket, sit-down restaurants, a large electronics retailer and perhaps even a small department store.
 ''There are national retailers here, but not enough,'' said F. Carlisle Towery, president of the Greater Jamaica Development Corporation, a local nonprofit group. ''We have plenty of moms-and-pops, but we really need quality retail chains.''
 Dermot hopes its courthouse project, where development is already under way and where the costs are expected to reach $194 million, will offer the large modern retail space that many national retailers find hard to come by locally. It would also provide a more affordable home for retailers that want to be on a major road that leads to the downtown area but cannot afford Jamaica Avenue, where some rents lately have reached $150 a square foot. The company plans to ask for rents of $40 to $100 a square foot.
 Plans call for adding a 12-story residential tower to the back of the courthouse building, with an entrance along 89th Avenue.
 Shoppers, meanwhile, would enter the building through the current courthouse entrance, where a large plaza inside would be flanked by community space, as well as two large retail ''boxes'' on both sides of the plaza. The building would offer 55,000 square feet of retail space on three floors. 
 Alex Adams, the Dermot executive who is overseeing the project, said his company would like a mix of local and national retailers at the site, as well as two sit-down restaurants, which might inject more life into downtown Jamaica at night. ''We think the area is underserved in certain key areas,'' he said. 
 The project is also expected eventually to offer, in an underground garage, some 500 parking spots, ''a rarity in Jamaica,'' said Kenneth Hochhauser, a senior managing director at Newmark Knight Frank Retail, the real estate company that is marketing retail space at the site.
 ''The parking here will allow us to draw regional tenants like a Trader Joe's, Food Emporium, Red Lobster or Outback Steakhouse,'' he said, citing those companies as examples. 
 Real estate professionals say the downtown area is already reaping benefits from the new Home Depot and Marshalls. Both, they say, are in an area that used to have much less retail activity and are within 10 blocks of the courthouse project. 
 ''This is a solid eastern bookend to the downtown area that was not there before,'' said Frank Zuckerbrot, a partner at Sholom & Zuckerbrot Realty in Long Island City. 
 Howard Dolch, an executive vice president at the Lansco Corporation, which is marketing 28,500 square feet of retail space next to the new Marshalls store, said: ''This street is changing. We think we now have a much broader audience of tenants to choose from.'' 
 Still, efforts are continuing to draw even more retailers. Last fall, the city's economic development corporation began looking for a buyer for an old garage on 168th Street off Jamaica Avenue. The agency would like to see it remade into a mixed-use project combining housing with at least 35,000 square feet of retail space, which would also include space for a sit-down restaurant.

HEADLINE: Asian Markets Endure 2 Brutal Days of Plunges

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA and HEATHER TIMMONS; David Barboza reported from Shanghai and Heather Timmons from New Delhi. Keith Bradsher contributed reporting from Hong Kong and Hari Kumar from New Delhi.

DATELINE: SHANGHAI 

 BODY:
The stark sell-off that sent share prices plummeting around the world early this week brought renewed concern that the equity markets in China and India might be overvalued. But while Chinese investors and analysts worried this might be the case and fretted over the potential social consequences, in India the market chaos was often greeted as a buying opportunity. 
 The Chinese markets closed before the Federal Reserve's three-quarter-point interest rate cut on Tuesday. The Shanghai composite index had dropped 7.2 percent, to close at 4,559.75; the Shenzhen composite fell 7.7 percent; and Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng index plummeted 8.65 percent, to 21,757.63, way below its high near 32,000 in October.
 In Japan, the blue-chip Nikkei index of 225 stocks fell 9.3 percent over two days, its worst such loss in 17 years. 
 On Wednesday morning, though, some Asian markets recouped losses. The battered Hang Seng index advanced 4.5 percent in early trading and the Australian stock market, which tumbled 7.1 percent on Tuesday, its worst single-day loss in nearly two decades, was ahead 3.9 percent. Japanese and Chinese equity indexes rose, then fell back. 
 Before the embryonic rally, Kwong Man Bun, chief operating officer of KGI Asia, a big futures broker, said: ''At this stage, you can say there is panic selling in the market. We don't think the Hang Seng index has found its bottom yet; the index will continue to go down and will only find its bottom when external markets, namely the U.S. market, stabilize.''
 The major indexes in China, after reaching record highs in recent months, have plunged 15 to 30 percent.
 Jing Ulrich of JPMorgan said, ''Looking back, it must have been 10 years since I saw this kind of thing happen during the Asian financial crisis.''
 Indian markets have been on a tear for the past year -- with a few stomach-turning drops and leaps along the way. The Sensex opened at a record of 20,970 on Jan. 8, some 51 percent higher than the year before. But by Tuesday's close, it had lost 20 percent from that high. At one moment during the day, some of the biggest Indian blue-chip companies' stocks were trading down 30 percent or more. 
 Wild daily swings of several hundred points have become common in Indian markets because of a growing number of momentum investors, an influx of foreign cash and highly leveraged domestic players. While such gyrations might drive some in other markets to store their cash in the mattress, in India they seem to be whetting investors' appetites.
 Neera Mathur, 61, a homemaker in New Delhi who is investing her husband's savings, said Tuesday that her stock portfolio had lost 20 percent of its value in the recent downturn. 
 ''I'm not worried because it will come back again,'' she said. Ms. Mathur has experience on her side -- she estimates that her investments have grown 500 percent in the last 10 years. 
 In fact, she planned to invest further in stocks over the next day or two. ''The Indian economy is so robust,'' Ms. Mathur added, ''that it will overcome any impact of U.S. recession.'' 
 Her outlook is common in India, where the booming equity markets have been propelled by annual economic growth around 9 percent. 
 While China and other Asian countries rely heavily on the United States to buy their exports, most of India's growth is linked to domestic infrastructure construction and consumption.
 Strategists in India say the recent stock market plunge has more to do with one-time factors than fundamental problems. The combination of fears of an American recession, margin calls by futures and options traders and a liquidity shortage because of huge public offerings led to the downturn, said Nipun Mehta, chief executive of Unitis Tower Wealth Advisors in Mumbai.
 The appearance of the largest initial public offering in India could have contributed to the painful drops Monday and Tuesday, some investors say. The billionaire Anil Ambani sold 10 percent of his Reliance Power to the markets in a $3 billion stock issue that closed last Friday, a deal oversubscribed more than seventyfold. Indian investors seized on every bit of liquidity they could find to buy the stock, equity strategists said. 
 When the market starts to decline, there is normally enough money to encourage more purchases, but ''because of the large public offering, the money was blocked,'' said U. S. Roy, chief executive of SBI Life Insurance. 
 The Indian growth story ''has been as strong as ever, and is gaining strength with every passing month,'' he said. 
 Not everyone is so optimistic. India has recently been the ''flavor of the month'' for international investors, and domestic players have poured cash into the markets, said Abhay Aima, head of portfolio and wealth management at HDFC Bank. 
 UBS said in a report on Jan. 4 that India had replaced China as the most overvalued market in Asia. While the price of Hong Kong-listed mainland China companies had dropped since October to 28.7 times earnings from a high of 38, price-earnings ratios are at a record high of 28 times earnings in India, UBS noted, implying that cash from outside the country was artificially inflating stocks. 
 Net foreign buying in India exceeded $17 billion in 2007, UBS said, while in Asia over all, foreign investors were net sellers by $3.6 billion. 
 Chakri Lokapriya, head of India equities at BNP Paribas Asset Management UK, estimates that Indian corporate earnings will grow 22 percent in the next fiscal year, even if there is a global slowdown. 
 ''What it comes down to is there has been a certain amount of panic selling, which is unwarranted,'' Mr. Lokapriya said. ''For a long-term fund, it's a good buying opportunity.''
 In a similar vein, Ms. Ulrich of JPMorgan and other experts were not willing to say that this was the end of the bull market in China. But they sounded gloomy about the prospect of stock gains in a weakening global economy that could damp Chinese growth. 
 Indeed, some analysts hint that the Beijing government might be forced to step in and restore confidence in a market susceptible to wild swings.
 On Tuesday, Chinese officials issued no major statement about the plunge in stock prices. (Last year, they repeatedly warned investors that prices could fall sharply.) 
 A huge sell-off in the 1990s led to a nearly decade-long bear market, which persisted even after 2002, when China's economy turned red hot and new investment money poured into the country. Many angry investors even picketed government offices, saying they had been cheated out of their retirement or life savings. 
 That situation began to change only in 2006, after a series of government measures helped reignite stocks, fueling a rush to buy equities -- especially hot initial public stock offerings.
 Before long, retirees were camping out at brokerage houses, college students were quitting school to play the market and maids were calling themselves day traders. Insider trading and stock schemes multiplied, and many analysts began referring to the markets as the nation's biggest gambling den. Early in 2005, the Shanghai composite index was close to 1,000. Today, even after the recent huge sell-off, it remains above 4,500.

HEADLINE: Retreat of the Foreign Investor Is Singularly Painful for Japan

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER

DATELINE: TOKYO 

 BODY:
From buoyant optimism just two years ago, the mood among foreign investors in Japan has swung to grim pessimism. 
 An intense sense of disappointment that the country has not kept promises to open itself to the global economy, combined with a global retrenchment of investment portfolios after America's housing-loan crisis, has proved particularly destructive to Tokyo's stock markets.
 Even in the current global rout of world bourses, the size of the declines on Tokyo's stock markets stands out. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 stock index has lost a third of its value since mid-July, and the Tokyo Stock Exchange has lost $1.3 trillion in market value -- equivalent to the entire economy of Canada. By comparison, major indexes in New York, London and Frankfurt are down 13 to 16 percent since mid-July. 
 On Tuesday, the Nikkei plunged 5.7 percent, to 12,573.05, its biggest daily drop since the session after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.
 ''People are giving up on Japan,'' said Patrick Mohr, director for equity research at Nikko Citigroup in Tokyo. ''In this environment, investors want to see results. There is a perception that none of Japan's reform promises have come through.''
 Mr. Mohr and other stock analysts say one reason for the size of the sell-off here is Tokyo's heavy dependence on foreign investors. Big local institutions favor safer investments like bonds, while individuals keep more of their savings in the bank, or in overseas assets like emerging market funds. 
 In recent years, foreigners have typically accounted for more than 60 percent of trading on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the exchange says. Last summer, when global investors started pulling back, the scarcity of other buyers amplified the market declines. 
 Formidable Japanese manufacturers like Toyota, Honda and Canon -- the shares most favored by foreigners -- are all down by more than 36 percent since mid-July. 
 The battering of Japanese stocks in the subprime gale is paradoxical, because Japan, unlike other major global economies, had relatively small exposure to the American housing mess. Japanese banks have reported far smaller losses related to subprime loans than their counterparts in America and Europe, and Japan's housing market faces no similar wave of foreclosures, economists say.
 Indeed, a small number of investors say the sell-off, and the pessimism that has driven it, may have gone too far. Some investors are beginning to talk of this as a buying opportunity. They point out that Japanese companies, while less profitable than their American or European counterparts, are often cash-rich, and their strong technology makes them globally competitive. 
 They also say that companies are improving returns for shareholders, though at a slower pace than many foreign investors had hoped. Dividends are rising steadily, and are expected to reach record amounts this year.
 ''There is an unappreciated sea change here that is hard to see in the current crisis of confidence,'' said Scott Callon, chief executive of Ichigo Asset Management, a Tokyo-based investment fund. 
 Still, the near-term prospects for Japan's economy appear relatively poor. Japanese consumers, after nearly two decades of austerity, are still reluctant to spend, leaving the country dependent on exports for the bulk of its growth.
 Last month, the increasing likelihood of a downturn in the United States forced the government to cut its growth forecast for the current fiscal year, ending March 31, to 1.3 percent, from 2.1 percent. At the same time, the Bank of Japan, the central bank, issued its bleakest assessment of the economy in three years, and on Tuesday it said that growth was slowing more than expected.
 Foreign investors also cite adverse reactions to overseas funds that seek to increase the return to shareholders. John Ho, the director in Asia for the Children's Investment Fund, a British activist fund, bought a $600 million stake in Electric Power Development two years ago and has requested board seats and higher dividends. 
 He said he was fighting not just the company but also the trade ministry, which can limit foreign ownership in power companies for national security reasons. The vice trade minister, Takao Kitabata, said that his ministry would ''take needed measures'' if the Children's Fund tried to influence strategic decisions at the company, which wants to use earnings to pay down debt rather than raise dividends.
 Despite the setbacks, Mr. Ho said he believed that Japan was making progress toward heeding the interests of shareholders, albeit at a frustratingly slow pace. ''Things are changing,'' Mr. Ho said. ''It just seems sometimes that every step forward is accompanied by two steps back.''

HEADLINE: How to Stop the Downturn

BYLINE: By JOSEPH E. STIGLITZ. 
Joseph E. Stiglitz, a professor of economics at Columbia and the author, most recently, of ''Making Globalization Work,'' was awarded the Nobel in economic science in 2001.

 BODY:
AMERICA'S economy is headed for a major slowdown. Whether there is a recession (two quarters of negative growth) is less important than the fact that the economy will operate well below its potential, and unemployment will grow. The country needs a stimulus, but anything we do will add to our soaring deficit, so it is important to get as much bang for the buck as possible. The optimal package would contain one fast-acting measure along with others that could lead to increased spending if and only if the economy goes into a steep downturn. 
 We should begin by strengthening the unemployment insurance system, because money received by the unemployed would be spent immediately. 
 The federal government should also provide some assistance to states and localities, which are already beginning to feel the pinch, as property values have fallen. Typically, they respond by cutting spending, and this acts as an automatic destabilizer. Federal assistance should come in the form of support for rebuilding crucial infrastructure. 
 More federal support for state education budgets would also strengthen the economy in the short run and promote growth in the long run, as would spending to promote energy conservation and lower emissions. It may take some time to put these kinds of well-designed expenditure programs into place, but this slowdown looks as if it will last longer than some of the other downturns in recent memory. Housing prices have a long way to fall to return to more normal levels, and if Americans start saving more than they have been, consumption could remain low for some time.
 The Bush administration has long taken the view that tax cuts (especially permanent tax cuts for the rich) are the solution to every problem. This is wrong. Tax cuts in general perpetuate the excessive consumption that has marked the American economy. But middle- and lower-income Americans have been suffering for the last seven years -- median family income is lower today than it was in 2000. A tax rebate aimed at lower- and middle-income households makes sense, especially since it would be fast-acting.
 Something should be done about foreclosures, and appropriately designed legislation allowing those who have been victims of predatory lending to stay in their homes would stimulate the economy. But we should not spend too much on this. If we do, we'll wind up bailing out investors, and they are not the ones who need help from taxpayers.
 In 2001, the Bush administration used the impending recession as an excuse to cut taxes for upper-income Americans -- the very group that had done so well over the preceding quarter-century. The cuts were not intended to stimulate the economy, and they did so only to a limited extent. To keep the economy going, the Federal Reserve was forced to lower interest rates to an unprecedented extent and then look the other way as America engaged in reckless lending. The economy was sustained on borrowed money and borrowed time.
 The day of reckoning has come. This time we need a stimulus that stimulates. The question is, will the president and Congress put aside politics to get the job done?

HEADLINE: Maybe Too Little, Always Too Late

BYLINE: By BRUCE BARTLETT

 BODY:
The history of anti-recession efforts is that they are almost always initiated too late to do any good. This chart, based on recession timelines from the National Bureau of Economic Research, shows the enactment of stimulus plans is a fairly accurate indicator that we have hit the bottom of the business cycle, meaning the economy will improve even if the government does nothing. -- Bruce Bartlett, author of ''Impostor: How George W. Bush Bankrupted America and Betrayed the Reagan Legacy.''

HEADLINE: On Martha's Vineyard, Using Scallops as Currency

BYLINE: By JOAN NATHAN

DATELINE: Chilmark, Mass. 

 BODY:
 FOR year-round residents of this Martha's Vineyard village, winter is time to relax. In summer, when the island's population soars from 15,000 to 75,000, locals like Jan Buhrman have to make a year's living in just a few short months. Ms. Buhrman, who is 50, caters weddings and dinner parties for the seasonal crowd. When winter comes, she tends a local school library, among other jobs, and she cooks. 
 Even in January, her hours in the kitchen have a purpose. Sitting in the bright oak post-and-beam room built by her husband, Richard Osnoss, a carpenter, Ms. Buhrman explained that she tries to eat only food raised on Martha's Vineyard and to go down island to the grocery store in Vineyard Haven as little as possible.
 Some of her groceries she grows herself. For much of the rest, she trades with her neighbors. 
 Following Ms. Buhrman for a day or two as she gathers ingredients is a lesson in how to eat locally, even in the coldest days of winter. Because she seems to know everybody on the island who raises, catches or forages for food, it is also a glimpse of an alternative economy of eating, one in which modern capitalism takes a back seat to a looser, island-grown style of bartering.
 In summer, for instance, Ms. Buhrman hands out ice from her freezers to help the local fishermen keep their catch cold. In winter, they repay her with fish, oysters and bay scallops.
 ''It's just the way we do it here,'' she said.
 ''Swapping and borrowing isn't institutionalized on the Vineyard,'' said Carl Flanders, a fisherman in summer and a carpenter in winter. ''If I catch some fish in summer, I'll sell it to Larsen's Fish Market but I'll just give the rest away to friends. I don't expect anything in return.'' 
 Ms. Buhrman will take those bay scallops and saute them with lemons she preserved last summer. (She sold the lemons at the West Tisbury Farmer's Market, along with popovers, spice rubs and salsas.) Since Ms. Buhrman likes to cook and knows a lot of people who like to farm, she has no trouble getting food. She trades soups and stews for vegetables and lamb from her friends Mitch Posin and Clarissa Allen, who run Allen Farm in Chilmark. 
 ''I live out of Mitch's root cellar,'' Ms. Buhrman said. ''Mitch will give me a big batch of cabbage or beets. He has a big abundance of food. I don't know why he doesn't run a farm stand in summer.'' His beets will find their way into her curried beet soup, simmered with chicken or vegetable stock from her freezer and seasoned with a few spoonfuls of the curry paste she learned to make after a trip in the '80s to Southeast Asia and India. 
 Ms. Allen's 100-acre property has been in her family since 1762. It is one of more than 30 rural farms on Martha's Vineyard with a combined 8,000 acres of cultivated land. 
 ''Some of the farms are the size of a postage stamp,'' said Carlos Montoya Jr., a landscaper. ''But there are people in agriculture who have really led the way.''
 The concentration of small farms has made the island a model for eating locally in the region. ''There is a movement for food on the island and it is just embryonic on Cape Cod,'' said Gus Schumacher, former Massachusetts Commissioner of Food and Agriculture, who spends summers on the Cape. 
 ''Unlike Cape Cod, which bought farms and maintained them as costly open space as conservation land, the Vineyard fathers protected their farmers by purchasing the development rights and keeping the farmers on the land, thereby providing food throughout the summer and fall season.'' 
 Across the island, there is a determination to protect the Vineyard's rural character. Last year, when a 43-acre farm that leased land to the island's Community Sponsored Agriculture program, hundreds of summer and winter residents banded together to try to prevent it. Moved by the protest, a new buyer came forward who promised to keep the property as working farm.
 Ms. Buhrman is a staunch supporter of several groups that back agriculture on the Vineyard, like Slow Food and Island Grown Initiative, a nonprofit group. Last year she taught baking and stock-making at a fundraiser for the Farm Institute, a foundation in Edgartown that teaches young people about where food comes from. In return the institute supplied her with chicken feet for stock and livers for chopped liver. 
 In addition to the working farms, Martha's Vineyard has untold numbers of kitchen gardens. In Ms. Buhrman's, animals grow as well as vegetables. 
 For the last four years her backyard has been home to a colorful array of chickens that her son Oliver, 17, ordered over the Internet. ''By mistake we got one rooster,'' she said, watching the birds peck feed from the ground near a portable chicken house. Her younger son, Oren, 10, collects eggs each morning before going to school. 
 Outside her house live two heritage breed pigs, which she buys every year from S.B.S. Grain Store in Vineyard Haven for $65 each. Most years she sends the pigs off island to a slaughterhouse, but this year, with some workers' help, she slaughtered them in her backyard and sent some of the pork to a smokehouse in New Hampshire to be made into bacon and hams. She also makes pork sausages, and this year she is making a venison-pork sausage with ground venison given to her by Bobby Brown, a hunter in winter and caretaker in summer. 
 ''I have fatback and the expertise in making sausage, and Bob has meat that needs the fat to make the sausage,'' she said. ''So we split the final product.'' 
 Ms. Buhrman's recipe is now also being used for the sausage at Morning Glory Farm, a popular farm stand on the island. 
 Not far from Ms. Buhrman's home, her friends Rebecca Miller and Matthew Dix run a year-round vegetable stand at their North Tabor Farm, selling only eggs and honey in winter. The two purchased a six-acre lot from the town of Chilmark at an affordable price. 
 ''We had to submit a business plan giving an idea of how we would use the land as an agricultural base,'' said Mrs. Miller, 43. ''There were 10 other people who wanted it.'' In summer she sells greens, flowers and shiitake mushrooms at her stand as well as to restaurants, supermarkets, and the twice weekly farmers market in nearby West Tisbury. In the off season, she practices hypnotism and, she said, gives ''a lot of talks about buying local and supporting local agriculture.'' 
 For Caitlin Jones, who operates the seven-acre Mermaid Farm with her husband, Allen Healy, fall and winter go to saving seeds. At harvest time, she takes the best specimens of her crops and dries them. Later she will sort them into envelopes inside a house she built with a friend, a refurbished barn with a black locust tree serving as a post to hold up the beams in the center.
 ''I am a collector,'' she said one day last fall, showing off the stacks of seeds in one room. ''I cannot help it. Your plants will adapt to your bio-region and if you save the best stuff in your microclimate, then they will keep adapting for the Vineyard,'' she said. ''I am very into the taste of heirloom varieties.''
 Experimentally, Ms. Buhrman has made wheels of Camembert-style cheese with raw milk from Mermaid Farm's small herd of six cows. The leftover whey went into biscuits and ricotta cheese. She liked the results and wants to make more, so she is planning to buy her own cow. Mr. Healy and Ms. Jones offered to keep it at the farm and milk it for her if she pays for feed.
 ''I get my nourishment from people like Caitlin,'' said Ms. Buhrman. ''She and other local farmers teach me how to preserve this way of life with its hardships and joys. In the summer I can pay them whatever price they are asking because the taste of their food is so remarkable,'' she said. 
 ''You can buy heirloom tomatoes in the winter from God knows where and they don't taste anything like the ones from Caitlin's farm on Middle Road in Chilmark.''
 The contrast between summer produce at its peak and what is available off season drives Ms. Buhrman to find new ways of putting up summer fruits and vegetables. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. Once, she froze a surplus of broccoli. 
 ''It was awful. Then I tasted Birds Eye and it tasted the same,'' she said. ''I guess I just don't like frozen broccoli.''

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article last Wednesday about residents of Martha's Vineyard, Mass., who get most of their food in winter from the island's farms, omitted a description about a protest that residents mounted regarding a 43-acre farm that had been leased to the island's Community Sponsored Agriculture program. The protest was an attempt to keep the property from being sold to become a horse farm.

FED ACTS WITH BIG RATE CUT The Federal Reserve, confronted by deepening panic in global financial markets about a possible recession in the United States, struck back with the biggest one-day reduction of interest rates on record and at least temporarily stopped a vertigo-inducing plunge in share prices. 
 The Fed's dramatic move took shape Monday afternoon when the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, had apparently seen enough turmoil in overseas markets and called a meeting. [C1.] 
 A NERVE-RATTLING DAY In a dizzying somersault, the Dow Jones fell 464 points within minutes of opening as the Fed announced its rate cut, then stabilized and began rallying. The Dow closed down 128.11 points, its lowest close in 15 months. [C1.] 
 IS ASIA OVERVALUED? The global sell-off has brought renewed concern that the equity markets in China and India might be overvalued. But as Chinese investors and analysts fretted over the social consequences, in India the market chaos was greeted as a buying opportunity. [C6.] 
 Tokyo's stock markets have plunged more severely than other exchanges, reflecting disappointment that the country has not kept promises to open itself to the global economy. [C6.] 
 The European Central Bank has given no indication that it will follow the Fed. But that could change, analysts said. [C5.] 
 ROAD MAP FOR ECONOMIC PLAN The House is expected to take the lead on legislation intended to stabilize the economy, giving Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Representative John A. Boehner responsibility for making a deal with the White House. [A22.] 
 AMBAC'S 'ALTERNATIVES' The Ambac Financial Group, one of the largest companies that insures against bond losses, is exploring ''strategic alternatives'' as it announced a $3.26 billion loss in the quarter. Ambac's shares surged nearly 28 percent on the disclosure that it was in talks with ''potential parties.'' [C2.] 
 A BOON FOR SOME For consumers with good credit and safe jobs, the Fed's rate cut could mean a cheaper car loans. But the move will do little to help those struggling to keep up. [C1.] 
 Profit sinks by 95%Bank of America said net income in the fourth quarter tumbled 95 percent to $268 million, or five cents a share, from $5.26 billion, or $1.16, a year earlier. [C1.] 
 APPLE LOWERS FORECASTS Apple beat Wall Street expectations with its earnings report, but its shares fell more than 11 percent in after-hours trading as investors focused on projections for the next quarter, which were lower than expected. [C2.] 
 NO MORE PLASTIC BAGS The Whole Foods Market chain said that it would stop offering plastic grocery bags, giving customers instead a choice between recycled paper or reusable bags. [C3.] 
 NBC TO CUT BACK ON PILOTSJeff Zucker, below, the chief executive of NBC Universal, said the broadcaster was seeking to save as much as $50 million a year by reducing its reliance on pilots of new series on the NBC television channel. [C3.] 
 Hollywood's striking writers dropped a demand for extended jurisdiction over reality and animation work, and decided not to picket next month's Grammy Awards telecast. [C3.] 
 MERGING SPONSORS AND SHOWS The producers of reality shows, who are gladly stepping in to fill the programming void left by the writers' strike, are showing a greater willingness to incorporate the products of sponsors into the programs. Advertising: Stuart Elliott. [C3.] 
 A RETAILER'S HEALTH PLAN Wal-Mart said that for the first time in its 46-year history more than half its United States workers had enrolled in the company's health insurance plan. [C2.] 
 EBAY'S CHIEF IS LEAVINGMeg Whitman, chief executive of eBay for 10 years, is retiring, according to a person with knowledge of the situation. John Donahoe president of eBay's marketplaces division, is expected to succeed Ms. Whitman. [C10.]

HEADLINE: Hedge Fund Founder Sentenced for Fraud

BYLINE: By DOW JONES/AP

 BODY:
A founder of several Bayou Management hedge funds was sentenced to more than four years in prison Tuesday for a scheme to defraud investors. 
 Judge Colleen McMahon in Federal District Court in Manhattan sentenced James G. Marquez, 59, to 51 months in prison, to be followed by two years of supervised release. He also was ordered to pay nearly $6.26 million in restitution.
 ''I made the terrible choice to take the easy way out when things started going wrong at Bayou,'' Mr. Marquez said. ''My actions and inactions directly injured investors of Bayou.''
 Mr. Marquez, who left Bayou in 2001, pleaded guilty to a conspiracy charge in December 2006. 
 Prosecutors said that Mr. Marquez conspired with Samuel Israel III, Bayou's chief executive, and Daniel Marino, its chief financial officer, from 1996 to October 2001, to induce investors to contribute to funds by misrepresenting that the money-losing funds were highly profitable.
 Mr. Marquez founded the Bayou funds with Mr. Israel, the government said. Bayou Management abruptly closed its doors in July 2005.
 The fraud ballooned from more than $6 million when Mr. Marquez left the company to more than $400 million when Bayou closed its doors. In September 2005, Mr. Israel and Mr. Marino pleaded guilty to conspiracy, investment adviser fraud and other charges in connection with a scheme to defraud investors through the improper inflation of the value of Bayou's funds. They are awaiting sentencing.

HEADLINE: U.S. Given Poor Marks on the Environment

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
A new international ranking of environmental performance puts the United States at the bottom of the Group of 8 industrialized nations and 39th among the 149 countries on the list. 
 European nations dominate the top places in the ranking, which evaluates sanitation, greenhouse gas emissions, agricultural policies, air pollution and 20 other measures to formulate an overall score, with 100 the best possible. 
 The top 10 countries, with scores of 87 or better, were led by Switzerland, Sweden, Norway and Finland. The others at the top were Austria, France, Latvia, Costa Rica, Colombia and New Zealand, the leader in the 2006 version of the analysis, which is conducted by researchers at Yale and Columbia Universities. 
 ''We are putting more weight on climate change,'' said Daniel Esty, the report's lead author, who is the director of the Yale Center for Environmental Law and Policy. ''Switzerland is the most greenhouse gas efficient economy in the developed world,'' he said, in part because of its use of hydroelectric power and its transportation system, which relies more on trains than individual cars or trucks. 
 The United States, with a score of 81.0, he noted, ''is slipping down,'' both because of low scores on three different analyses of greenhouse gas emissions and a pervasive problem with smog. The country's performance on a new indicator that measures regional smog, he said, ''is at the bottom of the world right now.'' 
 He added, ''The U.S. continues to have a bottom-tier performance in greenhouse gas emissions.'' 
 The list, which is to be released Wednesday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, is the fourth, and most refined, of a series of rankings first issued in 2002. Because of methodological changes, the list this year is not directly comparable to the last one, issued in 2006, in which the United States was ranked 28th. 
 James Connaughton, chairman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality, said the problem with ozone, which is formed by chemical reactions between oxides of nitrogen, volatile organic compounds and sunlight, was being addressed by the Bush administration in new rules to curb emissions of those chemicals from power plants and from the burning of diesel fuels. 
 ''We recognized this about five years ago,'' he said. ''We have a program that in the next 10 years is going to address this in a really big way,'' with ''more than a 90 percent cut'' in diesel emissions from trucks and off-road engines like those in construction equipment. 
 The United States' low ranking in measures like the amount of carbon dioxide emissions per capita or per unit of electricity -- in the bottom 20 percent -- is not surprising, Mr. Connaughton said, because the United States contributes a quarter of the new releases of greenhouse gas emissions. 
 In recent years, he added, the United States has improved its carbon intensity -- the output of emissions relative to economic growth. In Europe and Japan, he said, ''intensity is not improving as fast, but many of these countries started in a better place.'' 
 The country's success in cleaning its air and water, he said, now allows policy makers to focus on improving carbon emissions. 
 India, China and Australia ranked among the bottom 25 nations in the indicator that combined all the climate change scores; China and Australia ranked below the United States. As with earlier versions of the index, the authors created separate lists of countries that are considered peers, either economically or geographically, and scored the performance of nations in those subgroups. 
 New Zealand and Japan led the Asian-Pacific nations, with performance scores of 88.9 and 84.5. Croatia (84.6) and Albania (84.0) led the list of Eastern European and Central Asian countries, which takes in most of the former sphere of influence of the Soviet Union, not including the Baltic nations. Mauritius (78.1), whose per capita domestic product outstrips those in the other countries of sub-Saharan Africa, led this group, just above Gabon (77.3). 
 Costa Rica (90.5), Colombia (88.3) and Canada (86.6) led the 26 countries of the Americas; Haiti (60.7) was last in this group. 
 Belgium (78.4) continued to rank near the bottom of the 28 European nations. 
 ''Belgium remains a shock,'' said Professor Esty, who said the heavily industrialized country, riven by centuries-old ethnic quarrels, was 57th among the 149 nations. ''Of those ahead of them, only 10 are richer,'' he added. 
 Christine Kim, a research associate of Professor Esty's, calculated that a country's wealth, measured as gross domestic product per capita, tended to correlate with a strong performance on such indicators as sanitation, indoor air quality and success in combating diseases -- but also with a poor performance on greenhouse gas emissions and agricultural policies.

HEADLINE: When Losing 128 Is a Relief

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ and MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM; David Jolly contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Dan MacMillan was fearing the worst on Tuesday morning. Like many Wall Street traders he expected share prices to plummet after two days of severe declines in overseas markets.
 ''I was wondering this morning if this was going to be one of those historic days you read about 20 years from now,'' said Mr. MacMillan, a trader at AG Asset Management in New York.
 As traders gathered outside the New York Stock Exchange minutes before the opening bell, a security guard captured the mood with some gallows humor. ''The market is going to crash -- that's why everyone is here, right?'' he joked. 
 But even before the Big Board opened good news came from the Federal Reserve: A surprise cut in interest rates that might check a precipitous plunge in share prices. 
 Stocks plummeted anyway, with the Dow Jones industrial average tumbling a nerve-rattling 464 points in minutes. And then, before anyone could add up all the losses, the market began to rally -- and rally and rally. Battered financial shares bolted higher. By 11 a.m., the Dow was on track to wipe out its losses but slumped again, falling 180 points. The index staged another comeback in the late afternoon, and by 3:37 p.m. was within 26 points of its close on Friday.
 By the end of the day, however, the Dow had fallen to 11,971.19, down 128.11 points, or 1.06 percent, its lowest close in 15 months. 
 The dizzying somersault left Wall Street traders and everyday investors a bit giddy that it was not worse, but still biting their nails.
 Many wondered what lies ahead now that the bull market that began in 2002 is stumbling and a recession looms. Others were just relieved to make it through a volatile day without steep losses. 
 Traders returned from a long holiday weekend on Tuesday with their nerves already frayed by a week of steep losses at home and overseas. Before the Big Board opened, stock index futures suggested the American market was headed for its steepest decline since the terrorist attacks of September 2001. 
 But help was already on the way. In Europe traders were buzzing that the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank might take coordinated action to shore up world markets. 
 That did not happen. But, about an hour before trading opened in New York, the Fed announced it was cutting its benchmark interest rate by three-quarters of a percentage point, to 3.5 percent. It was the first time the Fed cut rates between regularly scheduled policy meetings since the 2001 attacks. The European Central bank took no action. 
 When the opening bell rang on the Big Board at 9:30, stocks initially fell about 4 percent but quickly bounced back, Several times during the day the Dow almost wiped out its losses completely. 
 The rally may have been driven by investors who had previously sold short, betting the market would decline, and were now closing out those positions, said Douglas M. Peta, chief market strategist at J.& W. Seligman.
 James W. Paulsen, chief investment officer at Wells Capital Management, said the holiday on Monday gave American investors a chance to ease their fears about the foreign sell-off.
 ''I'd already been in denial, I went right through that into grief,'' he said. ''By the time I showed up today it was like, What do you mean it's only down 300? Hell, that's nothing!''
 At AG Asset Management, which overseas $2 billion, it appeared to be business as usual as the trading day wound down. Traders on the firm's Park Avenue trading floor said they had managed a few lucrative trades, and Mr. MacMillan looked relieved.
 Some individual investors, meantime, seized the chance to buy stocks on the cheap. Among them was Al Baier, the owner of tractor supply business in Wisconsin.
 Mr. Baier paid little attention to the stock market for much of the day but called his financial adviser, Bill R. Hilgedick, at the brokerage firm Edward Jones, at around 3 p.m. to find out what was going on in the market. When he heard the Dow had fallen by nearly 500 points earlier in the day, Mr. Baier jumped at the chance to buy.
 ''When it's down, you take advantage of it,'' said Mr. Baier, 61 and of Menomonie, Wis. He said he has been adding to his mutual fund holdings since the year started as stocks have fallen. He said he is eager to build up his portfolio because he only started investing in the early 1990s and he would like to buy a home in Montana.
 Specialists said the cut by the Fed and its future moves may not be enough to avert a recession. Still, they noted that it was an important first step to ease the flow of credit from banks to consumers and businesses. It will also help consumers who face resetting adjustable-rate mortgages, which are tied to short-term lending rates that are more directly influenced by the Fed's benchmark rate than the rates that apply to 30-year fixed-rate mortgages.
 The Fed ''basically told the market that the markets were in charge and they wouldn't be disappointed,'' said William H. Gross, the chief investment officer of the bond firm Pimco. 
 Typically the Fed is loath to be viewed as kowtowing to the stock market, but falling house prices and rising mortgage defaults have heightened fears that the American economy is either in a recession or headed toward one, he said.
 ''Let's face it, the U.S. consumer is dependent upon housing prices and stock prices and with both of them sinking rapidly the outlook for the economy is not good,'' Mr. Gross said.
 Investors in the futures market are now betting that the Fed will cut rates by another half a point when policy makers meet next week. Many specialists are also now speculating that the European Central Bank, where officials have been wary of cutting rates because of inflation, will also be forced to cut. 
 ''Things would be worse if the Fed hadn't cut and it would be worse if the E.C.B. doesn't cut,'' said Bernard Connolly, chief global strategist at Banque AIG in London. ''Is it enough? No. It still doesn't give the market what it wants in terms of rate cuts and there are further problems in the stock market and the real economy.''
 One mounting concern that has played a major role in the market and the thinking of policy makers is the viability of companies that guarantee trillions of dollars of municipal, mortgage and corporate bonds. These firms, led by MBIA and Ambac, have been under a cloud for much of the last year because they have insured tens of billions of dollars of securities backed by risky home mortgages, which have been defaulting at a rapid rate.
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 1.11 percent, or 14.69 points, to 1,310.50. The Nasdaq composite index declined 2.04 percent, or 47.75 points, to 2,292.27. Treasuries again rallied and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction of its price, for the 10-year note fell to 3.43 percent, from 3.63 percent on Friday evening.

HEADLINE: To Cut Costs, NBC Universal Ends Pilots

BYLINE: By ERIC PFANNER; Bill Carter contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Jeff Zucker, the chief executive of NBC Universal, said Tuesday the broadcaster was moving to save as much as $50 million a year by reducing its reliance on expensive pilots of new series on the NBC television channel. 
 The decision to eliminate most pilots was made as the company looked for ways to cut costs in response to the Hollywood writers' strike and the slowdown in the economy, Mr. Zucker said. ''It's clear we are in a recession in the United States, and we're going to have to manage our business accordingly,'' he said. 
 Networks like NBC have long relied on big-budget pilot episodes of television series in an effort to attract advertiser support for the rest of the season. But Mr. Zucker said the pilots, the first episode of a show and whose production cost has shot up to $7 million for an hour from about $3 million three years ago, were a poor indicator of the future success of a series and many never move beyond the pilot stage. 
 ''So you're spending money on programs you're not going to get,'' Mr. Zucker said. 
 He said NBC might still commission ''one or two'' pilots a season, but would not do so as a matter of course. 
 Other networks are making similar calculations. A senior executive at one of NBC's competitors said Tuesday that ''we will definitely do fewer pilots than we have before.'' This executive, who asked not to be identified because the network has yet to make its plans public, added that it had cut the number of scripts ordered for next season in half.
 Mr. Zucker acknowledged that one reason for the decision was that NBC has suffered from weak prime-time ratings for the last several seasons. ''Sometimes you see the world from a different perspective when you're flat on your back,'' he said. ''At NBC Entertainment we've been flat on our backs for the last few years.'' 
 Mr. Zucker was in London during a stop on the way to the World Economic Forum annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland. He addressed NBC Universal's 16,000 worldwide employees in a ''town hall'' videoconference -- the first time, he said, that the company had conducted such a meeting from London. 
 NBC Universal, which is 80 percent owned by General Electric, with 20 percent held by Vivendi of France, has been trying to build up its international arm, with Mr. Zucker setting a goal of increasing its revenue from outside the United States to $5 billion in 2010 from $2.8 billion in 2006.
 The company also said Tuesday that it had agreed to purchase a 26 percent stake in a unit of New Delhi Television of India that owns several entertainment channels aimed at the Indian market. The investment, valued at $150 million, comes after several other international expansion moves last year by NBC Universal.

HEADLINE: Apple Beats Forecast, but Shares Tumble Anyway

BYLINE: By LAURA M. HOLSON

 BODY:
Apple beat Wall Street expectations with its earnings report Tuesday, but its shares fell more than 11 percent in after-hours trading as investors fretted over its prospects.
 Apple earned $1.58 billion, or $1.76 for each diluted share, in the first quarter of fiscal 2008, compared with $1 billion, or $1.14 a share, in the period a year earlier. Revenue was $9.6 billion, up from $7.1 billion. 
 But while Apple executives paraded those as record-setting figures, investors focused on projections for the next quarter, which were lower than what analysts had expected. Apple said it expected revenue of about $6.8 billion for the second quarter, or diluted earnings of 94 cents a share. Wall Street was forecasting profit of $1.09 a share on revenue of $7 billion. 
 Peter Oppenheimer, Apple's chief financial officer, gave two reasons for the lower forecast: a decline in software sales and the normal slowdown in business after Christmas. 
 When asked whether the lumbering economy could be a factor in Apple's earnings outlook, Mr. Oppenheimer said: ''We'll leave the economic forecasting to others.'' Instead, he said, ''our focus is on managing our business.''
 A slowdown in the economy is likely to hurt technology companies like Apple, which are dependent on consumers shelling out hundreds of dollars for their products. Just last week, Sprint Nextel announced that it was losing customers more quickly than expected, raising fears that spending on cellphones and other devices was slowing across the industry. Intel was also cautious about its financial outlook last week, in part because of concerns about a recession.
 A. M. Sacconaghi Jr., a senior analyst at Bernstein Research, said one reason for concern about Apple was that domestic sales of the iPod were less robust than the company had expected. 
 Indeed, Mr. Oppenheimer of Apple said that sales of the iPod in the United States were little changed in the quarter, although iPod sales abroad were quite strong. (Over all, Apple saw a 5 percent increase in iPod sales in the first quarter compared with the period a year earlier.) 
 What is worrisome, Mr. Sacconaghi said, is whether the flat domestic iPod sales are a harbinger of things to come for other Apple products. 
 ''That's the big question,'' he said. ''If they feel it here, could they feel it in other products and other parts of the world?''
 Apple shares fell $5.72, or 3.5 percent, to close at $155.64. They were down more than $17 in after-hours trading. 
 The iPhone remained a bright spot for the company. Apple sold 2.3 million in the quarter, according to Mr. Oppenheimer, and is on track to sell 10 million in 2008, as projected.
 Apple shipped 2.3 million Macintosh computers, and revenue from Macs grew 47 percent from the year-ago quarter.
 Mr. Sacconaghi said sales of Mac computers could start showing lower year-over-year growth. IPod sales could suffer, he said, because the company has been slow to update its cheaper iPod models, and holiday sales of MP3 players at the retailer Best Buy were down.
 At the Macworld Expo last week, Steven P. Jobs, Apple's chief executive, made several announcements about new products or expanded services, including a new ultralight computer called the MacBook Air that, while elegant, has limited memory. Mr. Jobs also announced a deal with all of Hollywood's major studios to allow digital movie rentals through the iTunes Store.

HEADLINE: United Narrows Its Loss Despite High Fuel Costs

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
CHICAGO -- The UAL Corporation, the parent of United Airlines, reported a quarterly loss on Tuesday, caused by fuel costs and economic weakness in the industry.
 The loss was narrower than a year ago, when UAL was badly hurt by winter storms, and it beat Wall Street's forecast. UAL's revenue rose almost 13 percent, helped by a one-time gain from its mileage program. 
 The airline's results underscore the industry's fight against record fuel prices, but also reflect the advantages of restraining supply to bolster revenue.
 An analyst at Calyon Securities, Ray Neidl, said that United had a significant increase in its passenger revenue per available seat mile.
 ''They looked like they were in a little bit stronger position than we thought they would be,'' Mr. Neidl said.
 The airline industry hopes to build on a recovery that began in 2006 when carriers began cutting capacity -- the number of seats -- on domestic routes and increasing capacity on more profitable international routes.
 Last week, UAL's chief rival, the AMR Corporation, which is the parent of American Airlines, reported a fourth-quarter loss. . 
 United said its fourth-quarter loss amounted to $53 million, or 47 cents a share, compared with a loss of $61 million, or 55 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts had expected the company to lose 96 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates.
 United said quarterly revenue was $5.03 billion, a 9.7 percent increase over the period a year ago.
 UAL's fuel bill rose 25.7 percent in the quarter to $1.43 billion. The company said its mainline costs, excluding fuel and special items, increased 9.2 percent. The company ended the quarter with an unrestricted cash and short-term investments balance of $3.6 billion.
 UAL said it would make a special distribution of $2.15 a share to common stockholders. The payment to stockholders will be about $250 million, including $20 million to employee shareholders.

HEADLINE: Worries That the Good Times Were a Mirage

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
E-mail: leonhardt@nytimes.com

 BODY:
So, how bad could this get?
 Until a few months ago, it was accepted wisdom that the American economy functioned far more smoothly than in the past. Economic expansions lasted longer, and recessions were both shorter and milder. Inflation had been tamed. The spreading of financial risk, across institutions and around the world, had reduced the odds of a crisis. 
 Back in 2004, Ben Bernanke, then a Federal Reserve governor, borrowed a phrase from an academic research paper to give these happy developments a name: ''the great moderation.'' 
 These days, though, the great moderation isn't looking quite so great -- or so moderate.
 The recent financial turmoil has many causes, but they are tied to a basic fear that some of the economic successes of the last generation may yet turn out to be a mirage. That helps explain why problems in the American subprime mortgage market could have spread so quickly through the world's financial system. On Tuesday, Mr. Bernanke, who is now the Fed chairman, presided over the steepest one-day interest rate cut in the central bank's history. 
 The great moderation now seems to have depended -- in part -- on a huge speculative bubble, first in stocks and then real estate, that hid the economy's rough edges. Everyone from first-time home buyers to Wall Street chief executives made bets they did not fully understand, and then spent money as if those bets couldn't go bad. For the past 16 years, American consumers have increased their overall spending every single quarter, which is almost twice as long as any previous streak. 
 Now, some worry, comes the payback. Martin Feldstein, the eminence grise of Republican economists, says he is concerned that the economy ''could slip into a recession and that the recession could be a long, deep, severe one.'' In Monday's Democratic presidential debate, Barack Obama made the same argument: ''We could be sliding into an extraordinary recession,'' he said. 
 In the next breath, of course, Mr. Obama suggested that the right policies might still help, while Mr. Feldstein has said that a recession isn't yet a sure thing. And much of the great moderation is real. Computers allow managers to run their businesses more efficiently and avoid some of the wild swings. The Fed and central banks in other countries have learned from their past mistakes. 
 But a recession is now more likely than not. It may well have started already. The Philadelphia Fed reported Tuesday that the economy shrunk in 23 states last month, including Ohio, Missouri and Arizona, and was stagnant in seven others. California and Florida, with their plunging home values, may soon join the recession list.
 The bigger question is how severe the recession will be if it does come to pass. The last two, in 1990-1 and 2001, have been rather mild, which is a crucial part of the great moderation mystique. There are three reasons, though, to think the next recession may not be.
 First, Wall Street hasn't yet come clean. Even after last week, when JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo announced big losses in their consumer credit businesses, financial service firms have still probably gone public with less than half of their mortgage-related losses, according to Moody'sEconomy.com. They're not being dishonest; they just haven't untangled all of their complex investments. 
 ''Part of the big uncertainty,'' Raghuram G. Rajan, former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, said, ''is where the bodies are buried.'' 
 As Mr. Rajan pointed out, this situation is more severe than the crisis involving Long Term Capital Management in the late 1990s. That was a case in which a limited set of bad investments, largely at one firm, had the potential to drive down the value of other firms' holdings in the short term. Those firms then might have stopped lending money because they no longer had the capital to do so. But their own balance sheets were largely healthy. 
 This time, the firms are facing real losses, which will almost certainly curtail lending, and economic growth, this year. 
 The second problem is that real estate and stocks remain fairly expensive. This shows just how big the bubbles were: despite the recent declines, stock prices and home values have still not returned to historical norms. 
 David Rosenberg, a Merrill Lynch economist, says that the stock market is overvalued by 10 percent relative to corporate earnings and interest rates. And remember that stocks usually fall more than they should during a bear market, much as they rise more than they should during a bull market.
 The situation with house prices looks worse. Until 2000, the relationship between house prices and rents remained fairly steady. The same could be said about house prices relative to household incomes and mortgage rates. But the boom of the last decade changed this entirely.
 For prices to return to the old norm, they would still need to fall 30 percent across much of Florida, California and the Southwest and about 20 percent in the Northeast. This could happen quickly, or prices could remain stagnant for years while incomes and rents caught up.
 Cheaper stocks and houses will benefit many people -- namely those who don't yet own a home and still have most of their 401(k) investing in front of them. But the price declines will also lead directly to the third big economic problem.
 Consumer spending kept on rising for the last 16 years largely because families tapped into their newfound wealth, often taking out loans to supplement their income. This increase in debt -- as a recent study co-written by the vice chairman of the Fed dryly put it -- ''is not likely to be repeated.'' So just as rising asset values cushioned the last two downturns, falling values could aggravate the next one. 
 ''What people have done is make an assumption that these prices could continue rising at the rate they had been,'' said Ed McKelvey, an economist at Goldman Sachs. ''And that does seem to have been an unreasonable assumption.''
 Certainly, there are some forces to push in the other direction. Outside of Wall Street, corporate balance sheets remain remarkably strong, while the recent fall in the dollar will help American companies to sell more goods overseas. 
 But it's hard not to believe that the economy will pay a price for the speculative binge of the last two decades, either by going through a tough recession or an extended period of disappointing growth. As is already happening, banks will become less willing to lend money, households will become less willing to spend money they don't have and investors will become more alert to risk.
 Welcome to the new moderation.

HEADLINE: Huckabee, Short on Cash, Curtails Effort in Florida

BYLINE: By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK; Brenda Goodman contributed reporting from Atlanta, and Michael Luo from New York.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Before he won the Iowa Republican caucuses, Mike Huckabee told voters that sending him to victory would forever debunk the conventional wisdom that money could decide a presidential race.
 On Tuesday, though, the Huckabee campaign acknowledged that its chronic shortage of money might be catching up to it.
 As the Republican front-runners crisscross Florida -- the race's biggest prize yet and a state his campaign once considered essential -- Mr. Huckabee is pulling back in the state. He told reporters that he did not plan to advertise in Florida, and his only campaign stops scheduled so far this week were token events at airports. To conserve cash, Ed Rollins, his top consultant, and a few other staff members have agreed to work without pay, and his campaign has stopped arranging transportation for the traveling press. 
 If there were a prize for votes-per-dollar, Mr. Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas, could have easily captured it. He won the Iowa caucuses, finished third in New Hampshire and in Michigan, and narrowly lost in South Carolina after raising less than one-tenth of the money amassed by each of his three leading rivals.
 Now Mr. Huckabee's campaign risks ending up the first casualty of two changes in the 2008 political landscape: a compressed primary schedule that forces candidates to be ready to compete across the country right away and the decline of the public financing system that used to limit what a candidate could spend in the primary season. All of the Republicans and all but one of the Democrats opted to raise and spend private money rather than accept the limitations of the system.
 Mr. Huckabee's financial troubles may be a boon to former Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts as he competes with Senator John McCain of Arizona and Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York mayor. 
 Mr. Romney had initially planned to present himself as the social conservatives' standard bearer, taking strong stands against abortion rights, embryonic stem-cell research and same-sex marriage. But Mr. Huckabee, a Southern Baptist minister, derailed those plans by rallying evangelical Christians with a novel message of conservatism on social issues and populism on economic ones. He also capitalized on evangelical suspicions about Mr. Romney's past statements on issues and about his Mormon faith.
 Mr. Huckabee spoke Tuesday at an Atlanta rally against abortion rights and said afterward that he had not given up on Florida. ''I'll be doing a lot of shuttling,'' he said. ''We've obviously got to be in Florida, and we'll be there every day, but we won't be neglecting Georgia and many of the other states as well.''
 Alice Stewart, his press secretary, said that Mr. Huckabee planned a full schedule of rallies and church services in Florida next weekend, and that his campaign had $2 million in cash on hand. ''We have got plenty of money,'' she said. ''We have gotten this far with a lean staff, and we will continue to move forward with a lean staff.''
 Still, $2 million is a small fraction of the money available to Mr. Romney, Mr. McCain and Mr. Giuliani. Ms. Stewart acknowledged that Mr. Huckabee's shoestring campaign was laying off some staff members, saying, ''Some of the staff whose focus was Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, their job was done.''
 Unlike his rivals, Mr. Huckabee never had enough money to send advance teams to plan events or drum up crowds. He could not afford polls, big-name political consultants or a staff of policy advisers. 
 He won in Iowa by relying on his quick wit, oratorical skills and as many talk-show appearances as he could schedule. He traveled with the actor Chuck Norris and played the bass guitar with local rock bands to help attract crowds. But his Iowa victory did not bring in as much new money as he had hoped, his advisers said. He increased his spending in South Carolina, and his loss there slowed his Iowa momentum.
 His Iowa victory evoked comparisons with former President Jimmy Carter, another evangelical dark horse with little campaign cash who surprised the field in 1976 with an Iowa caucus victory. But back then the federal financing system and its spending limits leveled the playing field. Mr. Carter had weeks to build on his Iowa victory before the New Hampshire primary, a few more weeks before the next contest in Florida and a slow build until April. This year, in contrast, more than 20 states have their nominating contests within five weeks.
 Speaking to reporters Monday night on a flight to Atlanta, Mr. Huckabee vowed to fight on. But he also acknowledged the possibility that he might need to plan for a defeat, according to The Associated Press.
 ''If the campaign doesn't make it all the way, we want to walk away completely in the black,'' Mr. Huckabee said.

HEADLINE: Anxiety Crashes the Party at Davos

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: DAVOS, Switzerland 

 BODY:
There was George Soros hunched over a dinner table, deep in conversation with a nodding companion. Howard Stringer of Sony ran into Mickey Schulhof, who once ran Sony's American arm. And Klaus Schwab, the impresario of the World Economic Forum, welcomed an A-list crowd to a twinkling ballroom at the Hotel Belvedere. 
 It seemed like just another meeting of the world's most exclusive talk shop, held each January in this Alpine ski resort. The trouble is nobody was talking about anything but the global market turmoil and the faltering American economy. 
 This year, the World Economic Forum is actually going to be about the world economy. 
 Which is not to say that there won't be fun. The guys from Google, Sergey Brin and Larry Page, will play host to a dance party, featuring Norman Jay, a British disc jockey who spins funk, soul and house music. It is likely to be the biggest hit of the conference. 
 But on Tuesday afternoon, high anxiety had already taken hold, even before the movers and shakers from business, politics and nonprofits made their way to Davos. 
 ''The Fed cuts rates by 75 basis points, and still the market drops. Incredible,'' said Nouriel Roubini, an economist, staring at his BlackBerry. He showed a chart with a downward spiraling stock market to his associates. 
 On Wednesday, Mr. Roubini, who is known for dark views even in good times, is expected to appear on a panel about the global economy. In the wake of the stock market's ferment and the emergency action by the Federal Reserve on Tuesday, his pessimism is likely to find a receptive audience. 
 ''The mood will be more subdued this year,'' Mr. Schwab said in an interview, ''but I hope not pessimistic.''
 Like a party host nervously refilling the punch bowl, though, Mr. Schwab can do only so much to improve the mood. 
 A Gallup poll of 61,000 people in 60 countries, taken for the forum, shows that those responding are more worried than last year about security and the economy.
 The organizers said only 13 invitees had pulled out of the conference on Tuesday, a typical rate in a given year. But Secretary of the Treasury Henry M. Paulson Jr. canceled last week, citing the press of business at home, as did the prime minister of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdogan. 
 The president of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, was sticking to a plan to come on Thursday afternoon. But his spokeswoman noted, ''We have canceled things in the past.'' 
 People here predicted that immediate concerns about the economy might crowd out the official agenda, which as usual is devoted to high-minded concerns, humanistic as well as economic. 
 ''The chief executives are going to be running crisis sessions from their hotel suites,'' a public relations executive said, asking that his name not be used because he did not want to upset Mr. Schwab. 
 Nonetheless, Bill Gates of Microsoft, the quintessential Davos Man, is expected to ask questions that go beyond the current turmoil in the stock market. Mr. Gates, a regular and ordinarily upbeat participant in these meetings, plans to deliver a potentially provocative speech titled ''A New Approach to Capitalism in the 21st Century.''
 A spokesman for Microsoft was cagey about the details. But people involved in Mr. Gates's appearance said he would take business and government to task for what he views as their inadequate response to the twin scourges of disease and poverty in the developing world.
 Mr. Gates plans to step away from day-to-day operations at Microsoft this summer to devote his time to the Gates Foundation, which is pouring billions of dollars into AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria research. His speech is intended to be a call to arms, people with knowledge of it said.
 Mr. Schwab will break his rule of not giving any speaker more than 15 minutes, allowing Mr. Gates half an hour. The theme is close to Mr. Schwab's heart; he questions corporate behavior in an article in the current issue of Foreign Affairs magazine.
 ''It's not that the pendulum is now swinging back to Marxist socialism,'' he said in the interview, ''but people are asking themselves, 'What are the boundaries of the capitalist system?' They think that the market may not always be the best mechanism for providing solutions.''
 The role of banks in fueling the subprime-lending crisis, which has mutated into a broader trans-Atlantic credit crisis, spurring a lack of confidence in global markets, is likely to raise questions about the need for better regulation of the worldwide financial system.
 Davos, a Swiss enclave, has long been a place where the sick go to be cured. Thomas Mann set ''The Magic Mountain'' in a sanatorium here. Tuberculosis patients used to come for the peace and quiet. 
 But in the next five days, the turmoil of the outside world can be expected to invade this sanctuary, adding a sense of urgency.
 This year's token celebrity guest, for instance, the British actress Emma Thompson, has criticized corporations for how they market products to children. Ms. Thompson has campaigned regularly on behalf of refugees.
 ''One question is how much priority we give to political issues versus economic issues,'' Mr. Schwab said. ''This year, economic issues will be at the forefront compared to political issues.''
 Organizers expect one of the most sought-after sessions to be the session on the growing financial muscle of sovereign wealth funds, a subject that did not figure on the Davos agenda until this year. Lawrence H. Summers, former Treasury secretary, will take part in the panel, along with the managing director of the Kuwait Investment Authority, Bader al-Saad; Norway's finance minister, Kristin Halvorsen; and others who manage hundreds of billions of dollars.
 While there will be 27 heads of state and government on hand, they will be outnumbered by 74 chief executives from the largest companies. Among the bold-faced names will be James Dimon of JPMorgan Chase, Wang Jianzhou of China Mobile, Indra K. Nooyi of PepsiCo, Rupert Murdoch of the News Corporation and Lakshmi N. Mittal of ArcelorMittal.
 Davos regulars will turn up. Bono, the rock statesman, is to appear with Al Gore, the former vice president and Nobel laureate, on a panel modestly titled, ''A Unified Earth Theory: Combining Solutions to Extreme Poverty and the Climate Crisis.''
 Tony Blair, a reliable visitor when he led Britain, will compete for airtime with his successor, Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who is also scheduled to attend. Mr. Blair is a co-chairman of the meeting and has joined the board of the Forum, prompting speculation that he might someday succeed Mr. Schwab, who turns 70 this year.
 Mr. Schwab still nurses grand ambitions for Davos and its role in world affairs. While Mr. Paulson canceled, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice is scheduled to speak about terrorism and climate change.
 For the first time in three years, Mr. Schwab has invited a senior government official from Iran, Manouchehr Mottaki, the foreign minister. Pervez Musharraf, the Pakistani president, will also be here.
 Competing with the Google guys for the title of richest party hosts will be the oil producer Bahrain. The Persian Gulf state is sending a large delegation, including its crown prince, Sheik Salman bin Hamad al-Khalifa, and the heads of several companies. They will play host at a reception and an art exhibit.
 Global anxiety still doesn't mean that you can't party.

HEADLINE: Missouri Governor Will Not Seek 2nd Term

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY; Catrin Einhorn contributed reporting.

DATELINE: CHICAGO 

 BODY:
Matt Blunt, the governor of Missouri and a Republican, announced late Tuesday that he would not seek re-election this fall, a decision that stunned many in the state's political circles and threw the anticipated alignment of Missouri's election into disarray. 
 Mr. Blunt, who had been widely expected to seek a second term, released a video address in which, seated beside his wife, Melanie, he told state residents that he had completed his promised agenda for the state. 
 ''The habit of politicians is to remain in office and the desire to prove oneself in the next election is strong,'' Mr. Blunt said. ''After a great deal of thought and prayer, and with the knowledge that we have achieved virtually everything I set out to accomplish, and more, I will not seek a second term in the upcoming election. Because I feel we have changed what I wanted to change in the first term there is not the same sense of mission for a second.''
 Mr. Blunt had been expected to face a difficult re-election bid, appearing headed for a battle with Jay Nixon, a Democrat, the state's attorney general. Before Tuesday, the showdown between the two seemed to have already begun: both were aggressively raising money and regularly clashing publicly on state issues. Mr. Blunt's announcement leaves the Republican Party with no certain nominee in the race. 
 ''His approval ratings had been weak and there had been several open sores within his administration,'' said Dave Robertson, a professor of political science at the University of Missouri, St. Louis. ''The combination of that and the economic outlook that has really deteriorated in just a few weeks -- any incumbent governor is going to have a very difficult time dealing with that.''
 Mr. Nixon, in a statement released late Tuesday, wished Mr. Blunt well. 
 ''I will continue to focus on changing the direction of our state so that more Missourians have access to health care, more Missourians can find good-paying jobs and more Missouri children can get the quality education they deserve,'' Mr. Nixon said.
 Mr. Blunt, 37, had been among the state's youngest governors when he was elected and had been expected by many to pursue a long political career in the state; the son of Representative Roy Blunt, he came from a family of political leaders. 
 The governor has taken credit for repairing the state's Medicaid program and balancing the state budget, but he has also wrestled with several problems, including what Mr. Robertson described as a mini-scandal. 
 A former state lawyer, Scott Eckersley, has filed a lawsuit against the governor's office that involves the destruction of official e-mail messages. Mr. Eckersley says he was fired after he pointed out that the destruction of the messages violated the state's open records laws.

HEADLINE: Spitzer Plans Cuts and Fees To Close Deficit Of $4.4 Billion

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM; Trymaine Lee contributed reporting.

DATELINE: ALBANY 

 BODY:
Gov. Eliot Spitzer on Tuesday proposed an array of taxes and fees and almost $1 billion in health care cuts, and scaled back plans for new education aid and property tax relief, in an effort to close a budget deficit estimated at $4.4 billion.
 The governor's $124.3 billion budget plan also called for an expansion of gambling to raise $250 million by installing thousands of video slot machines at Belmont Park.
 The governor's budget was unveiled as the Federal Reserve cut interest rates significantly to address increasingly gloomy economic fears in the United States, which sent global markets plummeting this week. 
 Still, Mr. Spitzer's plan for the fiscal year, which begins April 1, calls for a spending increase of 5 percent and the expansion of the state government work force by nearly 1 percent, bringing the number of workers to more than 200,000. 
 Some independent budget analysts said that the governor was not acting swiftly enough to curb spending, given the nation's worsening economic conditions, and that his budget assumed there would not be a recession. 
 With the markets hemorrhaging even as he spoke Tuesday afternoon, Mr. Spitzer did not rule out taking the unusual step of making further cuts later this year. 
 ''Uncertainty necessarily dictates that one consider that possibility,'' the governor said, adding: ''The Fed last night, by the three-quarter-point cut in interest rates, demonstrated that it is dedicated to moving us forward quickly. The president, Congress are all moving us in a direction of economic stimulus, and so let's hope for the best and maintain, nonetheless, our options.''
 Elizabeth Lynam, deputy research director of the Citizens Budget Commission, a watchdog group, said, ''Things were changing as the ink was drying in what they were presenting, and I think they recognize that.''
 ''It's likely to get worse, and they'll have to start talking about what else should go,'' she added. 
 Republicans moved quickly to criticize the governor's tax plans. Among items likely to be contested are $738 million in proposed new taxes and fees, and Mr. Spitzer's plan to scale back the school property tax program, which returns money to homeowners to offset property taxes. 
 He also called for a significant expansion of gambling, by allowing thousands of video gambling machines at Belmont racetrack in addition to thousands planned for Aqueduct. And earlier this month he proposed leasing a stake in New York's lottery system to a private operator to pay for a new $4 billion endowment for the State University of New York.
 Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, the Legislature's top Democrat, said he was ''generally pleased'' with the governor's budget but concerned about the gambling proposals. 
 ''Working men and women have a hard enough time making ends meet,'' he said in a statement. ''Their government should not be tempting them to play with their limited resources.''
 The governor insisted that he was not raising taxes, and in fact he proposed no broad income tax increase. But he did propose tax increases on gasoline and malt liquor, among other products, and a new tax on illegal drugs -- including $3.50 per gram of marijuana and $200 a gram for other drugs. Some other states are already assessing such a fee in the course of drug prosecutions. In New York, it is expected to bring in $13 million a year. 
 Mr. Spitzer also proposed reclassifying health maintenance organizations so they are taxed as insurers, a change that would bring in more than $200 million a year. And he proposed increasing by $50 million other fees charged to health insurance companies, as well as steps aimed at increasing taxes paid by out-of-state residents who work or do business in New York.
 Fees likely to have a broad effect include his plan to increase the real estate transfer tax, which is paid as part of closing costs for home purchases above $175,000 and an increase in the surcharge on every auto insurance policy issued in the state. He also proposed ending the income tax credit for New York City households with income of $250,000 or more. 
 The governor called for an array of cuts in state aid to New York City, including $160 million in operating aid, $30 million in welfare grants and $20 million for juvenile detention. 
 ''Like every other state in the nation, New York is feeling the effects of a serious economic downturn, requiring us to make tough decisions necessary to continue moving our state in the right direction,'' the governor wrote in a message included with his budget presentation. 
 The Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, the state's top Republican, said the governor ''has repeatedly promised, among other things, not to raise taxes, to provide relief for property-tax payers, to help the upstate economy and boost higher education. The budget he delivered today, unfortunately, did not deliver on these promises.'' 
 Edmund J. McMahon, director of the Empire Center for New York State Policy, a conservative group, said: ''I don't think 5 to 6 percent growth qualifies as an austere response. It doesn't qualify as belt tightening; it's more like throat clearing.'' 
 ''Spending is still increasing at an unsustainable level. We're dealing with it one year at a time and hoping for the best in the future,'' he added.
 The $124.3 billion budget, including federal matching funds, would increase spending at about twice the rate of inflation projected by the state. The governor is proposing $980 million cuts in Medicaid and other health care, in part by changing the way the state reimburses hospitals and other providers to emphasize preventive care, and in part by changing the way the state makes bulk purchases of pharmaceuticals. 
 The Spitzer administration is also seeking to reap $1.35 billion in savings by ordering executive agencies to pare 5 percent from their budgets, by closing some facilities and by taking steps to lower energy use. 
 The governor proposed a $1.46 billion increase in education aid, bringing total education spending to $21 billion. That plan is scaled back from what he had outlined last year; New York City schools are likely to see a $100 million reduction in the operating aid they had been promised, although it would be more than they received last year. 
 Aid set aside by Senate Republicans for Long Island would also be reduced in the plan, a move sure to cause a legislative fight. 
 ''He distorts the distribution of school aid,'' Mr. Bruno said. 
 Republicans in the Senate particularly objected to proposed cutbacks in the school tax relief, which modestly offsets homeowners' property taxes. The state had committed to return $5.3 billion to property taxpayers this year; that will be scaled back to $5 billion. 
 The Legislature will spend the next several weeks conducting hearings on the governor's proposals before preparing their own spending plan; lawmakers then negotiate with the governor to reach a budget deal by March 31.
 Hospitals and labor unions reacted warily on Tuesday. 
 In a statement, the Greater New York Hospital Association and 1199 United Healthcare Workers East said they were ''troubled by the enormous ambiguity surrounding the financial impact on New York hospitals'' of proposals in the budget. 
 Assemblyman Michael N. Gianaris, a Queens Democrat, said: ''Everyone recognizes this is a very difficult year budget-wise.
 ''While there will definitely be interest groups kicking and screaming about their particular subject areas, the important thing to recognize is there are difficult choices to be made and the governor has struck a good balance.''

HEADLINE: FED, IN SURPRISE, SETS BIG RATE CUT TO EASE MARKETS

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS; Steven R. Weisman and Carl Hulse contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve, confronted by deepening panic in global financial markets about a possible recession in the United States, struck back on Tuesday morning with the biggest one-day reduction of interest rates on record and at least temporarily stopped a vertigo-inducing plunge in stock prices.
 The unexpected decision came after a rare, hastily called policy meeting by videoconference on Monday evening, and it reduced the Fed's benchmark overnight lending rate by three-quarters of a percentage point, to 3.5 percent.
 The Fed's move was prompted in part by turmoil in global markets on Monday, a holiday in the United States. Shortly after lunch that day, the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, canceled a planned trip to New York and started organizing the impromptu meeting of the Fed officials who decide interest rate policy. The Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., watching the same market turmoil, was anxious enough that he called President Bush at the White House. 
 In a statement accompanying the Fed's decision, which was announced about an hour before the stock market opened for trading, officials hinted that they might reduce rates yet again at their scheduled meeting next Tuesday and Wednesday. 
 The magnitude of the Fed's rate cut helped reverse what began as a horrendous day in the stock markets. European and Asian stock prices had already plunged for the second consecutive day, and the Dow Jones industrial average fell 464 points -- about 5 percent -- as soon as markets opened in New York.
 By the close of trading Tuesday, stock prices, after gyrating wildly, had clawed much of their way back. Shares of banks and insurers of mortgage-backed securities, which had been battered in recent days, were among the day's biggest gainers. Asian markets seemed to calm Wednesday morning with most exchanges opening higher.
 ''Wall Street is incredibly jittery,'' said Len Blum, a partner at Westwood Capital, an investment bank in New York. ''They don't know how to react to it. The last time they did a rate cut in between meetings was after Sept. 11, 2001.''
 The Fed's move came as Mr. Bush and Congressional leaders pledged to work together on a bipartisan measure to jolt the economy with about $145 billion in tax rebates, tax breaks for businesses and possibly additional payments to low-income people. 
 ''I believe we can find common ground to get something done that's big enough and effective enough,'' Mr. Bush told reporters. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Senate majority leader, said he hoped Congress could pass a bill before the recess for Washington's Birthday on Feb. 18.
 Still, it was a nerve-racking day on Wall Street, with the Dow ending down 128 points, or about 1 percent. Even after the rebound, the major market indexes are down about 10 percent so far in January and even further off their recent highs in October. The Nasdaq composite index, which mostly reflects technology stocks, is off 18.3 percent. 
 Economists said it remained far from clear that the United States would avoid a recession, either because the Fed and the Bush administration had moved too slowly or because the economy's woes were too acute to solve quickly and painlessly. 
 ''This is unique in the modern history of the Fed,'' said Vincent Reinhart, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute who was director of the Fed's division of monetary affairs from 2001 to 2007. 
 Even so, it may not be enough to head off a downturn: changes in interest rates usually work with a lag time of at least six to nine months, and many economists say that a recession may already have begun.
 Citigroup, citing the severely depressed housing market, the credit squeeze and high energy prices, predicted on Tuesday that the economy was about to start shrinking and would barely eke out any growth for all of 2008.
 ''Academic definitions aside, we'll call that a recession,'' wrote Steven Wieting, a Citigroup economist.
 Fed officials stopped well short of such gloom and doom, but they made it clear they had been alarmed by both worsening data in the United States and the worldwide stock panic that began on Monday.
 ''Broader financial market conditions have continued to deteriorate,'' the central bank said, noting that credit conditions have continued to tighten for many businesses and households, that the housing market continues to spiral downward and that job creation has slowed. 
 ''Appreciable downside risks to growth remain,'' the central bank said, its most forceful acknowledgment yet that the United States economy is on the brink of a recession as a result of the triple punch from the severe downturn in housing, the fallout from soured mortgages and the added blow of high oil prices.
 The move represented a dramatic shift for Mr. Bernanke, who took over as Fed chairman two years ago. Mr. Bernanke, a former professor of economics at Princeton, had resisted calls for a big rescue effort by the Fed and favored a less personalized approach to monetary policy than his predecessor, Alan Greenspan.
 But when Mr. Bernanke called policy makers together for an emergency meeting on Monday night, with regional Fed presidents participating over secure videoconference lines, he embarked on the boldest policy move in years. 
 This was only the fifth time that the Federal Reserve had reduced the overnight federal funds rate outside of its regularly scheduled policy meetings. It did so in October 1998, during Russia's financial collapse, two more times in early 2001 as the economy was sliding into a recession and once more after the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001.
 This was also the central bank's biggest one-day cut in the federal funds rate, which is its target for the overnight rate at which banks lend their reserves to each other. Until Tuesday's reduction of three-quarters of a percentage point, the biggest individual cuts were by half a point. 
 The only comparable rate cuts were in 1982 and 1984, when the central bank, which was following different procedures, reduced the overnight rate by more than one percentage point over the span of several weeks. 
 Fed officials clearly hoped that a bold and decisive act would calm investors and restore confidence in credit markets, where fears about soaring defaults on subprime mortgages have increasingly forced banks to curtail their lending in other areas. 
 But while investors did react with relief, the Fed's move also seemed to validate the fears that the economy is closer to a recession than policy makers had thought. 
 On Wall Street, many if not most analysts had assumed that the central bank would reduce overnight rates by half a percentage point at the next policy meeting. But with the meeting only one week away, few investors expected the Fed to cut rates before then -- a move that could easily be seen as panicky behavior.
 The Fed move carries other risks. Reducing the interest rate could push up the inflation rate, even as it bolsters consumer spending.
 In a speech this month, Mr. Bernanke strongly hinted that the Fed would reduce rates again at the policy meeting scheduled for next week. Mr. Bernanke had clearly not expected to move before the meeting.
 But the Fed chairman became notably more worried by late last week. Most of the incoming economic data pointed toward a slowdown. On top of rising unemployment in December and depressed holiday sales at many major retailers, there were signs of a worsening credit squeeze, new declines in housing starts and worries about the companies that insure mortgage-backed securities.
 Mr. Bernanke and other Fed officials contend they do not make decisions in order to calm financial markets. But analysts say they became alarmed about last week's stock market plunge and Mr. Bernanke was even more alarmed by the huge drops Monday in foreign stock markets like Frankfurt, London and Hong Kong.
 The drop in foreign stock prices undermined one of the last bright spots for the American economy -- the prospect that a strong global economy, combined with a cheap American dollar, would spur enough export growth to offset a weakness at home.
 The growing sense of crisis added urgency to efforts by Mr. Bush and Congressional leaders to bury their political animosities and agree on a short-term fiscal- stimulus package.
 A spokesman for Mr. Paulson said that he had been busy reaching out to Congressional leaders all last week and that the market declines of the last few days had not by themselves forced him to quicken the pace.
 Mr. Bush and Congressional leaders have both talked about a package that would inject about $150 billion in additional money into the economy. That would equal about 1 percent of the nation's economic output, which economists and Fed officials said could make a difference if the money gets into people's hands quickly enough.
 But even if Congress passes such a measure by mid-February, which would require Republicans and Democrats to suppress their animosities and their contrasting economic approaches, the earliest that tax rebates would actually reach people would probably be this summer. At that point, it would help soften the blow but a recession might have already been under way for months.
 Ultimately, it is the Federal Reserve that has the most power to avert or soften a recession. But its power is finite, and its primary tool -- lower interest rates -- takes time to work.
 ''Monetary policy works with a lag,'' said Mr. Reinhart, the former top Fed official. ''There's nothing the Fed can do to prevent a recession if it is coming in the first half of this year.''

HEADLINE: The Fed Weighs In

 BODY:
Tuesday's stock market gyrations were stomach churning. There is no doubt that without the Federal Reserve's large emergency interest rate cuts, the market slide would have been worse. The main stock gauges in the United States all fell, but not as far or as fast as some of their global counterparts and not as much as feared. 
 It is too early to put the antacids away. The surprise rate cuts -- like the fiscal stimulus plan President Bush announced on Friday -- were mainly intended to show that the powers-that-be can act decisively. That is better than the months of ambivalence and denial that have led up to this moment. There's still no guarantee that it will be enough to pull the economy out of the hole. 
 Since last September when it began cutting rates in hopes of blunting the credit crunch, the Fed and its chairman, Ben Bernanke, have left the impression that they were reacting to events rather than steering them. Until this month, President Bush was touting the strength of the economy as if the prospect of more than one million Americans losing their homes and a possible recession were mere sideshows.
 Rate cuts alone -- even one as deep as Tuesday's -- are unlikely to provide a powerful enough fix, especially given the severe problems in the housing market. Rate cuts cannot forestall foreclosures, turn bad loans into good ones or undo the worse effects of the housing bust on consumer spending. At best, rate cuts may buy some time for the economy to stabilize without being derailed along the way by damaging market panics. 
 The White House and lawmakers are right that the economy needs a broader stimulus package. Mr. Bush's $145 billion proposal is ample, but too heavily skewed toward tax rebates that would provide no relief for tens of millions of lower-income Americans. Mr. Bush's proposal would also spend far too much on business tax breaks, which curry favor with his political base but will have far less bang for the buck than other options. 
 Little wonder then that the brutal sell-off in global markets so far this week was seen, in part, as a vote of no-confidence in the Bush administration's ability to turn the American economy around. 
 If there is one message above all from this week's global market turmoil, it is that the White House and Congress need to put aside their political and ideological differences and come up with a sound stimulus plan that helps to restore both confidence and the economy. The best way to do that is with a package that will get money back into the economy as efficiently as possible: bolstered unemployment benefits, more generous food stamps, aid to states and tax rebates that also go to low-income workers who are most likely to spend their extra cash immediately. 
 If policy makers are smart -- and lucky -- rate cuts and fiscal stimulus will help the economy rebound before Americans suffer much greater pain. If policy makers do not act sensibly and swiftly, they may find themselves where they clearly don't want to be: trying to engineer an even more expensive and politically charged taxpayer-financed bailout of the mortgage mess. If falling markets aren't incentive enough, that should prod them to get the fiscal stimulus right the first time around.

HEADLINE: Legislation On Economy Will Start In House

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Congressional leaders agreed Tuesday that the House would take the lead on legislation intended to stabilize the economy, giving the speaker, Nancy Pelosi, and Representative John A. Boehner, the Republican leader, primary responsibility for reaching an agreement with the White House.
 Senate leaders said it made more sense strategically for the House to act first so that Congress could produce an economic package by mid-February. 
 ''We legislatively have a little more difficult time doing things,'' said Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, after Congressional leaders met with President Bush at the White House. ''We think it would send a tremendous message to the American people that we have something bipartisan that comes to us from the House. We'll do everything we can in the Senate to move it as quickly as possible.''
 The effort will test a new spirit of cooperation that Ms. Pelosi, a California Democrat, and Mr. Boehner, an Ohio Republican, have demonstrated in the opening days of the 2008 Congressional session after a year of partisan friction. But both sides appeared optimistic they could strike a deal.
 ''I think there's an agreement on a bipartisan basis that if Congress can act now, we may be able to avert a serious economic downturn, and that's our goal,'' Mr. Boehner said.
 But some Republicans have already raised concerns. Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, chairman of the Budget Committee, warned of potential long-term costs from a hasty response to economic turmoil. Other Republicans worried privately that the administration could be in such a hurry to get a bill that the White House could agree to too much spending.
 ''If we're going to stimulate the economy through fiscal policy, let's do it correctly, not in a way that damages the economy for the future or basically gets you a short-term political headline but doesn't get you the impact you need,'' Mr. Gregg said.
 Though producing a bill by Feb. 15 would be a virtual sprint for Congress, senior lawmakers who have been in regular talks with the administration said Congress had no choice but to move quickly given the market turmoil.
 ''It underlines the basic fundamental problem,'' said Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana and chairman of the Finance Committee. ''I think it will help encourage Congress to focus on a stimulus package that passes quickly and does not get too loaded down with peripheral stuff.''
 Senior House aides said no final decision had been made on whether the economic legislation would be subjected to hearings and debated at the committee level, though one said the developing timeline made that unlikely. The alternative, the official said, would be to get the chairmen of the relevant committees to contribute and then sign off on the package.
 Few details of the stimulus plan have been settled, according to both lawmakers and senior staff members. Lawmakers say one sticking point will be a Democratic effort to ensure that Americans who do not earn enough to pay income taxes will be eligible for any rebate from the Treasury.
 ''Ms. Pelosi and I expect we'll have a vigorous argument over that issue,'' Mr. Boehner said.
 Democrats, and some Republicans, say lower-income Americans are among those who most need the rebate and would be most likely to pour their money right back into the economy, providing the stimulus sought by the legislation. 
 Senator Pete V. Domenici, Republican of New Mexico and former chairman of the Budget Committee, said he could support rebates for those who do not pay income taxes. He urged Congress to consider spending more than the $145 billion recommended last week by the president.
 ''A larger package would allow us to reach more people,'' he said in a statement. ''I do not believe $300 billion is overreaching.'' 

CORRECTION-DATE: January 24, 2008

 CORRECTION:
An article on Wednesday about a fiscal stimulus plan for the economy described incorrectly the position on the Senate Budget Committee of Senator Judd Gregg, Republican of New Hampshire, who warned of potential long-term costs from a hasty response to economic turmoil. He is the committee's ranking Republican member, not its chairman.

HEADLINE: Rise of Chavez Sends Venezuelans to Florida

BYLINE: By KIRK SEMPLE

DATELINE: WESTON, Fla. 

 BODY:
In December 2002, Ariel Dunaevschi, then the owner of a furniture business in Caracas, Venezuela, was on vacation in New York with his family when opponents of President Hugo Chavez called a crippling labor strike hoping to bring the government to its knees.
 As the protest wore on, paralyzing the country's oil industry and devastating the economy, the Dunaevschis saw a very uncertain future for Venezuela and arrived at a painful decision: they would be better off staying in the United States. 
 They flew to Florida and rented a house here in Weston, a suburb west of Fort Lauderdale that has become so popular with Venezuelan immigrants, it is known as Westonzuela. 
 ''I had a business in Venezuela, I had shops in Caracas, everything was working perfectly,'' Mr. Dunaevschi, 39, said. ''I left everything.'' He added, ''I began here from zero.'' 
 The Dunaevschis are part of a wave of Venezuelans, mostly from the middle and upper classes, who have fled to the United States as Mr. Chavez has tightened his grip on the country's political institutions, imposing his socialist vision and threatening to assert greater state control over many parts of the economy. 
 While many have been able to establish legal residency and obtain a green card, either through business or marriage, others have remained here illegally.
 The surge is an example of how the political and social realities of Latin America are immediately reflected on the streets of South Florida, a dynamic that has come to define this region in the past half century.
 Many Venezuelans have been able to transfer some of their wealth as they have settled in America. For two years, Mr. Dunaevschi flew to Caracas every few months carrying empty suitcases, which he filled with the family's essential belongings and carted back to Miami.
 In Caracas, he laid off the family's employees, sold his cars, furniture and properties and eventually closed his business. Meanwhile, in Miami, he opened a new furniture company and settled into his new American life. 
 According to census data, the Venezuelan community in the United States has grown more than 94 percent this decade, from 91,507 in 2000, the year after Mr. Chavez took office, to 177,866 in 2006. Much of that rise has occurred in South Florida, making the Venezuelan community one of the fastest growing Latino subpopulations in the region this decade. In many ways, the Venezuelan influx is reminiscent of the Cuban migration spurred by Fidel Castro's overthrow of Fulgencio Batista in 1959 and his imposition of a socialist state. 
 Manuel Corao, director of one of several Venezuelan newspapers published in South Florida, said the main reason for the migration was a fear that Mr. Chavez would significantly alter the quality of life for the middle and upper classes. 
 ''The principle reason is fear of change of daily life, the loss of private property, loss of independence from the government, fear of the loss of constitutional rights and individual liberties,'' said Mr. Corao, who relocated permanently from Venezuela in 1996 and runs Venezuela al Dia, a thrice-monthly tabloid with offices in Doral, a Miami suburb where Venezuelans have settled.
 Like many of the Cubans who came to South Florida in the early Castro years, most Venezuelans who arrived during the first few years of the Chavez administration probably did not expect to stay long. 
 ''They didn't think Chavez would last long, so a lot of Venezuelans are moving their families nearby, and the nearest place in the states is Miami,'' said Thomas D. Boswell, professor of geography at the University of Miami.
 Sinking their roots into the South Florida soil, Venezuelans have shifted their money into American banks, married and divorced, opened businesses, become active in local politics, and seen their children graduate from American schools.
 Mr. Dunaevschi's decision to keep his family in the United States was made easier because his wife, from whom he is getting divorced, was an American citizen. ''I could work,'' he said. ''But for a lot of people without papers, it's more complicated.''
 Like many Venezuelans who have recently come to South Florida, Mr. Dunaevschi underwent a significant change in his standard of living. Faced with a much higher cost of living, he abandoned some of the luxuries he enjoyed in Venezuela, like a domestic staff and chauffeur. 
 ''Life was very good there,'' he said. But like many Venezuelans here, he cannot imagine returning as long as Mr. Chavez is in power, a sentiment that echoes the resolve of many Cuban exiles not to return to Cuba until Mr. Castro dies. 
 ''I won't consider it, as long as there's that guy there,'' Mr. Dunaevschi said. 
 Even the defeat of Mr. Chavez's constitutional overhaul in December, which would have allowed him to remain in office indefinitely, did not seem to offer the deeply cynical exile community much new hope. In the meantime, Venezuelan exiles go on with their new lives here.
 There are now at least five newspapers and magazines that feature news about Venezuela and the Venezuelan community in South Florida. Venezuelans have started restaurants and bakeries, business groups, political organizations working on both American and Venezuelan issues, and even a medical center for low-income Venezuelans. 
 ''We untied the boat in Venezuela and now we're here,'' said Ernesto Ackerman, who runs a medical supplies business in Miami. ''We've tied knots in this port.'' 
 Mr. Ackerman is also president of Independent Venezuelan-American Citizens, a group that is trying to encourage Venezuelan participation in local politics. He and other community leaders say they are inspired by the example of the Cubans, who have come to dominate South Florida politics, but they acknowledge that the Venezuelans are still in their political infancy here.
 Venezuelans are outnumbered in South Florida by Cubans, Puerto Ricans, Colombians, Mexicans, Nicaraguans and Dominicans, according to data from the 2006 census, but Venezuelan leaders here believe their population may have vaulted to fourth place on that list, upwards of 100,000, taking into account those who have overstayed tourist visas.
 The growing Venezuelan population has been a windfall for Miami banks, as many Venezuelans bring their money here. Ken Thomas, a banking analyst in Miami, said the amount of that capital flight was unclear, although he said it was ''clearly in the billions.'' 
 ''One of the interesting things about South Florida is that when Latin America is doing well, we do well,'' said Israel Kreps, who handles public relations for Mercantil Commercebank, a Venezuelan-owned bank based in Coral Gables. ''When Latin American is doing badly, we do well.'' 
 For many Venezuelans, the move has come at an emotional price. In return for the relative political and economic security of the United States, they have suffered the cultural dislocation and homesickness familiar to immigrants everywhere.
 One place they have sought camaraderie is El Arepazo, a small cafeteria-style Venezuelan restaurant attached to a Citgo gas station in Doral.
 ''It's become a place of celebrations and protests,'' said Carlos Nunez, 46, a Venezuelan who moved to Miami in 2000 and now owns a company that sells heavy construction machinery. ''We celebrate the failures of Chavez and bemoan the successes of Chavez.'' 
 On a recent Thursday night, several dozen people -- mainly men, mainly Venezuelans -- had gathered at El Arepazo for a weekly dominos session. The matches were lively, the players raucous. They heckled each other and the news broadcastson El Arepazo's seven television screens, which were showing Venezuelan soap operas and news footage of Mr. Chavez celebrating with two Colombian women, whose release from Colombian rebels he had negotiated. 
 Daniel Garcia, 34, an events promoter in Miami, stood off to one side watching the games. Mr. Garcia moved to Miami from Venezuela in 1996 to take a summer job distributing a friend's entertainment magazine. But he ended up staying longer than he expected, and once Mr. Chavez came to power in 1998, he decided to make his relocation permanent. 
 ''There was no question I wasn't going back,'' he said. ''No way.'' 
 Mr. Garcia is now married and has a child. He said places like El Arepazo kept him and other Venezuelans connected and helped numb the longing for home. 
 ''For a while you may forget about Chavez, forget about Miami, you're drinking your beer, you're insulting everybody, you're having fun,'' he said. ''It's a way to forget about everything.''

HEADLINE: Urgently, Washington Responds

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS and STEVEN R. WEISMAN; Edmund L. Andrews contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Even though Monday was a holiday, Ben S. Bernanke showed up early at his office at the Federal Reserve. The next day, he was planning a trip to New York.
 But those plans quickly changed. He watched with growing concern as stock markets in Japan, China and Hong Kong started plummeting.
 Shortly after lunch, Mr. Bernanke called a quick meeting of the Fed officials who decide interest-rate policy. Meanwhile, the Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., watching the same market turmoil spread to Europe, was anxious enough that he called President Bush at the White House at 3:15 p.m.
 At 6 p.m., Mr. Bernanke convened a videoconference with Fed governors and an hour and a half later, he orchestrated the biggest one-day cut ever in the benchmark interest rate, which the Fed would announce early Tuesday morning. 
 Mr. Paulson, having spent the holiday weekend hashing out the details of an economic stimulus package with Congressional leaders, laid the groundwork for a series of White House meetings on Tuesday intended to display bipartisan calm and soothe those who were dubious that the administration could do much to avert a recession.
 No one at the White House, at the Treasury or at the Federal Reserve wants to convey a sense of panic, but there seems to be little doubt that the tumult in the economy has unfolded at a far quicker pace than officials anticipated even a few weeks ago. ''Now we see across the world that the state of the economy in the U.S. is having an impact as well,'' the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, said Tuesday afternoon outside the West Wing of the White House, emerging from a meeting with Mr. Bush. ''So the urgency we feel at home is now even more urgent as we see the impact of our markets on others.''
 Mr. Bernanke had previously signaled a rate cut, but not until the Fed's next regularly scheduled meeting at the end of January, and nothing on the scale of the three-quarters of a percentage point that the Fed announced Tuesday. That seemed to surprise even the White House, which learned of the move, jealously guarded by Fed officials, only moments before it was announced on Tuesday morning before the markets opened.
 For Mr. Bush, the economy now looms far larger as a potential crisis in his final year in office, when he had expected to remain focused on Iraq, Iran and the prospect of peace in the Middle East.
 His meeting with Congressional leaders at the White House on Tuesday was originally intended to discuss his recent trip to the region. Instead it became an opportunity for the president to confirm that the stimulus package he proposed only four days ago, before Monday's market plunges, was on track.
 ''Everybody wants to get something done quickly,'' Mr. Bush said in the Cabinet Room. ''But we want to make sure it gets done right and make sure that we're -- everybody is -- realistic about the timetable.''
 Mr. Bush's proposal of a stimulus package valued at 1 percent of the total size of the United States economy, or roughly $145 billion to $150 billion, has produced some of the most striking bipartisanship of his presidency. Democratic and Republican lawmakers emerged from Tuesday's meetings, first with Mr. Paulson directly and then at the White House, pledging to pass a package before Congress breaks for the Washington's Birthday holiday, which is Feb. 18.
 ''I really feel good that we have the opportunity to do something together,'' Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic majority leader, said outside the West Wing. ''We want this stimulus package to be dealing with the problems of the American people, not ideology.''
 Although the discussion of the stimulus plan began last Thursday, the day after Mr. Bush returned home from eight days in the Middle East, the negotiations continued in earnest over the weekend. Mr. Paulson and Senator Reid spoke eight or nine times over the last couple of weeks, most recently on Sunday.
 ''Everybody was already focused on getting something done quickly before the market events,'' said Michele Davis, the Treasury assistant secretary for public affairs. 
 Later Tuesday, Mr. Bush said Mr. Paulson had been speaking ''with people around the world and, obviously, with people inside America about our economy.'' Neither White House nor Treasury officials would identify the people he called.
 On Capitol Hill, Democrats appeared to be torn between wanting to compromise with the administration and also wanting to blame the administration for failing to act more quickly.
 ''In any credit crisis, it's important to communicate competence,'' said Representative Rahm Emanuel, the Illinois Democrat who is part of the House leadership. ''They have exuded no competence at all.''
 Other Democrats said they were impressed with Mr. Paulson's willingness to compromise to get a package quickly, despite the skepticism about a stimulus package voiced by conservatives in The Weekly Standard and The Wall Street Journal editorial page. In the past, they noted, Treasury secretaries have been prevented from compromising by conservatives at the White House. The declines in markets on Monday appeared to be a unifying moment.
 ''It underlines the basic fundamental problem,'' said Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana and chairman of the Finance Committee. ''The economy needs a boost. I think it will help encourage Congress to focus on a stimulus package that passes quickly and not get too loaded down with peripheral stuff.''
 The White House is careful to avoid the impression that Mr. Bush might be motivated by market drops, or that he is anything but optimistic about the economy, where fundamentals, he said again on Tuesday, were strong.
 ''We don't comment on daily fluctuations in the market,'' the press secretary, Dana M. Perino, said on Tuesday morning, just as Wall Street opened and the Fed's rate cut was announced.
 At 10 a.m., though, Mr. Bush met with his economic advisers, including Mr. Paulson, in a previously unscheduled meeting to discuss the global markets and the stimulus package, Ms. Perino announced later.
 And at 4 p.m., Mr. Bush appeared with Mr. Paulson again, this time announcing the formation of an advisory committee on ''financial literacy,'' to be led by Charles R. Schwab, the founder of the financial services firm.
 ''We want people investing,'' Mr. Bush said as Wall Street was closing, the Dow Jones industrial average having recovered some of its initial losses.
 ''We want people owning homes. But oftentimes, to be able to do so requires literacy when it comes to financial matters,'' Mr Bush said. ''And sometimes people just simply don't know what they're looking at and reading. And it can lead to personal financial crisis, and that personal financial crisis, if accumulated to too many folks, hurts our country.''

 CORRECTION:
Two articles on Wednesday, one on the front page and one in Business Day, about the reaction in Washington to market turmoil, misstated circumstances of a conversation on Monday between Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. and President Bush. According to additional information provided by the White House, Mr. Paulson spoke several times on Monday with the White House chief of staff, Joshua B. Bolten. When Mr. Bolten returned a call at 3:15 p.m., Mr. Bush joined the conversation, at which time Mr. Paulson briefed him on events in overseas stock markets. Mr. Paulson did not telephone the president directly at that point.

HEADLINE: European Bank Seems Content to Wait

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
Monetary policy usually takes some time to bite. That is one explanation for the American stock market's continued gyrations on Tuesday after the Federal Reserve's emergency rate cut. It may also explain why the European Central Bank has given no indication that it will follow suit. 
 But as it becomes apparent that Europe is feeling the slowdown in the United States economy, some analysts said the central bank's focus on inflation may be misplaced. Should stock markets continue to slide and further erode investor confidence, inflation would become the last thing the European bank needed to worry about.
 ''Conditions have changed dramatically of late and even from an E.C.B. perspective, this is not the time to worry about inflation,'' Audrey Childe-Freeman at CIBC World Markets wrote. 
 To decide whether to review its policy, the European bank could look at decisions it made after the burst of the dot-com bubble. The technology collapse kicked off several rate cuts by the Fed, starting in January 2001. The European bank was adamant that the spillover would be limited; still, it was forced to cut rates by May of that year. 
 Ken Wattret, an economist at BNP Paribas in London, said there was a chance that the pattern would repeat. European bankers, he said, may wait for new data showing a clearer deterioration of the market and then move to cut rates.
 Europe's central bank joined the Fed and other central banks in December in injecting funds into the world's money markets to bring down banks' borrowing costs from seven-year highs. It was a coordinated intervention intended to secure liquidity in the financial system. 
 But when it comes to the economy, Europe remains optimistic that it can decouple itself and withstand collateral damage from a possible recession in the United States. 
 Some European officials said the Fed cut did little to change their view. ''As you know, the crisis took its first stages in the U.S., so the U.S. is coping with it and that is their responsibility,'' the German deputy finance minister, Thomas Mirow, told Reuters.
 For now the European bank is expected to remain focused on inflation, which accelerated to 3.1 percent in the last two months, the highest since May 2001. The head of the central bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, said as recently as Jan. 10 that the bank was ready to act ''pre-emptively'' if inflation started to push up wages. 
 At the same time, Europe's economy is facing increasing risks to growth, and some economists said that the bank's focus on inflation might be misdirected. 
 The European Commission may lower its growth forecast for this year, the finance minister of Luxembourg, Jean-Claude Juncker, said this month. Banks are making it harder and more expensive for companies and individuals to get loans, and industrial production is slowing.
 All that may well force the European bank to reconsider, said Mr. Wattret of BNP. Other economists expect the bank will wait until the economy worsens before it cuts rates. At the latest, the bank's concerns will shift to the economy once unemployment in the region rises, said Julian Callow, chief European economist at Barclays Capital in London.

HEADLINE: Thompson Ends Campaign For G.O.P. Nomination

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY; Michael Powell contributed reporting from Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., and Michael Cooper from New York.

DATELINE: CORAL BEACH, Fla. 

 BODY:
Fred D. Thompson, the former senator from Tennessee, dropped out of the Republican race for president on Tuesday after a third-place primary showing on Saturday in South Carolina, a state he had hoped to win when he entered the race riding a wave of optimism among conservatives looking for a strong general election candidate.
 Mr. Thompson's withdrawal came three days after he delivered a rambling speech on Saturday night that signaled that his departure was imminent. Aides said it was delayed because he went to Tennessee to tend to his mother, who was ill. 
 ''I hope that my country and my party have benefited from our having made this effort,'' he said in a statement. ''Jeri and I will always be grateful for the encouragement and friendship of so many wonderful people,'' he added, referring to his wife.
 Mr. Thompson's advisers said he would not make an endorsement in the race. 
 At first blush, his decision would seem potentially to help Mike Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas, who has competed for many of the same conservative voters that Mr. Thompson sought to appeal to. Mr. Huckabee said Tuesday that he might have come in second in South Carolina precisely because Mr. Thompson had siphoned off much of his support, permitting Senator John McCain of Arizona to win.
 ''The votes that he took essentially were votes that I would have most likely had, according to the exit polls and every other analysis,'' Mr. Huckabee said on MSNBC.
 Mr. Huckabee has moved to scale back his own campaign after his South Carolina showing, and has backed away from plans to campaign heavily in Florida. Assuming Mr. Huckabee does not concentrate on Florida, Mr. Thompson's withdrawal could therefore be a boon for Mitt Romney of Massachusetts, who has aggressively sought to pull Florida conservatives to his side. 
 Mr. Romney quickly issued a warm statement praising Mr. Thompson, signaling what his campaign said would be an effort to recruit Thompson supporters as the Republican candidates concentrate almost their resources in Florida in preparation for the primary next Tuesday. Evangelical Christians make up 25 percent of the vote here.
 ''Throughout this campaign, Fred Thompson brought a laudable focus to the challenges confronting our country and the solutions necessary to meet them,'' Mr. Romney said in a statement. ''He stood for strong conservative ideas and believed strongly in the need to keep our conservative coalition together.''
 The development could prove unwelcome to Mr. McCain. He was quick to praise Mr. Thompson -- ''a very fine man'' -- and just as quick to answer the pressing political question of the day. ''I do not expect him to endorse anyone,'' Mr. McCain said.
 Mr. Thompson, 65, entered the campaign powered by the high hopes of conservative Republicans who were disappointed with the field of candidates and hoped that Mr. Thompson -- a television actor and former counsel to the Watergate committee -- could rally conservatives behind him. But Mr. Thompson instead brought a phlegmatic style to the campaign trail, and his candidacy never took off.
 Mr. Thompson ruminated for many weeks about whether to run. By the time he entered the race, much of the excitement had dissipated. His speaking style swung between folksy and laconic to the point of sleepy.
 He played to loud applause at the National Rifle Association and picked up the endorsement of anti-abortion groups. But rival candidates like Mr. Romney and Rudolph W. Giuliani rushed to refashion themselves as conservatives, changing some long-held positions that were more socially moderate.
 That caused Mr. Thompson no end of frustration, but he never found a way to convince Republicans that his bona fides entitled him to their vote. And he drew considerable criticism for his flagging, flickering energy -- some of his walking tours lasted just 10 or 15 minutes, and he often took few questions.
 He drew just 1 percent of the vote in New Hampshire (fewer than the number of write-in votes), and finished fifth in Michigan. 
 Of late, Mr. Thompson cast himself as a country boy who would bring truth to Washington (in fact, he resides across the Potomac River from the capital, in McLean, Va). And in South Carolina, he talked more and more of his Christian faith, attacking same-sex marriage and abortion. But there, too, he found himself boxed in, as Mr. Huckabee, a Baptist minister, had laid a deeper claim to evangelical Christian voters.

HEADLINE: More Aid for City Schools, But Less Than Promised

BYLINE: By JENNIFER MEDINA

 BODY:
Gov. Eliot Spitzer came into office pledging to solve one of the most vexing issues in Albany -- the way the state doled out money to pay for public schools -- and to give New York City a greater share of the aid. 
 Last year, in his first budget, he won a $1.8 billion increase in education aid statewide and promised to increase annual spending by $7 billion over the next four years, much of it going to New York City. 
 But on Tuesday, he stepped back from that promise, saying that difficult economic times made it necessary to scale back the money the state would allocate for public education this year. Under his new proposal, the city would still receive an increase, but it would be $100 million less than the $530 million increase it had expected for school operating expenses this year.
 The city declined to comment on Tuesday, saying officials were still reviewing the budget. But Geri D. Palast, the executive director of the Campaign for Fiscal Equity, which had waged a 13-year legal battle to win more state money for city schools, said the budget would mean fewer teachers, larger classes and less money spent on programs such as extended school days and Saturday school. 
 ''The governor and the Legislature have made a long-term commitment to these kids,'' Ms. Palast said on Tuesday. ''We have an obligation to get them to fulfill that commitment.'' 
 Ms. Palast said that she was disappointed that the governor had stopped short of last year's promised increase, and that along with other advocates, she would turn to the Legislature to try to persuade the lawmakers to fulfill the promise. 
 In his budget proposal on Tuesday, the governor said he would increase basic operating aid for schools statewide -- the money used for day-to-day expenses -- by about $1.1 billion. That is short of the $1.25 billion increase that many had expected. The governor and his aides also called attention to the fact that the total education budget, $21 billion, increased by $1.46 billion over last year's. 
 ''We have protected that priority -- that core priority of investing in education,'' Mr. Spitzer said. Still, he added that some education spending increases could not be higher ''given the economic realities we face.'' 
 He said that all of the promised money would eventually materialize, with some increases pushed back to the next two years.
 But this did little to calm teachers' unions and education advocates, who said that city students had waited long enough for adequate funding. ''The one shining mark the governor had all last year was how he was able to solve a 13-year lawsuit,'' said Randi Weingarten, the president of the United Federation of Teachers, the city's teachers' union. She said education spending should have been immunized against economic hard times.
 Richard C. Iannuzzi, the president of New York State United Teachers, another union, was more critical. ''The governor started a process based on his commitment to fix this,'' he said. ''If we blink now, then the critics who say that public education can't work will run rampant.'' 
 Last year, Mr. Spitzer pledged to make school funding more transparent. He said the new way of funding schools would guarantee that more money would be funneled to poor and urban districts, and he criticized the historical political process of distributing the money.
 But the way the money is being doled out this year is nearly as complicated as it has ever been. To minimize the reduction in the increases to New York City, Governor Spitzer proposed new streams of money that seemed designed for certain school districts. The move was sure to embolden critics, most notably the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, whose Republican majority had fought for more aid for Long Island. 
 New York City would be particularly hurt by a proposed change in the way the state pays for new school buildings. Under the proposal, the state would delay payment for about 18 months, which city officials said would hamper construction plans. 
 Ms. Palast and union officials said they were also concerned that the governor's proposal would limit the influence the state had on how local districts use money. Under the governor's education aid package last year, school districts had to outline how they would spend a portion of their new money. New York City, in particular, came under scrutiny over how it allocated about $258 million. After months of negotiations, the city bowed to the state's demand that it spend more money to reduce class size.

HEADLINE: Foreign Aid and Chicago Past Disputed in Latest Debate Back-and-Forth

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR and CHRISTOPHER DREW

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
In the Democratic debate on Monday, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton said that Senator Barack Obama had not explained how he would pay for his proposal to increase foreign aid by $25 billion a year.
 More generally, Clinton aides say Mr. Obama is often sketchy about how he would finance his proposals.
 Mr. Obama rejected the criticism of his foreign aid plan. ''We account for every single dollar that we propose,'' he said. 
 The dispute was quickly overtaken by larger disagreements between the two candidates on Tuesday, including Mrs. Clinton's accusation that Mr. Obama represented a ''slum landlord'' while practicing law in Chicago.
 What are the facts?
 In a speech to the Chicago Council on Global Affairs last April, Mr. Obama proposed doubling foreign aid to a total of $50 billion a year by 2012. In the speech, he also outlined a strategy for ending the war in Iraq.
 ''I know that many Americans are skeptical about the value of foreign aid,'' Mr. Obama said then. But he added, ''A relatively small investment in these fragile states up front can be one of the most effective ways to prevent the terror and strife that is far more costly, both in lives and treasure, down the road.''
 On Monday, Mrs. Clinton told Mr. Obama, ''You have a lot of money that you want to put into foreign aid, a very worthy program.'' But she added, ''There is no evidence from your Web site, from your speeches, as to how you would pay for it.''
 Bill Burton, a spokesman for the Obama campaign, said Tuesday that the Illinois senator would pay for the increase in foreign aid by ''winding down the war in Iraq.'' This ''will save over $100 billion a year,'' Mr. Burton said.
 Mr. Obama says he would ''immediately begin to remove our troops from Iraq'' and would ''have all of our combat brigades out of Iraq within 16 months.''
 His plan allows for ''a limited number of troops to remain in Iraq to fight Al Qaeda and other terrorists'' and to protect the United States Embassy and American diplomats.
 Mrs. Clinton's comments in the debate reflect a broader concern. She contends that Mr. Obama has set forth many proposals, on issues that include taxes and early childhood education, without specifying how he would pay for them. 
 Mr. Obama has said he wants to ''eliminate income taxes for seniors making less than $50,000'' a year, and he has proposed tax credits for millions of workers to help them offset the burden of payroll taxes like Social Security and Medicare.
 Austan Goolsbee, an economic adviser to Mr. Obama, said, ''The tax proposals would be fully paid for by closing business tax loopholes, cracking down on international tax evasion schemes'' and restoring higher tax rates on some capital gains earned by the wealthiest taxpayers.
 Mrs. Clinton also brought up Mr. Obama's ties to Antoin Rezko, a Chicago businessman who is scheduled for trial next month on federal charges of business fraud and influence peddling connected to the administration of Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich of Illinois.
 Mr. Rezko, a real estate developer, was a major fund-raiser for Mr. Obama from 1997 to 2004, and Mr. Obama has said he was a close friend. During that time, Mr. Rezko's company also defaulted on a series of low-income housing developments in or near the State Senate district that Mr. Obama then represented.
 Mrs. Clinton referred to those projects during the debate, when she said to Mr. Obama that ''you were practicing law and representing your contributor, Rezko, in his slum landlord business in inner-city Chicago.'' Her comment prompted Mr. Obama to interrupt with an exasperated, ''Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.''
 He later defended himself, saying, ''I was an associate at a law firm that represented a church group that had partnered with this individual to do a project, and I did about five hours worth of work on this joint project.''
 Mrs. Clinton's attack on this point appears to have been prompted by an article last year in The Chicago Sun-Times, which said that the buildings had become run-down and that some residents went without heat for several weeks one winter.
 Mr. Obama has said that even though 11 of the 30 buildings were in his State Senate district, no one ever complained to him about the problems.
 Mr. Obama also worked for a small Chicago law firm, and the firm has said that in the late 1990s, when the housing developments were being rehabilitated, he reviewed some of the documents for a total of five hours. The firm also said that it was working mainly for community groups that teamed up with Mr. Rezko, and that Mr. Obama's role was modest. 
 Still, Mr. Obama's relationship with Mr. Rezko remains controversial. In 2005, Mr. Obama bought a strip of land from Mr. Rezko even though the developer was under federal investigation. And while Mr. Obama has not been implicated in any wrongdoing, his campaign announced Saturday that it would give to charity more than $40,000 in past political donations that were linked to Mr. Rezko.

HEADLINE: Candidates Turn Attention to Gyrating Markets and Weakened Economy

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY; Reporting was contributed by Jeff Zeleny in Greenville, S.C.; Patrick Healy in Washington; Julie Bosman in Conway, S.C.; Michael Powell in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla.; and Sarah Wheaton in Coral Beach.

DATELINE: CORAL BEACH, Fla. 

 BODY:
The weakened economy and the turmoil in financial markets have helped to cement a gradual shift in emphasis in the presidential campaign to domestic issues from national security, giving the candidates an opportunity on Tuesday to spotlight economic proposals and try to convince voters that they could handle a crisis.
 Even before the stock market opened the candidates were rolling out, or reintroducing, stimulus plans, speeches, television advertisements and statements that suggested how they would handle a situation like this. There were differences in what they were proposing -- the Republicans pressed more for tax cuts for individuals and business; the Democrats called for increasing government spending -- but the urgency of the response reflected a common calculation that the race for president had changed in a potentially fundamental way. 
 ''When things like this occur, I'd point out how important it is to have a president who has had a job in the private sector: I have been in the private sector for 25 years,'' former Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts said to a packed house at Wings, a restaurant here 50 miles north of Miami. His remarks coincided with a television advertisement he began running here that played up his business experience.
 It was not clear how much the economic trouble -- the stock market's gyrations, the emergency intervention by the Federal Reserve and the spike in mortgage foreclosures -- might change the rules of the game, or for how long. 
 Still, there was a consensus among all the candidates that the economy had supplanted the war as an issue and, in the process, changed the dynamics of both the Republican and Democratic contests. Mr. Romney and Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York both called news conferences to talk about the issue; Mrs. Clinton's campaign prepared an advertisement describing her economic plan.
 Senator Barack Obama of Illinois cited his plan for jump-starting the economy with $250 tax rebates, as he delivered an economic address at Furman University in Greenville, S.C. ''We woke up this morning to bad news from Wall Street,'' Mr. Obama said, a refrain that was echoed throughout the day by Democrats and Republicans alike.
 Mr. Romney and Mrs. Clinton appeared best positioned to benefit from a sharp shift in voter concern from foreign affairs to the economy.
 An ABC News/Washington Post poll of Democratic primary voters earlier this month found that Mrs. Clinton was seen as best equipped to handle the economy by 46 percent of respondents, compared with 33 percent who named Mr. Obama and 13 percent who named former Senator John Edwards of North Carolina. Mrs. Clinton's emphasis on the issue dovetailed with her effort to present herself as more prepared for the presidency than Mr. Obama.
 Mr. Romney's swift move to concentrate on the economy, to two audiences and a news conference Tuesday morning, reflected the belief by his advisers that his managerial background was as much an asset to him in this kind of environment as Senator John McCain's military background was for him at a time when the war and national security were at the head of voter concerns.
 Mr. Romney, in a speech to Jewish leaders in Boca Raton, sought to portray an air of reassuring confidence as he went through an economic plan that included tax cuts to business to encourage investment, as well as to individuals to spur spending.
 ''Every time I've seen things really get scary and the markets really collapse, I put aside my fear and say -- aha, this is a buying opportunity,'' he said. ''My experience is, whatever goes down goes up.''
 Former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York was more sketchy as he answered questions about how he would handle the financial upheaval. Addressing a reporter he knew from New York, he pointed to his experience as mayor in suggesting that he was prepared to handle the crisis, but offered no details on what he thought should be in a stimulus package, or what taxes should be cut.
 ''Congress and the president should do a stimulus package and they should do a spending reduction package,'' he said. ''You're familiar with that; we used to do that in New York.''
 The shift could prove particularly complicated for Mr. McCain, of Arizona, who, in his own view, began gathering strength as a candidate after conditions in Iraq appeared to improve; he was long a proponent of increasing troop strength there, and national security and the war are the two mainstays of his campaign appearance. He brought up the action by the Federal Reserve before a question was asked at a news conference in Pensacola, and in a speech there, pushed elements of his own economic plan.
 Those include eliminating the alternative minimum tax, making the Bush tax cuts permanent and cutting the corporate tax rate to 25 percent from 35 percent. ''And, my friends, we've got to cut spending,'' he said. ''Otherwise we will continue to borrow money from the Chinese.''
 The Washington Post/ABC News poll found no appreciable differences among Republicans in their ratings of whether Mr. Romney, Mr. McCain or Mr. Giuliani would be best at dealing with the economy.
 Mr. Edwards on the Democratic side and former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas on the Republican side have both run campaigns that have hit populist themes -- criticizing abuses by big business and Wall Street -- and seemed to view the developments as something of a vindication of their arguments.
 ''They just told me as I was coming in that the Dow is already down 400 points,'' Mr. Edwards said as he entered a town hall in Conway, S.C., prompting gasps from the crowd. ''The truth is that there's a disconnect between Washington and the government paying attention to what's happening in real people's lives as opposed to just paying attention to what's happening on Wall Street.''

 Re ''Debunking the Reagan Myth'' (column, Jan. 21):
 Paul Krugman is right on the mark. Conservatives have made an entire mythology surrounding Ronald Reagan. He is falsely credited by conservatives with everything from brilliant economic policies to ending the cold war. 
 Today we are hearing many conservatives lamenting that conservatism has lost its way. The truth is that conservatives had their way. In six years of unified control of the levers of power, they did more damage than is imaginable. It could take us a generation to regain our former prestige and clout. 
 Conservatism failed in the 1890s, again in the 1920s, again in the 1980s, and again at the beginning of the 21st century. That is the message Democrats need to hammer home at every possible occasion. 
 Conservatives failed because conservatism is a failed ideology. The greatest periods of American history all rejected conservatism in favor of the ideals our nation was founded on.
 Brandon Bittner Royersford, Pa., Jan. 21, 2008
 To the Editor:
 While Ronald Reagan probably isn't the heroic figure the Republicans want him to be, he did represent an attitude that needed expression. Senator Barack Obama was saying that Reaganism was an overdue reaction to the malaise of government dependency that led us away from the ''dynamism and entrepreneurship'' that is just as much a part of this country as giving everyone the opportunity for a better life. 
 Perhaps the level playing field had previously been emphasized too much, and we needed reminding again that individual motivation and effort built and still builds this country. 
 This conservative counter-emphasis was probably overdone in the 80s, but it does show that we need to balance both sides of the American experience and not keep swinging back and forth in the radicalization of either. 
 Senator Obama shows that he understands this duality by using Reagan as an indicator. 
 Bill Cannon Evanston, Ill., Jan. 21, 2008
 To the Editor:
 While I am no fan of the policies of the canonized ex-president, Ronald Reagan was a charismatic leader who helped America recover its dormant sense of glorious self; in many ways, he made us feel patriotic again. And as Senator Barack Obama correctly noted, he profoundly changed the direction of the country; whether that change was for good or bad, Senator Obama shrewdly left to the reader to determine.
 Phil Harnick Sherman Oaks, Calif., Jan. 21, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Re ''In Search of Reagan'' (Week in Review, Jan. 20):
 The incessant and obsessive invocation of Ronald Reagan's name by the G.O.P. presidential candidates to the exclusion of anyone else does not say much about the candidates themselves today, or about G.O.P. personalities in the two decades since Reagan. And it certainly does not say much about the present G.O.P. occupant of the White House.
 Dorian de Wind Austin, Tex., Jan. 20, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Re ''Hillary, Barack, Experience'' (column, Jan. 20):
 Nicholas D. Kristof mentions that Hillary Rodham Clinton's claim of having 35 years of experience is ''spurious.'' Most of her supporters believe that she is more experienced than Barack Obama, based on her experience in the White House and Arkansas. 
 But Bill Clinton, not Hillary, was the ''decider'' in the White House and Arkansas. She was an adviser among many, and had a role with no accountability. Moreover, her advisory role is difficult to evaluate since White House records will not be released until 2012.
 Her Senate experience of one term and one year is the only time she had a decision-making role; therefore she has almost the same ''traditional'' experience as Senator Obama.
 Sunasir Sen New York, Jan. 21, 2008
 To the Editor:
 I could not agree more with Nicholas D. Kristof. As an ardent, lifelong Democrat, I have already seen too much evidence in this campaign that political experience may not be helpful, particularly when invectives are being used to destroy others. 
 This politics of destruction will backfire. It will splinter our party and result in an outcome none of us want in November. 
 Bill Clinton's behavior in recent days is a perfect example. Mr. President, you should know better!
 Wendy Rhodes Deerfield, Ill., Jan. 21, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Re ''Rangel Remains in Clinton's Camp in Her Battle With Obama'' (news article, Jan. 22):
 With many black voters supporting presidential candidates other than Barack Obama, and many women voters supporting presidential candidates other than Hillary Rodham Clinton, it seems that we may finally be entering an era in which candidates are chosen more for their stand on issues than simply for their race or gender. That is a great step forward for our country. 
 Gregory F. Reggie Crowley, La., Jan. 22, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Re ''Fierce Spending in Early Stages Saps Campaigns'' (news article, Jan. 20):
 Given the rate at which the candidates have burned through their campaign war chests well in advance of the country's larger and more costly primary contests, voters should give pause to see who among them has the fiscal prudence to get us through the impending recession that some economists argue may already be upon us.

HEADLINE: Bank of America Joins Parade Of Mortgage-Related Losses

BYLINE: By JULIE CRESWELL

 BODY:
The upheaval in the mortgage market, a slowing economy and an increasingly stretched consumer have made the last few quarters among the toughest since Kenneth D. Lewis, the chairman and chief executive of Bank of America, took over in 2001.
 So Tuesday's emergency rate cut by the Federal Reserve was a ''pleasant surprise'' to Mr. Lewis, who said the move should help stave off a recession. 
 ''It was a bold and decisive move and was exactly what the market needed,'' Mr. Lewis said in an interview. ''Growth had become very sluggish. Absent any moves, we were very close to a recession. This gives us a chance not to have one.''
 Yet Mr. Lewis said the problems that banks -- including his -- have been facing would continue, and he predicted ''anemic'' growth in the first half of the year.
 He made his remarks as Bank of America became the latest financial institution to offer results that showed the depth of the problems in the credit and mortgage markets. The bank said net income in the fourth quarter tumbled 95 percent, to $268 million, or 5 cents a share, from $5.26 billion, or $1.16, a year earlier.
 Like other banks, a huge write-down for bad bets in mortgage-related securities cut deep into earnings. Bank of America, based in Charlotte, N.C., wrote off $5.28 billion in collateralized debt obligations, or C.D.O.'s, in the quarter. The bank still holds about $8 billion in C.D.O.'s.
 Bank of America's results also reflected another troublesome front: problems with consumer credit. The bank doubled its provisions for loan losses to $3.31 billion from $1.57 billion a year earlier. The percentage of net charge-offs, or loans that the bank does not expect to collect, rose to 0.91 percent from 0.80 percent in the third quarter of 2007.
 Likewise, large write-downs in mortgage-related securities and the need to raise provisions for loan losses nearly wiped out all of the fourth-quarter earnings at the Wachovia Corporation, Bank of America's cross-town rival. Wachovia reported net income of $51 million in the fourth quarter, or 3 cents a share, from $2.3 billion, or $1.20, a year earlier. 
 For his part, Mr. Lewis sees no relief anytime soon from consumer woes from credit cards and home equity loans. ''We think late payments, delinquencies will continue. There are several states that are causing most of the deterioration, such as California, Arizona, Florida and Nevada,'' where housing prices have collapsed, he said. ''There is a correlation between places where there have been housing declines and the spread of delinquencies into other products,'' Mr. Lewis added.
 But for customers with good credit, Mr. Lewis said the bank was ready to make loans.
 ''We have tightened standards across the board as we have seen deterioration in the market and our loss rates go up, particularly in small business,'' said Mr. Lewis. ''But to the extent that people do meet our standards, we're open for business.''
 Wachovia shares rose $1.11, to $31.91, while Bank of America shares rose $1.42, to $37.39.
 Last week, Merrill Lynch, the brokerage firm, posted a $9.8 billion fourth-quarter loss, which reflected a $16.7 billion write-downs, while Citigroup wrote down $23.2 billion and reported a $9.83 billion fourth-quarter loss. JP Morgan Chase & Company took a much smaller write-down, but saw its net income decline to $2.97 billion from $4.53 billion in the period a year earlier.
 On Tuesday, Mr. Lewis also confirmed the bank's plan to acquire the assets of troubled mortgage lender Countrywide Financial. In recent days, there has been growing speculation that Bank of America, the nation's largest retail bank, might try to reprice or abandon its plans to buy the lender. When the deal was announced earlier this year, the stock deal was valued at $4 billion.
 ''We did extensive due diligence. We had 60 people inside the company for almost a month. It was the most extensive due diligence we have ever done. So we feel comfortable with the valuation,'' Mr. Lewis said. ''We looked at every aspect of the deal, from their assets to potential lawsuits and we think we have a price that is a good price.''
 Still, one hurdle Mr. Lewis hopes to get over before closing on the Countrywide deal is shoring up crucial capital ratios that have tumbled in recent months at the bank. The bank hopes to raise at least $2 billion from the capital markets in the coming weeks.
 ''It should be easy for them to raise the money, but it's going to cost them,'' as credit conditions remain tight, said Meredith Whitney, a research analyst at CIBC.
 Stock Options for Dimon
 JPMorgan Chase, the investment bank, granted its chief executive, James Dimon, two million stock options after he helped keep subprime-related write-downs to a fraction of those reported by competitors.
 The award was not part of Mr. Dimon's regular compensation and is the first given to him since he took over the bank's top job in January 2006, the company said in a regulatory filing. The options are worth at least $30 million, said Henry Higdon, a managing partner at consultant Higdon Partners.
 While JPMorgan this month reported its first profit decline since Mr. Dimon took over, the bank's $1.3 billion subprime write-down for the fourth quarter compared favorably to others.

 BODY:
7 P.M. (Bloomberg) DEADLY BREW: THE HUMAN TOLL OF ETHANOL As the world's largest ethanol exporter, Brazil is in the midst of a bio-fuel boom. But as the wealth increases, conditions grow worse for the workers who harvest the sugar cane from which the fuel is made, with 82,000 injuries and 300 deaths reported in a single year. This half-hour report ventures into the fields to examine working conditions; into a meeting for the sugar cane cutter's union; and into the capital, where a prosecutor for the Labor Ministry discusses the class disparity that allows plantation owners to grow wealthier while systematically ignoring workers' rights. 
 7:15 P.M. (HBO) THE LEOPARDS TAKE MANHATTAN: THE LITTLE BAND THAT ROARED This final installment in the ''Music in Me'' series of family specials follows the Louisville Leopard Percussionists, a group of about 50 young people from various racial and economic backgrounds with no prior musical training (including, above, Mason Allen, left, and Alex Gee), as they try to take New York by storm with the help of their founder and teacher, Diane Downs.
 8 P.M. (ABC) UGLY BETTY When Daniel (Eric Mabius) asks Betty (America Ferrera) to interview Phil Roth, she thinks she's sitting down with the novelist Philip Roth -- not a pick-up artist -- in this last episode taped before the writers' strike. Meanwhile Daniel learns he has a shocking connection to the woman (Gabrielle Union) who recently caught his eye. 
 8 P.M. (NBC) CHUCK Chuck (Zachary Levi) insists that Agent Casey (Adam Baldwin) fight for his beautiful Russian ex-girlfriend before she marries an arms dealer.

HEADLINE: Japan: Exports Growth Keeps Slowing

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Japan's export growth slowed for a second month in December as a weakening American economy stifled demand. Exports, which drove almost all the third-quarter expansion, rose 6.9 percent from the period a year earlier, after climbing 9.7 percent in November, the Finance Ministry said. Imports rose 12.1 percent in December, after climbing 13.2 percent in November.

HEADLINE: Mississippi to Use Some Hurricane Aid for Housing Program

BYLINE: By LESLIE EATON

 BODY:
As Mississippi awaits a decision on whether it can spend $600 million of federal hurricane relief on a controversial plan to rebuild and expand a shipping port, the state has added $100 million of federal aid to a program to develop housing for low- and moderate-income workers. 
 The addition, which brings the housing program to $250 million, will produce more than 2,500 housing units, said Gov. Haley Barbour, who announced the increase on Tuesday.
 Though it has been widely praised for the speed of its hurricane recovery effort, Mississippi has been criticized by religious and civic groups for slighting the needs of the poor. Congress gave the state $5.5 billion in hurricane recovery grants, with the proviso that half of it should be used to help low-income families, but critics say that less than a quarter of the money is being used that way.
 The new allocation may not dampen that criticism because the money is being transferred from another program that was supposed to help the poor by giving grants to low-income homeowners whose houses flooded in Hurricane Katrina's storm surge. That program received fewer applications than expected, the governor's spokesman, Pete Smith, wrote in an e-mail message.
 The state has distributed about $217 million in grants to more than 3,000 applicants to that program, according to data from the Mississippi Development Authority. A larger program, which primarily serves wealthier homeowners, has distributed more than $1 billion to more than 15,000 homeowners.
 Advocates for the poor said that they were concerned that not everyone who qualified for a rebuilding grant had received one, and that in any event the state was still not committing enough money to programs to replace low-income housing, to help renters or to assist people whose houses were damaged by wind rather than flooding.
 ''Washington is really examining how successful Mississippi's recovery is for all of its citizens,'' said Kimberly Miller, state policy specialist for Oxfam America in Biloxi.
 Her group has urged the Department of Housing and Urban Development to reject the state's bid to use hurricane recovery money to expand the port, in Gulfport, which was damaged by the hurricane.
 The state has asked the agency to waive a rule that limits economic development spending to about $50,000 per job created.

HEADLINE: Nice Resume. Have You Considered Botox?

BYLINE: By NATASHA SINGER

 BODY:
IN a new self-help book called ''How Not to Look Old,'' chapter headings in screaming capital letters warn readers of the dreaded signs of aging that are to be avoided at all costs.
 ''NOTHING AGES YOU LIKE ... FOREHEAD LINES'' admonishes one chapter introduction. Another chapter cautions: ''NOTHING AGES YOU LIKE ... YELLOW TEETH.''
 Nothing, apparently, also carbon-dates you like GRAY BROW HAIRS or SAGGING SKIN or RECEDING GUMS, according to the book written by Charla Krupp, a former beauty director at Glamour who writes a column for More, a magazine for women over 40.
 The book is the latest makeover title to treat the aging of one's exterior as a disease whose symptoms are to be fought to the death or, at least, mightily camouflaged. But the book offers a serious rationale for such vigilant attempts at age control, arguing that trying to pass for younger is not so much a matter of sexual allure as of job security. 
 ''Looking hip is not just about vanity anymore, it's critical to every woman's personal and financial survival,'' according to the book jacket.
 Promoted recently on Oprah Winfrey's show and ''Today,'' the book clearly speaks to the fears of professional obsolescence and economic vulnerability among women over 40, at whom it is aimed. ''How Not to Look Old'' made its debut on the New York Times best-seller list last week at No. 8 in the advice and how-to category. 
 ''Whether we want to admit it or not, in male corporate America we would rather have a cute, sexy 30-year-old working for us than a 50-year-old with gray hair who has let herself go and looks out of it, not in the swing of it, like a nun,'' said Ms. Krupp, a blonde who blurs her age by personifying her advice about donning highlights, bangs, heels and sheer lip gloss. After all, nothing ages you like dark lipstick.
 ''My book is hitting a nerve because I am giving not looking old a spin as if your life depended on it,'' Ms. Krupp said in an interview last week.
 Many people would shun a book if it were titled ''How Not to Look Jewish'' or ''How Not to Look Gay'' because to cater to discrimination is to capitulate to it. But the success of ''How Not to Look Old'' indicates that popular culture is willing to buy into ageism as an acceptable form of prejudice, even against oneself.
 ''Ageism is one of the last frontiers of discrimination where people think that a way around it is not to be seen to age, but we would never say that women should try to look or act more male in order to avoid sexism,'' said Molly Andrews, a psychologist who is a director of the Center for Narrative Research at the University of East London. 
 Dr. Andrews is the author of a 1999 paper titled ''The Seductiveness of Agelessness,'' published in Ageing & Society, in which she argued that encouraging people to mask their age constitutes a form of ageism in itself. ''People who are held up as models of aging well are those who are not seen to age,'' she said.
 The success of ''How Not to Look Old'' comes on the heels of disparaging comments about Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton made by the radio provocateur Rush Limbaugh, who last month said: ''Will Americans want to watch a woman get older before their eyes on a daily basis? And that woman, by the way, is not going to want to look like she's getting older, because it will impact poll numbers.''
 Although Mr. Limbaugh's comments drew widespread criticism, they underscored the idea that older women in the work force are vulnerable to age prejudice.
 In one study on hiring practices, for example, a graduate student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology applied to entry-level jobs in Boston and St. Petersburg, Fla., by sending out 4,000 resumes as a female job applicant; the resumes varied the year of high school graduation, which dated the job seeker as being from 35 to 62. 
 The study, published in 2005 by the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College, found that younger women were 40 percent more likely to receive an offer of a job interview than women over 50; a woman over 50 in Boston would have to send in 27 resumes just to get one job interview, where a younger woman would have to send in only 19, the study said.
 ''Seeming young can definitely help your economic status, and that pays the rent,'' said Joanna N. Lahey, the author of the study, who is now an assistant professor of public policy at Texas A & M. 
 A half-dozen women interviewed for this article said that they had chosen to use age-control techniques either because their jobs demanded it or because they simply disliked the physical changes attendant with age.
 ''The only way to age gracefully in my business is to die young like Natalie Wood or James Dean, but Shelley Winters or Marlon Brando could not get a job on the Food Network right now,'' said Joy Behar, a talk-show host on ''The View'' on ABC. 
 Ms. Behar suggested that working women today are held to beauty norms that are more stringent than in previous generations because of trends in longevity, fitness and cosmetic medicine. ''I'll do Botox and Restylane injections, but my motto is, 'I won't go under.' I won't do anything that involves anesthesia.'' 
 Indeed, the real trend behind ''How Not to Look Old'' is the rebranding of aging from biological inevitability to outmoded lifestyle option.
 And even for women who said their jobs had not dictated the choices they made about their looks, techniques to mask their age may improve their currency. 
 ''In 1985, I saw a tape of myself where my eyes were puffy,'' said Faye Wattleton, the president of the Center for the Advancement of Women, a nonprofit group in Manhattan. ''I looked very tired and bedraggled and not as youthful as I would like to have been.'' 
 Ms. Wattleton said she had an eye lift at that time, followed about five years ago by a lower face-lift. ''I didn't do it because I was worried I would lose my job,'' she said. ''I did it to make a better appearance, a fresher appearance, a more youthful appearance.''
 Ms. Wattleton, 64, described people's outward aging and their decisions to ameliorate it as personal choices that others should not judge.
 ''Being a person who has had plastic surgery and goes to the gym five days a week to work my muscles up so they don't look atrophied as a 6o-year-old, I don't disparage people who want to maintain their appearance,'' said Ms. Wattleton, a former director of Planned Parenthood. ''But what I don't want is a society that tells me I have to.''
 Ms. Krupp argues that economic pressures require most women to adopt age-management techniques. As her book puts it: we cannot afford to let ourselves go! 
 ''What are we going to do if we have to enter the work force at a ripe old age?'' Ms. Krupp said last week. ''Out of necessity, you can disguise the age you are by looking younger, hipper and fresher.''
 She added that Americans of one class, religion or ethnicity have often tried on other identities if they appeared to confer some professional or economic advantage.
 ''There was a book on how not to look Jewish,'' Ms. Krupp said. ''It was called 'The Preppy Handbook' and it was a best seller.''

HEADLINE: Trouble in Our Economic House

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Fed, in Surprise, Sets Big Rate Cut to Ease Markets'' (front page, Jan. 23):
 The actions by Washington and the Federal Reserve on Tuesday are an excellent example of why the free market and the Republican and libertarian philosophy do not work. 
 Republicans believe in few government controls, yet the Bush administration bails out Wall Street investors every time. They say no to big government except when it affects their pocketbooks. 
 Robin Wieder East Rockaway, N.Y., Jan. 23, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Prudent economists have warned that Americans save too little and spend too much. As a nation, we've accumulated debt to maintain lavish spending styles. So what does our government do with monetary and fiscal policy in the face of the current economic crisis? Encourage more debt and spending by lowering rates and giving tax rebates. The message is clear: borrow and spend. 
 Savers and investors, step aside. What we really need are incentives to invest that will create new businesses and raise productivity. But that takes time, and we are too impatient. Our leaders don't have the courage to tell us what we must do: sacrifice. 
 Eventually, we will all pay the price for spending with money we don't have: a lower standard of living. The political consequences may be dangerous. 
 James P. Tuthill Lafayette, Calif., Jan. 23, 2008
 To the Editor:
 The same folks in Washington who helped give the economy its current problems have now proposed a $150 billion stimulus package to correct them.
 The theory used to be that the federal government would run surpluses during the upturn of the business cycle and use them to stimulate the economy during the downturns of the cycle. Now that Washington is running continuous deficits, it will have to borrow the money to finance the stimulus. In effect it is taking money from the economy with its left hand and putting it back with its right hand.
 The old theory was also based on the notion that Americans' use of the stimulus money would have a multiplier effect in the domestic economy. Now in the age of globalization, any additional consumer spending caused by the stimulus may benefit foreign economies more than the domestic one.
 George Moss Columbus, Ohio, Jan. 23, 2008
 To the Editor:
 ''Worries That the Good Times Were a Mirage'' (Economic Scene, front page, Jan. 23) states, ''For the past 16 years, American consumers have increased their overall spending every single quarter.'' 
 Americans have frequently been the subject of criticism for our spending versus savings habits, but can we really be blamed? Our neighborhood banks, once viewed as the solid repositories of our funds for the rainy day and a hedge against inflation, have been paying their depositors the regal amount of seven-tenths of 1 percent on savings accounts, and now are found to have been lending irresponsibly. 
 The mattress appears more and more to be an attractive alternative for my funds.
 Robert Solomon Brooklyn, Jan. 23, 2008
 To the Editor:
 I applaud the Fed for slashing its benchmark interest rate in the hopes of avoiding a recession. But I doubt that the credit card companies will follow suit. 
 No doubt they will maintain their interest rates at 16-plus percent and use the opportunity to make record profits to enrich their chief executives and, yet again, the wealthiest people in the country.
 Shara Lamont Albuquerque, Jan. 23, 2008
 To the Editor:
 In response to possible economic stimulus programs, some economists have raised concerns that providing $800 checks to all Americans will not provide the expected multiplier effect to the economy, as many recipients may simply deposit the proceeds or use it to pay down debt. 
 My wife has the ultimate comeback: Give everyone an $800 gift card. No ifs ands or buts, to get the $800, you have to buy something, anything. 
 Alan E. Hart Greenwich, Conn., Jan. 22, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Paul Krugman argues in ''Don't Cry for Me, America'' (column, Jan. 18) that the solution to America's economic troubles lies in developing financial regulatory systems that take into account the current, complex realities of the United States economy. It should also take into account current social realities. 
 Out-of-control financial markets contribute not only to economic woes but also to social inequities. 
 For example, the bursting of the ''housing and credit bubble'' affects not only investors, but also, and most directly, the holders of subprime mortgages -- targeted for these loans precisely because they were already disadvantaged and thus deemed ineligible for conventional loans. Borrowers are now threatened with the loss of their homes and homelessness. 
 Financial regulatory systems should recognize this impact and protect basic human rights, not just business interests.
 Maria Foscarinis Washington, Jan. 19, 2008

HEADLINE: Wider Troubles Trickle Down to Oil Sector

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
As fears of an American recession ripple across the globe this week, analysts and energy experts are wondering whether the great oil boom of the last five years is finally coming to an end -- or whether it is simply taking a break. 
 While an economic slowdown might lead to lower oil demand, as consumers scale back their gasoline consumption and businesses cut air travel, some economists say this might not necessarily produce lower energy prices. Global oil supplies are tight, geopolitical tensions remain high, and producers are counting on higher prices to offset rising costs. 
 After briefly touching $100 a barrel twice, oil prices have shed 13 percent since the beginning of the year. Crude oil futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange dropped $2.22 a barrel, or 2.5 percent, to close at $86.99 a barrel on Wednesday, their lowest level since October.
 Even as economic growth slows in the United States, some experts fear the world might still find itself confronted with high energy costs, a situation that would be reminiscent of the mid-1970s or the early 1990s. Despite the clouds hanging over the economy, and recent stock market losses, several energy analysts say that oil prices will average $80 a barrel this year, $8 a barrel higher than last year's average -- and nearly double the figure of 2004.
 The prospect of a collapse in oil prices, like the one that drove oil to $10 a barrel after the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s, remains fairly remote. In fact, energy traders are betting on historically high prices into 2010, paying around $83 a barrel for futures contacts that call for delivery of oil in two years.
 ''The rally of the past few years seems like it is coming to an end,'' said Antoine Halff, the head of commodities research at Newedge, a brokerage firm. ''But does it mean we're reverting to the lows we had previously? There are other factors that are providing a floor to prices.''
 Efforts to expand oil production are constrained by shortages and rising costs for materials and labor, as well as widespread project delays. Geopolitical tensions in Iraq, Iran and Nigeria -- and more restrictive policies in Russia and Venezuela toward foreign investment in oil fields -- have hampered production growth from some of the world's most important suppliers. 
 ''I don't think we will have a day of reckoning for oil prices because I don't think we have a bubble,'' Mr. Halff said. 
 Experts are concerned that high energy prices could begin to weigh more heavily on the economy now that lower growth appears to be at hand. On a visit to Cairo on Wednesday, Samuel W. Bodman, the United States energy secretary, told reporters that high prices were starting to hurt the American economy. 
 ''The economy has been able to withstand it until now,'' Mr. Bodman said. ''I believe the $100 price of oil is starting to have an impact.''
 For the moment, the economic slowdown has yet to translate into a significant drop in oil consumption. 
 Barclays Capital analysts, for example, noted that in China refineries were increasing diesel imports to address severe supply shortages. The analysts say that a series of factors that have pushed up prices in recent years are still in play: commercial oil inventories in industrial nations are lower than their five-year average, new production growth from non-OPEC producers is weak, and slower economic growth means that OPEC nations have little incentive to increase production.
 Other commodities also seem to be resisting the economic headwinds. Precious metals like gold, which traditionally act as refuge investments, have benefited from the latest interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, while demand for aluminum, nickel and iron ore remains robust thanks to developing economies. 
 Experts say they simply are not sure how the economic slowdown will affect developing countries like China, India, Brazil and Russia, which have been a major source of rising commodity demand.
 ''There is an awful lot of ambiguity,'' said Bart Melek, the global commodity strategist at BMO Capital Markets. 
 Global demand for oil is still likely to grow this year by about 1.4 million barrels a day, according to forecasts by Lehman Brothers. But some experts say lower economic growth will drive down demand, and therefore prices. Lawrence J. Goldstein, an economist at the Energy Policy Research Foundation, said that from 2005 through 2007, higher prices drove down oil demand in the United States, Europe and Japan by 700,000 barrels a day. He expects global demand to grow by fewer than a million barrels a day this year.
 ''The three pressure points of the market -- the lack of crude oil, the lack of spare refining capacity and the lack of product inventories -- are all going to be improving this year,'' Mr. Goldstein said. ''The problem is what is going to be the real demand growth this year. No one knows for sure.''
 New oil supplies, which have lagged demand growth in recent years, are expected to grow by as much as 2.5 million barrels a day, mostly thanks to investments made by members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, including Saudi Arabia, and partly because of increases in Russia. While these increases could help rebuild a cushion of spare capacity that has been lacking recently, analysts still forecast a tight energy system this year.
 ''The market is still fundamentally well supported,'' said Adam J. Robinson, an energy analyst at Lehman, which expects oil prices to average $84 a barrel this year. But prices could fall as low as $65 a barrel if demand dropped sharply. 
 That would have been considered an extraordinary price a few years ago, but today it is the minimum needed to spur new investments in oil supplies, Mr. Robinson said.

HEADLINE: Entry Process Is Simplified At City Schools

BYLINE: By JENNIFER MEDINA

 BODY:
Trying to simplify the often bewildering process of enrolling children in prekindergarten and kindergarten classes in New York City and to make it more fair, Schools Chancellor Joel I. Klein announced Wednesday that he would standardize applications and deadlines citywide. 
 For years, there has been a patchwork of admissions criteria and timetables in neighborhoods across the city, often making it difficult for parents to find out where and how to get their children into their first public school classrooms. Parents have traded stories about sleeping in tents outside a school to get a child enrolled in a coveted first-come-first-served program. Others have spent hours begging with a principal in the late spring to have a child admitted for the fall. 
 In a statement on Wednesday, the city called the current process ''confusing, unfair and difficult for families to navigate.'' 
 ''We need to replace the numerous rules and timelines with a single, simple, fair process,'' Mr. Klein said in the statement. ''Every family will receive the same information about their prekindergarten options and will have the same opportunity to choose a program that's right for their child. We owe it to families to make their transition to school as friendly as possible.'' 
 Under the new plan, which will go into effect for prekindergarten this year and for kindergarten next year, parents will be required to submit a standard application by the end of March and will be notified where their child has been accepted in early May.
 The Education Department will place students in five categories for admission. For example, top priority will go to students applying to programs in the school to which they are geographically assigned. Students who have no prekindergarten classes in their assigned school but live in the district will receive secondary priority. Students who apply for a program at a school outside their borough will have the lowest priority. 
 Within each category, siblings of students already enrolled in the school will receive priority. 
 Mr. Klein has often criticized various admissions policies for the city's public schools, saying they favor children from certain neighborhoods and those with well-connected parents. In October, he announced a plan to limit the city's gifted and talented programs to students who score in the top 5 percent on an admissions test. 
 While prekindergarten and kindergarten admissions have been less complicated and contentious than those for gifted programs, parents still routinely complain about navigating a labyrinth of programs. It can take hours or even days to find out where to find enrollment applications or where programs are located. (On the Education Department's Web site Wednesday evening, a link for more information about prekindergarten programs with vacancies did not work.) 
 ''It is true that in the past these programs operated as individual fiefdoms -- some applications were due as early as October and November, others not until April,'' said Clara Hemphill, who has written several guides to the city's best public schools. But Ms. Hemphill also said that previously many principals used their discretion to admit students who could not afford to be in private preschool. 
 ''In the past it was always thought that the process was unfair and that well-heeled parents got a better crack than others,'' Ms. Hemphill said. ''This may be more fair, or it may also be more unfair and bureaucratic.''
 Lisa B. Donlan, president of the District 1 parent council, which represents schools in parts of the Lower East Side, said the centralized system would eliminate the ability of local schools to establish ways of allocating seats for schools in high demand. District 1, for example, for years relied on a system to ensure that popular schools were racially and economically diverse. That system slowly eroded in the last several years, after the mayor took control of the schools. 
 ''When local communities have certain values and history, they can't be met by this one-size-fits-all approach,'' Ms. Donlan said, adding that the parent leaders in the district had been pressing education officials for a definitive policy. 
 But many parents have more concerns with the city's admissions calendar, because private preschool programs typically require parents to apply and enroll their children several months earlier than the public schools. 
 ''In my mind, the problem is that there's all these bureaucracies and timelines that are more distant from the parents they are supposed to be serving,'' said Jennifer Freeman, a member of the District 3 Community Education Council. ''Anybody who is considering staying at their preschool or going to a public school has no way of considering both.''

HEADLINE: Doctor Is Accused of Fleecing Mother Out of $800,000

BYLINE: By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS

 BODY:
Prosecutors are calling it an Astor copycat case.
 As with Brooke Astor, the late socialite and philanthropist, there is a son who took care of his elderly mother, and relatives who claim that he mistreated her.
 In the latest case, an Upper East Side doctor, Robin O. Motz, 68, has been accused of swindling his mother, Minnie, 94, a retired librarian and the widow of a Columbia University astronomy professor, out of her last $800,000. Prosecutors said Dr. Motz spent the money on luxuries like vacations, a country house and fancy clothes.
 ''It's a mini-Astor case,'' Daniel Castleman, chief of investigations with the Manhattan district attorney's office, said on Wednesday in announcing Dr. Motz's indictment on grand larceny and money-laundering charges. 
 As in the Astor case -- in which Anthony D. Marshall, Mrs. Astor's son, has pleaded not guilty to stealing millions of dollars from her -- much remains in dispute.
 Dr. Motz, who pleaded not guilty on Wednesday at an arraignment in State Supreme Court, insisted through his lawyer, Sean Dwyer, that he was only trying to do the right thing for his mother.
 Mr. Dwyer described Dr. Motz, who has a part-time practice in Englewood, N.J., and is affiliated with NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia hospital, as a ''dedicated physician and compassionate son,'' and contended that ''there is a lot more to this story than meets the eye.'' He declined to go into detail.
 Dr. Motz, who was released on condition that he post $200,000 cash bail by Monday, said only, ''I never comment to the press.''
 In a telephone interview on Wednesday from her home in California, Dr. Motz's sister, Julie, endorsed the prosecutor's Astor analogy, saying that news accounts of the Astor case had emboldened her and her niece, Nicole Motz, to take their suspicions of mistreatment to the district attorney.
 ''We're upper middle class, intellectual people,'' Ms. Motz said. ''I think people think this sort of thing doesn't happen in families like that, that it's somehow a lower-economic tragedy. Of course we do have the example of the Astors, don't we?''
 She said that her mother had been reluctant to think ill of her son at first but then testified against him before the grand jury that indicted him. Prosecutors said that while Mrs. Motz had been immobilized by physical disabilities, she was still mentally alert.
 Ms. Motz said the family has been unraveling since her father, Lloyd Motz, died in 2004 at the age of 94.
 She said relations with her brother were strained because she was an ''energy healer,'' and he did not approve of her practice of alternative medicine.
 In 2004, prosecutors said, Dr. Motz persuaded his mother to rewrite her will so that instead of giving equal shares to him and his sister, Ms. Motz was disinherited. 
 Ms. Motz said the second will also disinherited Dr. Motz's daughter, Nicole, while giving small bequests to his two sons. Ms. Motz said Dr. Motz, who lives on East 84th Street, tried to put their mother's Upper Manhattan apartment in his name, but was prevented from doing so by a provision in her father's will.
 She said Nicole Motz, a physical therapist in Tenafly, N.J., had been very close to her grandmother, giving a 90th birthday party for her, but that Dr. Motz persuaded his mother to bar his daughter from her apartment.
 Prosecutors said Mrs. Motz's financial plight came to light when Dr. Motz had a dispute with a home health aide and stopped paying her salary and the maintenance on his mother's apartment. 
 Mrs. Motz was threatened with eviction, prosecutors said. A social worker at her building investigated, and realized that she had run out of money, prosecutors said. She was not evicted.

HEADLINE: Hamas Pierces Egypt Border, Opening Gaza

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER; Isabel Kershner contributed reporting from Jerusalem, and Mona el-Naggar from Cairo.

DATELINE: RAFAH, Egypt 

 BODY:
Tens of thousands of Palestinians streamed into northern Egypt on Wednesday after Hamas militants blew up parts of the fence dividing Egypt from the Gaza Strip, forcing an end to the closing of Gaza that had followed Hamas's takeover of the territory last summer.
 On foot, bicycle, donkey cart and pickup truck, Gazans crossed the border for a buying spree of medicine, cement, sheep, Coca-Cola, gasoline, soap, Cleopatra and Malimbo cigarettes, satellite dishes and countless other supplies that have been cut off, especially in recent days during a complete blockade by Israel after rocket attacks from Gaza. 
 From the breach of the border wall before dawn until well into the evening, Palestinians crossed from Rafah in Gaza to Rafah in Egypt -- the city has been divided by the border since 1982, when Egypt accepted the return of Sinai from Israel but declined to take back Gaza as well.
 While the destruction of the fence was an act of defiance by Hamas against Israel, which wants Gaza isolated, and against Egypt, which sealed the border to keep Palestinians out, officials from both countries suggested that what happened here on Wednesday was not all bad. 
 ''I told them: 'Let them come in to eat and buy food, then they go back, as long as they are not carrying weapons,' '' President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt told reporters at a book fair in Cairo. This came after his forces had pushed back protesting women from the Rafah crossing on Tuesday.
 For their part, Israeli officials said that, if controlled, the border opening to Egypt might allow Israel to lock the door to a Hamas-run Gaza and let the Egyptians handle the poverty and problems of the 1.5 million people there.
 Mr. Mubarak urged Hamas to get together with its rival party, Fatah, saying: ''If we speak to one Palestinian party we find the other party gets angry. If we ask them to negotiate without preconditions, some of them get angry. There are many problems between them, but I do not want to get into the details.''
 The prospect of an open border with Egypt was widely accepted as a victory for Hamas and another embarrassment for the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, who leads Fatah and is seen as a partner with Israel and the United States and complicit in the closing of Gaza.
 Mahmoud Zahar, a senior Hamas official in Gaza, refused in an interview to take direct responsibility for ordering the Egyptian border opened, but said: ''We are creating facts. We have to try to change the situation, and now we await the results.''
 With the crossings to Israel closed and minimal goods coming in, Mr. Zahar said: ''Rafah is our only lung. If Rafah remains shut, it means our acceptance to be strangled, our acceptance to die. We warned the Egyptians yesterday that people are hungry and dying.'' Sometimes, he acknowledged, it was necessary to create a crisis to settle another one.
 It was clear that Hamas, pressed by the closing from Israel, which had produced international protests, decided to push the issue with Egypt. Muhammad Mishlahad broke down nearly a half-mile of massive concrete blocks with his big Effer crane. ''I got a call from Hamas at 6 a.m. this morning and they said they had a job for me,'' Mr. Mishlahad said, nearly giddy with the thrill of the day. ''They asked me to come and clear the barrier.'' Asked if he was afraid, he laughed and said: ''Why should we be afraid? This is our state.''
 In Cairo, analysts said that the situation was delicate for the Egyptian authorities. ''It is a dilemma for Egypt,'' said Emad Gad, an analyst at the Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies. ''If it prevents Palestinian civilians from crossing and confronts them with force, it opens itself up to unlimited public scrutiny at home. And if it lets the Palestinians through, they face the risk of not knowing who or what is coming in and criticism from Israel and the United States.'' 
 Here in Rafah, relatives from both sides met, as did business partners who usually smuggle goods through tunnels from Egypt to Gaza. For one day at least, and probably longer, no tunnels were necessary, and Egyptian businessmen brought in goods to sell from the more distant town of El Arish. Some enterprising Gazans ordered goods from Cairo in the morning and went across to Rafah to pick them up at noon.
 Farid Abu Jabara, 45, who helps to run a Swedish foundation for Gaza's handicapped, picked up 50 air mattresses and their pumps, which he had ordered at his own initiative from Cairo at 7 a.m. 
 Muhammad Mowab, 22, a student and barber, bought a cartload of cement for $5.40 a bag, compared with $81 now in Gaza, where Israel has banned importing cement except for specific humanitarian projects. ''I've been waiting a year to get married, so I can build a house,'' he said, then laughed. ''Now there are no more excuses.''
 A senior Israeli official, refusing to give his name because the minister who heads his department is away, said the development might solve a problem. 
 ''This may be a blessing in disguise,'' he said. ''On the level of smuggling, weapons and so on, it makes no difference. But if it continues like this, it will ease tremendously the pressure on Israel on the humanitarian level. The humanitarian organizations will get off our backs. There won't be any shortages. So that is a good thing. We don't care if people buy food in Egypt. And terrorists come in anyway.
 ''Second -- there's a notion that Barak believes in -- and I think Sharon did too -- of getting out of Gaza, and throwing away the keys,'' he said, referring to Defense Minister Ehud Barak and former Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. 
 Another Israeli official said of the border: ''Instead of being unofficially open, it will now be officially open. We are starting to talk about it. Some people in the Defense Ministry, Foreign Ministry and prime minister's office are very happy with this. They are saying, 'At last, the disengagement is beginning to work.' '' 
 Fatan Hessin, 45, met a childhood friend, Inshira Hamdal, for the first time in years. ''A few months ago I thought I would never see her again,'' Mrs. Hessin said. ''We are so tired of this life in Gaza -- closure, unemployment, poverty, violence.'' She came to buy a large bag of flour -- $64.50 in Gaza now, and only $17.50 here -- and wished she had money to buy more.
 ''We thank Hamas for this,'' Mrs. Hessin said, holding on to Mrs. Hamdal's hand. ''I'm a Palestinian, not Fatah or Hamas. But I thank Hamas. This is the best thing they have done.''
 In Gaza, Mr. Zahar and Prime Minister Ismail Haniya called for an urgent meeting with Egypt to work out a new shared arrangement for Gaza's border crossings. Mr. Haniya suggested that Hamas would be prepared to cede some control to Mr. Abbas, saying, ''We don't want to be the only ones in control of these matters.''
 Mr. Zahar, however, said that Hamas and Egypt should meet to discuss the border as well, saying that Hamas is the elected government of the Palestinian Authority. ''We don't want chaos on the border,'' he said. ''We can patrol our side. We want to keep out criminals and drug traffickers.'' But he emphasized that Hamas saw Gaza and the West Bank as a single state.
 Mr. Abbas's appointed government in the West Bank denounced Mr. Haniya's suggestion. Ashraf Ajrami, a cabinet minister, said that Mr. Haniya was ignoring Mr. Abbas's demand that it return Gaza to his control. ''Everything Haniya is saying is simply to exploit this situation to win political gains,'' he said. 
 Gazans of all classes walked into Egypt, their numbers limited only by the dire shortage of gasoline. Ala Shawa and his wife, Hana, her hair fashionably streaked, walked through the dirt streets of the Egyptian side. ''I'm bringing my wife to have a vacation,'' Mr. Shawa joked, after months of being unable to travel from Gaza.
 Mrs. Shawa said: ''I'm here to buy chocolate and Coke for my kids, who are at school. I want to bring my kids to El Arish beach.'' Then she said, ''This is the best thing Hamas has ever done.''
 Ahlan Ashour, 38, came with his wife to visit the Egyptian family, the Barhoums, who had put them up for 24 days during an earlier period when the Rafah crossing was shut. Mr. Ashour's wife, Mohsin Elloulu, said she was struck by how much poorer the Egyptians of Rafah are. ''At least our streets are paved,'' she said of Gaza. The current lack of electricity and supplies is terrible, she said. ''But materially, we're so much more advanced in Gaza.'' A driver here, she said, makes less than $1.50 a day, and in normal times in Gaza, $27. ''But nothing is normal now,'' she said.
 Ismail, a 26-year-old Egyptian, was selling bars of soap and packets of washing powder for clothes, making a profit of 33 percent over the normal Egyptian price. ''We are very clear about deceiving the Palestinians,'' he said with a laugh. ''We need to live, too.''
 Hanan Bissisou, 55, wore a sweater emblazoned, ''Now or Never.'' He was buying cigarettes and a list of medications for his mother-in-law for her blood pressure and kidney problems. Top of the list were antacids, which are no longer available in Gaza.
 A young man brushed by, burdened with suitcases. The man, Muhammad Abu Qassem, 23, has a place at Petra University in Jordan but was unable to get out of Gaza. He was woken by his father before dawn. ''He told me to go,'' Mr. Qassem said. He showed his visa, airline tickets and entrance certificate. ''I hope they let me fly from Cairo,'' he said.

CORRECTION-DATE: January 26, 2008

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, a front-page article on Thursday about the entry of tens of thousands of Palestinians into Egypt after Hamas militants destroyed part of a fence at the border with Gaza described incompletely the events regarding Gaza and Egypt three decades ago. In that era, Egypt accepted the return of Sinai from Israel but declined to take back Gaza, not just the Gazan half of the border city of Rafah. The article also misstated, in some editions, the location of the border. It separates Gaza from northern Egypt, not southern Egypt.

HEADLINE: Ambition Knows No Season

BYLINE: By WELD ROYAL

 BODY:
IN winter in Juneau, Alaska, snow blankets everything, bears hibernate and Grady Saunders, the owner of the Heritage Coffee Company, fills his schedule with trips to balmy coffee-growing parts of the world. He recently got back from a trip to Kona, Hawaii.
 Still, Mr. Saunders keeps his cafes and other retail outlets open year-round, even though for at least a third of the year, this tiny city seems an inhospitable place to run a business. Gone are the cruise ships that bring almost a million tourists to this southeast Alaska town from late spring to late summer. Locals number about 31,000, and many of them head for warmer climates as the days become short and temperatures drop. 
 Seasonal changes in the economy are not unique to Alaska, of course. Most of the other 49 states have ups and downs depending on weather, school calendars or annual events. But the intensity of Alaska's seasonal variation is greater than in any other state or the nation as a whole, according to Dan Robinson, an economist with the state's Department of Labor and Workforce Development. He said Alaska's economy loses about 10 percent of its jobs from August to January every year. It starts to gain back those jobs in January.
 Donald Getz, a University of Calgary business professor and author of ''Event Management and Event Tourism,'' who has studied small businesses operating in tourist-dependent economies, divides the owners into two types: lifestyle entrepreneurs and business growers. Lifestyle entrepreneurs, he said, want to live in a nice place and use their business income to help sustain their existence in towns that often are expensive places to live. 
 Mr. Getz said these business owners often move with the seasons, running a bed and breakfast in Alaska in the summer, for instance, and another in Hawaii in winter. 
 Business growers, in contrast, are ambitious, and want their operations to turn a profit. ''They're always on the lookout for opportunities that will see them through the quiet season,'' he said.
 Mr. Saunders, 56, who has been in the coffee business for 33 years, falls into the second category. He has developed strategies to see Heritage through the inhospitable months. While summer days are a frenzy of hiring temporary workers, chasing after coffee beans that are missing and helping institutional customers during their busy season, he uses the fall and winter to meet suppliers. 
 ''The key to the specialty coffee business is growing better coffee, and for us that means checking out new farms, seeing their growing methods and how they treat their people,'' he said. During the quiet season, Mr. Saunders has been to Costa Rica, Panama, Brazil, Kenya and Tanzania and plans a trip to Ethiopia in November.
 He has also come up with new ways to extend the summer season. Heritage developed a line of in-room single-serve coffee packages for the 150 or so hotels, lodges and bed and breakfasts throughout Southeast Alaska. They start ordering in mid-April, which means Heritage, which roasts and packages its own beans, starts preparing to ship coffee to the hotel industry in March. Mr. Saunders also opened a restaurant in Juneau two years ago that is a short walk from the state Capitol building for the 60 legislators, their aides and lobbyists in town for the legislative session, which starts in January. 
 Some of Mr. Saunders's diversification ideas have not worked out. He opened a cafe in Seattle, but sold it in a year, he said, after realizing the headaches of managing long distance. 
 Dawn Walsh, 47, and Sydney Mitchell, 43, are also business growers. They are energetic, daring, even a bit crazy. After all, who else would open a boutique for stylish shoes in a town where it rains about 220 days a year and where snow may be on the ground until April? 
 Almost three years ago, Ms. Walsh and Ms. Mitchell started Shoefly Inc., along Juneau's harbor, across the street from the cruise ship docks. ''Real Women Ignore the Weather'' was used for an advertising campaign. The store's shelves are stocked with red and white pumps with four-inch heels by Naughty Monkey, magenta suede shoes by Farylrobin and other footwear from European and American designers. In midwinter customers trickle in, one or two an hour, in contrast to as many as 200 a day in mid-July.
 ''Having that peak season makes a big difference in terms of what we can stock,'' Ms. Mitchell said. That is because shoe manufacturers sell in bulk -- a dozen pairs in a particular size and color, for instance. Local customers may buy a pair or two, but the store is not able to sell all of them without the summer traffic. 
 ''There are many women in Juneau who are fashion forward, but just not enough of them,'' Ms. Mitchell said. The duo finds ways to lure those left in town into the store in cold months. They are currently holding a designer shoe and handbag consignment event. They price and help sell high-end items customers bring to them. 
 They have also expanded. In October, they bought the nearby Hudsons Shoes, a 68-year-old institution that sells more conservative lines. With the purchase came about 150 pairs of unsold shoes from decades ago, including Converse sneakers from the 1970s and antique Buster Brown models for girls. In February, Ms. Walsh and Ms. Mitchell will hold a ''vintage shoe sale'' to move the historic merchandise. 
 Marketing innovations, economic diversification and regulations have helped to ease some of Juneau's seasonal swings, according to Lance Miller, until recently director of the Juneau Economic Development Council. Local contractors have found new ways to build indoors when the weather turns bad. The mining industry is much busier than it was a few years ago and the work is year-round. Mr. Miller said international fishing regulations have helped to spread out that industry's catch periods. 
 But Mark Stopha, a 43-year-old commercial fish seller, said winter remains slow. Mr. Stopha, who owns the Alaska Wild Salmon Company, said he often puts in 18-hour days in summer buying and selling salmon. In winter, he is in his home kitchen inventing new uses for fish. He said about 25 percent of his company's revenue now comes from products with long shelf lives. 
 Juneau in winter, he said, ''is a great laboratory.''
 ''If you've got something to try out, people have all the time in the world to talk to you.''

HEADLINE: Next on the Worry List: Shaky Insurers of Bonds

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ and JENNY ANDERSON; Julie Creswell contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Even as stocks ended five days of losses with a surprising recovery on Wednesday, officials began moving to defuse another potential time bomb in the markets: the weakened condition of two large insurance companies that have guaranteed buyers against losses on more than $1 trillion of bonds.
 Regulators fear a possible chain of events in which the troubled bond insurers, MBIA and Ambac, might be unable to keep their promise to pay investors if borrowers default on their debt. 
 That could leave the buyers of the bonds -- including many banks and pension funds -- on the hook for untold billions of dollars in losses, shaking confidence in the financial system. 
 To avoid a possible crisis, insurance regulators met with representatives of about a dozen banks on Wednesday to discuss ways to shore up the insurers by injecting fresh capital, much as Wall Street firms have turned to outside investors recently after suffering steep losses related to subprime mortgages. 
 While it is unclear what steps, if any, the banks and regulators may ultimately take, the talks focused on raising as much as $15 billion for the companies, according to several people briefed on the discussion who asked not to be identified because of the sensitive nature of the discussions. 
 The notion that the failure of even one big bond insurer might touch off a chain reaction of losses across the financial world has unnerved Wall Street and Washington. It was a factor in the Federal Reserve's decision on Tuesday to calm investors by reducing interest rates by three-quarters of a point, to 3.5 percent.
 News of Wednesday's meeting helped rally stocks, which had been down as much as 3 percent but ended up about 2 percent. Shares of MBIA jumped by nearly a third and Ambac jumped 72 percent, although they both remain far below their levels before the extent of the mortgage debacle became known.
 Traditionally, bond insurance has been a low-risk business. State and municipal bonds rarely defaulted, so the insurers paid out few claims for such debt. But in recent years the bond insurers increasingly have guaranteed debt related to subprime mortgages, a business that they thought was safe but has turned out to be risky.
 Now, as many subprime borrowers are defaulting, insurers could be obligated to cover some of the losses on securities backed by these loans.
 Eric R. Dinallo, the New York insurance superintendent who regulates MBIA, called Wall Street executives on Tuesday to set up the meeting at his office in Lower Manhattan. He led the session on Wednesday and suggested that the group move in as little as 48 hours to get a deal done ahead of any downgrading of the bond guarantors by credit ratings firms.
 According to two people, Mr. Dinallo said he would talk with the bankers one on one and reconvene the group -- which included executives from Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch -- on Thursday or Friday. Neither federal officials nor executives of the two insurers attended the meeting. 
 ''Regulators are furiously trying to come up with a plan,'' said Rob Haines, an analyst at CreditSights, a research firm, who was not at the meeting.
 Mr. Dinallo could face resistance from banks that do not have significant exposure to the guarantors and thus have less incentive to put up money. It is also unclear how executives and shareholders of the companies would react to the plan and the prospect of ceding control.
 Sean Dilweg, the commissioner of insurance in Wisconsin, which regulates Ambac, sat in on the meeting but said he would be working with Ambac directly. Mr. Dilweg said he met separately on Tuesday with executives at Ambac, which is based in New York but chartered in Wisconsin. 
 ''Eric is looking at the overall issue, but I am pretty confident that we will work through Ambac's specific issues,'' Mr. Dilweg said in a telephone interview. ''They are a stable and well-capitalized company but they have some choices to make.''
 Other options open to the banks include providing lines of credit and other backup financing to the guarantors. A chief goal of any rescue would be to help the companies regain or keep triple-A credit ratings, which are seen as vital to their business.
 Late last year, Mr. Dinallo encouraged Berkshire Hathaway, the company controlled by Warren E. Buffett, to enter the bond insurance business. At the time, Mr. Buffett said he did not want to invest in existing guarantors because of their financial problems, and he started his own firm instead. 
 Since then, the troubles have worsened. Last week, Fitch Ratings downgraded Ambac's credit ratings to double-A, from triple-A. MBIA still has a triple-A rating from the three agencies; the others are Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Service.
 While $15 billion might seem like a large amount of money for banks to commit to bond guarantors at a time when many investors have lost faith in them, Mr. Haines said it would be smaller than the billions the banks might have to write down if the companies lost their top ratings or incurred major losses.
 ''It's a calculated kind of risk,'' he said.
 A spokesman for Ambac did not return calls seeking comment. A spokeswoman for MBIA declined to comment.
 Analysts say it is unclear how much money would be needed to capitalize the companies adequately. Ratings agencies have changed their requirements several times already as they update their assumptions of defaults and losses on mortgage securities.
 ''What is needed to do the job is to solidify the market perception of a triple-A rating,'' said Sean Egan, founder of Egan-Jones Ratings, a firm that says the companies may need to raise as much as $30 billion. 
 A recent effort by some banks to help a smaller bond insurer, ACA Capital, has not gone smoothly. The banks have twice agreed to give the company, which was downgraded to triple-C from single-A, more time to come up with an acceptable plan. 
 State regulators are under pressure to help solve a problem that many critics say could have been avoided with closer supervision. The insurers' problems are also spilling over into the municipal bond market, making it harder for cities, counties and states to raise money for projects.
 On Wednesday, for instance, some short-term insured municipal bonds, which typically trade at a premium to other bonds, were trading at a discount of as much as 1.5 percentage points to similar uninsured bonds, said Michael S. Downing, an account manager at Thomson Financial.
 The companies have defended their assumptions. They also note that losses on the bonds that they insure would have to rise substantially before they would have to pay claims, and even then they would make interest and principal payments over the life of the bond, not all at once. 
 MBIA has estimated that in the worst case, which it described as a one in 10,000 event, it expects to incur losses of $10 billion, a fraction of the $673 billion it has insured. 
 Still, losses of that magnitude could strain the company's finances, and the difficulties continue to mount. On Wednesday, Moody's said it was considering downgrading a company, Channel Re, that reinsures more than $40 billion of insurance contracts written by MBIA. If the reinsurer is downgraded, MBIA, which owns more than 17 percent of Channel, would have to acknowledge fresh losses.
 ''If you are a bond insurer or bank you can never really eliminate the risk that you originated in entirety, unless you sell it,'' said Edward J. Gerbeck, chief executive of Tempus Advisors.

A front-page article on Thursday about moves to strengthen the finances of some bond insurance companies misspelled the surname of the chief executive of Tempus Advisors, who commented on the risk the companies are facing. He is Edward J. Grebeck, not Gerbeck.

HEADLINE: A Day of Sharp Swings, and a Final Gain

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
This week, investors were bracing for Black Tuesday. Instead, they got Whiplash Wednesday.
 A day after the Federal Reserve slashed interest rates, averting a nasty nose dive in the market, Wall Street watched as the Dow Jones industrial average swung like a yo-yo, diving nearly 250 points in the opening minutes, spending the day in a series of rallies and swoons, then closing up -- way up -- with a gain of nearly 300 points to snap a five-day losing streak. 
 Market volatility is near its highest level in five years. In a three-hour span in the afternoon, the blue-chip index ricocheted by almost 600 points. 
 ''The market has this out-of-control feeling, and until the market sees some semblance of stability, it's going to continue to be very volatile,'' said Richard Sparks, senior equities analyst at Schaeffer's Investment Research.
 The Dow closed up 2.5 percent at 12,270.17, a gain of 298.98 points, erasing its losses from Tuesday. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 2.1 percent, or 28.10 points, to close at 1,338.60.
 For much of the day, the Nasdaq composite index traded in bear market territory, down more than 20 percent from its high in October, until a late recovery nudged the tech-heavy index back up to a 1.1 percent gain.
 There were few obvious reasons for the market's mood swings. The session started with a plunge after Apple and Motorola, two technology heavyweights, issued lackluster profit forecasts, raising fears about the resilience of corporate earnings in the face of a likely recession.
 The reports spooked investors and dragged down the technology sector; Apple shares declined 10 percent, and shares of Motorola fell by nearly twice that amount. 
 ''Apple is basically a bellwether,'' said David Kovacs, a quantitative strategist at Turner Investment Partners in Berwyn, Pa. ''If a company such as Apple cannot withstand a slowdown, then what is the fate of all other companies?''
 But the markets reversed course around midday. Shares of financial firms, beaten down by months of mortgage-related write-offs, rebounded as investors drove up the stock prices of companies like Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase & Company, which leapt more than 12 percent. 
 Investors were most likely lured by reports that New York State regulators would work with Wall Street to help rescue a group of bond reinsurers, whose woes have depressed financial stocks for weeks. The aid effort -- coupled with the Fed's aggressive interest rate cut, which was aimed at easing the current credit crunch -- might have made the financial sector more attractive, especially to bargain hunters.
 Indeed, several analysts said on Tuesday that the market had been oversold after suffering one of the worst January starts on record. Investors ''were looking at opportunities to take advantage of the bloodbath we've seen since the beginning of the year,'' said Ryan Larson, senior equity trader at Voyageur Asset Management.
 Companies that depend on consumer spending, one of last year's worst-performing sectors, benefited from the day's gains, as did home builders, which have been badly hurt by the housing downturn. Shares of the Lennar Corporation, one of the nation's largest residential developers, soared 13 percent on Wednesday, a welcome development after dropping 72 percent in the last year.
 Still, some market watchers cautioned that in a time of great uncertainty -- with everything from corporate earnings to economic strength to Fed policy decisions shrouded in doubt -- a single day's gain does not make a trend. ''This rebound is probably only as good as the next economic release,'' said Russ Koesterich, an investment strategist at Barclays Global Investors. 
 And Sam Stovall, a strategist at S.& P., suggested that the market's steep swings and afternoon rally might have resulted from a simple rule of finance. 
 ''Even in a bear market environment,'' Mr. Stovall said, ''you can't fall every day.''
 For the most part, Asian stocks were calm as they opened Thursday, but started to move higher as the day went on. Major indexes in Australia, Hong Kong, Japan and Taiwan were all about 2 percent higher in midday trading. The Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges were flat.
 On Wednesday, however, global stocks remained highly volatile a day after the Fed's emergency interest rate cut. Asian shares gained sharply after a two-day mauling, and many European markets opened with modest gains, in part on hopes for a rate cut in Europe. But the chief European central banker, Jean-Claude Trichet, indicated in Brussels that no monetary easing was in the cards. 
 Mr. Trichet's remarks, combined with signals from the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan and others that they intended to hold rates steady, sent major European indexes sharply lower, and overnight trading in American index futures signaled that Wall Street would open lower as well.
 At the close, the CAC 40 in Paris on Wednesday was down 4.3 percent, the DAX 30 in Frankfurt was down 4.9 percent and the FTSE 100 in London was off 2.3 percent. 
 Eric Chaney, chief economist for Europe at Morgan Stanley in London, said the market was ''impatient'' for a European rate cut, but that Mr. Trichet's comments were not quite as hawkish as some seemed to think.
 ''The E.C.B. had a tightening bias previously,'' Mr. Chaney said, but Mr. Trichet ''left open the possibility of a move toward a neutral bias.'' 
 Following is the result of Wednesday's auction of four-week cash management bills:

HEADLINE: Trapped in Gaza

 BODY:
The neglect and mistreatment of the 1.5 million Palestinians trapped in the Gaza Strip is a disgrace, and a very dangerous one. They are pawns in the struggle among Hamas, which controls Gaza and uses the territory to bombard Israel daily; its rivals in the Fatah movement that run the Palestinian Authority and the West Bank; and Israel. If something isn't done quickly to address the Gazans' plight, President Bush's Annapolis peace process could implode. 
 It is no wonder that tens of thousands of Palestinians rushed out of Gaza into Egypt on Wednesday after a metal border wall was toppled. Life for Gazans, never easy, has been worsening since Hamas seized control last summer, and most international aid -- except humanitarian assistance -- was cut off. Hamas has turned a deaf ear to the Gazans' plight, refusing to negotiate peace or accept Israel's right to exist. 
 Life got truly desperate last week when Israel, reacting to a sustained and intense barrage of rocket fire, blockaded Gaza and stopped all shipments except emergency supplies. When the border wall was breached on Wednesday, Gazans went on a buying spree in Egypt, stocking up on fuel, medicine, soap, cigarettes, cement, chickens and goats.
 We are deeply concerned about the many innocent Israelis who live along the border with Gaza and must suffer through the constant bombardment. But Israel's response -- shutting off power and other essential supplies -- is a collective punishment that will only feed anger and extremism. 
 Mr. Bush has said that he is committed to negotiating a peace deal between the Israelis and the Palestinians before he leaves office next year. Allowing Gaza to fester or to erupt into an all-out military confrontation is the surest way to bury that dream. 
 New, more vigorous strategies are required. Arab states, who for years have pleaded the Palestinian case and have thrown their support behind the Annapolis peace process, must use their influence (and their oil profits) to pressure Hamas's leaders to halt rocket attacks, renounce terrorism and align with Fatah in pursuit of a peace deal. 
 Egypt, whose stature as a peacemaker has withered under President Hosni Mubarak, should take immediate, robust steps to shut down the tunnels that allow arms and money to flow to militants in Gaza. It should also accept more responsibility for securing the common border. No Israeli prime minister can sign a peace deal if it doesn't make Israel more secure. 
 The Bush administration, the Israelis and many in Fatah have hoped that squeezing Gaza ever more tightly would force Palestinians there to turn away from Hamas. This week's chaos is proof of that strategy's high risks. 
 Tony Blair, the former British prime minister who is now the Western envoy for Palestinian economic development, needs to come up with an aid strategy that ensures Gazans aren't forced to suffer -- without rewarding Hamas. Mr. Bush needs to appoint a high-level envoy to deal with this and the dozens of other crises waiting to boil over. Gaza is a reminder that nothing in the peace effort can be ignored or taken for granted.

HEADLINE: Voters Showing a Darker Mood Than in '00 Race

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK; Reporting was contributed by Randal C. Archibold in Los Angeles, Abby Goodnough in Boston, Kirk Johnson in Denver and Sam Roberts and Megan Thee in New York.

DATELINE: KANSAS CITY, Mo. 

 BODY:
Whatever their ideological differences this election year, Americans seem able to agree on one thing: the political landscape being crisscrossed by the 2008 candidates is barely recognizable as the one traveled by George W. Bush and Al Gore a mere eight years ago. 
 Obviously, Sept. 11 and its aftermath have changed the country in countless and irretrievable ways. But even beyond the emergence of war and national security as pre-eminent concerns, there has been a profound reordering of domestic priorities, a darkening of the country's mood and, in the eyes of many, a fraying of America's very sense of itself. 
 While not universal, that tone pervaded dozens of interviews conducted over the last week with Americans of all political stripes in 8 of the 24 states that hold primaries or caucuses on Feb. 5, as well as with historians, elected officials, political strategists and poll takers. As the candidates fan out to New York and California and here to the heartland, they are confronting an electorate that is deeply unsettled about the United States' place in the world and its ability to control its own destiny. 
 Since World War II, the assumption of American hegemony has never been much in doubt. That it now is, at least for some people, has given this campaign a sense of urgency that was not always felt in 2000, despite the dramatic outcome of that race.
 Several writers and historians remarked on the psychological impact of such a jarring end to the Pax Americana, just as it seemed that victory in the cold war might usher in prolonged prosperity and relative peace (save the occasional mop-up operation). Its confluence with an era of unparalleled technological innovation had only heightened the nation's sense of post-millennial possibility. 
 Now, Americans feel a loss of autonomy, in their own lives and in the nation. Their politics are driven by the powerlessness they feel to control their financial well-being, their safety, their environment, their health and the country's borders. They question whether each generation will continue to ascend the economic ladder. That the political system seems so impotent only deepens their frustration and their insistence on results. 
 As she considers this campaign, Susan C. Powell, a 47-year-old training consultant who lives in a Kansas City suburb, said that what she feels is not so much hopelessness as doom. 
 ''I know plenty of people who are doing worse than they were,'' Ms. Powell said, ''and nobody's helping them out. People's incomes are not keeping pace with inflation. People can't afford their homes. People in their 30s and 40s, middle-income, and they don't have jobs they can count on or access to health care. How can we say that we're the greatest country on earth and essentially have the walking wounded?''
 Carter Eskew, a top strategist for Mr. Gore in 2000, recalled the factors that drove public opinion then -- like a modest increase in fuel prices and the bursting of the technology stock bubble -- as ''naively quaint by today's standards.'' His Republican counterpart, Mark McKinnon, who advised Mr. Bush in 2000 and now works for Senator John McCain, said the electorate saw this campaign as far more consequential. ''It feels like we're collectively more mature, or collectively more evolved,'' Mr. McKinnon said.
 The change in tone came through in interviews in coffee bars, barbecue joints and shopping malls as people vented about unaffordable health premiums, porous international borders, freakish weather, government eavesdropping, Chinese imports and customer service calls that are answered in India. 
 Like many of those interviewed, Robert W. Jennings, a 45-year-old Kansas City landlord who considers himself politically independent, said he thought the stakes were higher than in 2000, when the country last chose new leadership after an eight-year incumbency. Two years ago, after the adjustable-rate mortgage on his apartment building kicked in, Mr. Jennings had to take an hourly job for the first time in a decade, at the Home Depot. It also provided him with his only health insurance since college. 
 ''I used to be master of my universe,'' he said from a bar stool at McCoy's Public House. ''Now I work for this soul-less corporation. I used to make the rules. Now I have to follow them.''
 Mr. Jennings also does not like the war in Iraq, or its impact on the country's international standing. ''Most of the times I go overseas I say I'm Canadian,'' he said. ''I just get a better response.'' 
 Public opinion polling is also detecting an erosion of the country's self- image. A CBS News/ New York Times poll taken this month found that 75 percent of respondents thought the country had ''pretty seriously gotten off on the wrong track,'' up from 44 percent in May 2000.
 Not surprisingly, that judgment varies by political affiliation. But even 42 percent of Republicans agreed, not far shy of the 52 percent who said so in 1999, in the twilight of an eight-year Democratic presidency. 
 That year, President Bill Clinton hailed the economic momentum of the 1990s by declaring that ''the state of our union is the strongest it has ever been.'' 
 ''Never before,'' he said in that speech, ''has our nation enjoyed, at once, so much prosperity and social progress with so little internal crisis and so few external threats.'' 
 This year's dissatisfaction seems to have less to do with any fundamental shift in the nation's ideological and partisan leanings than with its broadening displeasure with the Bush administration's handling of the war and the economy. In CBS News/New York Times polls taken in February 2000 and January this year, the percentages of respondents who aligned themselves with a given party or ideology were almost precisely the same.
 It is not yet clear how the discontent may be affecting the primary races. The Republican race remains a muddle, and the one Democratic candidate who has made the most populist appeal to change the nation's direction -- former Senator John Edwards -- remains a distant third. So far, at least, his message has not caught on in a race that has been marked more by the historic nature of the campaigns run by Senators Barack Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton.
 Nonetheless, any of the Democrats would represent a sharp break with the policies of the last eight years, and polls suggest that the Democrats began this year with a political advantage they could not have imagined eight years ago. Asked a year before the 2000 election which party's candidate they were likely to support, respondents were evenly divided. Asked the same question this month, they favored the Democrats by 18 percentage points. Much of the shift is thought to have been among independents.
 That swing, fueled by antiwar sentiment, helped the Democrats win control of Congress in 2006. In some states, there is evidence of its impact well down the ballot. In Denver's once reliably Republican suburbs, for instance, Democratic voter registration has grown since 2000 at 10 times the rate of Republican registration. 
 John Brackney, president of the South Metro Denver Chamber of Commerce, and a former commissioner in suburban Arapahoe County, recalled being mocked when he wore one of his old campaign shirts to the neighborhood pool last summer. ''Oh, you're wearing a Republican shirt,'' someone said.
 ''That wouldn't have happened eight years ago,'' Mr. Brackney observed. 
 The issues have also shifted. Of the top eight political concerns found in a CBS News/New York Times poll this month, only three were on the list eight years ago. Terrorism, immigration, the environment and fuel prices did not register a blip back then. (The other top concern identified in recent polling was the Iraq war.) 
 In the 2000 campaign, it was possible for Mr. Bush to deride Mr. Gore's environmentalism to considerable effect. Eight years later, Mr. Gore is a Nobel laureate, and coiled light bulbs and hybrid cars are status symbols. 
 ''Before, I didn't feel personally guilty if I left a light on,'' said Meg Campbell, director of a charter high school in Dorchester, a working-class neighborhood in Boston. ''It just wasn't in the drinking water back then. Now it's almost a religion.'' 
 Since the campaign of 2000, the United States has lost 4,400 men and women in wars overseas, and nearly 3,000 people in the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.
 Hispanics have become the country's largest minority, accounting for nearly half of annual population growth. Gasoline prices have doubled, and the home foreclosure rate has increased by 55 percent.
 The proportion of Americans without health insurance, which was declining at decade's end, has grown by 2 percentage points. Both the unemployment and poverty rates are a percentage point higher. War spending has helped convert a $236 billion federal budget surplus into a $163 billion deficit (reduced from $413 billion in 2004). 
 Some of those interviewed, like Raymond E. Dixon, a Kansas City computer programmer, said they were confident their children would not enjoy the same standard of living they had, calling it a reversal of the American dream. Several said the force of such rapid change, reinforced by the foreboding symbolism of airport security lines and orange alerts, had left the country gimlet-eyed, and wary.
 ''There was something out there we got blindsided by,'' said Emily Kemp, a 30-year-old investment worker in Boston who was an Army officer until 2004. ''At least now we know, and we are actively attempting to thwart that threat.''
 Certainly, some Americans remain bullish. Charles K. Spencer, a 71-year-old investment adviser who lives in the Kansas City suburbs, said he was ''unabashedly optimistic'' about the future facing his four grandchildren. Technology and the free market will provide them with unlimited opportunity, Mr. Spencer said, so long as they are willing to relocate and retrain. 
 But the more common theme, that of innocence lost, was voiced by Erwin L. Epple, 54, and his wife, Fumiyo, 64, who were in Washington on Sept. 11, 2001, and saw the smoke rising from the Pentagon. ''We said that day that our grandchildren will grow up in a different world, assuming the worst about people instead of the best,'' said Mr. Epple, who owns a pizza franchise in Knoxville, Tenn.
 Many of those interviewed remembered the emphasis placed in the 2000 campaign on restoring personal integrity to the Oval Office. Several volunteered that the focus of the current campaign should be on the rectitude of the country's role in the world. 
 ''In 2000,'' said Philip R. Dupont, a Kansas City lawyer, ''one of Bush's big platforms was that he'd restore honesty and integrity to the White House. Then he went out and attacked a sovereign nation that had done nothing to us.''
 As issues like health care, climate change and immigration have become more urgent, Americans seem less willing to dismiss failures of government and political polarization as business as usual. It feels more personal to them now, and they are demanding results. 
 Mr. Epple boiled with frustration as he vowed to vote for the candidate who convinces him that he or she is most able to solve problems. ''I'm sick and tired of the party line and the platitudes,'' he said. ''I'm hearing hope. I'm hearing trust. But I'm not hearing solutions.''

HEADLINE: In a Time of Belt-Tightening, Spitzer Is Said to Agree to a Raise for Legislators

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: ALBANY 

 BODY:
Gov. Eliot Spitzer has agreed to a pay raise for legislators, even as he has called for cuts elsewhere to help close a $4.4 billion deficit, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver has told Assembly Democrats. 
 Mr. Silver passed the word to the legislators at a private meeting in the Capitol on Tuesday as the governor unveiled his budget proposal for the coming fiscal year. 
 Mr. Spitzer's budget called only for raises for state judges, but Mr. Silver told lawmakers the governor would send a bill to the Legislature by the end of next month that included raises for senators and Assembly members, according to several legislators who were present. Mr. Silver's staff members disputed only the timing, saying the speaker was hopeful but not certain the governor would make his proposal by next month. 
 It was not known how large the raise would be. Mr. Silver has previously proposed a 21 percent increase, and Mr. Spitzer's budget proposed a 24 percent increase for judges. 
 The pay for the state's 212 legislators is now the third-highest in the nation. Their base salary is $79,500, but they can earn more than $100,000 with various bonuses for committee or leadership posts. Their pay has not been increased since 1999.
 Mr. Spitzer's move underscores the degree to which the once reform-focused governor is taking a more accommodating approach this year after spending much of last year mired in controversy.
 Asked about the pay raise late Wednesday, Jeffrey Gordon, a spokesman for the administration, spoke of the plan only generally: ''The governor has publicly expressed his hope that this matter can be resolved and said that he looks forward to working with the leaders on this issue.''
 Mr. Silver said in an interview Wednesday that he did not know how the raise would be structured and would not say whether the governor was seeking support for any part of his agenda in return, but he did say the governor also wanted to raise the pay of state commissioners. For much of last year, the governor sought legislative approval for his proposal to overhaul campaign finance laws in exchange for his support of a pay raise.
 Mr. Spitzer's offer could create a tricky situation for lawmakers, and the move could reflect a bit of political gamesmanship by the governor. 
 Since Republicans hold just a two-seat edge in the Senate in an election year when an energized Democratic turnout is widely expected, they may be reluctant to approve a raise for themselves that could turn into a campaign issue for their challengers. 
 Democrats hold so large a majority in the Assembly -- 108 to 42 -- that they have no such concerns. On the other hand, relatively few Senate races are likely to be hotly contested, so a majority of the senators might find it hard to pass up a pay raise. They could avoid a reaction at the polls by scheduling a vote on the measure after the November election.
 Complicating the picture is the worsening economic situation in New York. ''It's not a great time to be giving a raise,'' said Elizabeth Lynam, deputy research director of the Citizens Budget Commission, a watchdog group, and an unpaid adviser to a new property tax commission created by the governor.
 ''Certainly there are layoffs being announced at a lot of private sector firms and probably more on the way, and they've talked about selective hiring, keeping the head count under control and a possible hiring freeze,'' she said. 
 In the interview, Mr. Silver declined to give details of his conversations with the governor or the Assembly members, but he did say he and the governor had discussed a bill that would raise salaries for lawmakers and state commissioners as well as judges. 
 ''The governor has his own interests, commissioners basically, and we will do a comprehensive pay bill,'' the speaker said. ''He has trouble attracting people, and he's promised people raises. So I said I believe before too long he would send us a comprehensive bill. We've had a lot of discussions.''
 After Mr. Silver's interview, his spokesman, Dan Weiller, emphasized that the speaker had not told members that the governor would definitely submit a proposal by the end of February. When Mr. Silver discussed the matter with the legislators, Mr. Weiller said, he referred to the possibility that the amended raise might appear in amendments to the budget the governor's office traditionally submits within 21 days. 
 ''He was talking about the possibility it would be in the 21-day amendments, not that it would definitely happen by the end of February,'' Mr. Weiller said. ''Shelly was not specific about the time frame.''
 Because Mr. Silver is known in Albany for speaking cautiously, what pronouncements he does make are followed with intense interest in the capital.
 One Assembly Democrat, speaking on condition of anonymity because the meeting was closed, said of the speaker: ''The fact he told us must mean he's pretty confident about it.''
 A 24 percent pay increase for lawmakers, along the lines of the one proposed for judges, would cost the state more than $4 million a year.

HEADLINE: Bush and Congress Nearing a Deal on Stimulus

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Congressional leaders and the Bush administration were close to reaching a deal on a $145 billion economic stimulus package on Wednesday night as the Treasury Department crunched the numbers on components of the plan, senior House officials said. 
 Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California met three times Wednesday with Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. and the House Republican leader, Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, who have served as chief architects of the plan in a rare show of bipartisanship. 
 On her way into an evening meeting, Ms. Pelosi said there had been ''tremendous'' progress during the day. 
 ''I'm hopeful,'' she said. ''We're still working through.''
 Democrats said the centerpiece of the plan would be a widely distributed tax rebate, perhaps totaling as much as $96.5 billion or roughly two-thirds of the total amount President Bush has said is needed to help jumpstart the economy. Aides cautioned, however, that the numbers were the subject of intense negotiations. 
 Mr. Bush, after meeting on Wednesday with mayors from across the country, said he was optimistic about reaching swift agreement on a stimulus plan.
 ''I talked to them about my desire to work with the Congress to get a stimulus package passed, one that's going to be robust enough to affect the economy, simple enough for people to understand it and efficient enough to have an impact,'' Mr. Bush said. ''And I'm confident that we can get something done.'' 
 Democratic leaders said that to speed the economic rescue package they would mostly bypass the usual committee process. Lawmakers said that they hoped the plan could be approved by mid-February and that it would be sufficient to soften an economic downturn and forestall a recession. 
 ''One of the principal tenets of the administration and of ourselves is we have got to do this fast,'' Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the majority leader, said Wednesday. ''To go through the regular process and have hearings and have mark-ups and subcommittee mark-ups, obviously we would be to some degree twiddling our thumbs while the economy burns.'' 
 While Mr. Paulson, Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Boehner were the chief negotiators, other lawmakers have sought to take a strong hand in the process. 
 Representative Charles B. Rangel of New York, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, was said to be lobbying intensively for any payment to be sent to all low-income Americans, including those who did not pay any taxes last year. Some Republicans say benefits should be only for taxpayers. 
 In a statement Mr. Rangel said, ''We must follow the guidance of so many economists who have said, with great clarity, that this package must put money back into the hands of the middle- and lower-income families who will then spend it directly into our economy.'' 
 Democrats said the stimulus plan would also include benefits favored by many Republicans, including a depreciation incentive to encourage businesses to make capital investments this year. The plan may also allow businesses to spread operating losses incurred this year back over five years instead of the two years permitted under current law. 
 House Democrats said the plan would include an extension of unemployment benefits and a temporary increase in food stamp benefits, which many Democratic lawmakers have said are the two best-proven means of quickly stimulating the economy. 
 But there was still disagreement, particularly over a desire by some Republicans to include provisions that would delay components like the extension in unemployment insurance coverage until unemployment worsened to some predetermined level.
 Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts and the chairman of the Financial Services Committee, said the worldwide stock market declines this week and the move by the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point had made it clear that there should be no delay.
 ''The trigger has already been pulled,'' Mr. Frank said in an interview. 
 While the Ways and Means Committee has focused on the tax rebate and figuring out the quickest way to deliver the money, Mr. Frank and his committee have been developing a plan intended to avoid a huge increase in home foreclosures. The progress on the stimulus plan came as the Congressional Budget Office revised its economic projections to give a gloomier assessment of the economy, including a widening budget deficit and the first decline in corporate tax revenue since 2003.
 The grimmer outlook prompted Senator Kent Conrad of North Dakota, chairman of the Budget Committee, to declare that a short-term stimulus package was insufficient.
 ''In addition to developing a bipartisan stimulus package,'' Mr. Conrad said, ''we also must work together to tackle the long-term fiscal challenges we face with the coming retirement of the baby boom generation. The American people rightly expect that we will come together to address these two significant challenges.''
 House conservatives raised alarms about the emerging economic legislation, saying they feared it would focus too much on tax rebates and not enough on tax incentives to encourage businesses to create jobs. 
 They said any package should include provisions that would reduce the corporate tax rate, adjust capital gains for inflation and lower the capital gains rate for corporations.
 ''Giving temporary tax rebate checks to families, as important as that is, is not the same as economic growth,'' said Representative Jeb Hensarling of Texas, chairman of the Republican Study Committee. ''If you're going to have an economic stimulus package, it ought to contain some economic stimulus.''

HEADLINE: Giuliani Finds Snowbird Friends in Florida, but Is He Winning Over Voters?

BYLINE: By MICHAEL POWELL

DATELINE: ESTERO, Fla. 

 BODY:
America's Mayor, Mr. Leadership himself, has just bathed in the applause of 400 mostly white-haired, mostly transplanted Northeasterners and he is about to spend four or five hours dialing for the dollars needed to keep his presidential campaign going.
 Then he leans in to listen to a question from a television reporter: ''Mayor, you've had the state to yourself here in Florida for so long, for weeks,'' she says. ''Why is it that you seem to be losing support, not gaining support?'' 
 The eyes of Rudolph W. Giuliani pop wide. He tosses back his head and cackles in a manner not even vaguely suggestive of humor. What a crazy idea!
 ''I think the reality is that we are gaining support,'' he said. ''Our campaign is now in high gear.''
 Before another question can be asked, Mr. Giuliani says thank you, waves, pivots, kisses a startled baby and walks out a side door.
 Oh to be Hizzoner, the Republican candidate for president, in the sweaty adrenal days before the Florida primary that could decide his fate. Just last fall, Mr. Giuliani ruled the Republican field, guffawing with Brit Hume and Katie Couric, resting on his self-portrayal as Mr. 9/11 and the man who brought New York to heel.
 Then federal prosecutors indicted his friend and business partner, the former New York police commissioner Bernard B. Kerik. And a report revealed that police officers had served as bodyguards for Mr. Giuliani's girlfriend, Judith Nathan, who became his third wife shortly after he divorced his second wife. 
 Then Mr. Giuliani chose an unorthodox campaign strategy. He essentially skipped four early party caucuses and primaries. Iowa and South Carolina were seen as too loaded with Christian evangelicals, and New Hampshire was too friendly to Mitt Romney (or John McCain, as the case was). Nevada, too, seemed like Romney country.
 So Mr. Giuliani repaired to Florida and declared it his sunshine fortress, counting on lost tribes of New York snowbirds to rally to his banner. He rolled into more towns here than an itinerant insurance salesman. He talked hurricanes, Everglades, military bases, disaster insurance, talked pretty much anything on the mind of a Floridian.
 But his recent polling numbers in Florida have taken a precipitous dip, with one poll released Wednesday suggesting he had slipped to third place. And money has become a nagging worry, too; he took off much of Tuesday and Wednesday to dial donors.
 The former mayor's personal style makes few concessions to beach loafer casual. Here in Estero, on the Gulf Coast, he hops up to the stage looking a bit like a funeral director, in a black suit, a white shirt and a blue tie. He sports no hint of tan. His talking style is high-octane New York; he has a mocking sense of humor -- he favors a high-pitched voice to mimic the voice of liberals -- and very much enjoys using the first person singular. As in: 
 I am the only candidate to turn around an economy. I have dealt with disaster. I have tamed crime and welfare.
 As for a proposal submitted by a few congressmen to cut and simplify taxes?
 ''A lot of it is based on my ideas,'' Mr. Giuliani said. ''I would say I kind of sparked it.'' 
 His basic message has stayed consistent: He talks about ''Islamic terror''; on Tuesday he suggested that Florida with its hurricanes and New York with its terrorist attacks are brothers in disaster. And -- to big applause -- he offers that immigrants desiring citizenship must write and speak English. Perhaps undercutting this message, the Giuliani campaign has run Spanish-language advertisements to court the Cuban-American vote.
 A slog across Florida can sound like a stroll through Queens and Brooklyn. An elderly volunteer jerks her thumb at two friends. ''Me? I'm Forest Hills,'' she said. ''She's Ridgewood, and her at the end'' -- the woman waves -- ''she's a Gravesend girl.''
 Not every stop is adoring. Mr. Giuliani was an unyielding sort as mayor, and draws protesters as a cow does flies. In Palm Beach Gardens, he shakes hands with pastrami-chewing patrons at a deli. But when he steps outside, poster-waving Ron Paul fans yell that Mr. Giuliani is a fake, and abortion opponents come hopping over palm fronds, screaming that the reluctantly abortion-rights-supporting former mayor is the ''anti-Christ.''
 It's a perfectly lunatic storm, and Mr. Giuliani's toothy grin goes ear to ear. He seems most at ease when Florida has a New York moment. 
 Mr. Giuliani can make for an unpredictable campaigner. Last Sunday he had a fine rally going in Celebration, that ''Truman Show'' of a planned town in central Florida. He seemed to cut it off early -- to catch the Giants playoff game.
 The next day, his bus caravan made an unscheduled detour to the Daytona 500 Speedway.
 Revving the white Rudy-'08-mobile to considerable speed, his driver took the former mayor and his staff members for a precarious spin around the steeply sloped speedway. 
 His communications director yelled at an adviser to sit on the far side to balance the weight, and the bus speakers blared Mr. Giuliani's theme song, which sounds something like ''Hail to the Chief'' meets ''Rocky.'' Mr. Giuliani sat in the front, holding tight and grinning broadly.
 Afterward, he strolled into the pit and asked red-suited drivers how to crawl into the doorless cars. For a brilliant minute he seemed intent on trying it. Alas, photo-op sense prevailed -- there is little percentage in a front-page photo of a candidate's trousered legs kicking as he is stuck head-first in the car.
 Then he asked the drivers, not once but twice, if he could take a spin in a pace car. 
 No can do.
 Mr. Giuliani shrugged.
 ''We're all little boys,'' he said. ''You know that?''

HEADLINE: U.S. Policies Evoke Scorn at Davos

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER; Andrew Ross Sorkin contributed reporting.

DATELINE: DAVOS, Switzerland 

 BODY:
Over the years, the United States has fulfilled many roles at the World Economic Forum: dot-com dynamo, benevolent superpower, feared aggressor. Now add wounded giant.
 On the first day of the annual conference here, a parade of bankers, economists and government officials expressed deep fears about the faltering American economy -- and blunt criticism, particularly of the Federal Reserve, which some blame for sowing the seeds of today's crisis.
 For George Soros, the financier who made a fortune betting against the British pound, the slump now goes beyond subprime loans. It signals a reordering of the postwar economy and the end of dollar dominance. 
 ''The current crisis is not only the bust that follows the housing boom,'' Mr. Soros declared. ''It's basically the end of a 60-year period of continuing credit expansion based on the dollar as the reserve currency.'' 
 Suggestions of a new economic order abounded here: India's commerce and industry minister, Kamal Nath, said that China had overtaken the United States as his country's largest trading partner, buttressing his view that India could come through an American recession unscathed.
 The head of the National Bank of Kuwait, Ibrahim S. Dabdoub, said Americans who opposed sovereign wealth funds, like the one run by the Kuwaiti government, need to come to terms with the new reality.
 And an American economist, Nouriel Roubini, said bluntly, ''The United States looks like an emerging market,'' with large deficits and a weak currency. Brazil, an actual emerging market, had done a better job overhauling its economy, he said.
 Mr. Roubini, whose frequent predictions of a downturn have made him something of a soothsayer at Davos, said that the United States would suffer a recession lasting at least a year. He foresees a flood of defaults on car loans and corporate bonds, and a prolonged bear market.
 ''The debate is not whether we're going to have a soft landing or a hard landing,'' he said, as his audience squirmed. ''The question is only how hard the hard landing will be.''
 Several economists said the Federal Reserve seemed to have lost control of events since the subprime crisis erupted last summer. Some criticized its steep cut in interest rates Tuesday as a knee-jerk reaction to calm markets, rather than a reasoned response to a deteriorating situation.
 ''Policy makers are reaching back into the same playbook that got us into this mess,'' said Stephen S. Roach, the economist recently named chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia.
 Mr. Roach argued that the Fed, by signaling its readiness to cushion the stock market from the credit crisis, risked creating conditions for a new round of inflation in asset prices.
 Joseph E. Stiglitz, a Nobel Prize-winning economist, said the Fed ''made bad judgments'' and ''looked the other way when investment banks packaged bad loans in nontransparent ways.''
 He said the rate cut was too little too late, because monetary policy usually takes 6 to 18 months to have an impact.
 Not every one was grim. John W. Snow, the former Treasury secretary and chairman of Cerberus Capital Management, predicted that if the United States slipped into a recession, it would be ''short and shallow.''
 ''That's been the pattern of recessions in the U.S., and there's a reason for it,'' he said in an interview. ''There is an inherent resilience in the U.S. economy.'' Mr. Snow said there had already been an adjustment in housing prices and risk valuation.
 Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice picked up the theme of American economic resilience, saying that President Bush and Congress were negotiating an economic stimulus package that would help the United States remain an engine of global growth. 
 Despite the current weakness, few Americans here said the United States would resort to protectionist policies, even though it is an election year. Sovereign wealth funds, they noted, had taken multibillion-dollar stakes in giants like Citigroup and Merrill Lynch with hardly a peep of protest in Washington.
 ''Open investment is a critical driver of the U.S. economy,'' David H. McCormick, under secretary of the Treasury for international affairs, said. He added that it was reasonable to monitor sovereign wealth funds to make sure that they were commercially and not politically driven.
 The debate over ''decoupling,'' a once-popular idea that Europe and Asia could escape the effects of a recession in the United States because they are less reliant on American trade, seemed to be over before it started.
 Virtually everyone here agreed that an American downturn would spill over to Europe and Asia. Mr. Roach said China did not have a large enough domestic consumer market to replace a loss of demand for exports from American consumers.
 Officials from China agreed. ''The Chinese economy is entering quite a delicate stage,'' said Yu Yongding, an economist at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. ''We are facing a very bad situation in the U.S.''
 Only Mr. Nath of India said he was confident that his country would not feel a major effect from an American recession. India, he said, was far more driven than China by domestic demand.
 At least one specialist here professed to see a silver lining in the links between the world's major economies. C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said China and India would lift the United States out of its downturn. Companies like I.B.M., General Electric and Caterpillar already depend on these countries for a lot of their profits, Mr. Bergsten said.
 Adding a new term to the Davos lexicon, he said the United States would soon experience ''reverse coupling.''

HEADLINE: In Washington, Bloomberg Says Politics Is the Problem

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York City intensified his attacks on the political leadership here on Wednesday, pointing to what he called the government's failure to fix immigration policy and other problems of immediate concern to the nation. 
 In a speech before a group of his fellow mayors, Mr. Bloomberg described Washington politicians as shortsighted and said their priorities often reflected crass political calculations rather than sound policy judgments. 
 ''We all know that spending decisions in Washington are driven by whatever will attract votes and campaign cash,'' he said in criticizing the government for running up enormous budget deficits over the last few years.
 Mr. Bloomberg's comments come as he and his aides contemplate whether he should embark on a third-party presidential candidacy this year.
 While maintaining that he is not a candidate, Mr. Bloomberg offered a speech before the United States Conference of Mayors that was clearly intended to reinforce the notion that he represents a more pragmatic style of leadership distinct from the partisanship of Washington. 
 For example, he told his audience that he had recently joined a nonpartisan coalition of mayors and governors that planned to advocate for less politically motivated federal spending on highways, roads, bridges and other infrastructure.
 ''The problem isn't that we're not investing enough in infrastructure,'' said Mr. Bloomberg, who recently became an independent after leaving the Republican Party. ''It's that we're investing badly. It's time we start spending on the infrastructure America needs, not the pork-barrel projects politicians want.''
 He was also critical of the economic stimulus package that is currently being negotiated by Congress and the White House. That package is expected to include tax rebates that policymakers hope will encourage spending that would, in turn, help jump-start the economy.
 But Mr. Bloomberg called that approach shortsighted and argued that the stimulus package should include help for homeowners who are facing foreclosure. ''The most important and immediate economic relief we can offer is to help people who are in danger of losing their homes stay in their homes,'' he said. ''What good is a rebate going to do for a family who is about to lose their home?''
 He also used the speech to rebuke Congress for failing to enact a new immigration policy that would secure the nation's borders and ensure that businesses have access to skilled and unskilled workers from abroad. ''Illegal immigration has become the pandering politician's best friend,'' he said.

HEADLINE: A Fear That the Cure Could Be Poison

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Even as the Federal Reserve grapples with the collapse of a speculative bubble in housing -- the second speculative bust in less than a decade -- is it at risk of repeating recent mistakes?
 One day after the Fed slashed its benchmark interest rate to head off a possible recession, a small minority of economists warned on Wednesday that the central bank was in danger of invoking the same remedies that it did after the bubble in dot-com stocks burst seven years ago.
 Though most experts agree that the economy is on the brink of a recession, and some even contend the recession has already begun, critics say the Fed's attempted rescue looks uncomfortably similar to the aggressive rate reductions that aggravated the speculative bubble in housing. 
 ''We've literally forgotten that this is the very policy environment that led to the housing and mortgage problems in the first place,'' said Michael T. Darda, an economist at MKM Partners, an investment firm in Greenwich, Conn. ''We're not going to see another housing bubble, but we could see more inflation.'' 
 Beyond the danger of higher inflation, some analysts warn that the Federal Reserve and its chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, could also lose credibility by appearing to act in knee-jerk response to plunging stock prices.
 ''They risk being seen as bailing out equity investors,'' wrote Adam S. Posen, deputy director of the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. ''It makes it look as though stock market fears are driving the Fed to action.''
 There are few signs yet of rising inflation, while the evidence is increasing that American economic growth has slowed to a crawl. Because a cooling economy usually damps inflation by reducing demand for goods and services, Fed officials are now far more worried about a painful slowdown than about inflation.
 But other central banks are not following the Fed's lead. Jean-Claude Trichet, president of the European Central Bank, strongly hinted on Wednesday that European policy makers would keep their benchmark rate unchanged.
 ''Particularly in demanding times of significant market correction and turbulences, it is the responsibility of the central bank to solidly anchor inflation expectations to avoid additional volatility,'' Mr. Trichet told the European Parliament in Brussels. The Bank of England is not expected to reduce rates quickly either.
 European central bankers face challenges that are different from those the Fed confronts. Few European countries have a housing collapse even remotely comparable to that in the United States, though many European banks are suffering big losses on their holdings of American mortgage-backed securities. 
 But Mr. Trichet's comments sent a chill through stock markets on both sides of the Atlantic on Wednesday. Stock prices in the United States endured another day of brutal swings, swooning badly in the morning and early afternoon and then skyrocketing back up at the end of the day. The Dow Jones industrial average closed up nearly 300 points. 
 For Mr. Bernanke, the biggest risk now is that financial markets will become paralyzed by fear and that investors, corporations and consumers will pull back on their investing and spending, setting in motion a spiral of economic decline.
 Many economists argue that Fed policy makers were entirely justified in reducing the overnight Federal funds rate by three-quarters of a percentage point on Tuesday, to 3.5 percent, and investors are betting that the Fed will lower the short-term rate another half of a point at a policy meeting next week.
 ''Credit conditions have not gotten any easier,'' said Robert J. Barbera, chief economist at ITG Hoenig, an economic forecasting firm. Because of the continuing anxiety about soured mortgages and the need for banks to keep large volumes of loans on their own balance sheets, Mr. Barbera said, the credit crisis is extending beyond subprime mortgages to many kinds of business borrowers.
 But there are hints that the Fed's rush to reduce interest rates has already had a slight impact on inflation expectations.
 Mr. Bernanke and other Fed officials contend that inflation expectations are crucial to the actual course of inflation. Fed officials closely scrutinize two measures of popular expectations. 
 One, the University of Michigan's monthly survey of consumers, offers reassuring evidence that consumers' long-run expectations have not changed much, even though consumers do expect higher prices over the next year or two -- a reflection of concern about higher energy prices.
 The other measure is the difference between the prices of normal Treasury securities and an inflation-adjusted type, known as Treasury inflation-protected securities, or TIPS. The difference in prices is thought to reflect investors' expectations about inflation. 
 Brian Sack, senior economist at Macroeconomic Advisers in Washington, said the premium on inflation-protected five-year Treasury securities widened slightly after the Fed announced its rate cut on Tuesday. The increase was small, to 2.52 percent from 2.47 percent, and Mr. Sack cautioned that it could simply reflect market noise. But he said the implicit inflation premium was at the upper range of its level in the past two years.
 ''One of the risks inherent in aggressive easing is the possibility of dislodging inflation expectations,'' Mr. Sack said. 
 Mr. Posen of the Peterson economics institute predicted that the Fed's new policy of lower interest rates would provide ''too much rather than too little stimulus'' and help push inflation noticeably higher in 2009 and 2010. 
 But Mr. Posen added that the Fed was facing undeniable pressures to act decisively against a potentially serious downturn. 
 Mr. Bernanke and other Fed officials are well aware of the risks, and of criticism by some experts that the Fed's cheap-money policies from 2001 to 2004 may have aggravated the bubble in housing.
 Indeed, Mr. Bernanke resisted demands from Wall Street to reduce interest rates faster. As recently as three weeks ago, the Federal Reserve's official stance was that the risks of slowing growth were still roughly balanced against the risk of higher inflation.
 If the Fed continues to lower interest rates, as many Wall Street analysts predict, Mr. Bernanke is nonetheless likely to absorb as many lessons as possible from its experience after the dot-com bubble burst. 
 Frederic S. Mishkin, a Fed governor with close ties to Mr. Bernanke, suggested in a speech in August what one of those lessons might be. If housing prices plunged, Mr. Mishkin said, the Fed should cut rates quickly and substantially. But once the economy begins to recover, he continued, the Fed should raise them back to normal almost as quickly.

HEADLINE: Bank of America to Sell $6 Billion in New Shares

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The Bank of America Corporation announced on Wednesday that it planned to raise $6 billion by selling preferred shares, one day after reporting a 95 percent decline in quarterly profit. 
 The chief financial officer, Joe L. Price, said on Tuesday that the bank planned to raise capital soon to shore up its Tier-1 capital ratio, which measures its ability to cover losses.
 He said raising capital would help the bank absorb its $21 billion purchase of the LaSalle Bank Corporation from ABN Amro Holding, and its pending $4 billion acquisition of the Countrywide Financial Corporation, the mortgage lender.
 Bank of America said Wednesday that it planned to sell perpetual preferred shares convertible into stock, and perpetual preferred shares without a conversion feature. Perpetual shares do not have any maturity date.
 The bank intends to use net proceeds for general corporate purposes. Its own bankers are arranging the offerings.
 Bank of America ended 2007 with a Tier-1 ratio of 6.87 percent, down from 8.22 percent on Sept. 30. The ratio is above the 6 percent that regulators say reflects a ''well capitalized'' bank, but is below the bank's 8 percent target.
 Also on Wednesday, Sovereign Bancorp, the savings and loan, said it posted a $1.6 billion quarterly loss and canceled its dividend after a larger-than-expected write-down for consumer credit losses and a 2006 bank acquisition.
 The fourth-quarter net loss equaled $3.34 a share, and compared with a loss of $129 million, or 28 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Operating profit, excluding charges, fell 44 percent, to $94 million, or 18 cents a share, from $167 million, or 33 cents, a year earlier, Sovereign, which is based in Philadelphia, said.
 Analysts on average expected profit of 16 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Forecasts by analysts typically exclude one-time items.
 Sovereign canceled its 8-cents-a-share quarterly dividend ''to help bolster capital and mitigate risk during the ongoing challenges in the financial services industry,'' the chief executive, Joseph P. Campanelli, said in a statement. 
 Sovereign wrote down $1.58 billion of good will, or $3.08 a share, which was $180 million more than it estimated last week. It attributed the increase to interest rate changes that affected its consumer and New York-area operations.
 Part of the write-down reflected weakness in consumer lending, which has been hurt by deteriorating credit and a decision to halt auto loans in states in the Southeast and Southwest. The rest covered New York operations, which consist largely of the former Independence Community Bank Corporation.

HEADLINE: U.S. Envoy Wants Political Pact in Kenya

BYLINE: By JEFFREY GETTLEMAN

DATELINE: NAIROBI, Kenya 

 BODY:
The American ambassador to Kenya said Wednesday that his deepest worries about the postelection crisis here were not about Kenyans rampaging in the streets or killing one another because of ethnic hatreds, both of which have claimed hundreds of lives. 
 Possibly even more dangerous, he said, were the deep rifts among the country's opposing politicians, who seem ''entrenched'' and surrounded by ''hard-liners.'' 
 ''You can never underestimate the ability of just a couple of people to tear a place apart,'' said Michael E. Ranneberger, the ambassador, during an interview at his home in Nairobi, the capital. 
 He said his chief concern was whether Mwai Kibaki, the president, and Raila Odinga, the top opposition leader, were ''prepared to rise above themselves and put the interests of the nation ahead of their own personal or their group's political interest.''
 ''That is still an unanswered question,'' he said.
 The politicians need to sit down and compromise, the ambassador added, because ''we're in the middle of a very serious crisis.'' 
 It has been four weeks since Kenyans went to the polls in record numbers, and the country is still reeling from the aftershocks of a disputed tally in which Mr. Kibaki was declared the winner over Mr. Odinga, despite widespread evidence of vote rigging. The Kenyan government has said that more than 650 people have been killed, though Western diplomats and aid workers say the death toll is several hundred higher.
 On Wednesday, Kofi Annan, the former United Nations secretary general, met with Mr. Odinga and persuaded him to call off another round of protests that had been scheduled for Thursday. Mr. Annan was also supposed to meet with Mr. Kibaki, but the president postponed the get-together until Thursday and chose instead to meet with Yoweri Museveni, Uganda's president and a close political ally who is pushing his own peace plan. 
 So far, Mr. Kibaki and Mr. Odinga have said they are willing to negotiate, but neither has offered substantial concessions, despite pleas from Kenyans and other African dignitaries. The two men have yet to talk face to face.
 Mr. Annan, who arrived on Tuesday, seems to have created more buzz and hope than any visitors involved in the previous mediation efforts. 
 ''I think everybody knows that if this mission fails, there are no others in the offing,'' said Salim Lone, a spokesman for the opposition. The stakes are clearly high. Killings driven by ethnic strife continue in the Rift Valley, one of Kenya's most scenic provinces but also the most violent because of historic tensions over land that have been ignited by the election controversy. On Wednesday, two more people were killed there by poison arrows. 
 In Nairobi, street clashes are becoming the norm. A funeral on Wednesday degenerated into a riot. Opposition protesters pelted cars with stones and set a government building on fire. Last week, protesters sabotaged a crucial railway line running to Uganda. It is still out of commission.
 The violence has been a mix of ethnically driven killings, fighting in Nairobi's slums and battles between the police and protesters. Mr. Ranneberger, who has been ambassador here for about a year and a half, said he was ''outraged'' when he saw television reports last week showing what appeared to be a police officer shooting an unarmed demonstrator. The protester had been dancing in the street and making faces when one officer leveled an assault rifle and shot him at close range. The officer, who is under investigation, was then shown on television kicking the protester, who later died.
 Mr. Ranneberger said the fighting, even in the Rift Valley, was not purely ethnic but ''politically, economically and socially motivated,'' stemming from tensions over land and the perception that Mr. Kibaki's ethnic group, the Kikuyu, had marginalized others. He said the violence in the Rift Valley after the election appeared to have been organized because of the involvement of large numbers of heavily armed men who seemed to strike just minutes after the disputed results were announced.
 Mr. Ranneberger said the American government, which gives more than $600 million in aid to Kenya annually, was frustrated at the political impasse but was not at the stage where it was ready to cut assistance.
 ''It's counterproductive,'' he said. ''And it's way too premature to talk about anything punitive.''
 The way forward, he said, was for the Kenyan government to be more inclusive and to address the long-simmering grievances over economic and political inequality. He also said officials should investigate the postelection violence and fix Kenya's election system, which has been badly discredited by the balloting on Dec. 27.
 ''I really am fundamentally optimistic about the future of the country,'' he said, citing Kenya's strong middle class, its high literacy rates and its independent media. ''There are all sorts of reasons why Kenya can overcome this.''
