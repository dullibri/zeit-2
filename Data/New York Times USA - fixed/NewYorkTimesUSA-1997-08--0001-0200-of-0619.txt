HEADLINE: Human Rights Treaty Deserves Criticism

 BODY:

To the Editor:
While Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's allegation of a conspiracy by the financier George Soros to attack Malaysia's currency would indeed appear to be misplaced (news article, July 29), Dr. Mahathir's call for a retooling of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights is reasonable.
With some articles vague to the point of meaninglessness and others "entitling" people to more rights than those enjoyed in the most progressive nations, the declaration was flawed from the beginning. More important, the United States has itself never been in compliance with the treaty. 
 For example, its unemployed and underemployed citizens may want to consider pushing for enforcement of Article 23, which guarantees work, protection from unemployment and "equal pay for equal work."
Overworked Americans may be interested in reviewing Article 24, guaranteeing "rest and leisure." Millions of homeless Americans ought to press for fulfillment of Article 25, which not only requires governments to provide food, clothing, housing and medical care to their citizens but also calls for these items to be bundled into a guaranteed "standard of living."

HEADLINE: As Bonn Fails at Tax Reform, German Businesses Study U.S.

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: NEUSTADT-WIED, Germany, July 31

 BODY:
The timing was a coincidence, but no less telling for that: just as United States lawmakers were preening over legislation to balance the budget and cut taxes, German politicians acknowledged failure early today in negotiations to streamline their land's burdensome system of taxation.
For people like Ralf Riba, who runs a small design company here that has taken an American cue -- not only by marketing 6 foot tall, 100 pound steel representations of the Empire State Building, but also by downsizing its staff and outsourcing work -- the implications were obvious. 
 "Medium-sized companies are still the motor of the German economy," he said. "And this has put the brakes on."
Indeed, across a spectrum from industry representatives to Government ministers, the assessment was gloomy. "The chance to make Germany more attractive in the international race for investment was frittered away," said the Economics Minister, Gunther Rexrodt.
Neither was the comparison with Washington lost on commentators.
"Two worlds," said the Frankfurter Allgemeine, a conservative daily. "With pragmatic common sense, the Americans presented themselves with a reduction of capital taxes to keep their economy on the upswing; in Germany, a tax reform that would have offered a realistic chance to the unemployed has collapsed on ideological divisions."
The German tax reform, which Chancellor Helmut Kohl labeled "the reform of the century," centered on a Government proposal to cut $16 billion worth of taxes, in part by lowering the top-end income tax rate from 53 percent to 39 percent and the starting rate from 25.9 percent to 15 percent. The Government proposal also foresaw a reduction of an income tax surcharge for the staggering costs of German reunification from 7.5 to 5.5 percent.
The aim was to encourage investment and thus stimulate jobs in an economy where unemployment exceeds one million people, or 11 percent of the work force.
The opposition Social Democrats, with a majority both in the upper house of Parliament and on the mediation committee that met for 15 hours on Wednesday, blocked the package, saying its terms favored the rich. Not only that, the opposition's own counterproposal to lower Germany's prohibitive labor costs in return for increases in the value-added tax and the fuel tax now seems certain to be voted down by the Government majority in the lower house.
The result: political paralysis and, according to Arnold Willemsen, a spokesman for the Federal Association of Germany Industry, "catastrophic implications" for Germany's record-level unemployment and "a signal to German investors to take their money abroad and to foreign investors to avoid Germany even more."
For Mr. Riba, 29, in his design office in this leafy backwater 25 miles south of Bonn, the tribulations seemed ominously familiar: It was a combination of high costs and global pressures that turned his family's business from a substantial manufacturer of clothing-industry machinery employing 70 workers to a modest studio with just two full-time employees -- a parable of German costs and complacency at a time of global economic change.
When its American marketing partner pulled out under disputed circumstances two and a half years ago, Mr. Riba said the company, founded in 1947, was left to fend for itself in a world that had changed radically.
The company's patented machinery designs, it turned out, had been copied in Poland and Greece, Mr. Riba said in an interview. The clothing industry had moved away from Germany because of high labor costs to places where it was cheaper -- Romania, Turkey, the former Yugoslavia and parts of southeast Asia.
"As Germans, we had been so arrogant," Mr. Riba said. "We ranked No. 2 in the world as exporters. But we lost sight of the world market and realized too late that our competitors had not been sitting still."
When the banks demanded repayment of loans worth some $800,000, the company -- Dipl. Ing. Riba G.m.b.H. -- was left with 26 full-time employees it could not afford to dismiss because of the high severance pay mandated by German law.
It declared bankruptcy last September, sold off manufacturing plants and office buildings and was reborn this year as Ralf Riba Design, with one small workshop, one rented design studio and two full-time employees -- Mr. Riba and an assistant. Start-up cost: $30,000.
Although Mr. Riba has never visited the United States, his formula seems a microcosm of American economic restructuring. In a land where social contributions devour 40 percent of gross salaries, he employs a designer and technical staff as freelancers so that he does not have to pay those outlays. Rather than maintain costly work space, Mr. Riba subcontracts labor to four independent shops.
"We don't want mass markets," he said. "We want niche markets for new ideas." Apart from the Empire State Building look-alikes, about 100 of which have been sold as decorative objects or CD racks for around $1,200 each, his company also produces a device to measure the conductivity of building materials, costing roughly $80,000 each. The future, he said, is in high-tech innovation.
Such thinking might be profitable in the United States. But in Germany, steep taxes and the world's highest labor costs inhibit companies like Mr. Riba's that simply are not big enough to transfer production plants abroad, as many bigger German companies have.
"It's worse for small companies than big ones," said Mr. Willemsen of the Federal Association of German Industry. "The big firms have made their investments abroad and even the bigger medium-sized firms have begun to move abroad. The smaller firms find this difficult. They stay here and remain under the tax-yoke. For them, there's no relief."

HEADLINE: Unexpected Fall In Jobless Claims

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 31

 BODY:
The number of workers applying for state unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell last week to the lowest level in more than 23 years, in a sign the United States job market continues to power ahead, Labor Department figures showed today.
First-time jobless claims fell 22,000, to a seasonally adjusted 277,000, in the week that ended last Saturday. In the previous week, claims declined 42,000, to 299,000. The latest figure was the lowest since Jan. 5, 1974, when claims stood at 269,000. Analysts had expected jobless claims to rise by 1,000 last week, to 300,000. 
 The four-week average for new jobless claims, a less volatile gauge of employment conditions than weekly numbers, fell to 325,750 from 340,750 the previous week.
Last week's decline could reflect quirks in adjusting claims for seasonal variations in the job market, a Labor Department spokesman said.

HEADLINE: Rescuing the District of Columbia

 BODY:
The District of Columbia's faltering aspirations to govern itself took a severe blow this week when Congress and the White House agreed to bail out the nation's capital from its financial crisis but at a stiff political price. The agreement would strip Washington D.C.'s Mayor, Marion S. Barry Jr., and its City Council of many powers and turn them over to a financial control board that was created by Congress two years ago to handle an earlier fiscal debacle. Stripping elected officials of duties is always regrettable. But Congress could not turn over hundreds of millions of dollars to a city administration that is as incompetent as Marion Barry's.
The District's own (non-voting) representative in Congress, Eleanor Holmes Norton, was an author of the agreement and embraces many of its provisions. Those who wish the District well can only hope that the control board succeeds in putting the District on firm financial footing quickly, so that political control can be returned to the elected officials who should rightly wield it. 
 The District's huge financial shortfall is largely due to reasons beyond its control. Over 40 percent of its land is occupied by the Federal Government, which pays no taxes and makes only limited contributions instead. Congress also forbids the District to tax commuters, with the result that most of the income earned in the District goes untaxed and the whole tax burden falls on a relatively poor population. Unlike other cities, the District has no state government to pitch in and help out. Its population of transient politicians and suburban commuters provides skimpy community leadership.
But it is also true that the Barry administration and its predecessor were glaringly inept. A recent series in The Washington Post showed a city that suffers high rates of tuberculosis and other diseases, yet cannot figure out how to spend $90 million of available Federal grants to ameliorate the problems. The poor live in dilapidated housing, yet city agencies sit on tens of millions of dollars in unspent Federal housing grants. The city wastes hundreds of millions of dollars each year because it fails to collect taxes due or require competitive bids on city contracts. Over all, the city hires more workers and spends more money per resident than does any other city, yet potholes go unfilled and the fire department has limped along with just one of its 16 ladder trucks in working condition.
The new agreement would have the Federal Government take over a $5 billion pension shortfall and pay for the courts, a prison and some other parts of the criminal justice system. It would pump about $170 million more each year into the city's Medicaid program and grant residents and businesses large tax cuts. Next year alone the agreement would provide over $200 million in relief for the city. Over five years, the city will get almost $1 billion in additional aid. In return, Congress exacted stern measures of accountability. It gave more control to an already powerful financial control board, which will now control hiring for most city agencies. The board will also send in experts to overhaul the management of city agencies.
It is not possible to discuss the accord without tackling the problem of race. For decades the residents of the District, a majority of whom are black, were governed by Congressional committees run by Southern whites. Resentment remains, and Mayor Barry is tapping into it with charges that the agreement amounts to "recolonization." But the victims of the city's pathetic performance are its black as well as white residents.
Congress voted limited home rule for the District in 1973, and the District elected its first Mayor two years later. The new agreement does not so much trash the principle of home rule as bend it. The Mayor is kept in office and not in effect replaced with a city manager, as many in Congress proposed. But if control is returned to elected officials at the first possible moment, the agreement can be welcomed because it gives hope that the District will be a better place to live tomorrow than it is today.

Seven-Building Apartment Project Would End Rental Drought in Fort Lee

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
A 351-unit apartment complex that will begin rising this fall a mile from the George Washington Bridge in Fort Lee, N.J, will be the first new rental project in the community in 25 years. It is also the latest in a string of upscale rental projects its developer has built in the New York metropolitan area in the last eight years.
The developer, Avalon Properties of Wilton, Conn., with offices in Princeton, N.J., has 4,572 apartments in 13 properties in the region and 5,800 more apartments in 19 developments under way or planned. 
 Jeffrey B. Albert, an Avalon vice president, said his company concentrates solely on rentals. "While the overall housing market in the metropolitan area is tight," he said, "rentals do well on both sides of the economic picture because, whether by choice or necessity, people will rent."
The apartments at the Fort Lee project, Avalon Crest, will be in seven four-story buildings on 13 acres along Executive Drive, just off Route 4. They will have one to three bedrooms and 725 to 1,300 square feet of space, and some will have lofts. Rents will range from $1,300 to $2,200 a month.
Avalon was drawn to the site for several reasons. "It is one of the last large fallow pieces of land in the borough and is blessed with access to major highways and employment centers," Mr. Albert said. "It is also in a solid market where there is a dearth of rentals."
Avalon Crest will rise over the next two years on land originally planned for a 30-story office tower, part of a 600,000-square-foot, two-building office park. Avalon is under contract to buy the site for $9.5 million from the park's owner and expects to close on the purchase in November when construction is to start, Mr. Albert said.
Avalon, which became a real estate investment trust four years ago, enabling it to raise money through stock offerings, is financing the $54 million project. Prior to 1993, the company's executives were partners with Trammell Crow Residential, a development firm in Atlanta.
Fort Lee has many high-rise residential towers atop the cliffs of the Palisades. It was a focus of the conversion frenzy of the late 1970's and early 1980's when many of its rental units were converted into condominiums and cooperatives. Of the 11,000 housing units in the borough, there are just 1,000 rental apartments.
Large-scale rental construction is limited in most of New Jersey. Among the reasons are zoning constraints, the scarcity and high cost of land, and public resistance. Another factor is that rent control ordinances are in place in 115 of the state's 566 municipalities.
An exception to that pattern in the 18-mile Hudson River shoreline, where some 2,682 residences, most of them rentals, are under way or about to begin. Among them are a 276-unit project in West New York and two rental building totaling 786 units at Newport, the huge mixed-use center in Jersey City.
Getting the Avalon Crest site rezoned from commercial to residential use took a year and a half of negotiation with the borough and with the owners of Linwood Park, a 1,170-unit cooperative complex next to the new project.
Avalon initially proposed its new rental to include 525 apartments in three 10- to 14-story buildings. That design "would have boxed us in," said Michael W. Sanitmauro, president of the board of directors at Linwood Park, adding that the taller buildings would have blocked views and hurt property values.
Scaling back the project to its current size and moving the buildings farther away from their border with Linwood Park addresses those issues and "satisfies the needs of both parties," Mr. Sanitmauro said.
The rental vacancy rate is under 5 percent in Fort Lee, where the inventory also includes condominium and some cooperative apartments rented out by their owners, said Charles Oppler, a partner at Oppler-Ketive Realtors, a brokerage in Fort Lee. Even with new rental construction in the nearby waterfront town of Edgewater, the demand for rentals exceeds the supply, he said.
Consistent with its other developments, Avalon is designing the Fort Lee project with open apartment layouts and a high degree of amenities, from on-site management to recreation, Mr. Albert said.
All the apartments at Avalon Crest will have washers and dryers, and some will have fireplaces. Among the planned amenities are a club house, swimming pool and children's play area. There will also be garage and surface parking. Leasing will begin next summer, Mr. Albert said.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
A Warning Light Largely Ignored in Thai Currency Crisis

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS 

 BODY:
The plunge in the Thai baht, followed by a wave of currency depreciations through South and Southeast Asia, illustrates the shortcomings of the international early-warning system set up after the Mexican peso crisis of 1994-95 to head off currency upheavals in emerging economies.
Over the last year, officials say, Thailand steadfastly resisted pressure from the International Monetary Fund and Western governments to take new steps to curb its current-account deficit, raise productivity, reduce short-term foreign borrowing and strengthen a creaky banking industry weighed down by speculative property loans. 
 In the meantime, foreign bankers and investors continued to pour money into the country, even though they knew that Thailand had an estimated $60 billion of foreign debt falling due but only $40 billion in foreign-exchange reserves.
Even after speculative pressure started building against the baht around February, Thailand refused to apply new economic measures or to seek I.M.F. assistance, saying that it could weather the storm with help from Asian neighbors.
And even after it was forced to effectively devalue the baht on July 2 -- by allowing it to float to market levels -- Bangkok waited until this past Monday before reluctantly accepting that the only way to restore confidence in its currency was to ask for an I.M.F. loan and accept whatever economic disciplines were imposed.
"Frankly, the early-warning system failed," said C. Fred Bergsten, a former Under Secretary of the Treasury, who heads the Institute for International Economics in Washington. "The Thais did not listen to the fund and the markets were very slow to send Bangkok warning signals, even though they knew there was trouble coming. The I.M.F. and the Group of Seven countries should have really put the heat on the Thais."
While pleased that Thailand has finally agreed to put its economy under their supervision, senior officials of the monetary fund remain angry that their warnings went unheeded so long and that officials in Bangkok refused to cooperate with the elaborate procedures put in place after the Mexican debacle.
In a speech in Jakarta in November, the I.M.F.'s managing director, Michel Camdessus, warned that despite high growth rates, Southeast Asian countries faced "new challenges and risks" to their economic and financial stability.
"It had no effect beyond making the Asians angry," said a senior I.M.F. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "They thought they could manage on their own.
Then in June, after a highly critical review of its economic policies by the I.M.F. executive board, Thailand refused to allow publication of an account of the discussion under a procedure instituted the previous month intended to let financial markets know more quickly where the fund sees trouble brewing.
"That should tell you something: the Thais thumbed their nose at us all along," the I.M.F. official added, noting that the Thai delegation sent to Tokyo right after the devaluation returned empty-handed because Japan refused to help unless the Thais called in the monetary fund.
Under the early-warning system, emerging economies were urged to provide markets with much more information than in the past about their economic performance. At the first hint of trouble, the reasoning went, well-informed bankers would press them to take new measures or seek I.M.F. help.
At the same time, the fund vowed to increase its surveillance, keeping a hawk-like lookout for signs of weakness that could undermine their creditworthiness and cause a Mexican-style outflow of capital.
The I.M.F. also set up a World Wide Web site where countries can post their latest financial statistics. It arranged a big new pool of lendable funds to finance future bailouts, and streamlined its lending procedures so borrowers could get credit more quickly.
It began publishing background papers on economies it is monitoring to keep markets better informed. And in May it agreed to release the results of these economic checkups, as long as the country agreed.
Such precautions reflected a perception that the Mexican crash represented a new type of financial crisis, one closely linked to the globalization of markets. In this new world, flood tides of speculative capital could flow in and out of emerging economies, playing havoc with their development and sending shock waves out to foreign lenders and investors.
Thailand, along with some other Southeast Asian countries, was vulnerable to devaluation because it had linked its currency to the dollar as a way of limiting inflation. But as the dollar rose, these export-dependent economies lost their competitiveness.
Once the baht fell, other regional currencies became candidates for devaluation, as well. Speculative pressures quickly forced down the Philippine peso, the Malaysian ringgit, the Indonesian rupiah and even the mighty Singapore dollar.
"The rest of the region had to re-establish its competitiveness against Thailand," said Kermit L. Schoenholtz, the Salomon Brothers chief economist based in London.
While Thailand delayed approaching the I.M.F. after it devalued, the Philippines, whose economy was already under I.M.F. surveillance, moved quickly to negotiate a new $650 million loan with the fund and to take additional economic measures.
Last week, the I.M.F. sought to assure investors that the wave of devaluations did not spell the end of the Asian economic miracle. The strong growth record of these countries, it said, leaves these countries able to ride out a currency crisis.
"We don't see the underlying adjustment that has to be made in any of these economies as anywhere like what had to be done in Mexico," Stanley Fischer, the fund's deputy managing director, said in the first official comment on the Asian currency losses.
Mr. Schoenholtz agrees, saying: "These countries retain impressive fundamentals -- including high savings rates, flexible labor forces, natural resources and now a more competitive exchange rate. Growth will return."
I.M.F. officials warn that they are likely to recommend a much greater dose of austerity for Thailand than they imposed on the Philippines, though they still hope that the Thai economy will record some growth this year and avoid the 6.2 percent contraction Mexico underwent the year after it devalued.

Dollar Is Mostly Higher
(By The Associated Press) -- The dollar recovered from an early selloff to end mostly higher yesterday.
It gained in European trading after the Dutch central bank left a key interest rate unchanged. The move reinforced a view that interest rates in Europe were likely to remain low because of sluggish economies and high unemployment. That view was bolstered by a French Government report that the June jobless rate had risen to 12.6 percent from 12.5 percent in May.
The dollar increased further in New York trading when the Commerce Department reported that the economy grew in the second quarter at an annual rate of 2.2 percent, stronger than expected.
The dollar rose to 118.59 Japanese yen, from 118.57 yen on Wednesday, and to 1.8384 German marks from 1.8370 marks. The British pound rallied broadly, indirectly helping the dollar against the yen and the mark. The pound rose to $1.6420 from $1.6287.
The gains came as the Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported that United States monetary authorities did not intervene in foreign-exchange markets in the three-month period ending on June 30. It was the seventh consecutive quarter that the Government had not bought or sold currencies on the market.

HEADLINE: THE BUDGET DEAL: DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA;
Local Governing in Capital to Be Transformed

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 31

 BODY:
The budget bill passed by Congress today will profoundly change the governing of the nation's capital, taking away much of the mayor's powers in exchange for nearly $1 billion in new Federal aid over the next five years.
With those provisions of the bill, Federal lawmakers have stepped into the debate over one of the most contentious issues facing the city: the degree to which local residents should have direct control over their fortunes. For now, it will not be much. 
 In reclaiming control of city operations and giving it to the financial control board created by Congress two years ago to oversee the District's budget, the lawmakers have demonstrated that for the time being, they have little confidence in the ability of local elected officials to stanch years of fiscal bleeding and population decline that have badly eroded the tax base.
That shift of authority has reopened an emotional debate among many residents over whether they enjoy the same democracy as other Americans. In the process, it has put some distance between the two Democrats who are the city's leading political figures: Eleanor Holmes Norton, the District's nonvoting delegate to Congress, who helped shape the final deal with White House negotiators and Republican leaders, and Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr., who harshly criticized it as a "recolonization" of the city in diminishing limited home rule granted by Congress 23 years ago.
Under the new legislation, the Federal Government will create tax breaks for the District's residents and businesses, will assume the city's $4.9 billion pension liability and will take over typical state functions like running courts and prisons. The Government will also increase its share of Medicaid costs, to 70 percent from the current 50 percent.
Over five years, according to the White House Office of Management and Budget, the deal is worth $928 million beyond what the District would have received from the Government under the current relationship.
But in exchange for the package of benefits, the city is being required to yield more managerial power to the control board.
The bill will allow the board to send private consultants into the city's nine major agencies to identify problems and impose solutions; the consultants will be accountable only to the board, not to the mayor or the city council. In addition, the mayor's nominations for department heads will require the board's approval.
The changes are temporary, remaining in effect only as long as the board itself operates. But by law, the board can disband only after the city has balanced its budget for four consecutive years.
Ms. Norton said the transfer of these powers to the board had been the only way to prevent an even more radical change: the creation of a city-manager-type government that would have all but eliminated any mayoral power. That change was favored by Senator Lauch Faircloth, the North Carolina Republican who is chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee for the District of Columbia.
For now, the mayor will still have authority over some city agencies, including the economic development office, the taxi commission and the office of tourism and promotion.
"It is a major victory for home rule that I was able to avoid the imposition of a Congressionally imposed city manager," Ms. Norton said in a statement. "However, during the process, provisions were forced into the bill requiring the mayor to share some of his authority with the control board."
Mr. Barry, who is regarded by some Federal lawmakers as the prime source of the District's problems, was outraged by the deal. He lashed out at "mean-spirited, conservative and anti-self-determination Republicans" who had insisted on tight managerial restraints on local officials in return for the tax breaks, sought by Ms. Norton, and the Federal assistance for municipal operations, proposed by President Clinton.
In language that was particularly charged in a city with a majority black population, Mr. Barry said:
"Recolonization is being promoted by several key members of the Republican Party. To take power from local elected officials is taking away the rights of 600,000 citizens of the District of Columbia and denying them their God-given and constitutional rights to help decide their fate and their freedom."
He singled out Mr. Faircloth, saying the Senator "led the effort to recolonize the citizens of the District" and "raped democracy and freedom."
For his part, the Senator referred to his appointment as chairman of the District subcommittee seven months ago, recalling that he recognized then that "the largest problem was mismanagement."
"Everything I've seen as chairman," he added, "has only confirmed that belief."

HEADLINE: Growth Eased To 2.2% Rate In 2d Quarter

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 31

 BODY:
The economy slowed during the spring as consumers cut back on their spending, Government figures showed today.
The economy grew at an annual rate of 2.2 percent in the April-June period, less than half that of the preceding quarter. The Clinton Administration and private analysts cheered the news because it portrayed an economy no longer running faster than its presumed speed limit, above which inflation would revive. 
 "It's about as good as it can get for a fully employed economy," said Robert G. Dederick, economic consultant to Chicago's Northern Trust Company. "I'm running out of adjectives to describe how well it's doing."
The related Commerce Department price index covering everything Americans buy posted its slimmest quarterly increase since 1961, benefiting from a hefty decline in the price of oil. This inflation gauge rose at a modest 1.9 percent pace in the first quarter even though energy prices advanced.
At the White House, Janet L. Yellen, the President's chief economic adviser, said at a briefing: "Today's G.D.P. numbers suggest that the economy continues to hum. Growth is robust, unemployment remains low at 5 percent, inflation is in check, household wealth is rising and consumer confidence surveys register record optimism."
She added that as one of Mr. Clinton's "paid worriers" she was finding it hard to identify things that could jeopardize the good times.
The report also heartened bond investors, who extended a rally in Treasury securities. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond -- a benchmark for consumer and corporate interest rates -- fell to 6.29 percent today, its lowest level in nearly a year and a half. Bond prices and their yields move in opposite directions.
The 2.2 percent annual growth rate this spring in gross domestic product -- the value of all goods and services produced within the nation's boundaries -- is what most analysts regard as the economy's limit before setting off an upswing in inflation based on how fast the labor force is growing and the amount by which these workers and their machines become more efficient.
The G.D.P. growth rate decelerated from the first quarter, when the growth pace was 4.9 percent, a figure that the department today revised downward from 5.9 percent. Although spring growth matched the consensus expectation, some economists had worried that the pace of expansion would be 3 percent or higher and rekindle speculation that the Federal Reserve could be driven by subsequent evidence of strong momentum to raise interest rates in coming months.
On Friday, the Labor Department is to report on the July job market, which shows few signs of easing.
The Commerce Department also issued today its annual revision of previous G.D.P. numbers. The revision slightly increased the average annual economic growth for the four years from the fourth quarter of 1992 through this year's first quarter. Instead of 2.7 percent a year, the revision put the growth at 2.8 percent.
For the quarter that just ended, Commerce reported that Americans sharply scaled back their spending for motor vehicles and other long-lived and consumable products while cutting back only slightly on services, today's report disclosed.
Personal consumption outlays rose just eight-tenths of 1 percent at an annual rate after surging 5.3 percent during the winter. Durable goods fell at a 5.7 percent pace following a 14.1 percent leap while spending on nondurables fell 2.1 percent after rising 4.7 percent. Services grew at a 3.7 percent clip, nearly matching the January-March gain of 3.9 percent.
The nation's businesses, meanwhile, added to inventories at a very rapid rate for the second consecutive quarter but this accounted for only two-tenths of a point to G.D.P. because there was very little acceleration. By contrast, inventories swelled first-quarter G.D.P. by 1.8 points, or more than one-third of the total increase.
Goods are counted in G.D.P. whether they reach consumers or wind up on store shelves or in warehouses. They are important indicators of future production but hard to analyze because it is never clear what proportion of a buildup results from a consumer pullback and what represents the orders of supremely confident merchants.
But Lee Price, Acting Under Secretary of Commerce for Economic Affairs, pointed today to inventory-to-sales ratios near historic lows, "suggesting little, if any, accumulation of unwanted" stocks.
Real final sales of domestic product rose at a 1.9 percent pace in the second quarter compared with 3 percent in the first quarter, today's report also showed.
Reflecting more cautious consumer spending, the savings rate, as a percentage of disposable personal income, climbed to 4.2 percent in the latest quarter from 3.7 percent for the January-March period.
In current dollars, G.D.P. rose at a 3.6 percent rate in the spring compared with a 7.4 percent pace last winter.
The downward revision in first-quarter G.D.P., to a 4.9 percent pace from 5.9, involved nearly all major sectors, with less fixed investment by business most pronounced.
In a footnote to history, the department wiped away by revision the only quarter of economic contraction, albeit slight, during an expansion that is now in its seventh year. The first quarter of 1993, which had shown a one-tenth of 1 percent rate of decline, is now positive by that amount.
Data included in the gross domestic product for the second quarter of 1997 follow, with all dollar amounts in billions at seasonally adjusted annual rates. Percentage changes are from the previous quarter at seasonally adjusted annual rates.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Best Month For Treasuries Since May '95

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The prices of Treasury securities rose yesterday, rounding out their best month since May 1995, after the Government reported that economic growth slowed in the second quarter while inflation remained subdued.
"It's more of the same story -- growth is fine and inflation is excellent," said Barry Evans, who manages about $2 billion of bonds at John Hancock Funds in Boston. Mr. Evans added that he did not expect today's report on employment for July to disrupt the rally, which drove yields on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond yesterday to the lowest level in almost a year and a half. 
 The 30-year bond's price rose 12/32 , to 104 13/32 , pushing its yield down three-hundredths of a percentage point, to 6.29 percent, the lowest since February 1996. Traders bought bonds after the Government said the economy grew at a 2.2 percent annual pace in the April-June period, compared with 4.9 percent -- which was revised downward from 5.9 percent -- in the first quarter. The price deflator, a measure of inflation, rose at just a 1.4 percent annual rate, the smallest increase since 1964.
Treasuries were also helped when a Colorado highway authority sold municipal bonds and bought more than $700 million of Treasury securities with the proceeds.
Government securities got an additional lift as investors in mortgage bonds switched some of their holdings into Treasuries, amid concern that falling yields might spur a wave of homeowner refinancing, which could hurt returns on mortgage bonds.
Yields on 10-year Treasury notes -- the benchmark for setting most mortgage loans -- dropped to 6 percent, which "will spur a lot of activity in the mortgage market," said Mark Mahoney, chief government bond strategist at UBS Securities.
While investors were cheered by the report on gross domestic product, bonds briefly retreated after the Chicago Purchasing Management Association's index of manufacturing for July fell less than expected, and its index of prices paid rose.
A separate report, showing a bigger-than-expected drop in initial claims for unemployment benefits last week, also kept alive concern that a strong labor market might increase wages and inflation.
Now traders are turning to today's report on July employment. The monthly jobs report is seen as one of the best measures of the economy's strength and prospects for inflation, and can cause large swings in bond prices.
Separately, the Treasury sold $18.1 billion in 48-day cash-management bills yesterday, at an average discount rate of 5.35 percent. The following are the results of yesterday's auction:

When a Casino Loses Its Lifeline to Customers

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK 

DATELINE: LULA, Miss., July 29

 BODY:
The few blackjack dealers still employed at the Lady Luck Casino stand grimly behind their empty tables, nervously tapping the felt with stacks of $5 chips. The one-armed bandits are resting, their slumber broken only occasionally by the whir and clang of a distant machine. The roulette wheel is spinning, but there are no bettors, not for red or black, even or odd, or anything.
"It's going around and around," said Robert Lawrence, the roulette dealer, "but nobody's playing." 
 Nobody has played much of anything at the Lady Luck since July 15, when a barge crippled the U.S. 49 bridge spanning the Mississippi River between Helena, Ark., and Lula, Miss., the most heavily traveled route to the casino.
Luck was not a lady that night. A tall crane being ferried north on a barge scraped the bottom of the 105-foot-high bridge, twisting several steel beams and forcing highway officials to close the span for repairs. It is scheduled to reopen on Monday.
Since the closing, the number of customers to the Lady Luck has dropped 80 percent, said Neal Miller, the casino's general manager. Mr. Miller has spared no expense in trying to keep his regular customers from straying to competing casinos, even offering free helicopter rides from a weedy airstrip in West Helena to the Lady Luck's parking lot. But with the helicopter carrying only three gamblers each trip, it can help only so much.
"It's all been pretty devastating," Mr. Miller said.
The Lady Luck, whose facade features giant guitars soaring from the roof, opened at the foot of the bridge in 1994, four years after casino gambling was legalized in Mississippi. The sole rationale for placing a casino in Lula, a Mississippi Delta hamlet with a population of 225, was to lure gamblers across the bridge from Arkansas, Oklahoma and other states where casinos are banned. The nearest river crossings are in Memphis, 90 miles to the north, and near Greenville, Miss., 90 miles to the south.
The bridge closing has only reinforced the isolation of this desolate, impoverished corner of the South, where the casinos have become islands of population and prosperity in a sea of cotton fields.
Mr. Miller said he could not discuss the financial impact of the bridge closing on the casino, which had a revenue of $88.9 million in 1996. Last year, the casino produced 55 percent of the revenue generated by the Lady Luck Gaming Corporation of Las Vegas, Nev., which owns all or part of six casinos.
Clearly, the Lady Luck is taking a beating. At 11 A.M. on Tuesday, 165 visitors were on the casino floor, compared with the 1,300 that Mr. Miller said would normally be there at that time.
The casino, the largest employer in the area, has had to lay off almost half of its 1,000-person staff, many of them Arkansans. Two of its four restaurants are closed, and a third is open only on the weekends.
In the highly competitive world of Mississippi Delta gambling, rival casinos have tried to take advantage of the Lady Luck's misfortune. Two casinos in Greenville, the Las Vegas Casino and Bayou Caddy's Jubilee Casino, have teamed up with their local convention and visitors bureau to increase their advertising, directing their campaign at the Lady Luck's geographic market.
Officials with the Greenville casinos said they had attracted some new customers but were disappointed that the bridge repairs had gone faster than planned.
"Unfortunately, the downside of all this is the bridge is going to be open sooner," said Mike Howard, general manager of the Jubilee.
To fend off his competitors, both in Greenville and in Tunica to the north, Mr. Miller has offered free meals and discounted hotel rooms to regulars and provided hot-air balloon rides from the casino parking lot. When the bridge reopens, he plans to lure customers back with a fireworks display and a contest to give away four Chevrolet Blazers.
The company may also briefly continue the helicopter rides, which have been popular. About 175 people took the seven-minute trip in the four-seat Bell Jet Ranger 206 on Friday, and 200 did so on Saturday.
As a community service, and to cultivate good will, Mr. Miller also has made the helicopter available to Helena residents who need to cross the river for reasons more compelling even than the compulsion to throw dice. So far, it has transported a cancer patient who received chemotherapy in Mississippi and a physical therapist who treated patients there. It is on call for a pregnant woman who is near delivery.
But primarily, the helicopter is for gamblers. Early on Tuesday afternoon, 20 people were waiting in stifling heat at the West Helena airstrip, which is home to little more than a fleet of lemon-yellow crop dusters. Some of the people had waited more than two hours, but seemed willing to wait longer.
"I'm retired, don't have nothing to do," said James A. Moody, 63, who had driven nearly two hours from his home in Benton, Ark. "It just passes the day."
Mr. Moody said that gambling provided him with "the pleasure of a satisfied mind, just like fishing."
Seated in the cab of his maroon Ford pickup, Cheslie H. Powell, 57, was waiting to take his fourth helicopter trip in the last five days. One day after the bridge was closed, he drove 96 miles from his home in Brinkley, Ark., up through Memphis, and back down to one of the casinos in Tunica, north of Lula. But familiarity quickly brought him back to the Lady Luck, even if it meant a long wait.
"I like the Lady Luck," Mr. Powell said, adding that he knew most of the casino's dealers and managers. "I just feel at home there."

HEADLINE: Reuters Steps Up Its Talks On Times Square Building

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
Reuters, the British media and information giant, is stepping up its negotiations with Prudential Insurance and New York City to build an 800,000-square-foot office tower in Times Square.
The talks, which began in the spring, have reached a decisive stage, according to city officials and Prudential executives. If a deal is struck, Reuters will consolidate operations and build a North American headquarters in a 38-story tower at the northwest corner of Seventh Avenue and 42d Street, one of four sites designated for office buildings under the redevelopment plans for the area, according to executives and officials familiar with the talks. The existing buildings on the block would be demolished. 
 Reuters, which now has about 1,800 employees in 13 buildings in Manhattan, is also considering other locations in the metropolitan area, but city officials and some Prudential executives are optimistic that an agreement can be reached on the Times Square site. Reuters is expected to make a decision on the move within a week.
Reuters, which is known for the rapid transmission of data, photographs and text to financial capitals of the world, would sit across the street from Disney's recently renovated New Amsterdam Theater and blocks away from other, glitzier media companies: Bertelsmann, Viacom and, sometime next year, the Conde Nast publication company.
The potential deal between Reuters and Prudential, which controls the site, could still founder over financial details, design issues or the company's demand for additional tax breaks if it agrees to build a new tower in Times Square. Some Reuters executives are reportedly still debating the wisdom of the move, but the company's demand for extra multimillion-dollar tax subsidies could prove to be a volatile political issue for the Giuliani administration.
Under the Times Square redevelopment plan, the site is already laced with an unprecedented level of tax incentives for midtown Manhattan, and in the last year Times Square has become one of the most desirable business locations in the city.
Brendan Sexton, president of the Municipal Art Society, an influential civic group that has closely followed redevelopment plans in Times Square, said the Society would oppose a double helping of tax breaks for the proposed tower.
"It makes no sense for taxpayers to pay more money in the form of tax breaks to get rid of prime property in Manhattan right now," Mr. Sexton, a former real estate executive, said. "As a business deal for the public, it stinks."
Glen Elliott, vice president for real estate services at Reuters America, declined to comment on any potential sites for a North American headquarters. "We're looking at alternatives throughout the tristate area," he said. "We're not at the decision stage."
The city's Economic Development Corporation customarily declines to comment on whether it is negotiating with any corporation. But Charles Millard, president of the Economic Development Corporation, did say: "Of course, we would want Reuters to stay in, and expand in, the City of New York."
City officials have been meeting with Michael Bailkin, a lawyer hired by Reuters to negotiate with the city over the additional tax incentives, said three people involved in the talks. Mr. Bailkin, who declined to comment because of confidentiality agreements, has developed a reputation in corporate circles for extracting lucrative subsidies for companies that threaten to leave the city. A year ago, Mr. Bailkin helped Conde Nast obtain $10.75 million in tax incentives from the city for a move to a 1.6 million-square-foot tower now under construction on another former Prudential site in Times Square.
That deal provoked criticism from liberal and conservative politicians as well as civic leaders, who described the subsidies as "corporate welfare" and ridiculed any suggestion that Conde Nast would make good on its threat to leave New York.
Reuters is not the only company that has shown interest in the 42d Street site. Douglas Durst, a developer who is building the office tower across Seventh Avenue that will house Conde Nast, had tried unsuccessfully to buy control of the property, for a possible deal with Reuters. And earlier this year, Marriott International talked to Prudential about building a hotel on the corner. Over the last year, Reuters has looked at various locations where it could bring its operations under one roof, including Rockefeller Center.
But Mr. Durst has not given up on the site, either. "Our primary concern, as it has been from the inception of this project, is that the rejuvenation of Times Square occur as quickly as possible," he said. "To that end, we are continuing to expend time and money developing plans for what we believe should be built in Times Square in the belief that we will be the eventual developer of those sites."
Reuters now has an informal agreement with Prudential for exclusive rights to negotiate for the corner of 42d Street and Seventh Avenue, according to executives on both sides of the talks.
More recently, Prudential executives showed state officials some preliminary ideas for a Reuters tower that sparked a fiercely negative reaction. Prudential seemed to have revived six-year-old plans for a tall glass tower designed by the architect Philip Johnson that provided little ground-floor retail space or the kind of vibrant neon signs that have come to characterize Times Square. The plans did include a "news museum" inside the building and a green Reuters logo and video screen outside.
"We were very disappointed," said one person who had seen the plans. "There's no street level excitement."
One Prudential executive suggested that state officials had "overreacted" to what were merely some "preliminary marketing materials."

HEADLINE: Illness Is Turning Into Financial Catastrophe for More of the Uninsured

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: SHERWOOD, Ark.

 BODY:
As her three boys were returning from school one Friday in March, Charlene Prowse, who works nights at a convenience store here, awakened from her day's sleep. Mrs. Prowse, 31 and robust despite a battle six years ago with ovarian cancer, stepped into the hallway of the family's home in this working-class suburb of Little Rock. Then she collapsed.
"Mom was on the floor," said Cory, her 8-year-old son, who rushed in from the porch with his brother Steven, 7. Her husband, Randal Sr., 40, said: "She was shaking, staring into space. I started giving her C.P.R." 
 Charlene Prowse eventually recovered. But the family had no health insurance, and the thousands of dollars worth of medical bills brought on by her illness swept them over the edge, putting them in a red file folder in the fast-expanding bankruptcy stacks at the Federal courthouse in Little Rock.
Their petition, filed in early July, listed nearly $8,000 in medical bills, half of which came from four days that Mrs. Prowse spent at a Little Rock hospital recovering from what doctors said was a seizure.
With the number of uninsured working poor having increased over the last 10 years, the Prowse case is not unusual. Even as managed care and the growth of private hospitals is upending the world of health care and as Washington is putting the finishing touches on a budget bill that provides health insurance for more children, the number of uninsured Americans remains at its highest point in years.
In 1987, according to the Census Bureau, the number of uninsured working people living below the Federal poverty line -- $7,890 a year for individuals and $16,029 for a family of four -- was 8.1 million, which was 45 percent of the working poor. By 1992, when President Clinton was elected and began pressing for an overhaul of the health care system to make sure all workers are covered, the numbers had grown to 9.6 million and 48 percent.
And through 1995, the latest year for which the bureau has data, little had changed. In spite of a growing economy and declining poverty, 9.4 million working poor, still 48 percent of the working poor, did not have health insurance.
Though Congress and state legislatures have been wrestling for months with the problems of the country's 10 million uninsured children, the population of 23 million uninsured working adults, 17 million of whom work full time, has been largely ignored in the debate. The working poor in this group, typically earning $6 or $7 an hour, make too little to afford health insurance but too much to qualify for Medicaid, the state and Federal insurance program for the poor.
So when medical misfortune strikes, they can only plead for the forbearance of doctors, compete for the increasingly scarce resources of charities or file for bankruptcy.
"At least 40 percent of my clients have medical problems that have caused them to file," said Danyelle J. Walker, one of Little Rock's busier bankruptcy lawyers.
The economy, perversely, bears some of the blame. Though it has lifted millions off the welfare rolls and pushed unemployment down to 30-year lows, it has created mostly low-wage service and retail jobs like Mrs. Prowse's, which are much less likely to provide insurance. And once off Government aid, most former welfare recipients cannot rely on Medicaid.
In Arkansas and many other states, the uninsured working poor outnumber the uninsured unemployed poor. In fact, the rise in the uninsured working poor accounts for most of the growth of the nation's uninsured, to more than 40 million today from 31 million a decade ago.
Many are parents weaned from the welfare rolls who keep their Medicaid until a year or two after their wages lift them above the poverty line, under provisions of the law to encourage the poor to get jobs. Most are either blue-collar self-employed workers or wage earners whose employers either do not provide insurance, are terminating it or are raising the share of the cost workers must pay to levels they cannot afford.
"They just do without," said Ray Hanley, medical services director for the Arkansas Department of Human Services. "They have to choose between buying enough medicine and buying enough food."
Dr. Karmen Hopkins, a family practitioner at the St. Vincent Health Clinic East in Little Rock, said, "You present them with a prescription for medication," and when they realize what it will cost, "they look at you like you're crazy."
"They ask you," Dr. Hopkins said, " 'What do you want me not to pay -- the rent or the utilities?' "
From 1994 through April 1997, the economy had generated just 19,000 jobs in well-paid fields like manufacturing, which tend to provide health insurance, while it created 428,000 retail store jobs like Mrs. Prowse's.
"We've had a 5 percent decrease in employer-based coverage because of the shift to the service-based economy," Mr. Hanley said.
Nationwide, the Employee Benefit Research Institute in Washington says, employers providing subsidized insurance dropped to 64 percent last year, from 69 percent a decade ago.
Here, in the President's home state, 17 percent of the population is uninsured, more than in at least 40 other states. Household incomes are just 79 percent of the national average. So in Arkansas, as in much of the South, the squeeze on the working poor is especially pronounced.
And those who study the state say it has become the nation's unhealthiest.
"For the last few years, Arkansas has been at the bottom of the pile" on health issues, said Kathleen Morgan, co-editor of Morgan Quitno Press, a Kansas reference-book publisher that studies state economies and living conditions. The company's most recent study, Ms. Morgan said, shows that people in Arkansas who get sick, stay sick longer than those in any other state.
The Prowses, with an income of $20,000 a year when both parents are fully employed, cannot begin to afford the $450 to $600 a month that Ronald Sheffield, the deputy insurance commissioner of Arkansas, estimates they would have pay on their own for family coverage. Their insurance would cost more than their monthly rent, $400.
The Prowses said that even when Mr. Prowse had a regular job a year ago, maintaining an apartment building, their share of his employer-subsidized insurance -- $241 a month -- cost too much. Like many other small businesses, Mrs. Prowse's employer, Shipley's, does not offer her insurance or most other benefits, like sick pay and vacation pay.
Employers say there is little they can do because of the costs. Foster Higgins, a national employee benefits consulting concern, says that employers who provided health insurance for their employees last year paid an average of $3,915 per worker. That amounts to 38 percent of a full-time worker's earnings at the minimum wage of $5.15 an hour, and many employers say they cannot stay in business if they pay it.
Small employers often must pay even more because they lack big employers' negotiating clout with insurance companies.
And so for the uninsured poor, bankruptcy becomes a solution to a medical crisis. The American Bankruptcy Institute says a record 1,125,006 consumers filed for bankruptcy last year, an increase of 29 percent from the year before and a 150 percent increase since 1986, when 450,000 petitions were filed.
Credit card debt is the biggest culprit, said Samuel J. Gerdano, the bankruptcy institute's executive director. No one, Mr. Gerdano said, breaks down with any precision the other causes, like medical bills, divorce, losing a job or gambling.
But judges and debtors' lawyers say medical bills seem to be surpassing the others. That is the perception in Arkansas.After three years of slight declines, bankruptcy filings in the state, nearly all by consumers, jumped 37 percent in 1995 and 41 percent last year, to 13,189.
An informal review of the latest 200 petitions in Federal court in Little Rock shows a medical bill on 1 in 2 cases. In about 1 out of 4, medical debts exceed the petitioners' other unsecured debts, which are those that have nothing material behind them, like homes and automobiles.
Credit card debt, moreover, may camouflage medical debt. With the proliferation of credit cards, James G. Mixon, one of the state's three Federal bankruptcy judges, said, "Most every doctor or hospital will take a credit card."
"For anybody who's uninsured, that's a way to deal with the problem," Judge Mixon said.
Still, bankruptcy is often a mixed blessing. Many who file, like the Prowses, choose to try to pay off a part of their debts, while others apply to have all their debts wiped out. Under the plan the Prowses worked out, Mrs. Prowse is keeping just $66 of her weekly pay of $211 while the rest goes to pay off debts, including medical bills.
Mr. Prowse, now unemployed, typically earns twice the pay that his wife does when he works. But when the couple filed for bankruptcy, the bank repossessed the 1992 Chevrolet Blazer he used to search for jobs and to get to them. They have a 15-year-old Chevy Silverado, but the transmission needs to be replaced before Mr. Prowse can use it.
Doctors are still unsure what caused Mrs. Prowse's seizure, and now a new problem threatens her health.
"The doctor found a new knot on my ovary," Mrs. Prowse said. "He told me to get over there, that he'd work with me, let me pay $10 a month."
"But I'll have to stay off work for six weeks," she said, explaining that she cannot afford to do so until the fall, when her husband expects to find work and the children are back in school.
"I won't have to pay a baby sitter then," Mrs. Prowse said.

HEADLINE: Sun Microsystems to Buy Diba, a Start-Up

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, July 31

 BODY:
Seeking to broaden its reach in the consumer market, Sun Microsystems Inc. said today that it would acquire Diba Inc., a start-up company that is developing technology for small communications and computing devices called information appliances.
Terms of the deal were not disclosed. 
 The acquisition by Sun follows close on the heels of the Microsoft Corporation's acquisition of Web TV and the Oracle Corporation's acquisition of Navio Inc. for its Network Computer Inc. subsidiary. All three acquisitions illustrate the importance the major computer companies are placing on the convergence of the Internet and television. With Diba, which was founded to create technology for simple devices that could surf the World Wide Web or send electronic mail, Sun is staking its claim on this emerging market.
"There is going to be a realigning of the television world in the next five years," said William Bluestein, an analyst with Forrester Research. "Whether it's Web TV, HDTV or our old friend 500 channels, you're going to see a whole new assault on the television as a platform, so you see all the computer guys circling around. This is essentially a move made by Sun to give it an entree in that world."
Diba will become a new Sun business unit, the Consumer Technologies Group, within the company's microelectronics division. This group will work with major consumer electronics companies, so-called O.E.M.'s, to provide technologies for building consumer products such as Internet-enabled TV's, set top and satellite boxes, and smart phones, said Sun, which is based in Mountain View, Calif. Diba employs 79 people and is based in Menlo Park, Calif.
"Information appliances represent an enormous opportunity for manufacturers who can deliver the right products at the right time," Scott McNealy, Sun's chairman, president and chief executive, said in a statement. "By leveraging the Java software platform and Java-enabled microprocessors with Diba's experience in assembling technology components into complete solutions, Sun hopes to enable O.E.M.'s to take advantage of the market's vast potential sooner rather than later."
Whether the Diba brand name will continue after the acquisition has not been determined.
"We're figuring it out right now in real time as we speak," Farzad Dibachi, Diba's president and chief executive, said in a telephone interview. Mr. Dibachi, a former Oracle executive, and his brother Farid, Diba's chairman and co-founder, will join Sun, reporting to Chet Silvestri, president of Sun Microelectronics, he said.
Part of the appeal of the television market is that Microsoft and its Windows operating system software is not yet entrenched there, Mr. Bluestein said. "The standard is literally up for grabs," he said. "There is compelling reason for it to be based on Windows software.
"One thing to watch will be Sun and Diba versus Oracle and Navio, and whether they agree on a common standard against Microsoft."

HEADLINE: Holders Oust Management Of Sallie Mae

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Shareholders of the Student Loan Marketing Association ousted the management yesterday by electing a dissident slate of directors to run the company, ending a protracted, bitter struggle over its strategy.
Jonathan E. Gray, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, called the vote "the stock market equivalent of the Boston Tea Party; it's a revolution." The company's shares surged in response to the vote. 
 Shareholders also overwhelmingly approved a plan to turn Sallie Mae, as the company is known, into a fully private, state-chartered corporation. Since its creation in 1973, Sallie Mae has been a Government-sponsored enterprise, though it has been partly privatized since then.
While both sides favored full privatization, yesterday's votes culminated a two-year battle over how the company, which buys and services student loans, should conduct its business. On the one side was Sallie Mae's management, and on the other, a group of directors who have called themselves the Committee to Restore Value.
Currently, the company benefits from its quasi-public status by borrowing at below-market interest rates with Government guarantees to buy repackaged loans from banks, though it does not directly issue loans. Under the dissidents' plan, Sallie Mae will now compete with banks by making loans directly to students and schools.
The current management wanted to maintain the lending approach but also wanted to enter other businesses, such as servicing consumer loans, providing back-office processing and computer software services.
"Sallie Mae shareholders have made their choice regarding the future leadership and direction of Sallie Mae," said William Arceneaux, the current chairman of Sallie Mae, and he pledged to cooperate with the newly elected board to achieve a smooth transition to the new corporate structure.
The dissident group is led by Albert L. Lord, a former chief operating officer and chief executive at Sallie Mae and current board member. Mr. Lord, who left Sallie Mae in 1994, will return as chief executive. Edward A. Fox, who served as president and chief executive of Sallie Mae from 1973 until 1990, will become chairman.
The struggle over Sallie Mae's future began at a time when the company's stock price was languishing in the mid-$30's, roughly half the level it was when Mr. Lord left the company.
Following a bitter proxy fight in 1995, Mr. Lord and eight of his associates were elected to the board. Shortly thereafter, Sallie Mae began carrying out a number of recommendations made by the new board members, changes that included deep cuts in expenses and a stock buyback program.
Helped by those changes, for which both sides take credit, Sallie Mae's stock has quintupled in value since 1995.
"It is unprecendented in corporate America for shareholders to replace a management team whose stock has gone up five times in the last two years," said Steven Eisman, an analyst at Oppenheimer & Company.
Final figures of the vote to oust the management were not available, and the results will need to be certified, a process that could take as long as a week. But according to preliminary results, the dissident group received nearly 58 percent of the 44 million proxies cast.
The outcome was greeted with a hearty endorsement from Wall Street. On the New York Stock Exchange, Sallie Mae's shares rose $4.8125, to $149.9375.
The company's surging stock price was reflective of its solid financial position.
Last month Sallie Mae said that second quarter net income rose 16 percent from levels a year earlier, to $119.2 million, or $2.20 a share. At the end of June, the company's portfolio of student loans stood at $41.5 billion, up 11 percent from the same period a year earlier.
Sallie Mae's current management attempted to take credit for many of the changes of the last two years, but analysts said developments at the company in recent weeks did little to instill confidence among investors that the executives had a clear idea of how to move the company forward.
Indicative of what they characterized as disarray was the announcement on June 11 that Lawrence A. Hough would step down as Sallie Mae's chief executive as soon as a successor could be found.
Although Mr. Hough said the idea to resign was his own and was done to seek an end to the stalemate between the dissidents and management, analysts said a number of large institutional shareholders had insisted that Mr. Hough step aside.
The management shake-up made a deep impression on David Drake, director of the proxy advisory service at Institutional Shareholder Services, the nation's largest proxy advisory firm.
As recently as May, Mr. Drake had issued a report supporting current management.
But last week he changed his mind, and strongly endorsed the dissident slate.
"When I sat down and re-evaluated the situation, I thought the dissident slate already has a lot of experience with this company and that they were already dictating strategy from their minority position," he said.
"When I talked to management, they never denied that. And when Mr. Hough resigned, it eroded management stability, which had been a major reason I had supported them before."
Mr. Eisman at Oppenheimer said the Institutional Shareholder Services recommendation "was a major step, and Hough's resignation was a strategic error."
"This is the culmination of what has been an incredibly long, convoluted and exciting story," he said.

Deal Could Keep the Bills In Buffalo for 15 Years

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: FREDONIA, N.Y., July 31

 BODY:
The Buffalo Bills reached an agreement today with local and state agencies that could keep the team at Rich Stadium for another 15 years.
The deal is contingent upon the Bills' selling 90 percent of 76 new luxury suites and 6,900 club seats, and also contingent on legislative approval. New York agreed to pay $63.2 million in stadium improvements and incentives for the Bills' owner, Ralph Wilson. 
 "This is a special day for the Bills, for Buffalo, for the county and the state of New York," Wilson said during a news conference at Fredonia State College, the site of the team's training camp. "The Bills will be here for a long, long time."
The key to keeping the Bills into the next century is selling the new seating. The suites would replace about 5,000 seats some 40 feet from the field.
If sold by Dec. 1, 1998, they would be in place for the following season, and the Bills would be locked in for six years before having an option to buy out of their lease.
If the luxury seats are not sold, the Bills would have an option to move out of town. The maximum agreement is for 15 years.
The deal, reached with Gov. George E. Pataki and Executive Dennis Gorski of Erie County, ends two years of haggling and, if implemented, would eliminate the possibility that the Bills would move.
 The Bills have been in Buffalo since 1960, when Wilson was one of eight original owners who founded the American Football League. The team has played at Rich Stadium under its current lease since 1973.
Wilson for years has voted against teams' moving to other cities, but he has been concerned with the Buffalo economy and season-ticket sales, which decreased from 57,132 in 1992 to a projected 34,000 this year.
New York will reimburse the Bills for an estimated $12 million the team spent to improve the stadium in 1994. Wilson was also given naming rights to the stadium, which would generate millions of dollars annually.

Israel Is Reported to Take Harsh Stance After Bomb
Israeli radio and television reported that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Government had decreed harsh measures against the Palestinian Authority after suicide bombings killed 13 people in a Jerusalem market, and did not exclude sending commandos into Palestinian areas. A1
 
President Clinton and his aides considered options to salvage the rapidly dissolving peace agenda negotiated in Oslo four years ago. A8 

Six Hanged in Burundi
Six people convicted of having taken part in ethnic massacres in Burundi were hanged in Bujumbura, the capital, officials said. The executions of three Hutu, two Tutsi and a member of the Twa ethnic group were the first since the Tutsi-controlled Government began trials last year of people accused of what it calls war crimes. A3
 
German Tax Cuts Shot Down
Germany's opposition Social Democrats shot down a Government proposal pushed by Chancellor Helmut Kohl as the tax "reform of the century," saying it favored the rich. The plan sought to reduce income taxes considerably, in hopes of encouraging investment that would tackle the country's 11 percent unemployment rate. The Government majority was expected to block the opposition's counter-proposal in the lower house of Parliament, leading to an unwieldy political paralysis. A4
 
Court Ponders Swiss Suit
A United States District Court in Brooklyn began hearings over whether a class action suit brought by 18,000 American Jews against Swiss banks, which they contend kept the assets of Holocaust victims, should proceed. A5
 
New Requirements for Mir
NASA announced that in the future American astronauts staying aboard the aging Russian Mir space station will probably have to be qualified to make space walks. The new policy means that Wendy Lawrence, who is too small to fit in a Russian spacesuit, will not stay on Mir. She will fly up to the station aboard the space shuttle, but her replacement, David Wolf, will stay on Mir. A6
 
Rockets Fired in Afghanistan
The Taliban religious army controlling most of Afghanistan sent helicopter gunships to attack opposition soldiers just nine miles north of Kabul, prompting a blistering rocket attack on the capital. Ahmed Shah Massood, the opposition leader, predicted that the Taliban would lose its grip on Kabul within a week. (AP)
 
Japanese Convicted in Lebanon
A judge in Beirut praised a Japanese man who led an attack on an Israeli airport, calling his actions "heroic," but then convicted him and four other Japanese Red Army members on a separate charge of illegally entering Lebanon and sentenced them to three years in prison. One of them served 12 years in an Israeli jail for the 1972 attack on Tel Aviv's airport that killed 24 people. (AP)

Some 'Limited' Tax Breaks Help A Small Constituency
The tax bill passed by Congress includes many narrowly focused provisions that benefit just a few individuals or businesses. But this year, for the first time, President Clinton can veto them if he wishes. Among the beneficiaries of the "limited" tax breaks are hard-cider producers in upstate New York and Vermont, who would pay lower Federal excise taxes, life insurance companies and securities firms, which would be able to defer taxes on income earned from overseas transactions, and software giants like Microsoft, which would get tax breaks intended to encourage exports. A1

The newly approved tax-cut bill, the largest since 1981, includes a package of legislation that offers a net reduction of $96 billion over the next five years in capital gains and estate taxes. A22

Clinton Prevails on Welfare
President Clinton, who last year promised to correct flaws in the welfare bill, largely got his way in the budget agreement that both chambers of Congress have just approved. He paid a price in acquiescing to tax cuts for wealthier Americans, analysts say, but he won major concessions in blunting some of the welfare law's toughest provisions. A1

Blocked Promotion Explained
The Air Force general in charge of the housing complex in Saudi Arabia, where 19 airmen were killed by a terrorist explosion last year, had sufficient warning of a possible attack but failed to safeguard his troops, Defense Secretary William S. Cohen said in explaining his decision to hold the officer accountable and block his scheduled promotion. A20

Benefit Seen in Baby Talk
Baby talk spoken to infants plays a larger role in the development of speech than previously thought, according to a new study. Mothers who engage in baby talk are producing highly exaggerated speech sounds that provide the basis for all subsequent learning of that language. A21

Diet May Reduce Cancer Risk
An experimental diet that included fish oil capsules caused tissue changes that researchers say may lower the risk of breast cancer. In the study at the Jonsson Cancer Center of the University of California at Los Angeles, 25 American women were put on a diet that mimicked foods eaten by Asian women, who have a much lower rate of breast cancer. A14
 
Loophole Aids Tobacco Makers
In a potential windfall for cigarette producers, new taxes paid by smokers will save the tobacco industry billions of dollars by reducing the amount of money companies would owe if the proposed tobacco settlement plan became law. A13
 
The American Medical Association backed the framework of the tobacco settlement, but called for strict language to guarantee the Food and Drug Administration's right to regulate nicotine as a drug. A12

2 Men Arrested in Brooklyn In Apparent Bombing Plot
Two Middle Eastern men were arrested in a Brooklyn apartment, where police officers found components of one or more pipe bombs -- evidence of what the authorities say was a terrorist plot to detonate bombs in the busy Atlantic Avenue subway station and on a commuter bus. The suspects were shot after a team of New York City police officers, acting on a tip from another man who lived in the apartment, burst into the Park Slope apartment an hour before dawn. Police officials said the men were shot when it appeared that they were trying to set off one of the bombs. A1

Crew Survives Newark Crash
A Federal Express cargo plane crashed upon landing at Newark International Airport, turning into a fireball as it skidded several thousand feet down the runway before ending up on its back 100 yards from a passenger terminal. The five people on board climbed out through a hatch in the cockpit and escaped with minor cuts and bruises, rescue workers said. The airport was closed from the time of the crash, about 1:30 A.M., until 7:30 A.M., forcing airlines to divert, delay or cancel hundreds of flights throughout the day. B1

New Smuggling Charges
Federal authorities charged three men with running an operation based in Southern California through which possibly hundreds of deaf Mexicans were smuggled across the border, kept briefly in a Los Angeles house, then taken to New York City where they were held in virtual slavery and forced to peddle key chains and other trinkets.

The economy slowed during the spring as consumers cut back on their spending, Government figures showed.

HEADLINE: Flake to Leave Congress To Devote Time to Church

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS 

 BODY:
Citing the growing weight of his ministerial duties, Representative Floyd H. Flake said yesterday that he would resign from Congress by the end of this year to devote more time to the church in Queens where he has been pastor for 21 years.
Mr. Flake, a 52-year-old Democrat, indicated a week ago that he was considering leaving Congress at the end of his current term, 17 months from now. But, in an interview last night, he said he would leave before the end of the current session in December, declining to be more specific. He said he would make his formal announcement to his congregation on Sunday, at the Allen African Methodist Episcopal Church. 
 The decision to resign, Mr. Flake said, was based on the fact that Allen A.M.E. had recently opened a $23 million cathedral in Jamaica, Queens, and that overseeing its progress and that of the church's swelling social-service and economic empire would require his full attention.
"I believe this is one of those situations where the congregation needs me," said Mr. Flake, who is serving his sixth term in Congress. "And I want to build the church operation in a way that allows us to have the foundation to make sure our ministry grows."
With his departure, Mr. Flake will become the second member of Congress from New York City to resign this year. Susan Molinari, a Republican from Staten Island, resigned to become an anchorwoman on a CBS television news program. Her resignation becomes effective today, leaving behind a spirited race for her seat in Congress.
Similarly, the departure from Congress of Mr. Flake, which comes far sooner than many in political circles had expected, is certain to set off a torrent of activity among the various politicians in southeastern Queens who hope to succeed him.
The name mentioned most frequently is Gregory W. Meeks, a State Assemblyman, who has a close relationship with Mr. Flake. Mr. Meeks, 43, is also chairman of the state Council of Black Elected Democrats.
Another is State Assemblywoman Barbara M. Clark, 58, who has been in office since 1987 and has already begun discussing fund-raising strategies, several political officials said. State Senator Alton R. Waldon Jr., 60, who briefly held a seat in Congress a decade ago, is also said to be interested. Archie Spigner, 68, a member of the City Council since 1974, is also mentioned as a possible contender.
If Mr. Flake's resignation becomes effective after Oct. 1, Gov. George E. Pataki can call a special election no sooner than 30 days after the seat is vacant and no later than 40 days afterward, under the state's election law. If his resignation becomes effective before Oct. 1, an election for a new representative could be held in November, at the same time the polls will be open for other municipal races.
Mr. Flake said he had not decided whom he would endorse. "At the moment I am trying to inform people of my own decision and work my way through that," he said. "Then, I will deal with other decisions like an endorsement."
Any endorsement by the Congressman, however, would be welcomed by any of the contenders because half of Allen A.M.E.'s 8,600 members live within the congressional district.
Allen A.M.E. is one of the city's largest congregations and its new, 2,500-seat cathedral, which opened a week ago, is the second-largest predominantly black church in New York City, behind the Concord Baptist Church in Brooklyn.
Under Mr. Flake's pastorship, the church's operations have been complex and diverse. Allen A.M.E. has established an elementary school for about 500 students, a 300-unit senior citizens complex, a bus chartering corporation and a community center that operates a health clinic and a Head Start program. The church's development corporation has also purchased commercial storefronts.
Mr. Flake said he felt comfortable about leaving his position now because several of the projects he has worked on in the Jamaica neighborhood -- a Federal Aviation Administration headquarters and a regional office of the Food and Drug Administration -- are nearly complete.
While Mr. Flake has often been mentioned as a possible mayoral candidate in 2001, he said yesterday that he had no political plans. "I have no political program whatsoever," he said. "I would not limit myself by saying that I would not pursue something that might make sense one day. But my only specific plans now are focused on the church."
In addition to his work at the church, Mr. Flake said he intends to lecture and write books on the need for black elected officials to revise their political strategies and to devote more attention to economic development in their areas.
"It is my belief that much of our leadership is still mired in the rhetoric of the 1960's and 1970's," Mr. Flake said. "Serving in a legislative body and doing practical economic development in a community that many had given up on represents what can be done. I expect to have a lot to say about that in the future."

HEADLINE: THE BUDGET DEAL: THE SCORECARD;
In Budget Bill, President Wins Welfare Battle

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 31

 BODY:
When President Clinton signed the welfare bill last year, he said it was "far from perfect," and pledged to "change what is wrong."
Slim as the odds seemed then, Mr. Clinton largely got his way in the budget agreement that both chambers of Congress have just approved. He paid a price in acquiescing to tax cuts for wealthier Americans, analysts on the left and right say, but he won major concessions in blunting some of the welfare law's toughest provisions. 
 The President also lost some battles. For example, he was unable to raise food stamp allotments to families living in high-cost areas like New York City, where the rent can consume more than half their income, and he won only $1.5 billion of the $4.8 billion he sought for all food stamp spending.
Moreover, nothing changes the basic objective of the welfare law that both Mr. Clinton and Congress endorse. It turns over most of the control of the welfare system to the states, ends the old system's womb-to-tomb entitlement to cash assistance, limits welfare payments to families to a maximum of five years and requires that welfare recipients be engaged in work or work-related activity within two years.
Besides the concessions in the budget bill, Mr. Clinton has won important battles over how the regulations implementing the 1996 welfare law are applied. For example, the Labor Department recently ruled that welfare recipients who take state jobs must be paid the $5.15-an-hour minimum wage, a ruling that has Southern states bristling, and that the budget bill lets stand.
Elaine Ryan, director of government affairs for the American Public Welfare Association, said Mr. Clinton "certainly got what he wanted" for the welfare law in the budget deal.
Douglas J. Besharov, resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, said, "The President succeeded in moving the bill much closer to his own priorities."
Wendell E. Primus, who helped write Mr. Clinton's original welfare legislation and resigned in protest over the compromises worked out with Congress, said the economy must weather a recession before the impact of the welfare law can be fairly assessed. "But," Mr. Primus added, "there's no doubt that this budget bill, in terms of what it does for immigrants, welfare-to-work and food stamps, reverses some of the worst aspects of the welfare law."
Under the 1996 welfare law, noncitizens, including many who had worked in the United States and paid taxes for up to 10 years, lost Supplemental Security Income, the welfare program for the aged and disabled poor, and Medicaid, the health insurance program for the poor.
Now, legal immigrants who resided in the United States last Aug. 22, when the President signed the welfare bill into law, remain eligible for the programs, whether they were covered by them then or will need them in the future. Only those arriving in this country after that date remain excluded.
The budget bill gives the President another provision that he stressed in his re-election campaign last fall: a welfare-to-work tax credit.
To encourage more employers to hire and retain welfare recipients, Congress approved paying employers a 35 percent credit on wages up to $10,000, or $3,500, in the first year that those who had been on welfare remain on the job, and even more -- 50 percent on the first $10,000 of their second year's wages. The Department of Health and Human Services said the plan would cost only $600 million over six years.
Congress also approved $3 billion over two years in job-hunting assistance for mostly single, able-bodied adults. Under the welfare law, this group is treated more harshly than most. They are allowed food stamps only for three months every three years unless they are working.
But the budget bill permits states to exempt 15 percent of the adults from this requirement, and it allocates the $3 billion for job-hunting assistance and training, which critics say violates the welfare law's overriding objective of requiring all recipients to go to work.
"The welfare bill had an operating paradigm -- work, not job training," Mr. Besharov said. "This is a $3 billion boondoggle, hush money, for big-city mayors to quiet them down on welfare reform."
Able-bodied adults have also profited from the way the Administration is enforcing the three-month, three-year provision. The law permits states to exempt communities with unemployment above 10 percent or with shortages of jobs.
But the law does not establish criteria for such job-shortage areas, so the Department of Agriculture, which enforces food stamp regulations, has been using a Labor Department criteria to define such areas. So far, said a department spokesman, Phil Shanholtzer, "hundreds and hundreds of communities in at least 41 states" have been exempted.
The Administration's biggest coup may be in the $24 billion that Congress granted over five years to extend Medicaid to half the nation's 10 million children who lack health-care coverage. Part of the cost would be paid with increases in the cigarette tax, from 24 cents a pack now to 34 cents by 2000 and 39 cents by 2002.
That and the restoration of Medicaid for legal immigrants and for some disabled children who lost it under the welfare law mark a big change in the fortunes of the working poor and of indigent families, Administration officials said.
"With Medicaid," said Melissa T. Skolfield, the spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services, "we were able to achieve everything we wanted."
The Children's Defense Fund, one of the 1996 welfare law's harshest critics, remains opposed to the welfare-to-work time limits, but is pleased with the Medicaid changes. "The child health provision is a very big victory," said Deborah Weinstein, director of the fund's family income division.
Across the political spectrum, analysts say Mr. Clinton won much more than he lost. Isabel V. Sawhill, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute and for two years an associate director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, urges a wholly different overhaul of the welfare system, one that focuses much more on school systems and ailing cities.
"But from a political perspective," she added, "you have to call this a real win for the President and a partial win for the poor."
Michael Tanner, director of health and welfare studies at the conservative Cato Institute, was most critical of the Labor Department's requirement that people on workfare receive the minimum wage. "We are rapidly undoing the welfare reform law even before we've seen if it works," he said.
But he agreed with Ms. Sawhill on another point. "The President got everything he wanted," he said, "and then some."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Surges Against Mark On Strong U.S. Economic Data

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar hit an eight-year high against the mark yesterday and surged in most other currency dealings, powered by strong United States economic data that raised the prospect of higher interest rates.
The advances in jobs, incomes, spending and manufacturing suggested inflationary pressures that might persuade Federal Reserve policy makers to nudge up rates at their August meeting. Higher rates tend to strengthen a currency. 
 The dollar also briefly surpassed the 119-yen level for the first time in two months on signs of Japanese economic weakness, but it retreated to end lower on rumors of possible intervention to defend the yen by the Bank of Japan. A drop in the mark's value against the yen also indirectly helped strengthen the Japanese currency versus the dollar.
Traders said the power of the dollar's advance against the mark increased during the day, as those who had sold dollars on a bet the currency would retreat scrambled to buy them back.
"It's really kind of taken off," said Jim Powers, vice president of foreign exchange sales at Westdeutsche Landes Bank in New York. "The numbers that came out today were very strong in the U.S., leading people to think a possible pre-emptive interest-rate tightening is in the cards, and that's dollar bullish."
The dollar hit an intraday high of 1.8675 marks, the strongest since November 1989, before settling in New York at 1.8635 marks, up from 1.8384 marks on Thursday. The advance left the dollar 1.4 percent higher against the mark for the week, 6.7 percent higher for the month of July and 20.8 percent higher for the year.
Against the yen, the dollar reached an intraday high of 119.18, the strongest since May 12, before falling to settle in New York at 118.40, down from 118.59 on Thursday. The pound weakened to $1.6318 from $1.6420.
Traders were also emboldened to buy dollars for marks yesterday because of an increasing belief that Germany's central bank will not take action to arrest the dollar's advance.
There had been speculation since last week that the Bundesbank might nudge up German interest rates as a sign that it was prepared to defend the mark. But Bundesbank officials have been quiet since then in the face of the dollar's gains.

HEADLINE: Golden Years for H.M.O.'s;
Budget Deal May Push More Elderly Into Managed Care

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
Older Americans escaped the costly overhaul of their Medicare benefits that some lawmakers in Congress were seeking in Washington's budget negotiations this week. But like younger people with employer-paid or individual health insurance, the elderly are finding it harder to dodge the pressures to sign up for managed care.
Attracted by coverage for prescription drugs and other expensive features that the Government does not pay for in traditional fee-for-service Medicare, five million elderly and disabled people, almost one in seven, have joined a health maintenance organization, almost all in the last 12 years. 
 Each month, 100,000 more sign up, trading the freedom to choose their doctors and hospitals for the simplicity and lower costs of managed care. And though the proportion of elderly in managed care is far less than the majority of working Americans in such plans, the budget agreement will very likely speed the narrowing of that gap.
It provides for higher payments to H.M.O.'s in rural areas, which will most likely draw more elderly patients into managed health plans, without cutting the generous payments that have allowed urban H.M.O.'s to offer broad coverage.
Patients have the legal right to return to traditional Medicare if they later become unhappy with their health maintenance organizations. But going back is not easy because fee-for-service coverage for the elderly is becoming more costly.
Under the budget agreement, the $43.80 monthly Medicare premium for doctors' care and other nonhospital charges will gradually rise to $105.40 by 2007, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
Meanwhile, after four years of shadowing the general inflation rate, premiums for the so-called Medigap policies that supplement traditional Medicare are rising sharply as well.
No one has analyzed the latest rates set by the hundreds of insurance companies that sell Medigap coverage. But last year, the average cost of a basic Medigap policy rose 31.4 percent in Arizona, 32.4 percent in Ohio and 27.2 percent in Virginia, said Lisa Alecxih, who headed a recent study of Medigap plans conducted by the Lewin Group, a research firm in Alexandria, Va., for the Commonwealth Fund.
Not least of the reasons why Medigap rates are skyrocketing is that it is the healthier elderly who are joining health maintenance organizations, leaving a smaller pool of sicker people in the market for Medigap coverage. Moreover, most private carriers and Blue Cross plans now base their Medigap charges on age, so older people pay higher premiums. And even the American Association of Retired Persons, which does not have age-based premiums, raised its prices by 45 percent in the last two years, opening the floodgates to increases by commercial carriers, health finance experts said.
The bottom line is that out-of-pocket spending on health care by the elderly averages more than $2,600 a year, or 21 percent of their income, according to another Commonwealth Fund study.
So while the Clinton Administration says it favors choice for the 38 million people served by Medicare, remaining in -- or returning to -- traditional Medicare is becoming a luxury beyond the reach of many people of modest means, just as working people are being priced out of traditional fee-for-service health care.
"An H.M.O. is the only way I can afford medical care," said Steven Brown, a taxi driver in Venice, Calif., who recently became eligible for Medicare.
Indeed, about five million elderly people enrolled in traditional Medicare are unable to afford any kind of Medigap plan, said Patricia Newman, director of a project on Medicare policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation. That leaves them without coverage for the first $736 of annual hospital charges, the first $100 each year of doctors' fees and then 20 percent of all remaining medical charges.
About 12 million people pay out of pocket for Medigap coverage; 9.6 million more retirees have employer-financed Medigap benefits, although many employers have been pushing their retirees, like their active employees, into health maintenance organizations.
Elderly H.M.O. members have told researchers that they prefer managed care because of the lower costs and extra benefits, made possible by lavish Government payments to health plans in cities where Medicare payments are already high.
A survey of 11,000 Medicare beneficiaries by the Sachs Group, a health care information firm, found, for example, that H.M.O. enrollees were more likely to be satisfied than those with traditional Medicare. Moreover, fewer than 100,000 each year have returned to traditional Medicare. The budget agreement would make the move back more difficult starting in 2000 by narrowing the time frame in which the switch could be made without the patient being denied coverage for pre-existing medical conditions.
The H.M.O. recruits are attracted by reduced or no monthly premiums, nominal out-of-pocket fees -- typically $5 or $10 for a visit to a doctor -- and free or low-priced extras such as prescription drugs or eyeglasses. Coverage is especially generous in California, Florida and cities like New York, Boston and Philadelphia, where Medicare rates are high, the elderly are numerous and the competition among H.M.O.'s is fierce.
Mimi Schreiber, 67, of Lakewood, Calif., said she had "loved every minute" of her care at Kaiser Permanente, a unit of Kaiser Foundation Health Plan and Hospitals and the biggest health maintenance organization in California. "If I was rich, I could afford a private doctor," she said. "You have to be realistic."
In part, such expressions of satisfaction reflect the ways that health maintenance organizations focus on the elderly population. "The beneficiaries who enroll in H.M.O.'s are systematically younger and healthier than those who don't," said Bruce C. Vladeck, head of the Federal Health Care Financing Administration, which runs Medicare. The American Association of Health Plans, an H.M.O. trade group, argues that this is not true.
Experts note that health maintenance organizations do not advertise to attract the chronically ill, who only add to their costs. "No health plan says, 'We are really good at arthritis,' " said Stan Jones, a health insurance policy analyst at George Washington University.
In fact, H.M.O. members in several surveys have expressed less satisfaction than other elderly patients when asked about delays in getting care and referrals to specialists.
Stories like that of George Thomas, a 72-year-old retired Navy pilot who lived near San Diego until recently moving to a Los Angeles suburb, fuel their fury.
As a member of a Medicare H.M.O., Mr. Thomas said, he was shuttled among hospitals and nursing homes last year and ultimately was sent home when he complained of fainting spells and intense neck pains. His weight dropped 47 pounds to a skeletal 118 in nine months, and he was too weak to walk.
"He was dying," his daughter, Sharon Cain, said. "His doctor in San Diego threw up his hands and said, 'I don't know what else I can do.' "
Luckily, Superman came to Mr. Thomas's rescue. His grandson, Dean Cain, the actor who played the superhero in ABC's "Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman," arranged to have Mr. Thomas transferred to the University of California at Los Angeles Medical Center.
Because FHP International, Mr. Thomas's health plan, refused to approve the move, Mr. Cain said he had to provide a $30,000 cashier's check before U.C.L.A. would admit his grandfather. The Los Angeles doctors diagnosed a dangerous spinal infection that had also damaged Mr. Thomas's heart.
Now, Mr. Thomas is suing FHP, contending that the health plan and its doctors failed "to provide reasonably necessary care" without regard to cost, as required by state and Federal H.M.O. regulations. The suit contends that FHP and the doctors knew that "financial considerations" would "override reasonable patient care needs."
Cheryl Brady, a spokeswoman for Pacificare Health System, which bought FHP in February, said the H.M.O. was "not aware that they had any problems, or an issue over the quality of care or the treatment being provided by the medical group." After the suit was filed, Pacificare recently paid part of the U.C.L.A. hospital bill.
Mr. Thomas, who is back on his feet and feeling stronger, said he would like to return to traditional Medicare. But like many older patients, he said he was unable to find a Medigap insurer that would cover his "existing conditions" -- not to mention the $500 he spends each month for medicine.

HEADLINE: Madeleine Albright Sings Out

 BODY:
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's belting parody of "Don't Cry for Me, Argentina" at this week's meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations drew critical acclaim from her fellow foreign ministers. They were not as happy with her speeches, which some dismissed as patronizing lectures on human rights. Americans, however, would consider her performance a spirited defense of their values, exactly the kind of plain speaking Ms. Albright promised when she took the job, and exactly what Asean needed to hear.
Ms. Albright offended by speaking the truth. After the Foreign Minister of Myanmar, once known as Burma, depicted his country as a human rights paradise, Ms. Albright quickly set the record straight. She also unsuccessfully tried to convince Japan, an Asean observer, to suspend aid to Cambodia. After a coup there earlier this month, Asean uncharacteristically reversed its earlier decision to admit Cambodia. But its members considered Ms. Albright's plea an unwarranted interference in Cambodia's affairs. 
 Leaders in Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore have long argued that Asians do not value or need individual political and civil rights and that governments should not try to force these concepts on others. In Asia, these leaders say, the interests of society trump those of the individual. They also point to the importance of economic rights and their own nations' notable success in reducing poverty. At the Asean meeting, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad of Malaysia even endorsed rewriting the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which he said did not suit developing countries. That document, adopted in 1948, does contain the right to a decent standard of living, but focuses mainly on political and civil rights.
The Asian-values argument is hollow. Numerous studies have shown that whether a country is a democracy or an autocracy has little effect on its economic growth. Asean's members need only look in the mirror. The Philippines, a democracy, grew nearly 7 percent last year. Myanmar, ruled by a repressive military junta, is nearly bankrupt, in part due to swollen military spending.
It would be easier to take these leaders' concerns about Asian values seriously if they were not so self-serving. No one knows if Indonesians want political rights, because they are not allowed to say so. But everyone knows that life would become unpleasant for Indonesia's Government if journalists could expose official corruption or citizens could vote freely. Malaysia's Dr. Mahathir did not enhance his credibility, moreover, when he accused the American financier and philanthropist George Soros of trying to bring down Asian currencies because Asean admitted Myanmar.
Ms. Albright drew criticism not only for what she said, but also because she dared to say it at all. American officials do indeed spend much of their time telling the rest of the world what to do. But Ms. Albright is speaking out for freedom. Asean is a cozy club of mainly authoritarian leaders whose human rights policies benefit themselves at the expense of their people. We hope Ms. Albright will return next year for an encore.

HEADLINE: Economic Analysis;
Measuring Productivity in the 90's: Optimists vs. Skeptics

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
To hear Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, tell it, along with various bulls on Wall Street and assorted chief executives, the United States is entering a period in which the productivity of the American worker is accelerating in ways reminiscent of the best years of the country's economy. And that is why the economy is strong, stock prices are rising and both will continue upward.
The productivity enthusiasts pushing this view argue that the new electronic technologies have finally been harnessed and exploited in the workplace. Starting in 1994 or so, they say, the nation's workers have been producing more for each hour and each day they work. Most important, this improvement will last, they say. 
 Their enthusiasm, however, relies heavily on their own narrow measures of productivity -- measures they consider more accurate -- and on circumstantial evidence. The official broad statistics flatly deny that productivity is rising. Quite the contrary, they show it weaker than ever in the 1990's. Many economists, embracing the official statistics, are skeptical of the bullish view. And even on Wall Street there are those who contend that the productivity optimists, including Mr. Greenspan, are engaging in "creative statistics" to make their case.
"Productivity is a broad national concept that does not lend itself to mining statistical data for favorable results," said Stephen S. Roach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley & Company. "I am really critical of Mr. Greenspan for doing that."
The stakes in this debate are enormous. The performance of the stock market and the future financing of Social Security and Medicare are increasingly tied to the outcome.
Corporate profits, for example, have been growing lately at more than double the rate of growth of the economy itself. In the absence of rising prices, that can only be happening, the productivity optimists say, if workers are producing more for a given day's work, and the added revenue from their production is going into profits. The rising profits, in turn, have justified rising stock prices. And the expectation that profits will continue to rise, thanks to the growing productivity, keeps the Dow Jones average climbing.
"Improved productivity has played a key role in profit margins, profit growth and the resulting rise in stock prices," said Abby Joseph Cohen, chief equity strategist for Goldman, Sachs & Company.
Beyond Wall Street, rising productivity and rising profits in the years ahead would mean rising tax revenues, just when the Federal Government needs the money to help pay for Medicare and Social Security as baby boomers retire. That has made the Administration distinctly sympathetic to the rising productivity argument. "It makes Social Security and Medicare much less of a crisis," said Lee Price, the Commerce Department's Acting Under Secretary for Economic Affairs.
Productivity measures a worker's output in a given time period. Take as an example a long-distance telephone operator. Her company has furnished her with an array of new computers and software. As a result, she increases the hourly revenue that she brings the company from toll calls to $1,022 from $1,000 -- money that can go into profits or wages or both. This operator's 2.2 percent productivity improvement was in fact roughly the rate of productivity growth for the nation's entire work force in the postwar decades, until 1973.
The 1990's are a different matter. While many workers are indeed becoming more efficient, the official statistics say that the average rate of productivity improvement for the private sector work force as a whole during the 90's has been only nine-tenths of 1 percent annually.
The skeptics believe that discouraging statistic. They argue that as wages rise, and they are beginning to do so, the higher pay will either cut into profits, hurting the stock market, or force companies to raise prices. With inflation rising, the Federal Reserve will respond by raising interest rates to slow the economy. Mr. Greenspan says that rising productivity may be saving the day, but he makes no bones about what Fed policy will be if he is wrong.
The productivity optimists start with the accurate observation that the nation enjoys today a rare combination of healthy economic growth, rising profits, low inflation and plentiful employment. While others more pessimistically argue that this current, happy moment can be explained as a temporary phenomenon -- a result mainly of shifting corporate income into profits and away from wages -- the optimists insist that rising productivity is the only explanation that solves the puzzle.
They charge that the official productivity measure, showing very weak growth, is inaccurate, a victim of mismeasurement. To make their case, they explore a range of statistics for evidence that their thesis is correct. Or they adopt more positive, narrower measures of productivity, as Mr. Greenspan has done.
One test came this week, when the Commerce Department announced updated estimates of how much the economy, as measured by the gross domestic product, has actually grown since late 1992. The productivity optimists had expected a sharp upward revision. The G.D.P., in effect, adds together all the final sales -- retail sales and telephone tolls, for example -- to gauge the total output of the economy in a given year. The higher the output for the same number of hours worked, the higher the productivity growth rate.
But the G.D.P. revision was minor. The average annual growth from 1992's last quarter through this year's first quarter was revised upward by only one-tenth of 1 percent, to 2.8 percent, not enough to make a difference in productivity.
The revision held another disappointment for the productivity enthusiasts. While the Commerce Department and most economists consider adding together all final sales as the most accurate measure of output, the productivity enthusiasts would prefer to add together "income" -- that is, all the wages, salaries, dividends and profits earned in producing the national output.
Theoretically, the "income" measure of G.D.P. should equal the "product" measure. But in recent years, income has been running well ahead of product, suggesting a higher productivity growth rate than Government statisticians accept as accurate. The productivity enthusiasts had hoped the revision would close that gap by raising the product calculation to the level of income. That did not happen.
Still, Mr. Greenspan embraces the income approach. Basing his decision on research by two Fed economists, he has decided that the more accurate measure of national productivity is really contained in a subset of the overall statistic. The overall statistic covers all three private sectors: financial, corporate and noncorporate.
Mr. Greenspan's new favorite measure covers only the corporate sector, leaving out the two others, which he considers harder to measure. While the overall productivity statistic shows just under 1 percent annual growth in the 1990's, the corporate sector has averaged 1.5 percent, surging to more than 2.5 percent in the last 24 months. While "product" is used to calculate output for overall productivity, the higher "income" calculation determines corporate productivity.
The difference in these two measures, the Fed said in a just-released report signed by Mr. Greenspan, "raises the possibility that overall productivity is stronger than indicated by the official index for nonfarm business."
To which Mr. Roach of Morgan Stanley replies: "What Mr. Greenspan is doing is taking apart the national trend and finding a piece of it that fits his story."

HEADLINE: U.S. LIFTS A BAN ON WEAPON SALES TO LATIN AMERICA

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 1

 BODY:
Reversing a policy enacted two decades ago because of human rights concerns, the Clinton Administration announced today that it would lift the ban on sales of the most advanced weapons, like fighter jets and tanks, to countries in Latin America.
President Carter imposed the ban in 1978, determined to deny advanced weaponry to the military dictatorships that then ruled most of Central and South America. In recent years, though, the Pentagon and the nation's military contractors have pressed the White House to allow some sales, arguing that most of the countries, except Cuba, are now moving toward democracy. 
 The Administration said it would now consider allowing arms sales "case by case," essentially putting Latin American countries through the same approval process as other countries. In announcing the change, the Administration insisted that selling the weapons would help stabilize the region and bolster the transition to democracy.
"It is in America's national security interest to promote stability and security among our neighbors in the hemisphere by engaging with them as equal partners as they modernize and restructure their defense establishments," said a statement released today by the White House spokesman, Michael D. McCurry.
The reversal is a victory for the big military contractors, like the Lockheed Martin Corporation and the McDonnell Douglas Corporation. While the arms market in Latin America is relatively small -- ranging from $500 million to as much as $2 billion a year, most of it for aircraft -- the change could open markets in countries that have in the past bought weapons elsewhere.
"Latin American countries will now be able to consider American products as well as European and other," said Joel L. Johnson, a vice president of the Aerospace Industries Association in Washington, which represents aircraft makers. "We have had for the last two decades a policy of unilateral paternalism, in which we've told them they shouldn't have modern military equipment. And the end result is they bought it elsewhere."
The Administration's decision, which followed an internal review that dragged on for more than a year, drew immediate criticism from lawmakers and arms-control advocates. They say that Latin American democracies remain unstable and that an influx of advanced weapons could set off an arms race in the region and rekindle traditional rivalries like those between Chile and Argentina, or Peru and Ecuador.
Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, denounced the change and said he would redouble efforts to pass legislation restoring the restrictions on sales. Representatvie Nita M. Lowey, a Democrat from New York, has introduced similar legislation in the House.
"I continue to believe that the 20-year policy has worked and is the right policy," Mr. Dodd said. "I find it hard to believe that selling sophisticated aircraft, such as F-16's, helps to maintain regional security and stability."
Perhaps anticipating criticism, the White House made the announcement with little fanfare, issuing a statement today as Congress broke for its August recess.
The previous policy was not a blanket ban on sales of weapons including jets, helicopters, tanks and radar systems. Instead it was "a policy of restraint with the presumption of denial." In practice, though, only once did the United States allow an exemption for a major sale, permitting Venezuela to buy 24 F-16 fighter jets in 1981 because of its fears about Soviet troops stationed in Cuba.
The Pentagon, under Secretary of Defense William J. Perry, asked President Clinton to review the policy two years ago. Chile, which made its transition to democracy from military rule in 1990, also promoted the reconsideration, expressing an interest in buying 18 to 24 F-16's.
The review led to an internal debate. Warren Christopher, Secretary of State at the time, told the Senate's Committee on Foreign Relations, "I think we should show great restraint in introducing new or high levels of weapons into areas where they do not presently have them."
In January, however, Mr. Christopher joined Mr. Perry in recommending the review before both stepped down. Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright also supported the change, State Department officials said, but Mr. Clinton held off on a decision until now as opponents in the Administration continued to argue against it.
Administration officials said today that even now the United States scrutinize each request closely, granting sales only to those countries with solidifying democracies and firm civilian control over the military. Also, officials said the United States would not approve sales to countries with unresolved conflicts, like Peru and Ecuador, which battled along their border just last year.
"It's a lifting of the ban, not an invitation to an arms race," Thomas F. McLarty 3d, the President's special coordinator for Latin American policy, said.
The likelihood of military conflict in Latin America has certainly declined in recent years as countries moved toward civilian governments and increasingly integrated their economies.
Thomas E. McNamara, the Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs, said the United States had to allow countries in Latin America to modernize their militaries, as any modern democracy would. Jeffrey S. Davidow, the Assistant Secretary for Inter-American Affairs, said the change was "a sensitive decision" but was the next step in relations with the region.
"If we're going to deal with these countries as democracies," he said, "I think we have to have a little faith and confidence in them."

HEADLINE: Strong Economic Data Send Bonds Sharply Lower, Stocks Less So

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
For weeks, investors have been pushing interest rates lower and stock prices higher on the belief that the economic outlook was a combination of moderate growth and low inflation.
But with the July employment data and purchasing managers report issued yesterday, they got a hint that growth is not moderating as much as they had thought. This made them think of inflation and wonder how much longer the Federal Reserve could hold off raising interest rates. And they ran for the hills. 
 In the sharpest selloff in the bond market in more than a year, the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond jumped to 6.45 percent, from 6.29 percent on Thursday. And in stocks, the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks initially tumbled more than 1 percent.
But while bonds kept falling, the stock market rebounded, with the Dow -- which had been down 118 points, finishing off 28.57, at 8,194.04, and the Nasdaq composite up 0.52 point, at 1,594.33. Still, declining stocks led advancers by a nearly 2-to-1 margin.
The rebound in stocks late in the afternoon may be a signal that the new economic data, while surprising, do not change the optimistic outlook significantly. Or it may be a tribute to the incredible resilience of a market that has the backing of millions of investors who are pouring their money into equity mutual funds.
While analysts were cautious about interpretations of the new data, there was no rush to revise forecasts or change predictions about when the Federal Reserve might see enough signs of rising inflation to increase interest rates. They are now 5.5 percent, and the central bank is still expected to remain on hold for some time.
"You can say that things are not in the nirvana state that we have believed in," said Cheryl R. Katz, senior economist at Merrill Lynch. "Or you can look at the data and say 'hey, wait,' they are not really consistent with other economic numbers." She took the latter approach, sticking with a forecast of moderate growth, low inflation, a steady Federal Reserve and, therefore, a positive outlook for bonds and stocks.
The July jobs report showed that the unemployment rate had dropped to 4.8 percent and that 316,000 new nonfarm jobs had been created. The 316,000 was higher than the 200,000 expected and signaled that labor pressure -- which could lead to higher wages -- had not eased.
But the data that generated more selling in both the bond and stock markets were in the report of the National Association of Purchasing Management. Its factory index rose to 58.6 in July from 55.7 in June. At the same time, the closely watched index of prices paid jumped to 53.6, from 48.1 in June.
Both the jobs and purchasing managers reports indicated that the economy was going to be growing faster in the third quarter than in the second, said Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management. But, he added, it is still unclear how much faster. He is forecasting growth of 2.5 percent to 3 percent, compared with the 2.2 percent annual pace in the second quarter and the 4.9 percent rate in the first quarter.
The longer-term issue, he said, "is whether this stronger growth translates into inflationary pressure."
"Until you see signs of inflationary pressures, it's hard to be bearish, he added. "The question is how bullish are you going to be."
And he noted that while the headline numbers in the jobs report were higher than expected, other data, including average weekly hours, manufacturing overtime and the manufacturing workweek all declined last month.
Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at the First Albany Corporation, saw a little more to worry about than some others in yesterday's data. He cited three warnings of rising inflation: the rise in the prices-paid index and a slowdown in supplier deliveries, both in the purchasing managers report, and an increase in the ratio of those employed to the number of people able to work.
"It's not alarming, but it's a cause for concern," he said, adding that he no longer considered it a "sure bet" that the Fed would not raise interest rates when its policy-making committee meets in August and September.
Mickey D. Levy, chief economist at Nationsbank, is still positive about the outlook for stocks and bonds, although he thinks that rates could rise in the near term as the economy picks up some. "The market was good news-vulnerable," he said, referring to its recent gains. "Now, with these types of numbers, the market is going to be wary of the pickup of growth and could be bad news-vulnerable."
In the bond market, the selloff was aggravated, said William Dudley, chief United States economist at Goldman, Sachs, by the prospect of the Treasury's quarterly auction of notes and bonds next week, an event that can add uncertainty.
In the stock market, the Standard and Poor's index did not rebound as well as the Dow, finishing down 7.15 points at 947.14.
J. P. Morgan, which fell 1 3/8, to 114 1/2, led the Dow lower. But it also contributed to the Dow's rebound as it came back from a low of 112 1/4 on the day. Only a few Dow index stocks finished higher, led by Caterpillar, which was up 215/16 , to 5815/16 . The most actively traded stock on all markets, Intel, rose 113/16 , to 93 5/8, on volume of nearly 22 million shares.
While stocks fared better than bonds yesterday, it might be hard for them to move much higher if the bond market does not follow suit by rebounding next week.

HEADLINE: Mir Shadow Falls on Russian Role in Space

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: KOROLYOV, Russia

 BODY:
Forty years after launching the world's first satellite, Russia is struggling to conquer space on a shoestring.
The establishment that sought to beat the United States in the space race has been forced to contend with plummeting budgets, shaky political support and a drain on its scientific talent. 
 Now it has the Mir, the space station that has been plagued by accidents, malfunctions and crew problems.
The Mir's Spektr module was punctured in a collision with an unmanned cargo vessel on June 25. A new crew, blasting off on Aug. 5, is to try to restore full electrical power to the space station, and future crews may try to patch the hole, a repair job that has not even been tried in space before.
With NASA and the European space program paying hundreds of millions of dollars to station astronauts on the Mir, there is a lot riding on the repair effort. But the effort is also about national pride -- no small matter for the space establishment that put the first man in space and still operates the world's only space station.
If Russia can repair the Mir, it will demonstrate that it is still a vital repository of experience and expertise on space operations. Failure will be exploited by the growing legions of critics, who say that the glory days of the Russian space program are past and that NASA is endangering its astronauts by training them on the 11-year-old space station.
Nonetheless, the best and the brightest of Russia's space program are counting on the success of the repair mission. "My feeling is that after we think more, and make additional plans, we can restore almost everything on this space station," insisted Sergei Krikalyov, 38, the deputy flight controller, who has spent 15 months in space.
The space program that the Mir has come to symbolize has become increasingly fragmented since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. A commercial program for launching foreign satellites is largely successful. The Mir may have its troubles, but it is also long lived. Still, planetary science is being squeezed out in the battle for dwindling money.
The contrast with Soviet days is stark. During the cold war, in addition to a hefty budget for military space operations, Russia spent heavily on its civilian space program. In 1989, the civilian space budget was $3.2 billion, according to the Russian Space Agency.
Since then the civilian space budget has declined precipitously, to less than a tenth of that of the United States. Spending also lags behind the budgets of the Western Europeans and Japan. It is just slightly larger than India's space budget.
The budget crunch has its humiliations. Last year, the Mir and its crew were rented out for a Pepsi television commercial. A version of the Buran, the Soviet space shuttle that in 1988 flew only one mission, is an amusement park ride at Gorky Park in Moscow.
It has also injected a powerful note of uncertainty into space planning.
Last year, President Boris N. Yeltsin's Government was forced to rip up its own budget plan after it failed to collect enough taxes. The Government began distributing funds to Government ministries and agencies and then stopped mid-stream when the money ran out.
This year, budget politics again played havoc with the Russian Space Agency's plans. Parliament approved $650 million for 1997. But Yuri Koptev, the head of the agency, said in an interview that his agency would actually receive only $535 million.
That is hardly the only budget headache. Mr. Yeltsin has repeatedly promised the West that Russia will pay for and build a critical module for the navigation and control of a new international space station. Reflecting pride in their space station, the Russians have taken to calling the module Mir II.
Russia's failure to deliver the module on schedule -- a launching is set for late 1998 -- could delay the completion of the space station and lead to pressure to ease Russia out of the space-station consortium. So to insure its completion, the Yeltsin Government approved a special appropriation of $260 million this year in addition to the regular space agency budget.
But the space agency has yet to receive all of the money.
Mr. Koptev said the agency received $140 million in the form of Government-guaranteed credits from Russian banks. But then economic reformers in the Yeltsin Government decided that the practice violated budgetary discipline and shut off the credits.
To get the remaining $120 million, Mr. Koptev has asked Mr. Yeltsin to sign a decree, tapping funds provided to Russia from international organization like the International Monetary Fund and World Bank and other international organizations. Russian space officials expect Mr. Yeltsin to sign the decree next week.
The results of the monetary squeeze are apparent even in the secretive military Russian space program. In May, the Russians successfully launched a photo-reconnaissance satellite. Until that launching, the Russians had not had one in orbit for almost eight months, the longest gap since 1962.
In the civilian realm, the Russians have stopped maneuvering their communication satellites out of geosynchronous orbits as they near the end of their useful life, a standard practice to reduce the problem of space junk. Now they push the satellites to the limit and allow them to die in orbit.
They have also cut back on resupply missions to the Mir and delayed replacing its crews when the program ran out of booster rockets.
No area of space activity is harder hit than planetary science, which has taken a back seat to work on the space station.
During the cold war, some 1,500 scientists and support staff worked at the Soviet Space Research Institute to keep the Soviet Union on the cutting edge of space science. Now the staff has been cut by a third, and many of the scientists who are supposed to be working there actually spend valuable time away from the institute at their second or third jobs.
It is easy to understand why. The monthly salaries of scientists at the institute range from $87 to $175 for someone at the highest level.
"The number of personnel has diminished, and we have lost intellectual power," said Vyacheslav N. Linkin, a laboratory director at the institute.
Last year, the planetary program suffered a devastating setback when the launching of a Mars probe failed, sending the device crashing into South America. Russian scientists have been unable to identify the cause of the failure, which resulted in the loss of $180 million in scientific instruments because the Russians had decided not to send a vessel to monitor the launching to sea in order to save money.
Mr. Linkin said the institute needed to devise a cheaper research plan based on smaller payloads and booster rockets. Under the current plan, the main program to launch an astrophysics laboratory has been delayed to 1999, five years past its original launching date.
Because of these economic woes, the Russian space program has become increasingly dependent on foreign funds. This industrial town where the control center is situated is named after the legendary space designer Sergei Korolyov, whose very name was treated as a state secret in Soviet times. And a marble bust of a pensive Lenin still watches over the reception area at the Mission Control Center. But now the control center is festooned with a banner from Hewlett-Packard, the computer company.
According to Mr. Koptev, about 40 percent of Russia's production of rocket boosters and other space components is underwritten by foreign funds. NASA is paying the Russians $473 million over five years, mostly to train its astronauts and conduct experiments on the Mir.
The Russians are receiving another $190 million for one of the two modules the Russians are building for the new international space station. The module is being built by Russia's Khrunichev factory under a contract with Boeing.
Russia is also developing a successful business in launching foreign satellites for profit.
With their eye on the bottom line, the Russians have been careful not to let the drop in the production of space boosters affect their deadlines.
"Commercial launches is a big priority," said Geoffrey Perry, the head of the Kettering Group, based in England, a worldwide association of space observers. "They have not dumped a commercial payload."
Seeking to drum up business, Mr. Koptev insists that Russian space launchings are far less costly than in the West. Even so, he concedes, foreign funds are not a panacea.
"Our task is to get better financing from the state," he said.
Still, Russia also boasts some of the world's best and most experienced space scientists. They have vast experience in lifting large payloads into orbit and pioneered the space station. Russian astronauts also have unparalleled experience in long duration space travel.
And many Western experts say it would be a mistake to count the Russians out.
"They are alive, but in trouble," said Dr. Louis D. Friedman, the director of the Planetary Society, a nongovernmental organization, based in Pasadena, Calif., dedicated to space research. "The Russians have had extraordinary achievements in space, and losing them would mean losing a major part of the capability in space science."
At mission control, Mr. Krikalyov is staking his considerable reputation on success. The veteran astronaut was on the Mir when the Soviet Union collapsed and was forced to extend his stay. He was the first Russian to ride on the American space shuttle. And he has been selected to serve on the first crew of the new international space station.
Since the June 25 collision, however, Mr. Krikalyov has spent hours in a water tank and vacuum chamber trying to fix the Mir under conditions that approximate those in space.
Fixing the hole in the Mir is the hard part, he says, because it has never been done in outer space.
"We need to find out whether it possible to do this in a spacesuit," Mr. Krikalyov said during a break in his 15-hour day. "We need to see if the materials and tools can work in a vacuum."
American astronauts have likened life in Mir to a camping trip in a dirty old car.
American lawmakers have all but dubbed it a deathtrap.
But where critics see an anachronism, Mr. Krikalyov insists there is a proven design.
"If something happens with one module, you can seal it off and work in another module," he said admiringly. "The modular design of the space station is very successful."

HEADLINE: Yeltsin Backs Down in Tiff With Belarussian Over Arrests

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Aug. 1

 BODY:
Even as an international human rights organization met with the Belarussian authorities in Minsk to demand the release of three detained Russian reporters, President Boris N. Yeltsin retracted criticism of the Belarussian President today, and promised that the journalists' detention would not affect their relationship.
Human Rights Watch/Helsinki today published a searing 51-page report documenting President Aleksandr R. Lukashenko's systematic repression of civic organizations, opposition groups and the press. The report said Belarus "bears an eerie and increasing resemblance to Soviet society." 
 Long before the Belarussian President started his crackdown on Russian reporters, the West had condemned his increasingly bizarre and dictatorial behavior. In March, Belarus expelled a United States diplomat as a spy. And the United States has suspended $40 million in foreign aid to Belarus because of the country's human rights record.
But Moscow signed a reunification agreement with Mr. Lukashenko in May, and his growing campaign against the Russian press has made it increasingly difficult for Mr. Yeltsin to defend the merger.
On Wednesday, Mr. Yeltsin threatened to revoke the reunification treaty if Mr. Lukashenko did not free the reporters from the state-owned Russian network ORT who are in jail in Minsk and under investigation in connection with espionage, according to the Belarussian security services. They were arrested last week and charged with illegally crossing the Belarussian-Lithuanian border.
Mr. Lukashenko defied the Russian leader. "I will explain myself to Yeltsin," he told reporters, "after he explains the war launched against me by Russian TV channels."
His Government hauled 15 Russian and Western reporters who protested their colleagues' arrest into a Minsk courtroom today, fining 6 and releasing 8 others with a warning.
And today, his truculence paid off, at least in the Kremlin.
Mr. Lukashenko huffily canceled a visit to Kaliningrad today and lodged a complaint with the Russian Foreign Ministry after the local Governor asked him to postpone it because of concern over the fate of the Russian TV crew. Mr. Yeltsin's spokesman, Sergei Yastrzhembsky, said the Governor, Leonid Gorbenko, had acted unilaterally and "harmfully."
Mr. Yeltsin is under pressure from nationalists and Communists and many of his allies to press ahead with reunification. The President, who is vacationing in Samara, reconsidered his tough stance and tried to placate Mr. Lukashenko. Jocularly calling his counterpart, "young, quick-tempered and not as good at sweating criticism as I am," Mr. Yeltsin said today that the arrest of the Russian journalists "will not affect our cooperation or relations."
Mr. Yeltsin is particularly intent on not antagonizing Mr. Lukashenko these days because he did so more significantly in April, when he allowed his aides to dilute a charter on integration with Belarus on the eve of its signing. The first draft was hastily rewritten by economic reformers in the Russian Cabinet who feared the economic and political consequences of shackling Russia to its poor and backward neighbor.
That rebuke from the Kremlin has not chastened Mr. Lukashenko. He has resisted any attempts at reforming and decentralizing the economy and has instead turned his country of 10 million people into a kind of totalitarian biosphere. His Government routinely uses club-wielding riot policemen to break up demonstrations,and arrests and intimidates artists, dissidents and nationalist opponents.
In addition to the arrest of the reporters, Mr. Lukashenko has recently yanked the accreditations of a number of Russian TV network correspondents. In March, he expelled a correspondent from the privately owned Russian network NTV, whose alleged infractions included the fact that he had Israeli citizenship.
Mr. Lukashenko, who has spoken admiringly of Hitler and Stalin, disbanded Parliament last year when it refused to increase his powers. In April, he imposed a $3 million fine on the Belarussian branch of the Soros Foundation, on allegations of currency exchange violations. The foundation, which had invested $13 million in educational and civic projects, suspended its operations.
But, particularly in the wake of NATO expansion, reunification with Belarus remains a strong emotional issue for Russian nationalists. Some of Mr. Yeltsin's top foreign policy advisers, including Foreign Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov, have been lobbying to speed up integration as a response to the West's plans to expand NATO eastward.

HEADLINE: $1.2 Million For a Plan On the Future Of a Harbor

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN 

 BODY:
Hoping to win more than $1 billion in Federal funds to expand shipping in New York Harbor, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey has agreed to spend $1.2 million on a plan to revitalize wharves from Brooklyn to Bayonne.
The plan has to be completed before the Port Authority can compete for Federal aid. But it is also aimed at reassuring international shipping companies that both states are serious about keeping the harbor's channels deep enough, and cargo-handling equipment modern enough, to serve the tankers and giant container ships of the future, with drafts of 45 or 50 feet. 
 Confidence in the future of New York Harbor dimmed in recent years after channel dredging became paralyzed when New York and New Jersey could not agree on where to dump dredged silt, much of which contained traces of hazardous pollutants. The states are developing a list of repositories for the tainted mud but until now have never drawn up a thorough plan for modernizing the port, Port Authority officials said.
The plan, to be completed in six to nine months, will help determine how the states can get the most economic benefit from investments in new wharf space, cargo-handling equipment, roads and rail lines, said Chris Ward, the director of port redevelopment for the authority.
He said the flow of ships loaded with food, furniture and other goods to and from the East Coast was expected to double in 25 years. "All that traffic has to come through somewhere," he said, mentioning Philadelphia, Norfolk, Va., and Halifax, Nova Scotia, as competitors.
Mr. Ward said the analysis would favor neither the New York side of the harbor, where many piers sit idle, nor the New Jersey side, which has had the largest share of harbor commerce since the 1970's.
"It's not a New York-versus-New Jersey issue," Mr. Ward said. "We're going to need all of our assets. Whether it's Brooklyn or Staten Island, Newark or Bayonne, we're going to need it all in play to capture this growth."
Among other things, Mr. Ward said, the analysis will seek uses for the dredged mud. For example, it could be used as fill along deteriorated shorelines near existing wharves, he said, creating new space for handling cargo.
By deciding where the Port Authority should invest its resources, Mr. Ward said, the plan would also help shape a simultaneous study by the Federal Army Corps of Engineers that will assess the cost and benefits of deepening the harbor's main channels to 50 feet.
Tom Dowd, a professor of port and marine transportation management at the University of Washington in Seattle, said this kind of analysis is essential if New York Harbor is to flourish in the next century.
"Facilities, docks, channels, and equipment all have to be continually modified and modernized to stay competitive," he said. "Thirty years ago, if you wanted to move something to Chicago, you sent it through New York and put it on a truck. That's all changed."
New York Harbor's competitors are already busy with new plans of their own. In 1995, a direct rail link was opened between Halifax and the American Midwest, carrying double-decker train cars of containers. Partly as a result of that link, the amount of goods moving through the port is steadily rising, said Dennis Creamer, a vice president of the Halifax Port Corporation. "In 1997, we're up 30 percent from last year," he said.

White House Removes Ban On Latin American Arms
The Clinton Administration said it would end a ban on sales of advanced weapons to Latin American countries; the ban was imposed 19 years ago out of human rights concerns during an era of military dictatorships. 1
 
Mideast Recriminations Fly
After two suicide bombers killed 13 people in Jerusalem, Israel accused the Palestinian leadership of laxity towards terrorism, and Palestinian officials charged that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wanted the peace talks to fail. All but 2 of the 18 members of Yasir Arafat's Cabinet tendered their resignation, saying the Palestinian leader needed freedom to act in the crisis. 1 

Russian Space Heritage at Risk
Drastic budget cuts have challenged the survival of Russia's once proud space program, now readying its mission to repair the damaged space station Mir. 1
 
Yeltsin Placates Belarus Chief
President Boris Yeltsin of Russia retracted his criticism of President Aleksandr Lukashenko of Belarus, saying that relations between the two countries would not be affected by Mr. Lukashenko's detention of three Russian reporters on charges of espionage. International human rights organizations condemned the detentions and Mr. Lukashenko's authoritarian style of governing as bearing an "eerie and increasing resemblance to Soviet society." 5
 
Cease-Fire Eludes Algeria
Hopes that the Algerian Government's release of a leader of the Islamic Salvation Front, a militant group, would lead to a cease-fire and eventual peace were dashed by a spate of renewed violence. The military was reported to have swept into an insurgent area south of the capital, and shortly afterward more than 50 villagers were killed and mutilated in what many think was a response by the hard-line Armed Islamic Group. 3
 
Salvador Scion Jailed in Scandal
A prominent figure in El Salvador's governing right-wing party has been implicated in a scandal in which $115 million are missing from two investment companies he manages. Roberto Mathies Hill, from one of the wealthiest families in the country, has been jailed with four other business leaders for fraud. 4
 
Gypsies Seek Compensation
As Hungary's gypsies began to gather in Budapest to commemorate the deaths of half a million European gypsies in the Holocaust, a demand was made in Parliament seeking collective compensation for the tens of thousands of gypsies killed by Hungarian Nazis. Florian Farkas, who represents the country's 500,000 gypsies in Parliament, sought to widen an existing law that allows individual compensation cases. (Agence France-Presse)

'Senator No' Wields Fear As a Legislative Weapon
Senator Jesse Helms' ability to block single-handedly William F. Weld's nomination to be Ambassador to Mexico is only the latest example of a Washington axiom: Everyone is afraid of the Republican from North Carolina. Mr. Helms, chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations, has a decades-long history of using the Senate rules as a legislative roadblock to further his crusades against Communism and to press his conservative social agenda. His efforts to delay, in some cases halt, Presidential nominations or to sabotage legislation have earned him the nickname, "Senator No." 1
 
Cancers Feared From Fallout
Fallout from nuclear blasts at the Nevada Test Site near Las Vegas may have caused from 10,000 to 75,000 thyroid cancers, 70 percent of which have not yet been diagnosed, the National Cancer Institute said. Three-quarters of those cases are expected to develop in people who were younger than 5 at the time of exposure, which occurred in 1952, 1953, 1955 and 1957, the Institute said. Medical experts say that about 10 percent of such cancers are fatal. 6

U.P.S. Labor Talks Extended
The International Brotherhood of Teamsters let a 12:01 A.M. deadline pass without ordering a strike against the United Parcel Service as negotiators from the two sides held intense talks with a Federal mediator in their search for a settlement. 8

Indian Crafts, Made Abroad
As demand soared for American Indian arts and crafts in the 1980's, an American jewelry manufacturer set up a factory in a village in the southern Philippines. To increase sales, the manufacturer persuaded people there to rename their village Zuni after a distant and ancient people, the tribal residents of a desert corner of the American Southwest. Imitations are also being made in other developing nations. 6
 
The Benefits of Tax Cuts
Families with children, students and investors are not the only people who will benefit from the first Federal income tax cut in 16 years. Accountants, lawyers, tax preparers and publishers of tax books and software also expect to put a lot of money in their pockets from people paying them to learn how to take advantage of the tax breaks. 8

Suspect in Bomb Plot Had Order to Leave Country
Ghazi Abu Maizar, a primary suspect in a terrorist plot to detonate bombs in Brooklyn, had already been ordered by Federal officials to leave the United States by Aug. 23 as an illegal alien who had been caught sneaking into the country three times. In addition, the Palestinian had tried to appeal for political asylum by claiming that he would face persecution in Israel where he was, he said, wrongly regarded as a terrorist. 1

As local and Federal authorities worked to determine the scope of the apparent bomb plot, officials tightened security measures at transportation hubs, city landmarks and Jewish institutions across the metropolitan area and sought to reassure a jittery public. 24

Unemployment Falls Again
The economy entered the summer with fresh strength, as an unexpected number of new jobs dropped the nation's unemployment rate to 4.8 percent last month, matching a 23-year low set in May, Government figures showed. While analysts had predicted that the economy would rebound from a spring slowdown, the jobs data, combined with a private report on manufacturing, fanned fears that the rebound would be too strong. Investors, who have been pushing bond and stock prices higher on the belief that growth is moderate and inflation tame, wondered whether the Federal Reserve would now need to apply the brakes with an increase in interest rates. 1

HEADLINE: A Flip Side to E-Z Pass: East River Tolls and Rush-Hour Prices

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
Most drivers in the New York metropolitan area who have embraced the technology of electronic fare collection probably think about the E-Z Pass stickers on their cars and their little radio transponders only when they are passing through the tollbooths at places like the Tappan Zee or George Washington Bridges. That is when the system pays off for motorists, allowing them to avoid the long lines of people still using old-fashioned money.
But for the people who administer the region's highway systems, E-Z Pass represents far more than a time-saver. Collecting tolls is, in fact, only the beginning of what the system can do, and what it may hold in store in politics and economics as well as transportation. 
 Perhaps the most dramatic application, and almost certainly the most politically explosive one, concerns the question of applying electronic toll collection to places that do not now have tolls, like the East River bridge crossings into Manhattan. Although there is no move to impose new East River tolls, the idea has become, almost overnight, dramatically easier to put in place, at least in engineering terms.
Incentive pricing -- setting different toll amounts for different times of day to try to flatten out peaks in the rush hour -- has already become a reality because of E-Z Pass. The New York State Thruway Authority began a pilot project for off-peak pricing two weeks ago for trucks on the Tappan Zee and is studying whether to expand the system to include cars.
Odd new theoretical problems are emerging as well, like how to avoid "shoulders." (If you lower the fare for off-peak travel, how do you prevent having people pulling over to wait for the lower rate?) And old problems continue to haunt. (If you lower a toll at one time of day, the bond covenants that govern revenue flow at agencies like the Thruway Authority require that you raise another toll.)
"It really goes to the heart of how we're going to manage the transportation system of the future," said Emil H. Frankel, a lawyer and former Commissioner of Transportation for Connecticut.
Mr. Frankel and other transportation experts said that some of the ideas swirling around E-Z Pass technology remain largely theoretical -- but only because they have not been tried, not because they are impossible, as was the case in the past.
When William Vickrey, the Columbia University professor who is generally considered the father of incentive pricing strategies, first proposed his ideas in 1959, no way existed to make them work. A tollbooth clerk could not calculate different fares for different times of day without making everything worse.
Professor Vickrey died last October, shortly after receiving the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science for his work -- too soon to see what experts say E-Z Pass can do. "It has moved pricing from academia into the offices of transportation executives," Mr. Frankel said. "It doesn't get us over the political hurdles, but it does allow us to think about it."
As with any profound change, especially one that cuts so close to political hot-buttons like taxation, the discussion of E-Z Pass is full of awkwardness and uncertainty.
Two weeks ago, for example, when the Thruway Authority eliminated the 40-cent passenger toll in Spring Valley near the Tappan Zee, it decided to make up the lost revenue by raising the fare on the bridge itself to $3, from $2.50 -- at least for regular old-fashioned toll payers. E-Z Pass holders making 17 or more trips across the bridge each month were spared -- their fare was kept the same, at $1 per trip.
The decision, transportation experts say, is the complete opposite of most of the accepted goals of traffic management, which aims at spreading out or reducing traffic: It created an economic reward for greater travel. A driver who uses the bridge a lot pays less.
The authority's chairman, Howard E. Steinberg, said the problem his agency faced in that question, as it will in the study of incentive pricing, is that it did not want to penalize people who might have no other choice but to travel when they do.
"Commuters going to and from work tend to have less flexibility, and we wouldn't want to penalize people," Mr. Steinberg said.
Some transportation agencies, notably the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, have decided not to even think about questions like that. The agency, which administers many of the bridge and tunnel crossings within New York City, requested proposals for a study of incentive pricing systems in December, but then shelved the idea in March. Critics said the agency was afraid of the E-Z Pass implications for the East River bridges.
A spokeswoman for the M.T.A., Lisa Schwartz, said the board thought the issue should be looked at "regionally" first and wanted to see what the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and the Thruway Authority experienced before charging ahead.
For decades, the two main obstacles to the idea of putting tolls on East River crossings like the Brooklyn and Manhattan Bridges centered on physical constraints and air quality. The old stand-in-line system required huge toll plazas that at various times of day could turn into parking lots of idling vehicles. That meant lots of land -- a dear commodity on either side of the river -- and lots of pollution.
Both those objections have been severely weakened, if not swept away, by automatic toll collection. Though there would still have to be tollbooths for people using cash, the waiting time -- and thus the resulting space and air quality issues -- would be reduced by widespread E-Z Pass use.
And New Yorkers are using the system. Port Authority officials said yesterday that about 22 percent of the cars crossing the George Washington Bridge were using E-Z Pass, five days after it started there.
The Thruway Authority has on its drawing board what it calls a "virtual tollbooth," which Mr. Steinberg said would probably first be tried on a stretch of the Gov. Thomas E. Dewey Thruway, but which would have applications for bridge travel as well. Because the E-Z Pass receivers read a car's stickers even at high speeds, drivers may no longer have to cruise slowly through a tollbooth at 5 miles per hour as they do now. E-Z Pass can dispense with booths, and plazas, and, for that matter, with toll-collecting employees.
Administrators are also learning how to avoid the "shoulders" that can be created as fares fluctuate. On the Tappan Zee, commercial truck drivers who are being discouraged from traveling during rush hour face incrementally increased fares as the morning and evening rush hours begin. The fares go back down at the end of peak periods, but the incremental changes are stretched out over 45 minutes, going up about $1 every 15 minutes depending on the size of the truck. This is so gradual, officials say, that drivers have little incentive to stop and wait for a more favorable rate to come along.

HEADLINE: Sales of Indian Crafts Rise and So Do Fakes

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: ZUNI, N.M.

 BODY:
Displayed for tourists in an "Indian jewelry" store in Albuquerque, the bracelets, pendants and rings were labeled "Made in Zuni." Precise labels would have read: Zuni, Philippines.
As demand soared for American Indian arts and crafts in the 1980's, an American jewelry manufacturer set up an assembly factory in a village in the southern Philippines. To increase sales, the manufacturer persuaded people there to rename their village after a distant and ancient people, the tribal residents of this desert corner of the American Southwest. 
 "In the Philippines, they are copying this design," Loren Panteah said as he sat at his workbench here overlooking the Zuni River and Sacred Corn Mountain. Mr. Panteah held up a $90 pair of earrings he had fashioned using tribal symbols and techniques and working with silver, turquoise, lapis lazuli and jet.
The developing nations are undercutting the United States' own underdeveloped pockets, as copies are made in the Philippines and elsewhere, and American and European shoppers snap up "Indian" arts and crafts.
Brazilians, Nigerians and Pakistanis weave copies of Apache, Navajo and Pima baskets. Mexicans weave imitation Navajo blankets. Chinese carve animal fetishes. Thai workers make imitation jewelry, sometimes using blue plastic instead of turquoise stone and a nickel-zinc alloy for silver. Filipino workers specialize in Hopi kachina dolls as well as Zuni inlaid jewelry.
Estimating that foreign fakes had cut his income by one-third in the last five years, Mr. Panteah said the impact had rippled across the impoverished Zuni Indian Reservation in remote western New Mexico.
"A lot of families are really hurting," he said. "They have had their vehicles taken, their lights cut off."
Hardest hit are the Hopis, Navajos and Zunis, three tribes with styles that account for about 90 percent of the Southwest Indian jewelry sold today. In Zuni land, a high-altitude desert expanse of about 700 square miles, cottage craft industries have long helped to ease unemployment, officially calculated at 74 percent in a tribal work force of 5,000 adults. For the Zunis' northern neighbors, the Navajo, blanket weaving and jewelry making have traditionally brought cash to a society in which the average household income is about $10,000, barely one-third of New Mexico's state average.
Even though it is illegal to pass off the fakes as real Indian crafts, the imitators are bold.
"Hopi style, Navajo style and Zuni style -- we are distributors for some of the best silversmiths Asia has to offer," reads the Internet catalogue of Buck-A-Gram, a Bangkok jewelry company run by a Connecticut man. "To those of you who think our jewelry is worth less because it was not made by an American Indian, the truth is that it is estimated that 90 percent of all Indian goods sold as genuine are actually imported."
Although estimates vary, foreign fakes are now believed to account for as much as half of the market in Indian arts and crafts, worth $1 billion a year.
In the Southwest, non-Indians have been copying Indian arts and crafts ever since the first tourist markets sprang up there a little more than a century ago. But with the modern interest in all things Indian, counterfeiting has surged, with increases in both quantity and in quality.
Low foreign wages and mass production are depressing prices, said Andy Abeita, an Isleta Pueblo Indian and sculptor who is president of the Indian Arts and Crafts Association, a nonprofit group in Albuquerque.
"Import jewelry is no longer a trinket industry," said Mr. Abeita, whose group is dedicated to protecting and promoting authentic Indian crafts. "Now it is very difficult for the artists themselves to tell if a piece is Indian handmade or not."
The Customs Service has begun a half-dozen investigations into imports of Indian-style arts and crafts, focusing on Mexico, the Philippines and Taiwan, said Connie Fenchel, the director of investigative operations at the agency.
"We are investigating people who are smuggling and disseminating this jewelry," Ms. Fenchel said.
Under the Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990, which was fully put into effect only in November, it is illegal to sell or display for sale any product not made by Indians in a way that falsely suggests that it was. A first-time violator faces fines up to $250,000 and jail terms up to five years. Repeat violators face penalties of up to $1 million in fines and 15 years in jail.
A Federal law also requires that Indian-style products imported into the United States be indelibly marked with the country of origin. Many importers flout this law by affixing stickers that can be peeled off. Some of these Indian-style goods are "laundered" in Gallup, a busy trading-post town where the origin of the goods is obscured. Out-of-state buyers, many of whom know that the goods are fake, stock up in Gallup and then peddle Asian-made wares as "straight from the reservation."
"It's not turquoise -- it's plastic," said Susan McGuire, executive director of the Indian Arts and Crafts Association, a group of artists, dealers, collectors and museum officials. "It's not Zuni; it's Filipino. It's not straight from the reservation; it's straight from Manila."
To combat counterfeits, the association has conducted seminars this spring for customs agents and for investigators of the New Mexico Attorney General's Office. Although 10 states have laws against marketing imports as "Indian handmade," prosecutions have been rare.
In Santa Fe in August, 100,000 people are expected to gather for the city's 76th annual Indian Market, where about 1,200 Indian artists are expected to display their wares.
Imitations are rare at that market.
"It's not common at the Indian Market because people know that if they are caught, they are out," said Paul Rainbird, a market organizer.
Fakes often penetrate markets elsewhere, especially ones far from the Southwest.
At the Red Earth powwow last month in Oklahoma City, "there was one Santo Domingo Pueblo lady selling Philippine jewelry with her name scratched on the back," said Tony Eriacho, a Zuni jewelery maker and dealer. "Outside, a couple of Navajo families were selling Philippine jewelry as Indian jewelry."
To avoid fraud, buyers should ask sellers for written certification that names the tribal artist and the stones and natural materials used in producing the product.
Under New Mexico law, "Indian handmade" means using tools and processes that allow the maker to determine individual shapes and design. In contrast, "Indian crafted" refers to assembly-line production, usually by Indians employed in factories in the Albuquerque area.
To protect tribal artisans, the Hopi, the Navajo and the Zuni are debating the formal adoption of tribal trademarks. These marks could be used only by tribal artists who would agree to abide by trademark restrictions.
On a survey form of tribal jewelers and traders on the problem of imitation jewelry, one Zuni artisan printed in bold letters, "We all suffer -- time to take on the fakes."

Robust Growth Seen In July Jobs Report
An unexpectedly large number of jobs were created in July -- 316,000 -- well above expectations and above a revised 228,000 jobs in June. As a result, the nation's unemployment rate declined to 4.8 percent last month, matching a 23-year low set in May, Government figures showed. 
 A separate report, from the National Association of Purchasing Management, showed that manufacturing expanded in July. The two reports raised fears that the economy might be growing too fast to keep inflation contained and some asked if the Federal Reserve would need to apply brakes to the economy and raise interest rates. [Page 1.]
 
Airbus Wins 2 Big Orders
Virgin Atlantic Airways and Air Canada have placed orders worth $3.9 billion with Airbus Industrie for stretch versions of its largest passenger plane. The European consortium's four-engine aircraft, which can carry up to 378 passengers, is intended to compete with the Boeing 747 jumbo jet. [32.]
 
No Strike at United Parcel
The International Brotherhood of Teamsters decided not to order a strike against the United Parcel Service as negotiators for the two sides continued to meet with a Federal mediator. The company and the union were optimistic that they could resolve their differences without a strike by the 185,000 unionized drivers, loaders and sorters. [8.]
 
Agreement Reached in Steel Strike
Negotiators reached a tentative agreement yesterday to end a 10-month strike by 4,500 workers at Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel. The agreement to end the walkout by the United Steelworkers at plants in Ohio, West Virginia and Pennsylvania came after 10 straight days of negotiations in New York. Union officials and the full membership must still ratify the deal. Workers are expected to return to their jobs in about two weeks. [7.]
 
Dollar Hits a High vs. Mark
The dollar hit an eight-year high against the German mark and surged in most other currency dealings, propelled by strong United States economic data. The dollar closed at 1.8635 marks after setting an intraday high of 1.8675 marks, the strongest since November 1989. But the dollar slipped to 118.40 Japanese yen, from 118.59 yen on Thursday. [41.]
 
Seeking On-Line Updike Wannabes
Amazon.com, the on-line bookseller, has developed a contest that is part lottery, part chain letter. Amazon.com is asking imitation John Updikes to write the middle of a short story the author has started about a Miss Tasso Polk. A winner will be chosen each day, with a grand-prize winner selected at random in the fall. The epic will be called "The Greatest Tale Ever Told." [11.]
 
Gasoline Prices Increase
Gasoline surged after Shell Netherlands unexpectedly closed part of Europe's second-largest oil refinery, the latest in a spate of problems for gasoline that pushed prices up 20 percent last month. On other markets, platinum rose and copper fell. [41.]
 
2 Ski Resorts Acquired
ASC Holdings, the parent of the American Skiing Company, has bought the Steamboat Ski Resort in Steamboat Springs, Colo., and Heavenly Ski Resort in Stateline, Nev., for $288.3 million. American Skiing acquired its first ski area in the West in April when it purchased Canyons Ski Resort, in Park City, Utah. [33]
 
Reshuffling at G.E.
General Electric named Eugene F. Murphy as a vice chairman, corporate executive officer and a director, amid a reshuffling of several executives. [45.]
 
Nomura to Spin Off a Unit
Nomura Securities Company's United States subsidiary plans to spin off its real estate lending unit, one of its most profitable businesses, into a private company, paving the way for a possible sale. The real estate group at Nomura provides the bulk of the firm's profits in the United States by making loans using Nomura's capital. Those loans are then packaged into securities and sold to investors. Last year, Nomura was the fourth-biggest underwriter of commercial mortgage-backed securities.[34]

HEADLINE: Report Shows Robust Growth With New Jobs

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 1

 BODY:
The United States economy entered the summer with fresh strength, as an unexpected number of new jobs reduced the nation's unemployment rate to 4.8 percent last month, matching a 23-year low set in May, Government figures showed today.
While analysts had predicted that the economy would rebound from a spring slowdown, today's data on jobs, combined with a private report on manufacturing, fanned fears that the rebound might be too strong. Some investors, who have been pushing bond and stock prices higher on the belief that growth is moderate and inflation tame, wondered whether the Federal Reserve would now need to apply the brakes with an increase in interest rates. 
 "We've kind of shattered the old conviction of no Fed tightening," said Richard B. Hoey, chief economist at the Dreyfus Corporation.
Bond and stock prices tumbled after the report, although stocks later recovered. The Dow Jones industrial average, which earlier fell 1 percent, ended the day down 28.57 points, or less than half a percent. Bond prices, however, continued to slide, driving the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond -- a benchmark for consumer interest rates like mortgages -- to 6.45 percent, from 6.29 percent on Thursday. Bond prices and their yields move in opposite directions.
While the employment report revived Wall Street's fears of higher interest rates -- which eat into corporate profits and make bonds less attractive -- it confirmed the improved position of job seekers. The unemployment rate for black teen-agers, for example, fell by more than four percentage points, to 28.6 percent, the lowest since 1969.
Over all, 316,000 jobs were added to the nation's payrolls last month, well above expectations and above a revised 228,000 jobs in June. When combined with a modest increase in the labor force, the jobless ranks contracted by 253,000 and the unemployment rate fell to 4.8 percent, from 5 percent in June -- matching the rate in May and the lowest since November 1973.
At the same time, however, the average hourly earnings of production workers were unchanged while their weekly earnings fell because of a shorter workweek.
The Clinton Administration applauded the July jobs report.
"This morning we have further evidence that the strategy of balancing the budget while investing in our people and selling more American products around the world has helped to produce sustained prosperity for Americans," President Clinton said today. "There is no doubt that the economic strategy we put in place in 1993 created the conditions for the extraordinary private-sector growth."
July's gains in jobs showed that the May report was no fluke, said Nicholas S. Perna, economist for the Fleet Financial Group in Boston. "The most important thing is that the unemployment rate is clearly below 5 percent again," he said.
Mr. Perna and other economists worry that such low unemployment will soon drive up wages and spur inflation.
Further signs of economic growth came in a survey today by the National Association of Purchasing Management. The association's report, which covers manufacturing, showed its overall index rising to 58.6 from 55.7, while the production index leaped by 8.4 points, to 64.4.
Rising for the first time in four months, the group's price index surged to 53.6 from 48.1, with 17 percent of members reporting paying higher prices compared with 13 percent in May and June. The index of supplier deliveries climbed to 55.3 from 54.6, which the association said meant that "deliveries are slowing at a faster rate."
In other reports, the Commerce Department said that orders placed with factories rose 1.2 percent in June, more than recovering a drop of five-tenths of 1 percent in May. The department also said that Americans' income grew six-tenths of 1 percent in June, while spending rose three-tenths of 1 percent.
While today's reports raised expectations that Federal Reserve policy makers might increase rates, few analysts expect them to do so at their next meeting on Aug. 19.
Macroeconomic Advisers, a St. Louis consulting firm, told clients today that "despite the continued benign behavior of wages, the further tightening of labor markets will be of concern to the Fed and keeps the possibility of a tightening alive, although almost certainly not before" the Fed's September meeting.
The 316,000 jump in employer payrolls last month was well above expectations, though the total was swollen by a 48,000 increase in local education that was statistically suspect because of changing seasonal patterns of the school year. Teachers are considered employed year-round, but others, like cafeteria workers and sports referees, move on and off education payrolls and may or may not take unrelated jobs.
But the report showed a 31,000 advance in health service jobs following an unusually weak June, a 65,000 surge in retail trade -- half in restaurants and bars -- and a 26,000 gain for the finance-insurance-real estate category that was more than twice the monthly average over the last year.
Factory jobs, however, were flat with 20,000 additional people producing durable goods more than offset by 25,000 fewer producing nondurables.
The workweek shortened by 18 minutes and factory overtime also fell, suggesting to some that employers were confident enough to add permanent workers, which tends to reduce the need for long hours. The index of aggregate weekly hours fell seven-tenths of a point, to 139.9.
Another reflection of July strength, analysts said, was the resumed increase in the percentage of the unemployed who voluntary left their latest job, typically because they thought they could readily find another one. This percentage was 12.6 percent in July, up from 12.2 in May and June and 11.2 in April.
By region, the West showed the most improvement, with its July unemployment rate declining three-tenths of a point, to 5.3 percent. The Northeast and Midwest posted two-tenths of a point declines, to 5.5 percent and 3.6 percent, respectively, while the South edged down to 5 percent from 5.1.

HEADLINE: In Washington, Few Trifle With Jesse Helms

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE and STEVEN LEE MYERS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 1

 BODY:
Senator Jesse Helms's ability to block William F. Weld's nomination to be Ambassador to Mexico, single-handedly, is only the latest example of a Washington axiom: Everyone is afraid of the Republican from North Carolina.
President Clinton was so intent on not crossing Mr. Helms, White House aides said, that he was careful to offer only a tepid endorsement of Mr. Weld as an aside in a speech this week. 
 Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican leader who is not generally timid about meddling with his committee chairmen, turned aside private pleas from some other Republicans to challenge Mr. Helms on this nomination.
Even Democratic colleagues have chosen not to go against Mr. Helms, though he is as much a beacon of unsparing conservatism as Senator Edward M. Kennedy is of unsparing liberalism.
Mr. Helms, chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations, has a decades-long history of using the Senate rules as a legislative roadblock to further his crusades against Communism and to press his conservative social agenda. His often-successful efforts to delay, in some cases halt, Presidential nominations or to sabotage legislation have earned him the sobriquet Senator No.
Asked in an interview today how Mr. Helms commanded such power, Bob Dole, the former Senate Republican leader, said of the political establishment: "They're afraid of him. Jesse runs a pretty tight ship."
Though he has forged a strong relationship with Mr. Helms, Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, the ranking Democrat on the committee, was blunter. "He's prepared to be mean," Mr. Biden said. "He's prepared to be disliked. He's prepared to be ostracized."
But Mr. Helms's leverage is rooted in more than his image as an intractable extremist. Even as he refuses to budge on Mr. Weld, Mr. Helms is working closely with the Clinton Administration on a host of issues, most notably efforts to pay off back dues to the United Nations and to reorganize the State Department.
Mr. Helms and Madeleine K. Albright, the Secretary of State, have become so close that they greet each other with kisses. Two and a half years into Mr. Helms's tenure as chairman, his relationship with Ms. Albright is producing substantive agreements on foreign policy.
The two are so chummy that Administration officials said they did not want to jeopardize that bond for the sake of Mr. Weld, a moderate Republican who resigned as Governor of Massachusetts this week to devote himself to pressing for his confirmation. (Ms. Albright has talked to Mr. Helms about the Weld nomination, her senior aides said, but has not pressed him especially hard.)
Chatting in the lobby of a Las Vegas hotel this week after Mr. Clinton resisted delivering a more effusive endorsement of Mr. Weld, John Podesta, a deputy chief of staff who is shepherding the nomination through the Senate, said, "We don't need to add a new log on to the fire of antagonism."
 
A Willingness To Say 'Hell, No'
The sources of Mr. Helms's power are his deeply held convictions, his stubborn streak and his lack of concern about what people say about him. And unlike many of his colleagues, Mr. Helms has no hesitation to exercise his power, and to seize on every parliamentary maneuver that exists to press his causes.
Most senators, for instance, would not dare use their authority to refuse to schedule a hearing on a Presidential nomination, as Mr. Helms has done in the Weld case.
And because Mr. Helms, who is 75, has been something of an icon in the conservative movement since he was first elected in 1972, many Republicans are loath to take him on, for fear of offending that segment of their party's voting base.
"The Senate club is not a place where you have a lot of guys who got there because they were willing to say, 'Hell, no.' " said Richard S. Williamson, a former aide to President Ronald Reagan who has known Mr. Helms since they both worked together on the 1976 Republican Party platform.
Mr. Williamson added: "The nature of politics is to try to gather support and be collegial. Someone who is willing to stand alone is always going to have disproportionate influence."
Mr. Helms's iron-fisted control, and the end of the cold war, have discouraged senators from serving on the once-coveted Foreign Relations Committee. Of Mr. Helms's 10 Republican colleagues on the panel, 7 are freshmen. His control also reflects Mr. Helms's intense belief in preserving Senate traditions.
Several authorities on Congress said former Senator Howard Metzenbaum, a liberal Democrat from Ohio, was the only other senator in recent times who was willing to exert power to the maximum extent possible, even at the expense of inconveniencing or thwarting colleagues.
"They all do it," said Ross K. Baker, a political scientist at Rutgers University, "but usually they do it less offensively and with less callous disregard for the consequences.
"At the same time, Helms is respected. He is not viewed as a Joe McCarthy, someone who bring the Senate in disgrace. He has extremely firm convictions and believes in using every parliamentary device at his disposal to achieve his objectives."
Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader, praised Mr. Helms, saying he "virtually cleared the calendar of ambassadorial nominations." Yet Mr. Daschle said that when Mr. Helms dragged matters out like with Mr. Weld, it bogged down the institution.
"If every chairman would take that kind of action," he said, "it would be impossible for us to conduct the business of the Senate."
Trying to halt the appointment of ambassadors has been a Helms speciality. In 1987, for example, Mr. Helms fought bitterly with the then committee chairman, Senator Claiborne Pell, Democrat of Rhode Island, over a nomination for Ambassador to Portugal.
Mr. Pell pressed for confirmation, arguing that it was important to "get on with the nation's business."
Mr. Helms replied, "Bull!"
Mr. Helms lost the fight, and dived into a speech as Mr. Pell tried to cut him off.
"You cannot take the floor away from me," Mr. Helms declared. "If you railroad me, Mr. Chairman, you'll regret it."
 
A Hard-Liner Finds Some Unlikely Allies
When Republicans gained control of the Senate after the 1994 elections, sweeping him into the chairmanship of the Foreign Relations Committee, Mr. Helms appeared determined to live up to his reputation, developed by years in the minority, as an extremist, an obstructionist, an isolationist.
Even before the 104th Congress convened, he declared Mr. Clinton unfit to be Commander in Chief and suggested he "better have a bodyguard" if he decided to visit a military base in North Carolina. Things did not improve.
After striking what he thought was a bargain with Warren Christopher, who was then Secretary of State, to reorganize the State Department, Mr. Helms was infuriated when the White House backed off.
So for months, Mr. Helms halted all meetings of the committee, thereby stalling ratification of a dozen treaties and freezing 400 promotions in the State Department. He also refused to hold hearings for dozens of ambassador nominations, prompting Mr. Christopher to complain that the impasse had created "management and morale problems."
Eventually, Mr. Helms yielded and the committee resumed work. Mr. Clinton, facing re-election last year, also showed a willingness to compromise, and the turning point was probably when he signed Mr. Helms's legislation to tighten the economic embargo of Cuba.
But the Administration's designated charmer is the Secretary of State. Ms. Albright, who visited Mr. Helms in North Carolina while still delegate to the United Nations last year, spent a day with Mr. Helms again this year, delivering a speech, planting a kiss on the Senator's cheek in his hometown and presenting him with a T-shirt that read, "Someone in the State Department Loves Me." She danced with him at her 60th birthday party. And her softball team challenged his (and lost, 8 to 4).
Though Ms. Albright is a creature of the Democratic Party, she and Mr. Helms seem to share a genuine affection. Aides to both say it springs from his respect for her patriotism as a refugee who found a home in the United States and from shared anti-Communist zeal.
In addition to Ms. Albright, Mr. Helms has also developed a respectful relationship with Stuart E. Eizenstat, the new Under Secretary of State for Economic and Business Affairs. And he has worked well with Erskine B. Bowles, Mr. Clinton's chief of staff, whose father, Hargrove Bowles, was a friend of Mr. Helms since grade school in North Carolina.
These ties have produced results. After vowing to block a vote on the chemical weapons treaty earlier this year, Mr. Helms relented and allowed it to reach the Senate floor. He still voted against it, and forced the Administration to give assurances on how the treaty would be enforced.
The relationship with Ms. Albright also led to agreement on legislation to reorganize the State Department and to pay off the dues to the United Nations, long a bete noire of conservatives.
Just this week, as the House and Senate met to hash out differences in the State Department legislation, Mr. Helms held fast in a dispute over how many under secretaries a reorganized State Department should have. Insisting on the current level of five, Mr. Helms exclaimed, "The question is, Are we going to control the bureaucracy or aren't we?"
By the next morning, the Senator from North Carolina had changed his tone. He told his colleagues that he had spoken again by telephone with Ms. Albright, who was in Asia.
"She said she wasn't dressed yet," Mr. Helms said, noting that it was morning in Asia when they had spoken. In an apparent reference to telephones that transmit people's faces, he said, "I said I'm glad we don't have television."
He then conceded the fight to Ms. Albright, agreeing to allow her to have a sixth under secretary.
"I want her to continue the good job she's doing," Mr. Helms said.
 
Policy Differences Are Just the Beginning
 Gov. Tommy G. Thompson of Wisconsin, a Republican who is close to both Mr. Helms and Mr. Weld, offered some advice for the two men to patch things up over a bratwurst. "The two of them need to go out and have a beer," he said. "It would be a little rocky at the beginning, but I think they would get it done."
Marc Thiessen, Mr. Helms' spokesman, brushed aside the suggestion with a laugh, saying, "Helms doesn't drink beer."
Beer or no beer, Mr. Helms and Mr. Weld have never met, and that prospect seems increasingly unlikely. In his only lengthy interview on the subject of nomination for Mexico, Mr. Helms said on Fox News earlier this summer, "I don't think he is ambassador quality."
Given the problems with drug trafficking in Mexico, Mr. Helms has said he could not condone an ambassador to that country who, like Mr. Weld, supports the use of marijuana for medicinal purposes. But he said there were other reasons as well for his opposition to the nomination.
People close to Mr. Weld speculate that Edwin Meese 3d, the former Attorney General, was pressing Mr. Helms to reject Mr. Weld. Mr. Weld was denounced by conservatives when he resigned as head of the criminal division of the Justice Department in 1988 to protest Mr. Meese's policies. But in an interview, Mr. Meese denied that he had spoken to Mr. Helms.
"I'm staying completely away from anything to do with Weld," he said.
Mr. Helms's advisers noted that beyond the drug issue -- and Mr. Weld's liberal positions on social matters like abortion and homosexual marriages -- there were plenty of other reasons Mr. Weld had not endeared himself to the Senator.
In a debate last October, in Mr. Weld's bid to unseat Senator John F. Kerry, the moderator asked the Governor, "If you are elected, will you vote in the Republican caucus to reconfirm Jesse Helms as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee?"
The Governor sidestepped the question, responding, "You know, you never know whether incumbents are going to get re-elected," adding that he would have to "wait and see when I get down exactly what all those votes I would cast would be."
Asked last week whether he regretted his response to that question, Mr. Weld said, simply, "No."
Beyond slights and ideology, some of Mr. Helms's friends said the Senator dislikes Mr. Weld for the same reason he was never close to President George Bush: he has a disdain for politicians who came out of the Ivy League Eastern establishment.
"This may seem overly cynical, but I told Jesse, 'You know what this is about? He thinks you're tacky -- the tackiest of all,' " said David Keene, chairman of the American Conservative Union, referring to Mr. Weld. "This guy is a rich patrician dilettante. And I think he thinks it's beneath him to talk to Jesse Helms or the other hoi polloi."
Mr. Helms's advisers said any hope that the Senator would sit down with Mr. Weld were dashed when the latter asserted publicly that his appointment was being held up because of "ideological extortion."
"Weld does not want to be Ambassador to Mexico," said Mr. Thiessen, the Senator's spokesman. "Weld is using his appointment as a tool to start an intra-party battle for the soul of the Republican Party. And he's using Jesse Helms as his foil. That's an abuse of the confirmation process, and an abuse of the U.S. Senate."
Mr. Dole said Mr. Helms could be difficult but not completely obstinate.
"I never had a time where if I went to Jesse personally and said, 'This is very important to me or the President,' where we couldn't work it out," he said.
Echoing many others, Mr. Dole described Mr. Helms as a gentleman. "My mother-in-law had her 96th birthday in May," he said. "Who calls her up and wishes her a happy birthday? Jesse."
In late June, Mr. Dole said, he was in Boston and tried to meet with Mr. Weld so he could offer to broker talks between him and Mr. Helms. But Mr. Weld was in Hong Kong. Mr. Dole said he left a message for the Governor, but never heard from him.
"I wanted to give him a little free advice," Mr. Dole said. "I didn't reach him -- and nobody called me back."

HEADLINE: Kill an Elephant, Save an Elephant

BYLINE: By Matthew Scully; Matthew Scully, a speechwriter in the Bush Administration, is a free-lance writer.

DATELINE: ARLINGTON, Va.

 BODY:
You'd think that after a century's worth of service as the noble Republican symbol, the elephant might enjoy some special conservation status in the party. But it was a Democrat, Senator Barbara Boxer of California, who rose the other day in its defense.
By voice vote, the Senate approved her motion to restrict American financing for Campfire, a program in Zimbabwe under which elephant hunting is allowed as a means of raising local revenue. 
 By the logic of Campfire, the only way to save the elephant is to turn him over to the hunter. Around the world are hunters willing to pay good money for an elephant. Surrounding the elephant preserves are poor communities that could certainly use the revenue. So, the argument runs, give those communities control over elephants, and let them sell the hunting rights at premium rates. They will thus have an incentive to guard against poachers. From now on, only paying customers get to hunt.
The idea of trophy hunters as the elephant's only deliverance from poachers may not sit well with some of us, but such is life. Best, we're told, to avert our eyes and let Market Forces work another miracle. Campfire, as one proponent put it in The Weekly Standard, has "transformed elephants from economic liabilities into community assets," thereby "empowering the peasants."
The economics do seem to add up, but one thing I notice in all these arguments is that we never meet the Market Force himself, the trophy hunter upon whose money and conservation instincts the whole plan rests. To see how Campfire is playing out on the consumer end, go on line sometime, key in "hunting" and "elephant" and you'll find dozens of safari outfitters advertising what looks to be a trophy free-for-all. "Come to Tanzania," says one company, "the very essence of Africa, unspoiled yet spectacular." The "Big Four" -- elephants, lions, leopards, buffalo -- are all there. And best of all, "You may shoot as much as you please."
Come to Zimbabwe, beckons Matupula Hunters of Texas, for "Africa's best elephant hunting." And hurry: "With the country dry and surface water limited, the elephant bulls can be tracked going to and from water, or in amongst the woodlands and forest where they feed and lay up."
Let me explain: It's hot and dry. The creatures live in a fenced game park where water is scarce. Though wary of the water hole, they have to drink sometime, and when they do you'll be positioned just right. Catching them en route makes for "an exciting and rewarding elephant hunt."
A few restrictions still apply. "No Elephants are allowed to be hunted in Mozambique," says Hunt Mozambique Inc. You can stay for that tempting "Lion and Buffalo Package" ($13,450) or head over to Zimbabwe where the action is. Daily rates there cover "accommodation in fully equipped tented safari camp, camp personnel, all meals, daily laundry service, trackers and skinners, field preparation of trophies, vehicle transport during hunt, services of PH" -- professional hunter. With Dembe Safaris you'll have a hunt "reminiscent of Hemingway," unless you prefer "luxurious 5-star lodges with swimming pools, TV, and all the amenities."
But for skinner and PH, one notices, all these are things a tourist armed only with camera would pay for, which makes you wonder why nonhunting tourism (let alone nontourism trades) could not just as well support those communities. On the other hand, then we could not don safari suits and feel like Hemingway. We would miss the rewarding experience of being fed, tidied up, tucked in, served breakfast, driven up to a trapped and thirsty animal -- on his best day, about as hard to hit as Bullwinkle floating down Fifth Avenue -- and after our kill repairing to the hotel bar to swap stories, while the empowered peasants handle the skinning and stuffing back in the bush.
Adventures Unlimited lays down what seems to be the standard rule: "Trophy fees payable when animals are killed or wounded." The fees: "Elephant -- $10,000; Giraffe -- $1,000; Lion -- $3,500; Hippo -- $2,500." At just $700 the zebras are a steal, and for $75 you can shoot yourself some "Bait" -- an impala.
 There are pictures, too. A client of Adventures Unlimited, a meager fellow bearing some serious weaponry, grins at us through the now horizontal tusks of an elephant that has just been transformed into a community asset. The great elephant, all $10,000 worth, looks asleep.
Oh, and you can also enjoy vicarious adventures through videos like "Pure Africa" ("lots of action and kill shots"), "Sudden Death" ("wounded trophy lions") or, for the gals, "Lady Africa."
There are now 500,000 or so elephants left across the continent, down from roughly 1.3 million in 1979. Your average adult is maybe 20 years old. It used to be around 60. All but a few of the trophy-ready elders have assumed their places in living rooms and lodges across the Western world. Observing the hunters, though, you get the impression they think that whole extinction business was all nonsense. As if the elephants were just getting better at hiding.
Having spent a few generations exploiting Africa, without much apparent concern for "community development," the hunters now offer themselves as a free-market solution. Actually, the arrangement more resembles a monopoly, the ivory and hunting industries buying off the locals and agreeing with each other to "leave enough for us!"
 Senator Boxer's proposal on Campfire -- an amendment to an appropriation bill for foreign operations -- is now before the House. She and Senator Wayne Allard of Colorado, the most vocal Republican on the issue, are right to oppose Campfire, but don't stop there. Redouble aid to Africa and see that every dollar goes to building nonhunting industries. Offer every tax incentive in the book for investment in Africa, including a deduction for dollars spent there by unarmed tourists. And ban the importation of any elephant trophy across American borders -- providing violators with fresh attire, trained escort and vehicle transport on their one-year prison adventure, all amenities included.

HEADLINE: Community Colleges At the Crossroads: Which Way Is Up?

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME; Peter Applebome is the national education correspondent for The New York Times.

DATELINE: PHOENIX

 BODY:
There is no stiff academic reserve at the copper-colored office tower in suburban Tempe, Ariz., where Linda Thor is discussing her imperial visions for Rio Salado Community College. The school has no campus and educates 34,000 students in places like churches and shopping malls, and increasingly at home on their computers.
"We were established as a college without walls," Ms. Thor said of the school, which is part of the Maricopa County Community College District, "and today we believe we're a college without boundaries, including geographical boundaries as well as other boundaries, such as the way instruction is delivered, formats and schedules. 
 "Frankly, we see Rio Salado as a global institution, serving not only Maricopa County, but the Southwest, the nation and the world."
The world of Rio Salado and the other Maricopa County community colleges (second in size only to the Los Angeles County system) could not be further from the familiar, ivy-edged stereotypes about higher education. Here there is 110-degree midday heat and a desert landscape. There are little-known campuses, long-in-the-tooth students (averaging 30 years old) and courses that are as likely to train firefighters, police officers and undertakers as scholars, teachers or executives.
But increasingly, in ways legislators in state capitols and in Washington are struggling to make sense of, the higher education mainstream is coming to look a lot more like Rio Salado and Maricopa than like Harvard or Yale.
In fact, the increasing influence of community colleges is putting these institutions at the middle of disputes and turf battles over race, access, budgets, opportunity and educational philosophy that play out in an emerging educational world that is often very different from the one lawmakers and policy makers know best.
Maricopa, for instance, is now the largest provider of higher education in Arizona. It has an almost $600 million annual budget, enrolls more than 200,000 students each year in credit and noncredit courses, employs more than 10,000 people and operates 10 colleges and a skill center offering certificates in career-oriented programs. At about $450 a semester, tuition is just over half that of the four-year state universities.
And in a nation whose students are increasingly older adults, minorities and workers looking to upgrade their skills, community colleges have become an increasingly attractive alternative. The nation's 1,500 community colleges now enroll 10 million students, including more than half the freshmen in higher education, 44 percent of all undergraduates, 45 percent of all the black students in higher education and 52 percent of the Hispanic students.
Nationally, President Clinton perhaps did more for the visibility of community colleges than any other President when he vowed to make a 13th and 14th year of education as common as high school by offering Hope Scholarships, tax credits worth up to $1,500 a year for two years. These would pay the full cost of most community colleges but only a fraction of four-year college tuition.
This changing landscape has led to political disputes over governance, the transferability of junior college credits and more contentious issues:
* New York City's community colleges, particularly Hostos Community College in the Bronx, faced a wrenching debate this spring over language-competency standards, which ended up with hundreds of students, most of whom speak English as a second language, failing an English proficiency test required for graduation. Many feel that the dispute helped fuel efforts to force out the system's chancellor, W. Ann Reynolds, who resigned in mid-July to become president of the University of Alabama, Birmingham.
* In Kentucky, Gov. Paul Patton fought and eventually won a bruising battle to sever the administration of the state's community colleges from the University of Kentucky.
*Florida's budget was delayed because of a bitter fight over community college financing. The argument included debates over the amount of funds, whether the financing should be distributed equally among campuses and whether standards should be established that tie community college financing to performance factors, like the percentage of students who graduate.
* California was one of several states in which the legislature struggled with ways to reconcile welfare reform's mandate to cut off assistance after a designated period with the ability of recipients to finish community college study in time to get a job.
One of the more interesting battles took place in Arizona over a proposal to allow community colleges to offer four-year applied baccalaureate degrees for the first time. The degrees were to be granted in selected areas of professional development like health care, law enforcement and manufacturing technology.
The issues differed from state to state, but they all illustrated the extent to which community colleges have entered the mainstream. It is questionable, however, whether the nation's academic and political leadership are recognizing the increased influence of community colleges and planning for the growing role that they will play.
"The reality now is that we are bearing the load for higher education in the United States in a very significant way," said Paul A. Elsner, Maricopa's chancellor, and one of the leading figures in the community college world. "Look at the transfer numbers. At Arizona State, 65 percent of the upper-division students come from Maricopa Community College. In California, 65 percent of the upper division students at Cal Poly transferred from community colleges. At Rutgers, it's 58 percent. We're a major player, but no one recognizes it at the policy level. We're invariably looked at as the poor cousins or lesser relatives. We're late at the table, often forgotten and most of the time only an afterthought when it comes to policy decisions."
The stories of students at various campuses in the Maricopa district are a dramatic reminder of the changing face of American education.
In 1982, when Jerry Roberts graduated from high school in Phoenix, college seemed neither affordable nor necessary, so he went to work as a concrete finisher. He then spent 11 years at Allied Signal Corporation, where he is now a laboratory technician.
But as Mr. Roberts stared at a computer image of a machine tool he was creating at GateWay Community College here, he reflected on how outdated his former assumptions had become.Now he is back at school nine hours a week, paid for by his employer. He is working on an associate's degree in manufacturing technology and plans to get a bachelor's degree later.
"I couldn't afford college after high school," he said. "But you just need an education today. At my company, it's something they want to see on your resume. I can already see jobs being posted on the board that I can apply for next year."
Other students show how community colleges are serving varied needs. Charity Cook is a 15-year-old high school graduate, schooled at home, who is studying elementary education for the deaf at Phoenix College. Lloyd Foust, 29, who shows up for night classes at Phoenix College in his brown United Parcel Service uniform, wants to be a Southern Baptist minister, but needs to get his bachelor's degree. So he is picking up credits where he can afford them.
Alberta Joe, 18, just graduated from high school and plans to do two years at Phoenix College before transferring to the University of Arizona to study pharmacy.
Jasper Deale, 23, is studying printing at the Maricopa Skill Center under a program administered by the Navajo Department of Employment and Training. The program brought him from the Navajo reservation 700 miles away and pays his rent and tuition in Phoenix. Mr. Deale said that although there was a community college at the reservation (Navajo Community College's Shiprock Branch), it did not have the printing programs he needed. (Story on tribal colleges, Page 28.
"Basically, to get what I needed, I had to go to a big city, Albuquerque or Phoenix," he said. "I was tired of the reservation. There were no jobs or opportunities, but this program was exactly what I needed."
And then there is Dana King-Esquer, a 34-year-old mother of three who graduated from high school in 1979 and got married a year later. She has been working at a high school cafeteria, but got the urge to teach. Attending school full time was out of the question, but in January 1996, she enrolled at Rio Salado.
Rio Salado provides education to 24,000 for-credit students and 10,000 not-for-credit students at 200 sites -- increasingly through distance learning, which includes the use of video and audiotapes, computer disks and the Internet.
Ms. King-Esquer took one course via computer disk on her old Packard-Bell computer, loved it, and has so far taken 55 course credits. This year she won a spot on the All-Arizona second team for academics in a competition supported by the state's community colleges and the national community college honors society. Only 53 of Arizona's 300,000 community college students earned the honor. Ms. King-Esquer hopes to go on to teach second grade.
"I've written essays at 11 at night and at 6 in the morning," she said. "There's no way I could fit a traditional course schedule into my life. But this has worked so well, my daughter, who's a junior in high school, plans to do her first two years of college through distance learning and then transfer to a regular university."
Officials at Maricopa know they still rank well below the state's research universities -- places like the University of Arizona and Arizona State University -- in the traditional academic pecking order. But they are not shy about making the case that as time goes by, what they are offering is what the academic market is increasingly demanding.
"Just like you have just-in-time production, our responsibility is to provide just-in-time education," said Brian Johnson, a 40-year-old New Jersey native who is now dean of Student and Community Services at Mesa Community College, which sprawls across 140 acres of what used to be alfalfa fields and sheep pasture east of Phoenix. Mesa has grown since 1965 from one room in what used to be the Landmark Restaurant in downtown Mesa to the sixth-largest single-site community college in the country, enrolling 23,108 students at the main campus, plus more than a 1,000 other students at four satellite sites.
"Our students need it now," he said. "They need it better, faster and cheaper, and they look to community colleges to deliver it."
It is probably inevitable that community colleges have become bigger players as higher education has gone from a service aimed at society's elite to one that is seen as available to everyone.Indeed, from their beginnings, community colleges have reflected a distinctly American commitment to democratized education.
The first public community college, Joliet Junior College, opened in Illinois in 1901. California, in laws passed in 1907, 1917 and 1921, established the nation's first comprehensive network of community colleges. Other states followed suit with schools designed to be community-based and open to all, and which offered a broad range of academic, professional and technical programs.
But what really changed community colleges was World War II, when a flood of returning veterans looked for education under the G.I. Bill of Rights. The Truman Commission, established by President Harry S. Truman in 1947, proclaimed that the single best way to break down the barriers to higher education was to promote a broad network of publicly supported community colleges. (The term immediately caught on as a replacement for the somewhat dismissive "junior college." The terms are used at both public and private institutions, but "community college" is the much preferred designation.)
The report signaled the first time that community colleges were seen as an integral part of a comprehensive system of higher education. It made the radical claim that 49 percent of the population could benefit from two years of education beyond high school. President Clinton's recent vow to make those two years as common as a high school diploma is a reflection of how much the concept has advanced. Between 1975 and 1992, total community college enrollment grew from 55 percent of the figure for four-year college enrollment to 65 percent.
The Maricopa district illustrates this evolution dramatically.It had its beginnings in 1920, when Phoenix Junior College opened as a department of Phoenix Union High School, with 18 students taking classes in a small one-room cottage on the high school campus. Taxpayers approved a $175,000 bond campaign in 1929 for a new building with 24 classrooms.
The school grew steadily, if quietly, until 1960, when the State Legislature established a community college system. Since then enrollment has exploded, with campuses popping up all over the Phoenix area. The Maricopa district now rivals some state systems, with 10 campuses and one skill center, serving a geographic area larger than the state of Connecticut. About 40 percent of Maricopa County's high school students attend one of the community colleges within a year after graduating, and fall enrollment is expected to grow by 68 percent over the next 10 years.
Besides providing much of the first two years of college training, Maricopa is a huge part of the economic development and job training process in Phoenix. Its Glendale campus is particularly strong in computer and high-technology education. Maricopa now provides specified job training to 25 to 30 companies directly and offers classes in a broad range of skills to at least 70 others. The system is a critical player, for instance, in training high-technology workers for the burgeoning Arizona semiconductor industry.
It has been a long year, said David Baime, director of government relations for the American Association of Community Colleges in Washington.
"Everyone tells me I look like hell," he said.
Actually, it has been a long year for everyone involved in higher education in Washington, as wrangling continues over the Clinton Administration's tax proposals. But it has been especially vexing for Mr. Baime because of the fight over expanding Pell grants for the needy and the efforts to focus tuition and tax assistance on low-income students, often the core constituency of community colleges.
Because they so often deal with the economic needs of low-income and nontraditional students, community colleges sometimes have different priorities from those of the higher education establishment. This can make it difficult for them to sell their programs to legislators more attuned to the agendas of four-year institutions.
"They're only human, and I think it's a constant struggle to get legislators to understand the unique perspective of our institutions," Mr. Baime said. "People identify with what they know best. It's just a fact that the overwhelming majority of members of Congress did not attend a community college and that most of them don't think about sending their children there, though that's less true than in the past."
Such attitudes are common in the states as well.
In Arizona, for instance, most of the legislators have gone to state schools like the University of Arizona and Arizona State, whose prestige and competitive position vis-a-vis other states' flagship campuses inevitably become a source of state pride. There are all sorts of glamorous intangibles, like the University of Arizona winning the N.C.A.A. basketball championship or Arizona State going to the Rose Bowl, that build good will in ways community colleges can never match. And the universities can turn out alumni to lobby for their interests, some of whom may have begun at the community college level but who transferred their loyalty when they transferred their enrollment. Maricopa gets only 14 percent of its budget from the state, compared to the universities' 40 to 45 percent.
The political picture, however, is hardly one-sided. Because they have campuses in legislative districts across the state, community colleges have their allies as well. As the largest provider of job training in Arizona, much of it customized work force training for big employers, Maricopa can and does call on powerful business interests to plead its case.
And as the largest provider of higher education in Arizona, with two full-time lobbyists, Maricopa is not quite David with a slingshot against the Goliaths at Arizona and Arizona State. The district, for instance, had enough political savvy to pass a $386 million bond issue a few years back -- a far cry from the $175,000 issue passed in 1929 and the largest ever passed by a community college district in the United States.
"With them considered the people's colleges, especially in rural areas, they can be a much easier sell than we are," said Blake Anderson, a government relations analyst with Arizona State University. "And Maricopa, in particular, has a huge constituency. I think they're every bit as influential as we are."
Recently, the balance of power was put to the test. Maricopa, like most districts, regularly faces issues related to financing and governance. In Arizona's last legislative session, it was also heavily involved in welfare reform, bidding -- unsuccessfully, as it turned out -- to become a favored provider of education to welfare recipients as they try to get training before their benefits run out. But the biggest education issue, and one that pitted the four-year colleges against the community colleges in a way that was unusually stark, was the fight over the proposal to begin four-year applied baccalaureate programs in selected occupational areas at community colleges.
At least two states, New York and Utah, offer such degrees in limited areas. And community college advocates argue that they are merely proposing degrees in selected applied areas, like the training of fire fighters, police officers, manufacturing specialists or surgical nurses, which are not now covered by four-year institutions. For instance, they say the kind of manufacturing technology training Mr. Roberts is getting at GateWay could be delivered by the community college system more cheaply and efficiently than by four-year institutions.
"We don't aspire to be a university; we like who we are," said Ms. Thor, who began her career in higher education as a public information officer for the Pepperdine University School of Continuing Education in Malibu, Calif., and later earned a master's degree in public administration from California State University, Los Angeles, and a doctorate in community college administration from Pepperdine University. "What we aspire to is to fully meet the needs of our students in the areas in which we are expert," she said. "That's what matters, not some outmoded view that what we do always has to fit into two years. The reality is that there are many programs that take more than two years now."
Rather than a need unfilled, the universities saw a grab for turf and power and turned out a full-court press against the proposal that saw the presidents of all three public universities in Arizona -- the University of Arizona, Arizona State and Northern Arizona University -- personally lobbying legislators.
Allan Price, vice president for institutional advancement at Arizona State, said he was not convinced that there was a demonstrated need in any of the areas in which the community colleges were contemplating four-year programs, and said that the proposal represented a threat to the carefully delineated system in place now.
"This is a solution looking for a problem," he said. "Right now we have a system that's very coherent. We need to be very careful about blurring the lines that work well now."
In the end, the proposal narrowly passed and then was vetoed by Gov. Fyfe Symington. Two study groups have been convened to examine the issue further, and it is likely to reemerge next fall.
To many people both inside and outside the community college system here, the issue in Arizona is a precursor to a much broader look at what kind of role community colleges should play at a time the public is demanding cheaper, more relevant, more efficient education, and when cost pressures are making it impossible for universities to build enough buildings and hire enough professors to meet anticipated needs.
"I think the recognition is building, but it will take a long time," said David Pierce, president of the American Association of Community Colleges, in Washington. "Right now the public is very positive toward community colleges. Our job is to work hard to keep building an identity and a message."
Among issues that need to be addressed, Mr. Elsner, the Maricopa chancellor, cited a more equitable share of Federal science financing and international development grants, as well as making financial aid more responsive to the needs of nontraditional students.
Regardless of what happens with the four-year proposal, he said there will inevitably be more collisions, not just between two- and four-year institutions, but between traditional institutions and emerging for-profit ones which are now operating in states around the country, like the entrepreneurial University of Phoenix.
Experts say these confrontations are all part of the change slowly transforming higher education here and elsewhere. This change, Ms. Thor said, may blur the neat lines between two-year and four-year institutions, but that is not necessarily bad.
"If you look at other industries -- utilities, telecommunications, health care -- the lines used to be neat and well defined, and then the market changed completely," she said. "They were restructured into very different industries with a lot more competition. I think we're the next health care."

NEW FEDERALIST PAPERS
 Essays in Defense of the Constitution.
 By Alan Brinkley, Nelson W. Polsby
 and Kathleen M. Sullivan.
 179 pp. New York: A 20th Century Fund Book/
 W. W. Norton & Company. $23. 
 The men who assembled at the Constitutional Convention of 1787 had a daunting goal: to create a new Federal Government that would knit together jealously independent states. They had to be optimists, but they would surely be astonished at the success of their creation.
How ungrateful we are today for the miracle of their governmental structure. We live in a time of political discontent that goes even to our basic institutions. Radicals in Congress, calling themselves conservative, press for major surgery on the Constitution. Some demand an end to the judicial independence that has assured our freedom. The very idea of the Federal Government is treated with contempt.
This contemporary assault on our system led the 20th Century Fund to commission "New Federalist Papers," essays in defense of the Constitution by Alan Brinkley, Nelson W. Polsby and Kathleen M. Sullivan, respectively professors of history at Columbia University, political science at the University of California, Berkeley, and law at Stanford. As the title of the collection indicates, the authors go back to first principles -- to the arguments made in the Federalist Papers to save the Constitution from defeat in the state ratifying conventions to which it was submitted.
We are mostly unaware now what a close thing ratification was. Americans had just carried out a revolution against the centralized power of an English king. Many feared that the proposed new Federal Government would bring tyranny again.
Defenders of the Constitution responded to that fear with what Bernard Bailyn of Harvard has called "one of the great surges of creative political thought in Western history," most of all in the articles that constitute the Federalist Papers. This collection, by James Madison, Alexander Hamilton and John Jay, was produced mainly for newspaper publication, at the astounding average rate of 1,000 words a day for over six months. Yet it is rightly compared to the work of the greatest political philosophers.
The Federalist Papers' answer to the fear of power was that safety lay, as Madison put it, in "the extent and proper structure" of the proposed Federal Government. The very size and diversity of its constituent states and populations would make it safer than smaller, more homogeneous polities because "the greater variety of parties and interests" would prevent a passing political passion from overwhelming the system. A second defense against political extremism was that the constitutional system was not a direct democracy, with all the dangers of popular emotionalism, but a republic -- in which the people's views would be filtered through elected representatives.
But it was the governmental structure, the most ingenious of the Framers' creations, on which the Federalist Papers most heavily relied as assurance against abuse of power. Authority was divided between the states and the national Government. And within the latter there was the separation of powers among the three branches -- executive, legislative, judicial -- each on guard against overreaching by the others.
The wisdom of the Framers has been proved so often over 200 years that it should not be necessary to examine their views again. But it is necessary, as "New Federalist Papers" makes plain. For those who are attacking the constitutional system now make some of the same arguments that were made against the Constitution at the beginning -- in corrupted form.
Thus we are told that the Federal Government is inherently evil, that its functions should be turned over to the states. But for the reasons that Madison and his colleagues saw, it would be exactly wrong -- unsafe -- to leave Americans to the mercies of the separate states. Moreover, the cry for "states' rights" is hypocritical, in fact masking a desire to advance particular interests. The same people who denounce Federal power have federalized ordinary criminal law to an extent that would have appalled the Framers, and demand that tort law -- always a province of the states -- be federalized to protect corporate defendants from large judgments.
Brinkley explains how we have lost what was the premise of 1787: the belief that government can work. Fewer and fewer citizens perform their essential duty -- voting. Most see politics on a television screen, and regard it as a closed world "in which nothing is real and nothing is true."
Public contempt for government, he says, produces a vicious circle that makes government worse. Suspicion of scandal immobilizes bureaucracies. Official discretion is feared, so that we surround every potential decision with conditions that prevent action.
Sullivan examines the current attempts to impose social or economic policies by amending the Constitution. We tried that once before, she notes, with the Prohibition amendment: not a happy precedent. If we had had a balanced budget amendment in force for the last 50 years, she says, "the nation's economic health would be a great deal weaker now."
POLSBY asks Americans, movingly, to think about how well we have done in governing a continental nation: "If one accepts the premise that tribalism is a human universal, then the incarceration of Japanese-Americans in World War II, the exclusion of Jews from universities and the professions in the 1920's and 1930's, the ruthless persecution of Mormons, the removal of Indian tribes and the maintenance of a brutal, racial caste system in the pre-1960's South seem less remarkable than the eventual alleviation, reversal or abandonment of all these social policies by the American political system."
It is not possible to give more than a few examples of the themes in "New Federalist Papers." Some of it examines particular issues of only passing interest. But there is much here that goes to the roots of our political system and its present illness.
The authors do not offer easy remedies, and I do not suppose there are any. But the more Americans read and understand this wise book, the healthier our political society will be. We might become less cynical about politics. We might be less susceptible to political quackery about the evil of the United States Government.

HEADLINE: WHAT'S DOING IN;
Chicago

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON; DIRK JOHNSON is a correspondent in the Chicago bureau of The Times.

 BODY:
This Midwestern behemoth is a city that seems eternally at work: building, shaping, dealing. But in summer, Chicago is at play: Sunbathers on Oak Street Beach and sailboats on Lake Michigan, baseball at Wrigley Field and iced tea at Rush Street outdoor cafes. Chicago these days seems one long celebration, a time for survivors of the famously brutal winters to cherish the loveliness, and liberation, of summertime in the city.
The mood of this traditionally blunt, no-nonsense capital of Middle America is positively giddy at the moment. Crime has fallen. The economy is booming. New town houses and shops are transforming old neighborhoods. Growing numbers of suburbanites have been returning to shop and play, and even to live. 
 Late last month, road repairs were slowing traffic on Michigan Avenue from the Chicago River to Randolph Avenue; visitors may face delays.
 
Events
 The Chicago Jazz Festival, a celebration from Aug. 28 to 31 in Grant Park alongside Lake Michigan, will feature Betty Carter, the bebop singer, as well as Clarence (Gatemouth) Brown and his Big Band and the Joe Henderson Quartet, among many others. Seats go fast, so take a chair or a blanket to spread on the grass. Performances are Aug. 28, 6 to 10 P.M.; Aug. 29, 5 to 10 P.M., and Aug. 30 and 31, noon to 10 P.M. Information: (312) 744-3370. Admission is free.
One of the top acts (literally) at the Chicago Air and Water Show, an exhibition of daring over Lake Michigan Aug. 23 and 24, will be the United States Air Force Thunderbirds, precision-formation fighter pilots commanding F-16 Fighting Falcons. The beaches at Oak Street or North Avenue are good places to watch. Information: (312) 744-3370. Exhibitions by trick water-skiers start at 9 A.M. The air show begins at 11 A.M., with the Thunderbirds performing at 3 P.M. Admission is free.
The Gold Coast Art Fair on Friday, Saturday and Sunday on the sidewalks just northwest of downtown features the works of about 300 artists, mostly paintings and sculpture. The fair is centered on the intersection of Erie and Wells, in the city's River North area. Hours are 10 A.M. to 8 P.M.; admission is free. Information: (312) 787-2677.
The Chicago Symphony Orchestra is presenting a series of open-air performances next weekend at Ravinia, (847) 266-5100, in suburban Highland Park, about 25 miles north of the city. Performances start at 8 P.M. on Friday and Saturday and 7 P.M. on Sunday. A Metra "Ravinia Park Special" train leaves Madison and Canal Streets at 5:50 and arrives at Ravinia's gate at 6:30 P.M. ($4 round trip). The orchestra will present works by Beethoven, Schubert, Brahms and Verdi and Mahler, among others. Other performers at Ravinia include the flutist James Galway with the Ravinia Festival Orchestra on Aug. 14; Willie Nelson on Aug. 22 and the Joffrey Ballet of Chicago on Aug. 27 to 30 (all at 8 P.M.). Tickets, $8 to $40.
The Steppenwolf Theater Company, with its reputation for visceral, highly charged works, and alumni that include John Malkovich, Joan Allen and Gary Sinise, will present "A Fair Country," by Jon Robin Baitz, about a family in South Africa, through Aug. 24. Performances are at the Steppenwolf Theater, 1650 North Halsted Street, (312) 335-1650. Tickets, $24.50 to $36.50.
A collection of sculpture from India, the Himalayas and Southeast Asia will be displayed at the Art Institute of Chicago, 111 South Michigan Avenue, (312) 443-3600, through Oct. 26. The sculptures are chiseled from sandstone as well as delicately crafted in bronze, copper, silver and gold. They include images of the gods Shiva and Vishnu and an elegant seated Indra (the Vedic god of the heavens who hurls thunderbolts). They are on loan from the collection of Chicagoans Marilynn Alsdorf and her late husband, James. The museum has one of the world's largest collections of Impressionist art, among other treasures. Suggested admission $7; free on Tuesday. Open Monday to Friday 10:30 A.M. to 4:30 P.M., and until 8 P.M. on Tuesday; 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. Saturday, noon to 5 Sunday.
 
Sightseeing
 The best place for shopping and people-watching is along North Michigan Avenue, a stretch that includes the grand old limestone Water Tower, the only major building downtown to escape the Chicago Fire of 1871. A mile or so to the south, noisy El trains circle the famous Loop, still a bustling commercial district, a place where ordinary Chicagoans tend to do their shopping, rather than on the expensive North Michigan Avenue. Just west of the El tracks is the nation's tallest building, the 110-story Sears Tower, 233 South Wacker Drive. An observation deck on the 103d floor, (312) 875-9696, is open daily, 9 A.M. to 11 P.M. Admission is $6.75. The entrance is on Jackson Boulevard between Wacker Drive and Franklin Street.
The Chicago Architecture Foundation, (312) 922-3432, offers excellent architecture tours, by foot, bus, bike or riverboat, for $10 to $25. Sites include the Frank Lloyd Wright home at 951 Chicago Avenue in the suburb of Oak Park; the dramatic Wrigley Building at the river bridge on Michigan Avenue, and the Carson Pirie Scott Department Store at State and Madison Streets.
Anyone who wants his 15 minutes of fame recorded on videotape should head for the Museum of Broadcast Communications, in the Chicago Cultural Center at the corner of Michigan Avenue and Washington Street, (312) 629-6000. Along with displaying an authentic Charlie McCarthy used by Edgar Bergen and an example of the first swiveling television set, the museum allows visitors to slip on a jacket and a clip-on microphone, then settle into the anchor's chair and read news from a teleprompter.

Where to Eat
 Charlie Trotter's, 816 West Armitage Avenue, (773) 248-6228, specializes in a modern American cuisine influenced by Asian minimalism. The chef is known for the artistic presentation of his dishes. Diners generally order the tasting menu, sampling six to eight courses, for $90. There are three intimate dining rooms in the two-story, turn-of-the-century brownstone building.

HEADLINE: COLLEGE & MONEY;
Balancing the Babies and the Books

BYLINE: By HALIMAH ABDULLAH; Halimah Abdullah is a senior at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa.

 BODY:
Two years ago, Marie Gardner was on welfare, a single mother of two who put her children in a cart attached to a bicycle and pedaled 10 miles a day to and from her classes at South Suburban College in South Holland, a Chicago suburb. Today she has a nursing degree, a car and a job at Ingalls Memorial Hospital in nearby Harvey, Ill.
 Ms. Gardner credits the day care center at South Suburban, a community college, for providing her and her children with the financial and moral support they needed. 
 "I couldn't have made it through school and off welfare without the help," she said.
 Increasingly, today's college students are, like Ms. Gardner, single parents struggling to balance course work, financial hardships and their children's needs. For many, the ability to find adequate, affordable child care can make the difference between remaining in school or dropping out, said Denise Fogarty, program director for Child Care Aware, a nonprofit organization based in Rochester, Minn., that helps parents contact child care referral services.
 "There is a trend that more colleges and universities are becoming aware of the needs of parents with small children," she said. "They are discovering what they believe is a solution -- on-site child care."
 According to the American Council on Education, in Washington, by the year 2005, there will be roughly 6.5 million students aged 25 and older enrolled in the nation's colleges and universities. Taking a cue from big business, administrators are finding that one of the best ways to serve these students is with on-campus child care, said Todd Boressoff, advocacy chairman for the National Coalition for Campus Children's Centers, in Cascade, Wis. Nationwide, roughly 1,700 campuses are offering on-campus child care, he said.
 The schools are as varied as the services. From four-year Ivy League institutions like Cornell University and the University of Pennsylvania to state universities and two-year community colleges, schools are discovering that offering child care saves thousands of dollars in tuition and other fees that are lost when overburdened students drop out to care for children.
 Even those who stay in school sometimes bring their children to class. "That was definitely a problem for us," said Gale Stevens Haynes, provost of the Brooklyn campus of Long Island University, which now offers on-site child care. "We knew that it was not a good environment for any of the people involved. But whenever a student you recruit leaves, it costs the university."
 Students who drop out, especially those on public assistance, cost not only the college or university, but also society, said Jose Regalado, assistant dean of job training at South Suburban College. The college's five-year-old Opportunities program, which helped Ms. Gardner, is designed to provide low-income students with day care services.
 "The whole idea of work force preparation is that you can't have economic development without a trained work force," he said.
 Although schools' participation in on-site day care is new, student advocacy for obtaining these services is not.
 In 1970, a group of graduate students at Cornell University helped pioneer the on-site day care movement by forming a parent cooperative to help take care of one another's children. Now, the University Cooperative Nursery School serves the children of about 50 student, faculty and staff members, said Sally Reimer, the school's part-time director.
 Parents can choose from two-, three- and five-day enrollment options, and they pay on a sliding scale, based on income. Although not officially connected with Cornell, the nursery school is allowed free use of campus space.
 "In addition, Cornell issues the teachers' checks," Ms. Reimer said, "so that they are eligible for campus employee benefits."
 The Penn Children's Center at the University of Pennsylvania, which cares for 73 children, is also an offshoot, said Angali Chawla, the center's director. Originally managed by the university's School of Social Work, the center is now a separate entity, supported by the university and parents' tuition payments. These range from $140 to $210, based on the age of the child.
 While services like these can often rely on private and student contributions, schools with more indigent parents face greater difficulties. Currently, the Federal Government provides colleges with a child care allowance for student parents on public assistance. The amount varies, based on the number of students receiving welfare. Some institutions combine this financing with state funds. Some needy students also use money from Federal Pell grants to help pay their child care costs.
 Sometimes universities and colleges must create a veritable financial gumbo to provide the child care services that best serve their students, said Charlene Kohler-Britton, director of Brooklyn College Child Care Services Inc. Her program currently serves 35 children of students attending Brooklyn College, a branch of the City University of New York.
 "What the students get out of it is a nearby place to put their kids," she said. "What the school gets out of it is the ability to pay teachers with Federal money."
More than 20 of the students using the college's day care are on public assistance; they net almost $67,000 in Federal aid for the program. Program administrators use this amount, along with state funds, to pay for five teachers' and assistants' salaries and supplies. Students pay anywhere from $1 to $48 a week, based on their incomes, Ms. Kohler-Britton said.
 Zephie Powell, an adjunct professor of English and a graduate student at Brooklyn College, is confined to a wheelchair, the result of third-degree burns she suffered as a child. The 33-year-old mother of two daughters, she found her child care options limited when she returned to school for a master's in education.
 "I would go to school until 10 or 11 o'clock at night," she said. "A lot of times, I had to bring the baby to class."
 After a professor pointed Mrs. Powell in the direction of the program, she quickly enrolled.
 "What makes it easy for me is that everything is in one place," Mrs. Powell said, "where I go to school, where my child goes to school, where I work and where I study."
 Convenience is an increasingly important factor for the older college population, said Ms. Stevens Haynes. Long Island University's student body, which is 68 percent female, virtually demanded that the school address this issue, she said.
 The university responded last fall by contracting Corporate Child Care Services, a for-profit day care business, to serve the 100 children of students who need such care. The service costs $400,000 a year, a great deal less than the estimated $2 million it would have cost the university to build and staff its own day care center, Ms. Stevens Haynes said.
 Legislative trends toward cutting welfare rolls have also made child care a much more urgent need, said Alistair MacKinnon, coordinator of Federal education legislation for the New York State Department of Education.
 Carlow College, a four-year liberal arts institution in Pittsburgh's inner city, allocates $300,000 annually to provide child care, said Sister Mary Paul Hickey, executive director of the college's Children's Center.
 "We were seeing increasingly young parents coming back to school to get their degrees," she said.
 Nearly a fourth of the college's 22,000 students uses the school's two child care centers, one of which is located in the Bedford Dwellings housing project.
 While most students in the Opportunities program at South Suburban College receive both Federal financial aid and welfare assistance, it is not enough to cover the additional cost of child care, Mr. Regalado said. The program provides day care services and, in some cases, an additional $300 annual stipend.
 "Welfare parents find themselves taking care of kids and living off the Government," he said. "The best thing to do is to help them find child care, train them and get them in the work force."
 
Ways to Get Help With Your Children on Campus
 
Todd Boressoff, advocacy chairman for the National Coalition for Campus Children's Centers, in Cascade, Wis., suggests the following strategies for students seeking child care:
-- When considering a college or university, ask the admissions officers about campus-based child care. Some schools have on-site centers, while others contract out to corporate services.
-- If a school has on-site day care, look into it as soon as you are accepted. Most centers have a limited capacity and long waiting lists.
-- If a school does not have on-site day care, investigate the nearest child care resource and referral agency. Such services can often help find affordable providers.
-- If dealing with day care centers, check on their schedules. Not all offer early-morning and extended hours.
-- Look into financial aid. In most cases, student aid can be used to pay for child care services, but only after primary educational expenses have been met. When considering these sources, consult a financial aid counselor.

HEADLINE: Teaching on the Front Lines

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON; Karen W. Arenson covers higher education for The New York Times.

DATELINE: MANASSAS, Va.

 BODY:
Life as a community college professor sometimes turns Sheri David churlish. At a barbecue this summer, she snapped at a professor from a prestigious four-year college who was complaining about being forced to teach three classes in the coming term. She usually teaches five.
 And in a van to the airport after a history conference in Chicago last year, she turned to a professor in the seat behind her and told him "to shut up" after listening to him whine about how his college paid for only two nights of travel, rather than the typical three. Her college allots her $50; she pays the rest. 
 Like many community college professors across America, Professor David, who teaches history at Northern Virginia Community College, in Manassas, has seen her career turn out far differently from what she had envisioned.
 As a student at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, she studied under Arthur Schlesinger Jr., the noted historian, and hoped to emulate his career as a researcher and writer. During graduate school, she taught at Essex County College in Newark, Lehman College in the Bronx and Caldwell College in New Jersey. After graduate school, there were jobs at Hofstra University on Long Island, and then, after she divorced and moved south for personal reasons, at George Mason University in Virginia. Eight years ago, she came to Northern Virginia Community College because it offered her a permanent, full-time position. Here she finds little time to do research or write.
 "When I took this job at the community college, I knew I was destroying my career," said Professor David.
 But Professor David, who is 48, is not as unhappy as she sounds.
 Like many of the 200,000 full-time community college professors in America, she loves what she is doing and is convinced that it is important. She has forged a career as a college professor, even as many of her fellow graduate students failed to find jobs in academia. She is passionate about teaching and relishes even her basic courses, like American History I and II. And even though she spends most of her time teaching basic history, she does not have to spend time teaching other basics. Although many community colleges struggle with students who know little English or who are not ready to do college work, these are not big problems for Manassas and the four other Northern Virginia Community College campuses. The college draws many of its 60,000 students from the middle- and upper-middle-class communities around it. In fact, more than 500 of its students already have Ph.D.'s, and many are there for training that will help them enter new fields, like computing.
 Professor David sees community colleges as the front lines of higher education in a nation that has placed a bigger and bigger premium on getting a college degree.
 "I'm now one of these totally committed community college people," she said. "When I go to the two main history conferences, people ask me whether I am looking to leave," she added. "I say, 'No, why would I?' I really enjoy it."
 In addition, history courses are staples for many community college students, because the credits are generally transferable to four-year colleges.
 "Half of all college students taking history are getting their history from community colleges," Professor David said. "So I feel good about my role."
 She even loves speaking to community groups -- one of the forms of community service that her college expects of its faculty, although it does not pay them extra.
 But there are drawbacks to working at a community college, she concedes, conditions that sometimes make her feel as if she and her colleagues "are doing our jobs with one hand tied behind our backs."
 The biggest is pay.
 Teaching loads at community colleges are higher than those at four-year colleges, but salaries are generally lower. With state budget cuts, Northern Virginia's pay scales have slipped among community colleges. As a single mother supporting two sons in college, Professor David finds her $44,000 salary doesn't stretch very far.
 Another disadvantage is the limited support for career development.
 Although Northern Virginia has some programs to foster faculty development (like encouraging them to use their classrooms for research that they can publish in journals), the college does not offer much time for research or paid sabbaticals. When Professor David won a Fulbright-Hays fellowship to teach in Belarus four years ago, Northern Virginia had to make special arrangements to pay part of her salary so that she could take the position.
 Working conditions are also spartan, even in Professor David's building, which was constructed last year. As she ushered a visitor into her office -- a faculty cubicle separated from others by dividers -- it was hard to ignore the English professor next door quizzing a student about why he missed the first two classes in the term. And while the college hopes to give each faculty member a computer before the end of the summer, for now, groups of professors must share machines.
 All this was forgotten, however, as Professor David headed for her 6:30 class in American History on a hot Monday evening in early July. Nearly 30 students, most in their teens or early 20's, were crammed into a small classroom, waiting patiently for the professor.
 College professors often try to avoid teaching in the summer. For Professor David, however, it is an economic necessity. But she also views the summer session as "fun," because half of the students are from other colleges, and many dislike history.
 "It is a personal challenge to turn them around," she said.
 In the classroom, she quickly took attendance, and then moved briskly into a whirlwind tour of American politics in the early 1900's: Teddy Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, the Panama Canal, muckraking -- all in a couple of hours.
 Much of the class was a straightforward lecture. Professor David, wearing comfortable shoes and a silky shirtdress, alternated between standing behind a lectern and sitting on the front edge of her desk. She knew her material and was an engaging speaker.
 She squeezed in points about how history is chronicled and information gathered. She played a brief tape of Pete Seeger singing about coal miners, for example, and asked the class what information they could glean from the song. "Sometimes we can see history or hear history," she said.
 Professor David also related her lesson to current events, suggesting, for example, that the strong modern American presidency has its roots in the early days of the century. Teddy Roosevelt, she told her students, sent the Navy halfway around the world and then dared Congress to get it back.
 Although it was the end of the day, and many students had come to class from full-time jobs, most were attentive.
 "I hate history," said Brian Paget, a 20-year-old student from James Madison University, who is trying to squeeze enough courses for a triple major into five years, "but I need general education credits and I am finding this interesting." Northern Virginia allows him to take summer courses cheaply. He added: "She really brings a lot of visual images into it. She uses techniques I've read about. My last teacher was so bad, I didn't go to class."
 After the class break, Professor David raced through a variety of social issues -- child labor, worker safety, prohibition, racism, women's suffrage, birth control. "You get the idea," she said. "There was a lot of stuff going on.
 "We've swept through the entire progressive movement," she said at the end of the class. Then she added suggestively, "You can take an entire course of this."
 She does not teach such a class herself. But she does give one on Vietnam, a course on policy issues surrounding the American experience there, which she says she would probably not be allowed to teach at a university because she has not published in the field.
 Teaching the course in Northern Virginia has been especially interesting, she said, because of the diverse mix of students: veterans, children of veterans, current military officials and lately, more and more nearby residents of Vietnamese descent.
 Sometimes the conversation gets heated, and she has to put a lid on the discussion.
 "I remind the students that where they were and when they were there very much defines their experience," she said. "It doesn't substitute for the whole picture."
 What she likes best, she added, is that "I never know what to expect."
 One student, a military officer, took Vietnamese history at three different colleges to see how it was being taught. He was particularly worried about her course, she said, because it was being taught by a woman, but he sat through the semester.
 "He said it was fine," she recalled with a satisfied smile. "That was his highest compliment."

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES; Steven A. Holmes covers race relations and demographics for The New York Times.

DATELINE: CROW AGENCY, Mont.

 BODY:
Two years ago, Danetta Jane Holds, a Crow Indian, tried to help her 15-year-old son with his algebra homework and discovered to her horror that she couldn't do it. This abrupt affirmation of her educational shortcomings convinced Ms. Holds, who never went beyond high school, that it was time to finally get a college degree.
 Daunted by the prospect of traveling 65 miles to the nearest four-year college in Billings and what she saw as an alien and not very friendly white world, Ms. Holds enrolled at Little Big Horn College, a two-year community college on the sprawling Crow Reservation in south central Montana. 
 "There are no strangers here," she said. "I got married when I was pretty young, so I've never actually been any place else. So it's kind of scary to go other places. I'd rather stay here. This is my sanctuary, the Crow reservation."
 Ms. Holds's reasoning is shared by thousands of Indian students and helps to explain the explosive growth in recent decades of tribal colleges, which are chartered by their tribes and based on remote reservations primarily in the West, where most Indians live.
 Many of the tribal colleges were founded because a number of Indian educators became concerned about the high dropout rates for Indian college students. Studies in the 1970's indicated that about 70 percent of Indian students quit college before graduating from traditional four-year schools, and at many institutions, the dropout rate was more than 90 percent.
 Indian leaders blame racism, a lack of sensitivity among authorities at mainstream colleges and the poor preparation of many Indian students who attend high school on reservations. But they acknowledge that cultural considerations play a part, especially for some close-knit tribes like the Crow. Many educators involved in the founding of tribal colleges believed that the answer was a system of colleges on the reservations that would grant degrees or ease the transition from reservation life to mainstream schools.
 Since 1968, when the Navajo tribe established Navajo Community College in Tsaile, Ariz., the number of colleges chartered by Indian tribes and run by Indian administrators has increased to 27. The number of full- and part-time students attending these colleges and three others run directly by the Federal Government has more than doubled since 1989, to about 25,000 from 10,000.
 Tribal colleges are now among the bright spots on Indian reservations, which, despite the emergence of casino gambling, remain some of the poorest areas in the United States, with an overall unemployment rate of 49 percent.
 In a May report, the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching said that tribal colleges had "taken on a breathtaking array of responsibilities" and that with each passing year, they "prove their worth to Indian communities and the nation."
 Yet tribal colleges are struggling financially. Unlike other community colleges in the country, they receive no funding from state and local governments, which view the colleges as Federal entities, because they are usually on Indian reservations. And because they have to keep their tuitions low, student fees cannot be counted on to finance the colleges. Legislation passed in 1978 authorizes a lump sum payment of Federal aid that translates to about $5,820 per Indian student. But Congress has never actually given the colleges that much money. Federal aid has also not kept pace with the growth in enrollment and is currently about $2,900 per student.
 "That's our number-one problem and our number-one challenge," said Gerald (Carty) Monette, president of Turtle Mountain Community College in Belcourt, N.D., which is associated with the Chippewa tribe. "Our funding is disastrous."
 Some college officials believe the financial situation is about to get worse. In addition to granting associate's degrees, the colleges offer remedial courses and general equivalency diplomas.
 In coming years, administrators fear that their campuses will be swamped by untrained and out-of-work Indians who have been forced off the welfare rolls by recent Federal legislation.
 "Many individuals are not employable," Mr. Monette said. "Most don't have skills to go out to find a job and keep it. But they have to do something, and most will go to places like the tribal colleges."
 The financial fragility -- and resourcefulness -- of many tribal colleges can be seen at Little Big Horn. A tiny school of about 200 students, Little Big Horn is tucked away on the 2.2-million-acre Crow Reservation. The campus consists of a few trailers and a former gymnasium given to the college by the tribal government.
 The buildings have been expanded and renovated by carpentry and building trades students as their academic projects. Strapped for cash, administrators are paying the salaries of 4 of the school's 18 instructors through one- or two-year grants from private foundations until the school is sure there is enough student interest in these teachers' courses to pay them directly from the college's budget.
 School officials say this practice allows them to expand the number of courses without committing large sums of money up front. But they fret about possibly losing some faculty since they cannot promise to pay them after one or two years.
 "It's a very risky strategy, and it's a strategy that most colleges would never use," said Janine Pease Pretty On Top, president of Little Big Horn. "It's a very eyes-open way to try to build up our capacity. But it is a risk."
 Little Big Horn improvises in other ways. For example, through grants it has created an impressive computer network. More than 100 computer work stations -- about one for every two students -- are scattered throughout the college. And, as faculty like to point out, the computers are not under-powered hand-me-downs discarded by local businesses, but modern work stations loaded with sophisticated software. All of the computers on campus have Internet access and each student has an E-mail address.
 "People see we're a little tribal college in the back of Crow Agency and think they're going to see DOS computers and maybe a few scattered work stations," said Randy Falls Down, head of the computer science department. "But they're real surprised."
 The tribe, whose name in its own language is Apsaalooka or "children of the long-beaked bird," which was incorrectly translated by early white settlers as "crow," is a tight-knit group for whom maintenance of culture is important. About 75 percent of the approximately 7,000 tribe members live on or near the reservations, and about 85 percent speak the Crow language, a far higher proportion of native language speakers than any other tribe in the country, except the Navajo.
 Obligations to extended family are also critically important. "My seventh cousin is the same as my first cousin," said Jennifer Flatlip, head of the Crow Studies Department at Little Big Horn.
 As a result, members of the tribe are reluctant to leave the reservation and tend not to do well when they go to school elsewhere.
 "We don't think there is much out there that is worthwhile," said Ms. Pretty on Top.
 Given the remoteness of the reservation and the reluctance of tribal members to leave, Ms. Pretty on Top, like a number of other heads of tribal colleges, is trying to structure the school's curriculum to help the reservation's economic development.
 "We don't have nine randomly picked associate of arts degrees," she said. "We've chosen specific fields so that people can be working here. We're building this community, not any other community, so we're not a generic community college in that regard."
 Little Big Horn established its computer science program after surveys of businesses in nearby towns like Hardin, Mont., and Sheridan, Wyo., revealed a need for computer-literate workers. The college is also trying to build a strong program in natural science, a field that can lead to careers in land management and animal husbandry. The goal is to help train a cadre of Crow who can manage the reservation's buffalo and elk herd, its stock of trout and its oil, gas, coal and timber reserves.
 "I want to clean up the area," said Trisha Bird Bear, 19, a first-year student who wants to major in environmental science and natural resources and become an environmental lawyer.
 Ms. Bird Bear is the third in her family to attend college, but her older brother and sister, who went to school away from the reservation, both dropped out and returned home. Yet when asked if she was going to make it all the way through Little Big Horn, as well as through a four-year college and then law school, she answered matter of factly, "Of course."
 In some smaller ways, the college is trying to accomplish more immediate economic development.
 Little Big Horn, like a number of tribal colleges, tries to help nurture small businesses on the reservation and trains members of the tribe to be guides to fishermen angling for trout on the Big Horn River.
 In recent years the college began offering courses to train tour guides for the Little Big Horn Battlefield, which is about two miles away. Through its Institute for Micro-Business and Tourism, the school helped start Apsaalooka Tours, which this year won a concession to provide guided tours of the battlefield where George Armstrong Custer and the members of the Seventh Calvary were defeated by Sioux and Cheyenne warriors.
 Beyond the economic boost, the college also serves other purposes for the Crow. It is a community center where groups can hold meetings. Members of the tribe and other Indians can all use its library, which is linked electronically to five other regional libraries. . And the school strives to help insure the tribe's cultural heritage, requiring, for example, that all students, including non-Indians, take at least one semester of the Crow language.
 To some Crow, the college is also a symbol of nationhood, a reminder that their reservation is not merely a sprawling ghetto, but a sovereign entity deserving its own institutions.
 "We're like a national university," said Ms. Pretty On Top. "Like those national universities in Latin America. We exist for the preservation and the protection and, you might even say, the defense of the country. We're not just a neighborhood literacy center."
 In early June, in a stand of tall cottonwood trees, about two miles from the historic battlefield, 18 Indian students -- 1 Navajo and 17 Crow, including Denetta Holds -- strode onto a makeshift stage and received their associate of arts degrees.
 In the audience was Ken Dawes, 32, a 1995 graduate of Little Big Horn, who in May received his bachelor's degree from Montana State University in Billings. Mr. Dawes had dropped out of high school when he was 16 and didn't get his GED until 1988. Now he is hoping to get a master's degree in museum science and to do research on the Crow tribe.
His inspiration, he said, came from a former Crow chief.
 "It's like Chief Plenty Coups said," he explained. "With an education, you're the white man's equal. Without an education, you're his victim."

HEADLINE: Behind Botanical Garden's Renovation

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER 

 BODY:
WHEN the New York Botanical Garden's spectacular glasshouse, the Enid A. Haupt Conservatory, reopened in May after a four-year, $25 million restoration, which returned the century-old building to its former splendor, nobody was happier than Amy E. Cohn.
For Ms. Cohn, director of capital projects at the Botanical Garden in the Bronx, it was a day of mixed emotions. 
 "I felt enormous relief, followed by great pride on behalf of all those people in every department of the garden who worked on the project," Ms. Cohn said. "They did a tremendous job."
As for Ms. Cohn, 51, who became the garden's first capital projects manager in 1989, the four years spent on the conservatory project not only transformed the building but also her job.
"When I first took the job, I was the entire Capital Projects Department," she said. "Four years later, we grew into a 12-member staff, with an in-house construction management team, project managers, administrators and support staff."
Ms. Cohn, who holds a Ph.D. in Fine Arts from Boston Univesity, wrote her dissertation on the post-war architecture of convention hotels. She also has master's . degrees in art history and finance. Her work experiences, she said, can be accurately classified as eclectic.
"Basically, the position I have today evolved through explorations," she said. "While I was at school I had a job with the Cambridge Historical Commission in Cambridge, Mass. I worked on preservation, which was a relatively new concept in 1970. I administered historic district cases and issues, discovering that I was good at administrative work, which I liked."
When she was ready to enter the work force full time, Ms. Cohn sent her resume to a dozen or more hotels.
"Why hotels? In writing my dissertation, I learned a lot about them," she said. "And I figured anyone with a Ph.D. who wanted to work in that relatively low-paying industry would at least get an interview.
"The only one interested was the executive vice president of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in Manhattan. He asked me to come for an interview, and the upshot was that he offered me a sales job, which I declined. He later came up with the position of rehabilitation manager, which started out more like interior decorating."
But interior decorating quickly turned into renovation, and Ms. Cohn was assigned to the building superintendent.
"I knew nothing about construction, but I knew I'd better learn quickly," she said. "I followed the building superintendent around and noticed that, invariably, when he was inspecting a job he threw his hands in the air and swore. 'You call this a wiring job?' he would scathingly say. I got the hang of it. On my first assignment -- the renovation of a suite in the Towers -- I was quaking in my shoes, but I threw my hands in the air, pointing to a wall and in an aggressive tone, I said. 'You call that an electric outlet?' "
Eventually, Ms. Cohn was named the hotel's director of rehabilitation and was put in charge of planning, budgeting, design oversight for guest rooms. tower suites, meeting and conference rooms and restaurants.
She was also responsible for bidding projects to separate trades, awarding contracts and managing renovations.
"I like paying attention to detail, bringing projects in on time and on budget," she said.
But after three years, she was back in school part time, studying in a program for a master's degree in business administration from New York University.
"I thought it would be very useful to know something about accounting and tax issues if I wanted a job in business," she said. "I became vice president of the Georgetown Company in Manhattan, and one of my responsibilities was coordinating capital projects at the New York Public Library, which stood me in good stead later at New York Botanical Garden."
In the interim, Ms. Cohn married Rabbi Gordon Tucker, had two children and when they were growing up, worked as a commercial real estate broker before going back to work full time.
"The ideal job appeared in a classified ad, and my immediate reaction was: 'Here is a perfect match. A job that combines all my interests and experience,' " she recalled. "The best part about it was that I knew the Botanical Garden as the beautiful place my husband and I loved to visit. We were living in the Bronx then, and we jogged through the Botanical Garden forest very often."
When Ms. Cohn arrived at the garden in December 1989, two major capital projects, the conservatory and the Plants Study Center, a 70,000-square-foot space for the library and botanical collections, had already been planned.
"As the first capital projects director, I was asked to draw up a master plan of other projects," she said. "Two years later, there were 19 additional projects of all sizes in the plan budgeted at $40 million. The first project, the conservatory, began in 1993, and it was of such magnitude that we knew we had to hire an outside construction management firm."
But after a few months, problems appeared.
"There was some trouble with the glazing contractors and then with the painting contract, but the real problem was that we didn't have a direct relationship with the subcontractor," Ms. Cohn said. "When anything had to be changed, we had to go through the construction management people. It was a very costly and inefficient way to operate, and as time went on it was clear we needed a hands-on approach. To do management internally was expedient and economical with big savings in fees and staff. We took direct control, and at the time the old line company George Fuller went out of business, so we were able to pick up some very seasoned construction management people from Fuller."
Ms. Cohn now manages the Botanical Garden's capital projects department and as such oversees the planning, design, bidding, construction, furnishing close-out and completion of new buildings and restoration projects making up a capital projects program of more than $80 million.
"It's an ongoing program," she said. "Currently in the works is the Everett Children's Adventure Garden, eight acres where kids can investigate firsthand how plants live and function and what scientists do. And construction for the Plant Studies Center for the library and Herbarium, to house archival collections and research materials, budgeted at $28 million, is due to start in September."
When she is not at the garden, Ms. Cohn is busy with her duties as a rabbi's wife.
"I lead a dual existence," she said. "In 1994, when my husband became the rabbi of Temple Israel Center in White Plains, we moved to White Plains. Temple Israel is a conservative synagogue with an active membership numbering 850 families. I am involved in everything from weddings to Saturday morning services. We host dinners for new members several times a month at home and also host Shabbat dinners at the synagogue. But I still find time to jog. Most mornings at 6 A.M., I'm out there."

HEADLINE: Q. & A.

 BODY:

Condo Board's Dinner
 
Q. Our town-home condominium homeowners association board, which is elected, gives itself an "appreciation dinner" each year. They also invite the lawyer and committee members. This year's dinner, which requires an expenditure of $3,000, was recently approved by the board. I have written to all homeowners, most of whom do not approve, but the apathy and indifference in the community is so high that no one takes any action. As for electing a new board, we have problems getting people to run. Does the board have the power to do this with our money? . . . Phyllis Spiegel, Plainsboro, N.J.
A. Eric Davis, a real estate lawyer who practices in both New York and New Jersey, said that the New Jersey law regarding condominiums provides that while a condominium board generally has the power to incur expenses on behalf of the condominium association, the board also has an obligation to refrain from fraud and self-dealing and to insure that the actions it takes are not "unconscionable." 
 "In essence, the board must act reasonably and in good faith," Mr. Davis said, adding that, in fact, annual "appreciation dinners" are quite common.
"Many co-ops and condominiums will run a dinner once a year as a way of showing appreciation to board members and to companies and individuals that the board does business with," Mr. Davis said. "You have to remember that in the vast majority of cases, condominium board membership is voluntary. Some board members put in hours and hours each month in furtherance of the condominium association's business. The dinners are a way of providing a small benefit to the non-paid members."
That having been said, however, there is always the possibility that spending $3,000 on a dinner might be considered unreasonable or unconscionable.
"If the dinner is for 10 or 15 people, you're talking about a fairly extraordinary expense," Mr. Davis said, adding that generally, such disputes must ultimately be resolved in court.
 
Piggyback Loan Vs. 2d Mortgage
 
Q. What is meant by a piggyback loan? How is a piggyback loan different from a second mortgage? . . . Tom Resadove, Yonkers
A. Richard Nardi, a Manhattan lawyer who is a past president of the Mortgage Bankers Association of New York, said that the term "piggyback loan" most likely refers to what is more commonly known as a "wrap-around mortgage."
Generally, Mr. Nardi said, such a mortgage is used to provide additional financing on property that is already encumbered by a first mortgage.
Assume that a co-op building has an existing first mortgage with an outstanding principal balance of $500,000 and an annual interest rate of 8 percent. The co-op needs to borrow $100,000 for capital improvements. With an ordinary second mortgage, the co-op would be obligated to make two mortgage payments every month -- one on the first mortgage and another on the new second mortgage.
With a wrap-around mortgage, however, the face amount of the new loan is the total of the outstanding balance on the first mortgage and the amount of new money being borrowed. While the borrower's new monthly payment is based on the total of both loans, the borrower actually receives only the new money. At the same time, however, the lender agrees -- in writing -- to make monthly payments on the borrower's original first mortgage as they come due.
Mr. Nardi said that one reason such mortgages are offered is because lenders can make more money from them. For example, he said, using the above situation, if a lender provides the co-op with a $600,000 wrap-around mortgage at an annual interest rate of 10 percent, the lender makes 10 percent on the $100,000 of "new" money and 2 percent on the remaining $500,000. The 2 percent "bonus" results from the fact that the borrower's original mortgage is being repaid by the new lender at the original interest rate of 8 percent.
And while it might seem foolish for a borrower to agree to such terms, Mr. Nardi said, there are times -- particularly when a borrower has credit or cash-flow problems -- when such a loan is the only kind he can obtain.

Working the Angles in Low-Budget Paradise

BYLINE: By PETER M. NICHOLS 

DATELINE: SHREVEPORT, La.

 BODY:
IT'S A MODERATELY TENSE moment on a set high in the Louisiana Tower. Gliding into an office on in-line skates, a tall, stunning blonde in a red vinyl jumpsuit with deep decolletage and open midriff swoops around a desk and plunks herself down at a computer terminal. Carrie Ann Westcott was the centerfold in the September 1993 issue of Playboy magazine ("the back-to-school issue," she notes), but here she is portraying Sofia, an agent of evil forces on a global grab for treasure.
Posing as a pizza deliverywoman, Sofia has skated into the usually tightly guarded offices of Lethal (Legion to Assure Total Harmony and Law) and is about to make off with some crucial information from the computer. Across the desk, the cinematographer Howard Wexler leans into a viewfinder. Over his shoulder peers Andy Sidaris, a B-movie director with never a second's doubt about exactly what he wants in front of the camera. "That's great, sweetie, now look around warily," he tells Sofia. "Look back at the computer. Now hit the enter key." 
 Mr. Sidaris and his wife, Arlene, who produces his movies, have brought their small and smoothly functioning Skyhawks Films team from Hollywood to Shreveport to shoot some of the more expensive parts of "Return to Savage Beach," a straight-to-video action epic to rival his "Day of the Warrior," a best renter this year, and earlier Sidaris thrillers like "Fit to Kill," "Hard Hunted," "Guns" and "Savage Beach," the forerunner of the production at hand.
Sofia pecks at the keyboard, prompting a spray of colorful graphics on the computer screen. If there's anything tenser than a Sidaris scenario, it's a Skyhawks budget, which hangs by a shoestring. Authoritative computer display is a must in an action film, and since it needn't cost much, even a production as thrifty as this one can afford to put a good show onto the monitor. It's the explosions, the shootouts, the boat and motorcycle chases that take some inventiveness.
The Sidarises won't say what one of their films costs, but Mr. Sidaris allows that it's in the neighborhood of $1 million, a pittance as action movies go. Several days before, "Return to Savage Beach" blew up a speedboat out on Cross Lake and staged a major gun battle in a city park. A Bruce Willis movie pays a lot for scenes like these, partly because they require, as a safety precaution, the presence of police officers and firefighters. "In Los Angeles, a cop is $45 an hour from the time he leaves the house," Mr. Sidaris says. Shreveport, a town that loves to be in the movies, provides its services free of charge.
A Sidaris production is cleverly geared to such economies, one sign of an operation that knows exactly how to get along in the tough lower precincts of American filmmaking. These days, higher standards and increased competition demand a considerable amount of acumen from a B-movie maker. The Sidarises won't divulge income, but with cast and crew working at wages described as modest but fair, they perform at peak efficiency.
Skyhawks films go straight to video, and after that, they move on to cable, where they have loyal audiences and play for years. Distributors say that Sidaris movies work because, despite the small amounts spent on them, they look relatively sleek and glamorous, which is a must these days even for films that don't play in theaters.
Mr. Sidaris, a short, effusive man in his mid-60's, is a former producer and director for ABC Sports who won seven Emmys before he got tired of that field and started making movies in the 1980's.
"They're small pictures, but they have big vistas and views," he says. Some critics credit the look to clever cinematography, Mr. Sidaris's editing skills and scenes that seem to jump around the world -- even if the filming never leaves Shreveport.
Mr. Sidaris owns homes in Beverly Hills and Hawaii (fruits of his sports producing and not his filmmaking, he says), but he was reared here and knows everybody. Situated in the northwest corner of the state, about 185 miles east of Dallas, Shreveport prides itself on being a regional center of movie and television-commercial making. In addition to providing city services as a gesture of good will, Shreveport and environs offer a variety of looks and feels. Swamps, for instance.
"A lot of people think they have better swamps down in the bayous, but we have some of the best ones right here," says Betty Jo Lebrun, executive director of the city's film commission.
Being close to Texas, the countryside also has a flat western look. In the middle of that is a city skyline. Outside town, Cross Lake is perfect for careening Jet Skis and sumptuous-looking yachting scenes. The Louisiana Downs race track has suites and backdrops good for trysts and chicanery, and along the Red River, which winds through the city, casinos with names like Harrah's lend that Las Vegas touch.
Fees, if any, are minimal. At the Pelican Inn, a sprawling motel hard by the airport, the Sidarises swung a deal to lodge cast and crew, about 15 in all, for $700 a day. That's total, including dinners for everybody. After Sofia's computer scene (shot rent-free in the offices of an oil exploration company), everybody repairs to the noisy, smoky Pelican dining room. "I don't like to give them a per diem," says Mr. Sidaris. "If I gave them per diem, they'd spread out all over town. I want them to be like family."
Around the room, actors and technicians sprawl, chatter and act down-home, or as down-home as its gets with two former Penthouse Pets and two ex-Playboy centerfolds in the cast and an assortment of very L.A. film people. Mr. Sidaris eats fried chicken and table-hops. A voluble and supportive dictator who may be grumbled about occasionally, he generally commands affection and respect from an industrious group of actors and crew who appreciate the fact that they have work. No one complains publicly about the Pelican. "You wouldn't get Sharon Stone here, but that's not what this is about," Mr. Sidaris says.
Skyhawks movies might be categorized as an extremely low-cost cross between James Bond and "Baywatch": thighs, spies, bikinis and ballistics, as one person on the set says. That's true, but the Sidaris approach is, if pure macho, quite clean and scrubbed. Certainly there is violence, but people who get shot or blown up often miraculously recover. As for sex, scenes are shot once topless, for the R-rated video version, and again with tops in place for the movie that will be shown on television. Either way, the effect is more gymnastic than erotic. "We have no heavy profanity because I don't like that," Mr. Sidaris says.
Parts of "Return to Savage Beach" were shot in Dallas, Malibu, Beverly Hills and Hawaii, and the plot is a pastiche of every cliche character, situation, gimmick and gadget from every spy movie ever made. Simply put, the gorgeous operatives of Lethal, three women and two men with names like Cobra, Tiger and Doc, are locked in combat with Martinez (portrayed by Rodrigo Obregon, a swarthy Colombian with classically villainous looks) and ninja-terrorist types in pursuit of a horde of gold stolen from the Philippines by Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos.
Dialogue proceeds apace. "They've managed to smuggle guns, rockets, high-tech detonators and plastique explosives from China and the Pacific Rim up through Mexico to the heartland of our country," exclaims Doc, a hunky Lethal agent (Paul Logan, a martial-arts expert). "I'll hit the computer satellite fax and fill everyone in," says Tiger (Shae Marks, May 1994 Playboy centerfold), Lethal's technology wizard.
Mr. Sidaris writes the scripts, sometimes between tennis games at his large Beverly Hills house. He admits the scenarios are silly. "The idea is to have fun," he says. As with everything else about a Sidaris movie, scripts don't waste time. One instruction for a love scene reads, "Cobra and Doc lovage here, details TBA."
In most movies, one page of script translates to a minute of film. For a movie that will run about 90 minutes, Mr. Sidaris has written a script of only 49 pages, so there is a lot of room for on-the-set rewrites and those things a Sidaris film does best, which is pose good-looking actors against glamorous-looking backdrops. The next day begins with some shots of beautiful people at the Shreveport Yacht Club on the lake.
FORMERLY IN CHARGE OF ABC's "Wide World of Sports" and major events like the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City, Mr. Sidaris is used to keeping tabs on up to 75 screens at once. Unlike many directors, he never uses a video tap (a scope that views a scene as it appears on screen) but lets his eyes prowl as they did in the old days in a control room.
"The guy has the most incredible instinct for what works," says Mr. Wexler, the cinematographer. An angle or juxtaposition is chosen instantly. Instructions are terse but always supportive. If a line is missed, the camera keeps rolling while it is tried again. Sidaris actors may not be Wynona Ryder or Daniel Day-Lewis, but they work hard, and he tries not to embarrass them.
The Sidaris production rolls around Shreveport in a rented truck, two vans and whatever civilian vehicles happen to be handy. A leased motor home transports the cast. Always there is the pressure of time and money. Every shot turns out great, even if it doesn't. "That was absolutely wonderful, sweetheart," Mr. Sidaris says. "That's a wrappage. We're done here, right, Howard?"
A Sidaris movie typically uses 50,000 feet of film. Many directors shoot that much just for tests. At the yacht club, Mr. Sidaris wonders if they are running short and should they send to Los Angeles for more? Mr. Wexler says they'll make it.
On the sidelines the actors apply sun block and sit in camp chairs bearing their names written on strips of masking tape. One production assistant, a recent graduate of Centenary College in Shreveport, is headed for the Yale School of Drama in the fall. Asked if she expects to see anything like this in New Haven, she says she guesses not.
One of her professors at Centenary, Jeff Hendricks, is serving as assistant director of "Return to Savage Beach." He describes a Sidaris movie as a strain of post-modernism, all parody and excess. "It gets at the absurdity of materialism," Mr. Hendricks says, "or that's how the culture critic might look at it." Other folks, he says, actually take the stuff literally.
That afternoon, two Lethal agents (Mr. Logan and Cristian Letelier, a singer and a dancer as well as an actor) get jumped by three ninjas in a shady backyard in the wooded Shreveport suburbs. The only safety official on hand today is Marshall Peacock, whose card identifies him as a certified instructor of the National Rifle Association, which, he says, regularly dispatches firearms experts to the scenes of action movies.
Mr. Peacock is the keeper of the guns, about a half-dozen of them, which he doles out to actors as needed. There's the Uzi, a couple of large automatics and two more small handguns suitable for a woman's boot, bag or bosom. Most impressive is the .44-caliber, a huge four-pound revolver made famous by Clint Eastwood in "Dirty Harry."
If his belt holds up, Mr. Logan will pack that one in the forthcoming battle of the backyard. The ninjas, two young men recruited from Tracy's Karate Den in Shreveport, work out gracefully with Marcus Young, a mild-mannered fight coordinator brought in from Los Angeles. It seems that every town in America has martial-arts studios teeming with young men who could kick the stuffing out of anybody on a movie set. The Jackie Chan phenomenon did it, Mr. Young says. Everybody's a karate star. Best of all, they're free.
These ninjas, affable young men in black-hooded karate get-ups, say movie fighting is a lot slower than what they normally do. Nevertheless they wear padded chest protectors against Mr. Logan, a swift and accomplished opponent. Throughout the afternoon the brawl goes splendidly, with bodies flying and hitting the lawn with satisfying womps.
A director of countless football games and boxing matches on television, Mr. Sidaris gets the most from a fight scene. Before the action begins, he fiddles with 17 pairs of Ray Ban sunglasses, donated by the company. With him is Julie Strain, a Penthouse Pet of the Year, who plays Commander Willow Black, the chief Lethal agent. A fixture in Sadaris films, Ms. Strain stands 6 feet 1 (6 feet 8 in stiletto heels), and today she is wearing a little leather outfit that makes her look like Xena, the warrior princess, only with a lot less on underneath.
Leather is definitely Ms. Strain's material -- "You smell like a new car," a lover tells her in the movie -- but on the set she is regarded as a sort of den mother who cheerfully looks out for the other women, even sharing her own $20,000 wardrobe she has brought from Los Angeles (forget that kind of expenditure on this production).
Sidaris women have been described as "top-heavy." As Ms. Strain describes it, the typical Sidaris audition consists of a visit with Andy and Arlene at their home in Beverly Hills. Candidates are asked to take their clothes off and are inspected for nicks and bruises. Then they run a lap or two around the tennis court. "They want to see what jiggles," Ms. Strain says.
Each Sidaris movie needs several love scenes. "It's the foreign market; distributors won't touch it otherwise," Ms. Strain explains. "If the girls had their choice, they wouldn't do it, but it's part of the package."
On the movie's next to last day in Shreveport, a sex scene is shot in a strip club called, oddly enough, the Centerfold. On tap is Julie Smith, or Little Julie, a lithe, athletic former Penthouse Pet, who dons a naughty, abbreviated policewoman's outfit, then slithers and climbs all over Mr. Logan. But the look is more dance than lust. Ms. Smith classifies Sidaris films as innocent, tongue-in-cheek fantasies. She says she doesn't feel exploited. "It doesn't pay the rent and there are no great scripts, but it's work I can believe in," she says.
Outside the club, Mr. Wexler sets up the camera for an exterior shot. In the film, the Centerfold is supposed to be an upscale establishment in Beverly Hills. In Shreveport, the actuality falls short of that. Mr. Sidaris hustles about with a hose watering the bushes and the black paving by the front door. Mr. Wexler inserts a purple filter and suddenly through the lens the watered-down entrance takes on a lustrous, tonier appearance.
Shreveport is also the home of Barksdale Air Force Base, which houses many of the country's B-52 bombers. The Centerfold is close to the runway and overhead the huge aircraft, flaps spread and belching long trails of black smoke from roaring engines, are landing one after the other. Mr. Sidaris has a sudden brainstorm. "Got enough film, Howard?" he asks. Mr. Wexler does and swings the camera to film the next B-52 on its approach.
Maybe a terrorist takeover of one of those things in the next film. And why not?

HEADLINE: Uneasy Freedom for the Once Fettered

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING 

DATELINE: KARLOVY VARY, Czech Republic

 BODY:
WHILE MOSCOW WAS RULING Eastern Europe, the region's movie makers knew where they stood. If they made conformist films, they were assured of Government financing. If they stepped out of line, their films would be banned. Yet, as soon as political controls were relaxed in Czechoslovakia, Poland and Hungary at different moments of the 1960's and 1970's, directors of the stature of Milos Forman and Roman Polanski promptly appeared. Surely, then, with the collapse of Communism, a new New Wave of Eastern European movies would not tarry.
So, where is it? 
 The last eight years have changed the region beyond recognition. Ancient lands have rediscovered their identities; new countries have been created. Most have freely elected governments, and many have come to terms with the good and the greed of market economies. Last month, the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary were even invited to enter NATO. Yet, puzzlingly, in cinema, that most exportable of art forms, expectations have so far been disappointed. Could it be that democracy is a lesser muse than dictatorship?
Certainly, freedom's unannounced arrival stunned the region's filmmakers. They were no longer muzzled but, as Government subsidies were slashed or canceled, they struggled to find money for even low-budget productions. New television stations, cable channels and booming video sales began stealing traditional moviegoing audiences, forcing hundreds of dilapidated Government-owned movie theaters to close. Surviving theaters -- plus a handful of new cineplexes -- were soon showing Hollywood movies almost exclusively.
Then there was the predicament faced by directors who for so long had been silenced or had been forced to convey their screen message through obscure codes and symbols in a kind of unspoken conspiracy with audiences.
"When you're not allowed to talk, you know what you want to say," explained Mr. Forman, the Czech director who made his name with such films as "Loves of a Blonde" and "The Firemen's Ball" during the Prague "spring" of the mid-1960's and who opted for exile in the United States after the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968. "Censorship identifies what's worth talking about. But when you're free, you have to decide what's important. And that's more difficult."
There were other unpleasant surprises. Under Communism, American and European audiences eagerly embraced Soviet bloc movies that "escaped" to the West -- those by, say, Mr. Forman, Jiri Menzel ("Closely Watched Trains") and Jan Nemec ("The Report on the Party and the Guests") from Czechoslovakia, or Mr. Polanski ("Knife in the Water") and Andrzej Wajda ("Ashes and Diamonds") from Poland, or Istvan Szabo ("Mephisto") from Hungary. Then, almost overnight, Eastern European films found themselves struggling no less than other foreign-language productions to find distributors in the United States and Western Europe. If once the magical aura of political dissidence had sufficed, now they had to measure up as entertainment.
Still, if at times they have come close to despair since 1989, filmmakers in Eastern Europe have not given up, above all in the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary, countries with traditions worth reviving. Directors love to list the problems they face, yet films -- probably more than 100 a year -- continue to be made in the former Soviet bloc. Some Government financing is available, but for the first time, real producers exist. In the past, governments determined movie budgets; now independent producers must put together complex packages involving domestic and Western European investors, the Council of Europe's Eurimages Fund and, above all, newly affluent television companies.
The great majority of the movies made in the region since 1990 have been eminently forgettable: cheap pastiches of American action films, and soft-porn movies galore. "The number of films generating little public interest and at the same time lacking redeeming artistic qualities is on the increase," the Czech Ministry of Culture noted chastisingly in a report on the Czech industry in March.
Yet there are encouraging signs. Across the region, serious directors have begun tackling the great untouchable subjects of the last half-century, from the Nazi occupation and the Holocaust to the tedium and oppression of the Communist years. Some, among them Krzysztof Kieslowski, the Polish director who gained international acclaim for "Blue," "White" and "Red" before dying last year, have also looked at the new moral questions posed by the onslaught of primitive capitalism.
This very seriousness also poses a problem. Many moviegoers in Eastern Europe prefer the escapism of Hollywood (and even locally made) action movies to the discomfort of confronting an unpleasant past and a confusing present. In any event, the blockbusters are what is on offer because theater owners feel more secure showing American movies, which now account for more than 90 percent of the box-office take in the region. Further, the dramatic drop in the number of available screens (from 3,081 in Bulgaria in 1989 to just 209 in 1996, for instance) insures that thoughtful movies from Eastern Europe can be seen by few people, even in their countries of origin.
FAIRLY TYPICAL IS "Bolshe Vita," a film by the Hungarian newcomer Ibolya Fekete about three Russian men and two Western women who meet in Budapest as Communism crumbles. It was well received in several festivals but was seen by just 4,700 people over a 10-week period when it was released in Hungary last year. In contrast, Istvan Bujtor's "Three Guardsmen in Africa," a locally made comedy with no political content, drew 207,000 moviegoers, but even so it ranked only eighth, behind American films like "Independence Day" and "Twister," among the hits of 1996.
Unsurprisingly, Eastern European films that have won prizes in festivals struggle to find buyers in Western Europe and the United States. Emir Kusturica's "Underground," a surrealistic allegory about postwar Yugoslavia, which won the Palme d'Or in Cannes in 1995, was ignored by American distributors. Even acclaimed films that make the art-house circuit in the United States -- among them "Before the Rain," by Milcho Manchevski of Macedonia; "Burnt by the Sun," by Nikita Mikhalkov of Russia, and "A Chef in Love," by Nana Djordjadze of Georgia -- can expect to earn little. No less than, say, French movies, they run up against the infamous American resistance to subtitles.
So far, only one post-cold-war movie from Eastern Europe -- "Kolya" by Jan Sverak of the Czech Republic -- has been a big success. Still showing in the United States six months after its release, this poignant story of an abandoned Russian boy and a womanizing Czech bachelor won the Academy Award for best foreign-language film this year and has so far earned almost $13 million worldwide. Made for $1.3 million, it has become a beacon of hope for other filmmakers, but it shines as an exception.
The Karlovy Vary International Film Festival, which took place three weeks ago, hopes to change this. Throughout the Communist era, this elegant spa town formerly known as Carlsbad, in the western Czech Republic, was host for a biennial festival of Government-approved films from the Soviet bloc. It also carefully selected movies from the West "to show how bad it was over there and how good it was here," recalled Rudolf Biermann, the festival's general manager. Now, however, the festival has been revamped to be held annually and sees its role as a display window -- and above all a marketplace -- for the best movies from Eastern Europe.
"It's very important to give space to this cinema," said Eva Zaoralova, the festival's director. "In the past, the Cannes and Berlin festivals would look for films from Russia, Hungary or Poland, but now they say there is nothing interesting being done there, that there's a crisis of esthetics. I don't think this is true. But since these festivals are snubbing Eastern Europe, we can profit from this and make our own discoveries."
This year's festival included 7 films from Eastern Europe among the 18 in the official competition. None were masterpieces, but all were worth watching. Thirty-five other films from the region were shown out of competition, along with nine films made by Czech television. A two-day seminar on movie distribution brought together experts from Poland, Slovenia, Hungary, Russia, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and the United States. And as a measure of the Czech Government's interest, the festival was opened by Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus and closed by President Vaclav Havel. Actual American distributors, though, were noteworthy for their absence.
Still, the Czechs, at least, have some reason for optimism -- and not only because of "Kolya," which was a huge box-office hit at home before it began collecting prizes abroad. When the Velvet Revolution and the end of Communism came, movie production slumped from 35 in 1989 to just 6 in 1990; now 20 to 22 new movies are being made annually. The legendary Barrandov Studios have been privatized. And while the company is currently in disarray after the ouster of its director, Vaclav Marhoul, in a power struggle with the majority shareholder, the studios have the space and equipment to support growth of the local movie industry.
Some veteran directors, like Mr. Menzel, Vera Chytilova and Juraj Jakubisco, are still making films, but they have not recaptured the magic of their pre-1968 work.
"I was the only one who was able to keep working," explained Mr. Forman, whose American-made movies have included "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," "Hair," "Amadeus" and, most recently, "The People vs. Larry Flynt." "The others were banned for two to five years after 1968. That kind of unwilling interruption is like a knife in your back. You never recover. That was, more or less, the fate of my generation."
TODAY, MORE INTEREST has been stirred by several young directors in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Mr. Sverak, 32, who had already been noticed with "The Elementary School" before "Kolya" made him a star, is preparing a movie in English about Czech pilots who fought alongside the Allies in World War II and were later sent to Communist labor camps as collaborators.
Vladimir Michalek, 39, is currently shooting "It's Necessary to Kill Sekal," also set in World War II. In contrast, his last film, "Forgotten Light," which won praise at last month's festival here, is set in Communist Czechoslovakia and parallels a young Roman Catholic priest's effort to save his church from being closed with his growing love for a dying parishioner.
Others are making more intimate films. "Blue Heaven," a first film by Eva Borusovicova, 27, who is still a student in the Slovak film school in Bratislava, portrays the conflicting dreams and stormy cohabitation of a young woman, her mother and her grandmother.
In Poland, too, the movie industry is stirring. After a sharp slump in 1992 and 1993, audiences are beginning to return to theaters, while new productions are now averaging 40 a year, thanks to continuing Government subsidies and major investment by Polish television. Older directors like Mr. Wajda are still at work, although the most important Polish director of the early 1990's was undoubtedly Kieslowski who, after a 15-year career, was finally hailed as a maestro through "The Double Life of Veronique" and the "Three Colors" trilogy. His death in March 1996, at the age of 54, was a blow to all European cinema.
New names, though, are arriving with strong stories. In "Temptation," Barbara Sass has turned the clock back to Stalinist Poland, where a young nun charged with a political crime is released from prison on condition that she return to her convent to spy on a dissident priest. With "Pigs," Wladyslaw Pasikowski borrows American police-thriller techniques to tell a gripping story about two former political policemen who are forced to answer for their activities after the demise of the Communist regime. Dorota Kedzierzawska has followed her debut film, "Devils, Devils," with "Crows," a psychological drama about the kidnapping of a 3-year-old child by a lonely prepubescent girl.
In Hungary there is also official interest in rebuilding the movie industry. And with 15 to 20 new films per year, audiences for Hungarian films, principally comedies, are slowly growing. But many directors continue to bemoan the need to go cap-in-hand in search of financing. "In the old regime, the problem was ideological censorship," said Ildiko Szabo, who has made "Child Murders" and "Bitches" since 1990. "Now it's the censorship of money."
Still, at least in festivals, several Hungarian directors have been noticed. Janos Szasz's version of Georg Buchner's play "Woyzeck" was praised by Variety as "involving, moving, intelligent." His next film, "The Witman Boys," was a dark tale of matricide. Peter Gothar, already spotted in the West in 1981 for "Time Stands Still," continues to make gripping movies, like "Vaska Easoff," which tells of an urban thief and a rural thief who join forces to steal czarist gold from Soviet bank vaults.
The Karlovy Vary festival also demonstrated that unusual films could come even from countries with rudimentary movie industries. "Late Full Moon" by the Bulgarian director Eduard Zachariev, who died last year at the age of 59, portrays the dark side of "freedom" through an elderly man who, disgusted by the manic materialism of his son's family, finds contentment living with Gypsies on a garbage dump. In "The Wolf-Tooth Necklace," a much-admired film by Algimantas Pulpa of Lithuania, 46, a painter-writer recalls his upbringing by his mother and his grandparents after his father's deportation to Siberia.
Even Russia, where the movie industry seems close to collapse, occasionally produces noteworthy films. At the festival, Russia was represented by Aleksei Balabanov's "Brother," a fast-paced story about the country's chaotic transition from Communism in which a former conscript joins his hired-gun brother in St. Petersburg and is drawn into a shadowy world. It is a measure of the distribution crisis in Russia that "Brother" cannot find a domestic distributor and will go straight to video.
So, at least for older filmmakers, nostalgia for a simpler past with handout budgets and assured theater releases is perhaps understandable. By contrast, many younger Eastern European directors seem unperturbed by the current uncertainty, even by the invasion of American movies. And it is this generation -- "free of the eccentricities and idiosyncrasies of the past," as Mr. Forman put it -- that will determine whether Eastern Europe can again become a cradle of original movies. Yet, without the unifying straitjacket of Communism, even the term "Eastern European cinema" may soon become a misnomer. Under the new rules of the game, only the ability to combine talent and business acumen will count.
"I have no wish to be close to Eastern Europe because we spent so many years together without positive results," said Mr. Sverak, the director of "Kolya." "To be frank, when I notice a Latvian film in the program, I have no desire to see it. Or a Hungarian or a Bulgarian or a Romanian film or whatever. It's better to talk to those you can learn from. What the United States can teach us is marketing."
He should know because he has seen it happen.
" 'Kolya' was picked up by Miramax at last year's Cannes festival," he said. "Within a day, we had sold the film to 20 other territories. The film's first international release was in the United States in January this year, so it was Miramax's marketing that hit the world. We've now sold it to over 40 countries. It's the marketing power of the United States that counts."

HEADLINE: Redevelopment Enriching Baltimore's Inner Harbor

BYLINE: By ROBERT SHAROFF 

DATELINE: BALTIMORE

 BODY:
THE redevelopment of this city's waterfront into a retail and entertainment district -- one of the big downtown success stories over the last 20 years -- is continuing with several new mixed-use projects that promise to add a new dimension to what is already a thriving tourist destination.
The projects include two renovations of historic, but long empty, properties and a third that involves both renovation and substantial new construction. 
 The project with the highest profile -- if only because of its location in the heart of what's called the Inner Harbor, the hub of the redevelopment effort, is the renovation of the Power Plant complex, three massive brick buildings that have dominated the waterfront since 1895. The buildings originally housed coal-fired electrical generating equipment for the city trolley system.
In the late 1980's they were taken over by Six Flags Theme Parks for an entertainment center that lasted less than a year. Now, the Cordish Company, a national developer based here that specializes in downtown "festival marketplace" projects such as Bayou Place in Houston and Charleston Place in Charleston, S.C., has signed a 99-year lease with the city for the complex. It expects to spend about $20 million to convert it into an office and entertainment center.
"It will be a major new anchor for the Inner Harbor," said Joseph Weinberg, vice president of Cordish.
The three buildings, which range in height from 94 to 120 feet, have a total of 150,000 square feet of space. Cordish's plan calls for three levels, or about 115,000 square feet, of retail with the rest devoted to offices. Plans for the project have been drawn up by Design Collective, an architectural firm based here.
"The challenge is making the building as inviting and accessible as possible both for the public and for tenants," said Richard Burns, a principal with Design Collective.
Mr. Burns said his plans called for, among other things, replacing an exterior wall of the project with glass to show off the four 200-foot-tall smokestacks that rise through the interior of the middle building. "We want to open the building up and show what's amazing about it -- the incredible steel and bolts and trusses," he said. "It has a wonderful 1890's industrial feel to it. They don't build buildings like this anymore.'
The stacks -- or at least the plan for the stacks -- have already caused a lot of talk in town. Early in July, the first tenant -- the Hard Rock Cafe --- moved in and immediately hung a 65-foot neon guitar on one of the stacks. Mr. Burns said that the stacks would also be outfitted with laser lights and might be made to smoke again, but only for decorative purposes. "The guitar has been very controversial," said Laurie Feinberg, a planner in the city's Planning Department. "People are afraid they're going too far with it, making the whole thing too loud and tacky."
But it seems to be working. "We always look for a 'wow' factor in terms of locations and the Power Plant has that," said James Berk, chief executive of Hard Rock Cafe chain. He added that the restaurant had performed considerably above expectations since it opened and that "if it keeps up at this rate, it will equal New York in terms of volume."
The project's second anchor, a 30,000-square-foot Barnes & Noble book store, will open this fall. The rest of the project will be finished by next summer.
Both Hard Rock and Barnes & Noble represent the kind of major national force that has not been much in evidence along the reinvigorated waterfront. Indeed, when Barnes & Noble opens it will be the largest retailer in downtown Baltimore.
"For the first time in 10 years we're seeing a resurgence in downtown retail,"' said Neil Tucker, a broker with CB Commercial here.
RENTS, however, still lag behind the top suburban malls. According to Rene Daniel, president of the Daniel Group, a real estate consulting firm here, the best retail space along the harbor goes for about $20 to $24 a square foot, compared with $25 to $30 a square foot in the suburbs.
The other two projects are in Canton, a neighborhood at the eastern end of the seven-and-a-half mile public promenade that defines the downtown waterfront redevelopment district. The promenade, a brick walkway created in the late 1960's, extends along the harbor through four distinct neighborhoods -- Canton, Fell's Point, Inner Harbor and Federal Hill.
All of this land, largely industrial for most of Baltimore's history, is now being converted to residential and commercial uses.
The Canton projects are the renovation of the old American Can Company complex and the renovation and construction of Lighthouse Point, a new marina and boat storage complex that involves partially renovating an old licorice factory and adding several new buildings. Both are within a block of each other on Boston Street, which follows the shoreline.
The American Can project consists of five buildings erected over roughly 30 years beginning in 1895. The former American Can Company vacated the site in 1988 and it has been vacant and deteriorating ever since. Struever Bros. Eccles & Rouse, a local firm known for innovative renovation projects, took over the site a year ago and is beginning a $24 million overhaul.
When it is finished sometime after the first of the the year, there will be about 50,000 square feet of retail space on the first floor and 125,000 square feet of office space on the remaining three floors. "This will be the biggest office building in Canton," said William Struever, president of Struever Bros. The architecture firm handling the renovation is again Design Collective Inc.
Mr. Struever said that several anchor tenants were already in place for the project. Like the Power Plant, the main retail tenant is a book store, a branch of the local Bibelot chain. The main tenant over all, with 50,000 square feet, will be the Maryland Economic Development Corporation, a quasi-public group that plans to use the space as an incubator for fledgling high tech companies.
The final project is Lighthouse Point. In addition to a 490-slip marina and a "boatel" that will store up to 200 boats year-round, the site consists of a boat-repair facility, a pool and cabana club and 50,000 square feet of office space. Also on the drawing board is a 30-unit luxury town-house development.
The developer of the project is East Harbor Marine Center, a limited partnership of seven partners, several of whom are doctors and all of whom are active in boating. According to Dora Naor, one of the partners, the project will costing about $24 million and all but the town houses will be finished this fall.
"This will be the most comprehensive marina in Baltimore," she said, "and the only one that offers year round high and dry storage."

HEADLINE: Roadside Cornucopia

BYLINE: By GEORGE JAMES 

DATELINE: LONG VALLEY

 BODY:
THE Ort family's farm stand sits on the side of a country road between Schooley's Mountain four miles away, where the first Ort bought a farm in 1866, and the old white farmhouse across the road, where the family moved around 1916.
It is a classic New Jersey farm stand, long and low, a 50-by-30-foot shed of weathered red barn siding and flaking white trim, largely open in front, just off a two-lane blacktop road. 
 The stand was built around 1975 on a potato patch where, in the late 1960's, the Orts had placed a farm wagon to display their produce, shaded by two large umbrellas. And long before that, they sold fruit and vegetables from picnic tables under the three maple trees in front of the farmhouse.
"My grandfather sold raspberries and strawberries and potatoes and stuff like that back in the 1930's," said the current patriarch, 70-year-old Harvey Ort Sr. "And then my daughters, when they were growing up, they always sold stuff on the front lawn under the maple trees. It was getting so dangerous with traffic we decided to put something on the other side of the road."
Ron Good, an agricultural marketing specialist for the State Department of Agriculture, estimates there are between 700 to 800 farm stands statewide in just about every county, ranging from a wagon or shed like the Orts' to the mega-stand -- barnlike metal buildings that function more like stores.
Some farm stands are even more elaborate, he said, mentioning DePiero's Country Farm, a huge modern structure across from Mercedes-Benz headquarters in Montvale, Bergen County, that has its own restaurant.
Mr. Good, who helps farmers market their produce more efficiently, says farm stands have proliferated over the last 30 years, especially in the last decade as an increasing number of farmers have taken to selling directly to a public that has become more health-conscious.
Mr. Ort and his wife, Edith, have 10 children, 19 grandchildren and 3 great-grandchildren. Only two sons, Harvey Jr. and John, and a daughter, Janie Hoskin, are actively involved in running the farm.
But come autumn, when swarms of customers ride in hay wagons pulled by John Deere tractors to pick their own pumpkins and the children gather to pet the farm animals that are John's responsibility (including Sam, a gentle 2,000-pound black steer), the whole family turns out to sell and lend a hand.
"In the fall, I would say, on any given day, you could probably say you need 7 or 8 of the kids and probably 8 to 10 of the grandchildren." said Harvey Jr., 41, who manages the farm. "Some of the grandchildren tow wagons with pumpkins to the cars."
BUT right now is that lush time of year when people go to farm stands from as near as down the road and far away as New York City and Philadelphia, looking for the perfect tomato or ear of sweet corn, just as at Halloween they go to buy pumpkins and in December Christmas trees.
You see the tourists in greater numbers on weekends as they set out with the children in the back seat for a drive in the country. And you see the regulars on weekdays, the housewives coming for the morning's first fresh crop and the businessmen, truckers and commuters stopping in the evening on their way home for the most freshly picked produce.
And as they hand their money to the cashier, who may be the farmer's daughter or grandson or family friend, that tomato takes on a symbolism that is dearer than the tomato itself.
They are buying fresh, customers say; they are buying healthy, and they are getting the good feeling of knowing they are directly supporting a farm family rather than a supermarket chain. And there is something nostalgic in the process that touches America's pastoral myth and their own personal past.
"There is a nice feeling between the farmer and consumers because the farmer is not only providing them with the experience of eating that freshly picked tomato but also bringing back the memory of the freshness they first tasted as children, when they may have picked a tomato from their grandfather's farm or mother's garden," said Mr. Good, who grew up on a farm in Ohio. "Farm stands, with their fresh produce, can create all these pleasant images."
The farm stand, on Bartley Road near Route 24 about four miles from Chester, is open from 9 A.M. to 7 P.M. daily from Easter through Christmas, when it is shuttered for the winter. Janie Ort Hoskin, who manages it, arrives each day at 8 A.M. to set out the produce.
At 48, she is the third of Harvey Sr. and Edith's 10 children, and like her mother before her, she has been working at the stand for many years. Her daughter Sandy, 18, has been working with her since she was a child but has been spending less time since beginning her studies to be a nurse.
"Both my boys worked here," Mrs. Hoskin says. "Basically, all the nieces and nephews worked here one time or other."
A survey of New Jersey farmers released in 1994 by the Department of Agricultural Economics and Marketing at Cook College of Rutgers University revealed that most farmers who responded prefer selling their produce retail -- at farm stands or at the 48 farmers markets statewide -- rather than wholesale because the returns are higher and they can sell in limited quantities.
The Cook College survey also revealed that gross retail sales ranged from $10,000 to $5 million (for perhaps three or four large farms). The average was about $221,000. Mr. Good, the marketing specialist, said many farmers fell in the middle range.
Ramu Govindasamy, a marketing specialist at Cook College, estimates that farms that sell retail recive about 25 percent of their total gross sales from farm stands
Harvey Ort Jr. said his farm sold about 50 percent of its produce retail and estimated that 75 percent of those gross retail sales came from the farm stand. The remaining 25 percent are derived from seven farmers' markets within a 25-mile radius.
"We try to retail as much as we can," he says, noting that among the principal fresh market vegetables the Orts grow are tomatoes, sweet corn, peppers, cabbage, cucumbers, lettuce, eggplants, snap beans and asparagus. They also grow melons and strawberries.
The Orts raise 75 percent of what they sell. What they don't have, like peaches, Mrs. Hoskin orders from other farmers.
About 10 years ago, Harvey Jr. began raising flowers in greenhouses to tide the farm over in the spring, and two years ago he put in a half-acre of flowers that customers can cut themselves. The Orts also sell hay to horse farms in the area and grain to brokers and mills.
He estimated that 75 percent of the farm's gross sales came from edible products and 25 percent from the grain and hay. The Orts also have 19 cows, 35 sheep, 10 goats, 20 chickens and 4 pigs, some of which are sold to other farms or at market.
The stand also sells Amish craft work, from birdhouses to lawn furniture, that Harvey Ort Sr. buys on his regular trips to Lancaster, Pa.
Each morning before 7, Harvey Jr. is in the fields with two or three hired hands picking the corn and tomatoes he will sell retail at the stand and wholesale to seven other farmers with farm stands in the area.
The corn is stacked on two large bins on the far wall, which is covered with old framed photographs of Long Valley that Harvey Ort Sr., a local history buff, put there. Near the doorway to a small back room is a framed photo of his father, Jacob Wack Ort, standing in front of a 1930's car. It was Jacob who bought this property and the farmhouse across the road in 1916. Another photo shows Jacob's father, Harvey S. Ort, whose father, William Henry Ort, a Civil War veteran, bought the farm on Schooley's Mountain in 1866.
This was a dairy farm until 1974, but for Harvey Jr., dairy farming offered little financial reward, and he chose to concentrate on vegetables. At one point the Orts owned 166 acres, but after Jacob's death in 1972, Harvey Sr. sold much of the property to pay inheritance taxes. They still own about 75 acres but farm 500, much of it leased from other property holders. A total of 150 acres are used for vegetable growing, 200 for hay and 150 for grain.
On any given weekday, 200 to 300 people shop at the stand, and 300 to 400 on weekends, Mr. Ort said.
On Monday, many were regular customers, some of whom had been buying produce here for as long as 15 years, because, they all said, it was fresh.
"We tried all the farms and we ended up coming here," said Sefton Vergano, 22, of Bedminster, of his family's loyalty to the Ort farm stand. "The corn was great, and they also had hayrides and on Halloween you picked your own pumpkins."
Many felt a loyalty to the Ort family either because they had come to know them personally or appreciated the difficulty of making a living farming.
"We got to know everybody," said Ron Blankley, a financial services manager who lives on Schooley's Mountain. "We know the Orts; we know the people who work here; we know the folks who come and shop."
"And," said his wife, Sheryl, "we know how hard they work to keep this this kind of vocation going to produce this kind of food."
Standing in the farm stand that evening, Harvey Jr., the fifth generation in his family to farm the land, recalled how a man used to drive up to the stand in a Rolls-Royce several times a summer to buy corn for his son in Alaska.
"He was telling me it cost him, like, 30 bucks to have a dozen ears airmailed to Alaska," Mr. Ort said, "but that was the only way his son could get it fresh."
Another customer "took some to Colorado for a wedding," he said. "She actually brought 200 ears."
A S he spoke, a customer was buying 10 pounds of tomatoes that she said her father-in-law planned to take the next day to relatives in Arizona.
And Janie Hoskin recalled that several years ago their corn was the subject of a dispute between a local couple and friends "out West."
"I think it was Iowa," she said. "They said their corn was better than our corn, and this couple, as soon as we picked it, they put it on ice and sent it out to them to do a taste test. And ours was better."
The subject turned to the future of the stand, and Harvey Jr. said he had been thinking about building a bigger one a quarter-mile down Route 24, where there is more traffic, perhaps in two or three years, but it would not be one of the megastands that in his mind are too much like stores.
"If I built something," he said, "it would have to have a real farm look, not a commercial-type look."
The Orts drifted away, leaving Jody Miktus, 18, whose mother went to school with Mrs. Hoskin, to tend the stand. At closing time, Ms. Miktus, who will soon be entering the University of Scranton, put some of the perishables in coolers and then stretched a rope across the front of the open shed. The remaining tomatoes and melons could be clearly seen from the road, but this did not appear to be a problem.
The rope, she said cheerfully, is only there to show that the stand is closed. No one takes anything, she said, and if they do, they usually leave money for it.
"They'll come and get six ears," Ms. Miktus said. "And in the morning you'll find the money on the counter."
Outside, John Ort, 37, had finished feeding his animals and was heading to the farmhouse.
He seemed surprised that anyone would be surprised the stand was left open. Well, yeah, he acknowledged, someone once tampered with the register. "I think that was in the springtime," he said.
Asked why they don't put up a more secure barrier, he smiled and said, "Trustworthy, I guess."

Hot Enough for Ya?

BYLINE: By JOE SHARKEY 

 BODY:
THE bank sign near Paramus Park Mall was blinking "34," and I wondered if maybe that was the annual credit-card interest rate. But of course it was just the temperature, in Celsius, a scale used chiefly by people who work in laboratories.
It was hot, was all I knew. How hot was it? Actually, bank signs that require elaborate mathematical conversions aside, that's becoming a tough question to get a straight answer to these days. 
 "Whoa, it's 107 degrees out there," huffed a delivery man hauling a big tray of packaged doughnuts and cakes into a deli in Montclair later that same afternoon. In fact, it was not anything like 107 in Montclair. According to the paper, it was 107 in Phoenix. According to a hopelessly old-fashioned thermometer from Home Depot, in Montclair it was only 92.
Talking about the weather used to be a lot simpler in the days when we all agreed on the practical value of the traditional thermometer, which displays a precise number on a rational scientific scale. But now, along with baffling new area codes and nine-digit ZIP codes, progress has presented us with the heat index, evil offspring of the pestilential winter wind chill factor, to further muddy the waters of our common rhetoric.
Inflated relentlessly by television weather-peddlers, dutifully parroted by the poor devils assigned to write summer dog-days weather features in newspapers, bandied about everywhere the weather is discussed, the heat index is a pop meteorological product so freshly minted that it wasn't even mentioned in this newspaper until two summers ago -- and then with quotation marks around it, to indicate its quaintness.
Now, it's everywhere, to the point where it's increasingly difficult to find out what the thermometer actually reads.
Television weather forecasts "really latched onto the heat index in the past few years," said Dave Robinson, the New Jersey state climatologist, based at Rutgers University. "Now, it's all you hear on a hot day, when what you really want to know is the actual air temperature, which is at least useful. It drives me nuts when they go on about the heat index and forget to give you the temperature."
The wind chill factor, annoying as it may be to anyone simply interested in how cold it is outside, at least provides an objective measure of long it will take water to turn to ice at 32 degrees Fahrenheit (or zero Celsius) at a given wind speed.
The heat index, which was boringly known as the humiture before the television marketing geniuses pounced on it as a great new way to hype the weather, is a measure of apparent heat, a wholly subjective concept derived from a formula that takes temperature and relative humidity into account. As a chronic layman who once was actually dumb enough to write that there is nothing more boring than someone else's weather, I have carefully examined this formula. As far as I can tell, it involves subtracting 21 from the air's vapor pressure in millibars while adding the ambient air temperature and, I think, tossing in a wren's egg acquired at midnight under a new moon while performing Gregorian chant. The result is a purportedly precise number that quantifies your feelings about how hot it is outside -- and entices people to watch the television news well past the sixth antacid commercial.
"The heat index really doesn't have any scientific value," Mr. Robinson said. "It doesn't even factor in the wind." However, he does profess to find some benefit from its inexorable march into the collective cultural consciousness. "When I take off my scientific hat and look strictly at the issue of public safety, I'd argue that giving the heat index does have value in alerting people to the potential dangers" of sunstroke, he said.
In other words, broadcasting alarms of a heat index of, say, 130 and above may well save lives among those who are inclined to put on extra layers of clothing and chop firewood in mid-afternoon in an August heat wave.
Mr. Robinson said relative humidity, the weak ingredient in the heat index formula, varied too wildly all day to be useful in gauging heat discomfort. Instead, forecasts should concentrate on two fundamental numbers: the temperature and the dew point, which is the point at which dew forms in a given air mass. "Those two numbers are what you really need" to predict how uncomfortable a hot day is likely to be, he said. "But evidently, the public isn't ready to handle two variables.
"People apparently want to hear that it's 105 today," Mr. Robinson said, "even when it's really just 93."

South Windsor Getting a Piece of the Pie It Rejected

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON 

 BODY:
WHEN developers proposed a regional shopping mall for the Town of South Windsor 10 years ago, some local residents opposed the project. So it went to the next town.
The 1.18-million-square-foot Buckland Hills Mall became wildly successful: It and surrounding development now total some 6 million square feet of commercial space in neighboring Manchester. And more than 1,600 housing units are completed or planned in the area. 
 "People in the area felt that they didn't want a Buckland mall, so Manchester got the development, they got the revenues and we got the traffic," said Matthew B. Galligan, South Windsor's town manager.
But over the years the development has crept closer to South Windsor. Now I-84 Associates, which developed much of the Buckland area, has proposed Northern Hills, which would include a 14- to 16-screen movie theater, a restaurant and 30,000 square feet of retail space, the first major outgrowth into South Windsor.
"Although we still have land in Manchester, to continue the project in a large scale it seemed best to move into South Windsor," said Richard J. Ripps, a principal in the development company. Mr. Ripps said the Northern Hills project would leave 15 of its 32 acres undeveloped for now, adding that their future use had not been determined.
"It probably will be some sort of a mix -- perhaps another hotel, possibly a restaurant and maybe more retail or some spec office building," Mr. Ripps said. "I would think at least another 100,000 square feet of development of some sort would be possible. But we want to proceed at a pace where the marketplace, and the community, can comfortably digest what we develop. Things are working very well now, and we don't want to disrupt that."
In the decade since it first turned down the Buckland Hills Mall, South Windsor has adopted an ordinance to help developers pay for sewers and utilities through tax abatements, has zoned areas along Routes 5 and 84 for commercial and industrial use and it has improved the roads in those areas.
"The business climate in South Windsor has changed, there's no question about that," said Dexter S. Burnham, executive director of the South Windsor Chamber of Commerce. "Manchester is getting pretty full, so developers are going to start looking in this direction. And I think when they get here they're going to find an environment that has improved dramatically for business."
Robert E. Costa, president of Eagle Tissue, a tissue-products company at 70 Bidwell Road, said he chose to open his business in South Windsor last year because of the availability of space and the quality of life. For almost 20 years he worked in the Maspeth section of Queens in New York City.
"We had problems getting people to come to work there in the day, and we couldn't get them there at all at night because they were afraid of crime," he said. "You don't have that problem here. We're able to get a decent quality of employee here at a decent price."
Mark Pellegrini, director of planning and economic development for Manchester, said there was sufficient prospective development for both towns. "The retail created an identity for the area, an economic presence, and the area has now become a destination," Mr. Pellegrini. "We're seeing a lot more interest in entertainment businesses and restaurants. We've got some luxury apartments going up in the area, and there's an application to build a luxury hotel down there."
"It's not that commercial development bypassed South Windsor, it just hadn't gotten to them -- that's what's happening now," Mr. Pellegrini said.
Mr. Ripps noted that the Northern Hills project would require cooperation between the two towns, since it straddles the border. About 6 of the 38 acres are in Manchester.
South Windsor is slightly larger geographically than Manchester, 28.5 square miles versus 27.2 square miles, but has less than half Manchester's population of almost 53,000. Until the last several years, it has been largely an agricultural town, with extensive tobacco and dairy farms.
So when the Buckland Hills Mall went in just over the town line, there were some adjustments, particularly for traffic. The state constructed two exits off Interstate 84 to serve the shopping centers and built Interstate 291, which connects I-84 with Interstate 91.
Stephen F. Mitchell of F.A. Hesketh & Associates in Hartford, the traffic engineer for I-84 Associates, said local roads were now handling traffic well, adding that additional development would not create traffic problems.
The original mall generated about 35,000 vehicle trips a day, said Mr. Mitchell. Although the mall represented about one-fifth of the commercial space that is now in the region, the volume of traffic has just doubled, he added.
"What you see is that as development continues, particularly retail development, it's not a linear relationship," Mr. Mitchell said. "As you add more development, the number of vehicles entering the area tends to level off. People start to make more than one stop, visit more than one store. So you can continue to add development and it doesn't have as much of an impact as the first phases."
Local opposition to development has lessened over the years. Mr. Galligan said he attributed that in part to the fact that people in South Windsor work and shop just over the line, and in part to a recognition that commercial development would bring badly needed tax revenues. Moreover, South Windsor is changing as the suburban sprawl of Hartford pushes out.
"Ten years ago we were a town of 14,000 people, now we have 24,000 residents," Mr. Galligan said. "But only about 18 percent of our tax base is commercial property. We'd like to see it at 30 percent. We have an excellent school system, and if we want to maintain it we're going to need a stronger commercial tax base to support it."
Mr. Galligan said it was not just the Bucklands area where South Windsor was promoting growth. The town has zoned a 400-acre area along Route 5, about two miles away, for commercial and light industrial uses, and it has begun organizing a panel of five local business owners who would help start-up businesses negotiate leases, apply for Federal loans or maneuver through the regulatory process.
"Some people think it's all starting to happen overnight, but the town has spent the last three years making this happen, putting all the regulations in place and planning it all out," Mr. Galligan said.
MR. RIPPS said his company had obtained development permits for the Buckland Hills Mall, the Avalon Pavilions Luxury Apartments, a 932-unit rental complex, and some of the large stores in the region. He said the area was similar to Tyson's Corner in Fairfax County, Va., where mixed-use development created a place where people live, work and play. "What's happened in Bucklands, it's become so large and so prominent and so successful so quickly, it's managed to bring together that kind of critical mass," Mr. Ripps said. "There's a lot that's already happened there, and we think there's a lot more that's going to happen."
Mr. Galligan said in addition to the parcel where Northern Hills has proposed the first project, now in the final stages of the approval process, there were about 100 more acres on the east side of Buckland Hills. Across the road, he added, is a 232-acre parcel and some smaller plots.
"We still have a substantial amount of land along that corridor," Mr. Gilligan said. "We've already widened the road and put the water lines in and we're ready to go. South Windsor's at a point where it can really begin to capitalize on the development taking place in that area."

A New Report Tells Just How Preservation Pays

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
HISTORIC PRESERVATION is not just good for the eyes and heart it is good for the pocketbook," said David Listokin, a professor at the Center for Urban Policy Research of Rutgers University in New Brunswick.
He was commenting on a recently released two-year study that he co-authored with Michael Lahur, another professor at the center. 
 The 350-page report details the economic benefits, both direct and indirect, in New Jersey and nationally from such historic preservation activities as restoring and rehabilitating historic structures, heritage tourism and the operations of historic sites and organizations.
State and national advocates say the report is the first to provide the hard numbers to substantiate what they say they knew all along -- that the dollars spent on historic preservation create jobs, promote tourism, increase property values and attract new investment.
"For too long, and largely the fault of preservationists, the arguments for historic preservation have been soft, and about its 'touchy, feely' impacts," said Dovanan D. Rypkema, a real estate and economic development consultant in Washington. "But what decision-makers want to know is how much will it cost and how much will it generate in revenue."
This study, he said, will help answer those questions and remove a weak spot in the growth of preservation.
"It is a new source of ammunition for preservationists trying to leverage more room at the bargaining table, especially at a time of budget crunching," added Janice Wilson Stridick, president of the board of Preservation New Jersey, a statewide nonprofit advocacy group.
The study showed that historic preservation activities generated $580 million annually in direct economic activity in the state. Using a multiplier effect, the report says that direct benefits on an annual basis translate into, among other things, 10,140 jobs, $263 million in payroll and business earnings and $293 million in local and state taxes.
As part of those benefits, the report also says that historic properties in New Jersey, valued at $6 billion, pay $120 million in annual property taxes and have a higher market value because of their designation as historic sites. New Jersey has about 1,100 properties individually listed on the State and National Registers of Historic Places and thousands more in 240 historic districts, according to state figures.
"There are real dollars to be made in historic preservation," said Professor Listokin, noting that its "economic pump-priming effect" was greater than some alternative investments. For example, the study reports, every $1 million spent on historic rehabilitation generates 38.3 jobs, $1.3 million in payroll and business earnings and $202,000 in state taxes, compared with 36 jobs, $1.2 million in income and $189,000 in taxes from new construction projects.
The study also points out that 9.1 million tourists visit New Jersey's historic sites each year and spend $432 million. "Heritage tourism is an area that has not been fully exploited in the state," said Professor Listokin.
The $70,000 study was financed by state and Federal grants, notably from the National Center for Preservation Technology and Training of the Federal Department of the Interior, which provided $40,000. The center is making the study available to other state historic preservation organizations and a summary of its highlights to targeted groups such as urban planners and developers, said Marc R. Gilberg, research coordinator at the center.
THE report was done for the New Jersey Historic Trust, a quasi-public agency within the state's Department of Environmental Protection that awards matching grants to projects involving historic buildings owned by government agencies or nonprofit groups.
Two projects in the state that received grants from the trust in recent years underscore the economic benefits of historic preservation.
One is the Essex Club in Newark, a former gathering place for this city's business leaders. It overlooks Military Park and is not far from the New Jersey Performing Arts Center.
The $1.25 million grant awarded by the trust was used to restore and convert the 1926 Georgian Revival structure into the headquarters of the New Jersey Historical Society. The work included creating a library, museum, office and classrooms in the building.
Using the Rutgers study's model, the trust said the economic multiplier effects per $1 million of the estimated $3.8 million total construction cost of the Essex Club generated an estimated 73.4 jobs, $2.6 million in annual income and $266,000 in annual state taxes.
"This building is part of the critical mass that is aiding the economic revitalization of downtown Newark," said Maureen Ogden, president of the Historical Society. Ms. Ogden, a former State Assemblywoman who now heads the Governor's Council on the Outdoors, added that the project "could not be totally duplicated in a new building."
In nearby Jersey City's Van Vorst historic district, the Barrow Mansion, built in 1834, is a rare survivor of the city's antebellum era. A $311,375 grant from the trust was used to to restore the facade of the Greek Revival structure, as well as interior spaces. It is now used as offices by 20 community and nonprofit organizations.
Using the Rutgers study's economic multiplier effects, each $1 million of the $2.1 million cost of the project would produce on average 40.5 jobs, $1.4 million in income and $147,000 in state taxes.
"The project, which is ongoing, has been credited with spurring other restoration efforts in the neighborhood and in attracting people to live there," said Peter L. Jensen, president of the board of the Barrow Mansion Development Corporation, the nonprofit group working to preserve the building and promote its use as a community service center.
The benefits are also evident in communities where historic preservation is linked with tourism. An example is Cape May, whose tourist industry thrives on the fact that it has more than 600 historic buildings, many of them Victorians for which the city is noted. Communities also look to historic preservation to help revive their downtowns.
The New Jersey Historic Trust is the only state agency to provide funds for "bricks and mortar" preservation projects. To be eligible for a grant a building must be owned by a government agency or a nonprofit group and be listed as a state or Federal landmark or be suitable for such a listing. The trust holds easements on land under the buildings that prohibit them from being demolished and insure public access for up to 20 years.
UNDER its grant program, capitalized by $60 million set aside under 1987, 1992 and 1995 bond issues, the trust has awarded nearly $41 million in matching grants to 152 projects. It is now reviewing its last round of grants that can be financed from the bond issues.
The agency has received 109 applications for more than three times the $11.5 million in grants it has left to spend, according to Harriet C. Hawkins, its executive director.
She noted that the trust, which has a $3 million revolving fund for low-interest loans, was authorized to spend $4.5 million in administrative costs.
Meanwhile, efforts are advancing to find other ways to finance preservation projects. Ms. Ogden, chairwoman of the Governor's Council on the Outdoors, which advises the Governor on open-space and recreational issues, is recommending $15 million in financing for historic preservation.
The request, part of the $200 million package that she expects to present to the Whitman administration by year's end, also includes funds for the conservation of farmland and open space.
When the State Legislature convenes next month, it will consider a bill to provide tax credits to homeowners and businesses that rehabilitate historic properties in 100 municipalities that are classed as "distressed."
The bill would offer a gross income, or corporate, tax credit equal to 25 percent of the cost of rehabilitating a property. Among the "distressed" municipalities are Newark, Jersey City, Paterson, Camden and Trenton.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/Connecticut;
Casinos' Ripple Effect Attracts Bets on Real Estate

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON 

 BODY:
A RECENT tour of commercial property in southeastern Connecticut -- an area once known mostly for making submarines -- drew 55 real estate brokers and investors from all over the state who were looking for hotel, restaurant and golf course sites, rather than industrial properties.
The interest has been engendered by the phenomenal growth of the Foxwoods Casino in Mashantucket, the opening of the Mohegan Sun Casino last October by the Mohegan Indian tribe across the Thames River in Montville and the planned opening, pending Federal approval, of the Eastern Pequot tribe's casino in the North Stonington area. 
 Foxwoods gets more than 50,000 visitors a day; Mohegan's figures were not available.
"It's going to hit a critical mass," said Harold Kurfehs, who went on the tour. He is a Danbury realtor and president of the Commercial Investment Division of the Connecticut Realtors Association.
"That's one of the reasons there's so much interest here today," he said. "Any of the hospitality businesses are going to want to be in this area -- hotels, restaurants, bed-and-breakfasts, attractions of all sorts, are all going to add to the mix."
John C. Markowicz, executive director of the South East Area Regional Economic Development Corporation, said a strategic planning report it commissioned as the cold war ended in 1989 and 1990 had forecast a 15 percent unemployment rate and a huge loss of population in the region as Electric Boat laid off submarine builders in Groton and the Naval Undersea Warfare Center closed its offices in New London.
"That's all happened, but unemployment is below 5 percent and the population has remained stable," Mr. Markowicz said. "The only thing that's changed is that employment at the casinos has absorbed that unemployment."
Three major parcels in the region that will soon become available are generating a large number of proposals -- the 788-acre Norwich State Hospital property that straddles the Norwich, Ledyard and Preston town lines; the 28-acre former Naval Undersea Warfare Center base, which has 730,000 square feet of office space, much of it built within the last five years. and the 37-acre Seaside Regional Center on Long Island Sound, formerly run by the state's Department of Mental Retardation.
Foxwoods, which opened in 1991, has never used the locks that were initially installed on its doors because people have never stopped coming. On the three-day Memorial Day weekend this year alone more than 210,000 gamblers came, and the casino grossed $4.5 million from gaming alone, not counting its revenues from the restaurants, shops and hotels. The complex, after a $350 million expansion now under way, will comprise 3 million square feet of commercial space, including 332,000 square feet of casino space and 1,200 hotel rooms.
The Mashantucket Pequot Indian tribe, which operates Foxwoods, has also started a mail-order pharmacy and opened the Pequot River Shipworks, where it has built the high-speed trimaran ferry Sassacus, which starting this fall will carry gamblers from Manhattan to the casino. It is now marketing the boats to other operators and has announced an $11.5 million contract to build the next one for an Argentine company.
While its plans to bring a Six Flags amusement park into the area have been put on hold because of local opposition, in briefings with town leaders from the area, officers of the tribe have said they plan to build, on land outside the reservation's boundaries, at least two new hotels, two golf courses, a resort complex to be called Pequot Island and a large parking garage.
It has also submitted plans to the Federal Railroad Administration for a $100 million magnetic-levitation train that would operate initially on the reservation, but eventually connect to Norwich to the north, Interstate 95 to the south and T.F. Green Airport outside of Providence, R.I. to the east. It is negotiating with Norwich to help build a ferry dock as an additional stop for its high-speed ferry.
The tribe purchased the Norwich Inn & Spa, which it has upgraded to luxury accommodations for the casino's high- profile entertainers as well as paying guests, and it has promised to make an $18 million investment in that city's Mercantile Exchange, a city block that was once a thriving commercial center but has fallen into disrepair.
T RIBAL officials did not return calls for comment, but they have consistently declined to talk about their development plans publicly. Only recently did they start advance briefings for elected officials in the towns that will be affected.
"What they have is what appears to be a very reasoned plan for growth," said William D. Moore, president of the Southeastern Connecticut Chamber of Commerce, referring to the Mashantuckets. "I think they recognize that sooner or later the bubble of casino gaming has got to pop, so the sooner they diversify the better they will be prepared for the future. By creating a resort with golf courses, the museum, all of that will help them ride through the next downturn that occurs, whether it's a national recession or just a downturn in gaming."
Much of the investments by or related to the casinos have been concentrated in the local urban areas of New London and Norwich. Small towns in the region, which have suffered the heavy traffic and construction noises of the entertainment complex, have yet to see much benefit, their officials say.
"When Foxwoods first opened, several developers came into town, and five hotel projects were approved, but to date none of them have broken ground," said North Stonington First Selectman Charles Elias. "We have seen a couple of doughnut stores and convenience shops, but that's been about it. And one of the new convenience stores has gone into bankruptcy."
"What we're seeing is more residential development," said Ledyard Mayor Wesley Johnson. "Subdivisions that have sat empty for a few years, the developers are now beginning to pave the roads and market the lots. Most of the houses being built now are in the $130,000 or $140,000 price range, which we think are targeted at people who have worked at the casino two or three years, have developed a credit history and are ready to get out of their apartments and into a home of their own."
Preston First Selectman Robert Congdon said that in his town as well, he could not cite a single commercial development that spun off from Foxwoods. But he is hopeful
"We're going to start to see some spinoff soon, particularly if there is some kind of mass transit to tie the region together, so you can go to Mystic, and Foxwoods, and Mohegan," he said. "That's going to be a key to starting this kind of development."
Some groups don't want the spinoff, however. Madeline Jeffrey, a member of the North Stonington Citizens Land Alliance and other groups that oppose some of the development associated with the casino, said she was suspicious even of the tribe's noncasino plans.
"With the exception of the pharmaceutical company they've started, it seems to me that everything else is just a way to bring more people to the casino," Mrs. Jeffrey said. "It's great that they're creating shipbuilding jobs. But the purpose of those ships is to bring people to Connecticut's shores so they can gamble. And it's the same with the maglev trains."
Katherine L. Bishop, co-chairman of Not A Done Deal, a group that organized to battle the Six Flags proposal, said she hoped that in the future there could be discussions before a development proposal was put on the table.
"I hope the people in the region can be more proactive, that there can be ideas put forth and the towns can decide what they do want, so it isn't a battle every time something comes up," Mrs. Bishop said. "I think Six Flags was about the worst that can come down the pike. Now we need to work towards what the best can be."
Donald M. Peppard Jr., a Connecticut College economist who has tracked the casino's growth, said the point might be moot.
"I suspect there's not that much room left for gambling to grow," Dr. Peppard said. "Gaming may continue to grow faster than the rest of the economy for a little while, but I think the kind of growth we've seen in the past is just about over." He said, however, that the tribe seemed to recognize that.
"From the very beginning, they were thinking about other things to do," Dr. Peppard said. "That's one of the advantage of the tribes over Electric Boat -- Electric Boat was either unwilling or unable to diversify, while the tribe is making at least fledgling efforts to spin off some of that gaming money into efforts that could benefit the entire region."
Because of the tremendous changes in the economy, the regional economic development agency two years ago paid to have its then-five-year-old plan updated. The conclusion was the region should attempt to promote four "clusters of development" -- biotechnology, tourism, education, and high- technology manufacturing.
"I think the lessons we've learned from the 1970's and 80's is that a broadly based, diversified economy is what prevents sudden ups and downs in the region's fortunes," Mr. Markowicz said.
"We're in the position of trying to create jobs, and if there's a powerful entity out there trying to create jobs either in the clusters or in a new cluster, we're not going to oppose it," Mr. Markowicz said. "We'll take help from whatever force provides that kind of positive momentum to the economy."

HEADLINE: POSTINGS: E. 28th St. Renovation Creating 416 Apartments for Lower-Income Tenants and the Homeless;
For the Prince George Hotel, a New Life

 BODY:
The Prince George Hotel, a hulking 13-story eyesore at 14 East 28th Street with a tattered black canopy and crime-ridden past, is being refurbished as part of a $28 million project providing both living quarters and support programs.
Common Ground Community, a nonprofit housing development and management group, is turning the hotel, abandoned since 1990, into a residence with 416 efficiency apartments for the formerly homeless and for lower-income working single adults earning between $13,000 and $30,000 a year. Construction is to begin in October. 
 The project, to be completed by the fall of 1998, is being financed by the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development, the New York State Office of Mental Health, the state Department of Social Services and by low-income housing and historic tax credits.
Common Ground is modeling the project after the 652-unit Times Square at 255 West 43d Street, a former hotel it renovated and runs with its on-site social services partner, the Center for Urban Community Services.
It is also proposing to put the Prince George on the National Register of Historic Places. "It shares many of the same characteristics as the Times Square," said Roseanne Haggerty, executive director of Common Ground. "It's a landmark-quality building that has been badly misused. We look forward to renewing the property and having it be a neighborhood treasure again, while assisting those in need of housing."
The Prince George, an elaborate 1905 apartment hotel designed by Howard Greenley, was most recently the largest welfare hotel in the city.
The empty building now reminds Brian Keenan, Common Ground's on-site project manager, of a "haunted house."
"Out of five elevators, one works," he said."There's tremendous water damage." But Elizabeth Newman, project architect with Beyer Blinder Belle, said that "the building is essentially sound with some cosmetic problems."
Apartments, ranging from 250 to 300 square feet, are to have kitchenettes as well as basic furniture and a bathroom. Residents may also do their own decorating. Common rooms are to include art, computer and rehearsal spaces, as well as two landscaped roof decks.
Those leasing any of the three commercial spaces, including the ballroom, must hire at least 25 percent of their employees from those living in supportive housing in the city.

HEADLINE: Downtown Is Looking Up

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER 

 BODY:
IT was the 11th hour and the decision on the largest downtown lease in years hung in the balance. Harold McGraw 3d placed a call. He talked briefly to David G. Bronner, who runs the pension fund that owns the building, about rent.
The agreement reached in that conversation has given the slowly recovering office market in the downtown financial district a shot of adrenalin -- a 20-year lease for 15 huge floors at 55 Water Street. The occupant will be the Standard & Poor's divisions of the McGraw-Hill Companies. The owner is the New Water Street Corporation, an affiliate of the Retirement Systems of Alabama, which Dr. Bronner runs. 
 On those 62,400-square-foot floors -- the 33d through the 47th -- there is a total of 936,000 square feet of space, about the same amount of space as there is in Donald Trump's 40 Wall Street wedding-cake skyscraper a few blocks away, which rises 66 stories high.
The deal completes the leasing comeback of a nationally prominent building that was relinquished by Olympia & York Properties, the Canadian development company headed by the Reichmann family of Toronto, to its creditor-bondholders in the early 90's. The vacancy rate has gone from 40 percent to under 2 percent.
The deal also calls attention to the fact that there has been an upsurge of large space commitments downtown in recent months. These, combined with the removal of mostly obsolete space through residential conversions, have considerably tightened the market this year.
"There has been a flight to quality, which happens whenever there's been a real-estate recession," said John F. Powers, an Insignia/Edward S. Gordon Company broker who led the team that advised McGraw-Hill.
The flight so far has tended to benefit principally the newest, highest-quality buildings. The question still open is how the second tier of office buildings will fare. Many of them are from the postwar era but were completed before 1980.
Moreover, many of the moves so far are internal to downtown. Standard & Poor's, for example, will be giving up downtown about half as much space as it is leasing. Most of it is in two buildings that face each other at Bowling Green -- 337,000 square feet at 25 Broadway on the west side of Broadway, and 135,000 square feet at 26 Broadway on the east side.
Moves into downtown from midtown -- by no means improbable inasmuch as the rents for large-scale tenants are effectively about 30 percent below rents for comparable space in midtown -- would increase the net effect of leasing activity on office occupancy and employment growth.
But for now, there is mainly a feeling of pleasure and relief that 55 Water Street has been spoken for. Once that happened, in fact, Goldman Sachs & Company, which had long been considered the leading candidate to take at least part of the space that ultimately went to Standard & Poor's, agreed to lease the entire building at 10 Hanover Square, brokers report.
That 1971 property has half a million square feet of space, and its future had seemed to lie in residential conversion when Steven Witkoff, principal in the Witkoff Group, bought it vacant last year.
There have been other big deals of late: In June Merrill Lynch bought 222 Broadway, the former Western Electric Building between Ann and Fulton Streets, to house support functions forced out by business growth at its headquarters location in the World Financial Center, at Battery Park City. The seller was Swiss Bank, which is moving to Stamford, Conn.
Merrill will take over the bank's 409,000 square feet, and over time will probably occupy additional space in the 750,000-square-foot 1964 building, said Peter G. Riguardi of Colliers ABR, Merrill Lynch's real estate consultant, and use it for expansion.
"It's really a 1990's interior," said Colleen Sheridan, the Insignia/ESG broker who represented Swiss Bank. The bank put $45 million into the building in 1990, she said.
And also in June, 130 John Street came off the market with a lease that will return all its empty 490,000 square feet of space to office use. The city's Human Resources Administration took the entire building for its headquarters, leaving nine other downtown buildings. It will be renamed 180 Water Street, said Robert F. R. Ballard of Cushman & Wakefield, who represented the city in the transaction.
Seven of the 10 largest recent leasing deals have been in the so-called Financial East district on or near Water Street, brokerage reports show. With the help of such deals, the overall downtown vacancy rate in the first six months of this year declined to 15.2 percent from 20.1 percent in the first six months of last year, according to Cushman & Wakefield Research Services.
Real estate firms usually break down the inventory by classes -- A for the newest and highest quality, most of them built after 1980, B for the second tier, usually earlier postwar buildings that have not undertaken the kind of renewal program that is bringing 55 Water Street to Class A status, and Class C for older, lower-cost space. Using this categorization, Cushman & Wakefield says that the vacancy rate among Class A downtown buildings fell to 12.2 percent in the first six months this year from 15.3 percent in those months last year.
THE Class A buildings account for about 50 percent of the 108 million square feet in the downtown office inventory, as Cushman & Wakefield measures it. The vacancy rate was 18.2 percent in Class B buildings, down from 25.8 percent, and 18.9 percent in the Class C category, down from 25.8 percent, the firm says.
Some of the improvement in vacancy rates in Class B and Class C properties is the result of the withdrawal of buildings from the office leasing market as they move toward residential conversion. But the figures to date indicate that all the residential conversions completed, in construction or planned, will remove only about 3.37 million square feet of office space, or roughly 3 percent of the inventory, from office use.
Residential conversions notwithstanding, therefore, downtown's fate is linked to the success of its office buildings. The 55 Water Street saga is only the latest example of a comeback, building by building, of prime properties that took heavy blows from bankruptcies, contractions, restructuring and move-outs in the early 90's. Some buildings have been able to use the period, sometimes under changed ownership, to put themselves in position to compete for major tenants when the market improved.
An earlier example is the 400,000-square-foot 55 Broad Street, now the New York Information Technology Center, where the Rudin Organization poured $40 million into a building that was empty six years after Drexel Burnham Lambert went into bankruptcy. It is now 95 percent leased to 75 tenants, said William Rudin, all in the new-media or information technology fields.
In this building small companies can get wireless broadband access or hardwired fiber optics at the desktop, traditionally services that only large companies could afford and provide. Some tenants have already expanded, Mr. Rudin said. The company has begun to use a similar approach in another property, 110 Wall Street, a 1965 building with 300,000 square feet of space.
And still earlier, Chase Bank poured $150 million into improving public spaces and upgrading building systems at the 50-story 1968 building at One New York Plaza, with 2.1 million square feet of space. Chase, a lessee in the building, exercised its option to buy it when it was largely vacant, and then signed major leases with Prudential Securities and Goldman Sachs.
Despite the recent activity by large tenants, it is smaller tenants in the middle-tier buildings that are providing most of the current dynamism. Often these buildings are in the hands of new buyers who paid prices that permit aggressive dealmaking.
Mr. Witkoff, often making purchases with financing from Credit Suisse First Boston, has over the last two years acquired 2.5 million square feet of office buildings in the financial district alone -- 156 William Street, One Broadway, 100 Wall Street, 33 Maiden Lane and 10 Hanover Square.
Credit Suisse First Boston has financed a number of other acquisitions of its own or with developers in Manhattan over the last 15 months, taking advantage of a "window of opportunity" when prices have been favorable, said Andrew D. Stone, head of the firm's principal transaction group. The firm has put about $2 billion into New York City deals, Mr. Stone said.
The prices paid for buildings have ranged drastically -- from $10 to $125 a square foot, brokers and buyers say -- depending on such factors as current profitability and the amount of additional investment required to attract tenants. In one recent purchase at $38 a square foot, for example, Mr. Witkoff paid $18 million for the 475,000-square-foot 1969 building at 100 Wall Street, between Water and Front Streets. The owner, Hexalon, a Dutch pension fund, had bought the property in the 80's and upgraded it, increasing its value. Now Mr. Witkoff will "work the building" as corporate leases come due over the next three years. "About 160,000 feet will roll over, creating an opportunity to consolidate occupancies into contiguous spaces," Mr. Witkoff said.
Among other buildings that have transferred in the downtown shake-out are 22 Cortlandt Street, 250 Broadway, 80 Maiden Lane, 222 Broadway, 50 Broadway, 111 Broadway, 71 Murray Street, 2 Rector Street, 100 Church Street and 17 Battery Place. Darcy Stacom, the Cushman & Wakefield broker in a few of the sales, noted that motivations of the purchasers vary. "Some buyers are investors betting on the future of the office market, some are planning residential conversions, and one was to a user," she said. The user was Merrill Lynch.
At 50 Broadway, a 1927 office building a few steps north of Bowling Green, Charles Bendit, president of CBC Properties, bought a 340,000-square-foot property with partners in June from Cigna Corporation for $14.4 million when it was 65 percent occupied.
Since then about 20,000 square feet has been leased out, Mr. Bendit said. There are 45 tenants in the building, most of them in about 2,000 to 4,000 square feet, and three have renewed their leases and taken more space over the last six weeks, he said.
At 22 Cortlandt Street, Credit Suisse First Boston was the buyer last December. It is a 668,000-square-foot 1972 building between Broadway and Trinity Place that has the Century Department Store in the base but was entirely vacant in the 400,000 square feet of office space above. Norman Sterner, the general partner in Murray Hill Properties, which handles management and leasing, said 350,000 square feet had already been committed to seven tenants, three of them coming from midtown. The minimum lease size is a full floor of 17,000 square feet.
As for 55 Water Street, its saga began in the late 60's when builders were taking advantage of a widening of Water Street that the City Planning Commission initiated specifically to direct office growth in the financial district to the eastern rim of lower Manhattan. The Uris brothers -- Percy and Harold -- were the builders.
With a total of 3.6 million square feet of space, it is the second largest privately owned office building in the country, behind Sears Tower in Chicago, which has 3.8 million square feet. The building has a 53-story tower attached to a 14-story wing, with an open 40,000-square-foot plaza at the third level, reached from an open stairway between the wings and intended for public functions. The design, by the firm of Emery Roth & Sons, was strongly influenced by the city's downtown planning office.
Almost from the beginning the largest occupant has been the Chemical Bank -- now merged with Chase -- in 1.2 million square feet on the first 14 floors in both wings. The lease runs to 2003.
The vacancy rate climbed as high as 40 percent -- about 1.5 million square feet in 1993 -- with move-outs by big investment firms. Olympia & York, no longer in a position to get the financing to carry out the asbestos removal and other major improvement work necessary to attract or hold major tenants, relinquished the ownership to its bondholder-creditors. The largest one, the Retirement Systems of Alabama, bought out the other bondholders.
A key goal was to win a renewal lease in 1995 from the Depository Trust Company, a longterm tenant, said Edward J. Kulik Jr., director of the investment management division of Jones Lang Wootton U.S.A., who is in charge of leasing. Depository Trust renewed to the year 2018, taking an additional 180,000 square feet for a total of 500,000 square feet, Mr. Kulik said. In May, Chubb Insurance, currently in 100 William Street, leased 155,000 square feet on three floors.
"In the 80's we were considered a B building even though we were well-occupied, because we were being used mainly for trading and back offices," Mr. Kulik said. "So the question was do we continue on that path or do we make it an A building. The retirement system decided to spend $140 million on the base building structure and become an A building."
The future of Chase's occupancy in the building and beyond is of obvious importance. The Chase-Chemical operation uses 16 million square feet in office space and branches in the metropolitan area, and seven million square feet of pure office space in Manhattan alone, of which 4.5 million is downtown, said Cesar J. Chekijian, senior vice president of Chase Properties Group.
As a result of the merger, the bank is moving as much space as it can from midtown to downtown, where Chase formerly had its headquarters and still has a major presence. But it has also vacated two floors at 160 Water Street in a move to One New York Plaza. No further large moves are anticipated in the 90's, he said.
At McGraw-Hill, the company said that both the ratings group and the financial information services group of Standard & Poor's would move to 55 Water Street, with occupancy starting next July. If the deal had not worked out, said Mr. Powers of Insignia/ Edward S. Gordon, McGraw-Hill was prepared to build a new building in the Lefrak Organization's Newport development in Jersey City. A tax relief package from the state and city of New York, announced April 24, was critical, he said.
THE 55 Water deal will probably also assist efforts to lease up 2 Broadway, an almost vacant postwar building of 1.5 million square feet on 32 floors, acquired out of bankruptcy for $21 million in cash last year by Tom Sapir, the principal in Zar Realty. Mr. Sapir is a Russian-born investor in his 40's who made a fortune in the electronics distribution and oil export businesses, operating through a Manhattan-based company called Joy Lud International, according to Frederick Contini, his associate.
Mr. Sapir acquired and later sold 99 John Street and 80 John Street, but has kept and undertaken leasing campaigns at other acquired properties, including 260 and 261 Madison Avenue, between 38th and 39th Streets, Mr. Contini said. Two-thirds of the Zar portfolio of 5 million square feet is in lower Manhattan. Besides 2 Broadway, it includes 110-120 Church Street and 53 Park Place, Mr. Contini said. Williams Real Estate was given the leasing assignment at 2 Broadway in June. Expressing optimism, Brian Given, the broker in charge, said that as soon as Standard & Poor's signed at 55 Water Street, "we became the only building in the state of New York that can offer a million-plus square feet under one roof."
Helping these leasing efforts, all brokers say, is the apparent improvement in the financial district's physical environment as the result of the activity of the business improvement district, run by the Alliance for Downtown New York. And the residential conversions promoted by the alliance, with the help of substantial city tax incentives, have helped to lower the office vacancy rate even as it prospectively brings more round-the-clock activity to the district.
"Tenants big and small are looking," said Caleb Koeppel, the 40-year-old manager of the family-owned building at 26 Broadway, which Standard & Poor's is leaving. "We'll get a 100,000-square-foot tenant from midtown."

HEADLINE: In Vineland, a Marketplace Run by Farmers, for Farmers

BYLINE: By BILL KENT 

 BODY:
SAM RONCHETTI is still going strong. Six days a week, 35 weeks a year, Mr. Ronchetti calls the prices in his rapid-fire, singsong voice at the Vineland Produce Auction.
"I was 5 years old when my father started this auction," said Mr. Ronchetti, who will be 82 in two weeks. "I haven't missed more than two weeks in 52 years, and I'm going to keep calling until I can't do it anymore." 
 The Vineland Produce Auction is a Sotheby's for squash and as many as 70 other varieties of vegetables and produce raised in New Jersey's 8-to-10-month growing season. So influential is this nonprofit marketplace, owned and operated by farmers, that no matter where you bought your tomatoes, cucumbers, green beans, blueberries, peppers or eggplant, Vineland Produce Auction had something to do with how much you paid.
"There is no other auction of this size anywhere in the country," said Joseph Tarpine, a State Department of Agriculture market reporter based in Bridgeton. "Vineland sets the prices on produce from Canada down to Florida, in Chicago and Detroit. The buyers of tomatoes for supermarkets in Florida will find out what tomatoes sold for in Vineland and use that as the standard."
The auction also acts as a village green. Farmers from 300 farms in Burlington, Atlantic, Gloucester, Cumberland, Salem and Cape May counties gather Mondays through Saturdays, arriving sometimes before the sun comes up. They gather outside the drab shed, warm themselves over a cup of dandelion soup from nearby Tony's Luncheonette, and trade gossip and shop talk before Mr. Ronchetti begins the auction at 10:30.
"The auction itself hasn't changed," said Charles Bylone, 74, a Cumberland County farmer who as a teen-ager sold his family's eggplant at the auction. "A farmer's livelihood comes down to finding a buyer for his crop and getting a fair price for what he has to sell, and an auction is the best way that that can happen."
Founded in an abandoned gravel pit in 1931, the Vineland Produce Auction was then one of nine rural auctions in South Jersey. Vineland's auction arose "as a way of making sure the farmers got paid," Mr. Ronchetti said. "They used to have to put their produce on train cars to New York or Baltimore and take whatever price they could get on consignment, and not really have any idea of what the prices were until several days after the sale. When we started the auction, we brought the bidding and selling up to where we could keep an eye on it."
Other auctions have either closed or changed to non-bidding, direct sales operations negotiated by telephone and fax, but Vineland persists with in-person voice bidding on produce samples that buyers can inspect, smell and taste before haggling over the price. Once the sample is sold, the auction levies a 4 percent fee to cover its operating costs. The buyer sends a truck to the farm to get the rest of the lot.
Complex factors of weather, transportation costs, supply and demand mean prices can fluctuate wildly from $2 to $12 a box or bushel. Daymon W. Thatch, a Rutgers University professor of agricultural economics and marketing who has studied the auction, said these fluctuations "can drive the major chain buyers, your supermarkets and major distributors up the walls."
"The function of the auction is to keep the buying process honest and out in the open, and diffuse the risk over the greatest possible number," Mr. Thatch said. "This wasn't so much a problem 50 years ago when the markets were smaller --individual produce stands, mom-and-pop grocery stores, packers and canning companies. But a chain market like an Acme or a Pathmark is going to want a fixed price on green beans or tomatoes for several weeks so they can determine a price and run a sale, and not be beaten somebody else buying the same produce at a lower price."
To get this fixed price, more buyers are bypassing the auction block to negotiate with individual farmers, sometimes before the crop is ready for harvest. The Vineland Produce Auction also negotiates direct sales. Last year, two-thirds of the $50 million in wholesale produce that moved through the auction were direct sales.
Although live bidding remains strong, Mr. Bylone, a former president of the auction and still a board member, fears that its days might be numbered. "From the beginning, there's been pressure on us to change our ways," he said, "to make things easier or more efficient or cheaper. We've lost some farmers over the years for a lot of reasons, most of them having to do with land costs and development. I think we'd lose a lot more if we gave up the auction."
But Mr. Ronchetti said he wasn't worried. "As long as people want to see where the money comes from and where it goes," he said, "I'll have a job."

HEADLINE: BEHIND THE WHEEL/1998 Subaru Forester;
A Car for Town and Backcountry

BYLINE: By MICHELLE KREBS 

DATELINE: DETROIT

 BODY:
BY children constantly stump me with questions. For instance, as we assembled s'mores recently, my daughter left me cold when she asked how marshmallows were made.
My 5-year-old son socked me with another one as he climbed out of the 1998 Subaru Forester. "Is this a car or a truck?" he asked. (He obviously hadn't read Subaru's press materials -- he can't read, period -- which stressed that the Forester begs the question, "Is it a car or is it a truck?") 
 He went on to say that the Forester felt like a car when he got in and out because it sat low to the ground. But with its white body and black luggage rack, it resembled his baby-sitter's Ford Explorer, a truck that has the same color scheme. Still, he decided, the Forester was too small to be a truck. "I guess it's a car-truck," he concluded with as much satisfaction as if he had solved the riddle of the Sphinx.
Indeed, the Forester, like many of the newest utility vehicles, defies precise categorization.
With more than two million sport-utility vehicles sold last year and continued growth predicted into the next century, auto makers are scrambling to fill market niches and to create new niches in the segment. Among the companies hoping to create another winning formula is Subaru, which has thrived with the introduction of rugged-looking, all-wheel-drive Outback versions of its Legacy and Impreza cars.
The Forester is Subaru's latest small car-truck hybrid. Like its prime competitors, the Toyota RAV4 and the Honda CR-V, the Forester combines the ride, handling and comfort of a sedan with the outdoorsy appearance, practicality and off-road capability of a sport utility. And in many ways, the Forester outperforms the entries from Toyota and Honda.
The Forester is classified by the Environmental Protection Agency as a small station wagon -- that is, as a car. It is equipped with dual front air bags, side impact beams and bumpers that meet the Federal Government's more stringent requirements for cars.
Indeed, the Forester is derived from the compact Subaru Impreza. Longer and taller than the RAV4 and close in exterior size to the CR-V, the Forester has a more head-to-the-woods appearance than the oh-so-cute RAV4 or the uncluttered, box-shaped CR-V. With its macho grille, square head lamps, ground-hugging stance, mud flaps and "AWD" badges, the five-passenger Forester looks ready for serious off-roading.
Inside, however, the Forester is undoubtedly a car. Its low profile makes entry and exit easy. From behind the wheel, there is good visibility -- thanks to large expanses of glass, narrow roof pillars and a low hood line. The view out the rear window is good, too: unlike the RAV4 and CR-V, which have the spare tire mounted to the back door, the Forester stows its full-size spare beneath the floor of the cargo area.
The Forester's seating positions are car-like as well, except that the roomy cabin provides more headroom than most small cars. The front buckets proved comfortable, once I figured out how to use the two unconventional rotating controls that tilt the seat and adjust the lumbar support. The rear seat is a three-person bench, with shoulder-lap safety belts for the outer passengers and a lap belt in the center. The rear seat can be partly folded or entirely folded for maximum cargo space.
The instrument panel, which includes a large analog speedometer and tachometer, is similar to that of a traditional sedan. Only the optional and rather gimmicky gauge package for the center of the dash, which includes an elaborate compass, thermometer, altimeter and barometer, suggests that this Subaru could be used for cross-country rally racing.
Largely aimed at young buyers, the Forester emphasizes good vibes. An 80-watt stereo radio and cassette player with four door-mounted speakers is standard. A CD player can be added as an option without sacrificing the cassette. But the system's ergonomics need improvement. The teeny buttons are better suited to my children's fingers than to my own.
The cup holders could also use some attention. One pulls out from the dash directly in front of the heating and air-conditioning vent; a second is oddly placed inside the center console, while another pair is available to back-seat passengers.
Nice touches are the 12-volt outlets for lighters, cellular phones, computers or air compressors. There is one outlet in the front and another in the cargo bay.
Storage is bountiful. When not being used for the cup holder, the center console offers a storage box. Mounted in the ceiling is an overhead console with map lights, a digital clock and a built-in case for glasses. The doors have map pockets and storage bins in the armrests. Some Forester models have storage nets on the seat backs.
At 33.2 cubic feet, the cargo bay beats the CR-V and RAV4. Accessible by the rear lift gate, which opens upward, the cargo area sits low for easy loading and unloading. It easily accommodated sleeping bags, camping gear and backpacks for the three Girl Scouts I delivered to camp. Fold the rear seats down, and the cargo capacity doubles.
If that's not enough, there is always the roof rack. The short stature of the Forester makes the rack practical for carrying bicycles, canoes and skies.
The Forester is loaded with standard features, including power steering, windows, seats and locks, all-wheel drive, anti-lock brakes (on the L and S versions, but not available at all on the base model), air-conditioning, cruise control, tilt steering and rear defroster and wiper.
Living up to its billing, the Forester offers carlike ride and handling. It uses a 2.5-liter "boxer" engine, which is positioned horizontally under the hood; the same engine is used in the Legacy Outback and 2.5 GT and the Impreza 2.5 RS. The engine's design gives the Forester a lower center of gravity and shorter length for good stability.
The Forester also has best-in-class power. Rated at 165 horsepower, the four-cylinder engine rivals some sixes and compares favorably with the RAV4 and CR-V, which have less than 130 horsepower. Torque, at 162 foot-pounds, is significantly higher than its two competitors', aiding in getaways from a dead stop.
The Forester comes with a five-speed manual or a four-speed automatic transmission; the tested model had the automatic, which shifted quite smoothly.
Despite higher power, and thanks to Subaru's lightweight all-wheel-drive system, the Forester still gets good fuel economy.
The Forester also has an advantage in handling. It conquered winding roads and tight corners with plenty of grip and agility. Braking is not only carlike, but similar to that of a sports car. According to testing conducted by Car and Driver magazine, the Forester's braking approaches that of the Porsche 911.
Plus, the Forester offers added confidence in winter driving. Its all-wheel-drive system constantly varies torque between the front and rear wheels for better traction. The system, the vehicle's ground clearance and the angles at which it can climb and descend hills make it possible to take the Forester off road. My only macho experience, however, was on the winding dirt road leading to the scouts' wooded campsite.
The Forester's ride was quiet and car-like, too. While not as silent as a Lexus, the Forester is far less noisy than the raucous RAV4 and the deafening CR-V.
Despite their shortcomings, the RAV4 and CR-V have been successful in the market. The Forester, with its quiet ride, carlike handling, roomy cabin, cargo capacity and long list of standard features, will likely follow suit, especially with its competitive pricing of $19,000 to $24,000.
And Forester buyers won't care if it is a car or a truck.

Widgets for Credits in a Cashless Marketplace

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
ANTHONY DeGANO, who owns a photography studio in Belmar, N.J., has photographed weddings and family portraits for clients and traded his work for, among other things, a diamond for his wife and electrical work for his business.
Robert Cook, who owns a commercial printing company in San Francisco, has printed color brochures for customers and swapped his products for items including office equipment for his company and a patch of land on Hawaii for himself. 
 In these transactions, Mr. DeGano and Mr. Cook have used barter dollars, earned from the barter exchanges of which they are members. Such groups, for membership and transaction fees, act as matchmakers of sorts, bringing together an increasing number of owners of small and midsize businesses to barter their goods and services.
Bartering is nothing new. But in the last few years, more sophisticated and computer-savvy barter exchanges have been able to add and improve links among barterers to deliver more goods and services. And while some informal barter still exists elsewhere, all the new barter companies have formal requirements on reporting to the Internal Revenue Service. This has helped dispel some of barter's shady image and has given a new tool to businesses seeking to use barter to conserve cash and find new customers beyond their usual trade areas.
When members sell their goods and services, at retail prices, through an exchange, they earn trade dollars that are credited to their account and can be used to buy from other members. Exchanges get their revenue through membership fees, generally $300 to $600, and from commissions, which tend to be 10 to 15 percent for each transaction.
Like the rest of corporate America, the world of barter is undergoing consolidations and mergers, resulting in new regional, national and international exchanges. One exchange has gone public and another plans to do so; an exchange's assets, like those of a stock brokerage firm, are the commissions it makes on trade transactions. And some exchanges have formed alliances, fostering trading among themselves.
Last year, 686 local, regional, national and international barter groups serving 408,000 clients conducted transactions valued at $9.1 billion in the United States and Canada, up from $8.4 billion in 1995 and $5.3 billion in 1990, according to the latest estimates from the International Reciprocal Trade Association in Chicago, one of two large barter trade groups. The current total is one-thousandth of 1 percent of the gross national product, said Robert Meyer, the publisher of Barter News in Mission Viejo, Calif.
Steven M. White, president-elect of the National Association of Trade Exchanges in Euclid, Ohio, the second big American barter trade group, said, "Bigger is better because consumers are demanding more choices and services." To further that goal, Mr. White said, his association set up a cooperative last month that any of its 110 members can join, for a fee of $50 a month and one-quarter of 1 percent of the value of any transaction. The cooperative is a kind of bank for barter dollars and transactions that can be traded by members across the nation through a computerized system -- effectively allowing small, local groups to increase their reach to match the scope of bigger exchanges, Mr. White said.
So far, 60 of the association's members have joined, enabling "each exchange to secure the other's trade dollars," said Mr. White, who is also president of the International Barter Corporation, a 1,000-member exchange in Seattle. He said that International Barter was going public and that his goal was to raise $1 million by the end of the year to expand his company by acquiring others.
The International Reciprocal Trade Association is also working on a "universal currency" system for its 180 members, said Steven Goldbloom, its president, and a principal of two barter exchanges, one corporate and one retail, in San Francisco.
Proponents of bartering say businesses that barter can profit by increasing purchasing power and attracting new customers. For example, a widget maker who spends 35 cents on making a widget barters it at its full price, say $1, and receives back $1 in goods or services from barter companions, minus the commission. Or a barterer in New Jersey may be able to find a new customer in Hawaii through a barter exchange, expanding her trade area.
While some exchanges have formed alliances, others have joined forces with their corporate barter counterparts. Those counterparts buy surplus from large companies to sell to secondary and overseas markets. The alliances give the corporate barter groups another distribution system and the smaller businesses get more products to trade for.
Bartering does not benefit all companies, however, particularly those that work on profit margins of 25 percent or less, Mr. Meyer said. Moreover, a trade dollar is like an i.o.u., so members must depend on their exchange's ability to fulfill it, and desired goods may not always be available.
Businesses should not use bartering unless they spend the trade dollars, Mr. Meyer said. Unspent trade dollars create cash-flow problems and tax-liability issues because credits are taxed as income when they are received, he said.
Bartering went through a shakeout in the late 1980's and early 1990's, and many of the barter groups that lacked experience and capital closed, Mr. Meyer said. Once perceived as part of the underground economy -- a way to avoid paying taxes -- bartering also gained credibility with the passage of the tax act in 1983. It required barter exchanges, for the first time, to report to the Internal Revenue Service the value of transactions, which are subject to the same tax treatment as cash transactions. (Transactions by individuals who barter outside a formal exchange are also subject to the tax treatment of cash transactions.)
But the image of barter as a sometimes questionable practice is still vivid in some minds, in part because of highly publicized cases like one last year in which the artist Peter Max was indicted on charges that he bartered paintings as partial payment for three homes and failed to declare the sale of those paintings on his income tax return. The trial is set to begin on Oct. 1 in United States District Court in Manhattan.
The Itex Corporation of Portland, Ore., the barter exchange that started publicly trading its stock in 1992, has also been making the news. Among the nation's largest exchanges, with 14,000 clients and 124 broker offices across the country as well as 20 foreign offices, Itex has been involved in a lawsuit and has been under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission for more than a year.
Itex won the suit, in which it accused a rival company, BXI Inc., of breach of contract after its attempted takeover of that company went awry, but BXI is appealing the decision. The S.E.C.'s investigation about certain of Itex's accounting policies and business transactions continues.
The company's stock, which in January 1996 traded as high as $12.50 a share, has plunged to around $3.
DESPITE these troubles, barter transactions continue to grow. Bartering is a way to conserve cash, and "businesses can never have enough cash," said Chris C. Christensen, who runs C. N. Barter Inc. in Belmar, N.J., a part of Itex.
He gets no argument from Mr. DeGano, the photo studio owner, who has been a member of C. N. Barter for nine years. Bartering, he said, is a way to increase his working capital and fill slow periods. "Rather than sitting idle, I can barter my services," said Mr. DeGano, adding, "a deal is a deal."
Of course, bartering is no substitute for cash when it comes to paying bills, but barterers can still be creative.
Susan Groenwald, president of the Barter Corporation, which is based in Chicago, tells of an owner of a bicycle and silk-screening shop who bartered enough bicycles and T-shirts to to earn trade dollars that he used for an expanded plant for his business.
And Mr. Cook, the San Francisco printer, who has been bartering for the 13 years he has been in business, says he even used trade dollars to buy out two partners. "It is not a magic black box and you have to be smart about using it," he said. "But I wonder how you can run a small business without it."

The Cosmopolitan Touch

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
Mutual fund investors in the United States are moving more money abroad, according to a recent survey by the Gallup Organization for Scudder, Stevens & Clark, which sponsors many funds that invest internationally.
The number of American households that invest overseas through funds has risen almost 18 percent since 1994, to 6.7 million, according to the survey. The number that invest solely in funds that stick to American markets has declined 11 percent in the same period. 
 And more investors are planning to send some money overseas soon. Nearly 20 percent of investors who did not own an international fund said they intended to buy one in the next 12 months. These people were particularly interested in broadly diversified funds that could invest anywhere in the world, the survey found.
Nonetheless, some investors remained leery about leaving home, at least in their mutual-fund investments. Though some of these investors cited concerns about political volatility and currency fluctuations, still more stressed their preference for supporting American companies as well as a lack of knowledge about foreign investment. A larger proportion of domestic investors -- 16 percent versus 9 percent last year -- said they would avoid foreign investing.
The survey, conducted annually in late March and early April, is based on 1,000 telephone interviews with heads of households that own mutual funds.
Scudder has recently been on the receiving end of some international investing; last month, Zurich Group, Switzerland's largest insurance company, agreed to buy the American fund company for $1.7 billion.
 
Retirement Planning
T. Rowe Price Associates has a new version of its financial-planning software for people thinking about retirement (as well as for those who have already retired). It allows couples to calculate their needs using a different retirement date for each spouse, and has a new -- and, the company says, more accurate -- calculation of the income tax rates that retirees are likely to pay, which can have a big effect on how much money they need to live comfortably.
The software requires an I.B.M.-compatible PC with Windows 3.1 or higher. It is available on compact disk or 3.5-inch diskette for $19.95, and can be ordered by calling (800) 541-5760.
 
Exchange Privileges
Investors in Van Kampen American Capital funds will be able to exchange their shares for shares in Morgan Stanley funds starting tomorrow. Morgan Stanley bought Van Kampen last year. The firm has ended a separate program under which investors in the funds of other companies could move their money into Van Kampen's offerings without paying a sales charge.
 
New Managers
Eric Miller, a research analyst and money manager with Heartland Advisors, has joined William Nasgovitz as co-manager of Heartland Value.
David Rosenberg, lead manager of Oppenheimer Limited-Term Government Bond and Oppenheimer U.S. Government Trust, resigned because of ill health. Jerry Webman, director of Oppenheimer's tax-exempt fixed-income investments group, will run the funds until the company picks a new manager.
Douglas D. Ramos, formerly lead manager of New England Balanced, has joined the Dreyfus Corporation. He takes over Dreyfus Balanced from Timothy Ghriskey, and Dreyfus Growth and Income, Dreyfus Premier Growth and Income and the Dreyfus Variable Investment Growth and Income Portfolio from Richard Hoey.

HEADLINE: INVESTING WITH: Judith Vale;
Neuberger & Berman Genesis Fund

BYLINE: By ANNE TERGESEN 

 BODY:
JUDITH VALE began her career at Radio Free Europe in the 1970's, critiquing Russian-language news reports that were beamed into the Soviet Union. Then she moved to the Greek isle of Hydra, ostensibly painting portraits but mostly swimming, she said. Today, she is a self-taught money manager who specializes in the stocks of small companies, which she describes with unusual verve.
But if Ms. Vale is colorful -- at least for the navy blue world of portfolio managers -- the mutual fund she manages, Neuberger & Berman Genesis, is not. And its dullness, she said, is part of the secret of its success. 
 In the three years she has run the fund, Ms. Vale has eschewed glamorous but risky high-fliers for sensible, humdrum, even boring companies, as she is fond of saying. Her aim is to compile a portfolio that avoids the sharp peaks and valleys characteristic of small stocks -- those that the market values at $1 billion or less.
The portfolio's companies "will put you to sleep -- but we think this is great," Ms. Vale said from her office overlooking lower Manhattan. "We don't want managers that glitter too much and have too much pizazz."
Pizazz is certainly not a problem for the 125 stocks in the $855 million fund; many are companies that basically make parts for other companies' products. The fund's biggest investments are in aerospace and energy, and it owns a smattering of smallish banks.
The strategy seems to be working. In the three years since Ms. Vale took command of the fund, the returns of Genesis have averaged 20.3 percent, exceeding the average of all domestic equity funds by 4 percentage points and the average small-capitalization fund by 6.5 percentage points, according to Morningstar Inc., the fund trackers.
Ms. Vale calls her staid investment approach "common sense," though at first glance it may seem at odds with her nontraditional path to Wall Street. A Russian literature major at Yale who never took an economics course, Ms. Vale said she settled on investing in part because everything else she explored "sounded pretty dreadful."
She got her first chance at a tiny investment partnership, where she typed and answered phones for three months before publishing her first research report -- and snaring a client. She later worked at several money management firms, including Atalanta Sosnoff Capital, Merrill Lynch Asset Management and Quest Advisory, which is run by the small-company investor Charles M. Royce.
In championing unexciting but predictable performers and looking for relatively inexpensive stocks, Ms. Vale, 44, is bucking the prevailing wisdom among many small-cap managers, who tend to prefer fast-growing concerns and typically own large blocks of technology and other stocks prone to earnings surprises, both positive and negative. The average domestic small-cap fund invested about 18 percent of its assets in technology stocks as of June 30, according to Morningstar, but the figure for Genesis is now about 10 percent, Ms. Vale said.
"Some people think it's sort of an inside-out way of managing money, but we look at the risk in a holding before we look at a return," she said. "I think a significant portion of our outperformance over the last couple of years has come from simply having far fewer blow-ups than other small-cap managers."
To minimize risk, Genesis follows a few guidelines. First, it looks for companies that have usually posted annual earnings increases of 15 to 18 percent for several years. Such steady returns are "a lot more sustainable," Ms. Vale said, than the high-octane performances that receive much attention.
The fund also looks for companies whose stocks are cheap simply because they have been overlooked, not because they are financially frail. Ms. Vale seeks companies that generate excess cash they can use to finance expansion either internally or by acquisitions or to repurchase stock to increase earnings per share. She also focuses on a company's return on assets, which helps weed out companies with a lot of debt. And she likes to meet with the company's executives to get an idea of their management skills.
Right now, Ms. Vale is keen on stocks in two areas, energy and commercial aerospace, which are experiencing rising demand for their products. In the case of energy, a protracted period of underinvestment has left drilling capacity tight while technological advances have lowered exploration and drilling costs, she said. In aviation, the companies that remain after the recent spate of consolidation should see sustained demand, she said, because Federal regulations are prompting airlines to replace their aging fleets.
Though these industries are generally sensitive to the economic environment, companies in both sectors enjoy the ability to raise prices -- a rarity that should help insure profit growth and protect Genesis shareholders from any economic slowdown, she said.
Ms. Vale is a patient investor. Accordingly, the percentage of the portfolio that changed last year -- its turnover -- was 21 percent, versus 93 percent for the average small-cap fund, according to Morningstar.
This placid style seems a world away from the adventures of her earlier life, but Ms. Vale does not see it that way. "Quite frankly, I view this job probably as a middle-aged version of the same thing," she said. "I am never bored."
 
A Choice in Energy
In energy, one of Ms. Vale's favorites is National-Oilwell Inc. of Houston, which recently bought another of the fund's top holdings, Dreco Energy Services of Edmonton, Alberta. A large maker of equipment for oil rigs, National-Oilwell is poised to benefit from rising energy demand that has recently encouraged oil service and drilling companies to build new rigs, Ms. Vale said.
"Clearly, there is going to be dramatic earnings growth ahead," she said, which justifies the recent doubling this year of National-Oilwell's stock price. (It now trades for more than $61 a share.)
 
Parts for Aircraft
The fund's largest holding is Thiokol, the Ogden, Utah-based maker of parts for commercial aircraft. Ms. Vale said she would not be surprised if rising revenues and profit margins helped push the company's stock from today's price of just under $74 to $100 a share within 18 months. That would be $58 more than the average price that Genesis paid for the stock.
Most analysts expect Thiokol's earnings for the year ending next June to be about $4.50 a share. But Ms. Vale says that estimate is too low. Given the company's solid management and the industry's strong fundamentals, she said, $5 or above is more likely.
 
A Distributor's Potential
Another favorite is Aviall Inc. of Dallas, a big independent distributor of new airplane parts. As the industry consolidates, Aviall is poised to remain a leader, Ms. Vale asserted, in part because it can generate much cash to buy back shares or to make acquisitions. She predicts that, with sales rising and management containing costs, earnings should rise 20 percent next year.
A stock price of $20 is "an easy shot" within 18 months, she added. Aviall now trades for $15 -- about 12 times next year's projected earnings a share -- making it "very inexpensive," she said.

HEADLINE: MAKING IT WORK;
The Never-Ending March of Lawyers

BYLINE: By BERNARD STAMLER 

 BODY:
TIGHT-LIPPED and anxious, they marched en masse to the Javits Center last week, pens and pencils clutched in nervous hands. After three years of law school, two months of cram courses and countless sleepless nights, this, at last, was it: the New York State Bar Examination. For 5,000 aspiring New York lawyers, it was time to do or die.
The test-takers in Manhattan were among nearly 9,000 statewide, the biggest group ever, according to Nancy Carpenter, executive secretary of the State Board of Law Examiners. 
 The number of hopefuls taking the two-day summer exam and its February counterpart has been rising for some time, she said, with each year bringing another record number of applicants seeking entry into the legal profession.
Yet it is a profession that has seen better days, to be sure.
As lawyers themselves love to say, the evidence is overwhelming. Scorned by the citizenry (a Consumer Reports survey last year found that only diet clinics were held in lower esteem by their patrons), lawyers are nearly four times as likely to be depressed than average Americans, according to The Legal Intelligencer, a trade publication.
Partnership opportunities at big firms are down, and working hours are up, The National Law Journal says, and polls taken by various bar groups show that record numbers of lawyers would do something else if given the choice.
The situation is so bleak that legal experts participating in an on-line forum held this year by Counsel Connect, a service for lawyers, echoed the sentiments of Kathleen Munden, a Texas lawyer, who said that once students graduated from law school, the majority "will be left with an enormous student loan, no job and no practical knowledge about how to practice law."
But such pessimism seems not to dim the ardor of most graduates, 75 percent of whom usually pass the July exam. Cognizant of the pessimism surrounding their future profession, many are anxious nonetheless to go out and give it a try. Whether it is the prospect of the money they think they will earn that motivates them, or the bravado of those who have not yet known failure in their young lives, they believe they can transcend the problems.
Erica Fine, editorial director of the New York office of BAR/BRI, the nation's foremost cram course, is not so sure. She voices worry that some of the 6,300, mostly 20-something students taking her company's New York summer course are overly coddled by their families and are unrealistic.
Like the other members of BAR/BRI's New York management staff, she is a lawyer who does not practice ("I hated it," she says of her four-year stint in a small firm), and believes she was poorly prepared for the rigors of the profession when she graduated from law school in the early 1980's.
Today, she said, the problem is worse; her students "are needier now than ever before."
"They live with mom and dad longer, and expect that things are going to be done for them," said Ms. Fine.
Her job includes handling the phone calls of students who have problems or need additional tutoring. She says that more parents call her every year with questions that their adult children should be asking directly, but don't, as if they were too busy to pick up a phone.
Still, she said, the majority of cram course participants are neither deluded about their prospects, nor too lazy to care about the problems they face.
Basheva Genut, for example, a 24-year-old Fordham graduate from Manhattan, has already chosen not to seek legal employment. She'll be working at a nonprofit policy research institute. While she is taking the bar exam to complete her legal education, she says she views her legal credentials simply as "something good to have."
Sharon Dutch, 25, of Brooklyn, agrees. She concedes readily that she went to law school not out of some burning need to pursue justice but because she "wasn't ready not to be a student."
But after graduating from college, she managed to find interesting part-time work with a small law firm while attending Brooklyn Law School, and already has a job awaiting her at summer's end.
"I feel that law school provided me with a trade," she said.
Optimistic about her own future, she is nevertheless aware that plenty of lawyers for whom the law is "just a paycheck" are stuck in terrible jobs.
That's just what Richard Davies, 24, is determined to avoid. Having turned down a job in Los Angeles, where he attended school, he returned home to New York City confident of landing a position with a good firm.
He dismisses the widely held cynicism about lawyers as "jealousy and economic envy."
"I went to law school because most people I admired had law degrees," he said. "That hasn't changed."

"For This You Cram"
This question is excerpted from the February 1997 bar exam:
 
Hal and Win, after five years of marriage, agreed to separate. As long-time friends of yours, they have asked you to prepare a separation agreement. They have not consulted or retained other counsel. Hal and Win have agreed on most of the terms to be embodied in the separation agreement, including maintenance payable to Win. They have agreed that Win is to have custody of their only child, Peg, age 4, but they have not been able to agree on the amount of child support
 
(A) Can you represent both of them in preparing the separation agreement without jeopardizing the validity of the agreement?
 
(B) How should the appropriate amount of child support for Peg be determined?
 
ANSWERS:
(A) You could represent both if you divulge the possible conflict of interest.
 
(B) Child support should be calculated based on the Uniform Child Support Act.

HEADLINE: OFF THE SHELF;
Free-Market Fallout. For This We Won the Cold War?

BYLINE: By DEBORAH STEAD 

 BODY:
WRITING about a new CD-ROM from Microsoft, a software reviewer recently noted, in a by-the-way tone, that the games on the disk were mostly developed in Russia under Alexey Pajitnov, the creator of the popular game Tetris. (He now works for Microsoft.)
In these post-cold war days, such arrangements are common enough to warrant only a ho-hum. But in the view of William Wolman and Anne Colamosca, authors of "The Judas Economy: The Triumph of Capital and the Betrayal of Work" (Addison-Wesley, $25), they add up to a kind of free-market fallout. It is a current, they say, that increasingly controls the direction of developed economies, especially our own. 
 "Understanding the impact of the cold-war victory on the United States is the key to understanding every major economic trend now in operation in the United States," the authors say.
It's an intriguing premise. And even if that key doesn't always fit, "The Judas Economy" is nonetheless persuasive as it argues that an unfettered free market has its tyrannies, too.
Since capitalism prevailed over Communism in the late 1980's, the authors contend, globalization has stepped up. Increasingly, corporations have been hiring the best and brightest in freshly pro-market countries like China, the former Soviet bloc and India, which abandoned its Soviet-model economy in 1991. The ranks of such workers are huge. Eager and prepared, thanks in part to socialist-style free education, these employees can be snapped up for a fraction of the cost of their American counterparts, the authors say.
The effects are "barely being felt now" by mid-level American workers, the authors say, but "it will get worse" as companies start to farm out engineering, architecture, banking and medical projects via E-mail.
In other ways, too, they argue, the post-cold war economy is a chilling place for Americans who rely on work, not capital, to support themselves. As capital roams the globe, putting more of its resources at the disposal of the newly available "knowledge"' workers, health and retirement benefits for domestic employees are dwindling. And with laissez-faire ideology riding high and even mild state intervention out of favor, Government isn't picking up much of the slack. "The market is now God; economic planning is the Devil incarnate," the authors lament.
"The Judas Economy" delivers a caveat about succumbing to such free-market triumphalism. Among the perils, the authors warn, is the specter of recession, along with a wider gap between rich and poor.
Mr. Wolman, chief economist at Business Week (where this writer was once a distant colleague of his), and Ms. Colamosca, a free-lance business journalist, know they are swimming against a tide -- a gush, really -- of optimism and pride. The economy's numbers are terrific these days: unemployment is low, inflation mellow, corporate profits healthy, the stock market snorting and pawing.
But with some lapses, "The Judas Economy" uses its post-cold war premise and those same statistics to challenge this bullishness.
The Fed's anti-inflation "hysteria," the authors say, only keeps growth dangerously slow. Anyway, its real purpose is to protect the value of loans for creditors (the owners of capital), not debtors (workers with high consumer debt and mortgages). And while more people may be working, inflation-adjusted wages are stagnating. Corporate profits are sturdy as Wall Street rewards downsizing and other cutbacks, but people are cheering for the stock market "at their own expense."
"The Judas Economy" doesn't always succeed in linking these traditionally liberal arguments to its premise about the new post-Communist global labor market. And in any case, it may be overstating that premise.
The authors never demonstrate, for example, that on-site employees have been replacing the Western engineers and executives usually sent abroad on projects. Although a chapter on Bangalore, India -- where legions work for American computer companies -- gives us a fascinating glimpse of the brainpower at Western capital's disposal, the book largely ignores the problems that keep many investors out of some newly pro-market regions: tangled bureaucracies, ingrained corruption, outdated infrastructures. For a slightly more pessimistic view of India's chances of attracting investment, for example, read Shashi Tharoor's "India: From Midnight to the Millennium" (Arcade Publishing, $27.95).
Over all, however, the book offers some compelling arguments, including a view that more Federal aid to university researchers will help American workers keep their creative edge. At times, its warnings are even entertaining. Calling re-engineering "a sick joke" for employees, the authors somewhat outrageously compare it to Mao's Cultural Revolution. And a discussion of the Fed's failures includes a terrific footnote on the hidden economic messages in "The Wizard of Oz."
 
BUTTON UP YOUR OVERCOAT Remember "Dress for Success"? Pick up a copy at a summer tag sale, as I did, and you'll get a quick glimpse of corporate culture 20 years ago. The book, by John T. Molloy, instructed a generation of white-collar workers that "conservative, class-conscious conformity" in clothes is "absolutely essential to success." That meant blue, gray and beige suits -- and beige (only!) raincoats. Black raincoats, then favored by the "lower middle class," were seen as a ticket back to the mail room.
Has this changed? Yes, according to the latest primer, "Work Clothes: Casual Dress for Serious Work," by J. Scott Omelianuk, the latest in the Chic Simple life-style series (Knopf, $23).
And no.
It's unquestionably hipper, and this guide to prevailing during the "casualization of America" is more about deconstruction than directives. It also applies the language of re-engineering -- "audit," "dejunk," "reinvest" -- to work wardrobes. Still, it primly advises that "a quality timepiece sends a signal of authority." And among the photos is that reliable trench coat -- in beige.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
With Rates Down, Will Investors Sell?

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
Where is Bob Dole when we need him?
Just a year ago Mr. Dole was promising legislation to let you file your tax return on a postcard. But he lost, and President Clinton and the Congressional Republicans have given us a law that only an accountant working by the hour could love. 
 The bill was so complicated that it was not until details were announced that someone realized it would actually raise capital gains taxes on many transactions. After some scrambling, that was fixed by making the law even more complex. Now there will be three capital gains holding periods, with different rates. No one knows how much it will cost mutual fund companies to change their computer programs and forms to keep track of all of that.
If Congress thought the Government was taking in too much money, it could have just cut tax rates a bit. But that is not how the politicians like it. So now you can look at your own family circumstances and see whether or not Washington approves of you.
The most despised people in America are smokers who fly a lot, have high incomes and little in the way of investments -- or at least little in the way of successful investments other than their homes. They don't get the benefit of lower capital gains taxes, since they don't have capital gains. Neither do they get any benefits from new individual retirement accounts or child credits or higher education credits. All of them have income limits. Taxes on cigarettes and plane flights are going up. And some people with expensive homes who formerly did not have to pay taxes when they moved now will owe money.
For investors, the most important part of the bill is, of course, the capital gains cut. Now, if you have owned a stock for 18 months and a day, you can sell and pay a tax of just 20 percent on your profits. The old rate of 28 percent applies on investments of one year and a day to 18 months. And you still pay rates of up to 39.6 percent, if you sell a year or less after buying.
An important question for market seers is to what extent the new rules will stimulate selling. (Washington assumes they will; this tax break is supposed to bring in revenue.)
Certainly, there are plenty of profits available for investors to take. The Dow Jones industrial average is now three times as high as it was at its 1987 peak. And a lot of that came in the last 18 months. Over that period, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 50 percent through the end of July. That was, as it happens, the best such performance since the 18 months that ended on July 31, 1987.
This column has, in the past, warned of the impact of pent-up selling demand once it became clear that the seller could qualify for a lower capital gains rate. Some sales will be made. But an offsetting factor is the widespread belief that this is a new era, one in which stocks are guaranteed to be the best long-term investment, in which neither inflation nor recession is a threat and in which baby boomers worried about retirement will put money into retirement plans -- invested in stocks -- every month. The enhanced I.R.A.'s in the tax bill could very well increase that investing.
This bull market will not last forever. But it is so strong that a mere tax incentive to sell may not have much impact. It will take something that challenges the new-era philosophy to do that. Valuations are stretched now, but they may go higher, with the party ending only when it becomes clear that the business cycle has not been repealed.

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
Younger Investors to the Muni Rescue?

BYLINE: By SHARON R. KING 

 BODY:
AT 38, Mark Hyman, a doctor in Los Angeles, does not fit the image of the typical municipal bond investor: someone in his 50's or 60's, golf club in hand, in search of a steady stream of tax-free income for retirement.
But Dr. Hyman is a buyer of municipal bond mutual funds and some individual muni bonds, and is stashing cash in a tax-exempt money market fund while he ponders new equity and fixed-income investments. "I wanted a place that was less volatile" than the stock market, he said, and that "saves me on some taxes." 
 Dr. Hyman -- and millions of baby boomers like him -- are the great hope of the municipal bond market, which has been losing investors for years. Some analysts expect that these younger people will turn to municipal bonds as a low-tax, less-risky place to park some of the money they have made from other investments.
"Many investors are capable of taking substantial capital gains, and they're saying, 'Let's translate some of the gains into income,' " said Paul Williams, a vice president of John Nuveen & Company. "That's typically munis."
So far, though, the very success of those other investments, particularly stocks, has lured investors away from municipal bonds, a trend that could be magnified by the cut in the capital gains tax that Congress passed last week, analysts say.
Investors who hold securities for more than 18 months will now have to pay a tax of just 20 percent on their gains from appreciation, down from 28 percent. While this applies to all securities, it will have far more effect on those that are bought for price appreciation, like stocks, than on those bought for their income, like municipal bonds.
But the new tax treatment will not have much effect on the municipal market, or its efforts to attract new investors, said Jim Lynch, editor of the Lynch Municipal Bond Advisory, an investment newsletter. "The newer people, they're not being dissuaded by capital gains, they're being dissuaded by the stock market," he said.
Ownership of bonds by individuals has been declining since 1991, according to Federal Reserve data. In 1996, investors held $419 billion of individual bonds, down 32 percent from 1991.
For the most part, municipal bond mutual funds have seen investor cash flowing in one direction -- out -- since 1994, according to the Investment Company Institute, a mutual fund industry trade group. This year alone, through June, $4.1 billion has left long-term municipal bond funds; last year these funds saw net outflows of $6.3 billion.
In response, fund companies are consolidating funds that are no longer big enough to run economically. For example, Fidelity Investments recently announced plans to merge three municipal bond funds -- Spartan New York Municipal Income, Spartan New York Intermediate Municipal Income and Fidelity New York Insured Municipal Income -- into the Fidelity New York Municipal Income fund. A shareholder vote on the merger is scheduled for December.
The competition from stock funds has been tough in the recent bull market, analysts say. But the exodus from muni funds has also resulted from the funds' low yields, which, when coupled with management fees, eat away at investor returns.
In part as a result of the declining demand for muni investments, the bonds' prices have yet to rebound to the levels they reached in 1993, according to data collected by the Delphis Hanover Corporation, a bond research company in Southbury, Conn.
But individual purchases of bonds are beginning to pick up, as more sophisticated investors balk at the low returns on muni mutual funds and their management fees. "Investors are thinking, 'I can do this on my own,' " said Tom Doe, president of Municipal Market Advisors, a research and risk management firm in Concord, Mass.
The changing tide even prompted Nuveen, the municipal bond fund powerhouse, to start Nuveen Asset Management almost two years ago to handle the the municipal bond portfolios of high-net worth individuals.
DESPITE the lower capital gains tax, many of these investors are unlikely to be lured away by equities. "The income-oriented investor is still going to need the income," said George D. Friedlander, a managing director and fixed-income strategist at Smith Barney. "If you need after-tax income there aren't a lot of places to go,"
And new buyers are starting to appear. At Paine Webber, these buyers include young professionals, athletes and entrepreneurs seeking tax shelters and future income, said William J. Jester Jr., a managing director and head of the municipal bond department.
They, like Dr. Hyman, see value in tax-exempt bonds.
"As my income grows, and I fill up on I.R.A.'s and pensions," Dr. Hyman said, "the rainy-day money falls into munis."

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
The Search for the Perfect Corporate Board

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT 

 BODY:
ARE stockholders asking for too much?
One might think so from the sweeping set of proposals covering the structure of corporate boards that was issued recently by one of the biggest shareholders of them all, the California Public Employees' Retirement System. 
 The list was remarkable both for the self-proclaimed importance of its mission -- "to provide a benchmark of what is 'good' corporate governance" -- and for its specificity, addressing everything from who should sit on certain committees to compensation for directors and term limits.
There's only one problem: hardly any companies in the country even come close to filling the bill.
An analysis by The New York Times of data compiled by Directorship, a consulting firm in Greenwich, Conn., shows that of the 861 public companies on the Fortune 1000 list, only one, Texas Instruments Inc., meets a wide range of basic Calpers tests, including having a majority of independent directors, a separate chief executive and independent chairman and independent committees for ethics, compensation, auditing, governance and board nominations.
Texas Instruments also meets other criteria suggested by Calpers, whose $115 billion in assets makes it the largest public pension fund in the country. The big semiconductor maker has an age limit for directors, pays a significant part of the directors' compensation in company stock and does not provide retirement benefits to board members. In addition, its directors meet regularly without the chief executive.
The New York Times analysis also yielded no clear pattern that would link "good" governance to good performance, an outcome that is consistent with many other studies.
After all, while Texas Instruments has outperformed the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index since 1990, so has the company that fails the greatest number of basic Calpers tests: the Walt Disney Company. Its board lacks a majority of outside directors, its chairman and chief executive are the same person and a number of key committees are not made up entirely of independent directors.
When told how the company's board fared against the Calpers guidelines, executives at Disney responded with a letter discussing the company's performance, including the fact that an investment made in Disney 12 years ago has grown at an average annual rate of 28.1 percent.
The company said its strong performance was the direct result "of the excellent stewardship of the Disney board of directors, one of the strongest groups of its kind in U.S. business."
CALPERS, which has long been active in governance issues, says it isn't thrown by the results of the analysis. Good governance, it said, should be viewed as a kind of insurance policy to help all companies weather the inevitable difficult times.
"Should Calpers wait until companies are in the dumper before asking them to have decent corporate governance?" said Patricia K. Macht, a spokeswoman.
Its suggested principles, the most far-reaching of several such efforts in recent years, should be viewed as a worthy goal, Calpers executives say.
Although Calpers stopped short of adopting the principles because it wanted to study two of the proposals further, even the draft version released in June has heightened the scrutiny of companies and their boards. The draft immediately raised Calpers's profile in an arena where it had grown relatively quiet, but it also invited quick criticism that the guidelines were too restrictive and that Calpers was perhaps growing too meddlesome.
"The pendulum has swung too far, and Calpers is starting to overreach," said John M. Nash, president of the National Association of Corporate Directors, which sponsored a commission last fall that issued a more modest set of recommendations on governance.
The growing debate over the Calpers proposals underscores the lack of consensus about what constitutes a "perfect" board in the first place.
While many of Calpers's principles are universally accepted, some are viewed as counterproductive. One guideline facing further study -- a limit on the number of directors who can be older than 70 -- has drawn the most fire.
"Age limits would cut off too many good people with too much savvy," said Ralph D. Ward, editor of The Corporate Board magazine and author of "21st Century Corporate Board" (Wiley, 1997). "I don't really believe Calpers wants to put in anything that firm."
For Calpers, though, the debate over the proposals is almost as important as getting the companies in which it invests to fall in line, said William D. Crist, president of Calpers, based in Sacramento, Calif.
"For a very long time, the makeup of corporate boards is a subject that has been ignored, and we do believe that the issue is very important going forward into a new global economy," Mr. Crist said. "The dialogue that is going on is very healthy."
The dialogue promises to become even more lively should Calpers formally adopt the principles, which it is expected to do later this year. At that point, Calpers will most likely send them to perhaps 500 of the largest public companies in which it owns stock and ask for explanations about how they meet the criteria. In areas where companies come up short, Calpers will expect to hear how they plan to measure up, including offering alternative ways to meet the spirit, if not the letter, of the guidelines.
Calpers then plans to grade the companies and publicize the results. Uncooperative companies, Calpers executives say, will be prodded with proxy votes and shareholder proposals.
Such a strategy strikes some experts in the field as unnecessarily heavy-handed. Ira M. Millstein, a partner at Weil, Gotshal & Manges who led the commission last year that drew up governance principles for the National Association of Corporate Directors, said he had no objection to Calpers's sharing goals to which it thinks corporate America should aspire. But to then grade companies on how they measure up is not constructive, he said.
"I don't think it's useful to put people in a bad light if they don't happen to follow what you think," Mr. Millstein said.
IF nothing else, Calpers certainly has set an ambitious target for companies to meet.
The analysis of the data compiled by Directorship showed that large numbers of companies fail some of the tests. For example, boards have for the most part purged their compensation committees of insiders because of the outcry some years back that too many executives were setting their own pay or that of their chums. Still, 77 of the 845 largest public companies that disclosed information about their compensation committee have at least one insider on the panel, which decides how well executives are paid.
The UAL Corporation, parent of United Airlines, has two insiders on its compensation committee: Gerald Greenwald, the company's chairman, and Michael H. Glawe, chairman of United's pilot union. But John D. Kiker, a spokesman, said the company felt a need to put insiders on the committee because UAL is owned, in the main, by its employees. In addition, Mr. Greenwald routinely removes himself from committee discussions about his own compensation, Mr. Kiker said.
Of the 140 companies that disclose information about their ethics committees, 21 have at least one insider on the panels. Disney has two insiders on its ethics committee: E. Cardon Walker and Raymond L. Watson, both former chairmen.
With so many specific requirements -- there are 37 principles over all -- it is inevitable that many companies that have generally served their shareholders well will fail a number of the tests.
The Calpers principles also include the recommendation that independent directors meet alone at least once a year; that the board designate a lead director when the chairman is also the chief executive and that a retiring chief executive not be allowed to continue serving on the board.
Calpers categorizes 23 principles as "fundamental" and 14 as "ideal." Calpers considers the age-limit proposal an ideal, which it would merely like companies to consider, as opposed to one of its fundamental criteria -- points on which it is less open to debate.
The philosophical underpinnings of many of the guidelines are widely held notions about the wisdom of aligning the interests of board members more closely with shareholders and otherwise making sure that boards are not too beholden to management. If there was a central message in a McKinsey & Company report from last fall that said major investors were willing to pay a premium price for companies that had good governance practices, for example, it was that directors should have a personal financial stake in running an effective board.
Like Calpers, the commission formed last year by the National Association of Corporate Directors applauded the idea of paying directors in stock.
One commission member, Charles Elson, a professor at the Stetson Law School in St. Petersburg, Fla., said stock ownership was the key to effective governance. Before Mr. Elson joined the board of the Sunbeam Corporation, the company required him to buy 5,000 shares with his own money. He now owns 9,000 shares and was traveling around Mississippi last week visiting Sunbeam plants.
"Calpers didn't tell me to do that -- my ownership led me to do that," he said. "Most of this stuff makes sense."
In the same vein, Russell S. Reynolds Jr., chairman of Directorship, attributes good corporate performance over the long term to "oversight by a board of strong, independent people truly representing the long-term interests of all the shareholders."
The kind of governance that is needed, however, is "not necessarily that dictated in the recent flurry of governance guidelines," added Mr. Reynolds, whose firm evaluates board practices and helps recruit directors.
Indeed, some of Calpers's principles and what it plans to do with them have governance experts at odds over whether they would make things better or worse.
In criticizing the proposal on age limits, Mr. Ward, editor of The Corporate Board, said that it would restrict corporate America's access to the many veteran business people who help guide fledgling companies through the difficult early years after an initial public offering.
BUT Harvey J. Goldschmid, a professor at the Columbia University Law School, said that while many directors remained effective after 70, age limits and term limits would be useful for companies that wanted some new and younger faces around the board-room table.
"It solves the etiquette problem in a relatively blunt way, but for some companies, it may be the best way," Mr. Goldschmid said. "It's difficult to tell directors they are no longer right for the job."
The Digital Equipment Corporation, for example, has come under criticism from many investors for having five directors, more than half its board, who are at least 70, and who therefore came of age professionally well before the rise of the Internet and other milestones in the computer field. Digital has called the criticism misplaced. "To criticize the effectiveness of anyone based on age is simply naive," Dan Kaferle, a Digital spokesman, said in June about the subject.
The push to put limits on the age of board members is certainly at odds with the philosophy in countries like Britain and Japan, where gray hairs are regarded as assets for directors. The Calpers plan is more in tune with foreign practices when it comes to separating the jobs of chairman and chief executive, which companies in many other countries generally do.
Ann Yerger, director of research for the Council of Institutional Investors, whose members include corporate, union and public pension funds like Calpers, predicted that some members would probably endorse all the Calpers principles. But, she added, a "fair number" of members would probably oppose at least some.
Mr. Nash, the president of the corporate directors' association, said Calpers had done a lot through the years to improve board performance, starting in the 1980's with its objections to, among other things, anti-takeover measures that protected incumbent managers and rewarded corporate raiders.
But the growing scrutiny of boards may ultimately shrink the pool of capable directors, he contended.
"Directors don't manage companies; managers manage companies," Mr. Nash said. "Good directors are tired of having their reputations maligned in the public spotlight, and good people are going to say, 'I don't need this grief.'
"I'm afraid overreaching is going to defeat the purpose," he added. "And what are the next demands? I have no idea what they may be."
For his part, Mr. Crist, the president of Calpers, defended the age-limit proposal as a way to guard against directors' growing too comfortable with one another.
"Any age is arbitrary," Mr. Crist said. "The point, if you do some historical research, is that a lot of corporate boards didn't replace members, and their members got older. It wasn't their age that was the problem, but that they had been talking to themselves for a very long time."
MR. CRIST said Calpers would be flexible when it asks companies for report cards on how they measure up to the principles. After all, Calpers itself has reasons why it does not meet all of its criteria, including the fact that some directors have served for more than 10 years. The people who make up the membership of the California Public Employees' Retirement System do not elect all its directors -- the board also includes political appointees and officers of state agencies.
"Moses didn't send these things down from the mountain, and we certainly don't expect all boards to toe the line precisely," Mr. Crist said. "There is no simple, perfect formula. We're not in a chemistry lab here making a compound."

GRAPHIC: Charts: "Uneven Practices"
Many of the tests of good governance proposed by Calpers reflect common practice at large companies, but some of the desirable traits on the Calpers list are very rare, true of as few as one company in 20. Figures for committee tests exclude companies that did not report detailed data; independent means composed entirely of outside directors.
 
Has outside chairman 5%
Only one insider on the board 18
Some form of mandatory retirement for directors 38
Independent nominating committee 60
Fewer than 10 percent of directors over 70 68
Independent governance committee 68
No retired chief executive on the board 82%
Independent ethics committee 85
Independent audit committee 86
A majority of outside directors on the board 90
Independent compensation committee 91 (Source: Directorship)(pg. 1)
 
"One in a Thousand"
To find out if the perfect board exists, Directorship examined large industrial and service companies to see which lived up to several of Calpers's key tests of good governance. Few did. The companies would have fared even worse had the analysis included hard-to-quantify criteria, including recommendations that independent directors meet without the the chief executive present at least once a year or have some expertise in fields like finance and international markets.
 
Out of the Fortune 1000 companies, 139 are not publicly traded, leaving 861.
 
PASSING THE TESTS
 
Of those 861, 778 pass the first test, with boards comprising a majority of outside directors.
 
Of those 778, 40 companies meet the next standard, with independent chairmen.
 
Of those 40, only one company, Texas Instruments, has five key committees -- compensation, governance, ethics, nominating and audit -- made up completely of outside directors.
 
FAILING THE TESTS
 
Of those 861, 83 have insiders who make up at least half the board.
 
And all 83 either have the same people serving as chairmen and chief executives or lack independent chairmen.
 
Of those 83, only Walt Disney has insiders on as many as four key committees -- compensation, ethics, nominating and audit.

HEADLINE: Medicare Crisis Is Nearly On Hold

BYLINE: By Warren Rudman and Sam Nunn; Warren Rudman, a former Republican Senator from New Hampshire, and Sam Nunn, a former Democratic Senator from Georgia, are co-chairmen of the Concord Coalition.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
For the last few days Washington has been indulging in a well-deserved round of self-congratulation over passage of the first balanced budget in three decades. After 10 years of failed deficit reduction efforts, the bill passed last week stands out as a significant bipartisan accomplishment. So why are we applauding with only one hand?
While the new balanced budget is a short-run fiscal encouragement, it fails to address the much tougher challenge waiting for us in only a decade, when the oldest members of the baby-boom generation begin signing up for Social Security, in 2008, and Medicare, in 2011. Unless we tackle this huge problem, all of the hard work to balance the budget in 2002 will be washed away in a sea of red ink. 
 The numbers are relentless. Today, the United States has about 24 million retirees. When the boomer generation is fully retired, the figure will be 48 million. But the number of working age citizens, whose payroll taxes finance most of the seniors' Social Security and Medicare benefits, will increase only 20 percent in that period. And Medicare spending per beneficiary will have continued to rise.
Well, if the balanced budget neglects the country's long-term generational challenge, how does it do in the short term?
The economy and the private sector are performing so well that revenue is pouring into the Treasury faster than politicians can claim credit for reducing the deficit. But the assumptions in the balanced budget plan mean the economy must continue performing at a strong pace. Congress, of course, can't repeal the business cycle, and the plan leaves no reserve for error.
To reach balance also requires that future Congresses and the next President live up to tough limits on discretionary spending. These ceilings have provided spending discipline for a decade. The new plan conveniently allows a $7 billion boost in the current round of appropriations bills, but the limits tighten dramatically after that. By 2002, discretionary spending will have to be reduced by 10 percent, something that sounds easier in the abstract than it will be politically, since these cuts remain unidentified.
Finally, the budget agreement will reduce Medicare reimbursements to doctors, hospitals and other health care providers by $115 billion over the next five years, which will help patch up the program's balance sheet temporarily. So will program changes that encourage beneficiaries to choose from various plans that will be offered in addition to the traditional, and expensive, fee-for-service system. But these steps, while helpful in the short term, are nowhere near enough.
The failure to respond to the long-term challenge does not mean that elected leaders are unaware of it. The Senate voted 70 to 30 in June to phase out the subsidies received by the upper-income elderly enrolled in the Part B Medicare program, which covers doctors' bills. The same day, 62 Senators voted to phase in over 30 years an increase in the Medicare eligibility age to 67 from 65, in tandem with the increase scheduled for Social Security. Both of these structural changes would help meet the long-term challenge, but, sadly, both were dropped in the final negotiations.
A bipartisan commission will be charged with reporting recommendations by March 1, 1999, on how to meet Medicare's long-term crisis. It is critical that this commission not serve as yet another excuse for delay, diversion and denial but instead call for fundamental restructuring, including means-testing, higher eligibility ages and adjustments of cost-of-living allowances. It is also important that policy makers not focus on Medicare without also considering Social Security's financing and benefit problems. The generational challenge extends well beyond Medicare and requires all of us to consider what benefits we are prepared to provide and pay for when the baby boom becomes the senior boom.

SHAREHOLDER REVOLUTION
Sallie Mae's Management Ousted in Favor of Dissidents
In what one analyst called "the stock market equivalent of the Boston Tea Party," shareholders of the Student Loan Marketing Association ousted the management by electing a dissident slate of directors to run the company. "It's a revolution," said the analyst, Jonathan E. Gray, of Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. Shareholders also overwhelmingly approved a plan to turn Sallie Mae, a Government-sponsored enterprise, into a fully private, state-chartered corporation. On the New York Stock Exchange, Sallie Mae's shares immediately surged almost $5.
 
BALANCING THE BUDGET
Is Everyone Happy?
In Washington, euphoria reigned as politicians of both parties congratulated themselves on agreeing to balance the Federal budget and to provide the first Federal tax cut in 16 years. "We have put America's fiscal house in order again," President Clinton proclaimed. Republicans, like Representative Bill Archer of Texas, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, hailed the agreement as the culmination of their quest to slim down Government. But economists, ever the dismal scientists, were skeptical that all would go as planned. Taxes on long-term capital gains are to be cut to a top rate of 20 percent, and eventually to 18 percent. And new rules increased the tax advantages of individual retirement accounts for millions of Americans. The package also provides child care credits, tax benefits for college students, health insurance options for the elderly, higher airline ticket taxes, lower estate taxes and higher cigarette taxes. 

THE ECONOMY
Looking Up, Looking Down
Adding to Washington's cheer was news that the economy slowed during the spring as consumers cut back on spending. The gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 2.2 percent in the April-June period, less than half that of the preceding quarter, showing no danger of inflation, even though employee compensation costs rose slightly in the spring. Sales of new single-family homes rose 6.1 percent in June, showing the housing sector entered the third quarter on a solid footing. "It's about as good as it can get for a fully employed economy," said Robert G. Dederick, economic consultant to Chicago's Northern Trust Company. But on Friday two reports revived fears of inflation. The unemployment rate dropped to a 24-year low of 4.8 percent in July, and the National Association of Purchasing Management index rose to its highest level in two and a half years, 58.6, showing expansion in manufacturing.
 
THE MARKETS
A Whiff of Inflation
After a record-setting first part of the week, inspired by the favorable economic data and the budget agreement, markets stumbled on Friday as the unemployment and purchasing managers' numbers reignited fears of inflation and higher interest rates. The bellwether 30-year Treasury bond, whose lower yields have recently propelled stocks higher, sank 1 26/32, pushing its yield to 6.45 percent from Thursday's close of 6.29 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average was still up 80.60 points for the week, at 8,194.04. The Nasdaq composite rose 24.75 points, to 1,594.33.
 
CAREER MOVES
New Chief for Donna Karan; Jobs Tries Recruiting for Apple
Deciding to concentrate on her role as chief designer, Donna Karan stepped down as chief executive of her namesake company and named John Idol, right, an executive from Polo Ralph Lauren and an expert in licensing, to the post. Wall Street analysts hailed the move. Stephen L. Ruzow resigned as president of the company but will remain a consultant for six months. Attempting to restore Apple Computer to health, Steven P. Jobs, its co-founder and now an adviser to the company, has been trying to persuade Eastman Kodak's chief executive, George M. C. Fisher, to come to Apple, according to an executive who knows both men. So far, Mr. Fisher is not biting.
 
THE MERGER FRONT
Chips on the Table
Consolidation in the chip industry accelerated, as National Semiconductor agreed to acquire Cyrix in a stock swap the companies valued at $550 million, and Intel said it would acquire Chips and Technologies, a producer of graphics processing chips for personal computers, for $384 million. Fujitsu of Japan said it would pay $850 million for the 58 percent of Amdahl that it did not already own. Also, Sun Microsystems agreed to acquire Diba Inc., a start-up company that is developing technology for small communications and computing devices called information appliances. Terms were not disclosed.
 
THE DEAL FLIES
KLM to Sell Northwest Stake
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines agreed to sell its 19 percent stake in Northwest Airlines back to Northwest for more than $1 billion -- a tidy profit on an initial investment of $400 million. The two have maintained a successful operating alliance, but a two-year legal squabble over KLM's investment threatened to undermine it. Now the lawsuits are to be withdrawn, and the carriers are to expand their relationship into potentially lucrative new areas like cargo transportation and linking their computer systems.
 
SCANDAL IN JAPAN
Penalties for Nomura And a Leading Bank
Japan's Finance Ministry, in the strongest punitive action it has ever taken against major financial institutions, ordered Nomura Securities and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank to suspend part of their operations for the rest of this year as punishment for making payments and loans to a racketeer. Still, analysts said, the penalties were more lenient than expected and should not result in red ink. Illegal dealings that could undermine the market's credibility are believed to be widespread in Japan. Tokyo prosecutors raided the headquarters of Yamaichi Securities on suspicion that it, too, had made payments to the same racketeer.
 
THE SPORTS BUSINESS
G.M. Goes for Gold
Is the business of America still business, or is it sport? General Motors committed some $900 million to sponsor the Olympics through 2008 -- a wager that the next six Winter and Summer Games will continue to galvanize public interest. The deal with NBC and the United States Olympics Committee is expected to be the first of many. AT&T, Coca-Cola and Anheuser-Busch, all longtime Olympic sponsors, may well follow suit. Nor is America's obsession unique. Alan Shearer, captain of Britain's national soccer team and center forward for Newcastle United, badly tore his ankle ligament in a preseason tournament last weekend. When the London stock exchange opened for trading on Monday, $20 million disappeared from Newcastle's share valuation.

HEADLINE: The World;
The Overfed Tiger Economies

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

 BODY:
BY the time they make it from the airport to the hotel, first-time visitors to the "tiger economies" of Southeast Asia almost all blurt out the same question: Where did all the money come from?
In Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysians are putting the finishing touches on the world's tallest twin towers, and the national car, the Proton, competes for space with Mercedes on the streets below. Bangkok, once known as the Venice of Asia for its tree-lined canals, has filled every watery inch with concrete to support office towers that stretch into the polluted mist. Even the Philippines, once Asia's basket case, finally has its act together. 
 So the financial crisis that has shaken the region in recent weeks -- huge currency devaluations, the International Monetary Fund sweeping in to prop up the Philippines and virtually take over the central bank of Thailand -- naturally raises the question of how much of this phenomenal growth is a chimera. Are the tigers just large house cats? Have they caught Japan disease, letting their banks get ahead of their brains, lending money with abandon for multibillion-dollar projects no one needed?
 
Conspiracy, No
 And what about the weird conspiracy theories of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad of Malaysia, who charges that speculators like George Soros used their market prowess to undermine Southeast Asia's currencies? Mr. Mahathir's complaint that Malaysia's decades of hard work were unraveled by mysterious foreign forces in "a period of weeks" prompted Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, in Kuala Lumpur last week for an annual meeting of the region's leaders, to publicly ridicule the whole notion.
"There is a search on for scapegoats," said Clyde Prestowitz, a trade expert who served on a Presidential commission appointed last year to come up with a new strategy for dealing with the region. "They were used to being the world's economic hothouse, and it's a bit of a shock when an Arctic breeze flows through the door."
Mr. Prestowitz is right: When you are accustomed to watching your economy grow at 8 percent or 10 percent a year, the prospect of mere 6 percent growth can seem like a national crisis. For all of Mr. Mahathir's squawking, his country is likely to post better than 8 percent growth this year and next -- while the quite healthy American economy, by comparison, has managed a little more than 3 percent this year.
But there are some real cracks in Southeast Asia's economic infrastructure -- cracks that investors often overlooked as they raced to grab a piece of what mutual fund hawkers enthusiastically call "the world's fastest-growing economies."
Thailand is a good place to start. The country launched its own satellites, published five-year plans, built car plants faster than it built highways and became the darling of mutual fund managers around the world. In fact, most of its mega-projects were financed with foreign money (much of it Japanese), a river of cash so wide and so deep that it covered up economic strains.
What was missing was discipline on the part of the country's politicians and financial managers. Prestige or under-the-table money governed decisions to invest in major projects, many of which added little to the nation's competitive power. After all, how many car factories does the world need?
Banks lent money on the assumption that land would only grow scarcer -- offering rationales about why they were not headed down the path of the Japanese, who made the same flawed assumption in the late 1980's and early 90's, when the land under the Imperial Palace in Tokyo was said to be worth more than the state of Florida. When investors don't blink at such comparisons, something's wrong.
In Thailand, they blinked. Speculators realized that Thailand's policy of linking its currency to the dollar and the yen -- the two forms of money with the greatest aura of stability -- was unsustainable unless the country could improve productivity, lower wages and rein in the banks and the corruption. To make their point, they started selling Thai baht, and the Government spent billions in the markets trying to fend off the attacks. Eventually the dam broke. The Thais dismissed their central bankers and, in desperation, turned to the International Monetary Fund, which has been given new authority -- and a special fund -- to solve such problems since Mexico's similar crisis in late 1994.
And like the Mexicans, they are being made an offer they can't refuse: They must cut their deficits, stop borrowing, clean up the drunken banks and reveal to the world what the country's finances really look like.
So did the speculators cause this problem, or just exacerbate it? "In almost every case," said Lawrence Summers, the Deputy Treasury Secretary and the man who designed the Mexican bailout, "major financial disturbances almost always have deeper causes than a few speculators. And it's important to remember that you can't attack 'speculation' without also undermining the flow of capital that can finance productive investment."
 
So Forward-Looking
 In fact, neither the Thais nor Mr. Mahathir were complaining about the cruelties of global capital markets when investors were pouring $60 billion to $70 billion a year into East Asia, roughly two-thirds of all the money invested in the developing world in the mid-90's. Then the speculators were wise investors who understood the economies of the future.
With the immediate crisis blowing over, the big question now is how the tigers claw their way past the meanest animal in the forest: China. One reason exports have slowed -- particularly of electronics, the boom industry of the region -- is that the Chinese are getting better at producing the same products at far lower costs.
"It's the same phenomenon we saw in Korea," the former South Korean foreign minister, Han Sung Joo, said in Washington last week. South Korea benefited greatly from a flood of investment in the 1980's, and the money stayed around long enough for the wealth to spread throughout the country. But the run-up in wages eventually sent investors fleeing to Southeast Asia.
Now the process is speeding up. Before the Thais had a chance to fully exploit the benefits of being a tiger, the investment money is beginning to hit the road. "The problem in Southeast Asia," said Mr. Han, "is that there is still a big gulf between the rich in the cities and the poor. The money went into the fancy hotels before it went into the factories."

Many Southeast Asian economies have slipped lately but are still growing at enviable rates, according to an analysis published by the Asian Development Bank this spring, before the region's currency crisis. Graph tracks the percent change in the gross domestic products of nations in the region, from 1991 through 97.

Politicians Dine on the Crime Dip

BYLINE: By DAVID JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
Politicians from President Clinton to Mayor Rudolph W. Guiliani of New York have patted themselves on the back as Federal crime reports show that the rates of most violent crimes, like murder, are falling to their lowest levels since the early 1960's.
Now Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr. of Washington, whose city has the reputation as a murder capital, says Washington is "as safe or safer" than Topeka, Kan. Last week Washington police officials reported that 149 people were slain in the first half of 1997, a 25 percent decline from 1996's midyear toll. Washington still has a higher murder rate than many other cities (like Topeka, which had 17 murders in 1996), but its drop is comparable to the decrease in homicides in New York, where murders fell by 30 percent in the first half of this year. 
 Political leaders have been quick to take credit for the falling crime rate, saying it is the result of community-based policing, tougher prison sentences and stricter gun laws. But many criminologists find the crime drop a bit mysterious, involving not only local policies but a booming economy, a decline in warfare between drug-trafficking gangs and the aging of baby boomers who are growing out of their crime-prone years. And some predict the drop may be short-lived. Why? The number of people in their teenage years will grow by one percent each year over the next decade. DAVID JOHNSTON

Bringing Diversity to the Politics of Distrust

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
DAVID N. DINKINS lost the New York mayoralty four years ago in part because of what some people called his timorous response to a black-led boycott of a Korean-owned grocery store. So it was more than a little noteworthy when the Rev. Al Sharpton -- another black man seeking to be Mayor of New York -- showed up at a dinner of Korean-Americans the other evening to deliver a cordial if awkward talk about race and politics.
"Tonight, I'm doing a lot of reaching out," Mr. Sharpton said, leaving an untouched plate of Korean food as he took his spot at the lectern. "We must protect each other's rights and existence. The minorities of this city are together the majority of this city." 
 Mr. Sharpton's appearance at a midtown Korean restaurant suggested an unlikely development in race and politics in 1997. So did the questions posed to this familiar symbol of black activism (almost none had to do with race), and his reception afterwards (the audience clamored around him, seeking autographs and photographs). Indeed, the evening pointed up that the highest-profile urban political campaign of the year has been notable not for what it is about, but for what it is not about: Race.
It seems that racial politics, even racist politics, are not quite as simple as they once were. What had been a clear-cut matter of, well, black and white, has become staggeringly complicated since the days when Archie Bunker knew precisely where to direct his venom from his armchair in a Queens living room. It has become harder to figure out who to hate. And so it is that political candidates are finding it trickier to incorporate race into appeals for votes.
In part, this is because the edges of racial antagonisms have been blunted a bit by good economic times. But more than that, the growing diversity of the nation's cities appears to be forcing a redefinition of racism. A campaign swing with a candidate in Boston, Miami or Los Angeles these days can seem like a trip around the world.
Take New York, the city that most scholars view as the best example of Archie Bunker's changing universe. In 1970, whites made up 63 percent of New York's population and blacks 20 percent, and the city's unpleasant racial dynamics reflected that. The remaining 17 percent were mostly Hispanic (Asians were barely 1 percent).
But by the year 2000, the city's Planning Department projects, non-Hispanic whites will be just 35 percent of New Yorkers and blacks 26 percent. The remaining 39 percent -- though many are not citizens, and thus not voters -- are Chinese, Dominicans, Ecuadorans, Cubans, Mexicans, Indians, Salvadorans and Peruvians (to mention a few). Mr. Sharpton's recent electoral target, Koreans, tripled as a proportion of the city's population from 1980 to 1990, and now make up a full 1 percent.
 
Pandering Gets Tough
 What that means is that racial appeals -- benign ones encouraging ethnic identity and malignant ones tapping into racism -- are not so easy anymore. First, it's hard to figure which group to pander to in cities where there is no such thing as an ethnic majority.
Most intriguing is what this means for the coarser form of racial appeal. There have always been coded ways in which candidates have exploited prejudices, but these tactics have become trickier in more complicated electoral landscapes.
What, after all, is the difference between appealing to racial animosities, which is often effective, and to anti-immigrant feelings, which might be politically ruinous in many cities? It's a critical difference, as Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has demonstrated by portraying himself as an advocate for immigrants.
Of course, none of this is meant to suggest that America has reached the mountaintop; it would be quite a stretch to suggest that big cities are on the threshold of racial peace. Tom Hayden did call Mayor Richard J. Riordan of Los Angeles a racist in the final heated days of his very losing campaign, and he went on to win the city's black votes by a three-to-one margin. A New York Times poll in the spring found that black and white New Yorkers held opposite views on nearly every major issue. The two groups couldn't even agree about the quality of the city's water.
Indeed, the animosities between ethnic groups are arguably not so much gone as more diffuse. Blacks marched on Koreatown during the 1992 riots in Los Angeles. And in New York, Mr. Sharpton is extraordinarily unpopular among Hispanic people.
"I was in Bay Ridge and I heard an Italian woman cursing the influx of Arabs in a once-Italian neighborhood," said Mitchell Moss, the director of New York University's Urban Research Center. "Southern Brooklyn is becoming Asian and Arab. The old Italian neighborhoods are vanishing. That's discombobulating people."
There are some circumstances in this year's elections that contribute to a sense of racial equanimity. Mr. Sharpton is a long-shot candidate, and the final lineup in New York's race is expected to be, as in Los Angeles, white versus white. "There are no minority folks running for citywide office," Mr. Dinkins says by way of an explanation.
Mr. Dinkins also says race is being ignored because the news media have failed to give racial injustices the attention they warrant. But Ruth W. Messinger, the leading candidate for the Democratic mayoral nomination, has also avoided such subjects.
And it's not a surprise. After all, when Mr. Hayden accused Mr. Riordan of racism, he triggered a furor so intense he was forced to apologize. Mr. Riordan then trounced his Democratic opponent, in no small part because of the emergence of a new center of power in that city's politics. For the first time, Hispanic voters outnumbered blacks. They took a liking to Mr. Riordan.

Clinton Sees History in the Budget-Making . . .

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
IN the wake of the final budget deal, Washington talk was as thick last week with the word "historic" as with such staples as "bipartisanship" and "campaign reform."
President Clinton plainly hopes that a deal to balance the budget will get him into the history books. Dick Morris, his former adviser, tells us that just a year ago, this very item was number two on a list of four major items he told the President he needed to insure a high ranking in posterity. Mr. Clinton's brief remarks announcing the agreement on Tuesday, with three "historics," four "futures" and three "generations" in a few minutes, shows the lesson took. 
 Some professional President-judgers think the plan will work. Richard Norton Smith, a biographer of one President, Herbert W. Hoover, one losing candidate, Thomas E. Dewey, and Col. Robert R. McCormick, the publisher of The Chicago Tribune "who thought he was more important than any President," offered encouragement.
Mr. Smith said Mr. Clinton might succeed where Jimmy Carter failed, in being "remembered as the first Democratic President who realized that the New Deal was over" and moved the party with him. "If he can equate the Democratic Party with economic prosperity," he said, "then he will have completed the work that Jimmy Carter began a generation ago."
 
Captives of Their Times
 But more historians had their doubts. Robert V. Remini, biographer of Presidents Martin van Buren and Andrew Jackson (and the disappointed candidates Henry Clay and Daniel Webster), said that most Presidents worry about their place in history, but that "sometimes there is really nothing they can do because the times are not conducive to great actions and great decisions and great results."
Jackson, Mr. Remini noted, "was the only President who ever eliminated the national debt, and he got very little credit for it." And while balancing the budget was certainly important, he said, it did not really count as a great issue.
"There is one, and that is the race question," he said, which Mr. Clinton has talked about earnestly but does not seem to be solving.
The same thought, more bluntly, came from Robert A. Caro, Lyndon B. Johnson's biographer, who recalled Johnson's great speech in the House chamber proposing the 1965 Voting Rights Act. " 'Balance the budget' doesn't have the same ring as 'We shall overcome,' " he said.
Another critical voice was offered by John Kenneth Galbraith, an ally of President John F. Kennedy and a liberal economist and economic historian. He said balanced budgets were not necessarily a good idea because supporting a balanced budget was usually a device of "people who are seeking to reduce the social role of the state." He said, "You never hear a balanced budget advanced when defense is at stake."
Nathan Miller, a biographer of both Roosevelts, was skeptical both of the significance of balancing the budget and of it being a lasting achievement. "His accomplishment may not outlast his term," he said. "These things are usually done with smoke and mirrors." But he said he had not included Mr. Clinton among the subjects of his next book, "Star-Spangled Men: America's Ten Worst Presidents."
 
Balancing Act
 That uncertainty was also conveyed by Robert Dallek, a Johnson biographer, who said that balancing the budget was not only not "terribly sexy," but that its impact was uncertain. "If we get through the next 10 or 15 years with terrific growth," he said, prosperity might make Mr. Clinton's reputation. But, he observed, "That's pretty dicey."
Even if few Presidents have been remembered for prosperity (as Mr. Morris said he warned Mr. Clinton), Douglas Brinkley, who is finishing a Carter biography, said, "I can't imagine people bemoaning the Clinton years.
"He redirected the Democratic Party," Mr. Brinkley said, and also redesigned himself from a first-term "policy wonk" into someone who judged well where America wanted to be. His biggest problem, he said, was that "more than anything else, Clinton is trying to not be Warren Harding, where scandals overtake a legacy."
If the President is fortunate, Mr. Brinkley said, his legacy would amount to "good government, political shrewdness, warding off the Republican right and overseeing economic prosperity."
But the historians all observed that Presidential reputations are exercises in constant renovation. Mr. Dallek quoted the Dutch historian Pieter Geyl as saying, "History is indeed an argument without end."
Mr. Clinton, who will be 53 as he leaves office, may get a better sense of that than most Presidents. Mr. Smith said, "He's going to live long enough to see his reputation on a roller coaster."

HEADLINE: Fake Licenses Tied to Bribes In California

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Calif., Aug. 2

 BODY:
Investigators say the quest for a counterfeit-proof driver's license has spurred a black market in which state workers issue fraudulent licenses in return for bribes of $200 to $1,000 each.
The California Department of Motor Vehicles fears that at least 25,000 fraudulently issued licenses are on the street. Seventy-nine employees have been dismissed in the last 19 months, and investigators estimate that 250 of the department's 8,000 employees may be involved in the scam. 
 The California driver's license, held by 20.2 million motorists, is a basic identification document and gives people access to other forms of identification. Licenses are used as proof of identity for everything from welfare applications to bank accounts.
The California card incorporates numerous anti-counterfeit safeguards, including holographic images, coding and layering, to make it all but impossible to duplicate.
But the increased difficulty of counterfeiting licenses means that people unable to obtain them legitimately, including undocumented immigrants and people with revoked licenses, try to buy them by bribing clerks.
"Ironically, as our documents become more tamper-proof, it's become more of a problem," said the Director of the Department of Motor Vehicles, Sally Reed.
The California department's investigation has led to the dismissal of 24 clerks since May, most of them for driver's license or registration fraud. Six others have been disciplined.
An additional 55 clerks were dismissed after investigations dating to January 1996 into similar activities. At least two prison terms have been meted out -- a three-year sentence in one case and a one-year term in another, said a department spokesman, Bill Gengler.
California officials say they do not know whether other states are seeing a similar increase in internal fraud. But many other states are introducing anti-counterfeit measures on the licenses they issue, and California investigators say that is the driving force behind the increased fraud here.

HEADLINE: Survey Ranks Nigeria as Most Corrupt Nation

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

 BODY:
For the second year running, a survey of executives and public opinion worldwide has found that Nigeria tops the list of the most corrupt countries to do business, an independent monitoring organization said in a report last week.
The third Corruption Perception Index issued by the organization, Transparency International, listed Denmark as the least corrupt place to do business. The United States was ranked the 16th-cleanest country among the 52 nations surveyed for the 1997 report. 
 Introducing this year's survey, Dr. Peter Eigen, a former World Bank official who is chairman of Transparency International, said his five-year-old organization "is not saying in this index that one country is more corrupt than another."
"We are reporting how business people around the globe perceive levels of corruption," he said.
The compilers of the survey acknowledge that some of their information comes from companies involved in corrupt practices. Some are large international corporations frequently criticized by developing nations for indulging or acquiescing in practices that the companies and their governments then condemn.
Over the last few years, corruption has become a much more public issue as international aid organizations, like the United Nations Development Program and the World Bank, have warned developing nations that bad reputations are costing them needed investment.
In a period of shrinking foreign aid, governments are also under pressure to withhold or reduce assistance because of the perception that a considerable part of the money spent is wasted on bribes and kickbacks.
In May, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, representing the world's industrial nations, asked its members to agree this year to pass laws against corrupt practices and to put an end to tax deductibility for bribes paid in business transactions.
Frank Vogl, vice chairman of Transparency International, said in an interview on Thursday that the founders of the organization have been surprised by the chord that their message has struck in many capitals, including in the third world.
Transparency International has chapters in more than 70 countries and its headquarters in Berlin. It compiles its annual list using information gathered from its own Internet network and from studies made by major polling or risk-analysis organizations -- including Gallup International, the Political and Economic Risk Consultancy of Hong Kong and the DRI/McGraw-Hill Global Risk Service.
The list, which is drawn up under the direction of Dr. Johann Graf Lambsdorff, an economist at Gottingen University in Germany, sets 10 as the cleanest score and 0 as the most corrupt. Nations are arrayed on the scale after information from four or more sources is averaged.
Nigeria scored a 1.76 this year, substantially lower than the next country most frequently cited for corruption, Bolivia, at 2.05. Other countries scoring under 3 were Colombia, Russia, Pakistan, Mexico, Indonesia, India, Venezuela and Vietnam.
At the top of the scale after Denmark, with a 9.94 score, business leaders consider Finland, Sweden, New Zealand, Canada and the Netherlands -- all with scores over 9 -- the least corrupt countries. Among other countries that scored higher than the United States, with a 7.61 rating, were Singapore, Ireland and Israel.
The Transparency International list is limited to 52 countries because the compilers do not have enough sources of information to make a fair judgment on other nations, Dr. Lambsdorff said in a statement accompanying the report.
At the Nigerian Embassy in Washington, Patrick Ayendi, the information attache, said that the perception of Nigeria as corrupt was no longer based on fact.
"I can tell you very categorically that the present regime in Nigeria has fought corruption down to its barest minimum," he said. "At Government level, if any official is found to be corrupt in Nigeria, you are not only relieved of your duties, you are also prosecuted."
He said the Government welcomed cooperation from other nations where accusations of corruption against Nigerians arise.

HEADLINE: 35 Communities Are Eligible for Loans Under Nafta Program

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 2

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration, accused of not doing enough to deal with job losses caused by increased competition from Canada and Mexico under the North American Free Trade Agreement, has released a list of 35 communities in 19 states that will be eligible for economic development loans.
A group of Hispanic members of Congress said last month that the Administration was dragging its feet in carrying out the loan program. No loans have been approved even though the trade agreement took effect more than three years ago. 
 Businesses in the designated areas, which include Syracuse and Fulton, N.Y.; Elizabeth, N.J., and Dayville, Conn., will be able to apply for loans and loan guarantees administered through the North American Development Bank. Treasury officials said more communities would be added in coming months.
The $3 billion bank was set up by Congress in 1993 as part of the legislation that created Nafta. It is supposed to provide loans for environmental cleanup projects along the United States' border with Mexico and support economic development in cities hit hard by job losses caused by increased competition from Mexico and Canada.
In a letter sent last month to President Clinton, a group of Hispanic lawmakers threatened to withhold support for the Administration's efforts to expand Nafta to other Latin American countries unless more was done to help displaced American workers.
Representative Esteban Torres, Democrat of California, one of the main sponsors of the development bank in 1993, said on Friday that he was disappointed that more areas were not included on the initial list, given that the Labor Department had certified job losses from Nafta in virtually every state.
"This is an answer to some of the criticism we raised, but much remains to be done," Mr. Torres said in an interview. "There is still a long way to go."
The trade agreement over all has bolstered the United States economy through increased exports to Mexico and Canada, but care must be taken to deal with workers who have lost jobs, Administration officials said.
"While Nafta has benefited the U.S. economy as a whole, we are committed to insuring that capital is available to create new job opportunities where they are most needed," Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin said in a statement.
The loans and loan guarantees will go to businesses to support jobs in the designated areas.
The economic development office of the North American Development Bank is in Los Angeles, but officials said businesses could also apply through their local Small Business Administration or the Agriculture Department.
Following are the 31 other communities declared eligible by the Treasury Department for business loans under the program:
Ketchikan, Alaska; Blytheville, Des Arc and Pocahontas, Ark.; Pacoima, Santa Ana and Watsonville, Calif.; Dawson and Vidalia, Ga.; Hayden Lake, Idaho; Monon, Ind.; Coushatta, La., and White Pine, Mich.
Also, St. Joseph, Mo.; Chocowinity, Laurinburg, Lumberton, Rocky Mount, Tarboro and Washington, N.C.; Greenfield, Ohio; Erie and Lewistown, Pa.; Celina, Tenn.; Brownsville, El Paso and Robstown, Tex.; Centralia and Richland, Wash., and Hawkins and Racine, Wis.

HEADLINE: In America;
Brick By Brick

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT; William Safire is on vacation.

 BODY:
There was a time, not long ago, when the Bronx would set itself on fire every night. Darkness would fall and entire sections of the borough seemed to go up in flames. A national audience once watched this phenomenon on television, when the Yankees were in the World Series. Off in the distance, beyond the lights of the stadium, the flames from several fires could be seen licking at the sky. Howard Cosell provided the commentary.
The fires combined with a hideous array of less-spectacular problems to reduce vast acres of the Bronx to ruins. In 1990, even as jokesters were quipping that there was nothing left to burn, a fire at the Happy Land Social Club in the East Tremont section killed an astonishing 87 people. 
 To most observers, the Bronx was a twisted and ghastly place, the quintessential example of all that was wrong with America's cities. Novelists, movie makers, journalists and national politicians in search of urban desolation all headed for the Bronx.
That was then. If you care to hop a northbound subway now you will find in the Bronx a great deal of evidence that devastated inner-city neighborhoods can be reborn. It is a slow and complicated process that doesn't readily lend itself to a novel or a screenplay, but it is happening.
A few days ago I spoke with a longtime resident named Sharon Jacobs. We were standing in the air-conditioned hallway of a renovated apartment building two blocks from the site of the Happy Land fire. The hallway was well lit and smelled of fresh paint.
"This building was always dark and the drug dealers lived right there," Ms. Jacobs said, pointing down the hall. "It was like people from the street just came in and took over, like it was their building. Squatters, drug dealers. It was very dangerous. You can see how it's changed."
The building, on Southern Boulevard, is one of several blighted residential and commercial structures that have been transformed by the Aquinas Housing Corporation, a nonprofit group that has been one of the many participants in the heroic fight to reverse the decline of neighborhoods across the Bronx.
Similar efforts are under way in cities around the country and many are very successful. But they don't get a lot of attention. Newspaper editors and television producers develop nervous tics and extended fits of yawning when reporters try to explain the importance of C.D.C.'s (community development corporations, of which Aquinas is one), supportive housing, creative mortgage financing and low-income tax credits. Careers have been derailed at the mere mention of the word "urban."
So you won't hear much about a group like Aquinas reclaiming a neighborhood with fresh housing, services for the homeless and the elderly, recreation programs for children and employment training for able-bodied adults. And yet its work, and that of thousands of similarly unheralded groups, is one of the key reasons for the improving health of cities.
Aquinas is one of about 700 nonprofit neighborhood groups supported by the Enterprise Foundation, which was established in 1982 to help local organizations create affordable housing. The sustaining idea of the foundation is that the availability of decent housing is essential if low-income people are to become self-sufficient. It is very hard to do great things if your mailing address is a broken-down park bench.
What has been happening around the country is that C.D.C.'s, some affiliated with Enterprise and some not, are using the cornerstone of affordable housing as a way of reclaiming one blighted neighborhood after another. These are for the most part well-planned and financially rigorous ventures that use the expertise of both public and private organizations. The Enterprise Foundation alone has raised more than $2 billion in low-interest loans, grants and equity investments for such projects.
"It is important to show that these successes can occur and that they can be replicated," said William Frey, director of Enterprise's New York office. He noted that attitudes toward big-city neighborhoods change as the housing improves, homeownership expands, crime and other problems diminish, and new stores and churches begin to be built.
That is what is happening now. Eventually, even television will notice.

HEADLINE: Lonely Song of a Chinese Minstrel Bares a Migrant's Lament

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON 

DATELINE: HAIKOU, China, July 28

 BODY:
Over the clatter of Chinese meal-making in the outdoor food stalls that overflow with diners on a hot summer evening, Shen Ping sings with a lonely voice.
A long-faced young woman with wide eyes, Ms. Shen wanders with a friend from one stall to the next through a back alley in this southern city, offering to strum her guitar for any customer willing to throw a dollar her way. 
 Stopping beside a low-lying table piled high with dishes and surrounded by six men on small wooden stools, Ms. Shen and her partner sing a duet earnestly, if a little off-key. It is a sentimental love song, something about being far from home, which is apt enough for the two young women, since they are migrants.
Hundreds of thousands of outsiders looking for easy money have flocked to this part of Hainan Island, touted as China's Hawaii by development-hungry local officials. Most of them, like Ms. Shen and her friend, Lan Feng, have to settle for something less.
A leader in free-wheeling economic reforms, Hainan, off China's southern coast, rode a real-estate boom in 1990-1992, only to suffer badly from a crash in 1993. Thousands of half-built hotels lie vacant, like ghosts of another era.
But young people like Ms. Shen still pour into Hainan because, even with a downturn, China's coastal areas offer more opportunity than most of the slower-growing interior.
"Mainlanders do the kind of jobs that locals would never want," said Hong Yansheng, a food stall manager, referring to the migrants. "A local resident would never sing for money. You lose too much face."
In many nations, immigrants often do the kind of work that native-born residents look down on. In China, migrants from other parts of the country play that role, on an enormous scale.
More than 100 million of China's 1.2 billion people are estimated to be on the move, leaving their homes to look for work elsewhere. This floating population is causing an enormous but largely unmeasured social upheaval across the country.
When Ms. Shen, 23, left her village in Anhui province four months ago, she came to Hainan because a friend told her she could easily find a job in a hotel. But Ms. Shen found that one hotel after another would only offer work in a massage parlor, which she declined to do.
Instead, she bought a guitar and teamed up with Ms. Lan.
"I get tired of the men who pinch my rear end, but I can always walk away," said Ms. Shen.
Ms. Shen said she made about $25 to $35 a night, more than 10 times what she made working as a store clerk in her hometown. She sends $50 home to her parents each month, but will not tell them the truth about how she earns her living.
"They think it's bad for a girl to work on the street," she said. "I tell them I am an attendant in a hotel."
At another food stall, a diner who was red-faced from beer-drinking called Ms. Shen and her partner over to play.
"Where are you from, little sister?" he asked.
Ms. Shen eyed him warily, and did not answer. Instead she asked if he had any requests.
"As you like," said the man. "Sing a beautiful one."
Ms. Shen had hardly begun her song when the man waved her off.
"That's terrible!" he said loudly. "Sing another!"
Letting her finish this time, the man reluctantly gave Ms. Shen the equivalent of $1.25. She and Ms. Lan headed for the next stall.

HEADLINE: Some in Latin America Fear End of U.S. Ban Will Stir Arms Race

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS 

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, Aug. 2

 BODY:
The armed forces of Latin America celebrated the Clinton Administration's decision on Friday to permit the sale of advanced weapons that were restricted for decades. But many other government officials and military analysts expressed concern today that the move could set off a regional arms race in which countries feel under pressure to buy sophisticated weapons they neither need nor can afford.
"It's a matter of keeping up with the Joneses," said a senior Argentine military official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "If these new weapons become available and your neighbor acquires them, no one in your house is going to sleep well at night unless you get the same level of security." 
 Argentina initially opposed a relaxation in the United States ban, saying sharp budget cutbacks had reduced its ability to pay for advanced weapons. But Argentine military officials said today that the lifting of the ban would only strengthen their argument that after years of reductions they need a major increase in weapons spending to remain competitive.
In Chile, Argentina's cash-rich neighbor to the west, military officials were said to be elated over the removal of the weapons ban, especially since the decision comes at a time when the air force plans to spend $400 million this year to buy about two dozen new jet fighters.
Chile had considered buying Swedish JAS-39 Grippen and French Mirage 2000-5 fighters, but military officials there have said they would prefer American-made F-16's.
Indeed, the Lockheed Martin Corporation, an American contractor that makes the F-16, had lobbied heavily for the Administration to lift the ban, particularly because Chile was about to close the bidding process to supply its new fighter planes.
"This is certainly great news for the purchaser, and the Chilean Air Force must be on top of the moon with this news," Raul Sohr, an independent military analyst, said in a telephone interview from Santiago, Chile. "But personally, I find it a bit distressing that the States is putting an end to a policy that has served this region so well for decades. This is the beginning of an arms race. There's no denying that."
Mr. Sohr said that although both Argentina and Brazil have reduced military spending in recent years, he expected them to come up with the money for the advanced planes, radars, tanks and other weapons that the United States is now making available.
"The reasons for lifting this ban are purely commercial and political," Mr. Sohr added. "The United States wants the economic benefit of selling these weapons and also the political influence that goes along with servicing and supplying them."
Some experts cited Peru's recent purchase of a squadron of Russian MIG-29's at an estimated cost of $350 million as a factor in persuading the Administration to lift the ban, which was imposed by President Carter in 1978, when many Latin American nations were under military dictatorships.
In Argentina, Horacio Jaunarena, an opposition congressman and a former Defense Minister, said he believed that selling such advanced weapons to Latin America would result in an arms buildup.
"To avoid an arms race, the effort has to come from the countries that are selling the weapons," he said. "But I understand that United States citizens are asking themselves, why don't we sell arms when other countries like Russia, Belgium or Germany are doing it."

HEADLINE: A Tax Cut Your Lawyer Will Love

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
Investors, students and families with children are not the only people who will benefit from the first major Federal income tax cut in 16 years. Accountants, lawyers, tax preparers and publishers of tax books and software also expect to put a lot of money into their pockets, from people paying them to learn how to take advantage of the tax breaks.
The tax bill newly passed by Congress adds "a nightmare of complexity" to existing law, said Verenda Smith, a spokeswoman for the Federation of Tax Administrators, the association of state tax agencies. 
 Patrick Fleenor, an economist at the Tax Foundation, a research organization in Washington, said, "This tax bill is a gift to the middle class, but it's also a gift to the lawyers and accountants who will do a lot of business helping take advantage of it."
And Doug Ammerman, partner in charge of financial planning at the accounting firm of KPMG Peat Marwick, said that "the complexity in this tax bill is across the board, not just in one area."
For those who prepare their own tax returns and want to take advantage of the breaks, doing so will mean more hours of work.
The 51 pages of instructions that the Internal Revenue Service wrapped around Form 1040 this year will grow a little for 1997 returns, and probably increase to more than 60 pages by the time the 1998 forms are mailed in January 1999, said Clint Stretch, director of tax legislative affairs for the accounting firm of Deloitte & Touche.
Some instructions will have to be revised annually, Mr. Stretch added, because a number of changes are being phased in over a period of years.
The Form 1040 itself, already tightly packed with detail, will have to be revised to take account of the $500-a-child credit and the college tuition credit, and to track money flowing through the new, nondeductible Super I.R.A.'s, from which all earnings can be withdrawn tax free at the age of 59 1/2.
Mr. Stretch and others said that there was not enough room to fit all the information onto the existing Form 1040 and that the I.R.S. would therefore probably create new schedules, which must be attached to the basic form, and additional work sheets so that only one or two new lines would be squeezed onto the 1040.
Schedule D, which is used to report capital gains, will have to be revised -- in keeping with a variety of tax rates that will apply, depending on how long the asset was held before sale -- and then revised again in coming years.
Mr. Ammerman, of KPMG Peat Marwick, said that by lowering capital gains rates while maintaining existing tax rates for other income, the new law would encourage schemes to turn ordinary income into capital gains.
"And that will spawn tax controversies," he said, "and the litigation will mean more regulations."
Intuit Inc., which publishes the Turbotax and Macintax software programs popular with individual taxpayers, sees opportunity in the need for pages of new instructions, new forms and complex calculations.
"Any time there is tax legislation our sales spike, because people fear changes in the tax law," said Bob Meighan, vice president of Intuit's personal tax group.
Intuit will seek new customers, Mr. Meighan said, by emphasizing how its software will simplify the complex calculations that the new law will require.
CCH, the nation's largest publisher of tax information, said no vacations would be allowed this month for 60 of its tax lawyers, who have been told that they will have to work through the weekends to update its books and manuals within 30 days of the bill's becoming law.
CCH expects to mail 8,500 new pages for clients to insert into its Federal Tax Service, an 18-volume loose-leaf guide for accountants that already runs 35,000 pages. Simply inserting the new pages will mean labor costs for its clients totaling about $59 million, figures from CCH show.
"Every time there is this kind of major tax change the tax professionals benefit more than anyone else, and we as publishers get a trickle-down benefit," said Arthur Rosano, director of marketing for CCH's tax compliance software, which is widely used by accountants.
Mr. Stretch, of Deloitte & Touche, said exceptionally complicated calculations would be required of the working poor who have more than two children and want to qualify for the earned-income tax credit.
"This is so difficult," Mr. Stretch said. "And people who are affected are not sophisticated about taxes. So maybe we will end up with court-appointed tax preparers to help the poor."
Michael Graetz, a professor of tax law at Yale who was a tax policy official in the Bush Administration, said he had slogged through the eligibility calculations for the earned-income tax credit and was "still not sure I understand them."
Professor Graetz said one outcome of this complexity might be that fewer of the working poor would take advantage of the credit.
The changes in the estate tax can save heirs several hundred thousand dollars, but they too come at a price, although a relatively small one.
"Everyone who owns a small business will need to rewrite their wills to make sure that their asset division between spouses" takes advantage of the new law, Professor Graetz said.
Tax simplicity, long promised by Republicans and championed by Representative Bill Archer, the Texas Republican who heads the House Ways and Means Committee, has nothing to do with this bill, observed Chris Burgin, the editor of the weekly magazine Tax Notes, which, to track the bill, has added between 25 and 50 pages to its usual 120 for the last six months.
"Ever since Bill Archer said he was going to tear the income tax out by its roots," Mr. Burgin said, "he has been fertilizing the tax code."
Mr. Burgin said the tax breaks for college educations would prove especially vexing for taxpayers.
"President Clinton said that the era of big government is over," he recalled. "But because we are financing breaks for college students through the tax code instead of the spending side, this bill will mean more regulations and more complexity. And that means more big government."
J. D. Foster, executive director of the Tax Foundation, said:
"The 1986 Tax Reform Act was designed to make things simple for individuals, but it was hell for corporations. The 1997 tax act makes things a lot simpler for corporations after a one-time transition, but for individuals it is hell -- although a voluntary hell, if they want to take advantage of its goodies -- because they will have to do a lot of work or pay financial planners and accountants and lawyers.
"The goodies are so good, though, that people will complain all the way to the bank."

HEADLINE: Target of Twin Broadsides on Corruption and Bombing, Arafat Goes to See Mubarak

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Aug. 2

 BODY:
Under fire from other Palestinians as well as from the Israeli Government, Yasir Arafat traveled to Egypt today to seek Arab backing against what he called "the dangerous measures" taken by Israel since a devastating suicide bombing Wednesday.
Israel has not yet carried out the most drastic steps threatened in response to the attack. But it has suspended plans for peace talks with the Palestinian Authority, arrested scores of people and demanded that Mr. Arafat, the Palestinian leader, crack down on militants -- even that he arrest his police chief in connection with a separate incident. 
 At a time when Mr. Arafat is also facing troubles over accusations of government corruption, his visit today to President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt was a quest for both support and redemption. Mr. Arafat has accused Israel of using the suicide bombing "to declare war on the Palestinian people, their national authority and their leadership, instead of declaring it against terrorism."
On Friday night, all but two of Mr. Arafat's 18 ministers offered to resign, saying they hoped that step would help him address the widening Palestinian resentment toward a government accused of mismanagement and financial improprieties. Most said, though, that they expected to remain at work in the weeks ahead as Mr. Arafat and his team struggle to cope with the crisis caused by the bombing, which has been attributed to Islamic militants.
Mr. Arafat has also called for the personal intervention of President Clinton to rescue the quest for a broader peace. The President's help has become "necessary in the current circumstances more than any other time before," he said.
Even before Mr. Arafat departed, Israel's Foreign Minister, David Levy, had dispatched official notes to his counterparts in Egypt, the European Community and the United States, urging that they press Mr. Arafat to crack down on militants.
The Israeli radio reported that Mr. Levy had complained to Foreign Minister Amr Moussa of Egypt about the lack of security cooperation between Israeli and Palestinian forces, calling it one of the factors that led to the bombing last week. Thirteen Israelis were killed, as well as the two bomb-laden men who committed suicide in the attack on a crowded Jerusalem produce market.
Videotape of some of the 79 arrests made by Israel in the two days after the attack has shown officers blindfolding Palestinian suspects and tying their hands behind their backs, then shepherding them into vans.
But to the evident frustration of Israeli officials, the attackers have not yet been identified. A spokesman for the Israeli Defense Force said this afternoon that no arrests had been made in connection with the bombing in the last 24 hours.
A pair of leaflets issued in the name of the militant Islamic group Hamas praised suicide attacks as the best tactic with which to confront Israel. One, issued Wednesday, warned of unspecified further action if Israel did not release Palestinian prisoners by 9 P.M. Sunday.
Israeli officials say that Hamas was responsible for the attack but that they are not yet certain that either leaflet was authentic. Nevertheless, Israel announced today that it was stepping up security all over the country.
An Israeli police spokeswoman said the warning in the leaflets of further action after 9 P.M. Sunday had been among the factors that had persuaded the authorities to bolster their security presence.
Mr. Netanyahu accused Mr. Arafat of doing precious little to halt such attacks, and Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai declared in a television interview Friday night that the Palestinians "need to meet their basic commitment to fight terror." Mr. Mordechai said Palestinian forces had begun to crack down to a certain extent but not yet with "full intensity."
In response, Saeb Erekat, a top Palestinian peace negotiator, said Friday night of Mr. Netanyahu, "Instead of declaring war on the enemies of peace, he has declared a war against the Palestinian people and the Palestinian Authority."
The Mubarak-Arafat meeting took place at the Egyptian leader's private residence near the Mediterranean coastal city of Alexandria. Mr. Mubarak, whose Government has played an important mediating role between the Israelis and the Palestinians, did not speak to reporters either beforehand or afterward. But an announcment on Egypt's state television, which almost always reflects Government policy, seemed to echo Mr. Arafat's critical language.
According to the announcement, the two Arab leaders "discussed the latest developments and the crisis that the peace process is going through, particularly after the dangerous decisions issued by the Israeli Cabinet in the wake of the explosions that took place in West Jerusalem."
In addition to making the arrests and halting plans for peace talks, Israel has sealed off the West Bank and Gaza Strip, threatening to send Israeli commandos into Palestinian-controlled areas to seize suspects.
On Thursday night, it also issued an arrest warrant for Gen. Ghazi Jabali, the Palestinian police chief for Gaza and the West Bank. General Jabali was not accused of involvement in the suicide bombings, the Government said in a statement, but of encouraging attacks on Jewish settlements. Israeli officials have said the general will be arrested if he enters Israeli territory, as he must if he is to travel from his headquarters in Gaza to perform his duties in the West Bank.
For several years, Israeli forces have generally respected Palestinian authority, and either the arrest of General Jabali or an incursion into Palestinian territory could bring about an utter collapse in relations between the two sides.
A planned trip to the Middle East by Dennis Ross, the American special mediator, was postponed after the bombing Wednesday, but Mr. Clinton said Friday that Mr. Ross would visit soon after Israel's weeklong period of mourning was over. He also held out the prospect that Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright would make her first trip to the Middle East since taking office.
But so far he has proposed nothing on the order of the summit meeting that the United States organized in the Egyptian resort of Sharm el Sheik in March 1996. A series of suicide bomb attacks in Israel brought leaders of some two dozen countries together there.
Today, the only clash between Israelis and Palestinians took place outside the site known as Rachel's Tomb in Bethlehem, where a Palestinian woman was arrested after reportedly trying to stab an Israeli soldier. The Israeli Defense Forces spokesman who reported the attack said the soldier had not been wounded.
Late Friday night, some of the Palestinian ministers who had offered their resignations suggested that they had been motivated by a desire to allow Mr. Arafat greater freedom in responding to the security crisis.
But ministers interviewed at greater length today made plain that they had been responding instead to criticism of governmental misconduct. This included a nonbinding but overwhelming 56-to-1 vote Thursday in the elected Palestinian Legislative Council giving Mr. Arafat one month to replace his cabinet.
"We really felt that the change was demanded and requested by the representatives of the people," Riad Zanoon, the minister of health, said in a telephone interview. Mr. Arafat has given no public hint of whether he will accept the resignations. Mr. Zanoon and others said Mr. Arafat had indicated that he would almost certainly postpone any decisions.
Mr. Arafat appeared to confirm that as he returned to Gaza today.
"There is still a long period," he said.
Among the cabinet members, only the planning minister, Nabil Shaath, and the information minister, Yasir Abed Rabbo, did not offer to resign. Mr. Rabbo dismissed the actions as "theatrical."
But those who did extend the offer included such well-known figures as Hanan Ashrawi, the minister for higher education, who said of Mr. Arafat in an interview that it was important "to free his hand so he can take the necessary decisions."
The most damning of the recent charges against the Palestinian Authority were contained in a report by a panel of the Palestinian Legislative Council. It included allegations of corruption and misuse of funds.
The evidence of apparent official corruption and mismanagement has added to resentment felt by Palestinians, many of whom suffer economic hardship. It has also embarrassed Mr. Arafat among donors, including the European Union and the United States, which have disbursed some $1.5 billion since the Palestinians reached a first accord with Israel in 1993.
Among Palestinians living in the West Bank and Gaza, there was praise for the ministers' offer to resign, mixed with skepticism. A Reuters dispatch quoted a Ramallah man, Yakub Jaarah, 60, as saying, "They are like thieves, and changing them would be very useful, but I do not believe that Arafat will replace them."

HEADLINE: YACHT RACING;
A Permanent Bond To the America's Cup

BYLINE: By BARBARA LLOYD 

DATELINE: NEWPORT, R.I.

 BODY:
It was an indelible introduction to the America's Cup for Don Smith, the chief benefactor in the New York Yacht Club's current effort to win back its revered old mug.
He is 52 now, a wealthy entrepreneur in alternative energy from Oklahoma City. But Smith was an impressionable senior at a private high school in Providence, R.I., when he had his first brush with the cup. 
 "I was wearing Bermudas and knee socks," he recalled of the memorable moment in 1962, "dressed in a way that would seem pretentious in those days. And I walked out on the dock at Bannister's Wharf here in Newport. A man with a badge and white shirt stopped me, and said, 'What are you doing here?'
"And I said, 'Why are you here, sir?' And he said, 'Because President Kennedy is coming over to view the yachts.' And I said, 'Well, that's good, let me through.' "
It was a defining moment, similar in its scope to President Clinton's chance encounter as a youth with President Kennedy. But instead of the politics that drew young Clinton, Smith bonded to the America's Cup.
But it wasn't until the summer of 1996 that Smith became a member of the New York Yacht Club. For one whose membership is still green, Smith has become a major player by way of funding -- as much as $4 million worth of cash and gear so far. New York's vehicle for trying to win the 146-year-old trophy from New Zealand in the year 2000 is the syndicate Young America, which has so far raised about one-third of its $40 million budget. Of the $20 million it hopes to find from private sources, about half has been pledged, including Smith's donation.
"It's an outrageous amount of money," he said of the costs of a cup campaign. "There's no way one can justify it from a social point of view that spending this much money is right for society. The only way we can justify it is through the pursuit of excellence, and magnificence, as a symbol of success. The America's Cup has always, always been won on the basis of technical innovation, every single time."
Smith's own contributions to the Young America campaign could top the $10 million mark. "Don't tell my wife," he quipped.
But, it was clear that Smith's wife, Vicky, already knew about his obsession. The yachting blood runs deep in Smith; after all, his grandfather was a prominent yachtsman from Rhode Island. And although Don, Vicky and their three children live on a ranch 40 miles outside of Oklahoma City, the family is used to his yachting forays.
He was here last week for the first day of boat testing between the club's two former America's Cup contenders: Young America, the 74-foot cup defender in 1995, and TAG Heuer, a New Zealand trial-race challenger that year. Both boats are outdated, but the syndicate is using them to try out new design ideas.
Smith's cup donations so far have gone largely to pay for the construction and upkeep of the new maxi-yacht, Falcon. The 80-foot sailboat is being used by the Young America syndicate as a competitive crew-training vessel. But the yacht is still mostly Smith's to use as he wants.
By donating Falcon to the syndicate, which is a nonprofit organization, Smith is eligible for a tax break. But if that were his purpose, he said, a corporate tax haven might have realized a far greater benefit.
The syndicate asked him to build a maxi rather than two 46-foot International Level Class yachts, as he had intended. The value of a maxi-yacht, he was convinced, would be in "experience, science, crew and a statement of their economic power."
As it turns out, Smith said, the decision was right. The 46-foot sailboat I.L.C. design he had expected to race competitively has waned in popularity in international yachting circles, whereas Falcon's size and power is similar to the 75-foot International America's Cup Class sailboats. Until Young America builds its own 1999-2000 cup yachts, Falcon has served its purpose, Smith said.
There is no mistaking Smith's purpose, or his commitment to it. "I want to win that cup," he said, his square jaw tightening and his eyes burning like lasers, "and I'm going to find a way to do it."

MAKING WAVES
 The American team took the lead yesterday in the Mumm Admiral's Cup after three days of racing off the Isle of Wight. JOHN KOLIUS, helmsman on MK Cafe in the I.L.C. 40 class, was first in the 30-hour Channel Race. Two other American boats finished second. The Americans lead with 33.75 points to 45.00 points for Britain and 51.50 for Germany. New Zealand is fourth with 54.38.

HEADLINE: A Reverse Discrimination Suit Upends Two Teachers' Lives

SERIES: A TEST OF FAIRNESS -- First of two articles.

BYLINE: By BRETT PULLEY 

DATELINE: PISCATAWAY, N.J.

 BODY:
The two women were brought together by a common desire to teach children. But they have been driven apart by race, politics and, paradoxically, a social policy that was supposed to help end such divisiveness.
For Sharon Taxman, it all began eight years ago, when the Piscataway Board of Education decided to eliminate one job in the high school business department. The one job was hers -- not because she was a poor teacher, the board reassured her. The sole reason, the board said, was that she was white. 
 Debra Williams, a business teacher as well, was hired the same day as Ms. Taxman. She kept her job, she learned, because she was black.
In early June 1989, about two weeks after the school board made its decision, Ms. Taxman filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and what started as a mundane school board budget and personnel matter quickly evolved into a subject of national debate.
Was this a case of an employer going too far in complying with laws intended to remedy past discrimination in the workplace? Or was this just an instance of a school board trying to make sure that its teaching staff reflected the racial diversity of the students?
The Bush Administration, which had been searching for cases that could help eliminate race-based preferences, seized on the Piscataway case in 1991 and sued the school district for discrimination. Earlier this summer, the Supreme Court announced that it would take up the case in its next term, and the Court may well use it to set new limits on the extent to which an employer can use race as a factor in making personnel decisions.
But regardless of the final Court ruling, the case has irrevocably changed the lives of Ms. Taxman and Ms. Williams. "You keep thinking, 'This might be a dream or something,' " Ms. Williams said. "But you wake up and it doesn't go away."
In the beginning, in the days after the board's decision, Ms. Taxman was primarily concerned that she had lost her job just as her oldest child, Michael, was about to go to the University of Wisconsin.
"The timing, for her purposes, was horrible," Ms. Taxman's lawyer, Stephen E. Klausner, said recently. "She wanted her job. She needed her job."
Ms. Taxman got her job back in 1993, after another teacher at the high school took an early retirement. But she has continued to sue for back pay for the two years when she was unemployed, even as she has reluctantly become a symbol of what has become known as reverse discrimination.
She has rejected legal assistance from conservative groups, which have rallied around her case, and she refuses to discuss her case with reporters, referring all questions to Mr. Klausner.
Even though she kept her job, Ms. Williams has found little comfort in it. The fact that her race was the only factor that mattered to the school board was unsettling.
"It hurt her self esteem," Ms. Williams's husband, Alvin, recalled. "With all that she had put into education, and then to be told that the only reason she has her job is because she's black."
Ms. Williams and Ms. Taxman have taught in adjoining classrooms and shared an office ever since Ms. Taxman was rehired in 1993. They share a telephone, and twice a month they sit alongside each other at departmental meetings. But, other teachers say, the two women rarely acknowledge each other's presence. They spoke to each other only once during the last school year, when Ms. Williams went into Ms. Taxman's classroom to help break up a fight between two students. "She thanked me," Ms. Williams recalled. "Other than that, she does not say a word. Not even 'Good morning.' "
Throughout the high school, some teachers have informally broken into cliques -- mostly along racial lines -- in support of either Ms. Williams or Ms. Taxman, some teachers say. And around town "there are some mixed emotions," said Jerry Mahoney, the current school board president.
"People feel strong about this," said Mr. Mahoney, a local police officer who was not on the board in 1989. But, he said, "There haven't been any negative things like people trying to force their opinions on others."
 
Integrated Town
Record of Diversity Intriguing to Court
Piscataway seems like an unlikely place to find racial turmoil. Situated in central New Jersey, about an hour's drive southwest of New York City, this racially diverse town of 47,000 people has long been sensitive enough about race that it holds a multicultural Fourth of July parade, and each school has an annual Diversity Day.
Before the 1960's, Piscataway was a farming community with no real identity of its own. But when Route 287 opened, housing and industry followed, and bit by bit suburban houses and industrial parks overtook most of the town's 20 square miles. Like many suburban towns in New Jersey that grew up in the last three decades, Piscataway has no central town or village. Of some 6,200 students in Piscataway's schools, about 50 percent are white, 30 percent are African-American, 10 percent are Asian and 5 percent are Hispanic. The racial and ethnic composition of the teaching staff in the district has long reflected the population.
Mr. Mahoney noted that even though the overall teaching staff was racially and ethnically diverse when Ms. Taxman was dismissed, the business staff at the high school was not. It was important to retain Ms. Williams, he said, because the board wanted to make the business department "more reflective of the student population."
Mr. Mahoney, who is black and grew up in Piscataway, said the town is fortunate not to have any racial problems. "I think that comes from having a lot of diversity," he said. "Every neighborhood in Piscataway is integrated."
But it is because Piscataway High School had no history of discrimination and because its overall teaching staff was already diverse that the Piscataway case has found its way to the Supreme Court.
The arguments before the Court will center on Title VII of the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964, which was intended to end discrimination in the workplace on the basis of race, religion, sex or national origin. Last August, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, which sits in Philadelphia, upheld a Federal District Court ruling that an employer may consider race in voluntary affirmative action only if it is used to remedy past discrimination or to correct distinctly low representation by minority workers in a traditionally segregated job category. The appeals court ruled that the Piscataway board did not meet either criterion, and that even if it had correctly identified a problem, terminating an employee would have been an extreme way to deal with it.
Some legal experts question whether the Piscataway case is the best test of affirmative action. They argue that although the district invoked its affirmative action policy, it was not intended to remedy any past discrimination.
 
Arrested Identity
Teacher Struggles For Recognition
Through the years, Ms. Williams has been on a crusade to prove her worth as an educator, constantly struggling to show that her qualifications, not her race, sustained her professionally. She keeps a file of papers, including diplomas, certificates and citations she has received, in her car. She even keeps handy a copy of the commencement program from her high school class in 1970, which shows that she graduated with honors.
During lunch at a local diner in July, the former Superintendent of the district, Philip Geiger, went over to Ms. Williams's table. "How's the Supreme Court?" he asked with a smile. "I got two A's on my courses at Rutgers last semester," she responded.
And although she is not an official party to the case, she has fought to keep the lawyers from ignoring her.
Mr. Klausner recalled an occasion, during oral arguments in Philadelphia, when Ms. Williams walked into the crowded courtroom and the marshal told her she would have to leave because there were too many people already inside. "She started yelling: 'This is my case. This is my case. I belong in this courtroom,' " Mr. Klausner said. "But this is not her case. She is nowhere to be found in this case as a litigant."
Ms. Williams says the board used her as a scapegoat to avoid making a tough personnel decision, and she insists that the board was wrong to determine that the only criterion distinguishing the teachers was race. "It really bothers me every time I pick up the paper and read that we had identical qualifications," Ms. Williams said. "We're not Siamese twins."
Indeed, while the courts may have deemed them equally qualified, the two women have distinctly different qualifications and backgrounds.
Ms. Taxman, a native of Buffalo, received a bachelor's degree in business education from the State University of New York at Buffalo. When she arrived at Piscataway in 1980, she was a 33-year-old mother of two children, whose first marriage had ended in divorce. She had taught high school courses for three years in upstate New York and had a comprehensive teaching endorsement that certified that she could teach a range of courses, including bookkeeping and accounting, business math and business English.
Ms. Williams, who was 28 years old when she started working in Piscataway, grew up in Winona, Miss. Her mother was a teacher and her father and grandfather funeral home operators. When the civil rights workers came through her hometown, her father opened his chapel to them, providing food and a place to stay.
She received her bachelor's degree in business education from Mississippi Valley State University in nearby Itta Bena. And it was there that she met her husband, who was president of his class and had led local civil rights marches himself. When the couple moved to New Jersey in the late 1970's, they had one son. They had another later.
Before teaching at Piscataway, Ms. Williams taught middle school for half a school year in Plainfield. Before that, she worked in administrative jobs at colleges in Mississippi. She was authorized to teach only secretarial studies and typewriting. But a year after joining the Piscataway staff, she received her master's in business education from Mississippi State University. And in 1985, she received her comprehensive certification, which allowed her to teach all the courses Ms. Taxman was certified to teach.
Ms. Williams was the first black teacher in the school's business education department, which in 1980 had 15 teachers. By 1989, because of declining enrollment, the department had just 10 teachers, and Ms. Williams was still the department's only black teacher. She is still the department's only black teacher.
From the start, the relationship between the two teachers was never more than cordial, and some teachers at the school recall that Ms. Taxman seemed withdrawn from many of her colleagues. But "it really wasn't unusual," said Priscilla Tucker, a former math teacher whose classroom was across the hall from Ms. Taxman's. "She was no different than a lot of other teachers who stay to themselves."
 
Icy Polarization
Serious Rift Comes With Long Debate
On April 24, 1989, a courier delivered letters to both Ms. Taxman and Ms. Williams in their classrooms. "The Board of Education will be discussing a reduction in the number of business teachers," said the letters from Gordon Moore, the school district's director of personnel. "This board discussion could possibly result in a recommendation to abolish a teaching staff position and terminate your employment."
On May 22, Ms. Taxman was told that she was out of a job.
The State of New Jersey requires that a reduction in force be done on the basis of seniority, and schools are allowed to use their own discretion only when there is a tie. In this instance, the school board followed a recommendation from the Superintendent and chose to invoke the district's affirmative action policy to break the tie.
As David B. Rubin, the lawyer representing the school board, explained, both teachers had received excellent evaluations and both had strong records of participation in related professional activities. "One may have had a master's and the other one didn't, and one may have had certifications the other one didn't," Mr. Rubin said. "But in all ways that mattered" the board deemed them to be equal.
On June 8, 1989, 16 days after the board told her she was terminated, Ms. Taxman filed a charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Over the coming months, while her complaint was under review, she looked for work and collected unemployment benefits, Mr. Klausner said.
When one teacher in the department went out on maternity leave in 1991, Ms. Taxman returned to her old job for a brief period. She was permanently rehired in 1993.
In the meantime, the two women had already gone before the State Commissioner of Education for a hearing, where Ms. Taxman argued that Ms. Williams had less seniority because she had used a large amount of leave when she gave birth to her second son and later suffered injuries in a car accident, all in the same school year. In 1990, the Commissioner ruled in Ms. Williams's favor, maintaining that they were equal in seniority.
But that same year, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission determined that there was "probable cause" to believe that the district had discriminated against Ms. Taxman. After the commission's determination reached the civil rights division of the Department of Justice, the case became a political matter.
In 1991, the Federal Government filed suit against the board. The Government was the principal plaintiff in the suit, joined by Ms. Taxman. In September 1993, a Federal District Court in Newark found in Ms. Taxman's favor and awarded her $144,000 in back pay. The school board appealed, and the White House, which by now was under the control of the Clinton Administration, tried to switch sides and support the school board's appeal.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit denied the Administration's request, but allowed the Government to withdraw from the case. In August 1996, the appeals court upheld the lower court's ruling, which led to the Supreme Court appeal.
As the debate has continued, the rift between the two teachers has widened. Ms. Tucker, who retired this year, said she was friendly with both teachers, but found it difficult to be around them at the same time. "I noticed that when I'm with Debbie, Sharon doesn't speak," Ms. Tucker said. "But when I'm not with Debbie, she's very friendly."
On one occasion, the department supervisor tried to clear the air by calling the two into his office to shake hands. Even though they agreed, the gesture apparently held no lasting meaning. Ms. Tucker said that she noticed "a kind of polarization that occurred as a result of the case" and that Ms. Taxman "has become very friendly with a group of teachers, and they shun other groups of teachers." A district official denied that there was any added tension in the school as a result of the case.
But, teachers at the schools say, Ms. Williams is criticized by some of her colleagues who imply that she should just be happy to have her job. "My close friends, eating buddies, say things about her," Ms. Tucker admitted. "People are aware of the case and they talk about the nature of why Debbie was kept as a teacher and Sharon was not. But that was not Debbie's doing. She's not responsible for being born black, and she's not responsible for the board's decision. She's trying to defend herself when she shouldn't have to defend herself."
To be sure, the case has made life more complicated and stressful for both teachers.
Ms. Taxman, her lawyer said, "is not clinically depressed, but she is depressed."
Ms. Williams is careful about what classes she allows her youngest son, a 10th-grade student at Piscataway, to take. "I select his teachers, because I know that some might be prejudiced because of the case," she said.
It has also affected her health. She doesn't sleep well and her blood pressure is high. "Every day, she comes home all twisted up," Alvin Williams said of his wife. "Why do you have to pay such a price for a job?"
Mr. Williams said he has told his wife: "You have both been judged by the color of your skin. This situation violates the principle that civil rights stand on. The board did both of you wrong. You both have been used. You should be teamed up, together."
NEXT: In the coming Supreme Court debate, one Justice will be on the spot.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL: NOTEBOOK;
Next Up in Reinsdorf's Great Chicago Fire Sale: Ventura to Yanks?

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
Jerry Reinsdorf, a general manager was saying the other day, has done two things that have not been good for baseball. Other people in baseball, union officials, for example, would suggest that Reinsdorf, the Chicago White Sox owner, has done many more things that have not been good for baseball, but the general manager was speaking of two specific things.
"Signing Albert Belle was one," he said. "Doing this is not good for baseball either." 
 "This" was the startling trade the White Sox made with the San Francisco Giants last Thursday, the one by which the White Sox announced to the rest of the baseball world and their fans that with a third of the season still to be played they were putting their bats and balls in mothballs for the winter.
"It's the Major League Baseball version of 'no mas,' " an owner of another team remarked.
By giving the Giants their No. 1 starting pitcher (Wilson Alvarez), their closer (Roberto Hernandez) and another veteran pitcher (Danny Darwin) for six minor leaguers, only one of whom is considered a top prospect, the White Sox signaled surrender when they were only three and a half games behind Cleveland in the American League Central.
If there is something beyond unconditional surrender, though, the White Sox may do that, too, by trading Robin Ventura, their recuperated third baseman, to the Yankees. After talking with the St. Louis Cardinals about Ventura last week -- "at length," an official of another club said -- the White Sox have continued speaking with the Yankees, another official said.
"There might be a deal with the Yankees in the next week or two if they can get Ventura through waivers," the official said.
Because the July 31 deadline has passed, anyone who is traded now must clear waivers first. Ventura, 30 years old, missed the first 99 games this season with a broken right leg and a severely dislocated ankle, but since returning July 24 he has batted .379 in eight games.
If the Yankees were to get the four-time Gold Glove winner, they could use Charlie Hayes as a right-handed-hitting designated hitter, now considered a problem area because of the injury to Cecil Fielder. Ventura has a $6 million salary this season, and his contract includes a club option at $6.1 million for next year. Trading Ventura would no longer come as a surprise, considering what the White Sox have already done with some of their higher-priced players.
The Chicago fire sale was not what Reinsdorf had in mind when he threw $55 million, $11 million a year, at Albert Belle, last November and single-handedly escalated the salary scale by the largest dollar leap ever. Concerned about lagging attendance and decreasing revenue, Reinsdorf believed that the addition of Belle would make the team a contender that would attract hundreds of thousands of additional fans.
The fans' anger with the White Sox, though, evidently runs deeper than the game's richest contract can dissolve. After drawing an average crowd of 21,220 last season, the White Sox have averaged 24,050 this season, an increase far below what Reinsdorf had in mind.
The Belle signing, then, has failed on one narrow economic front, in that it didn't achieve Reinsdorf's goal. But it has been devastating in a broader economic way. It forced other clubs to give their star players much more money than they otherwise would have had to pay them: the Giants gave Barry Bonds $11.45 million a year for two years; Sammy Sosa got $10.62 million a year for four years from the Cubs; Gary Sheffield received $10.17 million a year for six years from the Marlins and the Rangers signed Ivan Rodriguez for $8.4 million a year for five years.
"It had a tremendous impact; there's no question," Dave Dombrowski, the Florida Marlins' general manager, said, discussing Sheffield's contract. "They didn't want to talk at all until Belle signed. Once the Belle numbers came in, they were very open to talk. I said this might be an aberration. Then the Bonds numbers came in and the market was defined. So it had a tremendous impact."
Until Belle signed, the highest annual average value was $8.5 million for Ken Griffey Jr.
"That was a very easy number to justify," Dombrowski said, "because Griffey was a complete-package player. In our initial discussions, we weren't prepared to go above that."
Andy MacPhail, the Cubs' president, said that the Belle contract affected their negotiations with Sosa, too. "We weren't interested in any five- or six-year contract," MacPhail said. "We were willing to make a concession on the average annual value to keep it four."
Doug Melvin said that the Rangers' difficulty in signing Rodriguez, which they finally succeeded in doing last week, stemmed from Belle's double digits and those that followed.
"The whole negotiation was 'if Belle, Sheffield and Sosa can get $10 million,' " the Texas general manager said. "That's what we were faced with."
Reinsdorf was not available at the end of the week to comment on the ramifications of the Belle contract or the club's shredding of its roster.
"Jerry will not be able to return a call today," his assistant, Anita Fasano, said, adding that he would then be away for a week.
Reinsdorf, who has been very discouraged and has constantly complained about the attendance at Comiskey Park, had been quoted earlier in the week as saying, "Anyone who thinks this White Sox team will catch Cleveland is crazy." Is the newly constituted White Sox team capable of catching the Indians? Not in this millennium.
Defending the team's trades -- Harold Baines was also traded last week, to Baltimore -- General Manager Ron Schueler said: "I gave them 102 games to compete and we weren't even at .500. If we got lucky, we might contend for the division. There wouldn't be anything after that. I don't see where we threw in the towel."
Some baseball people, upon hearing about the White Sox-Giants trade, immediately thought of the deals Bowie Kuhn, then the commissioner, wouldn't let Charlie Finley of Oakland make in the middle 1970's. Finley, however, wanted to shred his roster mostly for cash.
Bud Selig, the acting commissioner, was asked about Chicago's roster-shredding trades.
"In this particular situation," he said, choosing his words carefully, "every club has to make their own individual decisions. Obviously, the White Sox, I'm sure, thought this out very well and decided this was the direction they wanted to go."
A high-ranking executive of another club questioned how well thought out that direction was.
"If you have a strategy and stick with it, ultimately you will be rewarded," the veteran executive said. "They were three games out and didn't let the strategy follow through. When you switch strategies in midstream, it's going to create problems."
 
Intriguing Moves in Seattle
 If the White Sox trade was the most shocking made on deadline day for trades without waivers, the Mark McGwire trade from Oakland to St. Louis was the most predictable and the Seattle Mariners' trades the most curious.
"The Jose Cruz thing knocked everyone's socks off; he's such a good- looking player," one general manager said, referring to the trade of Cruz Jr., a rookie outfielder, to Toronto for two relief pitchers, Mike Timlin and Paul Spoljaric. "The only guy I think they could have given up Cruz for was Ricky Bottalico. Everybody I talked to said the same thing."
Lee Thomas, the Philadelphia general manager, said that the Mariners talked to him about Bottalico but did not offer Cruz.
"It never got that far," Thomas said. "There was a lot of sparring around about him, but it was never, 'I'll do it, will you do it?' "
The Mariners, desperate for a closer, apparently wanted one from the American League so he would be familiar with A.L. hitters. But they got Timlin, who had lost his closing job with the Blue Jays to a rookie, Kelvim Escobar, and in a second trade, Heathcliff Slocumb, who minutes before the trade squandered yet another save and cost Boston a victory.
The Mariners also talked to the White Sox about Roberto Hernandez but didn't offer Cruz. "I don't know if that would have got it done," said Ron Schueler, who included the team's solid closer in the San Francisco package.
 
Garner's Magic Act
 Taking nothing away from Terry Collins of the surprising Anaheim Angels, Phil Garner of the Milwaukee Brewers should be named the American League manager of the year right now.
Despite injuries to some of his key players and far less talent than many teams, Garner has the Brewers playing like a division contender. They entered last night's game with a nine-game winning streak, sitting only two and a half games behind Cleveland in the A.L. Central.
During the winning streak, Garner's guys pulled off perhaps the most remarkable team feat of the season. They won doubleheaders from Toronto on consecutive days, sweeping a four-game series in 48 hours.
 
Realignment Gains Momentum
 Despite some reluctance, teams seem to be moving toward major realignment of the leagues. At a realignment committee meeting last week, a vote on the most radical plan, one that would shift just about half of the teams, was 12-2 in favor.
Atlanta and San Diego voted no, but an owner of another team said the Braves and the Padres support "significant" realignment but questioned parts of the proposed plan.
The committee doesn't have to make a recommendation unanimously. However, any team that would be asked to change leagues can veto the move. The Players Association is also expected to oppose radical realignment.

Olympic Wrestler's Silver Medal Has Brought Little in Value

BYLINE: By HARVEY ARATON 

 BODY:
ALMOST everywhere he has gone for a full year now, no one has cared or even remembered that Matt Ghaffari came in second. An embarrassingly dumb corporate slogan from last summer's Atlanta Olympics claimed that you "don't win silver, you lose gold," but Ghaffari's tears as the silver medal for Greco-Roman wrestling was placed around his ample neck represented how far he had come, not where he had failed to go.
An escape from the upheaval in late-1970's Iran. Nine knee operations. Years of financial sacrifice by him and his wife. He had a story to tell, and suddenly, amazingly, he had a platform from which to tell it. 
 Ghaffari told Jay Leno he thought only "gold medalists get to sit on your couch," but Leno didn't care that he came in second. The Republican National Convention, which he addressed last August, didn't mind that he finished in exactly the same position that Bob Dole was going to. The daughter of the woman killed in the Centennial Park bombing knew Ghaffari from his visits to her hospital bedside as her Olympic angel, with a heart of gold.
Everywhere he has gone for a full year now, 36-year-old Matt Ghaffari, out of Paramus High School in New Jersey, has worn his silver medal with pride, with hope. Everywhere, it seems, but the bank.
"I went to try to get financing for my house, which I rent with an agreement to buy," he said recently from his home outside Cleveland. "They asked for tax statements for the last 10 years and say, 'What have you been doing for the last few years?' I tell them, 'I was training for the Olympics.' Then they say, 'That means you were unemployed.' "
The bankers have not wanted to know how he rejected the chance to wrestle at the 1988 Olympics for Iran after failing to make the United States team. How he closed a car park-and-lease business in Phoenix, and his wife quit her job with an insurance firm to accompany him to Colorado Springs, so he could train for 1996. In tax-code speak, he is nothing more than a runner-up to a Russian, Aleksandr Karelin. Sorry, the bankers have said, we can't help you.
It became frustrating for Ghaffari to hear through the wrestling grapevine what became of Karelin, who finished the Atlanta Games unbeaten for almost a decade. "I was told he was a colonel in the army and they made him a three-star general," Ghaffari said. "They had a parade for him in Red Square. He's a millionaire now. He walks with two bodyguards."
This could be apocryphal. Karelin didn't seem the type who needed protection. At 6 feet 4 inches and 300 pounds, he walked with a menacing strut and brooding, deep-set eyes under blond, peach-fuzz hair. In wrestling circles, he was sometimes referred to as the World's Meanest Man.
Ghaffari also knew Karelin as something of a humanitarian, a statesman, so respected that a campaigning Boris Yeltsin was said to have visited the wrestler at his Siberian home, 1,750 miles from Moscow, to seek his endorsement.
Upon winning his medal, Ghaffari patterned himself after Karelin, becoming the Leonard Zelig of the United States team. No photo opportunity could go off without him. No little old lady could cross the street without him on her arm. Instead of a party week on the United States Olympic Committee, he gave his time to the Paralympics. He made the acquaintance of other bombing victims. In the months ahead, his reward would be a job as a sort of lounge act sports celebrity. He would crisscross America, weaving a tangled web of fund-raising dinners and golf.
"Never played in my life, but I just had to go out and actually buy a set of clubs," he said.
People like him, he said. They listen to his story, even if they think Greco-Roman might be a sport played with shields and clubs. But in the year since the Olympics, he has earned between $30,000 and $40,000, not enough to support three young daughters, not even enough to borrow from a bank. He thinks he could have been a star, but knows now that corporate America is too busy throwing millions at bratty teenagers and Dennis Rodman to use imagination and bankroll some likable athletes who actually deserve it.
From last summer, it is his understanding that the swimmer Amy Van Dyken made out great. The gymnast Kerri Strug thought she could be a solo act, but how much limping by a nutritionally challenged young woman can an audience stand? At least she had her teammates to vault back to, to go on tour with. At least the women's basketball players now have not one, but two, professional leagues of their own.
As for Ghaffari's career, the 2000 Sydney Games are too far away. He injured his knee helping one of the wrestlers he works with part time at Cleveland State University, his alma mater. And this life on the road is getting old.
He just got home from appearances in Idaho and Minneapolis. This week, he's in Baltimore, home for two days, off to Denver. His wife calls him an "absentee father," which upsets him. He worries about health insurance for his girls. He knows his one-year ride, Matt Ghaffari's silver surfing, is coming to an end.
"It's back to changing diapers and taking the garbage out," he said, with a sigh. "I need to get a real job."

HEADLINE: Middle Class Shouldn't Be Singing the Blues

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Your editorial and David Frum's Op-Ed on the budget agreement (July 30), though written from different ideological vantage points, correctly agree that the middle class fares badly under the deal. 
 Congress and President Clinton will be remembered for their "courage" in lowering taxes while raising spending during a time of economic growth. They will also be remembered for postponing the hard decisions. Not only are deficits likely to return in the next century, but also the behavior of leaders from both parties gives little reason to expect the entitlement reform you envision.

HEADLINE: Surging Economy Vindicates Supply-Side Claims

 BODY:

To the Editor:
In your Week in Review piece "The Supply Side's Irrepressible Charm" (July 27), you avoid the tiresome arsenal of myth, caricature and falsehood that critics usually roll out in an effort to discredit President Reagan's economic policies. Instead, you opt for the slightly bemused, dismissive approach of one commenting affectionately on the foibles and crankiness of a dotty old aunt. Cute, but intellectually vacuous. 
 You dismiss as hysterical the warnings that President Clinton's 1993 tax increase would damage the economy and observe that today, "the economy is robust." The fact is, the supply-side criticism of the Clinton tax increase, as well as of the increase under President Bush, was right on the mark. It took the economy seven years to completely digest the impact of these tax increases. If not for the increases, the gross domestic product would now be at least 11 percent bigger than it is and the large deficits of the early 1990's would never have occurred.
You give credence to the flawed philosophy that tax increases improve the economy by lowering the deficit, thus lowering interest rates. This mixes up cause and effect. As the past year has made clear, the rapidly vanishing deficit is the result of the robust economy, not vice versa.
You say my suggestion that Africa could foster entrepreneurship by reducing taxes ignores the fact that few of Africa's poor, or its wealthy, pay their taxes. Let me make a simple point. Most Africans will never pay taxes as long as rates are prohibitively high. Since people don't pay taxes under high tax rates anyway, why are you so afraid to lower the rate?
I assure you, if rates were lowered (in conjunction with a free-trade zone, stable monetary policies and foreign-investment programs with a focus on privatization) revenues would grow, as they did in America under John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan.

HEADLINE: Surging Economy Vindicates Supply-Side Claims;
A Fiscal Theory Only Orwell Could Love

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Your July 27 Week in Review article on the remarkable durability of supply-side economics describes supply-siders as "offering the somewhat tortured argument that the economy would be even stronger if not for the 1993 tax increase." Actually, they're more imaginative than that: the same people who predicted disaster four years ago are now insisting, with straight faces, that the nation's prosperity is -- guess what? -- a confirmation of their doctrine. 
 Consider, for example, the columnist Paul Craig Roberts, who once warned that a Clinton tax increase would produce "a bigger deficit, higher unemployment, rising inflation and a currency crisis to boot" -- but who recently wrote a column titled "What's So Mysterious About the Rip-Roaring Economy?" proclaiming that plunging deficits, low unemployment, stable prices and a surging dollar are exactly what supply-side economics predicted.
Or check out the editorial in Investor's Business Daily titled "The Supply-Sider's Revenge" declaring the decline in the deficit a vindication of Ronald Reagan's 1981 tax cut. (Applying the same time lag, we might surmise that credit for the economic turnaround of 1982 belongs not to Mr. Reagan but to Lyndon B. Johnson.)
So while some supply-siders are claiming credit for a healthy economy, others are using the standard tricks of statistical distortion to claim that it isn't that healthy after all. But as George Orwell could have told you, absolute commitment to a doctrine always requires not just the willingness to rewrite history but a talent for double-think: the ability to believe two contradictory things at the same time.

HEADLINE: The Irish and Their Montauk Connection

BYLINE: By RICK MURPHY 

 BODY:
THE brogue is heard in delis, video stores and fish markets, spoken by house cleaners, landscapers and bartenders.
It's not Dublin. But with the throngs of Irish men and women who have flocked to the East End, it might seems that way. 
 Many are linked to one family in East Hampton, Brian and Prudence Carabine. The Carabines say they have "networked" 1,500 young Irish people in 15 years, taking them into their home or finding work and lodging for them.
"There were so many people coming here at one point that if the cops found kids with Irish accents sleeping on the beach they would automatically bring them to our house," Ms. Carabine said.
The Carabines began housing Irish students in 1983, charging a small amount for food and a bed.
"I grew up with parents that did what they could for other people," Ms. Carabine said. "That's just the way it was."
Her family settled in East Hampton in the 17th century. She ran a work agency in the 80's and sought out Irish students to fill jobs.
Mr. Carabine's parents hailed from Ireland. "They always stressed hospitality," he said. That's what we do here."
As visitors returned and told others about their summers, they passed along the Carabines' telephone number. Each summer, more called.
"It got out of hand," Ms. Carabine recalled. "One night Brian came home for supper, and there were 42 of us at the table."
Naomi Corbett-Kelsall has been spending part of each year in the Hamptons since her first visit 11 years ago. She attributed the large numbers of her countrymen who have migrated here to liberal immigration between the two countries.
The Hamptons are particularly appealing, Ms. Corbett-Kelsall said, because the area has many decent-paying summer jobs. In her case, a help-wanted sign at the Irish consulate in Manhattan that she saw shortly after her arrival was the impetus.
"Chamber maids wanted in Montauk," it read. "We all looked at each other and asked, 'Where's Montauk?' " she recalled.
That job did not pan out, and before long Ms. Corbett-Kelsall found her way to the Carabines.
"Most every one of us who have been out here have done a stint on a mattress on Prudie's floor," she said.
Ms. Corbett-Kelsall met her husband in East Hampton, and for five years has returned to work at Jeff's Fancy Produce, a greengrocer. She returns to Ireland with her husband each winter.
Another Carabine alumna, Pat Lillis, took a break from teaching in Ireland eight years ago to vacation in East Hampton. And she has stayed.
"The people are so civilized when it comes to animals here," Ms. Lillis said. "There are a lot of animal lovers. I found it difficult to live in Ireland because it's not the case there. Here if you find an injured critter you can find some help for it."
She works cleaning houses and watching pets.
"I like to say I'm in A & E, anything and everything," she added.
Anne-Louise Kieran, an art student in a college in Glasgow who was born in Northern Ireland, is spending her first summer in the Hamptons along with her boyfriend, Julian Kildear.
"I'm the third member of my family to come here," Ms. Kieran said. "We just said, 'Let's drop everything and have a life experience in the Hamptons.' "
She said she had mixed feelings about her summer.
"I have a love-hate relationship with America. I don't think I could live here permanently. It's too big. It's too fast. There is an incredible work ethic. But the big thing is being here by the ocean. It's just incredible."
Both students had heard that the Hamptons were a hot spot for celebrities. Sure enough, Ms. Kieran was in line at a store when she encountered Jamie Lee Curtis. "She seemed very nice," Ms. Kieran said.
"The cost of living here is quite a bit higher than at home," Mr. Kildear said. "We still haven't figured out this whole tipping thing. We get paranoid when we're in a restaurant trying to figure out how much."
The Carbines have made several trips to Ireland after having heard so much about the country.
"It's amazing," Mr. Carabine said. "We've been walking across a bridge and met people we've had in our house."
"It's almost impossible for us to go into a pub in Dublin without seeing someone we know," Ms. Carabine said. "In our little way we've made the world smaller."
Because of an abundance of hotel and restaurant jobs in Montauk, it remains a hot spot for visiting students. Many gather at the Old Shebeen tavern. Occasionally the police said, the rowdy crowds cause vandalism and commit petty crimes, but for the most part the students are well behaved.
"The Irish people like to work hard and they like to play hard," Ms. Corbett-Kelsall said.
"We're friendly. We talk to everyone and accept everyone," Ms. Lillis said. "People hear an Irish accent and they know they aren't going to get killed. They trust Irish people."
Many Irish visitors have stayed in the United States and found high-paying jobs, because, Ms. Corbett-Kelsall said, they are highly educated, and Ireland is one of the most computer-literate countries.
Ms. Kieran's brother is a computer programmer in Pittsburgh.
But Mr. Carabine said now that the Irish economy had improved, more and more former borders are heading home.
Although Ms. Lillis calls East Hampton her "home away from home," Mr. Carabine said that for many borders "there is only one real home."
"You can spend a lifetimelooking for those kinds of roots and never find them," Mrs. Carabine said.
Visitors from Ireland are hardly a new phenomena in America, but Ms. Corbett-Kelsall traces the latest influx from visa agreements that the two countries forged in 1968.
"A lot of students use these visas as a steppingstone," especially in the summer, she said, to travel freely on school vacations.
Groups of students, who arrive in New York, are accompanied by coordinators to help them through the first few days.
The arrangers frequently provide temporary lodging, and the students are told "to pound the streets and find work," Ms. Corbett-Kelsall said.
But even if New York City is the destination of choice for many, "you quickly realize accommodations are out of the question," she said.
After the first wave settled on the East End, the gates opened.
"The Hamptons are well known in Ireland," Ms. Corbett-Kelsall said. "We have contacts here. We are a very close-knit community, and we bond. I would do things for Irish people in East Hampton I wouldn't do for them at home. It's become a summer phenomena."
Though certainly a popular settling point, The Hamptons is not the only place to welcome visitors from across the sea. Ms. Kieran spent her first summer abroad in San Francisco. Martha's Vineyard is another popular locale. This year, a large group of students went to tiny Block Island.
More than a few visitors, like Ms. Lillis, have permanently settled in the Hamptons. Several own businesses, including a seafood store, an upholstery shop and a deli.
"Obviously, they are predisposed to hiring Irish," Ms. Corbett-Kelsall pointed out.
For 10 years the sluggish European economy has fueled a major move to find work abroad. But with the European economy regaining now, Mr. Carabine said, he sees signs that the flow of Irish visitors may have peaked.
The family receives fewer calls and takes in fewer boarders, offering beds only to those with family connections. The Carabines' children, like their parents, have all visited Ireland and stayed at the Kierans' home.
Mr. Kildear said that more and more Irish students were choosing to stay in Europe. There are more jobs, he said, and, "It's fashionable to be Irish all over Europe these days, even in Britain."

HEADLINE: Civic Pride Aside, Some Economists Say, Costly Sports Stadiums May Not Be Worth It

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

DATELINE: ALBANY, Aug. 2

 BODY:
Have New York and Los Angeles been wounded by the loss of their National Football League teams? Have Indianapolis and Jacksonville, Fla., been reinvigorated by gaining such teams? Is civic pride reason enough to invest tens -- or hundreds -- of millions of dollars to keep a profit-making sports team from fleeing?
New York State lawmakers have rekindled interest in such questions by agreeing to invest $75 million from the state budget in the improvement of Rich Stadium to keep the Buffalo Bills from leaving the state. In an era when sports teams have perfected the dance to get hold of tax dollars, threatening to jump cities unless they are given lavish new homes at public expense, many cities have debated the merits of giving in to such demands. 
 It is an immediate concern in New York City, where George M. Steinbrenner 3d, principal owner of the Yankees, has threatened to leave town when the team's lease at Yankee Stadium expires in 2002 and the Mets, too, are eager to build a new home. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has supported the idea of building the Yankees a new home, for $1 billion, above a rail yard west of Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan.
But many economists who have studied the issue have concluded that cities and states almost never gain by giving in to teams' demands for new stadiums.
"Any politician who says this is sound economic development is either misinformed or lying," said Andrew Zimbalist, a professor of economics at Smith College who is writing a book on the subject with Roger Noll of the Brookings Institution.
Sports teams produce little or no net increase in economic activity in a city, critics contend: rather, they take away money from other forms of entertainment, like eating out or going to the movies.
And, the critics argue, an investment of hundreds of millions of dollars in a new stadium is far out of proportion to the meager commerce the stadium would, by itself, produce.
Robert Baade, an economist at Lake Forest College in Illinois, said it is not worth the effort. "And," he said, "when you take into account that the money spent on a stadium could be invested in roads or bridges or industrial parks or schools, all of which have much greater return, it may well be that stadium-building actually has a negative economic impact."
Despite such arguments, elected officials routinely refer to spending to keep sports teams as an important form of economic development.
Trumpeting the Bills' deal in Buffalo on Thursday, Gov. George E. Pataki, said, "We will do what Los Angeles, Cleveland and Houston could not: hold onto our N.F.L. team in this era of franchise free agency."
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan has introduced legislation that could make city-hopping harder for teams by barring local and state governments from using tax-exempt bonds to build sports arenas.
Analysts say that a project like Buffalo's, which merely upgrades an existing stadium with luxury boxes and other amenities, is less of a boondoggle than building an entirely new stadium. But the Buffalo deal obligates the Bills to stay for only one to six years, depending on a number of factors, though there would be financial penalties for leaving before 14 years.
In general, analysts say, a baseball team is a better investment for a city than a football team because a baseball team plays 81 home games a year in the regular season, as compared with the 8 home games played in football.
Economists note that a major sports team has only about 100 full-time, year-round employees, and while several hundred more may work at the stadium during the season, most are in low-paying jobs and work only on game days or during special events like concerts.
Politicians have been known to fear being tarred as the one who lost a team, but history provides little evidence that elected officials pay a political price for standing up to team owners and watching them leave.
In New York, Mayors Edward I. Koch and Robert F. Wagner were handily re-elected after sports teams departed for newer arenas, and the same holds true in Los Angeles for Mayors Tom Bradley and Richard Riordan.
"When cities go to great lengths to keep these teams, I think it's all about a municipal macho," said State Senator Franz S. Leichter, a Manhattan Democrat. "And that's just not a good enough reason."

HEADLINE: SOFTWARE;
Professor Higgins Would Be Pleased

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD; Matthew L. Wald is a reporter in the Washington bureau of The New York Times.

DATELINE: CLEVELAND HEIGHTS, Ohio

 BODY:
From the computer's speakers came a well-modulated American male voice with perfect diction, delivering "model utterances" to a Chinese student. The phrases were nothing like those in a Berlitz course for tourists or in a high school language textbook; these were designed for college professors, doctors, executives and other professionals.
 "Your college transcripts are absolutely confidential," the voice said. It continued with other sentences: "She has office hours in the morning. Specifically, do you know which algorithms are causing problems? We have no doubts that the software is pirated." And, "Sign these checks." 
 The program, developed by Arthur H. Schwartz, a speech pathologist, is an advanced example of a growing effort on campuses and in businesses nationwide to teach not English, but English pronunciation.
 Learning to speak any language exactly like a native becomes impossible for most people after the age of 12, and thus nearly everyone who learns English as an adult lacks the ability to pronounce some of its consonants. But according to Dr. Schwartz and others, Asians generally find English harder than Europeans do, because most Asian languages lack the patterns of stress and intonation that impart much of the meaning in spoken English.
 Another reason for the Asian emphasis is that what used to be called the "brain drain" is still operating, drawing a torrent of professionals to the United States -- more and more of them from Taiwan, Korea, Japan and China. Programs that work on pronunciation have sprung up in places ranging from Honolulu to Stillwater, Okla., as well as Cincinnati, Boston, Syracuse and traditional centers of immigration like the New York City area. According to the United States Census Bureau, more than 200,000 people arrive in the United States from Asia and the Pacific Islands every year.
 An example is Oliver Wong, the student seated at Dr. Schwartz's computer. A physician at the Cleveland Clinic, Dr. Wong, 35, arrived from Hong Kong six years ago with both an M.D. and a Ph.D. in nuclear medicine. Staring intently at the computer's screen, he tried saying, "Sign these checks." What he saw on the monitor was a voiceprint of the "model," showing the pitch and volume of each sound. Below it was a print of his own effort.
 Dr. Wong did well with the "n" in "sign," which is often a problem for Chinese students, who tend to drop final consonants. He also pronounced the "th" in "these" correctly, another tricky area, because Chinese students sometimes produce the sound without using their vocal cords, so it resembles the whispery "th" in "think."
 But Dr. Wong, who is one of Dr. Schwartz's most advanced students, found the real value of the computer-based system in the last word, "checks." For Dr. Wong, it had come out "chess."
 Dr. Schwartz pointed at the voiceprint of the sample utterance and the print of Dr. Wong's effort. "Did you have a match for the word ending?" he asked, indicating the thin squiggle, which represented the "s" sound, at the end of the print.
 Yes," said Dr. Wong, but he frowned at the screen. Something else was wrong, he knew, but like many students, he was having trouble identifying his error.
 "Was it the 'ch' sound?" he asked. But no, that was fine. Then he looked near the end of the voiceprint. In the model there was a tiny gap, representing silence, between the main body of the word and the ending "s," but in the print of his voice, there was no such gap.
 "There's a 'k' sound; I missed the 'k' sound," he said.
 Then Dr. Wong moved on to the sentence about college transcripts. Dr. Schwartz congratulated him on correctly producing the last vowel sound in "confidential," and the "ts" in transcripts. Getting those correct made his whole sentence easy to understand, even though he missed the "p" in "transcripts."
 Dr. Wong, who was born in Fujian Province and thus speaks two Chinese dialects in addition to English, said: "In Chinese, when you're done with one vowel, you're done with that particular word. We don't depend on consonants that much." But in English, he said, "you need to master several vowels and consonants in one word."
 Dr. Schwartz is a professor of speech and hearing at Cleveland State University, where several faculty members had referred graduate students to him for remedial work. That prompted him to found a small company, Accent Services, USA, and begin teaching students on the side, like Dr. Wong. His goal, he said, is not to produce students who sound just like Americans, but to help people make enough of the sounds that the listener expects so that their speech will be clear, or at least intelligible. As an example, he gave the word "parallel."
 An Asian-born speaker trying to produce the word "parallel" might miss one sound, and say something like "pawallel," but that would still be intelligible, Dr. Schwartz said. Missing a second sound might still work, he said. "The listener is willing to work to fill in one, or to struggle for two," he said. But if the speaker missed a third sound, a native-born American would say, "the hell with it," Dr. Schwartz said.
 SOME academic institutions have found that out the hard way. Syracuse University, for example, now runs a course in English pronunciation for foreign-born teaching assistants. Jeanette D. Macero, who teaches the course, said the genesis was complaints from parents that they were paying tuition for instructors whom their children could not understand.
 Now, she said, "We have rankings, one to four." One is near-native speaking; two is very good; three is someone who needs help, and four is "needs a great deal of help," she said.
 "In order to teach, everybody needs to be a two," she said. "Eighty-five percent of all students become a two by the end of the second semester, and most of the remainder are a two by third semester."
 In addition to English pronunciation, the course also teaches instructors that if they do not understand a question raised by an undergraduate, they should ask to have the question repeated. Female teachers from countries in which women do not raise their voices are taught to speak more firmly, and teachers of both sexes are taught a mixture of rhythm, intonation and melody (called prosody) that is characteristic of English. In Chinese, for example, tones give meanings to individual words but not to whole sentences. In English, tone differentiates a question from a declarative statement and also shows emphasis.
 Foreign students at Syracuse and other colleges are given carefully graded tests of spoken English. The Educational Testing Service, in Princeton, N.J., developed a Test of Spoken English in 1981, and last year, nearly 20,000 people registered to take it; the number is still growing, according to Anthony P. Ostrander, associate director of the service. Tens of thousands more take a SPEAK test, or Speaking Proficiency English Assessment Kit, which is sold by the service to colleges and universities to administer to their foreign graduate students.
 On many campuses the pronunciation programs originated in a speech pathology center, even though there is nothing wrong with these students; they simply grew up speaking another language.
 At the Queens, N.Y., campus of St. John's University, Dr. Donna Geffner, director of the Speech and Hearing Center, also teaches graduate students and faculty members whose native tongue is not English. She encourages them to bring in their textbooks for help with certain words.
 "If it's a teacher in the College of Pharmacy and Allied Health Professions," she said, "if he doesn't put the stress on the right syllable in the name of the chemical, the students don't have a clue about what he's talking about."
 That is a problem not only for the listeners, but for the speakers, too. Adelina Samuels, who came to New York from Tashkent, Russia, six years ago, said: "You have no idea how frustrating it is. I didn't speak to people for a year and a half after I came to this country, even though in a year I knew some English already. Understanding what harm I do to language when I speak, I was afraid to communicate."
 Ms. Samuels, who was a speech pathologist in Russia and now works with mentally handicapped Russian children in Queens, helping them speak, has developed her own multimedia computer program to help with pronunciation. Unlike Dr. Schwartz's, hers combines sounds with pictures of a mouth making the sounds.
 Ms. Samuels herself speaks with less than perfect grammar, but her pronunciation is clear and, with her linguist's ear, she can produce on request a credible imitation of a native saying "Lawn Gyland," where she now lives.
 Dr. Schwartz's program and Ms. Samuels's, which is not yet commercial, are two of several that use a personal computer. Computers with microphones and speakers are now almost universally available. Virginia Brogan, a speech pathologist who is a partner with Dr. Schwartz at Accent Services, contrasted this equipment with earlier tools.
 "Tape recorders were a major step forward for grammar and vocabulary, and for someone who has a good ear," she said. "For a visual learner, it's a problem." The computer, on the other hand, can give visual input to someone working on an aural task.
 But the computer is only a tool, and Dr. Schwartz has found that the software, which was developed in part with a grant from the United States Department of Education, is most useful with an instructor to run it. And a speech professional's time tends to cost more than a piano teacher's or even a plumber's: Accent Services charges about $125 an hour, and students usually take an hour or two a week. Most are professional people, like doctors or engineers.
 It also takes repeated sessions for the lessons to sink in, instructors say. But, said Ms. Brogan, "At 18 to 25 hours, it all gels."

CORRECTION-DATE: August 10, 1997, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
An article in the special Education Life section last Sunday about computer-based programs to help Asians with English pronunciation misstated the profession of Virginia Brogan, a partner in Accent Services of Cleveland Heights, Ohio. She is a multimedia specialist with a degree in anthropology, not a speech pathologist.
The article also referred erroneously to Tashkent, the native city of one program developer. It is the capital of Uzbekistan, not part of Russia.

HEADLINE: Execution Set for Tuesday Stirs Debate in California;
Appeal Says Defense Missed Flaws in Case

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 2

 BODY:
Nearly two decades after California reinstated capital punishment and more than five years after it resumed putting convicted criminals to death, the state's especially long and anguished fight over the issue finally seemed settled.
 
 In recent weeks, however, plans to execute a 42-year-old former boat repairman for the rape and murder of a young woman in Laguna Beach in 1981 have stirred new polemics in the state that has the most death row inmates in the country.
 The fate that awaits the convict, Thomas M. Thompson, has become almost familiar here. Barring a last-minute stay, Mr. Thompson will be strapped to a gurney at San Quentin State Prison and killed by a lethal injection of potassium chloride at 12:01 A.M. on Tuesday.
 Yet unlike the four men who have been executed in California since 1992 and most of the other 443 people who sit on its death row, Mr. Thompson had no prior criminal record. His supporters say he was given in inadequate courtroom defense. And almost 15 years after his conviction, there is still debate over his guilt.
 "This case leaves me with a very unsettling feeling in the pit of my stomach," said Donald H. Heller, a Sacramento lawyer who wrote the death-penalty initiative that was approved in 1978 with the support of 82 percent of the state's voters. "I've not had that feeling before with any other case in California."
 Others see the case in a very different light. Among them is the Governor, Pete Wilson, who flatly rejected Mr. Thompson's plea for clemency, saying "his claims of innocence are built on sand."
 At a hearing on Friday before the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, Mr. Thompson's lawyers did not argue his innocence. Rather, they asked the court to stay his execution on the ground that he had been ineffectually represented in trial and that prosecutors had committed misconduct by using contradictory arguments to convict Mr. Thompson and his accomplice, David Leitch, in separate proceedings.
 In an earlier motion, Mr. Thompson's lawyers also petitioned the State Supreme Court for a new trial on the basis of evidence that they say was suppressed for 15 years: Mr. Leitch's statements to his lawyers that he walked in on Mr. Thompson and the victim, Ginger Fleischli, as they engaged a consensual sex.
 Mr. Thompson had always denied raping Miss Fleischli, 20, and it was his conviction for rape that added "special circumstances" to the murder and landed him on death row. Lawyers for Mr. Thompson said that the authorities had known of Mr. Leitch's account but that they never made it available to Mr. Thompson's defense.
 "The question is, 'Did a rape occur?' " one of the Ninth Circuit judges, Stephen Reinhardt, said on Friday. "It not, he cannot be executed."
 In what will most likely be a record year for capital punishment in the United States, the pace with which death-penalty cases are being processed in California is just beginning to quicken.
 Before 1986, the State Supreme Court under Chief Justice Rose E. Bird reversed 64 of 68 death sentences that came before it. But Chief Justice Bird was swept from office that fall, and since executions resumed in 1992, opinion polls have shown its public support in the state ebbing only slightly from a high of more than 80 percent. Until Mr. Thompson began to exhaust his appeals, there was little new hint of unease with the penalty.
 At the time of Ginger Fleischli's murder, Mr. Thompson and Mr. Leitch had been sharing a modest apartment in Laguna Beach; they had met only three weeks earlier. Mr. Thompson, an Army veteran who once worked as a fire-department photographer, was scraping by doing carpentry and repairing boats. Mr. Leitch was unemployed and recently divorced.
 Miss Fleischli had dated Mr. Leitch briefly before his marriage and she moved in with him briefly after it broke up. A few weeks before her death, however, she called a Laguna Beach police officer to help her move out, telling him that Mr. Leitch had threatened to kill her.
 Miss Fleischli then moved in with Mr. Leitch's ex-wife, Tracy. The relationships remained vague enough that after the two women bumped into the two men at a restaurant on Sept. 11, 1981, the four went out together for drinks.
 David Leitch left with Tracy Leitch, and Miss Fleischli drove to Mr. Thompson's aparmtent with him and another man. But Ms. Leitch would later testify that before the group split up, Miss Fleischli had asked her, "Do you think David would have Tom kill me?"
 Miss Fleischli was found three days later in a shallow grave at a nursery in Irvine. She had bled to death after being stabbed five times in the head.
 Mr. Thompson claimed that he had had sex with Miss Fleischli and then fallen asleep soundly enough that he was not awakened by her violent murder five feet away.
 At Mr. Thompson's trial, the proscecutors said he had raped her and then killed her to cover up the rape. But in winning Mr. Leitch's conviction for second-degree murder in 1985, the prosecutors argued that rape was not the motive; they said Mr. Thompson killed the young woman on orders from Mr. Leitch, who thought she would interfere with his efforts to reconcile with his wife. (Mr. Leitch remains in prison, serving a sentence of 15 years to life.)
 In their appeal, Mr. Thompson's lawyers argued that his trial lawyer had failed to challenge obvious flaws in the state's case: uncertain physical evidence of a rape, and a pair of dubious jail-house informers who testified that Mr. Thompson had confessed to them.
 In March, a Federal District judge in Los Angeles, Richard A. Gadbois Jr., agreed with Mr. Thompson's lawyers, reversed his conviction for rape and overturned his death sentence.
 Weeks later, though, a three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit reversed Judge Gadbois's decision, saying the trial lawyer's incompetence had made no difference in the outcome.
 For the Ninth Circuit to change its mind now, said a Deputy State Attorney General, Holly Wilkens, it "must be convinced that an innocent man is about to be executed."
 The 11-judge panel has until Monday to decide the case.

HEADLINE: Not Drinking: A Love Story

BYLINE: By Valerie Sayers; Valerie Sayers is a professor of English at the University of Notre Dame. Her latest novel is "Brain Fever."

 BODY:

ROUND ROCK
 By Michelle Huneven.
 296 pp. New York:
 Alfred A. Knopf. $24. 
 MICHELLE HUNEVEN has found an apt form for her immensely likable first novel: to tell the story of two recovering alcoholics, she uses an omniscient narrator with a clear, authoritative voice. Clarity and higher authority, the reader comes to see, are important concepts in this book. While it is not exactly a 12-step tale, "Round Rock" borrows from Alcoholics Anonymous an insistence on facing sad truths in the past and then getting on, one day at a time, with the rest of life.
The two men in question are Red Ray, a lawyer and founder of the Round Rock Farm for Recovering Alcoholics in California's Santa Bernita Valley, and Lewis Fletcher, a graduate student who, before arriving at Round Rock, has been collecting incompletes and sleeping in his professor's garage. In turn, they become involved with Libby Daw, a violinist living in a trailer near Round Rock.
Huneven gives her readers a strong sense of the Santa Bernita Valley, which is defined by the Rito River and the citrus groves that cover the countryside. In the valley, the irrigation ditches sometimes flow uphill and so, the novel's prologue hints, does life. Yet some aspects of the landscape are said to have therapeutic powers, particularly rocks from the river that are "perfectly, naturally, remarkably round!" The phrase, and its exclamation point, give a good sense of Huneven's straightforward prose, as well as her suggestion that coming to terms with the physical world is a crucial element of spiritual healing.
In such a climate, healing often seems elusive. Red has been sober for years, but his life as director of Round Rock is sometimes lonely, filled with self-doubt. Lewis cannot admit, at first, that he is an alcoholic. And once he does leave his drinking life, he finds it hard to attach himself to any life at all. (He has studied "inscape and individuation" in Gerard Manley Hopkins, but has difficulty locating his own interior.) In this age of the sympathetic character, it's delightful to see how unlikable Lewis can be. He is needy, selfish, immature -- in other words, real -- and his bad-boy stunts provide the early stretches of the novel with dramatic tension and the hope of forgiveness.
Libby, the object of the two men's affections, has recently been abandoned by her husband. Her open, honest face, which suggests the possibility of strong attachment, both attracts and terrifies them. Deftly shifting the narrative's focus from one character to another, Huneven lays bare these three searching souls. One of the novel's happy strengths is its depiction of their sex lives: Huneven's forthright language comes in especially handy here.
Forthright language is also used to describe the characters' spiritual lives, and gradually it becomes clear that spirituality will provide the underpinning of their stories. Lewis, an unapologetic atheist as the book opens, prays recklessly and profanely by its end. The reader also learns that Red has gone through a funny (and very Californian) series of spiritual quests. Huneven is matter-of-fact about her characters' grabs for God and about A.A.'s belief in a higher power. The search for a purposeful life, she reminds us, does not happen in a spiritual vacuum, and it does not necessarily happen within the confines of organized religion.
Nor does healing happen in a cultural vacuum. (It is no coincidence that Lewis is pursuing a doctorate in cultural history.) The valley's class structure is shaped by the wealth of the growers (one refers to the farm workers as "my Mexicans") and the economic struggles of the workers. One of the novel's most tantalizing characters is David Ibanez, a target of wealthy white prejudice and a practitioner of Mexican healing arts. Indeed, the book would be stronger if his presence -- accompanied as it is by an emphasis on tradition and ritual, as well as politics -- were more fully established earlier. And Huneven's introduction of many new characters, especially Lewis's friends and lovers, two-thirds of the way through the book produces a small patch of mundane, literal storytelling in an otherwise rich and tightly constructed narrative.
"Round Rock" uses metaphor gracefully and simply. Happy Yolanda's, a local bar, is described as a place with "no gimmicks," which makes it akin to Huneven's writing. Like that other West Coast chronicler of struggling Americans, Raymond Carver, she's determined to tell the story straight. She is not interested in literary pretension or post-modern razzle-dazzle, but in achieving a measure of truth -- and her generous, engaging novel does just that.

HEADLINE: The Iranians Confirm A Moderate As President

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: TEHERAN, Iran, Aug. 3

 BODY:
Mohammed Khatami, a moderate Islamic cleric overwhelmingly elected after promising Iranians social and political change, was confirmed today as the country's President.
During a religious ceremony before his swearing-in before Iran's Parliament on Monday, Mr. Khatami said that Iran "wanted peaceful coexistence with the world." 
 "The message of our revolution is the message of spirituality, peace and security," he said, referring to the 1979 Islamic revolution in a brief speech before hundreds of ministers and senior officials sitting cross-legged on a carpeted floor.
But he added that in pursuing those goals Iran would "oppose the high-handedness of certain big countries," a thinly veiled reference to the United States.
Since sweeping to power with 69 percent of the vote in May, Mr. Khatami has been watched closely in the West for signs that he might moderate the hard-line policies of Iran's ruling clerics.
American officials have said that any warming of ties would depend first on changes in Teheran. Specifically, they have warned Iran against supporting terrorism, scuttling peace efforts in the Middle East and pursuing nuclear weapons.
While some foreign ambassadors came to the ceremony today, representatives from European Union countries did not attend. Nearly all European Union countries recalled their ambassadors after a German court ruling in April that implicated top Iranian leaders in political assassinations in Berlin.
Most of the 20 million voters who supported Mr. Khatami, a former culture minister, were younger Iranians dissatisified with Iran's strict social code and ailing economy. But the new President will nonetheless face a formidable challenge from the ultra-conservatives who still dominate Iran's Parliament.
The hard-liners are already preparing a challenge to Mr. Khatami's choice of Cabinet ministers, who for the first time are expected to include women. The ceremony today was a reminder that much real power in Iran resides with the ruling clerics. The outgoing President, Hashemi Rafsanjani, read the confirmation of Mr. Khatami on behalf of Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khamenei. All the men wore the turbans and flowing robes of clerics.

HEADLINE: Bennett A. Brown, 68, Southern Banking Executive

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
Bennett A. Brown, a captain of Southern banking who navigated through the financial shoals of bad real estate loans and interstate mergers, died on Saturday morning at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta. He was 68.
Lung cancer was diagnosed in Mr. Brown a year ago. 
 He served as chief executive of the Citizens and Southern National Bank of Atlanta from 1978 to 1991, when the bank acceded to a takeover offer from the NCNB Corporation of Charlotte, N.C. Mr. Brown served as chairman of the combined company, renamed Nationsbank, through 1992.
Through the 1960's and 70's, Citizens and Southern had been the largest and most flamboyant bank in the South. But its loose real estate lending practices sent the bank to the brink of failure in the recession of the mid-1970's. The problems lingered and the bank was under close regulatory scrutiny in 1978, when Mr. Brown was named acting chairman. The appointment was meant to be temporary, and a search was under way for an outsider to take the helm.
"The troubles were of such magnitude you could hardly describe it," said Larry Gellerstedt, a longtime member of the Citizens and Southern board. The board ultimately decided to give Mr. Brown the job permanently.
"It was so impressive to see how the management team and the people in the bank rallied behind Bennett; there was an air of euphoria," Mr. Gellerstedt recalled.
Mr. Brown clamped down on lending standards and nursed the bank back to health. In the 1980's, he led an acquisition spree, first buying smaller Georgia banks and later, when the law allowed, banks in Florida and South Carolina, as well. But Citizens and Southern's earlier troubles fostered a caution that caused it to fall behind other Southern banks, especially NCNB, which by then had become the biggest in the South.
In 1989, Citizens and Southern rebuffed an unsolicited takeover offer from NCNB. Mr. Brown was put off by Hugh L. McColl Jr., NCNB's brash and ambitious chairman, who announced the bid without ever speaking to him.
A few months later, Citizens and Southern agreed to merge with the Sovran Financial Corporation of Norfolk, Va., in what was then the largest bank merger in the United States. Mr. Brown remained chairman.
That merger hurt Citizens and Southern more than it helped it. The two partners never worked together well, and Sovran turned out to be full of bad real estate loans, this time in and around Washington.
Detecting weakness, Mr. McColl tried again to buy Citizens and Southern in 1991. This time, he tried to reach out to Mr. Brown in a private and friendly manner. Eventually, Mr. Brown agreed to the $4.3 billion takeover.
That deal created what would be renamed Nationsbank and was, at the time, the second-largest bank in the country. It has now fallen back to the fourth largest, but has continued to be one of the most aggressive banks in the country. After the merger took effect, Mr. Brown served as chairman of Nationsbank for a year although Mr. McColl remained chief executive.
Mr. Brown was born in Kinstree, S.C. After graduating from Presbyterian College in South Carolina, he served in the Army and then worked briefly at Chemical Bank in New York. He joined Citizens and Southern as a trainee in 1955, moving up through a series of jobs with increasing responsibilities.
Since retiring in 1992, he lived in Atlanta and on Pawleys Island, S.C.
Mr. Brown served as president of the Bankers Roundtable, a leading industry group, and of the Atlanta Chamber of Commerce.
He is survived by his wife, the former Mary Alice Rustin of Columbia, S.C.; three daughters, Charlotte Brown Dixon of Atlanta, Leila Brown Armknecht of Salt Lake City, and Katherine Brown Ohlhausen of Atlanta; a son, Bennett Alexander Brown 3d of Temple, Ga., and six grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Watch 800 Companies Stuff Themselves Into One Phone Booth;
In the Long-Distance Market, Lean And Mean Just Gets the Door Open

BYLINE: By SETH SCHIESEL 

 BODY:
Kenny Troutt got into the long-distance telephone business after the oil market went bust. In late 1988 he abandoned the petroleum fields for the discount grocery stores that dotted suburban Dallas almost as densely as dormant oil wells.
There, on sidewalks outside sliding glass doors he persuaded bargain-stalkers to pare their phone bills by signing up with a long-distance company few of them had ever heard of. 
 Mr. Troutt isn't haunting strip malls and church socials anymore. His company, Excel Communications Inc., sold about $1.1 billion worth of telephone time in 1996 and this year is poised to become the sixth-largest long-distance company in the nation.
Excel is only one of the biggest of the more than 800 companies that have pried into the $82 billion long-distance business since deregulation in 1984, following the breakup of the AT&T Corporation.
Few of the new carriers have done as well as Excel, which has grown on the back of a commissioned, part-time sales force dedicated to winning over friends and family. But most of these new competitors have turned a healthy profit while whittling AT&T's market share to less than 50 percent.
"I was looking for something that was sort of recession-proof," Mr. Troutt said in a recent telephone interview. "I was in oil when oil was $8 a barrel and in construction when interest rates were 20 percent. I was looking for something everyone used, and where you could build a customer base -- and if it was succesful you could take it nationwide and even worldwide. And my brother said, 'Hey, the communications business would be a great opportunity.' "
But the fat years seem near their end; squeezing into the crowded long-distance market is becoming possible only for the slimmest of players and for those with bulging muscles of capital strong enough to push aside competitors far more tenacious than AT&T.
The demand for advanced data communications services continues to soar, fueled by the popularity of the Internet, and most of the top long-distance companies are profiting from it. But the lifeblood of the long-distance giants remains standard interstate phone service.
Even as Americans spend more time on the telephone, declining rates are making profit margins thinner than the dimes many customers pay for a minute of conversation. And in a twist on customary economies of scale, niche long-distance companies that resell network time they buy from others are continuing to surge even as their suppliers, the bigger carriers, begin to stumble.
"I don't think there's any question the overall industry has slowed a bit, starting maybe at the back half of last year," said Gary Forsee, president of the long-distance division at the Sprint Corporation, the No. 3 long-distance carrier.
Long-distance companies rarely lose money, but the last two quarterly earnings reports for five of the six largest carriers (including Excel, which plans to complete an acquisition of Telco Communications Group Inc. this year) showed a drop in earnings per share, relative to corresponding periods a year earlier.
The exception was Worldcom Inc., the No. 4 long-distance carrier, which posted modest profits in the first half of this year after a large loss over the beginning of 1996. But Wall Street analysts are predicting lower earnings during the current quarter for all six of them.
Last week's earnings report from the MCI Communications Corporation, the No. 2 long-distance operator, was typical of the larger carriers. Earnings for the second quarter fell 6.7 percent from the corresponding 1996 period. Some of the loss stemmed from large new investments in the company's network.
But while the traffic carried on that network rose by 5.5 percent, down from an 8.2 percent increase in the first quarter, long-distance revenues increased by only 4.7 percent.
Excel's per-share earnings over the last two quarters declined by about 6.1 percent from the 1996 period.
"The transmission and the provisioning of long-distance service is pretty much a commodity operation, like grown wheat," said Frank Governali, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston. "What's not a commodity is the way in which you distribute and sell the product, the wheat. Are you making Wonder Bread? Are you selling cake mix?"
Commodity is just about the last term that Gail McGovern, who runs AT&T's residential long-distance business, wants to hear applied to telephone service. Excluding toll calls carried by local phone companies, AT&T's share of the long-distance market fell to 47.9 percent from 90.1 percent between 1984 and last year, according to the Federal Communications Commission. One reason for the loss could be that AT&T's rates are routinely the highest in the industry.
The way to stanch the bleeding, Ms. McGovern said, is to reduce the emphasis on finding new customers and instead focus on retaining those who have not fled already. Slashing prices, she said, would not help.
"People are differentiating paper towels, toothpaste, water," she said. "You probably pay $2 for a bottle of Evian water."
So, the logic goes, there is no reason AT&T should not be able to persuade customers to pay a few more cents a minute to use AT&T, confident in the knowledge that they are getting a superior product -- and a vital one.
"People probably touch AT&T's products and services more often than they touch water," Ms. McGovern said. "Probably the only thing that people consume more than communications is air. We can command a price premium because we invest in innovation and have an R & D program that helps customers enrich their lives."
By way of example Ms. McGovern pointed to new AT&T long-distance enhancements that are meant to enhance sound quality; to allow a customer's bill to be organized by sub-accounts and to allow automatic redialing of a busy number.
One reason AT&T does not want to play the pricing game may be that the company cannot afford it. The company's cost structure is one of the most weighty in the industry.
Despite reducing its overall selling, general and administrative costs by 11.5 percent since 1992, AT&T still spent $113,390 per employee on such costs in 1996, according to a recent report from Arthur Andersen, the consulting firm. That compared with $90,947 at MCI, $79,143 at Excel, $65,792 at Sprint and $63,769 at Worldcom. AT&T has said it intends to reduce costs by an additional $2.6 billion this year.
If any set of companies is responsible for AT&T's position in the market, it is not big-name competitors -- MCI, Sprint, and in the business market Worldcom; rather, it is the gaggle of relatively obscure companies that buy or lease network time in bulk from major carriers and resell it at a markup.
Companies other than the four largest -- AT&T, MCI, Sprint and Worldcom -- have increased their share of the market to 17 percent last year from 2.6 percent in 1984.
In the market serving small and medium-sized businesses, fast-growing companies like LCI International Inc. and the American subsidiary of Cable and Wireless of Britain have used such a resale strategy to complement their own networks. The Frontier Corporation, a large carrier that is more balanced between business and residential customers, has done so as well, though it has struggled recently.
The most prolific resellers in the residential market, besides Excel, have been what are known as the dial-around companies, which have blanketed the country with direct mail advertisements urging customers to dial a five-digit code to receive low rates, often 10 cents a minute.
Unlike companies like Excel, which usually require users to switch their default long-distance carrier, the dial-around companies allow users to keep their provider.
"There is a great deal of hesitation on the part of the typical consumer to give up their subscriber service because it's what they're used to," said Al Beach, director of consumer marketing for Vartec Telecom Inc., which will become the No. 1 dial-around provider once Excel completes its acquisition of Telco.
Vartec's long-distance revenue increased to $470 million last year from $107 million in 1994, according to the F.C.C.. The company is projecting $1 billion in sales this year.
To beat back the resellers, AT&T, MCI and Sprint are counting on their entry into the $100 billion local telephone market. Of the three, only MCI has registered market-share growth recently, creeping to 20 percent from 19.7 percent last year. Sprint is at the same position in the market, 9.7 percent, that it was in 1990.
That is the kind of competitive urge that the architects of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 hoped to see when they provided ways for long-distance companies to begin offering local service.
But they also provided ways for the local phone companies to move into the overstuffed long-distance market. The six regional Bell local telephone companies, with a combined market value of about $212 billion, are themselves set to wade into the long-distance market, with capital resources that outweigh those of the six largest long-distance companies, which are valued at a combined $134 billion.
And, since most technology and financial analysts consider local telephone markets a far more complex technical and business environment than its long-distance counterpart, many predict that the regional Bells will win as much as 20 percent of the country's long-distance business within five years -- but far fewer believe that the long-distance companies will win a comparable share of the local market.
The long-distance companies' bid to offer local service is "definitely a defensive strategy," said Steve Korba, an analyst at Northern Business Information. "Let's face it, you're dealing with a highly subsidized segment called residence, which is mostly under cost. They have to bite the bullet to hold onto their core business."
But the bullet might not taste so bad. If the free-for-all contemplated by the Telecommunications Act begins in earnest over the next few years, almost every telecommunications company is going to lose share in its core market in exchange for opportunities elsewhere, analysts said.
"AT&T's share slippage has only just begun," said Bryan Van Dussen, a telecommunications analyst at the Yankee Group, a consulting firm in Boston. "When the regional Bell telephone companies get into in-region long-distance, the long-distance companies' market share is going to drop precipitously, no matter what value or service propositions they argue."

More than 800 companies have entered the $82 billion long-distance telephone business since the industry's deregulation in 1984. Most of them have turned a healthy profit while helping erode AT&T's dominance. Revenues have increased, but so has competition, pushing prices down.

HEADLINE: Even Titles Are Flexible as U.S. Magazines Adapt to Foreign Ways

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS 

 BODY:
When Conde Nast Traveler starts its British edition in October, alert readers may notice one difference right away: "Traveler" is to be spelled with two l's, the way the British prefer.
Inside, there will be differences, too, with the types of articles that are deemed important to Britons. "There really is a hole in that market and Conde Nast Traveller will step right into it," said Lisa Henriques, the publisher of the original. Hawaii might not receive the same coverage as the American magazine provides, she said, but other destinations more popular with British travelers -- Provence, perhaps, or the Himalayas -- will fill the space. 
 Conde Nast Traveller is but one of a proliferation of exported American magazines that are altered in language and content, sometimes only slightly and in other cases radically, to appeal to readers as wide ranging as the South African residential elite (House and Garden, a Conde Nast title), the fashion-conscious, upwardly mobile European woman (Glamour, also a Conde Nast magazine) and the emerging-markets consumer (Buenhogar, as Good Housekeeping, a Hearst title, is known in Latin America). Then there are the post-Iron Curtain woman who wants to have it all (Polish Cosmopolitan) and the Teutonic self-improvement seeker (the German edition of Men's Health, a Rodale Press publication).
"If you're just thinking Manhattan, you're dead," said Judy Price, the president of Avenue Magazine Inc., which publishes Avenue, a glossy life-style magazine with local editions in China, France, Japan and Spain that are published in the languages of those countries. "You have to think globally."
That thinking, said to be hugely profitable though few companies will release figures, has required normally identity-conscious American publishers to bow to the tastes of each area, relying on either joint-venture partners or licensing their titles to companies that retain most of the control over content.
The activity has built at a fevered pace, with the Hearst Corporation starting five overseas editions of Cosmopolitan alone this year, for a total of 33 Cosmos worldwide and nearly 100 editions over all, counting all nine Hearst titles. Reader's Digest has another huge effort overseas, with 48 editions in 19 languages that are sold to 27 million readers, nearly twice the magazine's 15 million American readers. Conde Nast, whose magazines are owned by Advance Publications, is starting 7 titles this year to bring its total to 39.
"The rest of the world has started to catch up to the West in economic development and in its thirst for information and advertised products," said Jonathan Newhouse, the chairman of Conde Nast International.
A request by an advertiser prompted the creation of at least one foreign edition of a Conde Nast magazine. "The president of Estee Lauder International came to us and said, 'Why don't you launch Vogue in Korea? We need Vogue in Korea to market our products,' " Mr. Newhouse recalled. Last year, Korean Vogue appeared.
These days, the market appears to be entering a secondary phase, in which American publishers are talking seriously about buying foreign-owned magazines -- something international media companies did in the United States years ago.
"Traditionally, U.S. publishers have been very reluctant to partner with companies in foreign markets," says Marco Sodi, a managing director at Veronis Suhler & Associates, the media mergers and acquisition firm. "But through licenses and start-ups they have learned they can be quite successful in those markets. For the most part, they are able to buy 100 percent of these foreign companies. It's about time they do."
Out in front of this trend is Hearst and its Hearst Magazines International.
"We're embarking on a program of investment and acquisition," said George J. Green, president of Hearst Magazines International. "We do think we could invest in some of our partners and at the same time in other publishers with other kinds of titles. And we've been given whatever resources we need."
Hearst is so bullish overseas that Mr. Green and others in the company anticipate that international profits will account for 50 percent of the magazine unit's earnings within a few years, double the current 25 percent.
Investing heavily in international publications represents a sharp switch in Hearst's strategy, which has been to start up magazines as cheaply as possible, using mostly local labor in the foreign editions and overseeing them from New York.
Total ownership of overseas publications appears to make the most sense for many American publishers, since they would have both total control and all the profits. Reader's Digest is looking at several potential acquisitions in Europe, said the worldwide editor in chief, Christopher Willcox, though he refused to be more specific. "We're looking for opportunities," he said.
One media giant that has not aggressively pursued the international publishing scene is the Time Warner unit Time Inc., which has made only a handful of acquisitions and minor forays into new markets.
"It's harder to do with news magazines," said Henry Muller, Time Inc.'s editorial director. "There are certain topics, like fashion, in which the interest doesn't shift all that much around the world. There are other topics -- and news is a good example -- that are very sensitive to the culture for which they're written."
Mr. Muller insisted that Time Inc. was interested in overseas publishing. It has licensed an Australian edition of People, called Who. A Chinese edition of Fortune is published through CCI Asia Pacific Ltd., an independent Hong Kong company. Time Inc. also owns Asia Week, an English-language news magazine based in Hong Kong. The company is printing supplements from Fortune, translated into Spanish, that are distributed in Latin American newspapers, and it may do the same with Time magazine. "We are open to trying different things in different places," Mr. Muller said. Last month, it acquired Wallpaper, a British interior-design magazine.
With all the growth, entire swaths of the globe remain untouched, usually markets, like most of Africa, that are widely held to be too small. And few publishers have succeeded in China.
"The Far East, for whatever reason, just scares a lot of people," said Mrs. Price, the president of Avenue, which got its Chinese edition going in 1994 through an alliance with an arm of the Chinese tourism ministry. It is not profitable, she added. But it needs time. "The reason we're all there, hunkered down in this community," she said, "is because we feel there's a future."

HEADLINE: Flake Tells Parishioners He'll Be All Theirs

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS 

 BODY:
By the time they arrived for the 8:30 service yesterday morning, the congregants had known for days that their minister would leave Congress. Nonetheless, when the Rev. Floyd H. Flake took to the pulpit yesterday to formally announce that he was resigning from the House of Representatives after 11 years, there was no shortage of drama and poignancy.
With his wife, Elaine, by his side wiping away tears, Mr. Flake -- the pastor of the Allen African Methodist Episcopal Church in Jamaica, Queens, and a Democratic member of New York's Congressional delegation -- explained to the standing-room assembly of worshipers that he had grown weary of a routine of catching shuttle flights day after day to get home from Capitol Hill for the evening service at the church. With his congregation burgeoning and the church's enterprises expanding, he said, he wanted to devote more time to the work of being a pastor. 
 And so, with some members beaming, others weeping, and clearly overcome by emotion himself, Mr. Flake said he would leave the House, effective Oct. 15.
"So many of the nights that you saw me, I had already been to Washington all day long," he told the hushed, standing congregation. "After 11 years of going and coming and going and coming," he said, it had grown strenuous "to do what I've done in Congress and still be able to lead you in the building of this tremendous cathedral."
In the cavernous, $23 million cathedral that opened just a week ago, Mr. Flake's announcement brought together not just members of Allen A.M.E., community residents and friends from across the city, but also a wide array of politicians who rarely converge.
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani was in a front pew, clapping to the beat of the gospel music. Directly across the aisle was the Rev. Al Sharpton, a candidate in the Democratic primary for Mayor who does not share much political philosophy with the incumbent.
In the pew with Mr. Sharpton -- who received the loudest ovation among the guests who were introduced -- were another Democratic mayoral aspirant, Ruth W. Messinger; Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi, and some of Mr. Flake's Congressional colleagues: Thomas J. Manton, Charles B. Rangel and Edolphus Towns. A few pews back was City Councilman Sal F. Albanese, another candidate in the Democratic primary for Mayor.
The wide array of politicians at the service was in large measure a testament to Mr. Flake's philosophy -- which he summarized often yesterday -- of leveraging his political power with both parties to gain economic clout for his church.
At a time when Mr. Flake's political influence is viewed widely as being at its zenith, his decision to resign is seen as a curiosity in political circles. Some have suggested that he is gearing up for a mayoral run in 2001, speculation he has vigorously denied.
Mr. Flake sought to take on the issue yesterday. "Most people believe that once you get there and you get the power, that you're there forever," he said. "But my love is that which I've been called to do," he said, referring to his work in the ministry.
Mr. Flake's decision has been greeted with divergent opinions by the members of his congregation. Several said they were torn between their desire to have Mr. Flake spend more time at Allen A.M.E., and the political influence he wields as a Congressman.
In a sermon filled with fiery oratory, Mr. Flake indicated that he would write books and that he planned to be a crusader, urging black politicians and others to rely less on government for solutions to social problems and more on developing economic programs for their communities.
"America has shifted, and we're still holding on to the rhetoric of the 1960's," Mr. Flake said to thunderous applause. "Yes, fight for welfare. But understand that, even before there was a welfare program, we were a people determined to make something out of our lives and to do something for ourselves."
The political scramble to succeed Mr. Flake in Congress was a prominent undercurrent yesterday.
Assemblyman Gregory W. Meeks attended the service at Allen A.M.E. -- as well as the earlier one at 6:30 -- before joining his colleagues in Albany who were deliberating on the state budget. "I will, in fact, be a candidate," he told reporters after the service. "We're beginning to put a campaign committee together."
Also in attendance was City Councilman Archie Spigner, who has said he is thinking of running.
In Albany, State Senator Alton Waldon Jr., who briefly held the 6th Congressional District seat in Congress a decade ago, said he had decided to run.
"I'm doing all that one has to do to run for Congress," Mr. Waldon said in a telephone interview. "I will be seeking the county's designation," he said, referring to the Queens Democratic Party organization. "But I will run no matter what. I don't have to have a learning curve. I know what to do."
Assemblywoman Barbara M. Clark sounded a lot like a candidate in a telephone interview from Albany, though she said she had not decided whether to run. "I'm very interested in it," she said. "There has been no black female in Congress from New York since Shirley Chisholm, and she's been out of office for 15 years. I feel a responsibility to try to change that."
Under the state's election law, the Governor will call a special election no sooner than 30 days after Mr. Flake leaves office. Several politicians have speculated that the election will likely be in January or February.
Mr. Flake said he had not decided whom to endorse, but left little doubt of his regard for Mr. Meeks, whose marriage ceremony he performed two weeks ago.
Speaking to reporters after the service, he mentioned all four candidates, saying he had worked closely with them over the years. But with Mr. Meeks at his side, Mr. Flake said the Assemblyman's candidacy "would probably make some sense for the continuity of what I've been doing."

HEADLINE: After Condemnations, Arafat Is Still a Target

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 3

 BODY:
In the welter of outrage and agony that has followed Wednesday's suicide bombings in a crowded Jerusalem market, the most piercing Israeli allegation has been that Yasir Arafat bears primary responsibility. The Israeli Government says the Palestinian leader has made angry or incendiary comments, failed to condemn such statements by others and refused to cooperate fully on security matters.
Israel's delegate to the United Nations, Dore Gold, told the PBS program "Newshour" on Wednesday night that "preliminary evidence" on the source of the bombing pointed to Hamas, the militant Palestinian group that opposes peace with Israel. "However, we're pointing the finger of blame to the Palestinian Authority," Mr. Gold said, referring to the governing body Mr. Arafat heads. 
 No one is suggesting that Mr. Arafat authorized or even gave a "green light" to the bombers. Mr. Arafat was quick to respond to the bombing, saying, "I condemn it completely, these terrorist activities, because it's against the peace process."
But Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has accused Mr. Arafat of doing little to stop violence, creating an atmosphere in which Islamic militants feel free to stage attacks.
Senior American officials say Mr. Arafat was "shocked" by the attack and understood that it was also aimed at him, even though they criticized his "inconsistent efforts" to crack down on terrorists.
"One can't expect 100 percent results when fighting terrorism," Samuel R. Berger, the national security adviser, said today on the CBS News program "Face the Nation." "But there can be a total, 100 percent unrelenting effort. I think the effort's been uneven. It has to intensify."
Mr. Gold asserted that after an American-brokered agreement in January on the withdrawal of Israeli troops from much of the West Bank city of Hebron, the Palestinian Authority "failed to fulfill any of its commitments," especially in security. "Had they fulfilled those commitments -- in our judgment -- this type of incident wouldn't have occurred," he said.
The Palestinians, in return, say Israel violates its commitments under the Oslo accords on greater Palestinian self-rule, creating political and economic despair in which terrorism thrives.
To bolster the Israeli case, Mr. Netanyahu's office and pro-Israel groups keep a running list of Palestinian statements that are considered incendiary, called "golden nuggets" by the Government Press Office, and make them available on the Internet.
But even Israeli officials and diplomats, speaking on promise of anonymity, say Mr. Arafat has been careful about his own public statements, especially this year, since the Hebron accords. Sometimes he has been angry or frustrated, but rarely incendiary. More problematic, they say, is his refusal to condemn inflammatory statements or actions by others, including his own cabinet ministers or the Voice of Palestine radio.
"While there is a level of Palestinian frustration that he, as their leader, must acknowledge," an Israeli diplomat said, "there are tacit messages. If he chooses not to say something, that carries messages, too."
Under the Hebron accords, the Palestinians promised to prevent incitement and hostile propaganda. More important than the words, Israelis say, is Mr. Arafat's open strategy of providing and withholding security cooperation as a form of leverage on Israel.
The Israelis have documented a decline in security cooperation from the Palestinians since the uproar over an Israeli housing project in Jerusalem in March, followed by a Hamas suicide bombing in Tel Aviv on March 21. The Palestinian Authority has released "dozens" of Hamas and other extremists from detention in what Israel calls "a revolving door policy," while failing to extradite terror suspects or confiscate illegal weapons.
They say Mr. Arafat has done nothing about allegations that the Palestinian police in the West Bank city of Nablus ordered attacks on Jews and that the Palestinian police commander for Gaza and the West Bank, Gen. Ghazi Jabali, is involved. On Thursday, Israel issued an arrest warrant for him.
"The police issue is very serious," said Robert Satloff, director of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. "Jabali is appointed by Arafat. For many months there is a pattern of Arafat letting a lot of things happen that he shouldn't, letting people out of jail, letting Hamas re-emerge as a legitimate political actor and letting violence go on in Hebron."
Senior State Department officials reject any simple connection between Mr. Arafat's statements, or even his efforts to keep up tension, and the bombings.
"You have to distinguish between violence, rioting and the Palestinian police not stopping rock throwers and the suicide bombers themselves," a senior official said. "There's a lot of the former Arafat could have fixed, but if the argument is that the former causes the latter, it's not necessarily true -- there were four suicide bombers before." He referred to the former Labor Government of Prime Minister Shimon Peres, who had a more cooperative relationship with Mr. Arafat.
"It's true Arafat uses security cooperation as leverage, but it's not true that he causes suicide bombers," the official said. "In fact, his ability to put international pressure on Israel is destroyed by these events."
The official conceded that Mr. Arafat's ambivalent attitude toward Hamas is damaging. "It's a problem when he can't -- or won't -- decide whether to co-opt them or destroy them," the official said of Hamas.
Even those sympathetic to Mr. Arafat, like Philip Mattar, director of the Institute for Palestine Studies here, acknowledge that he is riding a tiger, and sometimes maladroitly.
"He's in a tough position," Mr. Mattar said. "He's trying to find cells and future plans. But on the other hand, he can't be unhappy about some tension between the United States and Israel, since the political process so far has gotten him so little -- a few cities and some 2.8 percent of the occupied territories."
Israeli border closures, preventing Palestinians from working in Israel, are oppressive, Mr. Mattar said, and even American officials recognize that per capita income among Palestinians has dropped by a third. "So the economy is bad, and politically it looks bleak with Netanyahu, so they ask, 'What good is Oslo?' " he said. "Arafat has a hard time answering, and his negatives in the polls have increased tremendously."
Abroad, Mr. Arafat has lost some credibility through his indecision, his refusal to quickly condemn hostile or incendiary statements by others and reports of pervasive corruption in his cabinet. "The Palestinian diaspora is quite upset with the behavior of Arafat and Company," Mr. Mattar said. "We have dreams of a nation, yet this looks like another corrupt, inept regime."

HEADLINE: U.S. OFFICIALS SAY CHINA IS NOT READY FOR TRADE GROUP

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 2

 BODY:
After several months of slogging negotiations, Clinton Administration officials say they now doubt that they will reach broad agreement this year to admit China to the World Trade Organization, an accord they once hoped would be the centerpiece of President Jiang Zemin's state visit to Washington in October.
American officials had hoped that during talks in Beijing and Geneva that concluded on Friday, China would make a comprehensive offer to open its markets and allow foreign competitors to take on state-owned Chinese industries, which employ a majority of China's urban population. 
 But instead, officials from the United States and Europe said, China's negotiators offered piecemeal concessions. Now American officials are questioning whether Mr. Jiang, who is assembling a leadership team that will be formally endorsed at a major party congress just before his visit here, is ready to take the politically difficult steps required for his country to join the club of trading nations. Now, 131 countries and regions are members of the World Trade Organization -- with the notable exceptions of g China and Russia -- and Beijing has sharply criticized the West for setting conditions that it believes bar it from entry.
American officials say that China is unwilling to make large-scale concessions that would allow, for example, foreign companies to sell stock, deliver packages commercially and sell telecommunications services across the breadth of China. Currently, a number of companies are permitted to do these things, but only on an experimental basis in some cities.
"China's offers were tepid," said Charlene Barshefsky, the United States trade representative who has supervised the delicate negotiations. "This was a view shared by a number of our trading partners," she said, even Japan and Europe, which have pressed for quicker admission for China under relaxed rules. "If China wishes its hopes to enter the W.T.O. to be a key element of the meeting with President Clinton, it must move quite rapidly now," she said. "But there is no indication at this juncture that China intends to move meaningfully forward."
Some of the comments made by Ms. Barshefsky's negotiating team and their Chinese counterparts in recent days were clearly part of the posturing that accompanies the complex economic negotiations that have become the 1990's successors to arms control talks. But the negotiations over market openings in China are particularly fraught with high-level politics in both capitals.
Chinese leaders have to weigh whether it is worth surrendering further control over the nation's economy to market forces in order to meet the entrance requirements for the World Trade Organization. And they have to consider the potential political costs if open competition -- and a phasing out of subsidies to state-run industries -- results in waves of unemployment.
In Washington, the current investigations into China's possible role in the 1996 Presidential and congressional campaigns have also lurked in the background. Several months ago, Chinese officials warned that they would not make a comprehensive trade offer if they believed that President Clinton could not enter serious negotiations that would also require concessions on the American side.
"They are worried that any American concession to China would result in someone charging that the Chinese were getting a favor for their contributions, even if they didn't make any contributions," one senior American official said recently. "And they may be right -- this is not a time when Clinton can make many horse trades."
China's intentions may also become clearer in a series of high-level visits by American officials to Beijing over the next several months. Administration officials say President Clinton's national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, is considering a trip there later this month, if the latest Middle East crisis recedes. Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin is planning his first trip there in late September, and that may turn out to be the last chance to settle on agreements that could be finalized during Mr. Jiang's state visit, the first by a top Chinese leader since the 1989 military crackdown on pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square.
But Ms. Barshefsky said she had no immediate plans to travel to China, despite an announcement by China's chief negotiator, Long Yongtu, that she was coming to Beijing soon. Her direct participation in the talks would be the surest sign that a deal was nearing.
Negotiators who have sat at the table with the Chinese for several weeks report that there has been modest progress. For example, the Chinese promised not to provide export subsidies for agricultural products. Although China offers no such subsidies now, American officials are concerned that as China's market opens, farmers will press the Government to help them send their products abroad.
China also agreed to eliminate import quotas for cars and minibuses -- which have kept American and Japanese makers from making vehicles in their existing factories and shipping them to China -- over 8 years instead of the 15 years they first offered. Currently, American auto manufacturers seeking to sell cars in China must enter joint ventures to build cars there, and agree to transfer significant manufacturing technology to their Chinese partners. While several carmakers have entered such arrangements, others have balked, saying China's demands are too high.
Chinese negotiators have also agreed to abolish quotas on the importation of other items as soon as the country is admitted to the World Trade Organization, and reduce tariffs on a range of goods, although American officials say the cuts are still insufficient.
At a meeting last month, President Clinton's economic advisers generally agreed that the most that could now be hoped for from Mr. Clinton's summit meeting with Mr. Jiang is a commitment to keep talking -- rather than a real accord.

HEADLINE: U.P.S. Struck By Teamsters As Talks Fail

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
The drivers, loaders and sorters of the United Parcel Service began walking off the job early this morning after the president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters announced a strike by 185,000 union members at U.P.S. Negotiations had faltered over pensions and the use of part-time workers.
The action against U.P.S., the nation's largest shipping company, could create havoc for businesses across the United States in seeking to ship millions of packages. 
 The union's president, Ronald Carey, announced the strike about two hours before the deadline of 12:01 A.M. Eastern time and after emerging from almost three hours of intense but unsuccessful talks with a Federal mediator and officials from U.P.S.
"We have exhausted every possible approach to try to resolve the problem," Mr. Carey told reporters shortly after the talks broke off at the mediator's office in Washington. "At this point, it's just a waste of time."
The principal obstacles to an agreement have been the union's demand that U.P.S. hire more full-time workers and fewer part-timers and the company's demand to set up a new pension plan and pull out of the current multiemployer plan.
"It's about good jobs in America," Mr. Carey said. "It's about jobs that have some hope for the great American dream."
Shortly after midnight, teamsters appeared with picket signs at U.P.S. sites in New York City, Atlanta, Louisville and other cities, and company officials said they expected most of their 2,400 sites in 50 states to be affected.
Ken Sternad, a U.P.S. spokesman, said, "We are extremely disappointed the teamsters' leadership has discarded the interest of U.P.S. employees and customers by taking this unnecessary and irresponsible action."
With truck horns honking loudly and some 300 picketers walking alongside him, Pat Beam, a driver at the main U.P.S facility in Louisville, sounded committed to the strike, but not thrilled that it was happening.
"We got to do what we have to do," he said. "The company needs part-timers, but they really must do more to give them full-time jobs. When I came here 28 years ago, it was 85 percent full-timers and 15 percent part-timers. Now it's 60 percent part-timers."
Teamsters at worksites across the nation decided to walk out after letting pass a previous strike deadline, on Friday, because they believed then that they were making important progress in talks. But Mr. Carey indicated that he would not let today's strike deadline pass without action, unless there was major progress or a settlement.
After the strike was declared, the company's chief negotiator, David Murray, urged teamster leaders to let the rank-and-file vote on the U.P.S. offer. Company officials argued that that was the right thing to do if the union had its members' interests at heart.
Mr. Murray said U.P.S. would use its limited work force to deliver priority packages, including perishables and hospital shipments. He also said the company's overseas operations would not be affected.
"The economy is going to have 5 percent of its gross national product not moving," Mr. Murray said.
Shortly before the talks resumed last night, Mr. Carey said that if U.P.S. did not address the issues, "I assure you at 12:01, we'll be on strike."
John Calhoun Wells, director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Services, had asked the two sides to resume talks last night -- the first time they had met since talks broke off late Friday. On Saturday, the union gave Mr. Wells what it called a comprehensive new offer that it asked him to present to U.P.S., which is based in Atlanta.
"We had some good discussions," Mr. Wells told reporters after the talks failed. "We just didn't make it."
Mr. Wells added, "We're motivated very strongly to try to reach a settlement and to try to prevent a strike because we understand that there are tens of thousands of people who would be directly impacted by a strike."
Of all the labor contracts up for negotiation this year, the U.P.S. agreement involves more workers. Although the teamsters have represented workers at U.P.S. since 1916, this is the first time the union is carrying out a nationwide strike against the company, although U.P.S. has been the target of several localized teamster walkouts.
Companies around the country have braced for a strike in recent days as they searched for alternative ways to ship their packages. Teamster officials predict that the strike will largely shut down U.P.S..
Many corporate executives have voiced fears that the strike will create chaos in the nation's package-shipping business because U.P.S., with daily volume of 12 million packages, handles four-fifths of the packages shipped by ground nationwide. Transportation experts say competitors like the United States Postal System and Federal Express will be hard put to handle the surge in business caused by the strike.
The Independent Pilots Association, which represents the 2,000 pilots at U.P.S. has vowed to honor the picket line, although the company says it will seek to use 138 managers who are trained as pilots to handle the company's overnight air deliveries. All told, U.P.S. has 302,000 employees nationwide, with more than 100,000 workers -- managers, administrators, sales officials and clerks -- not belonging to the teamsters.
At 12:30 this morning, a few picketers were outside the company's processing center at 43d Street and 11th Avenue in Manhattan. "I would never have thought U.P.S. would go this far," said Jimmy Walker, a union business agent. "No one can deal with a long strike."
A long strike could take a significant toll on union and management. The company's volume was already down 8 percent before the strike as many traditional customers handed their packages to U.P.S.'s competitors.
As for the workers, many will have to cope without the salaries of almost $800 a week for full-time drivers. The strikers will be eligible for strike benefits of $55 a week from their union.
Greg Sweatman, a 44-year-old driver at the U.P.S. sorting facility on Manhattan's West Side, said, "Things will be a little tight, but I can make ends meet."
Mr. Carey, a former U.P.S. driver in New York City, called the strike at a time when he is doing battle on other issues. Last December, he narrowly defeated James P. Hoffa in his race for a new five-year term, but Mr. Hoffa has asked the Federal official who oversaw the election to overturn it on the ground that the Carey campaign received more than $100,000 in contributions that prosecutors say were diverted from the union's funds.
Ever since negotiations began four months ago, teamster officials have said their main goal was to push U.P.S. to stop hiring so many part-time workers -- three-fifths of its employees work part-time and four-fifths of the employees hired during the four-year contract that just expired were part-timers.
Teamster officials repeatedly argued that U.P.S. did not pay part-time workers nearly enough to support a family. U.P.S. pays $9 an hour to part-time workers with two years' experience, while paying $19.95 an hour to full-time workers with the same experience.
The part-time issue was on workers' minds as they picketed last night at a depot in Atlanta. "I never would have thought I'd have been here 19 years and still working part-time," said Victor Fountain, who moves tractor-trailers around the site. "I don't understand why we can't have full-time jobs."

HEADLINE: Drug Companies' Sales Pitch: 'Ask Your Doctor'

BYLINE: By ABIGAIL ZUGER 

 BODY:
DO you have signs of persistent anxiety? Are you irritable, restless, tense or easily fatigued?
It is not your doctor who wants to know; it is the folks at the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company. They spent almost $2 million in the first four months of 1997 asking these questions in a nationwide ad campaign to inform Americans that the prescription anti-anxiety drug Buspar could be just right for them. 
 Buspar is one of dozens of prescription drugs that are now being marketed directly to consumers in an escalating blitz of magazine, newspaper and television advertisements. The campaigns have intrigued patients, startled doctors and left policy makers and regulatory agencies scrambling to catch up.
Promoted drugs hail from all areas of medicine, from general practice with its runny noses, sinus congestion and heartburn, to far more specialized fields. Treatments for severe diabetes, AIDS, breast cancer and other conditions have all been touted in million-dollar advertising campaigns.
Inspired by evidence that patients are fertile ground for cultivating brand awareness in an ever more competitive market, pharmaceutical companies spent almost $600 million last year advertising prescription drugs over the heads of doctors directly to their patients. That is twice as much as they spent in 1995 and almost 10 times more than was spent in 1991, said Competitive Media Reporting, a company that tracks ad spending. Figures for the first months of 1997 suggest that the total will double again this year, making consumer ads an ever more significant fraction of the estimated $12 billion spent by the drug industry on advertising and promotion.
The companies are betting that if they encourage patients to ask their doctors to prescribe a particular drug, the doctors will comply. And there is good evidence that the companies are correct. In one widely quoted 1995 survey performed by the Scott-Levin consulting firm in Pennsylvania, 99 percent of doctors said they would prescribe or consider prescribing a specific drug requested by a patient. In another survey by the market research NPD Group, more than 40,000 consumers confirmed that prescription drug advertising had changed the way they took care of medical problems.
Some experts say that consumer advertising is accelerating because of changes in the climate of medical practice. Relationships between doctor and patient, they say, may no longer provide the necessary context and guidance for drug prescribing decisions.
In testimony at a 1995 hearing by the Food and Drug Administration, representatives of pharmaceutical companies urged the agency to relax its regulations governing advertising of prescription drugs. They said the advertisements made patients better advocates for their own health care in dealings with managed care organizations, doctors and hospitals.
"The simple fact is that the amount of direct-to-consumer advertising has mushroomed because people crave information about their health-care options," said Matthew Seymour of Common Health USA, an alliance of health care, marketing and communication companies. "Direct-to-consumer advertising plays a critical role in building bridges between consumers, health care providers, and the health care system."
"Advertising is information," said Nancy Buc, a spokeswoman for Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories. "Empowering the patient as well as the physician with information increases the likelihood that someone -- patient, friend or relative of the patent, or physician -- will get the dialogue started."
Other experts counter, however, that the advertisements do not empower patients so much as entangle them in misinformation. "I would be as adamant as anyone that a patient has to be well informed," said Dr. Sidney Wolfe of Public Citizen's Health Research Group in Washington. "But the information has to be accurate, and accurate information is not to be confused with direct-to-consumer advertising."
Most individual doctors are still cautiously feeling their way around the ads, new intruders into examining-room decisions.
"It's a complicated question, a paradox," said Dr. Mack Lipkin, a professor of medicine at New York University. While educating patients and getting them to ask questions has been proven to promote good health, he said, aggressive marketing campaigns may lead consumers to greatly misplaced enthusiasms.
"Promoted drugs might be outstanding ones, but they might not be," he said. "Usually my patients bring in the ad and ask what I think. I launch into an explanation of the evidence, and they're satisfied."
Dr. Thomas Lee, an internist and cardiologist in Boston, said: "The patients come in asking if they shouldn't be on something. And they are mildly suspicious that the physician has blown it by not treating them."
Dr. Lee once informed a patient requesting a specific treatment, "I am not a waiter in a restaurant." After a lengthy discussion -- "She actually smacked her hand on the table!" Dr. Lee recalls -- the patient got what she asked for. But another patient's specific requests he found himself rebutting "like a hockey goalie kicking away every shot on goal."
"Many of my colleagues feel that consumerism has gone too far, and is a significant danger to the doctor-patient relationship," Dr. Lee said. "We hate it when we see these full-page newspaper ads for drugs. It's not that we don't think patients have a right to know about these things, it's just that we feel that the drug manufacturers are creating demand where often there isn't a real need.
"Consumerism has a lot of pluses, but it has a dark side too. Patients have been put on edge by magazine articles and horror stories about managed care, and often don't see physicians for what they remain, the patient's best advocate."
Other physicians, particularly those caring for low-income patients, have yet to confront the issue.
"I have not been asked by any patient about the medications on TV," said Dr. David Schiedermayer, a Milwaukee internist who sees mostly indigent patients. "Most of my patients are more worried about trying to get the pills they are already supposed to be taking than asking for new ones."
Anticipating irritation in the medical community, some drug companies now actively seek to deflect it by warning doctors before an ad surfaces in their community.
Novartis Pharmaceuticals sent a mass mailing to doctors in the New York City area shortly before the appearance of ads for Lamisil, a drug for treating toenail fungus, (and before Novartis sponsored the inflation of a giant helium-filled foot in Central Park). Doctors were invited to review and comment on an advance copy of the ad. "We didn't want the doctors to have any surprises," said Judy Glova, a Novartis spokeswoman.
"Our M.D.'s really let us know if we don't warn them," agreed Diane Parks of Hoechst Marion Roussel, whose ad campaign for the antihistamine Allegra also occasioned premonitory "Dear Doctor" letters. "They let the drug reps have it in the middle of the waiting room."
Consumer watchdogs have begun to worry that the fledgling trends in consumer advertising may soon come to mimic disturbing patterns that have been noted in ads geared to physicians.
"I have little doubt that there are patients now in droves going to the doctor saying, "I saw an ad; let's try it," Dr. Wolfe said. "But if you go to your doctor with misleading information, and that doctor is already being misled by advertising, it's a recipe for a prescription being written."
Drug advertisements directed at physicians have sustained a variety of recent assaults on their integrity. A 1992 study published in Annals of Internal Medicine concluded that more than half the ads surveyed lacked key information on drug safety and side effects, and 44 percent might lead to prescribing mistakes.
A similar study late last year in The Journal of General Internal Medicine found that among the drugs publicized, only 10 percent were substantial improvements over other therapeutic choices.
In the 1995-1996 fiscal year, according to Dr. Wolfe, the Food and Drug Administration made more than 150 requests that drug companies pull physician-directed ads for false or misleading information.
Advertising directed at consumers has not yet faced similar criticism, although a small study sponsored by Consumers' Union last year concluded that fewer than half of 28 ads surveyed were honest about drug efficacy, and risk and benefit information.
The Food and Drug Administration encourages but does not require drug companies to submit consumer ads for clearance before the ads run. The agency does require that any advertising mentioning both a drug name and the condition it treats must also provide a "brief summary" that describes the benefits and risks of the drug, including side effects, interactions with other drugs, and contraindications.
This information often runs to thousands of words, difficult to include in some media presentations. Hence the surreal pharmaceutical-sponsored interludes on television or in the subways, in which clouds drift through a balmy blue sky or a man climbs a mountain to the accompaniment of nothing but a toll-free telephone number. Only consumers who call the number learn about the antihistamine behind the scenery.
A new television ad for the contraceptive injection Depo-Provera that was broadcast in four cities on July 9 is the first to provide an F.D.A.-approved brief summary on television, devoting a full minute to a scrolled list of indications, warnings and side effects.
Although some print ads rephrase the required technical information for consumers, most simply reprint the same information provided to doctors. Critics have pointed out that consumers are not trained to interpret this information and most probably ignore it.
When Katherine Riggs, a Harvard-educated lawyer in San Francisco, saw ads for a toenail fungus medication, she read them "with great interest," adding, "Then I went to my doctor and discovered this drug could really do a number on your liver, which I would never ever have figured out from the ads."
The other missing piece of information for consumers in the advertising is information on the drug's competitors. Dr. Wolfe pointed out that while doctors usually know about the alternatives to an advertised drug, consumers usually do not. And information on the comparative benefit of competing drugs is often hard to come by, Dr. Wolfe said. "Increasingly, head-to-head comparisons of drugs don't happen because of the messy possibility that the drug of interest won't be better," he said.
Many of the most widely marketed prescription drugs are so highly competitive because they are medically quite similar. But whether extensive advertising will drive the prices of these drugs up or down is still unclear.
For some doctors and patients, the ads have proven to be a great deal of talk about nothing. "People wind up a little disappointed," said Dr. David Rosenstreich, a Bronx allergist and immunologist. The tools of Dr. Rosenstreich's trade, the antihistamines and decongestants, accounted for three of the five most intensively marketed drugs in 1996. "They think they've found a great new drug, but it turns out it's the same as what they're on," he said.
For other doctors the ads serve a purpose. "Doctors are creatures of habit," said Dr. Jeffrey Gumprecht, a Manhattan internist. "We tend to treat things we suffer from ourselves and things we are used to treating. No one has time to ask every question about every symptom. So when people come in with a shopping list, maybe it's a good idea. They've gotten the message that some symptoms can be treated, that you don't have to live with them, and it can open up a reasonable discussion. It's quite useful. Doctors can use all the help they can get."

HEADLINE: Protecting Elephants By Hunting Them

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Matthew Scully ("Kill an Elephant, Save an Elephant," Op-Ed, Aug. 2) not only makes hunters sound like bon vivants with weapons who manage to bag an elephant just in time for cocktails, but also makes us believe that they are solely responsible for the elephant's diminished numbers in southern Africa. 
 The idea of shooting elephants for the economic development of rural villagers may sound reprehensible to Americans, but Campfire, a program in Zimbabwe under which elephant hunting is allowed as a means of raising local revenue, actually benefits elephant numbers. Drought, competition for land and poaching in Africa reduced the elephant population in Africa from 1.3 million in 1979 to less than 700,000 in 1987. Since the Campfire program was instituted in 1989, Zimbabwe's elephant population increased almost 42 percent, to more than 68,000 in 1995.
Mr. Scully implies that the Campfire program sanctions a Wild West shootout of elephants, but Campfire has strict quota controls on the number of elephants that can be hunted per year. In 1993, only 171 were killed.

HEADLINE: China's Resistance to Fair Trade

 BODY:
American officials are disappointed that months of negotiations over whether to admit China to the World Trade Organization have failed to produce an agreement to open that country's booming economy to foreign imports and investment. But the Clinton Administration has wisely decided that it would rather let an artificial deadline -- President Jiang Zemin's visit to Washington in October -- slip than hastily invite China into the W.T.O. on the wrong terms.
China's economy relies heavily on companies owned and subsidized by the state. For admission to the W.T.O., a country must agree to sell its exports free of government subsidies and to permit imports to compete against its domestic products on commercially viable terms. They must also allow trading partners to monitor whether these fair-trade rules are obeyed. China resists these changes in part because they would prove wrenching. The Chinese would need to make government subsidies explicit and then agree to phase them out at a steady pace. That could throw huge numbers of Chinese out of work before a well-functioning labor market could steer them into new jobs. 
 It is uncertain how many market-based rules that govern tariffs, quotas, subsidies and other trade barriers China is willing to swallow. So far the Chinese have made only timid offers to the United States, which has assumed the lead in negotiating terms of China's entrance into the W.T.O.
Beijing's hesitation is unsurprising. It already reaps, without making concessions, the benefit of "most-favored-nation" status, in the United States and most other countries, which guarantees that exports from China are taxed no more than exports from any other country. Membership would therefore give the Chinese little economic advantage.
To Beijing, the lure of membership is political. President Jiang appears to covet the political glow of leading China, which will soon be the world's largest exporter, into its rightful place in the club of international traders. Membership is also important to those Chinese officials who want to embrace markets as the driving force of the economy. Once China is a member, these officials can use the threat of W.T.O. sanctions as a hammer to hasten reform. China may also anticipate the day when its exports bump against protectionist forces abroad and it will wish to invoke international sanctions from inside the W.T.O.
For the West's part, membership offers an effective way to side with Chinese reformers in converting China to an economy governed by rules subject to international judicial proceedings. The United States would no longer have to play the role of a bully threatening sanctions for Chinese trade violations and could instead let an international body resolve disputes. That would deflate trade and political tensions between the two countries.
Despite nearly a decade of negotiations, the fractured Chinese leadership appears unready to embrace a specific schedule of steeply lower tariffs and elimination of other trade barriers like restrictions on the right of foreign companies to sell products in China or of foreign investors to export products from China. The West will not demand that China turn itself into a clone of the West by privatizing state-owned companies. But it will demand that China, like other members of the World Trade Organization, end subsidies for state-owned companies that are used to promote exports and block imports. China has not made up its mind to accept the Trade Organization on its terms. The West can wait until it does.

HEADLINE: INDUSTRIES REVISIT GLOBAL WARMING

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS 

DATELINE: BONN, Aug. 4

 BODY:
Early in this decade, as the nations of the world negotiated a treaty to head off man-made global warming, industry lobbyists spoke with virtually one voice on the issue of climate change. They just said no -- no to any binding agreement obligating countries to control emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, and no to the very idea that there was serious cause for concern.
But times have changed, and the industry stance has changed as well. Though hard-liners still see no need to force anyone to limit emissions of greenhouse gases, a whole new spectrum of industry voices has joined the policy debate as businesses have examined more closely how they might win or lose. 
 At least one big crack has developed in the once-monolithic front presented by the producers of fossil fuels, like coal and oil, the very people who might be expected to hold out most strongly against any change.
At meetings here, where delegates from around the globe have gatheredunder the five-year-old treaty, these changes have surfaced as a more widespread willingness to accept the view of mainstream scientists that the problem is real and to take at least some action to solve it.
The heads of several large corporations met with President Clinton in Washington today to discuss the problem. The President has promised a strong American proposal for specific levels of greenhouse gas reductions that is still being drawn up.
In what may be the most telling change, British Petroleum, the world's third-largest oil company, broke ranks with other fossil fuel producers recently and announced that it believes that there is now enough scientific evidence to warrant concern about whether human activity -- primarily the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil and natural gas -- is changing Earth's climate.
The time to contemplate action "is not when the link between greenhouse gases and climate change is conclusively proven, but when the possibility cannot be discounted and is taken seriously," John Browne, the company's chairman, said in a recent speech. British Petroleum, he said, "has reached that point."
Delegates to the meeting here are negotiating reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases. The most important of these is carbon dioxide, which is produced by burning fossil fuels. The negotiations will conclude in Kyoto, Japan, in December.
In the conference rooms, corridors and coffee bars of the Bonn Maritim Hotel, where the talks are taking place, the spectrum of industry opinion runs from hard-liners in the coal and oil industries who want no agreement in Kyoto to companies that produce alternatives to fossil fuels and want strong action immediately. In the middle is a broad group with a range of positions.
The dominant scientific view is that greenhouse gas emissions are probably responsible for at least part of a rise of 1 degree Fahrenheit in the average global temperature over the last century. Mainstream scientists predict that if emissions are not reduced, there will be a further rise of perhaps 3.5 degrees in the next century and more after that, with accompanying disruptions in climate. These include, for instance, more frequent and severe floods and droughts and a rise in the sea level. By comparison, the world has warmed by 5 to 9 degrees since the last ice age.
There is considerable uncertainty in these estimates. Nevertheless, Mr. Browne said in a telephone interview, "it seems to us it's time we should do something" about greenhouse gas emissions. "Just because there are uncertainties," he said, "it doesn't mean you just stand still and do nothing."
In that spirit, the company is formally collaborating with the Environmental Defense Fund, a private group, to test practical, market-based approaches to emission reduction. It is taking steps to control its own emissions and to develop alternative fuels and energy technologies. It is undertaking cooperative efforts to reduce emissions in developing countries. And it has assumed the rotating leadership of a broad Washington-based coalition of industry moderates on climate, many of them multinational companies.
The Clinton Administration is looking to the moderates for support as part of a campaign to win public acceptance of Mr. Clinton's pledge at the United Nations in June to seek strong action in Kyoto. Mr. Browne was one of the chief executives who discussed the subject with the President today.
Mr. Clinton's United Nations speech appears to have infused the climate debate with new zest -- and to have increased the lobbying from all points on the industry spectrum.
"The status of industry has dramatically changed," said Dan Esty, who directs the Yale University Center for Environmental Law and Policy, alluding to the period since the climate treaty was negotiated in 1992, when he was a member of the American negotiating team. "There was only one position in '92; today there is a flowering of industry positions." And back then, he said, "you didn't have a major industrial powerhouse like B.P. coming in and saying the time for action is now."
As views have proliferated, so have industry lobbyists. Connie Holmes, a lobbyist for the National Mining Association who opposes any but voluntary action to reduce greenhouse gases, said that when she began lobbying in 1988, there were "maybe three or four people" from industry doing the same. Here in Bonn, there are scores. Mrs. Holmes acknowledges that they consist of "a much broader range of people, a wide spectrum of opinion."
The shift in outlook should not be overstated, though. Mr. Browne, for instance, does not see climate change as a crisis and argues that there is time to head off the problem in a deliberate, step-by-step fashion that balances economic growth and environmental protection. Any targets and timetables for emission reduction, he says, should be realistic and achievable.
Further, industry is virtually unanimous in insisting that developing countries share in emission reductions. Otherwise, it fears, companies in industrialized countries will be at a competitive disadvantage. As of now, the richer countries are obligated under the treaty and subsequent international policy decisions to take the first steps.
Developing countries say those first steps have not been taken, since most of the richer countries have not even been able to fulfill a voluntary pledge under the treaty to stabilize emissions at 1990 levels.
Most companies and industry groups do not go as far in the direction of strong action as does an American organization called the Business Council for Sustainable Energy. Its members include several utilities -- whose leaders have found it in their interest to promote energy conservation, which reduces fossil-fuel burning and greenhouse gas emissions -- as well producers of solar power, wind power and natural gas. The last, while it is a fossil fuel, is viewed as a preferred alternative in the near term because it produces less carbon dioxide than coal or oil.
This group as a whole stands to benefit from controls on greenhouse emissions since its members put a premium on the more efficient use of energy. Michael Marvin, the group's executive director. said "we've got the technology right now" to produce energy more efficiently. Not surprisingly, his organization favors an early stabilization of greenhouse gas emissions, by 2005, followed by progressive reductions beginning in 2010.
A larger group, the Washington-based International Climate Change Partnership, now under the chairmanship of British Petroleum and including a wide range of industries, accepts the existence of a scientific consensus that some measure of man-made global warming is likely. "We think that appears to be relatively strong," said Kevin J. Fay, the group's executive director.
But, he said, climate change is a highly complex, long-term problem that need not necessarily be attacked with immediate targets and timetables for emission reductions. The Kyoto deadline is an artificial one, he said, adding that it is more important to achieve a lasting solution that allows both environmental protection and economic growth rather than a quick "feel good" result. There are probably many pathways by which the objective of heading off dangerous climatic change can be achieved, he said.
Still another group, consisting of electric utilities and represented by the Edison Electric Institute, is collaborating with the Administration to reduce greenhouse emissions by promoting more efficient use of electricity. This program, the institute says, has already brought significant reductions. All of this is voluntary, and the group favors that approach in any Kyoto agreement. It also is determined to get credit for reductions already achieved as part of such an agreement.
The hard-liners have not changed their position. Several of them are to be found in the Global Climate Coalition, a Washington-based lobbying group representing core energy and manufacturing industries. Gail McDonald, the new president of the coalition, formed zeros with her fingers when asked what her group would like to see happen in Kyoto.
The coalition continues to question the science of global warming. It argues that the impact of climate change is too uncertain and that the risk of economic damage is still too high to justify stronger, mandatory action.
The Administration's present course toward mandatory targets and timetables is "an unjustified rush to judgment," the coalition's chairman, William F. O'Keefe, told Congress recently. He likened it to driving too fast in a thick fog. This, he said, "risks a fatal crash."

 BODY:

U.P.S. Strike Is Disruptive, But Vital Goods Arrive
A strike by 185,000 members of the teamsters' union idled most of the trucks of the United Parcel Service, slowing the movement of millions of packages and inconveniencing businesses and their customers.
The most essential goods -- food for grocery stores, medicine and medical supplies for hospitals -- appeared to be getting to their destinations. But the walkout came at a bad time for the book publishing industry, because this is the week that most trade publishers start shipping major titles for fall. [Page A14.] 

G.M. to Continue Stock Buyback
General Motors, moving to return more cash to shareholders, said that it would buy back another $2.5 billion of its stock -- following an initial repurchase of the same amount -- though it kept its dividend unchanged. [D5.]
 
Columbia/HCA Names President
Columbia/HCA Healthcare named a former top executive with the Hospital Corporation of America, Jack O. Bovender Jr., as its president and chief operating officer. [D2.]
 
Stocks Show Modest Gains
Despite rising interest rates, stocks rose. Retailers like Sears and Wal-Mart and technology companies like Intel and I.B.M. led the modest gains. The Dow industrials rose 4.41 points, to 8,198.45, and other indexes showed bigger gains. [D8.]
 
But bonds continued the slide that started on Friday, with the yield on the 30-year Treasury rising another two-hundredths of a percentage point, to 6.47 percent. [D15.]
 
Construction Spending Drops
Construction spending unexpectedly fell 1.1 percent in June to the lowest level since January, an annual rate of $591.5 billion, the Commerce Department said. Analysts had expected an increase of 1.6 percent. [D2.]
 
The I.M.F., in its assessment of the United States economy, recommended that the Federal Reserve raise short-term interest rates to stave off inflation. [D2.]
 
Yeltsin Adjusts the Ruble
In Russia, President Boris N. Yeltsin took what might seem to be an easier approach to countering inflation, in effect lopping three zeroes off the ruble in a redenomination of the currency. The exchange rate for new bills, above, will be approximately 6 rubles to the dollar, instead of 6,000; the underlying value of the currency, after adjusting for the redenomination, will not change. And the Government also ordered a delay in issuing the results of a privatization auction involving Norilsk Nickel, a metals company. [A3.]
 
The Internet Imitates TV
MCI and Progressive Networks, an Internet software company, are expected to announce a service that will permit thousands of computer users to simultaneously receive video broadcasts. [D20.]
 
Progress on Thai Rescue Deal
Thailand moved closer to the completion of a multibillion-dollar international rescue package as economic ministers approved details of an agreement with the I.M.F. [D4.]
 
Kia Gets Breathing Space
Creditors of the Kia Group of South Korea agreed to give the company two more months to settle its debts in an effort to avoid a bankruptcy. [D4.]
 
Health Care Changes in Tax Bill
The budget bill awaiting President Clinton's signature includes two new health insurance options that give Medicare beneficiaries greater freedom to choose their doctors and hospitals, but also exposes elderly patients to much higher costs. [A1.]

HEADLINE: I.M.F. Wants Federal Reserve To Increase Short-Term Rates

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 4

 BODY:
The International Monetary Fund has recommended that Federal Reserve policy makers raise short-term interest rates to stave off inflation, according to a statement released by the fund today.
The fund said that many on its 24-member executive board "cautioned that undue delay in tightening monetary policy could undermine the current expansion by increasing the risk that aggregate demand pressures would build." 
 These board members "took the view that a further, moderate and pre-emptive tightening was necessary to guard against the emergence of inflationary pressures."
Still, The I.M.F. statement praised the United States over all for its "skillful management of economic policies, which has yielded remarkable results." The "continued adept handling of monetary policy and further progress in reducing the budget deficit would establish a firm basis for sustaining the current economic expansion," the statement added.
The I.M.F. plays just an advisory role with the United States, because it and other leading industrial countries provide the bulk of the money used by the fund to assist nations with hard currency shortages and other economic difficulties.
The statement follows the fund's annual consultation with the United States Treasury Department. I.M.F. staff members met with Government economists and officials including the Treasury Secretary, Robert E. Rubin, and the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan.
In a statement on the consultations released last month, the Treasury said the fund's assessment "highlights the strength of the Clinton Administration's economic record," though "we do not agree with every point" expressed by the organization.

HEADLINE: Stocks End Higher, With Dow Rising 4.41

BYLINE: By SHARON R. KING 

 BODY:
Despite rising interest rates, the stock market's major indexes ended higher yesterday, as investors apparently continued to believe in moderate inflation and temperate economic growth.
Retailers such as Sears, Roebuck & Company and Wal-Mart Stores and technology companies like Intel and I.B.M. led the modest gains. 
 After plodding through negative territory for most of the morning, the Dow Jones industrial average wound up with the smallest gain of the major market gauges, rising 4.41 points, to 8,198.45. Despite its lackluster performance yesterday, the Dow is still up more than 27 percent this year.
The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index led the market's advance, crossing the 1,600-point mark for the first time and ending with a rise of 11.12 points, to 1,605.45. The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks rose 3.16 points, to 950.30.
On the New York Stock Exchange, advancing issues barely outpaced decliners, 1,496 to 1,379. Volume was strong, with 456.4 million shares traded.
Yesterday's modest rally came although long-term interest rates, as measured by the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond, have jumped nearly two-tenths of a percentage point since Friday.
That surge was prompted by economic reports Friday that showed stronger-than-expected job growth in July and by a sharp jump in the prices manufacturers paid to their suppliers.
Yesterday, the yield on the 30-year bond finished at 6.47 percent, up from 6.45 percent Friday.
For the most part equity investors remain bullish about corporate profits and the ability of the Federal Reserve to keep inflation in check while the economy continues to grow moderately. And, said Daniel Morgan, a research analyst at Noble Capital Management in Boca Raton, Fla., that means investors are still channeling cash into equity mutual funds.
As a result, portfolio managers remain reluctant to sit on the sidelines with cash in their coffers. And stock selloffs are seen as buying opportunities.
"They're afraid of being left behind, so when the index dips, they buy," Mr. Morgan said.
Following his own logic, Mr. Morgan bought I.B.M. last week at slightly more than 103 a share. It closed yesterday at 106 1/4 a share, up 1 1/2.
"Fundamentally, I can't see any reason the market should be derailed," said Jack Baker, head of equity trading at Furman Selz.
"The big picture is no or little inflation. The economy is performing well," Mr. Baker said. He added that once investors had digested the employment report, they continued buying. On Friday, the Dow was down as much as 118 points but then rallied to close off just 28 points.
Yesterday, Sears, Roebuck finished up 2 1/8 at 64 3/8. Todd Slater, an analyst with Lazard Freres, said that Sears, the nation's second-largest retailer, was reaping the benefits of improved business operations. The company should also benefit from the Montgomery Ward Holding Company's bankruptcy and the expected closing of about 100 Montgomery Ward stores. The chain had been a major rival of Sears in home appliance sales.
Wal-Mart, the nation's largest retailer, was up 1 3/16, to 37 7/8.
Intel, the day's most active issue with more than 17.4 million shares traded, led the gains among technology issues, rising 3 1/8, to 96 3/4.
After matching its 52-week high of 64 1/2, General Motors dipped 1 13/16, to 62 5/8, as investors expressed disappointment that the auto maker did not increase its dividend. An announced share buyback by the company did little to appease investors' unhappiness, said Richard Hilgert, an equity analyst at Stifel Nicolaus & Company in St. Louis.
Yesterday's drop in the stock price was the first for G.M. in six trading sessions. On Friday, General Motors shares reached a high of 64 1/2.

HEADLINE: Construction Spending Fell 1.1% in June

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 4

 BODY:
Construction spending unexpectedly fell 1.1 percent in June to the lowest level since January, the Commerce Department said today.
Spending decreased to an annual rate of $591.5 billion in June. That matched the average rate for the year's first half and was the lowest level since $577.1 billion in January. 
 Analysts had expected the report to show a rise of 1.6 percent.
The department, however, revised its statistics for May and April to show more strength than originally reported. May's spending was revised to show a gain of three-tenths of 1 percent, instead of the 1.8 percent decline reported previously, and the April figure was revised to show an increase of four-tenths of 1 percent, up from three-tenths of 1 percent.
The June report "indicates that construction spending ended the second quarter on a weak note, indicating little forward momentum going into the third quarter of the year," said Marilyn Schaja, money market economist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities in New York.
Cheryl Katz, senior economist at Merrill Lynch & Company in New York, said before the report was released that "we do not look for residential investment to add much to overall economic growth, but rather that home sales remain near recent levels."
Today's report showed that spending on residential construction, which makes up almost half of the total figure, fell 1.2 percent in June, to an annual rate of $256.4 billion.
Still, the housing market over all made a positive contribution to growth in June. The Government reported last month that housing starts rose 4.8 percent during June, the first monthly increase since April, and analysts said starts were likely to rise further as declining mortgage rates attracted buyers.
Sales of new homes climbed 6.1 percent in June.
Today's report also showed that spending on commercial projects, like factories and warehouses, fell 2.8 percent in June, to a rate of $158.9 billion. Spending on public projects, including schools, prisons and sewer systems, increased seven-tenths of 1 percent, to a rate of $136.7 billion.
Last week, in its report on gross domestic product in the second quarter, the Commerce Department said fixed investment in nonresidential buildings rose 15.1 percent -- nearly four times the 4.1 percent gain in the first three months. Investment in residential buildings rose 5.6 percent, from 3.3 percent in the previous quarter, as mortgage rates fell.
Over all, the Government said that growth in the gross domestic product slowed to a 2.2 percent pace in the second quarter from a 4.9 percent rate in the first three months of the year.

HEADLINE: Japan Considers Opening the Veiled Corporate Ledger

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Aug. 4

 BODY:
The word for an auditor in Japanese is "kansa-yaku." But people here jokingly call them "kansan-yaku," meaning a do-nothing job.
Pity the corporate auditor in Japan. The lack of respect for them in this country, and their lack of aggressiveness, shows. One-fifth of publicly traded Japanese companies have been involved in some sort of scandal in the last 10 years, according to the Japan Corporate Auditors Association. The scandal unfolding over the last few months involving payoffs by two big financial institutions, the Nomura Securities Company and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, to a racketeer are just the latest example of corporate corruption. 
 But the unprecedented punishments meted out last week -- which included the suspension of parts of their business for the rest of the year -- show that corporate Japan is under new pressure to clean up its act, especially as deregulation of the financial-services industry is getting closer.
Japan, of course, has promised changes before, and little has happened. But now, this country has promised to open its financial markets to more competition, akin to that in the United States and Britain. Japan's so-called Big Bang, scheduled to be completed by 2001, is aimed at revitalizing the uncompetitive financial-services industry and improving the meager returns earned on savings.
For the Big Bang not to turn into a big bust, analysts say, Japan must end widespread corruption and require companies to provide more accurate and abundant information to investors and regulators. People do not want to bet in a rigged casino.
The fact that deregulation will mean more Government oversight, not less, might be considered counterintuitive. But with markets less regulated, there will be presumably more complicated financial transactions and more chance for recklessness or crookedness.
The United States found this out the hard way when it deregulated the savings and loan business at the same time as Federal budget pressures led to a reduced number of banking examiners. The result was that many of the newly liberated savings and loan institutions went on a binge of reckless and sometimes illegal lending, precipitating a bad-debt crisis that required billions of dollars in taxpayer money to clean up.
Britain, too, having left regulation largely to the financial industry, is now strengthening Government oversight of markets in the wake of scandals, including the huge losses attributed to a rogue trader that brought down Barings.
"One of the most important preconditions is transparency," said Koyo Ozeki, director of the Tokyo office of IBCA Ltd., a British credit-rating agency. "Without that, whatever deregulation occurs, it will not create an efficient market."
That means that the Japanese Government will have to vastly strengthen its oversight of companies and its punishments for wrongdoing. It also means that companies will have to police themselves better.
Both steps are being started. The watchword in companies here these days is "kohporeto gabanansu," the Japanese pronunciation of corporate governance. Many companies are discussing how to modernize outdated accounting systems, install stronger internal controls and better serve shareholders, who until now have been considered almost a nuisance by corporate managers.
Indeed, the type of racketeer that Nomura Securities and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank paid off exists because Japanese companies do not really want to talk to their shareholders. These racketeers, known as sokaiya, extort money from companies by threatening to disrupt annual meetings and by taking up time airing corporate dirty laundry.
But if Japanese executives were not afraid of talking to shareholders and letting an annual meeting last more than 30 minutes, the sokaiya would have a harder time extracting payoffs.
Sokaiya are sometimes hired to intimidate shareholders into keeping silent. R. Taggart Murphy, a former investment banker in Tokyo and the author of books on Japanese finance, said that one reason the Finance Ministry made such a show of its punishment of Nomura and Dai-Ichi was to assure foreign investors, who as shareholders tend to be more vigilant than those here, that the Tokyo market is safe to play in.
Stil, change will be slow, and there is a chance that it will be overtaken by deregulation, which will let banks and brokers enter each other's business and offer new types of products.
"Since we were formerly in a system where a lot of things were de facto prohibited, we didn't have to set up rules," a Finance Ministry official said. Now, clear rules will be needed.
Japanese politicians are discussing raising penalties for financial crimes. In the United States, when Daiwa Bank was found to have tried to conceal a bond-trading scandal in its New York office from Federal regulators, it was fined $340 million. When Dai-Ichi Kangyo was recently found to have tried to conceal its loans to the racketeer, it was fined the equivalent of $4,300, the maximum allowable.
The insignificant size of such fines forced the Finance Ministry to punish Dai-Ichi by suspending some of its operations. Such suspensions must be used with caution because they also hurt blameless customers.
As for oversight, the Finance Ministry has only about 500 bank examiners, compared with about 7,800 in the American Federal system. A ministry official said there needed to be three or four times as many to allow annual inspections. There is likely to be a moderate increase next year, despite an austere national budget.
Japan next year will spin out its examiners from the Finance Ministry into a new agency, to separate those who police the industry from those who promote it. Now, there are often cozy relationships between inspectors and those they inspect.
Masao Miyamoto, a social critic who once worked for the Health and Welfare Ministry, recalled that when he inspected a hospital he would be picked up in the hospital's car, and given a tour of the city and free meals.
"I said I just wanted to do the inspection, go back to the hotel and read my book," he recalled. But hospital officials insisted he go out for a night of entertainment.
Traditionally, Japanese companies have been managed on behalf of their employees, not shareholders. The majority of a company's shares are likely to be held by banks and other companies for the purpose of maintaining a relationship, so there was little concern about shareholder returns and little fear of hostile takeovers.
The return on equity of Japanese companies averages roughly 4 percent, about one-fifth the level in the United States. Indeed, said Kathy Matsui, chief strategist for Goldman, Sachs in Tokyo, Japanese companies as a whole have not been earning back their total cost of capital, meaning that they have been reducing shareholder value.
Some companies have begun paying attention to return on equity. A few dozen companies, including the Toyota Motor Corporation, have begun to grant executives stock options, giving them an incentive to work to raise the stock price, a practice they once looked down upon as resulting in outrageous salaries for American managers.
Others are adopting Western-style management practices. Sony, for instance, has cut back the size of its board to 10 people from 38, and has included three outside directors. Most boards in Japan are made up of the top 30 to 50 managers, with no outsiders.
Paying more attention to shareholders will not by itself mean fewer scandals. But the changes in corporate governance being put into effect should have some influence.
For instance, accounting rules now under consideration would compel greater disclosure, making it harder for companies to sweep problems under the rug by burying losses in a subsidiary whose results are not consolidated with those of the parent company. In the longer term, companies that bought stocks at low prices years ago, and continued to value them on their books at those low levels, would have to declare the shares at market value. At times of corporate crisis, they would no longer be able to sell the shares and reap a huge one-time gain.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bond Prices Slip Ahead Of New Issue

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices for Treasury securities sagged yesterday, pressured by weakness in the dollar against the Japanese yen, a large coming supply of new Government debt and the possibility that the economy is running on more cylinders than previously thought.
The price of the 30-year bond fell 13/32, to 101 31/32; the yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, rose to 6.47 percent, from 6.45 percent on Friday, when it leaped 16-hundredths of a percentage point because of a stronger-than-expected monthly report on the labor market. 
 The market continued to be concerned yesterday that the tightening job market might help to spur inflation -- and thus erode the value of bonds. Some analysts pointed to the strike at the United Parcel Service as evidence that wage pressures were increasing.
But Thomas E. Donne, vice president and senior portfolio manager at Banc One Investment Advisors in Columbus, Ohio, disagreed with that view. "The market looks at any strike as possibly raising wage pressures," he said. "But I don't see the U.P.S. strike over benefits and recent General Motors strikes over job security necessarily translating into large wage increases."
He attributed the bond market's drop in its last two sessions to other factors, including profit taking after a perception that the market had risen too quickly. The employment report last Friday was strong only in the term of payroll growth, Mr. Donne said, and did not indicate that labor costs were growing quickly.
Though the dollar rose against the German mark yesterday, it fell against the yen. The Japanese are still big investors in the Treasury market, and a weaker dollar makes United States debt less attractive to foreign investors.
Also weighing on the market was new supply, with the Government's quarterly refunding of debt this week. Prices often fall before Treasury auctions as dealers try to lower the prices on new securities, making it possible for quicker sales.
But, Mr. Donne said, "we are approaching a point where the reduction in the deficit could lead to lower issuance of government debt securities, which of course could have rates falling because there would not be a lot of supply to clear."
Traders will also closely watch reports on producer prices and retail sales next week, though both are expected to be market-friendly.
Still, Dave Shabelman, Treasury market analyst at Standard & Poor's MMS, a market research and analysis firm in San Francisco, said that because the market would have all this news to digest, its upside potential would be restrained in the near term. "Even if the market comes through the auctions relatively unscathed, it still must contend with both inflation and retail sales data the following week, which will limit a recovery before then," he said.
Interest rates at yesterday's regular weekly bill auction increased modestly, but the results were as expected. The average rate for the three-month issue was 5.15 percent, up from 5.12 percent last week, while the six-month issue was 5.20 percent, up from 5.15 percent.
In when-issued trading ahead of today's $16 billion auction of a new three-year note, securities firms were offering them at a price to yield 6.01 percent. The $12 billion 10-year note to be auctioned tomorrow was offered at a price to yield 6.19 percent and the $10 billion of 30-year bonds on Thursday, at a price to yield 6.44 percent.
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new three-month and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Gains on Expectations Germany Will Not Lift Rates

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar touched another eight-year high against the mark yesterday and rose in most other currency dealings, buoyed by forecasts of further gains and diminished chances of higher German interest rates.
Weaker-than-expected industrial output data from Germany and expectations that German July unemployment data due tomorrow would show more jobless people persuaded currency traders that recent speculation of a rate increase by the Bundesbank was overdone. 
 Traders seeking to lock in profits from the dollar's nearly 7 percent gain against the mark last month pushed the United States currency back slightly in New York trading, and the dollar ended lower against the yen. But the underlying forces propelling the dollar higher remained intact.
Some traders also sold dollars after Robert Parry, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and a member of the Fed's policy-making committee, said low American inflation was partly the result of a strong dollar, and "we can't expect the dollar to keep appreciating forever." But the impact of Mr. Parry's remarks at a speech in San Francisco was slight.
"It seems to be everyone's idea that the dollar's rise is going to continue, but you have to be reluctant to hold dollars at the highs," said John Hazelton, chief currency trader at Manufacturers and Traders Trust Company in New York. "Obviously there's some profit taking going on."
The dollar reached an intraday high of 1.8730 marks, the strongest since October 1989 and the second consecutive eight-year high, before retreating to settle at 1.8664 marks in New York, up from 1.8635 marks Friday. The dollar fell to 118.35 yen from 118.40 yen. The pound slipped to $1.6303 from $1.6318.
The dollar initially weakened in Asian dealings, partly in reaction to tough new currency restraints imposed by Malaysia's central bank meant to discourage speculation in the ringgit.
The move by Bank Negara Malaysia, which limited the amount of ringgit that banks could lend to overseas borrowers, helped increase the ringgit and other Asian currencies that have lost value against the dollar in recent weeks.

Two months of high temperatures and no rain in North Korea have pushed millions of people in the isolated country, whose food stocks were already low, to the brink of famine, reported relief officials returning from recent visits there. A1 

Oil Giant Adopts New Stance
Delegates to a meeting on climate change in Bonn were surprised to hear British Petroleum, the world's third-largest oil company, announce that it believed that concern about the burning of fossil fuels was scientifically warranted. Industry lobbyists had previously denied a link between greenhouse gases and climate change. A1
 
Yeltsin Revalues the Ruble
Russians cynically watched tycoons and bankers feud over the privatization of a nickel mine, but reacted when President Boris N. Yeltsin announced that as of Jan. 1, his government will redenominate the ruble by a factor of 1,000. The move was meant to counter a symbol of inflation, which has led to the current exchange rate of 6,000 rubles to the dollar. Mr. Yeltsin, speaking while on holiday at a health spa, sought to assure wary Russians that the reform would "not be a confiscation." People have until the end of the century to exchange their old bills. A3
 
U.S. Suspends Bosnia Contact
The Clinton Administration announced it would suspend its contacts with Bosnia's Ambassador to the United States. The major European countries have done the same, after Bosnia's three-member presidency in Sarajevo failed to agree upon and name ambassadors capable of representing Bosnia's Muslims, Croats and Serbs. Agreeing upon the diplomatic appointments was required by the Dayton peace accords that ended the civil war. A3
 
Israel Halts Revenue Transfer
The Israeli Government suspended reimbursement of taxes and other fees owed to the Palestinian Authority. The fees account for the majority of the Palestinian Authority's annual revenue and represent a variety of taxes collected by Israel from Palestinians. Israeli officials acknowledged that the tactic violated the peace accord but said the funding could be restored if Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat and his Government begin to crack down on Islamic militants.

Panel Proposes Abolishing U.S. Immigration Agency
A Federal advisory panel has decided to recommend abolishing the embattled Immigration and Naturalization Service and assign its duties to other Government agencies in an effort to improve the nation's immigration system. The United States Commission on Immigration Reform is proposing that the Justice Department, the immigration service's parent agency, retain responsibility for controlling the border and removing illegal immigrants. The State Department, which now deals with visas at American embassies overseas, would handle immigration services and benefits, like citizenship requests. And the Labor Department, which now monitors wage and hour laws, would also enforce rules covering the hiring of foreign workers. A1
 
Medicare Poised for Reform
The budget bill awaiting President Clinton's signature includes two new health insurance options that give Medicare beneficiaries greater freedom to choose their doctors and hospitals, but it also exposes elderly patients to much higher costs. The options, which represent a radical departure from current Medicare policy, are likely to appeal to rugged individualists who resent Government interference with their medical care and can afford to pay more for it.

President Clinton is likely to delay acting on the proposed $368.5 billion tobacco settlement proposal until after he returns next month from a two-week summer vacation, White House officials said. Mr. Clinton had originally been expected to indicate his position on the proposal before leaving on vacation at the end of next week. But the White House press secretary Michael D. McCurry said that even if Mr. Clinton received the recommendations of an Administration task force currently reviewing the plan, he was unlikely to announce his position on it until September. A16

HEADLINE: Honk if You Love-Hate the Wall;
Designed to Save Eardrums, Barriers On Expressway Get Less Hard on Eyes

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT 

DATELINE: JERICHO, N.Y., Aug. 4

 BODY:
Some people call the concrete slabs being built along the Long Island Expressway here the walls of Jericho, and there are many who would like to see them come tumbling down.
"I hate the wall. I hate it with a passion. I abhor it," said Gloria Zvinglis as she stood at her screen door in neighboring Syosset and shook her head at the new monolith towering over her front yard. "I feel like I'm being boxed in. I miss the sunsets." 
 But the walls, part of a 4.5-mile expansion of expressway noise barriers in eastern Nassau County and western Suffolk County, also have their fans.
"Now it's much better; I like this," said Gwang Oh, who lives across the road from a new wall in Jericho.
A neighbor, Syndee Perlman, said the wall has helped: "Before, it was so noisy I couldn't hear myself."
And Chisty Kamrul said, "It looks more private now."
One thing is certain about these latest walls, however. They look distinctively different from older models, reflecting a concerted effort by transportation officials to make them more appealing.
More than 1,300 miles of walls have sprouted along the nation's highways since a 1972 Federal environmental law fostered the building of noise barriers. But as the walls have risen, so has the debate over their cost and usefulness -- and complaints about their spreading a drab blight on the landscape.
The walls, most of them gray concrete masonry blocks or weathered planks, offer motorists all the visual charm of a drive past a penitentiary. But highway planners are trying to change that.
After consulting with local officials and community groups here, the state is installing precast concrete that looks like a wall of tan stone blocks. It has a raised rough surface and mortarlike grooves, topped by a dark red border. The other side, facing the adjacent properties, is a pinkish tan with a pattern like vertical wood slats.
"When they started putting up wooden barriers in Suffolk in 1991, we got a lot of calls that they were really ugly," said Mark Kulewicz, a traffic engineer for the Automobile Club of New York. "The response we're hearing to the two-toned walls is much more positive, maybe because people are more used to walls, and maybe because they really are more attractive."
Experimental barriers along Route 18 in East Brunswick, N.J., feature a "living wall," an earth mound with vines and shrubs. Another segment is made of recycled plastic and still another is wooden with clear plastic windows.
And in Phoenix, officials invited artists to create geometric and American Indian designs for the walls.
"More and more walls are being built, and more attention is being paid to esthetics," said El W. Angove, publisher of The Wall Journal. (He noted that his newsletter about sound barriers, with 1,800 subscribers, "is not to be confused with The Wall Street Journal.")
In the arcane field of noise walls, appearance now rivals sound, said Ilene Busch-Vishniac, an engineering professor at the University of Texas at Austin. "In the last decade, at least half the papers on noise barriers have been on the esthetic appeal, or rather the lack of esthetic appeal," she said. "It's hard to come up with an esthetically appealing noise barrier."
Although the latest walls may be less ugly, the debate over their effectiveness continues.
"The noise seems to me like it's worse" since the wall went up, said Milton Marcus of Jericho. Standing on his curb on the expressway access road, he talked at the top of his lungs to be heard above the din of tractor-trailers rumbling by. Although some noise walls enclose both the expressway and its access road, here the wall was installed between them.
"It doesn't make sense -- our problem was not the expressway but the noise from the access road right here," said Mr. Marcus, a computer mechanic. "The wall doesn't do anything about that except maybe reflect it back on me. Visually, it's not bad. But remember, we had hundreds of trees back there that they knocked down for this."
Acoustical scientists argue the pros and cons.
"The thing about noise walls is they really do have a good effect for the first row of houses, but after that the cost effectiveness raises real questions," said Dr. Joseph Pope, past chairman of the noise committee of the American Acoustical Society -- whose headquarters is just off the expressway near here.
Some government officials question whether the high cost -- ranging from $1 million to $2 million a mile for each side of the road -- is worth it.
More than $1.5 billion, in 1995 dollar values, has been spent on noise walls in this country. The Federal Government picks up the cost on new highways or major expansions, but walls for other highways hinge on state or local aid.
"There is considerable activity in Japan and some in Europe, but the overwhelming majority is right here in the good old U.S.A., because it is a very profitable business," said Dr. William W. Lang, president of the International Institute of Noise Control Engineering. "Contractors are making a lot of money.
"The acoustical efficiency is, let's say, modest, but the psychological efficacy is great in the sense that the barriers block the view of the highway," Dr. Lang said. "As a consumer and taxpayer, I'm not sure these noise walls are all that good, but certainly in affluent neighborhoods the political pressure is there to spend the public's money to build them, and contractors love them."
The new walls here, adding to about 10 miles built along other stretches of the expressway, are part of a major reconstruction that includes new car-pool lanes. Tri-Venture, a consortium of the Posillico, Hendrickson and Scalamandre construction companies, bid $245 million to get the job, including the noise walls, beating five competitors. The State Department of Transportation supervised the bidding.
But some legislators in the New York metropolitan region argue that with government trying to economize, the walls are a luxury. A Connecticut transportation planner, Carmine P. Trotta, said, "Since 1991, we've basically stopped funding sound barriers because of budget constraints."
Advocates of the walls say the best test of their effectiveness is the backlog of neighborhoods clamoring for them.
"We don't ram noise barriers down people's throats," said William McColl, an environmental analyst for New York State's Transportation Department. Neighborhood opposition will veto a proposed wall, he said. "This has happened only three or four times across the state, and in every case, they had second thoughts and subsequently wanted the walls."
Jericho's section of the expressway carries 150,000 vehicles a day -- averaging 6,250 an hour. Although some residents moved here fully aware of the traffic, older neighbors arrived when the volume was much lower and some settled here before the expressway was built.
Walls are erected to block sound waves from pounding on nearby eardrums. The walls here range from 16 to 24 feet high. Although some surfaces are specially designed to help absorb sound, many experts say the results are modest. The choice of materials like wood and concrete is based on cost, appearance or maintenance considerations rather than sound absorption.
"We strive to get a reduction of about 10 decibels, which a person in the community would perceive as a halving of the noise level," Mr. McColl said.
Properly designed walls "work very well" for adjacent residents, contends Mr. Angove, the newsletter editor. "Four blocks away they think it's a waste of money, but I've been at a lot of community meetings and in the backyards of a lot of people next to the highway after the walls go up, and you walk around with them and they say, 'Oh, my God, this is wonderful!"'
But for Alisa Chafitz, who lives across the street from the end of a new wall here, the change in sound and sight seems negligible. "It's actually pretty much the same," she said, "because there were a lot of trees they knocked down for the wall. Either way, the view's not great."

HEADLINE: THE U.P.S. WALKOUT: NEWS ANALYSIS;
High Stakes for 2 Titans

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
The walkout against United Parcel Service stems from the inevitable clash of two powerful forces in the nation's economy: the revitalized labor movement's opposition to the use of part-time workers and corporate America's insistence that it needs such workers to remain competitive.
That collision pushed the International Brotherhood of Teamsters to begin a strike yesterday morning against 2,400 United Parcel depots -- a high-stakes high-visibility move that involves more workers than any other strike this decade. 
 Even before the 185,000 drivers, loaders and sorters walked out, the teamsters' union drew a line in the sand over the issue of part-time workers.
At a time when the economy and United Parcel profits are booming, the teamsters are angry that of the 46,000 unionized jobs that the company has created since 1993, only 8,000 have been full-time. The part-time jobs pay $9 an hour, on average after two years, while full-time jobs pay $19.95 an hour.
In an era in which flexibility and speed are corporate watchwords, United Parcel sees the lower-paid part-timers as an economic lifeline. In a quick-turnaround business, corporate officials say, United Parcel needs thousands of people to sort packages and load trucks part-time from 4 A.M. to 8 A.M., not from 4 A.M. to noon.
"Over the last five years, part-time work has shifted from being an occasional strategy to being a way of life at U.P.S.," said Harley Shaiken, a professor of industrial relations at the University of California at Berkeley. "That's why there is the anger right now. For U.P.S. workers it represents, in effect, a hidden downsizing."
There are high stakes, indeed, in this clash, and not just because the strike has created chaos for some retailers and catalogue companies. The showdown pits one of the most powerful unions against the nation's largest shipping company.
The dispute is also one of the rare instances when a union has walked out over a two-tier wage system, a system that many unions regret having accepted in the 1980's.
If management retains the right to create as many lower-paid part-time jobs as it wants, employers everywhere are most likely to feel emboldened to rely on part-timers and other cost-cutting techniques that unions detest.
If the teamsters limit the use of part-timers at United Parcel, that could not only encourage other unions to confront managements over part-timers, but also enable the labor movement to trumpet a little louder that it is alive and kicking.
"This is a very important strike," said John T. Schmitt, an economist with the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal research group. "You have a company that is a textbook example of the new economy, a service sector industry that's highly computerized, that's based on information, organization and smarts. If this kind of company cannot offer workers middle-class wages, if it pays $8.50 an hour instead of $20, that's a bad omen for the future."
The teamsters desperately need to win the dispute. For the 1.4 million-member union, which has struggled for five years to shed its corrupt autocratic image, fighting the use of part-timers has become nothing short of a crusade. When the union polled United Parcel workers about the issues to focus on, the workers -- three-fifths part-timers -- not surprisingly told their bargainers to concentrate on turning more part-time jobs into full-time ones.
The union president, Ronald Carey, who is mired in a fund-raising scandal, has not hesitated to embrace the issue as a way of rallying his troops. For Mr. Carey, a longtime United Parcel driver in New York City, the dispute is also an opportunity to show the world that this is a new teamsters' union, one willing to go toe to toe with employers, rather than make backroom deals with them.
"U.P.S. wants throwaway jobs that no one can live on," a spokesman for the union, Rand Wilson, said. "It's time that somebody stood up to them and said: 'This is not the right direction for America. This is not the right direction for our communities and for working families.' "
The company sees the strike as a chance to stand up and say there is nothing wrong with hiring part-timers, who nationally represent 18 percent the nation's work force. Indeed, United Parcel says using part-timers has been pivotal to its huge growth over the last four years, when it added the 46,000 workers.
The company, whose headquarters are in Atlanta, has relied heavily on part-time sorters for its fast-growing overnight air-delivery business. And executives say United Parcel has also needed an army of part-timers to enter information into computers so the company can offer customers the ability to track deliveries every step of the way.
The company's chief negotiator, David Murray, said: "It's significant to note that a whole lot of our part-time employees want part-time work. We have a lot of college students working as part-timers, paying their way through college."
In a news conference yesterday, United Parcel executives said with considerable pride that over the last four years they had moved 13,000 part-time workers to full-time jobs. Their contract proposal calls for turning an additional 11,000 part-timers into full-timers over the next five years, a number that the union says is far too small.
Some U.P.S. executives assert that the part-time issue is a smokescreen, suggesting that the union's real complaint is with a company proposal to set up a new pension plan and pull out of the existing multi-employer plan, in which United Parcel is by far the biggest contributor.
Union officials call that assertion ridiculous. The union, they note, has made clear for a year that the talks would focus on part-time work.
The teamsters have methodically planned the strike, and as a result an overwhelming majority of members honored the picket line.
That is far cry from a one-day strike in 1994 that Mr. Carey called on a moment's notice when United Parcel demanded that drivers lift heavier loads. Four-fifths of the workers ignored that strike call because of poor planning and because Mr. Carey's many opponents did little to publicize the strike.
Speaking privately, some company executives said Mr. Carey had an improper behind-the-scenes agenda in this dispute. They suggested that by calling a strike, he is trying to divert attention from a scandal in which Federal prosecutors say a fund-raiser for Mr. Carey engineered an illegal scheme in which more than $100,000 in union money was diverted to Mr. Carey's re-election campaign.
In December, Mr. Carey eked out a victory against James P. Hoffa, son of the teamsters' famous leader. But Mr. Hoffa is now demanding that the election be thrown out, because of all the questionable contributions that Mr. Carey received. Teamster officials say Mr. Carey knew nothing about the donations.
"This strike is really due to unstable internal union politics," said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a professor of business administration at Emory University.
But Mr. Wilson, the union spokesman, said the strike was over the quality of the jobs of tomorrow.
"Our workers tell us their No. 1 priority is full-time jobs," he said. "People are cobbling together part-time jobs to make a living. They're working at U.P.S. and McDonald's. That what they have to do to earn enough to support a family."

Chart: "FOR REFERENCE: Where to Call"
With the Teamsters on strike against United Parcel Service, consumers are advised to wait several days to place a delivery order, if possible, to give companies a chance to develop alternative shipping arrangements. U.P.S.'s competitors will be hard pressed to handle the excess. Here are their plans and ways to contact them:
 
Federal Express (800) 463-3339 www.fedex.com
Not taking new customers but will accept packages in its drop-off boxes, where pickup will be two hours earlier than normal. FedEx has discontinued its money-back guarantee for on-time delivery.
 
Emery Worldwide (800) 443-6379 www.emeryworld.com
Trying to accommodate any customers who meet its market niche: Business-to-business delivery of packages 5 pounds and heavier.
 
RPS (800) 762-3725 www.shiprps.com
Serving only its current clients rather than risk overloading its system.
 
Airborne Express (800) 247-2676 www.airborne.com
Not taking any new customers or packages that would normally be shipped by
U.P.S.
 
U.S. Postal Service Toll-free number being set up www.usps.gov
Taking just four parcels per customer per visit at local post offices. Customers with more than four parcels will be asked to set up an appointment to deposit their mailings at designated drop-off locations. Regular mail delivery should not be affected.

HEADLINE: Clinton Expected to Defer Action on Tobacco

BYLINE: By BARRY MEIER 

 BODY:
President Clinton is likely to delay acting on the proposed $368.5 billion tobacco settlement until after he returns next month from a two-week summer vacation, a White House official said yesterday.
Mr. Clinton had originally been expected by aides to indicate his position on the proposal before leaving on vacation at the end of next week, but that apparently will not happen. 
 However, the President is expected to take one big, albeit partly symbolic, step against tobacco before he leaves on vacation. Mr. Clinton is said to be ready to sign a long-awaited executive order imposing the strongest anti-tobacco ban ever on Federal property.
Discussing the settlement proposal, the White House press secretary, Michael D. McCurry, said yesterday that even if Mr. Clinton received the recommendations of an Administration task force that is reviewing the plan, the President was unlikely to announce his position on it until September.
Mr. Clinton is expected to support the plan. A White House task force led by Bruce Reed, Mr. Clinton's top economic adviser, and the Health and Human Services Secretary, Donna E. Shalala, is reviewing the settlement proposal, which was reached in June between tobacco producers and state attorneys general.
Both Mr. Reed and Dr. Shalala have indicated that to win approval from the White House, the settlement proposal would probably have to be strengthened so that it did not undermine the Food and Drug Administration's existing authority to regulate cigarettes and nicotine.
Also, task force members have indicated that they believed that the proposed settlement would impose inadequate fines on cigarette companies if youth smoking was not reduced.
Under the plan, the companies agreed to pay tens of billions of dollars to settle lawsuits by states and smokers, restrict marketing and pay fines if youth smoking did not decline.
The proposal, which must be approved by Congress, would give the companies protections against lawsuits and punitive damages.
The order against smoking on Federal property is expected to be announced as soon as Saturday. A ban is already in effect in many Federal office buildings, but Mr. Clinton's order would broaden the prohibition. His decree reportedly will forbid such once-familiar activities as lighting up outside entrances to office buildings or in courtyards.
Mr. Clinton's order would directly affect only buildings in the executive branch of the Government, not buildings of the Federal judiciary or Congressional buildings, where some smoking is allowed.
But a Presidential order would increase the pressure on other branches of Government, and it would broaden restrictions that now exist for the executive branch.
For example, smoking would be barred in military officers' clubs, a change that would make a Defense Department policy against smoking all but total. The Department began phasing out smoking in most of its buildings in 1994.
Reports that Mr. Clinton is ready to sign the order came today from representatives of anti-tobacco organizations, who have been told to stand by for a signing ceremony before the end of this week.
The President has already banned smoking in the White House.

HEADLINE: Taiwan and Beijing Duel for Recognition in Central America

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: PANAMA

 BODY:
No sooner had China regained Hong Kong last month than Taiwan's Foreign Minister embarked on a three-week, 11-nation tour to shore up ties with his country's closest allies. His first stop was Honduras, where he and his Central American counterparts issued a joint declaration condemning China's designs on Taiwan.
Though half a world away from East Asia, Central America has in recent years emerged as one of the main battlegrounds in the decades-old diplomatic struggle between China and Taiwan. Now, with Hong Kong under Chinese control, the scope and intensity of the contest between Communist Party leaders in Beijing and the prosperous island they regard as a renegade province have rapidly risen to new levels in this region. 
 Of the 30 countries that recognize the Republic of China on Taiwan, rather than the People's Republic of China in Beijing, as the legitimate government of China, 14 are in Central America and the Caribbean. Taiwan's influence and generosity throughout the region are traditional and widespread and have led to increasingly conspicuous efforts by Beijing to neutralize that advantage.
For Taiwan, relations with Central America and the Caribbean provide both political legitimacy and a promising market for trade and investment. This region's trade with China and Hong Kong is also booming, but China has been less successful, until recently, in efforts to persuade countries to recognize Beijing.
"There have been rumors that after the first of July, perhaps the relations between my country and the nations of Central American and the Caribbean would be affected," Chang Hsiao-yen, Taiwan's Foreign Minister, said during a two-day visit here, referring to the date on which Hong Kong reverted to Chinese sovereignty. "But those relations are solid and quite cordial, and I have come precisely to seek a better and more effective way to deepen them and increase our mutual support in the international arena."
The maneuvering is especially intense here, and focuses on the Panama Canal, which the United States is scheduled to hand over to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999. China is the fifth largest user of the waterway, while Taiwan has cultivated a particularly close relationship with the Panamanian Government and has made large investments here, including a container port at a former American submarine base.
"The Chinese, both China and Taiwan, have spotted an opening and are trying to exploit it," an American military official said. "The United States is leaving Panama, there's a void, and each wants to fill it."
To increase its limited leverage in the region, China has not hesitated to brandish Hong Kong. Even before assuming control of the former British colony, Beijing had warned nations recognizing Taiwan that they would have to close their consulates and negotiate new arrangements if they wished to maintain a diplomatic presence in Hong Kong.
That alarmed many governments in this region that have made millions of dollars selling visas or passports to Chinese from Hong Kong and the mainland. Typically, a relative or close friend of a president is appointed consul general in Hong Kong, and a healthy cut of the sales flows back into the pockets of top government officials.
In Panama's case, there is also an implicit threat to the lucrative business of ship registrations. Panama is the flag of convenience flown by thousands of ships around the world, including many owned by Hong Kong or Chinese fleets. In the past, those fleets have often registered their vessels and crew members through the Panamanian consulate in Hong Kong; but now they may turn to the Bahamas, a competitor that broke relations with Taiwan in July.
But Taiwan is not standing pat. In his meeting with Central American foreign ministers, Mr. Chang indicated that Taiwan might be willing to hire Central Americans to replace its estimated 240,000 "guest workers" who are currently imported from the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and other countries that recognize Beijing.
During the meeting in Honduras, the countries of Central America described Taiwan as "a sovereign country" and said that only "peaceful means should be used to reach national unification." They also agreed to a summit meeting with President Lee Teng-hui in September in El Salvador.
At a time when the United States is reducing its own aid to the region, the indications of Taiwan's largess are becoming an ever more visible part of the landscape. Police cars and garbage trucks in Haiti, for instance, proclaim in French that they have been "donated by the Republic of China on Taiwan," as do the trash cans in Castries, the capital of the Caribbean island of St. Lucia.
Missions from Taiwan have helped increase rice yields and organized fishing and agricultural diversification projects. Taiwan also helps pay the operating costs of several foreign ministries and police forces in the region and regularly sponsors trips by government officials, military officers and journalists to Taiwan for training courses or "familiarization visits."
China's approach to the region, in contrast, seems to emphasize the stick much more than the carrot. The result of those hardball tactics, it would appear, has generally been resentment.
"You gringos have pushed us around for 150 years, and we never liked it," said the Foreign Minister of one Central American country. "So what makes the Chinese think that kind of Great Power arrogance would be any more palatable coming from them? For them to tell us not to recognize Taiwan is no different than Washington saying we shouldn't have relations with Cuba."
[After Central American countries said in late July that they favored a plan to readmit Taiwan to the United Nations, China issued a letter publicly warning that "they would ultimately pay the price" for that position. President Arnoldo Aleman of Nicaragua responded by denouncing the Beijing Government as one that has oppressed and slaughtered its own people, and on Aug. 3 he left Managua for a five-day official visit to Taiwan.]
Early this year, after a peace agreement brokered by the United Nations brought an end to 36 years of civil war in Guatemala, China delayed deployment of a United Nations military mission for nearly a month to punish Guatemala for its support of Taiwan's readmission to the international body.
In Panama, Chinese pressures have been aimed primarily at the economy. More than a quarter of the $5.5 billion worth of goods sold in the Colon Free Zone each year are imported from Hong Kong, and Panamanian executives are accustomed to flying there on short notice to conduct business. Now, however, they are being told that the Panamanian Government's friendship with Taiwan means they need visas to enter Hong Kong, which is causing costly delays.
"The dispute between China and Taiwan is a political one that ought to be resolved in East Asia and should not spill over into Latin America," Nessim S. Bassan, president of the Colon Free Zone Traders' Association, said.
There are also some indications that China now feels it can play the game through Hong Kong intermediaries. In July the Bahamas switched recognition from Taiwan to Beijing after Hutchison Whampoa, a Hong Kong conglomerate, agreed to invest more than $175 million in construction of a container port in Freeport and the purchase and refurbishing of three hotel complexes.
In Panama, Hutchison Whampoa recently outbid American companies and secured the contracts to modernize and administer ports at either end of the Panama Canal. American officials have complained publicly that the bidding was marred by irregularities.
"It is very hard to distinguish Hutchison Whampoa capital from mainland China capital," Mr. Chang, the Taiwanese Foreign Minister, said. "Some people say we are using money to buy the region. That is not the case. It is mainland China who is doing this kind of thing, not us. But I think if they persist in this campaign against us, it is going to backfire against them."

HEADLINE: Unlearned, Unhealthy and Mostly Uninsured

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark.

 BODY:
It was 7:45 A.M. when Eddie Breedlove, speechless and grasping a swollen jaw, signed the log at the St. Vincent Health Clinic East here. He had roused his wife and their three small children at 5 to make the 50-mile drive from their home in a rattling 16-year-old Mercury, after weeks in which he had been tormented by a relentless toothache.
"He said that last night he drank as much as he could," an aide recounted, having interviewed him, "and then used a pocketknife to try to get it out." 
 Mr. Breedlove, tall, slender, with a week's growth of beard, was greeted leaving the dentist's office by his wife, Blenda, who told a visitor, "He needs a full mouth extraction."
Mrs. Breedlove, pregnant and unemployed after three bouts of back surgery, said her husband earned $100 a week as a self-employed mechanic, barely $5,000 a year. She and the children are covered by Medicaid, the Federal-state health insurance program for the poor, but he is not. Buying private insurance for himself could consume all he earns, and so he is his own physician. Only as a last resort does he settle into his old car for the long drive to the clinic, which caters largely to the uninsured and where he will pay little or nothing for treatment.
Who are the nation's uninsured, and how do they cope?
For the most part, they are working people who cling to the bottom rung of the ladder, people whose only real asset may be a clunker of a car but who -- given Medicaid income and asset eligibility standards, which vary from state to state -- frequently do not qualify for the health care assistance available to the unemployed poor.
Nationally, the Census Bureau reports, 41 million people, 15.4 percent of all Americans, lacked health care insurance throughout 1995. Among the poor -- those with incomes below the Federal poverty line, $12,156 for a family of three -- the proportion was double that: 30.2 percent.
Not surprisingly, young workers and people with little education, low wages and temporary or part-time jobs are less likely to be covered than others -- often voluntarily, unwilling to pay the worker's share of premiums in an employer's plan.Among older workers, more men, and in particular more poor men, are uninsured than women. Among the races, a third of people of Hispanic origin lack insurance, compared with 21 percent of blacks and 14.2 percent of whites.
The uninsured also include 10 million children. For many of them, the budget legislation that President Clinton is about to sign promises relief by making more eligible for Medicaid.
But most of the uninsured -- 31 million, including 23 million employed -- are adults, and the Government has nothing in the works for them.
Dr. William Mason, who gave up a group practice in pulmonology to work as a family practitioner treating the poor at the St. Vincent Health Clinic East, says the general condition of the uninsured poor is often quite different from that of the well-covered patients he used to see.
"I see a tremendous amount of undiagnosed and untreated mental disorder," Dr. Mason said. "You see very poor oral hygiene. We see a lot of diabetes. We see a lot of hypertension and obesity. People can't get good health habits when they're struggling to make ends meet."
Alma Hawkins, who has been a licensed practical nurse at the clinic for 17 years, said: "We are seeing quite a few people that are depressed that we didn't used to see. We're seeing more sick young and middle-aged people."
Some patients, like Mr. Breedlove, still rely on home remedies: putting molasses in an ear to relieve an ache, putting liniment on arthritic knees, wrapping salt pork onto a wound.
"When I was a child, if you punctured your foot on a nail, you soaked it in turpentine," said Dr. Mason, 54. "Those things are still around."
The clinic, operated by the City of Little Rock and the St. Vincent Infirmary Medical Center, a hospital complex here, charges its poorest patients nothing and others low fees on a sliding scale tied to income, with payment plans of $5 or $10 a week. It sees 30 to 40 patients a day. That is all it can handle, and so it does not advertise.
The traffic through the clinic runs the gamut of the uninsured and the underinsured.
Most of the patients are among the nation's 23 million uninsured working adults, whose numbers are likely to grow as the overhaul of the welfare system drives more off the Medicaid rolls.
Others are the underinsured, who have lost out to the quirks of regulation and the limitations of Medicare, Medicaid and private plans. The Arkansas Medicaid program, for example, will pay for the pulling of teeth of eligible adults, but not for dentures.
And although Medicare covers everyone over 65, it is not free. Unless exempt or helped by Medicaid, a Medicare beneficiary must pay for most prescriptions as well as a monthly premium of $43.80 to visit doctors, 20 percent of doctors' fees and a deductible of $760 for the start of a hospital stay.
"We have patients who are working full time but don't have insurance," said Jo Ann Shaw, the clinic's director. "We have patients who have insurance on their children but not on themselves."
The patients, Ms. Shaw says, have been brought to the clinic by poverty and aging, by bad diets, bad breaks and bad habits, or by bad genes and bad choices.
"We have patients who are -- I don't want to say illiterate -- unlearned," she said. "They don't understand why they should see a doctor. Or they don't go to the doctor until they have a severe attack of something. You have to be nonjudgmental in this type of setting."
It is because of their ignorance, or simply because of poverty, that patients rely on their own devices to try to cope with turns in their health. "They'll take half as much medication as required, to stretch it," Ms. Shaw said. "Or when they're prescribed two linked medicines, they'll take one."
A young uninsured man, about 20, stopped by the clinic the other day on friends' advice. He had been bitten on a finger and on his neck in a fight the night before. A nurse gave him a tetanus shot, and he was charged $3.50. She advised him to come back when a doctor was in, because she had found that he also had strep throat.
Another patient was Elizabeth Oliver, who has diabetes. She is 31, the unemployed wife of a $5-an-hour van driver who has no insurance for himself or for her.
By previous marriages, they have two children: Christina, 6, and Christine, 12. The children have Medicaid, which paid for Christina's silver metal replacements for seven baby teeth.
"She doesn't like brushing," Ms. Oliver said.
Christina's head was wrapped in gauze that covered three stitches she had received at a hospital emergency room the day before. Her mother's car had struck the back of a pickup waiting at a stop sign.
"They gave me two tickets," Ms. Oliver said. "They said I was driving too close and I didn't have a license. I've never had a license."
Not all the clinic's patients are in need of urgent care. Some are uninsured young adults in robust health who pay the low fees for a flu shot or for dental work. Anita Lewallen, 22, who was having a tooth filled, works 30 hours a week at a blood plasma bank for $5.74 an hour and is a student at the University of Central Arkansas.
"I used to have some insurance," Ms. Lewallen said, "but I couldn't afford it. It went from $64 a month to $103 a month in three years. I never used it anyway."
Vallery Nix, 20, works at a dry cleaner for $5.75 an hour. Her two children have Medicaid, but she is uncovered. Under her employer's plan, she would have to pay $36 a week.
"I'm not a sick person," said Ms. Nix, who was having her teeth cleaned. "I go to the dentist once a year."
But then there are young adults like Jamillah Junior, 20, a single mother. She has Medicaid for her 2-year-old son but not for herself, in part because she was recently working and, now receiving an unemployment check of $97 a week, cannot qualify. She earned $6 an hour as a temporary office worker but was dismissed in December.
"I was lifting boxes and hurt my back real bad," Ms. Junior said. "I have sclerosis in my back." Her right arm hurts, from the shoulder to her hand. Without warning, her knees buckle, and she falls. "I lose a job just getting up and walking around."
When she was a toddler, her knees would go out, said her mother, Allene Junior, 44, a guard at a women's prison who has complete coverage for herself and the two of her five children who are still minors. "Her back goes out," the elder Ms. Junior said. "And she doesn't scheme. She got fired because of a medical problem."
The mother was angry. "It seems money goes here and money goes there," she said, "but what about the people? You got people here that really need help and don't scheme."
Dwight Smith, 33, sat in the waiting room, hugging his ribs and rocking in pain from a toothache. The single father of two children who have Medicaid, he earns $6.50 an hour, or about $13,000 a year, as a full-time forklift driver at an animal feed warehouse. His employer does not offer insurance, and he is ineligible for Medicaid himself.
"You know it when you need a tooth pulled," Mr. Smith said. Since the winter, he said, "I tried to just let it go and take its course." Now it was July.
Like Mr. Breedlove, he had tried his own remedies. He had tried swilling baking powder and salt. He had tried stuffing the hole in the tooth with tobacco.
"I'd take some Tylenol," he said, "and crunch it up and put it in there and let it sit."
The dentist, Dr. Rosetta Shelby-Calvin, said: "We have preventive care. But the preponderance of care I do is because of hurt. That's what gets them in the door."

HEADLINE: Relief Teams Say North Korea Faces Vast Drought Emergency

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Aug. 4

 BODY:
Relief officials allowed to visit North Korea over the last several weeks say that a drought may be pushing millions of people in the reclusive country to the brink of starvation and that they have not seen such severe malnutrition since the famines in Ethiopia and Somalia.
The drought -- more than 60 days with no rain and temperatures in the 90's -- arrived after food stocks were already severely depleted by two years of floods and decades of economic ruin wrought by the most bizarre of Communist systems, which is now struggling to feed itself without allies. 
 The relief officials acknowledged that they could not move freely in North Korea and that their visits were tightly controlled by Communist authorities, making the extent of what some experts have called an "invisible" catastrophe hard to gauge. North Korean officials themselves, who have long tutored their population in a philosophy of self-reliance, often appear ambivalent about how dire a picture they want to paint for the outside world.
Foreign reporters are barred from visiting the country.
There have been mounting reports in recent months of widespread food shortages. But the drought of the last two months, American Government and relief officials said, has significantly worsened the situation.
"It appears the North Koreans are going from bad to worse," a senior American official in Washington said today. "They were dead on their feet economically for years. Then came the floods. Then a drought."
The official acknowledged that the United States does not yet have a full grasp of the extent of the food shortages, but he said, "What we do know is that there is serious malnutrition across the country. I have no doubt that there are people on the verge of starvation, no doubt at all."
The reports of the aid specialists who visited Korea were uniformly bleak. In interviews since their return, officials from international groups and private agencies described skeletal people living each day on "a fistful" of rice and children too weak to stand.
"We saw children in institutions who are at the level of malnutrition comparable to the mid-80's drought in Ethiopia," said Dr. Milton Amayun, a physician who had just returned from conducting the first systematic measurements of children to determine their level of malnutrition.
Trevor Rowe, spokesman for the United Nations World Food Program, came to a similarly grim conclusion. "The difference is that in Ethiopia and Somalia you had pockets that were affected because of drought or war, but it wasn't a generalized phenomenon," he said. "In North Korea it is far more generalized. As the food goes down, everyone is suffering."
Most relief specialists permitted to enter were limited to seeing institutions where their own aid money was spent, and spontaneous visits to private homes were rare. But most aid officials now returning from a third or fourth trip say they have seen the health of North Koreans deteriorate on each visit.
"During winter, malnutrition is sometimes camouflaged" by many layers of clothing, said Dr. Amayun, who toured the country for World Vision, a private group. "But now in summer, we could really tell how stunted they were and how thin were their arms and legs."
Today four United Nations agencies and two independent groups said in a joint statement that the drought had already cost North Korea 70 percent of this year's corn crop, withering virtually all plants not irrigated. Falling water levels will soon threaten rice crops as well, they said.
The country of 24 million people, most of whom are already subjected to strict food rationing, had hoped to harvest four million tons of food this year. Projections now show that at least 1.5 million tons will be lost.
The United States has given North Korea $60.4 million in food aid since September 1995 and is prepared to contribute more if necessary, a State Department official said. But the United States, which has no diplomatic representation in North Korea, is also pressing Pyongyang to allow Americans to monitor future shipments and to assess the situation in the country. Officials in the United States, South Korea and other Asian nations have expressed concern that a potentially huge number of people could try to flee North Korea in desperation.
The relief officials who recently returned from North Korea said that in July the sights in the countryside were startling.
"Flying over the northeast in a chopper from Pyongyang to Hamhung and Chongjin provides stark visual data on the extent and severity of the drought," an official from the World Food Program wrote to the group's headquarters in Rome. "Vast expanses of parched, arid land; fields with barely a hint of green crops; fields that were planted in the past lying barren and deserted; much of the hillside and mountainside stripped of trees, exposing sandy soil, rocky outcrops and scrub vegetation.
"The sense I got was one of exhaustion -- parched, dried, exhausted land," he added.
In an telephone interview today from Pyongyang, Bergitta Kalgren, the World Food Program's representative in North Korea, said that reservoirs were drying up everywhere, and that residents of the capital were experiencing breaks in the urban water supply.
A Food and Agriculture Organization specialist said today that the situation is "absolutely disastrous."
Today, North Korea will for the first time be taking part in preliminary talks with South Korea, China and the United States that could lay the ground for a peace conference to reduce tensions in the Korean Peninsula. Relief officials familiar with North Korea, suggest that the talks, to be held at Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs, are more important to the North Koreans than they have admitted publicly.
Although the United States and other governments say that their aid is not politically conditioned, many officials say they believe that only if North Korea appears more cooperative in dealing with South Korea, Japan and other nations, will Pyongyang have a hope of getting major international aid.
The World Food Program, which has raised more than $120 million in emergency aid to North Korea from governments and private donors, has developed a monitoring system to insure that the food reaches the right people.
North Korea's two million government officials and army soldiers have their own system of acquiring and distributing food for themselves -- siphoning off much of what is produced within the country -- and they never go without.
The relief group has thus so far focused on supplying mostly children up to six years old, hospitals and some geographic areas where crops were lost to floods in 1995 and 1996. Another $75 million in aid or commodities has been provided directly by governments and private groups.
Relief officials say that famine and starvation occur only after a confluence of failures -- economic, environmental and political -- but that no single event, like drought alone, would be enough to cause such widespread calamity.
Continuing economic mismanagement and decades of outdated agricultural policies, including a lack of crop rotation and the inadequate use of fertilizers, have made North Korea vulnerable to such a disaster.
This summer's monsoon rains arrived in South Korea in June, but then veered away from the peninsula and into the Sea of Japan just as they neared the border with the North. Even still, though there is no crisis in South Korea, its economic and agricultural policies would allow farmers there far greater flexibility in responding to such a drought.
No one can estimate what will be needed if famine and starvation appear on a mass scale and among all age groups. Some relief officials believe that older people, no longer seen on the streets, may be too weak to leave home -- or may be dying.
Relief officials also said they fear that if starvation occurs on a mass scale it will be difficult to arouse public sympathy around the world, as the crises in the Horn of Africa did, or that an effective response would come too late.
At the World Food Program in Rome, Mr. Rowe, the spokesman, said that the crisis is very visible to aid workers and organizations, who have made videos and taken many photographs of the steadily deteriorating condition of the population. Mr. Rowe said that his program had seen a "record response" to appeals from governments.
But North Korea, whose government has been hostile to the outside world and has a record of supporting terrorism, is not an easy country to win sympathy for among the general public, said Ted Yamamori, a doctor and president of Food for the Hungry, who has just returned from Pyongyang. He estimated that at least five million people were already being afflicted by famine.
"What we are seeing is not enough pictures on the screen," Dr. Yamamori said in a telephone interview from Scottsdale, Ariz., where the group is based. "People are not really able to understand what is going on."
"They are mobilizing soldiers to carry water to the cornfields," he continued. "You see women lining up to carry water on their heads to irrigate the crops. Fields are scorched. The plants are wilting." He said that people have begun making porridge of wheat gruel and grass.
Dr. Amayun, the specialist who toured for World Vision, said in an interview that increasing numbers of children are being given up to government orphanages by their relatives, who can no longer feed them.
"Children of primary school age are now showing stunting, which means they are chronically malnourished," Dr. Amayun said. "We see a lot of children given up by their parents, who cannot guarantee normal feeding. Most of the children in the Government centers I saw were abandoned.
"But we know there are children born in hospitals who are not being taken home by their families. There are a lot of newborns being brought to orphanages directly from the district hospitals.
"We saw diarrhea, kwashiorkor and pneumonia. We were told there are cases of measles, and that they have stopped immunizing children in a systematic way."
"The children we saw were apathetic, lethargic," he continued. "Many had no strength to stand. They had no energy. The severely malnourished had the faces of old men, with nothing but skin and bones in their arms and legs."
World Vision plans to airlift high-protein food to North Korea this week. For many, said Dr. Amayun, it will be too late.

HEADLINE: THE U.P.S. WALKOUT: THE OVERVIEW;
Shippers Scramble as Strike Hits U.P.S.

BYLINE: By DAVID STOUT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 4

 BODY:
A strike by 185,000 members of the teamsters' union idled most of the familiar brown trucks of the United Parcel Service today, slowing the movement of millions of packages and inconveniencing businesses and their customers across the country.
The walkout against U.P.S., the nation's largest shipping company, began the moment Sunday turned into Monday as the shipper and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters failed to reach an agreement over pension funds and the use of part-time workers. 
 The strike is the first nationwide job action in U.P.S.'s 90 years, and it forced corporate giants and mom-and-pop stores alike to find other ways to move their goods, if they could. Most businesses were able to adjust, but there were exceptions.
The most essential goods -- food for groceries, medicine and medical supplies for hospitals -- appeared to be getting to their destinations. United Parcel itself was able to move a trickle of its usual stream of 12 million parcels a day as managers drove trucks and flew a fraction of the company's 200 planes, giving high priority to medical and pharmaceutical supplies.
For many businesses and customers, the strike comes at a relatively good time: August instead of autumn. Lands' End, a giant catalog company that ships clothing from its headquarters in Dodgeville, Wis., said it was shipping by priority mail, and that its customers were willing to be patient with the Christmas season months away. "One person said that as long as their winter jacket got there by October it was O.K.," a spokesman said.
No new talks have been scheduled, and President Clinton said today that he did not plan to intervene at this time. The Federal Taft-Hartley Act and the National Labor Relations Act allow a President to halt a strike, but only when the national health or safety is imperiled, a standard that so far would be difficult to meet here.
"U.P.S. is a very important company to our country, and there are a lot of employees there, and I hope they'll go back to the table," the President said, hoping persuasion might work in the absence of White House intervention. A Federal mediator had tried to bring the parties together before the talks broke down.
Some of America's biggest businesses, especially those that do a heavy mail-order trade, had seen the strike coming and made contingency plans, arranging for their products to be shipped by Federal Express and other air express companies or through the United States Postal Service. But the extra load on those services was a burden as well as a boon. U.P.S. normally handles 80 percent of packages shipped by ground nationwide, and transportation experts say FedEx and the postal system cannot take up all the slack.
For some businesses, the strike was a crisis.
The walkout comes at a particularly bad time for the book-publishing industry, which is largely centered in New York City. This is the week that most trade publishers start shipping major titles for the fall season. Publishers of educational textbooks are eager to ship books to schools.
New York publishers generally rely heavily on U.P.S., and it seemed doubtful today that other shippers could fill the gap. "We're hoping for a quick resolution to this strike," said Andrew Giangola, a spokesman for Simon & Schuster. "We're certainly rooting for quick Federal intervention."
So were smaller businesses, which seemed most vulnerable. LeBlanc's Harbor Chocolates in Salem, Mass., tried to ship 60 boxes of chocolates by FedEx today. FedEx said it would accept exactly one.
"If this were Dec. 15, we'd be screaming," said Phyllis LeBlanc, whose company sells about $2.5 million worth of candy a year, much of it at Christmas. LeBlanc's relies overwhelmingly on U.P.S.
So do lobster dealers in Maine. Many held back on their perishable shipments, fearing that other carriers would not be able to deliver on time.
The plight of the candy company and the lobster dealers was no surprise to Todd McCracken, president of National Small Business United, a lobbying group based in Washington. "Companies like FedEx are going to serve their biggest customers first, which puts small businesses in a tough spot," he said today.
In the strike's early hours, a quick resolution seemed unlikely, given the depth of feeling on both sides and that no talks have been scheduled.
"We're ready to meet," Rand Wilson, a teamsters' spokesman in Washington said today. But not, he said, unless U.P.S. changes its stand on part-time workers. "U.P.S. wants throwaway jobs that no one can live on," Mr. Wilson said. "This is not the right direction for America."
When a U.P.S. spokeswoman, Susan Rosenberg, was asked about the likelihood of new talks, she said: "Ask dear Mr. Carey. He walked away. When's he coming back?"
Ronald Carey, the teamsters' president, had announced the strike late Sunday in Washington, calling the talks "just a waste of time."
The teamsters' union, like others, has been increasingly bitter over part-time employees -- thousands of them in the case of U.P.S., paying an average rate of $9 an hour, versus about $20 an hour for a full-time job. When the country's economy is booming and U.P.S.'s profits are soaring, it is unconscionable for managements to lean so heavily on part-timers, the union argues.
United Parcel executives have argued just as adamantly that, in an era when a stodgy company can soon be a dead one, it needs the speed and flexibility of part-time help, especially in sorting packages and loading trucks by the dawn's early light.
There was scattered unrest on the picket lines -- six strikers arrested for disorderly conduct near Boston, four in Chicago -- and union members voiced determination.
"I would rather be working, but I'm going to stick with the teamsters," Jim Hoover, a 28-year-old driver, said outside a U.P.S. warehouse in Gaithersburg, Md.
A fellow Maryland union member, Ronald Warren, spoke over jeers and catcalls that picketers hurled at managers who entered the warehouse. "Most people understand that this is a fight for the future," Mr. Warren said.
At United Parcel's air hub at Louisville, Ky., dozens of strikers waved signs and shouted at the occasional driver who crossed through the gates, but there was no violence. "We don't appreciate it, but we're not there to do any damage," said Keith Johnson, whose job includes directing U.P.S. planes to loading docks. "Of course, I can't say what will happen in the future."
Ms. Rosenberg, the U.P.S. spokeswoman, said this evening that the company hoped to fly about 40 of its own planes with management pilots in the cockpit, plus 8 or 9 chartered planes out of Louisville early Tuesday to deliver U.P.S. parcels.
She acknowledged that that would be a fraction of the company's normal nighttime activity: some 200 U.P.S. aircraft plus an additional 300 or so chartered planes serving 400 airports in the United States and 200 in other countries.
The Independent Pilots Association said its 2,000 pilots who fly for U.P.S. would refuse to work.
Anticipating a strike, many businesses had made contingency plans, some involving their own trucks.
The Allegiance Corporation, a branch of Baxter International, the country's biggest supplier of medical, surgical and laboratory products, said it was deploying its own fleet of 400 trucks and was confident of providing uninterrupted service.
But some hospitals reported delays in their package deliveries. North General Hospital in Harlem, which depends heavily on U.P.S., said its incoming packages were down drastically (it was not clear how many delayed packages, if any, were crucial to patient care), and Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan said it had received a half-dozen U.P.S. packages today, not the usual 80 to 100.
Gateway 2000, a $5 billion company that sold more than two million computers last year, said it began setting up its strike plans last week, switching to FedEx, other carriers and its own trucks. "It will have a minor impact," Jim Taylor, the head of marketing, said today. "We are pretty comfortable."
Some titans of American commerce -- General Electric, Kodak, Xerox -- said they too had been planning for the strike, but that some inconvenience was inevitable.
"We are trying to divert as much as possible to other carriers," said Paul Allen, a Kodak spokesman. "But options are limited, so we expect our customers will experience delays."
Harry A. Ikenson, a retail-industry analyst in New York, said he understood that Neiman Marcus, which usually ships only 4 percent of its packages through the postal service, had been sending 20 percent of them by Friday.
Mr. Ikenson gave especially high grades to J.C. Penney, which started planning for a U.P.S. strike as far back as February, shifting to other carriers and the mail. Investors rewarded the company today: its stock closed at $59.375 on the New York Stock Exchange, up $1.75.

 CORRECTION:
An article on Tuesday about effects of the United Parcel Service strike misstated the ownership of the Allegiance Corporation, which is deploying a fleet of 400 trucks to keep supplying customers with medical, surgical and laboratory products. It is an independent company, not a branch of Baxter International.

HEADLINE: Wine Talk

BYLINE: By Frank J. Prial 

 BODY:
MY old friend Alexis Lichine would have been dancing through his wine cellar in Bordeaux. "Look," he would have said, waving a newspaper, "$32.50 a bottle for my 1996. Incredible!"
Incredible is the word for it. Prices for the 1996 vintage in Bordeaux have been set, and it's no exaggeration to say that they are out of control. Two hundred dollars a bottle is about average for the seven or eight most famous names among the Bordeaux chateaus, and $100 or more is common among the second tier. 
 Mr. Lichine, who died in 1988, spent years improving the wine of his chateau, Prieure-Lichine, in Margaux; he was quite happy to see it reach $15 and eventually $20 in his lifetime. The idea that it would one day reach $32.50 would have astonished him. But then, what would he have said about the 1996 Chateau Latour and Chateau Margaux, both first growths, at $215 and $247 a bottle, respectively?
These are the prices of futures, contracts to buy the wine now with delivery in two years. Most of the prices given in this column are from Zachy's Wine and Liquor of Scarsdale, N.Y., one of the best-known wine retailers in the New York metropolitan area.
Here are some prices per bottle: Chateaux Ausone, $295; Leoville-las-Cases, $215; Lafite-Rothschild, $186; Mouton-Rothschild, $186; Haut-Brion, $175, and Cheval-Blanc, $165.
Since Chateau Petrus, the billionaire's favorite, made only 800 cases of wine in 1996, Zachy's is not offering it as a future. When the store's small consignment arrives in 1998, it will be sold in one- and two-bottle units. But Zachy's is offering the 1996 Petrus as part of two interesting packages. Order a case each of Ausone, Cheval-Blanc, Haut-Brion, Latour, Lafite-Rothschild, Mouton-Rothschild and Margaux, and Zachy's will toss in a single bottle of Petrus. The cost for this little collection: $16,000.
For the really big spender, the Scarsdale store will put together a collection of a case each of all 131 chateaus being offered as futures in 1996, plus a sampler of 12 of the best-known wines in its advertisement. The cost: $102,761. For an extra dollar, Zachy's will include a case of 1996 Petrus.
Certainly, the wines that command these prices must be exceptional. It is difficult to make judgments about very young Bordeaux wines, but the general conclusion among the many specialists who have tasted them is that many of them are very good, indeed, but probably not as good as the 1995's and certainly not as good as the 1990's.
But quality, where big-name Bordeaux wines are concerned, is a secondary consideration. Demand is what drives these prices up -- demand from buyers, few of whom would ever drink the wines or would appreciate them if they did. At these prices, wine ceases to be a drink and becomes an investment.
The most insistent demand these days appears to be from the Far East. Buyers in Hong Kong and Singapore are apparently ready to pay any price for Bordeaux first growths and other Bordeaux wines of similar stature. These newcomers to expensive wine are driving up demand in a finite market. Most of the famous chateaus in Bordeaux produce between 10,000 and 25,000 cases of wine a year.
Just how good an investment is fine wine? The obvious parallel is with the stock market. Bordeaux prices have been increasing steadily through the 90's, despite relatively mediocre vintages from 1991 through 1994. With 1995, they really took off, and in many instances the 1996 prices are 30 percent higher than what they were a year ago. Futures buyers are betting they will go even higher.
But wine, like any agricultural product, is subject to booms and busts. In the early 70's, the Bordeaux market was thought to be on the verge of a huge expansion. Investors bought in, despite several mediocre vintages. In 1973, the market collapsed. Famous old Bordeaux firms disappeared, and fortunes were lost on both sides of the Atlantic.
Should the average wine drinker buy futures? Probably not now. Prices of the top wines are ridiculously high. An investor might want to gamble that the wine's value will continue to go up and that he or she can sell the wine in 10 years at a big profit. A collector might be willing to pay just to round out a collection of a certain chateau. But for a wine drinker, there really are not many bottles of wine -- if any -- worth $250 or more.
Even the Bordeaux trade is being cautious about buying futures now. "It makes sense if you follow certain chateaus and want to be certain of having their 1996's in your cellar," said Fiona Morrison, a spokeswoman for the Bordeaux Wine Council. "If not, you may be better off buying wines from earlier vintages that will be ready to drink sooner."
Buying lesser-known chateaus doesn't make sense, Ms. Morrison said. "You tie up your money too long, and the economics just do not stack up."
In fact, there are plenty of good wines offered on futures contracts at much more reasonable prices. Chateau Phelan-Segur, at $285 a case, and Chateau Meyney, at $279 a case, are relatively reasonable in price; so is Chateau du Tertre, a respectable Margaux, at $199 a case. Again, the wines will not be delivered for another year or more, and the money could be used now to buy other wines, like Italian or Californian wines, or even lesser-known but good Bordeaux from recent vintages at much more attractive prices.
Prieure-Lichine is a sentimental favorite with me, but at $32.50, I'll hold my emotions in check.
 
TASTINGS
Caliterra Cabernet Sauvignon 1995, Maipo and Curico valleys, Chile. About $8.
 
If ever a wine-growing region suffered from too much hype too early in the game, it is Chile. The stories from Santiago a decade ago were simply too good to be true. But everyone wanted to believe. The adjustment to reality has been painful but valuable. This 1995 Caliterra cabernet, for example, is clearly better than most of the Chilean wines so highly praised a few years back. The wine blends fruit from the Curico and Maipo valleys with just a touch from the Aconcagua valley, which is Caliterra's home turf. The result is a wine with good body, a long finish, not too much oak and little of the rustic quality that has characterized many Chilean red wines. At around $8, it offers good value, too. The Robert Mondavi Winery is an investor in Caliterra, which augurs well for it.

Lawyers wrangle over the move by Ritz-Carlton to strip its imprimatur from four U.S. hotels.

BYLINE: By Edwin McDowell 

 BODY:
ALTHOUGH the Ritz-Carlton name was stripped last weekend from hotels in New York, Washington, Houston and Aspen, Colo., as of yesterday afternoon only the Aspen property appeared resigned to its fate. Its operator answered the telephone: "Good afternoon, this is Kathy. How may I assist you?" and when asked if this was the number for the Ritz-Carlton, replied, "Formerly." But operators at the other three properties all answered, "Thank you for calling the Ritz-Carlton," followed by the name of the city.
A Ritz-Carlton spokeswoman said that while the hotels no longer had the right to the luxury chain's name, lawyers were still wrangling over it. The issue erupted in the early hours of Saturday when Ritz-Carlton, which is controlled by Marriott International, sent teams of managers into the four hotels to terminate its management agreements with them. The four properties are owned by separate holding companies controlled by an investment firm owned by Sheik Abdul Aziz bin Ibrahim al-Ibrahim, a Saudi businessman. The Ritz-Carlton said it had acted because of breaches of contract, including their owners' representatives' refusal to pay more than $4 million in management fees and cost reimbursements. 
 Yesterday, the owners of the four hotels filed a $250 million lawsuit in New York State Supreme Court against Marriott International and Ritz-Carlton, charging fraudulent conveyance in connection with Marriott's 49 percent acquisition of the hotel chain's assets in 1995. The suit charges that the acquisition was intentionally structured to shift assets from Ritz-Carlton so it could avoid paying more than $200 million in restitution and damages stemming from a lawsuit the four filed in 1995, charging Ritz-Carlton with mismanagement and breach of contract. Ritz-Carlton countersued and both previous cases are pending.
Meanwhile, employees at the Houston and Washington properties, who would not speak for attribution, said their hotels were functioning fully, honoring existing reservations and taking new ones. One of those employees said the hotel was still using the Ritz-Carlton name "because we don't know who the new management company is." Most hotels take the name of their management company.
Ritz-Carlton withdrew its 200 management employees from the hotels, and its toll-free number no long accepts reservations or cancellations for the four hotels. But it acknowledged that guests in those hotels were unlikely anytime soon to experience a reduction in quality. "The hourly employees were trained by Ritz-Carlton," said Karon Cullen, a company spokeswoman, "so for a while at least guests will still have a Ritz-Carlton experience."
 
A Low-Key Reaction
Business travelers are not exactly ecstatic about the taxes and fees imposed on air fares by the new budget bill, but neither are they outraged, judging from the reaction of the National Business Travel Association.
"This may well prompt companies to explore alternatives in order to stay within their budgets, including sending fewer people on fewer trips," said Mark Johnson, the president of the 2,000-member association, who is also the travel manager of the Cessna Aircraft Corporation in Wichita, Kan. "Nonetheless, so long as the nation's economy is strong and there is business to be conducted in the country and globally, corporations will continue to use travel as a strategic instrument."
Still, other travel industry officials questioned the timing of the tax increase on round-trip international flights to $24 from $6. "It's not out of line with what many foreign nations charge for the departure tax alone," said Dexter C. Koehl, the spokesman for the nonprofit Travel Industry of America, "but it's bound to turn away some foreign visitors, who last year spent more than $90 billion in the United States.
 
Fares on the Rise
Air fares for business travelers have already risen substantially this year, according to American Express. The typical business air fare for more 215 point-to-point routes from 40 major United States cities rose 24 percent from January to June, compared with the corresponding six months of 1996.
 
Niche Marketing
Most airlines are offering fares over the Labor Day holiday as low as $158 round trip between Newark and Los Angeles. But seats and travel times are limited.
Such sales are examples of the niche marketing at which the airlines, hoping to fill every seat instead of just most of them, have become ever more proficient. "We've gotten so good at finding what we call 'troughs of availability,' " said Tim Smith, a spokesman for AMR's American Airlines, which is credited with offering mini-fares for flights of two or three days, "that we offer them in selected markets even on holidays and in summer."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Germans' Inaction on Rates And Data in Japan Lift Dollar

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar touched its third straight eight-year high against the mark and a nearly three-month high against the yen yesterday after Germany's central bank left an interest rate unchanged and new Japanese economic data showed surprising weakness.
There had been speculation that the Bundesbank might raise a securities-repurchase rate from its current 3 percent level as a sign of concern over the mark's steady erosion against the dollar, particularly in the last month. Higher rates tend to strengthen a currency by increasing returns on investments denominated in that currency. 
 But the central bank said in a routine announcement yesterday that it was keeping the repurchase rate steady.
Traders were further emboldened to buy dollars on a report from the Ifo economic-research institute of Germany suggesting that the Bundesbank was unlikely to take decisive action now to defend the mark. The conspicuous absence of any central-bank warning about the dollar's ascent also contributed to the rally.
"Now that the Bundesbank thing is behind us, the dollar continues to roar," said Jan Alvarez, senior foreign-exchange trader at Corestates Bank in Philadelphia. "Nobody's coming in putting their foot down, saying enough is enough."
The dollar reached an intraday high of 1.8832 marks, the strongest since October 1989, before settling in New York late yesterday at 1.8792 marks, up from 1.8664 late Monday.
Against the yen, the dollar reached an intraday high of 119.32, the strongest since May 13, before settling at 119.25 yen, up from 118.35 yen Monday. The British pound weakened to $1.6242 from $1.6303.
The dollar gained against the yen on a report by Japan's Economic Planning Agency saying that consumer spending was taking longer than expected to recover from tax increases in April. The report also said that housing construction, an important barometer of the economy's direction, had sharply weakened after showing signs of strength.
It further suggested that Japanese interest rates, which have remained at record lows since September 1995, were unlikely to rise any time soon. Low rates have reduced the demand for yen.

HEADLINE: U.S. Sales at Ford Rose 5.1% In July, Outpacing Estimates

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Aug. 5

 BODY:
The Ford Motor Company said today that its United States sales rose more than expected in July, led by continued gains by its pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles.
The company's overall sales rose 5.1 percent from a year earlier; analysts had expected sales to rise about 1 to 2 percent. Ford said domestic car sales fell 5.3 percent, to 153,407, while sales of pickup trucks, sport utility vehicles and mini-vans rose 14.9 percent, to 200,342. 
 Ford said that the decline in sales of cars alone was caused, in part, by insufficient ordering by dealers, masking strong demand.
"Obviously, we're delighted by our continuing success in trucks," Bob Rewey, Ford's group vice president for marketing, sales, and service, said. "Not so obvious is that our car sales are picking up -- more than we expected. For the first time in a long time, dealers are telling us they should have ordered more cars."
As a result of July's increase in overall sales and a favorable economic outlook, Ford said it would increase its third-quarter production schedule by 15,000 cars and 15,000 trucks.
Last week, the General Motors Corporation said its United States sales in July rose 6.7 percent, which was also better than expected, though the Chrysler Corporation said that its July sales fell 9.3 percent.
Japanese auto makers reported mixed results. The Honda Motor Company said its American sales during July rose by 31.8 percent, while the Toyota Motor Corporation said its sales rose 14.6 percent. The Nissan Motor Company, however, said its sales fell 6.9 percent.
Taken together, the reports indicated an industry selling rate for July of 15.1 million vehicles annually, the strongest performance since March and well above the projected 14.8 million, according to Diane Swonk, an economist at First Chicago NBD. The numbers might be exaggerating underlying demand, though, she said.
"Discounting fleet sales and catch-up from earlier strikes played a big role, so this is still a very distorted picture," Ms. Swonk said. "You have to take it in context. The world didn't collapse in the second quarter, and it's not booming today."
Auto makers are using higher rebates and lower loan financing rates and other incentives to draw customers to showrooms. Incentives in July rose to $1,200 a vehicle on average from $800 a year ago, analysts said.
Still, Nicholas Lobaccaro, a Merrill Lynch & Company analyst, who was optimistic about the third quarter, said, "The market has been picking up steam, with the last couple of months probably being abnormally low."
Ford shares fell 37.50 cents, to $40.875.

HEADLINE: Labor Backs McGreevey, Pledging Strong Support

BYLINE: By BRETT PULLEY 

DATELINE: EAST BRUNSWICK, N.J., Aug. 5

 BODY:
James E. McGreevey, the Mayor of Woodbridge and a Democratic State Senator, who is attempting to unseat Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, won major campaign support today when the New Jersey State A.F.L.-C.I.O. announced it would endorse his candidacy.
With the endorsement, Mr. McGreevey gained more than just votes from the labor coalition and the million workers across the state that it represents. He is also assured the support of the national A.F.L.-C.I.O., which is expected to dedicate much of its efforts and financial resources to the gubernatorial race here this fall. New Jersey and Virginia have the only two gubernatorial races in the country this year, and both states are expected to get widespread attention. 
 "There is going to be a keen amount of focus by not only the national A.F.L.-C.I.O., but also the national political parties," said Charles Wowkanech, president of the state A.F.L.-C.I.O. "We expect to have a full-blown labor campaign here."
Mr. Wowkanech said he did not know how much money the group's national office expected to spend in New Jersey, but he said that during a recent meeting with union leaders in Washington, "a strong commitment was made, financially and in terms of staff."
Nearly 500 delegates from locals around the state cheered enthusiastically after voting unanimously to support Mr. McGreevey. A motion was made to endorse Mrs. Whitman, but no delegate was willing to second the motion.
Moments after the vote, Mr. McGreevey appeared on stage with leaders of the group. "We are going to rebuild this state," he said, shouting above the cheers.
Just before the vote, both candidates spoke to the delegates, who were meeting inside a hotel ballroom here. In his speech, Mr. McGreevey struck familiar themes sure to resonate with labor leaders, attacking Mrs. Whitman's privatizing of state services and the awarding of state contracts to companies that use nonunion workers.
But Mrs. Whitman, who has maintained a strong lead over Mr. McGreevey in the polls, made it clear that she is not easily conceding the labor vote. Last week, even though she knew that the group was expected to endorse Mr. McGreevey, the Governor requested that she be allowed to address the delegates.
"Knowing what the results were going to be in advance, the Governor at least wanted an opportunity to put her position out there," said Tom Wilson, Mrs. Whitman's campaign manager. Both candidates were invited as a result of Mrs. Whitman's request.
In her speech to the delegates, Mrs. Whitman discussed major construction projects she has supported, her job retention initiatives and the increase in the number of jobs in the state during her administration. "I am proud of my record," she said. "That's why I'm here today."
Afterward, Mrs. Whitman said she was confident that many union members would support her candidacy, despite the leadership's endorsement of Mr. McGreevey. Mrs. Whitman has received the endorsement of the South Jersey Building Trades Council, which represents 5,000 workers, many of them in the Atlantic City area, where Mrs. Whitman has overseen significant growth and economic development.
Earlier this week, Mr. McGreevey received the endorsement of the Communication Workers of America, which represents 30,000 state employees, in addition to 30,000 other workers in the state.
Labor is taking a stronger role in this year's governor's race than it did in 1993, when Mrs. Whitman defeated Gov. Jim Florio. Usually, the group waits until the fall to announce its endorsement, but its leaders said they want to have ample time this year to register their members and educate them on the issues. That, in itself, is a small victory for the McGreevey campaign, which has identified the labor movement as one of the traditionally Democratic groups that must coalesce this year if Mr. McGreevey is to have a chance of upsetting the Governor.
In an interview earlier this summer, Steve De Micco, Mr. McGreevey's chief consultant, said the campaign would focus on labor organizations, environmental groups and urban voters. A first priority of the campaign, he said, would be to "activate them, and re-energize them as aggrieved constituencies."

Thais Agree to Raise Taxes And Shake Up Finance

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Thailand, Aug. 5

 BODY:
The Thai Cabinet agreed today to increase taxes and reorganize the nation's financial industry in return for a rescue package led by the International Monetary Fund that would pump as much as $15 billion into the battered economy.
To qualify for the loans, which would also come from foreign governments and banks, Thailand must meet six stringent conditions set by the I.M.F. In addition to raising taxes and acting to clean up the finance industry, it must balance the budget, end subsidies to state companies and utilities, maintain a tight monetary policy, and preserve currency stability by retaining the current foreign-exchange system. 
 The package is meant to assure international investors that the Thai economy is being repaired and to help stabilize the currency, the baht, which tumbled more than 20 percent against the dollar in July after the Government effectively devalued it.
"The most important priority is to rebuild confidence in the foreign investment community," Finance Minister Thanong Bidaya said.
The baht's value soared after the rescue package was approved. [In New York late Tuesday, the baht traded at 27.825 to the dollar, a gain in value of more than 15 percent from a rate of 32.15 to the dollar late Monday.]
The contents of the I.M.F.'s package resemble measures that it imposed on Mexico early in 1995 after the collapse of the peso. Since then, Mexico's financial system has largely stabilized, and the economy, though still depressed in places, has rebounded some, growing 5.1 percent in 1996. It is expected to grow 5 percent this year.
The I.M.F.'s managing director, Michel Camdessus, said he would soon forward the Thai economic program to his executive board for its endorsement. The fund is expected to provide a credit line as high as $10 billion as part of the overall rescue plan.
Mr. Camdessus said he was in close touch with Asian governments and international institutions "to put together a supplementary financing package in support of the policy efforts of the Thai authorities." That was an indication that the I.M.F. would look for financial help from regional nations and banks, rather than calling on the United States or other Western governments to take part in the Thai rescue plan. Japanese help in particular is expected.
The package is less than the $25 billion some economists estimate Bangkok will need to help revive the economy -- growing at its slowest pace since 1985. Some investors suggested that the I.M.F. could increase the amount if Thai foreign-exchange reserves continued to decline.
Ashok Shah, senior portfolio manager at the British offices of Old Mutual International Asset Managers, commented: "The most important thing is that once they have the I.M.F. come in, it is going to give comfort to a lot of international money managers that there is going to be discipline. Effectively, the I.M.F. is writing a blank check, even though Thailand says it only needs X amount right now."
Under the package, the Thai Cabinet is raising the value-added tax to 10 percent from 7 percent, an increase that was opposed by some ministers. The I.M.F. wanted the levy -- a kind of sales tax at each stage of production and distribution -- raised to bolster Government revenue and curb consumer spending.
"Not approving the V.A.T. increase would bring disaster," said Virabongsa Ramangkura, a former finance minister, who worked with the I.M.F. in the early 1980's, when Thailand also received a bailout.
As part of the package, the Thai central bank's governor said 42 debt-ridden financial companies had been ordered to find new owners. The order followed a similar one to 16 financial companies on June 27.
Thai shares tumbled today as the stock exchange suspended trading in banks and finance companies, creating confusion among investors. Trading resumed after about an hour, and the benchmark index partly recovered, closing 15.35 points lower, at 648.47, down 2.3 percent from Monday.

HEADLINE: Chocolate Less Sweet As a Symbol For Swiss

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: VERSOIX, Switzerland

 BODY:
A rich smell works its way through the small factory where Swiss chocolate is being made, the same way it has been for 122 years here.
Christophe Favarger, a sixth-generation chocolate-maker, points to an ancient wooden blending machine, its stone wheels rotating slowly to transform a mass of brown goo into a velvety smooth confection. 
 "It's very old but we still use it because it is better than any new machine," said Mr. Favarger, a member of one of the pioneering families who, more than 100 years ago, created a chocolate empire in this landlocked country, far from where cocoa beans are grown.
Swiss innovators transformed chocolate-making -- wresting dominance of the industry from nearby countries -- in 1875 by adding milk to chocolate and, shortly after that, using cocoa butter to create silky chocolate that melted in the mouth. For the Swiss, tales of Henri Nestle, Rodolphe Lindt and Jean Tobler, among others, make chocolate part of the country's lore.
Recently, however, ripples have disturbed the smooth surface of the venerable Swiss chocolate business. The nation's 36 chocolate manufacturers have trimmed down to 16, with Favarger remaining as one of the few family-owned companies. Like fellow chocolatiers, Favarger is facing a new era of economic change in Europe that is already cutting into chocolate sales and, ultimately, may mean one of Switzerland's cherished national symbols will have to stop being purely Swiss.
Last year chocolate exports dropped slightly -- a victim of the surging Swiss franc, according to the Swiss chocolate-makers' association, Chocosuisse.
Another threat to Swiss chocolate emerged this spring when Kraft Jacobs Suchard had to recall 500 tons of Toblerone, Switzerland's best-known chocolate bars, because they contained genetically altered soybeans, used as a combining ingredient.
Although using genetically modified products, once banned, is now permitted, Swiss consumers have vigorously opposed it, making sales here rather difficult. But finding reliable sources of conventionally grown beans is getting harder, industry officials say, because growers are increasingly mixing conventional and altered beans.
Chocolate-makers agree that the survival of the craft as a Swiss speciality depends on finding markets outside the country, since domestic consumption is not what it was. Switzerland still leads the world, with 24 pounds sold per capita last year, compared with 10 pounds for Americans. This is down, however, from a peak of nearly 25 pounds in 1990.
Because Switzerland is not a member of the European Union, it has also seen its products slapped with higher tariffs in other European nations, driving up prices and making Swiss goods less competitive.
Today, cocoa bean prices are steady, but milk subsidies in European Union countries undercut Swiss manufacturers. These problems have intensified what, until now, had been a gradual shift in where chocolate is being made. Switzerland's biggest chocolate makers already manufacture largely outside the country.

HEADLINE: Idea of Apologizing for Slavery Loses Steam, at Least for Now

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 5

 BODY:
The idea of a national apology to blacks for slavery seemed to fade today as its originator acknowledged that it was unlikely to happen soon, and President Clinton backed away from it -- at least for now.
A White House spokesman said today that Mr. Clinton had not rejected the idea of issuing an apology to African-Americans. But they said the President did not consider an apology at the top of his agenda, or the agenda of his advisory commission on race relations. 
 "The President has really, in a way, put that issue aside and said that's not going to be the focus of his race initiative; nor is it the place he believes we should really start the kind of discussion he is looking for, one that's aimed at bringing Americans together," Michael D. McCurry, the White House press secretary, said today.
Earlier this year, Mr. Clinton embarked on an effort to put the nation's racial problems in the forefront of the national agenda. He has named an advisory commission to work with him and is planning monthly public appearances devoted to discussion of the racial divide in America.
The idea for an apology to African-Americans originated with Representative Tony Hall, Democrat of Ohio, and Mr. Clinton had indicated it might have merit.
In an interview on Monday night on Black Entertainment Television, Mr. Clinton stopped short of dismissing the idea of an apology. But he said that his commission on race, headed by the historian John Hope Franklin, would be weighing the idea, and he wanted to hear panel members' views before making a decision.
"What I think I should do now is let this advisory board do its work and see what they have to say about the apology issue and all the related issues," Mr. Clinton said.
When Mr. Hall first suggested the idea, he said he thought it could start a process of healing between whites and blacks. He and a dozen other lawmakers, all of whom are white, sponsored a House resolution calling for the apology. They said they hoped that once the House approved the measure, the Senate and the President would follow suit.
But in an interview today, Mr. Hall acknowledged that his proposal had not got much support and said he doubted it would be approved soon.
"It's something that I believe in personally," he said by telephone from Maine, where he is on vacation with his family. "It's a moral issue for me. I think it's right. It's raised an issue which hasn't been raised ever and it's raised a dialogue that's very, very important. I think it will happen one day. But I'm not sure it will happen while I'm in the Congress or maybe in my lifetime."
Mr. Hall's idea has generated an intense debate on talk shows and among people involved in civil rights issues. The idea gathered some momentum when Mr. Clinton suggested in an interview in June that he was open to it.
"An apology, under the right circumstances, those things can be quite important," the President said on CNN at the time. "Surely every American knows that slavery was wrong, and that we paid a terrible price for it and that we had to keep repairing that."
Mr. Clinton added: "Just to say that it's wrong and that we're sorry about it is not a bad thing. It doesn't weaken us."
Despite the support from some people, leaders of most groups that are involved in the civil rights debate dismissed an apology as an empty gesture unless accompanied by direct action, though the groups often differ on what that action should be.
"My own view, and our own view, is that an apology for slavery might be of useful symbolic value," said Hugh Price, president of the National Urban League. "But it does not address the bottom line issues of inequality, which are rooted in the gaps in education and economic opportunity."
Gerald Reynolds, president of the Center for New Black Leadership, a conservative civil rights organization, said: "An apology is nothing more than an empty gesture. I don't think it reduces crime or reduces teen pregnancy or improves the public school system."

HEADLINE: Rowland Defends His Cottage Purchase, Saying the Criticism Is Political

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Aug. 5

 BODY:
Gov. John G. Rowland today defended his purchase of a lakeside cottage from a foundation run by one of his political appointees, saying criticism of the deal was politically motivated.
Edward Marcus, chairman of the state Democratic Party, has questioned the ethics of the purchase. 
 "There's only one person that's driving the story," Mr. Rowland said, "and that's, of course, the Democratic state chairman, so obviously the campaign has begun, the political season is upon us."
Mr. Rowland, a Republican, bought the four-room cottage on Bantam Lake from the White Memorial Foundation, the president of which is Arthur Diedrick, who heads several agencies in the Rowland administration.
The price was $110,000, with a down payment of $5,000 and a 25-year, 7.25 percent mortgage held by the foundation. The Rowlands are also paying the foundation $3,000 a year for 25 years to lease the land on which the cottage sits. The foundation owns most of the land on the Bantam Lake shoreline.
Mr. Marcus said in a news release earlier this summer, "Diedrick expects us to believe he had nothing to do with the exceptional bargain the Governor struck on his purchase of a highly desirable property."
Mr. Diedrick has said the foundation takes most mortgages of homes on land that it still holds because it is difficult to obtain mortgages from banks when the land is leased.
Dean Pagani, a spokesman for Mr. Rowland, said today that the deal was approved by lawyers, one of whom was a senior lawyer at the State Ethics Commission.
Mr. Rowland said the arrangement was "very similar" to those had by 35 other people who have bought homes from the foundation. He said that he had called the foundation to ask whether any properties were vacant, and that after learning that several were, he had decided on his purchase.
"I think the average person out there understands that even governors have an opportunity and a chance to buy a piece of property," Mr. Rowland said. "As I've said before, there was no sweetheart deal, everything's above board."
Mr. Pagani also said there was no reason to think the Governor got a special deal on the mortgage rate.
"In every real estate transaction there is a buyer and a seller and usually a lender and if all those parties agree to the terms of the deal then the deal is made," he said.

HEADLINE: Commercial Real Estate;
A Restaurant May Once Again Fill Delmonico's

BYLINE: By MERVYN ROTHSTEIN 

 BODY:
It is a New York City landmark -- the home of Delmonico's, the restaurant credited with introducing haute cuisine to the United States in the mid-19th century. It was a gathering place for New York society, where visiting dignitaries like Charles Dickens dined on fare like the stuffed lamb dish agneau farci a la Walter Scott. One of its chefs, Charles Ranhofer, was the creator of baked Alaska and lobster Newburg.
But the restaurant at 56 Beaver Street, two blocks south of Wall Street at South William Street, has sat vacant since the early 90's, a victim of the real estate recession that turned much of downtown into a ghost town. 
 Now, however, with the upturn in the financial district's office market, and the conversion of several vacant office buildings to residences, the 12,500-square-foot-space, with its mahogany panels, etched glass windows and portrait of Mark Twain signed by the author, has suddenly become attractive to restaurateurs.
"Almost every major restaurateur has looked at the site and has expressed interest," said Francis Greenburger, chairman and chief executive of Time Equities, who with a group of investors bought the eight-story 1891 building that houses the restaurant for $3 million in 1995. "We've had offers from two or three, and we expect offers from several more. We'll take all the offers and try to choose what we feel is the best operator for the location."
He declined to disclose the names of the restaurateurs, but real estate brokers familiar with the neighborhood said they included the owners of the Harley-Davidson Cafe and the Match restaurants.
Mr. Greenburger is not alone in his optimism about the site. "Downtown is finally going to happen," said Faith H. Consolo of the Garrick-Aug Associates retail brokerage firm. "I see three or four famous restaurateurs going downtown -- they're all looking downtown -- and Delmonico's is a good location."
Mr. Greenburger actually had a potential tenant earlier this year. Joe Quattrocchi, the owner of the Commonwealth Brewery restaurants in Boston and at Rockefeller Center, planned to open a brewery in the Delmonico's space. Mr. Greenburger said there were problems obtaining a liquor license, and he let Mr. Quattrocchi out of the lease in May.
"The State Liquor Authority decided that a brewery serving food is not a restaurant, but is closer to a liquor store," Mr. Greenburger said. "And in New York State, a single proprietor can only own one liquor store. So he was denied a license."
Mr. Greenburger said he was seeking a rent of $425,000 a year, escalating to $500,000 a year over a five-year period, "which is less than $40 a square foot annually, for an equipped restaurant in a historic building in a historic location."
The building above the restaurant was one of the first downtown office buildings converted to residential use under Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's Downtown Revitalization Plan, which provides tax abatements for such conversions. Time Equities spent $2.5 million renovating the building into 37 loft apartments -- ranging from 750-square-foot studios to 1,500-square-foot two-bedrooms, with monthly rents from $1,200 to $3,300. The apartments are fully leased.
Previous owners had spent $6 million in the early 1980's turning the building into 30 luxury condominiums, but the residential condominium market turned soft and the apartments were rented as office space. At the same time, Delmonico's was recreated from turn-of-the-century photographs; that Delmonico's restaurant closed in the early 90's.
Delmonico's was founded in 1827 on William Street in lower Manhattan by Swiss-born brothers, Peter and John Delmonico. After their original restaurant was destroyed in the Great Fire of 1835, which devastated much of the Wall Street area, they put up a four-story building at Beaver and South William. At its entrance were four columns reputed to have been excavated from Pompeii and brought to New York by John Delmonico.
An 1838 menu had 11 pages, with 47 kinds of veal, 12 kinds of boiled beef and 50 fish dishes. In the succeeding decades, the Delmonico family opened branches elsewhere in the financial district, as well as at 14th Street and in midtown.
In 1891, the Beaver Street building was replaced, at a cost of $360,000, by the current eight-story cast-iron and steel-framed one, designed by James Brown Lord. The Renaissance Revival building, in orange brick, brownstone and terra cotta, had dining rooms on the first and second floors and a kitchen on the eighth, connected to the restaurant by pneumatic tubes and hydraulic elevators. Two columns from the 1835 building were incorporated in the new entrance. The Delmonico family closed the restaurant in 1917, but an uptown branch at 44th Street and Fifth Avenue remained in operation until 1925.
The Beaver Street restaurant was re-established in 1934 by the restaurateur Oscar Tucci as Oscar's Oldelmonico. The Tucci establishment closed in the 1970's.
The Landmarks Preservation Commission, in designating the building last year, called it "one of the finest surviving late-19th-century buildings in Manhattan's financial district."
Mr. Greenburger, who has purchased five downtown office buildings for residential conversion -- the others are at 15 Dutch Street, 41-43 John Street, 47 West Street and 80-84 Nassau Street -- said he was confident the growing downtown population would provide customers for a restaurant -- and incentive for a tenant.
"There are a lot of people coming down here," he said. "This summer, in two apartment buildings within a block of us -- at 45 Wall Street and 25 Broad Street -- 2,000 people are moving in. State employees -- 1,800 of them -- from various agencies just moved in to 60 Broad Street, a block away. And then there's 55 Water Street, which just leased 936,000 square feet to Standard & Poor's and 155,000 square feet to Chubb Insurance. That's a lot of potential customers."

HEADLINE: THE U.P.S. WALKOUT: THE IMPASSE;
No Talks, and Very Few Deliveries, in United Parcel Strike

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
The strike by drivers, loaders and sorters at the United Parcel Service slowed the company's business to a near standstill yesterday, and for the second straight day there were no negotiations between management and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.
Officials at U.P.S., the nation's biggest shipping company, said they had few packages to deliver, because the company had not accepted parcels for ground shipment since the strike, by 185,000 teamsters, began on Monday. 
 U.P.S. officials said that they were concentrating on continuing their overnight air shipments and international deliveries but that doing so was a struggle, because most of the company's pilots -- members of another union, the Independent Pilots Association -- had refused to cross the teamsters' picket lines.
In a rally at a U.P.S. depot in the Washington suburb of Burtonsville, Md., Ronald Carey, the teamsters' president, said it was time for the company to return to the bargaining table, which the union itself quit late Sunday night in favor of a strike.
Mr. Carey said the union's main concerns were persuading the company to create more full-time jobs and preserving the current pension arrangement.
"There is nothing more for them to wait for," said Mr. Carey, who was joined at the rally by the Rev. Jesse Jackson. "The strike has shut them down. Now it's time for them to get serious about a settlement."
Responding to Mr. Carey's call for renewed bargaining, a U.P.S. spokeswoman, Kristen Petrella, said, "We are willing to continue to discuss the matter with the teamsters, but we must emphasize that our last, best and final offer remains unchanged."
Once again, businesses around the country scrambled to find alternative ways of getting their goods shipped. A common complaint was that the United States Postal Service, concerned that it might be overwhelmed, was frequently refusing to take more than four packages from small companies.
Concerned about the strike's economic effects, Labor Secretary Alexis Herman and John Calhoun Wells, director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, urged both sides to resume talks.
The White House again took a hands-off approach. Michael D. McCurry, the White House press secretary, said President Clinton did not have the authority to intervene in this case under the Taft-Hartley Act, which empowers the Government to seek an injunction against any strike that imperils the nation's safety or economic health.
"We do not find that that standard has been met in this case," Mr. McCurry said, "and it seems unlikely, given the structure of the industry, that it will be met."
Sixteen strikers around the country were arrested on Monday in incidents related to the walkout, and nine more yesterday. These included five pickets who, the police said, tried to block the way of United Parcel delivery trucks in Somerville, Mass.
Labor experts declined to predict how long the strike would last. But Michael Belzer, a former truck-driving teamster who is now a labor researcher at Cornell University, suggested that the eventual settlement would obligate the company to create more full-time jobs than the number to which it would be committed in what it calls its "last, best and final" offer.
The teamsters are angered that 38,000 of the 46,000 union jobs that U.P.S. has created since 1993 have been part-time. The part-time jobs, which account for three-fifths of all the company's unionized workers, pay about $9 an hour on average after two years, while full-time jobs pay $19.95.
In its offer, the company pledged to turn 10,000 part-timers into full-time workers as positions open because of retirement or expansion. It also offered to create 200 new full-time positions a year in each of the next five years.
But union officials are demanding that U.P.S. create several thousand new full-time positions a year. Rand Wilson, a union spokesman, said the company could easily create thousands more full-time jobs, noting that business volume was so great that in an average week, it had 10,000 part-time employees working more than 35 hours.
The company is reluctant to commit itself to thousands of new full-time jobs, however, because it wants to retain flexibility, particularly as protection against an end of the economic expansion.
Teamster negotiators are also pushing the company to raise the part-timers' starting wage, which has remained unchanged since 1982 at $8 an hour for loaders and $9 an hour for sorters. (The drivers are all full-time employees.) Company officials say their offer, which they describe as generous, would push a part-timer who begins at $8 to a wage of $10.50 after five years.
While the teamsters contend that the main issue is part-time work, U.P.S. executives maintain that the real sticking point is the company's demand to create a single pension plan for its workers and withdraw from the 31 multi-employer teamster pension plans to which the company now contributes.
Susan Rosenberg, a spokeswoman at the company's headquarters in Atlanta, said U.P.S. was tired of subsidizing the pensions of thousands of retirees whose employers have gone bankrupt. She also said the company would make sure that the new plan's investments were managed more prudently than the teamsters' multi-employer plans.
"We know that our people will get higher pensions as part of a single-company plan," Ms. Rosenberg said. "In the multi-employer plan, we have to pick up the slack of people who worked for other companies that went belly up."
Teamster officials are fighting to keep U.P.S. in the multi-employer plans. These plans, the union asserts, are preferable because if a company belonging to a plan goes bankrupt, contributions from other employers will help insure adequate pensions for workers at the failed company.
"Multi-employer plans," said Mr. Wilson, the union spokesman, "protect workers from the vagaries of the economy and any particular company's ups and downs."

HEADLINE: THE U.P.S. WALKOUT: THE WORKERS;
Angry Voices of Pickets Reflect Sense of Concern

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON 

DATELINE: WILLOW SPRINGS, Ill., Aug. 5

 BODY:
The pickets signs bobbed like kites in the wind. Clenched-fisted truckers along 79th Street blared horns of solidarity. The striking workers chanted, vowing never to surrender.
But there was more worry than bravado in the voice of Linda Borucki, who has been a part-time worker at United Parcel Service for 13 years. 
 "You look around and it's hard to find real full-time work anymore," said Ms. Borucki, 31, who brought children's books to the picket line to occupy her 8-year-old son, Cyril. "How do people expect you to make it?"
On the outskirts of the huge U.P.S. center in this Chicago suburb, where about 70 percent of the 5,500 employees are part-timers, the striking workers sounded at times as if they were not simply taking on one company, but corporate America.
"These companies all have the formula," said Laura Pisciotti, 30, who rides two buses for more than an hour to work for $8 an hour, 20 to 25 hours a week. "They don't take you on full time. They don't pay benefits. Then their profits go through the roof."
The use of part-time workers and the pension fund are the two crucial issues in the stalemate in contract talks between the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and U.P.S. The union says in a booming economy, the company should be creating more full-time, higher-paying jobs.
But in a quick-turnaround business, U.P.S. sees the part-timers as an economic lifeline.
Those workers were walking the picket line today, a sunny day with just a hint of autumn chill.
Ms. Borucki, drives an older-model car and shares a one-bedroom apartment with her son in Burbank, Ill., a working-class suburb. Her son takes the bedroom; she sleeps in the living room.
"Where would we cut back?" she asked.
A woman at her side, Leatha Hendricks, 36, spoke up in anger.
"People don't even look at workers as human beings anymore," Mrs. Hendricks said. "My name is Leatha, but to them, I'm just a machine. All they care is that you've got some strength in your back. And when your back goes out of whack, it's over. You're gone."
Most of the strikers said they had very little financial reserve to endure a long strike.
George Sanchez, who came to the United States from Mexico as a child in 1979, said he could last two weeks, at most, before looking for another job.
"I'll have to take something," Mr. Sanchez said. "But most jobs are not union. And they're worse than this."
Mr. Sanchez said that as a part-timer he earned $8 an hour, for 20 to 25 hours a week, but had little prospect for advancement. He also fixes cars in his Cicero neighborhood.
"I don't have insurance for my kids," he said, as two of his three children, Jasmine, 8, and Kiara, 3, stood nearby.
Mr. Sanchez's father came to Chicago looking for work, taking a job at a Zenith factory. But he lost his job when Zenith moved its production to a plant to Mexico.
Mr. Sanchez said U.P.S. was unwilling to pay more, or to give workers more hours. And the job atmosphere was tense, he said.
"They push and push," Mr. Sanchez said, "always on top of you."
Ms. Pisciotti, the single mother of a 3-year-old daughter, said she fell recently and hurt her arm, and a supervisor pushed her to keep working.
"He just yelled, 'Come on -- get going, get going,' " she said.
While most of the newer workers make about $8 an hour, some longer-term ones make $14 an hour. A small minority make nearly $20 an hour.
The disparity stems from a two-tiered wage scale that the union accepted in the 1980's, and now regrets. The differences in wages for people doing the same jobs has sometimes caused dissension within the ranks.
Mike McCartan, 38, a part-time worker for 10 years, said he could survive financially only because his wife had a job in a grocery store.
The father of 5-year-old twins, Mr. McCartan is a tall, square-shouldered man who wore a sticker on a T-shirt that pledged, "We'll fight for more full-time jobs."
He said the company had been dangling the prospect of a full-time job for him for many years.
"You can't feed your family on promises," Mr. McCartan said. "You can't make the house payment on promises."
The striking workers carefully watched a car cross the picket lines about every 10 minutes. When the face inside the car was familiar -- a neighbor or a friend -- a gasp would go up, and then jeers.
"No. Don't do it," said Erma Young, a 45-year-old striking worker, as she spotted an acquaintance crossing the line.
Ms. Young shook her head, then cast a look of affection toward some fellow strikers.
"Don't matter if we're white, black or purple," she said, "just matters that we stick together."
A teamsters official stopped at the picket site to rally the strikers.
"We've had reports that some people are going inside, working their shift," said Mike Marasovich, the teamster official, "then coming out and signing, as if they'd been on the picket lines."
As boos rang out, Mr. Marasovich told the strikers: "We need you to look out for each other. Somebody pulls that, you isolate them. You deserve better than that."
Kathy Gedeon, a shop steward who has been a part-time U.P.S. worker for 23 years, said teamster members had taken a more active role in the last few years, as the union has become more democratic.
"People are just now learning what a union can do for them," said Ms. Gedeon, who has a master's degree in psychology, and works a second job as a counselor at a homeless shelter. "We now feel like we have a say-so."
Strikers called today for keeping the heat on upper management.
Marilyn Lange, a 43-year-old part-timer worker, raised aloft a sign that said, "The men in suits are making all the loot."

Mike McCartan, right, vowed to fight for more full-time jobs. (Lloyd DeGrane for The New York Times)

HEADLINE: Electric Cars Get a Big Push In New York

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Aug. 5

 BODY:
In a decision that environmentalists contend will provide a major boost to the nation's tiny market in electric cars, a Federal judge ruled today that New York State can order automobile manufacturers to sell thousands of electrically powered vehicles in the state beginning this fall.
The ruling by Judge Lawrence E. Kahn of Federal District Court in Albany upholds a six-year-old state rule requiring that 2 percent of all vehicles sold during the 1998 model year, which begins on Oct. 1, be powered by electricity. The quota gradually increases to 10 percent by 2003. 
 The case, which was brought by the automotive industry, was being closely watched around the country because New York is now the only state that is mandating the sale of electric cars in 1998. Under pressure from automobile makers, both California and Massachusetts backed away from similar mandates last year and now will not require the sale of electric cars until 2003.
New York State officials estimate that the mandate will require the sale of 7,800 electric cars in 1998, which would be a huge increase over the several dozen battery-powered vehicles traveling the state's roads now. No one is currently marketing electric cars anywhere in the state, officials said, though some companies are offering the vehicles for employees' use as part of test programs.
"This is tremendously important," said Val Washington, executive director of Environmental Advocates, a nonprofit group. "The car manufacturers were not bringing electric cars to New York, and they wouldn't have without this mandate. Now they have to."
But automotive industry officials said the mandate was forcing them to sell a product that is ill-suited to New York's cold climate and that consumers were not yet interested in buying. If anything, they said, the mandate would turn car buyers off of electric vehicles, thereby hurting the market in the long run. They said they planned to appeal the decision.
"Technology and the free market should determine when electric vehicles are ready for the market, not the mandate," said Jay Hyde, communications manager for the American Automobile Manufacturers Association, which represents Chrysler, Ford and General Motors. "If you force them onto the market when the technology is not ready, you run the risk of souring consumers on the technology, which is very promising. We wouldn't want to see that happen."
State officials said the ruling would help New York meet tougher pollution standards set by the 1990 Federal Clean Air Act without creating new burdens on manufacturers. "This is a victory for clean air," Gov. George E. Pataki said in a statement.
The state's regulation was enacted in 1991 under Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, who sought to take advantage of amendments to the Clean Air Act allowing states to impose automobile emissions rules as tough as California's. At that time, California had an ambitious timetable requiring car manufacturers to sell increasingly clean-burning cars, culminating with the mandate for the sale of zero-emission, or electric, cars in 1998.
Car makers twice challenged that rule in court and lost. Then, earlier this year, after California had abandoned its plan to mandate the sale of electric cars between 1998 and 2002, the automotive companies again sued, arguing that the Clean Air Act required New York's standards to be identical to California's. They also contended that current electric-car technology would not work in New York's cold climate.
Judge Kahn rejected those arguments today.
While the state's law may impose economic hardships on car manufacturers, he said, such problems "are overborne by Congress's intent that the quality of the air we breathe should continue to improve and benefit from all available technological advances."
Under the state rule, automobile manufacturers that do not meet their 2 percent quotas by the end of the 1998 model year can be fined several thousand dollars a day, state officials said. The state could also ask a judge to order the companies to reduce their sales of nonelectric cars in the state until the 2 percent standard was met.
It was not clear tonight whether the automobile makers would try to enter into negotiations with the Pataki administration to try to reduce the first-year quota. Aides to Mr. Pataki said they had not heard of any such overtures, and they questioned whether the Governor would entertain them if they were made.
Despite their vigorous attempts to block electric-car mandates on both coasts, some automobile makers have begun marketing, on a very limited basis, battery-powered cars in the West. General Motors, for instance, has been selling a $34,000 two-seater called the EV1 that can travel as many as 90 miles between charges. It takes about two hours to recharge the car. Only about 200 people have bought the car, which is being sold mainly in Southern California and Arizona.
Industry officials contend that the batteries being mass-produced for electric cars will get less mileage in New York's cold climate. But environmentalists say that there is new battery technology that will allow cars to travel farther between charges -- 130 miles or more -- and that are not affected by the cold weather.
The New York mandate will spur mass production of those batteries and bring down the cost of electric cars, the environmentalists said. "The technology has been advancing almost daily," said Sheila Lynch, executive director of the Northeast Alternative Vehicle Consortium, a Boston-based group that promotes electric cars. "I hope the manufacturers get the message that New York wants clean-fuel vehicles."

HEADLINE: Leading Index Slowed Pace In 2d Quarter

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 5

 BODY:
A popular index intended to forecast the economy slowed markedly in the latest quarter, perhaps signaling that any rebound in growth in this year's second half would be modest at best.
The index of leading indicators registered no increase in June despite the continued surge in stock prices, a key component of the index, the Conference Board reported today. Except for a tiny April decline, June's performance was the weakest since October. 
 "It's probably saying that you're not going to get a massive snapback" from the economy's 2.2 percent growth rate of the April-June period, said Maureen F. Allyn, chief economist at Scudder, Stevens & Clark. "If that's the case, we don't have any problems. Let's just hope it's right."
Resumption of rapid growth -- anything approaching, 3 percent, for example -- would increase the likelihood that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates as an anti-inflation measure, analysts say. On the other hand, continued subdued expansion, as seemingly hinted at by the forecasting index, "could lead the Fed not to tighten," said John E. Silvia, chief economist at Zurich Kemper Investments in Chicago.
But as a predictor, the index has a spotty record. It is structured more to forecast turns in the business cycle rather than fluctuations in an existing trend.
"It hardly looks like the economy will pick up in the second half of the year," said David Orr, chief capital markets economist at the First Union Corporation in Charlotte, N.C. On the other hand, he added, the index rose tepidly last autumn only to have the economy soar at an unsustainable 4.9 percent pace in the first three months of this year.
Today's report showed that the index in the second quarter rose four-tenths of 1 percent, compared with a gain of seven-tenths of 1 percent in the January-March period.
The unchanged June reading of 103.8 reflected a standoff between five components of the index that advanced and five that held it back. The main upward forces were higher stock prices and an expanded money supply. Lesser contributions came from higher factory orders for capital goods, a rise in consumer expectations and more factory orders for consumer goods.
The negatives, ranked by impact, were a rise in first-time claims for jobless benefits, a shorter average workweek, a narrower spread between overnight and 10-year Treasury interest rates, faster deliveries by corporate suppliers -- a possible sign of decreased demand -- and a further decline in permits for new buildings.
Two companion gauges of the economy were also part of today's report. The index of coincident indicators, whose components historically have reversed direction at about the same time as aggregate economic activity, rose three-tenths of 1 percent for June and increased at a 3.4 percent annual rate for the second quarter.
Assuming modest increases in the coincident indicators over the net three months, the economy should grow at a 2.5 percent pace in the July-September quarter, Macroeconomic Advisers, a St. Louis consulting firm, told its clients. It based this on an equation that predicts growth from the four coincident components.
The index of lagging indicators, which tends to move only after the economy as a whole, rose two-tenths of 1 percent, the Conference Board also calculated.
The ratio of the coincident index to the lagging one, a combination regarded as predictive, edged up slightly in June, continuing a recent pattern that has been fairly level.
The index of leading indicators, which had risen three-tenths of 1 percent in May, has itself held in a narrow range for more than a year, Cheryl R. Katz of Merrill Lynch noted. "We continue to look for United States economic growth to remain at a healthy 2.5-3 percent rate for the second half," she said.

HEADLINE: Even Nature Can Be Turned Into a Security;
High Yield and Big Risk With Catastrophe Bonds

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER 

 BODY:
Steven Goldstein has $3 million riding on whether a killer hurricane thrashes the Atlantic Seaboard this year.
If the gods of weather are kind, and damage is not widespread, Mr. Goldstein's investment venture will pocket a little more than $350,000. But if a storm hits with great force, his New Jersey firm has a whopping downside: It could lose the entire $3 million. 
 Mr. Goldstein just took the plunge into one of the most nerve-jangling securities ever designed, with a name to match: catastrophe bonds. They pay three or four percentage points more than comparably rated corporate bonds in a world where deals often hinge on a fraction of a percentage point. But unlike the situation with most other bonds, their entire principal can be forfeited to pay insurance claims if a big hurricane or earthquake hits.
When Wall Street investment bankers dreamed up these beauties, even the most daring high rollers ran for cover. But the bankers found a way to quantify the risk in terms that bond buyers could understand. And now, as they say in Monte Carlo, the tables are open. The first deal clicked last December. Late last month, the Swiss Reinsurance Company, one of the world's largest companies in the business of selling insurance to other insurers, completed a $137 million bond sale linked to the potential for a California earthquake. And a few weeks earlier, the United Services Automobile Association, one of the leading home and auto insurers, sold $477 million of the bonds that Mr. Goldstein bought.
Here is the gamble that he and his fellow bondholders -- all big-time professional investors -- are taking: If a single East Coast hurricane wreaks enough havoc within one year of the issue date to cost the insurer at least $1.5 billion in damage claims, the investors say goodbye to their entire principal. If the loss is between $1 billion and $1.5 billion, they lose a portion of their principal. Clear skies, or any combination of smaller storms, and the investors walk away with their principal plus about 11.8 percent, depending on fluctuations in London bank lending rates.
(One saving grace of the bonds is that if the worst happens, investors are at least assured of collecting the promised interest. But that, of course, amounts to only a fraction of the principal. And both U.S.A.A. and Swiss Re also offered bonds that paid less interest but guaranteed investors they eventually would get back some or all of their principal, no matter what disasters struck.)
Wall Street is humming over the new securities. Nearly every big house has a team arranging deals. Goldman, Sachs alone has a dozen people working on them full time.
"This is a hot new market, and there's a good chance of it developing into a very substantial market," said Jeff Mulholland, a vice president at Goldman.
To some extent, the new bonds are structured like those backed by mortgages, auto loans and credit card debt, in which tens of millions of dollars worth of loans are put together, then chopped up and sold to investors. The market for such bonds has soared into the trillions of dollars. And while bankers do not expect the catastrophe bonds to reach that level, they do envision a market in the tens of billions.
But unlike mortgage-backed bonds and the like, catastrophe bonds have no assets behind them; that is one reason many traditional money managers are keeping their distance. Nor do these bonds spread the risk of an individual failure in the same way as mortgage-backed bonds, since each catastrophe bond rests on a particular gamble.
But other investors like the fact that the bonds are unaffected by the ups and downs of the economy and thus help balance a portfolio, while beefing up performance numbers. Indeed, while catastrophe bonds are only for sophisticated investors with lots of money in various financial instruments, Mr. Goldstein, who has been handicapping insurance risk for years as the executive of a reinsurance company, says they are a far cry from casino gambling.
Deciding to play or not, Mr. Goldstein said, is a matter of working out the mathematical probability of disaster -- which for these bonds is tantamount to default. The bankers selling these bonds say that you do not need to be a meteorologist to quantify the risk. They have hired Ph.D.'s to churn through decades of data on storms, quakes, geographic concentrations of insurance coverage, housing stock and building codes. In the U.S.A.A. deal, the answer from the computers was that the likelihood that U.S.A.A. would be hit with a hurricane costing the company more than $1 billion was less than once in 100 years.
Once the computers did their work, the rating agencies -- Fitch Investors Service, Standard & Poor's, Moody's Investors Service and Duff & Phelps Credit Rating Company -- reviewed the catastrophe bonds as they would any others.
Instead of focusing on whether a disaster might strike, the agencies took the "once in 100 years" calculation and converted that into their way of talking about the likelihood of default. By their reckoning, the riskiest bets in U.S.A.A.'s deal were equivalent to those offered by junk bonds, albeit highly rated ones. The bonds that provided some protection of principal were rated as safer investment grade. Still, because of the nature of the bonds and because they are new, the issuers had to pay several percentage points more than for comparably rated bonds.
The rating agencies, said Jon Barry, a director at Salomon Brothers, have helped make the whole enterprise look rational. "They've given everybody ground cover," he said.
Of course, the past is not necessarily prologue. Investors have only to review the disasters of recent years -- like Hurricane Andrew, which inflicted $15.5 billion in damages in southern Florida in 1992, or the earthquake in Los Angeles two years later that cost insurers $12.5 billion -- to realize that "once every 100 years" events can strike more frequently. Besides, the programs that calculate statistical probability are not perfect. "Computer modeling is an imprecise science," Mr. Goldstein said. "Therein lies the uncertainty."
Indeed, the new investments take some getting used to. "When you talk to investors they imagine going to the boss to tell her they've just invested in a hurricane hitting North Carolina," one investment banker said. "And, it's kind of binary. Either the hurricane doesn't hit and they look like a hero. Or it does hit and they get fired."
Investors in these deals, Mr. Mulholland said, have to think in terms of the long run. "You don't want to play this game just once," he said. "You want to do more transactions so you can spread your risk. If you get hit in the first year, you give yourself the chance to recoup in the following years."
Mr. Goldstein and his colleagues at the PXRE Reinsurance Company in Edison, N.J., feel catastrophe bonds may be the wave of the future for the reinsurance business. And with that in mind, they formed a joint venture, Cat Bond Investors, allying PXRE with the Phoenix Home Life Mutual Insurance Company in Hartford. The hurricane bonds were the venture's first investment.
All the deals so far have been private placements limited to professionals with portfolios in the hundreds of millions or billions of dollars. These players are big enough to absorb a $5 million or $10 million loss on catastrophe bonds and go in for another round. The bonds are not available to small individual investors, though bankers say some mutual funds -- which they would not identify -- have bought the bonds in small quantities. Investors for years have been able to take direct risk on insurance through Lloyd's of London. But the Lloyd's investors put their entire net worth at risk, while catastrophe bondholders have a finite liability.
Anthony Chiarenza, the chief executive of Hedge Financial Products, a subsidiary of the CNA Financial Corporation, one of the largest commercial insurers, said the appeal of catastrophe bonds had been heightened by a decline in junk bond yields and by increasing concerns that the stock market was overheated.
For insurers, the bonds are a response to the terrible pain they suffered in the early 1990's from Hurricane Andrew and the Northridge, Calif., quake. Not only did the one-two punch double the cost of reinsurance, it also made insurance companies realize that the reinsurers' pockets might not be deep enough to cover a truly cataclysmic event. For all the wreckage Hurricane Andrew wrought, with losses several times that of any previous storm, it only brushed Miami. A direct hit on the city could easily put the insurance industry in hock for $50 billion, the experts say. Reinsurers would be able to cover only $17 billion of that, estimates Sean Mooney, an economist at the Insurance Information Institute, a trade group in New York.
By turning to the capital markets, the insurance companies are not only tapping into an almost bottomless source of financing, but are also creating a counterweight to future price increases by the reinsurers.
Most investors in both the hurricane and earthquake deals are betting against damage levels that are set at several billion dollars greater than anything seen so far. For example, bankers estimate that it would take a storm with total damages in the neighborhood of $20 billion to cost U.S.A.A. $1.5 billion. "We felt the odds of the event happening, the hurricane, were significantly less than the amount they were paying," Mr. Goldstein said.
Demand was greater than expected for both deals. The $477 million U.S.A.A. issue was oversubscribed by more than $500 million, while Swiss Re decided to increase its offering by $22 million more than the $115 million initially planned.
As more offerings become available, bankers say, more investors will come in, and the investors in early deals can diversify their risk within the new class of investment.
"If you're investing in emerging-country debt, you want to invest in 8 or 10 countries," Mr. Barry of Salomon Brothers said. "If one defaults, your portfolio still does well. Some people are saying they don't want to invest in catastrophe bonds until there are a lot more out there."
To be sure, many seasoned professionals continue to look askance at the bonds. Albert Gutierrez, a senior vice president at Conseco Capital Management, the money management unit of the big Conseco Inc. insurance company, says his company is staying on the sidelines for now because not enough offerings exist to spread out the risk. Plus, he says, the company wants to see how the bonds actually do before it jumps in.
"The capital markets are littered," Mr. Gutierrez said, "with high-yielding securities that history has proved were not yielding enough to compensate for the risk."

HEADLINE: President and Allies Hail 'Milestone'

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 5

 BODY:
With Speaker Newt Gingrich by his side, President Clinton today signed two bills he called a "true milestone for our nation" that put into place a plan to balance the Federal budget and to cut taxes for the first time since the Reagan era.
The signing ceremony on the South Lawn of the White House marked a truce between the Republicans and Democrats after two and a half years of partisan struggle on fiscal issues that led to the acrimonious Government shutdowns and veto fights of 1995. American flags dotted the lawn. A Marine band on the White House balcony played "God Bless America." 
 No better symbol of the mood of bipartisanship existed than the sight of the onetime bitter adversaries -- Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gingrich -- walking out of the White House together to the ceremony, along with Vice President Al Gore and Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, Democrat of New Jersey.
Despite the day's festival of cooperation, Republicans and Democrats were already starting to chart new agendas that promise battles to come over issues they failed to address in this deal, like how to reshape Medicare and Social Security to accommodate the retirement of the baby boom generation. Democrats are looking toward spending more on programs like education while Republicans want to push further with deeper tax cuts.
But for a moment they celebrated the signing of the long-sought legislation to balance the Federal budget by 2002. Surrounded by Democrats and Republicans alike, Mr. Clinton hailed the end "of years in which the deficit drained our economy and dampened our spirit."
"I believe that together we have fulfilled the responsibility of our generation to take America into a new century," Mr. Clinton said, "where there is opportunity for all who are responsible to work for it, where we have a chance to come together across all of our differences as a great American community."
Positively Reaganesque in his imagery, Mr. Clinton added, "We can say with pride and certainty that those who saw the sun setting on America were wrong. The sun is rising on America again."
Mr. Gingrich, the once-triumphant leader of the self-proclaimed Republican revolution who recently had to face down a Republican rebellion against him, thanked not just the President but the First Lady, Hillary Rodham Clinton, the Vice President and Tipper Gore for "their willingness this year coming off their victory to reach out a hand and say, 'Let's work together.' "
Mr. Gingrich called the pair of bills being signed proof "that the American constitutional system works, that slowly over time we listened to the will of the American people, that we reached beyond parties."
In a flight of rhetoric reminiscent of his headiness of old, he pledged to work with Democrats so that "we can make bipartisan progress at home and we can provide bipartisan leadership across the planet."
While Mr. Gore took his turn hailing the agreement, Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, who is expected to challenge the Vice President for the Democratic Presidential nomination in 2000, was notably absent. Mr. Gephardt opposed the balanced budget agreement as skewed to the nation's wealthy.
If the economy continues to perform as expected, the bills will eliminate the Federal deficit by 2002, and the Federal Government will have its first balanced budget since 1969.
The measures put in place more than $95 billion in net tax cuts over five years, including new tax credits for families with children, tax credits for higher education and reductions in the taxes on capital gains and estates.
More than $121 billion in savings are achieved over five years, mostly through limiting Medicare payments to doctors and hospitals. The measures also require that an additional $55 billion in savings be made through annual spending bills.
The bills include new spending as well, creating a $24 billion program to provide health care coverage for up to five million uninsured children. They would restore disability benefits for legal immigrants and some money for welfare programs that were eliminated last year in the new welfare law.
In some ways, the balanced budget agreement was as much a political milestone as a fiscal one, eliminating deficit reduction as the overarching issue preoccupying Washington and muting the sharp differences between the two parties that have existed on fiscal issues. It allows the great majority of Democrats who voted for it to say that they, too, support tax cuts, and gives Republicans the ability to say that they are in favor of education and health programs.
But already as they looked toward a 1998 election in which control of the House could be at stake, the two parties were looking for new agendas that they could play to partisan advantage.
Representative Vic Fazio, a California Democrat, said, for example, that he wanted to see Democrats make another try next year to win money for building new schools and to embrace a range of new issues on education, including the classroom performance of teachers.
"This just puts us in a new era where we have some new issues," Mr. Fazio said, "and the larger question of the balanced budget is no longer the centerpiece."
On the Republican side of the aisle, both Mr. Gingrich and Representative Bill Archer of Texas, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, have spoken of seeking further tax reductions and an overhaul of the tax code. Republicans are also assembling their own education agenda.
One looming issue for lawmakers is the impending retirement of the baby boom generation and the threat that the benefits those retirees would draw could renew large deficits and push the Medicare and Social Security programs into insolvency.
Fiscal experts noted that Congress -- because of partisan distrust between House Democrats and Republicans -- failed to enact several measures that had been supported by the Senate that might have made a dent in the problem by raising the retirement age, tying Medicare premium payments to income and introducing a $5 co-payment for home health care visits.
"We are looking at a Medicare problem and a Social Security problem which will get very serious after 2010, and we chose not to take some modest steps toward addressing those problems," said Robert D. Reischauer, an economist at the Brookings Institution.
Instead, the budget law establishes a 17-member bipartisan commission charged with reporting back on ways to keep the health insurance program for the elderly solvent. The report is due in 1999 -- a year after the midterm Congressional elections and a year before the Presidential race.
In the high spirits of the day, Mr. Gingrich pledged to work with Mr. Clinton not just to name a commission "but to enact in 1999 the right savings and the right steps to reform the system for the baby boomers and their children."
Even as Mr. Clinton was celebrating the bipartisan budget agreement today, his aides were debating whether the President should use newly acquired authority to sign a spending or tax measure and then strike out specific provisions within five days.
For the second straight day, the President's senior advisers huddled at the White House examining specific narrowly focused tax breaks that he could cut and debating the politics of doing so.
Officials said they were weighing how this line-item veto would affect the bipartisan mood and examining what kind of veto might make the best legal case, because the power is expected to be challenged in court.
Earlier this year the Supreme Court held that the Congressional opponents who challenged the line-item veto authority as unconstitutional had no standing to sue. But once the President uses the power, it is assumed that another case will be brought.
Mr. Gephardt, in a letter to the President, urged him to take a stand against a tax break given to the tobacco industry, which would allow it to write off a new cigarette tax increase included in the budget legislation against the companies' liability under the proposed national tobacco settlement.
"The American taxpayer deserves better than this special interest giveaway that sidesteps public accountability through back-room deals and under-the-table favors," Mr. Gephardt wrote.
Mr. Clinton's aides said the tobacco provision was not one he was able to veto under the provisions of the line-item veto law.

 BODY:

Ford Sales Increase More Than Expected
Ford Motor said that its United States sales rose more than expected in July, led by continued gains in its pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles.
The company's overall sales rose 5.1 percent; analysts had expected sales to rise 1 to 2 percent. Ford said domestic car sales fell 5.3 percent, while sales of pickup trucks, sport utility vehicles and mini-vans rose 14.9 percent. The report rounded out a fairly strong month for the American auto makers. General Motors sales also rose, though Chrysler's sales fell. [Page D4.]
 
Economic Index Is Unchanged
The index of leading economic indicators registered no increase in June despite the continued surge in stock prices, perhaps signaling that any rebound in growth in this year's second half would be modest. [D4.] 

Nynex Official Is Seen Leaving
Nynex is losing another top manager days before it is expected to win Federal approval of its merger with Bell Atlantic, executives at the companies said. Donald B.

Blockbuster Drags Down Viacom
Viacom said that it had swung to a loss in the second quarter, hurt largely by a $323 million charge at the company's Blockbuster video unit. On an operating basis, however, Viacom's loss was narrower than expected. [D9.]
 
Broadcast Executive To Join CNN
The Cable News Network, seeking to revive its ratings, named a broadcast news executive, Richard N. Kaplan, as its president. Mr. Kaplan, who won 34 Emmy Awards as a top producer at ABC News and CBS News, will take over CNN's flagship news network in the United States. Tom Johnson, who had held that job, will continue to oversee the CNN News Group, which includes CNN and other services. [D10.]
 
Nasdaq Rises, but Dow Falls
Technology stocks continued to roll, with semiconductor issues buoyed by anticipation of strong demand for new products; the Nasdaq composite index rose 16.08, to 1,621.53, a new high. But other stocks were mixed, and the Dow Jones industrial average declined 10.91, to 8,187.54. [D10.]
 
The prices of Treasury securities dropped for a third day as the market began to absorb a new supply of debt. The yield on the 30-year bond rose to 6.49 percent from 6.47. [D17.]
 
Thailand Agrees to I.M.F. Terms
The Thai Cabinet agreed to increase taxes and reorganize the nation's financial industry in return for a rescue package led by the I.M.F. that would pump as much as $15 billion into the battered economy. [D4.]
 
Russian Bank Wins Mining Stake
Oneksim Bank, one of Russia's most powerful banks, won 38 percent of Norilsk Nickel, one of the world's largest producers of nickel, copper and platinum, as a privatization auction went ahead despite the efforts of Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin to delay the sale. [A6.]
 
U.P.S. Nearly at a Halt
The strike at the United Parcel Service slowed the company's business to a near standstill, and for a second day there were no negotiations between management and the teamsters' union. [A17.]
 
Water, Water Everywhere
Seeking to enter the booming market for bottled water, officials of several American cities -- Houston, Kansas City and North Miami Beach -- that are far from the pristine mountain sites depicted in ads say they are exploring plans to sell water from their own municipal supplies. [A1.]
 
Clinton Signs Budget and Tax Bills
President Clinton, as expected, signed bills that put into place a plan to balance the Federal budget and to cut taxes for the first time since the Reagan era. [A14.]

HEADLINE: North Korea Joins Talks With South

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

 BODY:
Facing economic collapse, hunger and now drought, North Korea sat down for the first time yesterday with South Korea, the United States and China to discuss arranging peace talks to end the Korean War formally and to ease tensions on the peninsula.
The meeting was a preparatory session for four-party talks proposed by President Clinton and President Kim Young Sam of South Korea more than a year ago. It ended yesterday afternoon with no immediate agreements, although none had been expected.
North Korea's willingness to move ahead with the talks was seen by Administration officials in part as a sign of its desperation over its increasingly severe food shortages, which relief officials are now comparing to the famines in Ethiopia and Somalia. 
 On the eve of the talks, held in New York City in Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs, a senior Administration official said that North Korea's leaders had apparently decided the talks are "necessary to keep the international community engaged" in providing emergency food aid.
The session yesterday was the first of what are expected to be several days of meetings at Columbia involving delegations for each of the four countries. The point is to set a time, place and agenda for the quadripartite talks, which are expected to last for months.
The delegates had little to say after adjourning for the evening to attend a reception. But during a lunch recess, China's representative, Chen Jian, an Assistant Foreign Minister, offered a curt but positive assessment. "So far so good," said Mr. Chen, who was joining the talks for the first time.
Ji Won Suh, a spokesman for South Korea's delegation, said the four parties agreed to settle the least contentious issues first, including the time and place of the talks, while leaving the most contentious -- the agenda -- for the end.
North Korea has indicated that the presence of 37,000 American troops in South Korea should be included in any talks; the United States has argued that the agenda should deal with broader issues of cementing peace first.
Mr. Ji added that during the closed negotiations, North Korea's delegate, Kim Gye Gwan, the deputy minister for foreign affairs, had expressed hopes that the talks would "result in a fruitful conclusion."
Leading up to the meeting, the United States sought to play down expectations, even as American officials expressed hope that North Korea was serious in wanting to reduce tensions and to replace the armistice that ended the fighting in Korea with a more stable permanent treaty.
In what appeared to be a gesture of good will, North Korea on Monday handed over remains believed to belong to four American soldiers killed in 1950.
But with little hard information about North Korea's internal situation, the Clinton Administration remains wary. Officials said the severity of food shortages rather than a genuine interest in improved relations may be what has forced the North Koreans to the table.
Nevertheless, they hoped to use the talks as an occasion to propose modest gestures to improve relations, like establishing a hot line between the forces on either side of the demilitarized zone separating North and South Korea and providing advance notice of military maneuvers.
"I think that with respect to tension on the Korean peninsula, we are better off being engaged in this process and in this structure than we would be otherwise," a senior State Department official said. "So simply having commenced has some intangible benefit."
China's participation in the talks is likely to change the dynamic of the discussions, which until now had included only the United States and the two Koreas. China was North Korea's main ally during the war, but relations have soured in the three years since the death of the former North Korean leader, Kim Il Sung.
"I think the Chinese may be interested in rebuilding that relationship or improving on the present state of the relationship," the official said.

Israel's Harsh Stance Criticized
Arab and Western officials put pressure on Israel to ease the economic siege it has imposed on the Palestinian Authority after a suicide bombing in Jerusalem, and Arab leaders asserted that Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat was "not powerful enough" to carry out Israeli demands to root out terrorists. A statement by the military wing of the Islamic militant group Hamas warned of further attacks if Israel did not release Palestinian prisoners immediately. A3
 
North Korea Attends Talks
North Korea, reeling from impending famine and economic collapse, participated in a preliminary meeting in New York with South Korea, the United States and China to discuss arranging peace talks to formally end the Korean War and to ease tensions on the peninsula. The "four party" talks, originally proposed more than a year ago by President Clinton and the South Korean President, Kim Young Sam, will probably last for months. North Korea has said that any talks should include discussion of the 37,000 American troops on the peninsula. A10

'Soft Money' Giving Grows Despite Senate Hearings
Republican and Democrats alike have raised record amounts of donations in the first half of 1997, with fund-raisers saying that the financial scandals of the last election are apparently having little effect on the flow of money. A record $34 million in so-called soft money donations have been raised since January by both parties, according to a study released by Common Cause, a nonprofit group. G.O.P. committees received $23 million in such donations in that time, outdoing the Democrats by a two-to-one margin. A1

HEADLINE: Budget Offers Cornucopia of Tax Breaks For Everyone

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Aug. 5

 BODY:
Alongside large tax cuts with mass appeal, like reductions in property taxes and the sales tax on clothing, New York's new state budget is sprinkled with smaller cuts tailored for particular industries, some reflecting the lobbying of particular companies like International Business Machines and the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus.
Ringling and its lobbyists, the influential firm of Davidoff & Malito, won the elimination of the state sales tax on circus tickets, a cut that will cost the state a mere $100,000 a year. Because other major circuses, like the Big Apple Circus, are already exempt as "teaching circuses," only Ringling and perhaps one or two others that pass through the state each year were paying the tax, and only they will benefit from its elimination. 
 Another tax gives businesses up to 15 years to use tax credits they earn from making capital investments in the state, instead of 10 years. State officials said the company behind the measure -- and perhaps the only one that stands to benefit right away -- is I.B.M., which has not yet used all of the credits it earned for investments made in the 1980's, and stood to lose them under the 10-year rule. The extension is projected to cost the state about $5 million a year.
There are several smaller examples: wineries in New York State won elimination of the sales tax on wine tastings, at a cost to the state of $100,000 a year. Several industries that offer coin-operated amenities -- vending machines, photocopiers, car washes and airport luggage cart dispensers -- also won exemption from sales taxes, worth about $8 million a year.
"A lot of these were just nuisance taxes," said John McArdle, a spokesman for the Republican majority in the Senate. "The amounts for the state were small, but for the companies it was a lot of paperwork and a lot of hassle."
The budget also includes tax savings of $14 million a year for the insurance industry, $5 million a year for troubled banks, 1 cent on the sale of each canned or bottled drink, for a total of $26 million a year, $25 million a year for retailers, $3 million a year for unincorporated businesses that hire new workers, $9 million a year for family farmers and $1 million a year for people who put solar power units on their homes.
The Legislature and Gov. George E. Pataki agreed to cut 29 taxes in all, from those that dip into the bank accounts of millions of state residents and businesses to those that affect the fortunes of just one company or industry. The list reflects the state's fiscal bounty nearly three years into a Wall Street boom, and perhaps a dose of wishful thinking about the future, as well. The reductions are to be phased in over five years, costing the state just $117 million this fiscal year and ballooning to $4.8 billion, or about $260 per person, in 2001-02.
The Governor and Senate Republicans began the year by proposing ambitious tax cuts and declaring them the top priority. The conventional wisdom was that, as in years past, they would get less than they asked for, demanding the stars and settling for the moon; instead, they got the stars. Nearly every tax cut on the wish lists released last winter appears in the budget.
Not everyone is pleased. Independent fiscal monitors and a handful of legislators have worried aloud that the state is creating huge deficits for itself in future years because the growth of revenue from the personal income tax and other economically sensitive taxes could slow or drop dramatically. Senator Franz S. Leichter, a Manhattan Democrat, called the budget "fiscal suicide for the state."
When state lawmakers set about cutting taxes two years ago, they aimed at the state's largest source of revenue, the personal income tax, which also happens to be one of the broadest-based levies, paid by everyone from the working class to the wealthy. Most elements of this year's package are for more limited groups of beneficiaries, and many are for businesses rather than individuals.
The largest cut, by far, is a state program to reduce the property taxes localities charge to support local school systems, a program that benefits only homeowners, and that delivers the greatest savings to people in the wealthiest communities. The reduction, to be phased in over five years, will ultimately cost the state $2.24 billion a year.
The impact of the change will vary enormously from place to place, in part because property taxes differ widely. And the cut also gives a larger tax exemption on homes in counties where real estate is expensive, a feature that will almost exclusively benefit residents of the suburban counties around New York City.
In the city, the average savings for a homeowner will be $390 a year. In Westchester, it will be over $1,000.
To make up for the fact that most New York City residents, as renters, pay no direct property taxes, the state will pay to lower the city income tax by 10 percent by 2001, at a cost of $464 million a year.
The state will eliminate the gross receipts tax on hospitals, nursing homes and home care companies, which amounts to a sales tax on health care, at a cost of $530 million a year. It will also reduce by 30 percent the gross receipts tax on utilities, for another $440 million a year.
"The utility tax is probably the best tax cut in terms of fairness, because it's a heavier burden on low-income people and small businesses," said Frank J. Mauro, director of the Fiscal Policy Institute, a research group that studies state policies and is funded primarily by unions and foundations. "I would say the health care tax is the second-most-defensible tax cut, because it supports other important public policy goals, like keeping the hospitals viable and keeping down the cost of health care."
The state sales tax on clothing, up to $100 per article, will be eliminated in December 1999, at a cost of $445 million a year.
The budget will also greatly reduce the state's taxes on estates, at a cost of $400 million a year, in a way that will have little effect on low- and middle-income people, who rarely pay any estate taxes. Mr. Pataki has argued that the reduction was needed because elderly people were leaving New York to escape its high estate taxes.
Under the current system, when a person dies, there is no state tax on the first $115,000 of taxable assets left to heirs, on the first $250,000 in value of the person's primary residence, or on the first 5 percent of the value of a business the person owned. Above those limits, assets are taxed at a graduated scale, beginning at 2 percent and rising to 21 percent.
But effectively, the top marginal rate is actually 5 percent. That is because any state estate taxes paid, up to 16 percent of the value of the estate, can be counted as a credit against Federal estate taxes.
Starting next year, the new state law will raise the basic exemption from $115,000 to $300,000 and will lower the top rate from 21 percent to 16 percent, meaning that nearly the entire state tax bill can be credited against the Federal levy.
In 2000, the new state law will replace all three exemptions -- basic, home and small business -- with a single exemption set at the same level as the Federal exemption, or $700,000 in 2000. The Federal exemption is set to rise in steps to $1.3 million in 2006, but the state exemption will be capped at $1 million.

Hearing on Casino Donations

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN 

DATELINE: ATLANTIC CITY

 BODY:
State Senator William L. Gormley, a Democrat from Margate, faced a tough battle in the June primary against an opponent whose campaign contributors included lobbyists and others who do business with Donald J. Trump.
After winning the election, Mr. Gormley asked state regulators whether those donors broke a rule banning contributions to state and local candidates on behalf of casino owners or employees. 
 In response, the State Casino Control Commission proposed to clarify the rule and will hold a hearing on it today. Under the clarification, the term "on behalf of" would apply to anyone with "any economic, business, personal, familial or other relationship" to people with casino interests.

CORRECTION-DATE: August 7, 1997, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
A report in the Daily Briefing column in New Jersey copies yesterdayabout a proposed modification of state Casino Control Commission rules misstated the party affiliation of William L. Gormley, the State Senator whose complaint prompted the proposal. Mr. Gormley, of Margate, is a Republican, not a Democrat.

New Tax Law Takes Aim at Estee Lauder

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
In 1995, Wall Street was impressed by the successful initial public offering of the Estee Lauder Companies, a stock that leaped 25 percent in price when it began trading.
But many in Washington were more fascinated by the methods used by Estee Lauder and her son, Ronald, to avoid paying as much as $95 million in capital gains taxes on the profits they made when they sold stock in the company. 
 Now, in the new tax law signed by President Clinton yesterday, Washington has struck back at the Lauders. Unless one of them dies within the next few months -- or unless the law is amended or struck down by a court -- either the Lauders or their estates will end up facing a big tax bill.
That provision of the tax law could catch other families as well. The law has created a situation in which some families would face huge estate tax bills if a family member dies after a certain date, but not if he or she dies earlier. Other families may face the opposite: hefty taxes if a family member dies soon, but not if that person lives for a longer period of time.
In other words, taxes will be certain only if death comes at an inopportune time.
The relevant section of the tax bill concerns what are called "constructive sales" -- that is, transactions that have the same economic effect as selling stock but that previously escaped taxation.
Some such tactics are barred under the new bill. One is the long-term avoidance of taxes through a tactic called shorting against the box. That involves a person who owns a stock borrowing an equal number of shares of the same stock and selling them short. The seller no longer has any economic interest in the shares, since the profit or loss on the shares that are owned will be canceled out by the profit or loss on the short position. But the tax law until now has treated the two positions as separate. The new law deems the short sale to be a "constructive sale" of the stock.
One of the events that precipitated the new law was the Nov. 17, 1995, initial public offering of stock in the Estee Lauder Companies. Estee, the founder of the cosmetics company, and Ronald, a former ambassador to Austria and a one-time candidate for mayor of New York City, sold 13.8 million shares of the company to the public at $26 a share.
But rather than sell their own shares, the Lauders borrowed shares from other family members and sold them. They thus avoided paying as much as $95 million in capital gains taxes that might otherwise have been due. The Lauder case was extensively discussed when the Clinton Administration proposed legislation to prevent people from doing the same thing.
Under the law that then existed, those short positions could remain in effect until the death of each borrowing family member. Then the estate would automatically see the value of the shares raised to the then-current market value, and the share loan could be repaid. The effect would be to permanently avoid the capital gains tax.
The new law, aiming to catch the Lauders and anyone else who has done something similar, provides as follows: Anyone who opened such a position before June 8 of this year, held it open for at least two years, and had it open at any time within three years of their death, would lose the benefit of the increased value of the stock at death. The effect would be to force the estate to pay the capital gains tax.
There is one exception to that. If the short position is closed out within 30 days after the bill is signed -- that was yesterday -- the problem would be eliminated.
That exception would be of minimal use to the Lauders. The stock, having been issued at $26, closed yesterday at $47.31. Estee Lauder or Ronald Lauder could buy some stock at the current price, taking a sizeable tax loss, and repay that stock to reduce the short position. But that tax loss would be a real one as well, and seems to have little appeal to them.
A call seeking comment on the situation yesterday was not returned by a spokeswoman for the Estee Lauder Companies.
Because the stock was sold short less than two years ago, however, the new law would not apply to the estate of either Lauder if that person died within two years of the short sale -- by Nov. 17. The same would be true of the estate of any other person who did a similar transaction. Such transactions were common, although on a much smaller scale. Anyone who did such a transaction, and left it open, would be vulnerable unless they died within two years of doing the short sale.
At least, however, the tax would be smaller than it might have been. The tax would be based on paying capital gains taxes at the new 20 percent rate, rather than at the 28 percent rate that used to prevail.
The others who could be caught -- this time if they die too soon -- are those who had such a position open for at least two years and later closed it by covering the short sale. The law, rather bizarrely, exempts anyone who closes the short position in the 30 days beginning yesterday, but not anyone who closed it before or after that period. If a person who closed the position outside of the magic window were to die within three years of closing the position, his or her estate would face a hefty tax bill, noted Robert Willens, a tax expert at Salomon Brothers. But if that person died after the three years had passed, the tax bill would be much smaller.
Under the new law, constructive sales are now barred, because they will lead to taxation just as if the original position had been sold. But in doing that, Congress was relatively nice to Wall Street, and has left open a number of ways to come close to escaping risk without setting off taxes. The Congress accepted Wall Street arguments that a person should be able to temporarily hedge against losses without generating a tax.
The result is that if you do sell short against the box this year, you will not trigger the tax if the short position is closed by Jan. 30, 1998, and you then remain at risk of loss for at least 60 days. After that, you can put the short position back on, only to remove it again by the following Jan. 30.
In addition, the law seems to encourage the use of options, particularly an option technique known as a collar. In such a collar, a person who owns a stock sells a call option -- giving him the obligation to sell a stock at a certain price on or before a certain date -- and buys a put option, giving him the right but not the obligation to sell the stock at a certain price on or before a certain date. Depending on the relative strike prices of the two options, the result can be effectively the same as shorting against the box, or can leave the holder with some risk of loss or possibility of gain.
The new law says that while the Internal Revenue Service can issue regulations regarding collars, they will be effective only after they are issued, not retroactively. So any collar would now seem to be safe, at least until regulations are issued, particularly if some risk of loss or possibility of gain is preserved.
Robert Gordon, the president of Twenty-First Securities, a New York brokerage firm that often arranges tax-advantaged transactions, said the new law was likely to stimulate the use of options by investors who want to reduce risk while not having to pay taxes. He noted that in some cases, in which a collar effectively eliminated most possible losses, an investor could borrow from the brokerage house a large part of the value of the underlying stock.

HEADLINE: Evolution of an Oil Rush

BYLINE: By Daniel Yergin and Thane Gustafson; Daniel Yergin is president and Thane Gustafson is director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, an oil research and consulting firm. They are co-authors of "Russia 2010 and What It Means for the World."

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass.

 BODY:
The hottest spot in the oil industry? The Caspian Sea region, where Europe, Central Asia and the Middle East meet. The region's energy reserves are worth trillions of dollars; developing them will cost an estimated $50 billion or more over the next decade.
The stakes are huge. The Caspian Derby is a feverish amalgam of competition, collaboration and political and economic wrangling. The outcome will be critical to global economic growth in the next century -- and to the political consolidation of the independent states of the former Soviet Union, relations between Russia and the West and the role of Iran in the region's economy. 
 The Caspian may hold oil and gas reserves second only to those of the Middle East. Conservative estimates run as high as 100 billion barrels or more -- almost 10 times the reserves of Alaska. That amount could increase as exploration moves into deeper waters.
By as early as 2010 the Caspian could produce as much oil as the North Sea today, making it one of the world's main production centers. This will take pressure off the global market; by that time, the world could be consuming 30 percent more oil than it is today, with much of the increase in demand coming from Asia. The Caspian region also holds the potential of becoming a crucial supplier of the natural gas that Asia badly needs to meet its growing electric power requirements.
Azerbaijan, Kazakstan and Turkmenistan look like the big winners -- Azerbaijan and Kazakstan with the lion's share of oil, Kazakstan and Turkmenistan with well over half the gas. Russia and Iran appear to have only minor reserves in their corners of the Caspian.
Chevron is already shipping oil by rail from Kazakstan through Russia toward markets in Europe, and oil from Azerbaijan's new offshore fields is expected to reach the shores of the Black Sea, via a pipeline through Chechnya, for shipment to Europe later this year.
This treasure of the Caspian is a treasure rediscovered. In 1873, Robert Nobel, brother of Alfred Nobel, the inventor of dynamite and endower of the Nobel Prize, headed south from St. Petersburg to what is today Azerbaijan. He was looking for walnut trees, whose wood was used to make rifle stocks for the Czar's army. Instead, in Baku, on the shores of the Caspian, he found that local people had already established a primitive oil industry.
The Nobels built up the region's leading oil company; Robert Nobel's brother Ludwig became known as the Oil King of Baku. At the end of the 19th century, Baku was the world's number one source of oil. Until the middle of the 20th century it remained the largest European oil supplier, and capturing Baku was Hitler's top strategic objective when he invaded the Soviet Union in 1941. (The Nazis got close to it but ran out of fuel before they could capture it.) After World War II, output declined, and Soviet oil men turned their attention to the Urals and then to West Siberia for the resources that made the Soviet Union the world's largest oil producer, ahead of Saudi Arabia, by the 1980's.
As recently as the early 90's, many Western companies feared that investment in the Caspian region was too risky. The new independent countries of the former Soviet Union were shaky at best, and were ruled by ex-Communists. Russia might be back any day; there were numerous ethnic conflicts in the region, particularly between Azerbaijan and neighboring Armenia.
The region is hardly stable now, but the situation has improved enough to encourage investment. Russia is coming back but in a different way, as Russian companies promote their interests in the Caspian area. There are cease-fires in Chechnya and between Armenia and Azerbaijan. And though former Communists are still in power around the region, a number of them are, to one degree or another, embracing the free market and trying to attract Western investment.
Azerbaijan's President, Heydar Aliyev, got a warm welcome in Washington last week. Mr. Aliyev, the longtime Secretary of Azerbaijan's Communist Party who was a hard-line opponent of Mikhail S. Gorbachev in the Soviet Politburo, talked to American business leaders about his conversion to free markets.
Mr. Aliyev has played a skillful hand, using oil to strengthen his country's bargaining position against Russia by inviting two dozen foreign companies and governments -- Russian, American, British, French and Turkish, among others -- to develop the oil wealth off his country's shores. President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakstan, meanwhile, has welcomed Chinese as well as Western investment in Kazakstan's oil development.
Yet the risks to Caspian oil development remain considerable. The key is transportation -- that is, pipelines. At least half a dozen projects are under way or well along in the planning stages. Every single pipeline in the works must cross more than one country's border, and every one involves a delicate geopolitical balance.
For example, there is intense rivalry between Russia and Turkey over the route of the main pipeline that will carry Azerbaijani oil to world markets. If it cuts through Russia, to a Black Sea port for shipment by tankers through the Bosporus Strait, the Russians will increase their leverage in the Caspian region and Russian companies will profit. If the pipeline crosses Georgia and then cuts south across Turkey to the Mediterranean, it would be an economic boon to Turkey.
Yet the sources of instability that scared off oil companies in the early 1990's are still threats. The conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan, for example, remains unresolved; renewed fighting could jeopardize the Azerbaijani pipeline projects.
And if fighting breaks out again in Chechnya, just north of Azerbaijan, an important transportation route from the Caspian could be threatened. There is also inherent tension between Azerbaijan and Iran. About as many Azeris live in Iran as in Azerbaijan. Most Azerbaijanis are Shiite Muslims, but Mr. Aliyev has reaffirmed the country's commitment to secularism. That puts it directly at odds with Iran's Shiite fundamentalists.
Russia casts a large shadow on the region. Some fear it may try to reclaim control over the region. The legal status of the Caspian Sea is still unsettled, and some Russian politicians see the Caspian area as part of Russia's sphere. But the current Government in Moscow is showing more interest in getting the best business deals than in geopolitical hegemony.
In all this, the United States has sought to cast itself in what Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott recently called the role of the "honest broker," helping to solve regional conflicts and building institutions of a market economy, like tax codes.
The Caspian development is off to a much more promising start than might have been expected even two or three years ago. Multinational involvement in projects, including Russian and Turkish companies, will be critical to stability, especially on the main pipeline that will transport Azerbaijani oil. Already, Lukoil, the leading new Russian oil giant with close ties to the Russian political leadership, is an important player in the Caspian region, along with other Russian companies. Other Russian companies are expected to follow.
Indeed, if there is any lesson so far from the Caspian Derby, it is that the more players and the more oil and gas pipelines, the better. This makes it less likely that political interests will overplay their hands.

HEADLINE: Growing A Pie In the Sky

BYLINE: By ANNE RAVER 

 BODY:
JAY HERMAN made his fortune on Wall Street as a floor trader for the Commodity Exchange and then retired to his farm -- a garden in the sky in midtown Manhattan.
A man who used to divine the price of wool from minute to minute, he is refreshingly offhand about how he gets all his stuff to grow on his three terraces on the 12th and 13th floors of the apartment building where he lives, on East 49th Street near Second Avenue. 
 In this concrete and steel world grow figs, blueberries, blackberries, passion fruit, peaches, apples, currants, gooseberries, lemons, navel oranges and honeysuckle berries (and kiwis, if the vines would start producing).
"I can tell you all I know about figs in two seconds," Mr. Herman said on a recent hot summer day, standing in his little fig farm on the 13th floor. "Sun and no wind."
He doesn't wrap the fig trees, even though they stay out all winter on the two upper-floor terraces. "I guess this wall protects them," he said, referring to a waist-high brick wall that the potted figs are set against.
This whole garden, totaling about 1,250 square feet, begins with a 250-square-foot custom-built greenhouse on the 12th-floor terrace, which is a sunny extension of the living room, and then takes a leap to the north-and south-facing terraces off the spacious bedroom on the floor above.
"I leave the doors open at night," Mr. Herman said, "so it's like living in the country."
Installing the greenhouse, he said, was a nightmare. "Because of the various city ordinances and permits, I spent nearly as much for the plans and expediters to stand in line as the greenhouse cost." The greenhouse was $30,000 to construct; architectural and expediter fees were thousands more.
Needless to say, the greenhouse, which is shaded by upside-down parasols that he buys for $5 a pop in Chinatown, is where Mr. Herman, 68, spends much of his time in the winter. He eats his meals there at a little table, watching his orchids bloom, trying to will his banana plant to fruit (it won't) and hoping his rubber plant won't get any bigger (it does).
"Do you know anyone who needs a rubber plant?" he asked, as if anybody ever needed a rubber plant, outside the Amazon. "I started it from a cutting when I lived in the Village, about 30 years ago. And now look at it." The monster is summering on the lower terrace right now: it is 10 feet tall, if it's an inch; 6 feet around, and completely root-bound. It must weigh 150 pounds after a rain.
"You'd have to bring a truck," Mr. Herman said, hopefully. On the west side of the lower terrace, a philodendron seems to have forgotten that it lives in New York City and not in the jungle. And there's a herb garden, too, burgeoning in 21-inch plastic pots that are the color of terra cotta but a fraction as heavy.
"I found them on sale at the True Value," said Mr. Herman, who favors thrift and durability over style. (There is an old bicycle in the hallway that has pedal brakes and a basket; he rides it everywhere, without a helmet, because he likes the wind in his bushy gray hair.) He buys his herbs as small plants from the Union Square Greenmarket, and some, like the sage and the French tarragon, winter over right on the terrace. He has a basil that flowers each summer and scatters seeds to produce new plants in the spring.
His banana shrub is another story. It refuses to produce bananas, despite a sunny exposure on the east side of the lower terrace and warm winter quarters in the greenhouse. Even now, its paddle-shaped leaves, a beautiful burgundy with green swirls, are looking a bit ragged.
"It's too windy, no question," Mr. Herman said, adding that Michael McConkey, who owns Edible Landscaping, a mail-order company in Virginia that supplies him with many of his plants, suggested giving it phosphate to help it make fruit, because all it does is make big leaves. (Edible Landscaping is at P.O. Box 77, Afton, Va. 22920; 800-524-4156.)
"Anytime a leaf gets too scraggly, I cut the stem down to a bud, and it's mind-blowing to see it grow three inches in a couple of days," Mr. Herman said. "It's a New Yorker. It's overachieving to underachieve."
Most of the fruit production takes place one flight up, on the north and south terraces. And that includes the figs.
His tips on fig propagation are simple. "I take the cuttings in the spring, stick them in water and grow roots," he said.
Then, he just plants them in six-inch pots filled with Pro-Mix, his favorite potting mix, and makes sure they do not dry out. "I've made about 35 over the past few years," he said, "but I give most of them away."
About a half-dozen baby fig trees remain, huddling around the mother trees, which appear to be doing just fine in whisky barrels, dozens of figs swelling with promise from wide gray branches covered with sturdy, big, hand-shaped leaves.
"When they ripen in August, I can stand here and eat 10 of them at a time," Mr. Herman said.
How do they taste?
"Good," he said.
Well, what do they taste like?
"Figs."
There's a tradition of wrapping these Mediterranean plants in the fall, to protect them from freezing winters -- with burlap, old carpet, tar paper or plastic -- leaving an air hole at the top of the tree, with an old bucket over it. Mr. Herman doesn't bother with all that. He just grows hardy figs, purchased from Edible Landscaping.
His favorite is a fig called Hardy Chicago, which hails from the Windy City and can survive winters as cold as 10 degrees below zero. Another, called Long Island, survived the freeze of 1994. Verte is another reliable hardy fig, though it is late to ripen, unless you know a trick from the old country.
"Smear a little olive oil on the bottom of each fig," Mr. Herman said, holding up a fig as hard as a doorknob. The sun heats the oil, which heats the fig, and -- voila -- you have ripe figs before frost. Verte figs never turn from green to brown, as most figs do. So, birds looking for ripe brown figs, fly on by.
Then, there are the thornless blackberries, which are unbelievably big and sweet, and the sour cherry tree, which is laden with fruit begging for a mouthwatering pie (though Mr. Herman likes just to stand there and graze). The blueberries have been prolific this year, though their leaves looked a little brown, and Mr. Herman made a note to ask Mr. McConkey for advice.
Everything in this garden is on an automatic drip-irrigation system, which he purchased from Dripworks, a mail-order company in California. (Dripworks is at 380 Maple Street, Willits, Calif. 95490; 800-522-3747.)
"Once you get it going, it's a miracle," he said.
Except when a little black tube pops out of a pot and sends a little water fountain down to his neighbor's terrace below.
Drip-irrigation failures are only one problem in a terrace garden. It is important to check the weight-bearing capacity of the roof, of course. And it's wise to consult with an engineer before putting too many pots up there that might come crashing through the terrace onto your neighbors someday.
"But so much depends on what kind of soil you use," Mr. Herman said. "And how big the pots are. And where you put them." He shook his head wearily. "It all boils down to good will between you and your landlord, or the co-op board."
But there's nothing like having lemonade from the Meyer lemon tree, which produces dozens of big juicy lemons all winter. "Though that's a new one," Mr. Herman said, nodding at the little tree on his south terrace. "My old one died when I went away one winter and left the heat on in the greenhouse, and it dropped all its leaves."
He also has a Washington navel orange tree, but it produces only four or five oranges a year, with thick skins and no flavor. His white Patio peach tree bore delicious peaches this year. And the Bonfire peach, which has burgundy leaves and usually does well, this year, for some reason, dropped its fruit before they were the size of gumdrops. He also has an apple tree called Eddie April, but the fruit is green and sour, with a tough skin.
He has a medlar, too, which harks back to medieval England, but its fruit, which ripens in October, is mushy, with a big pit.
He's passionate about passion fruit, though. "It's spectacular," he said. "Slurpy, very sensual, semitart, delicious."
It's not surprising that Mr. Herman has a green thumb, as offhand as he may be about it. He got a degree in agriculture economics at Cornell University in 1949, when state schools -- including Cornell's College of Agriculture -- were nearly tuition-free.
"My idea was to have a farm -- even though I was born in the Bronx," he said. "But I didn't buy the farm, because I didn't have any money."
His parents were immigrants from Austria and Russia. "My father was an artist, and I don't think he ever made more than $100 a week," said Mr. Herman, who has a 39-year-old son, Michael, from a former marriage. "My mother supported us as a secretary and bookkeeper."
Mr. Herman spent his teen-age summers working on farms in upstate New York and Vermont, but he didn't learn much. "They always gave the tractor job to the other kid," he said. "I shoveled out the stables and slept in the woodshed. Being from New York City and a Jew -- they had never seen a Jew before -- I was a real outsider."
He went to Cornell just after World War II, and there was a shortage of student housing. He didn't have money for a room, anyway. So, he and an older student (an ex-prisoner of war who was sleeping in a station wagon), struck a deal with the campus poultry farm: they could live rent free in a 10-by-12-foot chicken coop, with two bunk beds and a potbellied stove, as long as they kept the foxes out of the other chicken coops.
After school, he had a string of jobs (including running a Perry Como contest, but don't ask), and eventually he met someone who knew someone at Merrill Lynch & Company who was looking for a commodity specialist -- in wool.
"All I did was wool," he said. "I have no interest in wool, but I was the expert. I figured out that there was a seasonal pattern between the price of wool in New York and the Continent and Australia. In the spring, when they clipped the sheep here, the price would be depressed, but not in Britain or Antwerp -- because they imported wool from Australia. I said, 'Come springtime, you should buy in New York -- and sell in London and Antwerp.' "
And the rest is history. Mr. Herman didn't buy the farm, but he bought the fields in the sky.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Is Up Again vs. Mark, But It Slips Against the Yen

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar reached another eight-year high against the mark yesterday, driven by a report showing rising German unemployment, but slipped against the yen on worries about trade friction with Japan.
Germany's jobless rate climbed to 11.4 percent in July from 11 percent in June. The rise was well above forecasts and weakened suspicion that the central bank might raise interest rates to help stabilize the faltering mark by improving returns on mark-denominated investments. 
 The news helped push the dollar to an intraday high of 1.8900 marks, the strongest since October 1989, before it settled in New York at 1.8815, up from 1.8792 Tuesday. It has gained 2.3 percent against the mark since July 31 and 22 percent this year.
Against the yen, the dollar reached an intraday high of 119.58 yesterday before retreating to settle in New York at 118.68, down from 119.25 on Tuesday. The British pound fell to its lowest level against the dollar since March 20, partly on reduced expectations of rising British interest rates. In New York, sterling settled at $1.6021, down from $1.6242.
The yen rose against the dollar after the Japanese reported that their broadest measure of trade for the first 20 days of July more than doubled from a year earlier. The data prompted the United States trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky, to warn that Japan should not try to export its way out of prolonged economic weakness.
Stephen Jury, managing director of foreign exchange at the Union Bank of Switzerland, noted that "any kind of trade friction generally causes the yen to strengthen." A higher yen would would help make American goods less expensive in Japan, possibly helping to narrow the trade imbalance a bit.
The dollar's advance against the mark was helped by comments from Friedrich Merz, a key political ally of Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who said that the planned European single currency, the euro, should be introduced as scheduled on Jan. 1, 1999.
Mr. Merz also said that the criteria for participation in the currency union should not be interpreted as strictly as other German officials had insisted. That reinforced a growing view in the market that the euro would be a weak successor to the mark, Europe's dominant currency.

HEADLINE: In America;
A Workers' Rebellion

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
It is more a rebellion than a strike. The walkout by 185,000 drivers, loaders and sorters of the United Parcel Service is best seen as the angry, fist-waving response of the frustrated American worker, a revolt against the ruthless treatment of workers by so many powerful corporations.
The Times's Dirk Johnson quoted a U.P.S. employee, Laura Pisciotti, on the picket line in Willow Springs, Ill.: "These companies all have the formula. They don't take you on full time. They don't pay benefits. Then their profits go through the roof." 
 U.P.S. has mastered the formula. It dominates the package delivery industry, earning $1 billion in profits last year. But for hourly employees, the men and women whose muscle and sweat and brains are needed to get the packages from one place to another, United Parcel is a grim and often dangerous place to work.
U.P.S. treats its employees like beasts of burden. Workers have to handle packages that weigh as much as 150 pounds while hurrying to meet the industry's relentless deadlines. Sorters sometimes handle 1,600 packages per hour. Injuries, many of them serious, come in waves. The company has seemed unconcerned.
Since 1990, according to the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration, U.P.S. has paid more than $4.4 million in penalties and settlement agreements for health and safety complaints. OSHA officials documented more than 1,300 violations during that period, said Bonnie Friedman, a spokeswoman.
Kate Bronfenbrenner, director of labor education research at Cornell University's School of Industrial and Labor Relations, said: "U.P.S. has one of the worst health and safety records. The company has an injury rate that is two and a half times the industry standard."
The reward for workers who put up with such conditions is the continuing contempt of top management. For the most part, U.P.S. doesn't even bother to offer full-time employment. Part-timers account for nearly 60 percent of the company's work force, and more than 80 percent of all the new hires over the past four years.
The pay for part-timers is lousy, less than half the hourly wage of full-time workers. And the jobs tend not to last long. U.P.S. hired 180,000 part-timers in 1996, and only 40,000 are still with the company. The shorter the stay, the less likely the worker will qualify for benefits.
"The situation at U.P.S. represents the dark side of job creation," Ms. Bronfenbrenner said. "Jobs where you work fewer than 20 hours a week, that have completely irregular hours and that disappear after three months -- are those the kinds of jobs we mean when we talk about job creation?"
That's the reality for many U.P.S. workers, which would be bad enough. But the company has managed to have it both ways. It also assigns thousands of part-time workers to full-time duty while refusing to give them full-time pay. More than 10,000 part-timers are working 35 or more hours a week, and they continue to be paid as part-timers. In the corporate suites, that is called smart management. In other places, it is called ripping people off.
U.P.S. workers, represented by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, finally decided they had put up with enough of management's contempt. On Monday they walked out.
At the very least the strike has thrown a brighter spotlight on the increasingly inequitable way that workers across the country have been treated over the past 25 years. The top corporations have thrived and the managerial elite has treated itself to breathtaking riches while enormous numbers of ordinary workers have seen their wages stagnate or decline, their health insurance and pension benefits vanish, their full-time jobs decay into temporary or part-time employment. The old ideal of job security has given way to permanent employment anxiety.
Jared Bernstein, an economist with the Economic Policy Institute in Washington, noted that all of this has occurred even as productivity has been increasing. "The economic pie has been growing at 1 percent a year for 25 years," he said, "which means that there is more compensation to go around. But that compensation has been distributed unequally."
The U.P.S. strike is a demand for a somewhat fairer distribution.

HEADLINE: Stable Prices and Low Wage Pressures Seen

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 6

 BODY:
The economy is continuing to expand moderately with subdued wage pressures and stable prices over all, the Federal Reserve said today in its latest regional economic survey.
"Economic activity generally expanded at a moderate rate in many districts in June and July, although several reported that growth was more brisk," the Fed said in its report, known as the beige book. 
 At the same time, "wage pressures remain generally subdued," the report said. "Overall prices were stable" for most goods except for some lumber and agricultural products, and companies in many areas "attributed their inability to raise prices to competitive pressures," the Fed said.
This lack of pricing power could signal that a cost squeeze may be developing for some companies. Seven of the Fed's 12 district banks reported "tight labor markets and shortages of skilled workers." Banks in Chicago and San Francisco indicated that labor shortages had curbed production in those districts, and five districts reported that it was increasingly difficult to find and train employees for entry-level and retail positions.
Manufacturing remained "at a high level or expanded," and consumer spending picked up, the Fed report said. Even so, automobile sales were "slightly softer" and home sales and construction, which increased "modestly" in recent weeks, still lag behind last year's pace, the report said.
The Fed also reported that factory inventories "remained at generally desirable levels," that commercial real estate activity strengthened and that housing construction and sales increased but lagged behind last year's levels.
Commercial lending rose while consumer lending was mixed, the Fed said. For farmers, rain "brought relief to crops damaged by heat and sparse rainfall."
The Fed's regional outlook is based on reports from the district banks. It is prepared eight times a year for use as a background briefing paper by the Federal Open Market Committee. The committee, which makes policy, next meets on Aug. 19 and is expected to leave interest rates unchanged.
The data in the latest beige book were collected before July 28. Since then, the auto industry has reported July statistics that suggested vehicle sales were accelerating.
The previous regional outlook, released June 18, reported economic growth was slowing as "pockets of weakness" developed in manufacturing, construction and retail sales during May and early June. Prices showed few signs of accelerating outside of energy and real estate.
 
Chart/Map: "Moderate Growth With Scattered Wage and Price Increases"
A roundup of regional economic conditions in recent months for the Federal Reserve's 12 districts, according to the beige book report issued by the Fed yesterday.
 
Minneapolis -- Employment and overall economic activity continued to grow amid wage pressures. Prices remained steady.
 
Chicago -- No new reports of upward price pressures as economy expanded moderately. Consumer spending picked up.
 
Cleveland -- Business activity expanded amid extremely low levels of joblessness and modest wage and price increases.
 
Boston -- Retailers and manufacturers reported little changes in prices. Employment was steady or up slightly.
 
New York -- Economy was expanding at a somewhat faster rate, led by a rebound in consumer spending.
 
Philadelphia -- Manufacturers reported gains in shipments and orders. Tourism was up and could set records.
 
Richmond -- Services and retail trade grew stronger. Manufacturing continued to expand at a healthy pace.
 
Atlanta -- Growth remained moderate across the district. Manufacturing was mixed and retail increased modestly.
 
St. Louis -- Growth in sales and employment helped the economy expand at a moderate pace. Tight labor markets persisted.
 
Kansas City -- Strong manufacturing activity offset declining retail sales. Labor markets remained tight with some wage increases.
 
Dallas -- Manufacturing increased and retailers reported varied sales growth. Agricultural conditions were reported to be favorable.
 
San Francisco -- Economic conditions were robust, though retail sales were moderate over all. Manufacturing activity was high, with signs of tightening capacity constraints in some industries.

HEADLINE: COMPUTING'S NEW ALLIANCE: THE FAITHFUL;
True Believers Seem Resigned To Alliance

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF 

DATELINE: BOSTON, Aug. 6

 BODY:
This year's Boston Macworld Exhibition is running true to form: a cacophonous mix of sideshow hucksterism, computer geek convocation and religious revival.
Apple Computer Inc., the quirky Cupertino, Calif., computer maker, has always had a huge camp following of devout Macintosh users whose commitment to their machine has been akin to religious zeal. Among the faithful, the pantheon of heroes has long included Stephen Wozniak and Steven P. Jobs, the fathers of the company's Apple II and Macintosh technologies. The villain has been the Microsoft Corporation's chairman, William H. Gates, whose Windows operating system juggernaut has left ever less room for alternatives in the computer industry. 
 But the faithful have been buffeted by the corporate and consumer decisions that have turned the company from a player to a minor player, and their religion seems to be giving way to a new sense of pragmatism. This year, in the sprawling World Trade Center here, there was a widespread conviction that the alliance with Microsoft, announced today, was a necessary evil, a key to helping Apple revitalize itself.
"My first reaction was, 'Oh my God, it's Microsoft!' " said Mary Reagan, a veteran Macintosh user who is a program manager for a Columbia University research project in Palisades, N.Y. "But then I decided that it was probably the right thing to do."
Her sentiments were echoed by many of the show-goers who strolled the floors listening to lively pitches being made by clone makers such as the Motorola Corporation, Umax Data Systems Inc. and the Power Computing Corporation.
"My angle is that this is a good, the whole O.S. war has been a bad thing," said Ian Blanton, the Internet services administrator for the Air Force Research Laboratory at Hanscom Air Force Base in Massachusetts, using computerese for "operating system" -- the product at the heart of the Microsoft-Apple rivalry.
Macintosh software companies also seemed to be pleased with any new Apple strategy that promised to inspire confidence in buyers. These buyers have deserted the Macintosh in droves in recent years, as distinctions between the Macintosh and Windows operating systems have become less discernible.
"The vendors are very happy by the clear focus," said Patrick McGovern, the chairman of the International Data Group, the parent company for the exhibition sponsor. "This is a survivable strategy."
At the Microsoft booth on the show floor here, it seemed like business as usual. The company has always been the largest independent Macintosh software publisher, with hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue annually from its Macintosh software.
One Microsoft employee said that nothing seemed to have changed this year. "It feels pretty much the same to me," Paul Seymour, who was showing off the Redmond, Wash. software giant's Macintosh programs, said. "I haven't noticed that it's any warmer or cooler than in the past."
Still, on a sunny day on a sidewalk in front of the World Trade Center, there was at least one piece of evidence that antipathy to Microsoft was going to die hard.
Frank Imburgia, a Macintosh user who for the last seven years has sold brightly colored T-shirts at the shows, proudly displayed one whose two-word legend was an emphatic expression of disdain for Microsoft.
"This is the first year that this one has sold out," he laughed.

HEADLINE: CLINTON ON THE ISSUES: THE DEFICIT;
Budget Deal, for Now, Takes Back Seat to the Economy

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 6

 BODY:
In announcing his estimate that the Federal budget deficit this year would fall to $37 billion, its lowest level since 1974, President Clinton acknowledged today that the strong economy and resulting unexpectedly high tax receipts had restored the Government's fiscal health even before the balanced-budget agreement he signed into law this week has had a chance to take effect.
But Administration officials and many private economists said the budget deal would be vital to keeping the deficit under control in coming years, when the gap between revenue and spending would otherwise begin widening again. And they said the deficit's steep decline over the last several years was due at least in part to previous deficit-reduction efforts, including tax increases to which President George Bush acceded in 1990 and another set pushed through by Mr. Clinton in 1993. 
 Based on an analysis of the Treasury Department's tax collections through June, economists had been predicting for the last month that the deficit for the current fiscal year, which ends on Sept. 30, would fall even further than previously expected, to around $40 billion, from last year's level of $107 billion.
White House officials had not disputed those projections but had avoided confirming them until now for fear that they would lead to an erosion of support for the budget deal among Republicans eager for bigger tax cuts and Democrats pressing for more spending.
The Congressional Budget Office issued a slightly more optimistic estimate than the Administration's today, saying the deficit should come in at about $34 billion.
Even at $37 billion, this year's deficit would be the smallest in dollar terms in 23 years and would also amount to only four-tenths of 1 percent of the nation's gross domestic product. That level is so low that it would have almost no effect on the economy and leave the United States in far better condition than other big nations, most of which are struggling to bring their deficits below 3 percent of G.D.P.
Some analysts continued to argue today that the budget deal would actually slow the nation's progress in eliminating the deficit completely because it provides for a five-year net tax cut of $95 billion and increases in a number of spending categories even as it reduces the rate of growth in Medicare and promises to cut discretionary spending in later years.
"It's a setback, not a move forward," said Stephen Moore, an economist at the Cato Institute.
Mr. Moore said the deficit would be lower next year than under the budget agreement if increases in spending for existing programs were limited to the rate of inflation and all other policies were left unchanged.
Administration officials and Republicans who were involved in the budget deal said it was true that the deficit was likely to rise next year, both from this year's level and from the so-called baseline: the level it would find without any changes in current tax or spending policies.
In the following years, however, the savings from the budget deal will accumulate rapidly, they said. Administration officials said they expected net savings of about $190 billion in the next five years.
Without the budget agreement, "our budget officials estimate the deficit would rise next year -- to fifty to a hundred billion dollars -- and stay at that level for years to come," Mr. Clinton said at his news conference today. "With our bipartisan balanced-budget plan, we now expect it not only to reach balance by 2002 but to have a surplus in excess of $20 billion and to be able to maintain that for several years thereafter."
Some analysts remained skeptical, saying that Congress would not summon the will to cut spending as planned in future years and that the budget plan's assumptions about revenue from sources like auctions of the broadcast spectrum were far too optimistic.
Even some analysts who supported the budget deal as the best one possible, given the political realities, said it would prove valuable only if it served as a basis for addressing the long-term problems of Medicare and Social Security, which threaten a huge surge in the deficit in coming decades as baby boomers retire.

HEADLINE: Teamsters and U.P.S. Agree to Resume Talks

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
The International Brotherhood of Teamsters and the United Parcel Service have agreed to resume talks today in an effort to end the three-day-old walkout by 185,000 drivers, loaders and sorters, Federal mediators announced yesterday.
The two sides agreed to return to the bargaining table with John Calhoun Wells, the director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, after being urged to do so by the White House officials and Labor Secretary Alexis M. Herman. Administration officials said they feared that the strike, over pensions and the use of part-time workers, would soon bite into the nation's economic output. 
 Rand Wilson, a union spokesman, said: "The main thing here is that we've shown that U.P.S. can't move 12 million packages a day without us. We've shown that we have public support. We've shown that our members are united for good, full-time jobs. That's why they're coming to the table."
Even as the two sides prepared for talks, U.P.S. officials called on President Clinton to use his emergency powers under the Taft-Hartley Act to stop the walkout, saying that it was hurting the economy. But at a news conference, Mr. Clinton indicated yesterday that he had no plans to invoke those powers.
"There has to be a severe damage to the country," the President said, explaining that it was a "very high" standard that had not been met.
Gina Ellrich, a U.P.S. spokeswoman, said: "It's true severe damage has to be done before Taft-Hartley can be evoked. But we're well on the road to severe damage."
Voicing concerns about such damage, the United States Chamber of Commerce and other leading business groups called on Mr. Clinton yesterday to pressure the two sides to settle. A spokesman for the organization said it would also like the President to end the strike.
The organization and the National Retail Federation made written appeals to President Clinton as more companies said the strike had hurt their operations by making it difficult to ship all sorts of goods.
"We have received hundreds of calls from our members desperate for a quick end to the strike so they can continue with their operations," wrote Richard Lesher, the chamber's president. "Unfortunately, alternatives to U.P.S. are few or simply unavailable at this time."
U.P.S. officials said that they were no longer accepting packages for ground shipment and that their business was less than 10 percent of normal. Most of the company's volume this week has consisted of packages sent overnight by air and international business, the officials said.
Ronald Carey, the teamsters' president, appeared at a rally at a United Parcel plant in Chicago with John J. Sweeney, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.
Mr. Sweeney said the A.F.L.-C.I.O. would do whatever it took to help the strikers.
"Working families all across this country," he added, "are being squeezed because companies are replacing good-paying, full-benefit, full-time jobs with low-paying, no-benefit, no-security, part-time jobs."

HEADLINE: CLINTON ON THE ISSUES;
Excerpts From Clinton's News Conference at the White House

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 6

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from President Clinton's news conference today on the South Lawn of the White House, from a transcript provided by the Federal News Service, a private transcription company:
 
OPENING REMARKS
Before I begin, let me first say that I join with all Americans in expressing our deepest condolences for the victims of the terrible plane crash yesterday in Guam. I have spoken with Governor Gutierrez, and I want to commend him, the hundreds of volunteers, and the United States military personnel who are working so hard on the response and the rescue effort. The National Transportation Safety Board will lead the investigation of the crash with technical assistance from the F.A.A. and other agencies as needed. 
 Now, today I want to briefly review what our nation has accomplished during the first seven months of this year, and to spell out the opportunities and the obligations that we have to continue that progress.
As I have said over and over again, our common mission must be to prepare our people for the 21st century, to master the challenges and seize the opportunities of this remarkable time. I believe the American people are coming to see that and coming to believe that as we pass through this period of remarkable change, the future holds far greater rewards than risks if our people, our government, and our other institutions are ready for tomorrow.
In these past months, we have seen how the politics of the vital center can work to make progress on many of our most difficult problems. We ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention, a landmark treaty that will protect our soldiers and our citizens from the threat of poison gas. We reached agreement in Madrid to open the doors of NATO to Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic, while creating a stronger partnership with Russia and Ukraine, to build a Europe that is undivided, democratic, and at peace.
These past months have been a remarkably fruitful time for bipartisan action in the national interests, and I think we have to continue that work.
I should mention, too, that we worked in a bipartisan fashion to maintain our normal trade relationships with China, reaching out to a quarter of the world's population while making our differences with the government over human rights and other matters clear.
These are major accomplishments, all achieved with the support of Americans, both Democrats and Republicans. They have strengthened our nation.
And yesterday, we took an historic action to eliminate the annual budget deficits we have been seeing, and piling up, since 1969. The first step toward that was taken back in 1993 when we abandoned supply-side trickle-down economics, opened a new chapter in fiscal responsibility with a new strategy of growth, based on reducing the deficit, investing in education and training, opening the world to trade and American products and services. Even before yesterday, the deficit had been reduced by over 75 percent as a result of this strategy.
But yesterday, when I signed into law the first balanced-budget act in a generation, we know that it will add to the long-term economic growth potential of the United States. We know, too, that it includes the largest increase in college aid since the G.I. Bill 50 years ago, the largest increase in children's health since Medicaid was enacted, first, over 30 years ago.
Today, I have some more good news. Our efforts have led to an even lower deficit than we had previously projected. In this, the fourth year of the five-year economic plan adopted in 1993, we now expect the deficit to drop to $37 billion. Yet, without the bipartisan balanced budget we just passed, our budget officials estimate the deficit would rise next year, to $50- to $100 billion, and stay at that level for years to come. With our bipartisan balanced budget plan, we now expect it not only to reach balance by 2002, but to have a surplus in excess of $20 billion, and to be able to maintain that for several years thereafter.
There are still big challenges and tough decisions that we have to make beyond the balanced budget, however, if we're going to keep our economy growing, and keep our people fully prepared for the new century.
To meet that, members of Congress from both sides of the aisle and Americans from all walks of life must summon the will and spirit that led to the balanced budget. We have a lot of work to do in the rest of this year.
First, if we expect to keep our economy strong and growing, we must continue to invest in the education and training of our people, and we must succeed in our push for high national standards and tests to make sure our students, our schools, and our teachers are doing the job.
Second, we must tackle the tough issue of entitlement reform. We have to make tough choices to strengthen and protect Medicare and Social Security over the long run. They are the two most important social service innovations of the 20th century. This is not simply a matter of fiscal responsibility; it is also a matter of honoring the duties we owe both to our parents and to the next generation. The balanced-budget bill I signed yesterday sets up a bipartisan commission to reform Medicare. This fall, along with the members of the Congress, I will appoint the members of the commission and they will get to work.
We'll also tackle other issues to strengthen our families, exploring ways to improve child care in America and continuing our efforts to reduce the use of tobacco among our children.
Third, we will grow our economy and create good jobs by continuing to open more foreign markets to our goods and services -- through tough, fair trade agreements. We must continue to reach out to the more than 95 percent of the world's consumers who live beyond our borders. That is why I will ask Congress to give me fast-track authority to negotiate new trade agreements that will extend free and fair trade to keep our economy going.
Fourth, it is obvious that we cannot fulfill our obligations to future generations unless we also deal responsibly with the environmental challenge of global climate change. Growing our economy need not -- indeed, it must not -- contradict our commitment to protecting the environment. When the nations of the world meet in Kyoto in December, we must all take concrete steps to address this problem. The United States must commit to realistic and binding limits on our emissions of greenhouse gases. The science demands that we act, and again, we owe it to our children.
Finally, let me say, as I did in the State of the Union address, that one of our most critical pieces of unfinished business remains campaign finance reform. When Congress returns from its vacation, Senators McCain and Feingold have made clear they will bring campaign finance reform legislation to the floor of the Senate. This will be the time of testing. The special interests and their allies have killed reform year after year. But this year, the eyes of America will be on the Senate floor.
I will give my strong support to McCain-Feingold, and if the American people will give their strong support, I am determined that we can prevail. It should not be as easy this year, as it has been in each of the four previous years, to kill campaign finance reform with a Senate filibuster by a minority of the Senate. This year it is very important that every American know where every single elected Federal official in Washington stands on this issue. Are you yes, or are you no? It should be clear and unambiguous, and I believe if it is, we have a chance to succeed in passing the bill.
All these challenges will require bipartisan cooperation. Many of them will require difficult decisions. But this balanced budget and the prosperity we are now enjoying gives us a rare opportunity to take these steps for the long-term well-being of our country.
We can meet the challenges of the 21st century. We can have higher educational standards, entitlement reform, campaign finance reform, expanding trade, and a cleaner environment. This budget agreement shows that we can do all these things when we work together to find common ground. We have to carry this spirit into the fall for the hard work ahead.
 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Q: The United States has avoided nurturing peace for a long time in the Middle East -- a tinderbox. . . . But yet, editorially, the Washington Post says your choices are -- and if you'll permit me to read it -- says, "Up to now, President Clinton has avoided confronting the implications of Mr. Netanyahu's reluctance to bargain territory for a Palestinian settlement. Now he must decide whether to minimize short-run frictions with the Israeli government or reach for a long-term peace."
What do you say to that?
A: Well, first of all, let me say that the Secretary of State gave a very important speech to the Press Club at noon today. I read the speech last night. I went over it with great care, and I am in full accord with what she said.
Secondly, in this year alone, the United States helped to broker the Hebron agreement. We have hosted all the leaders from the Middle East here. Dennis Ross has been to the Middle East twice. We have worked very hard on this. . . . The question is not whether the United States or this administration, on any given day or week, is popular or not in any foreign capital. The question is: Are we doing what is most likely to work? And sometimes reasonable people can disagree about that. . . .
I have asked Dennis Ross to go back to the region, to primarily discuss security. As Secretary Albright made clear, until the parties trust each other, and until the Israelis believe that the Palestinian Authority is making 100 percent effort, which is different from 100 percent results, but making 100 percent effort on security, it is impossible for peace to proceed. . . .
On the substance of the peace process, the parties still have to make the final decision. But on the process itself, how to get the process going again with some integrity designed to restore confidence in both parties, I think the United States can and should offer its best ideas. And that is exactly what we intend to do. . . .
Q: Well, the point of friction has been the settlement. And do you think you have been evenhanded in that respect?
A: Well, I think we've made it clear to the Israelis that we don't think anything should be done which undermines the trust of the parties and violates either the spirit or the letter of the Oslo Accord, and which predetermines the outcome of final settlement issues under Oslo. . . .
But let me say, there is no parallel between bombs and bulldozers. You cannot draw a parallel. We cannot have an environment in which people believe the way to get what they want is to kill innocent people in a marketplace.
Furthermore, I believe the people who are responsible for those terrorist bombs are the enemies of the Palestinian Authority as well. And I think they ought to see that. It is imperative that Mr. Arafat understand that those people are not his friends, either. Those people do not want a peace. Their closest allies in terms of political objectives may be their most extreme enemies in Israel who do not believe that peace is possible. The people that murdered all those people, those innocent civilians, are not trying to get a peace that they think is more favorable to the Palestinian and the Arab cause. They are trying to murder the peace process. And as soon as we all understand that and go back to work on it, then I think, you know, we have as chance to make progress. But I also believe that the government of Israel clearly has a responsibility to carry its end of the load, too. This has got to be a two-way street. . . .
Q: The tax cut and budget bills that you signed yesterday were criticized by your own Treasury secretary as "heavily laden with special interest provisions." You have the power to use the line-item veto to take out some of those special-interest tax breaks. Are you planning to exercise that power?
A: Well, the short answer is that I expect there will some exercise of that. But let me tell you what we're doing.
First of all, I have asked my staff and relevant Cabinet members to review both the budget bill and the tax bill. . . .
In the tax bill, there are certain limited -- and they're quite limited -- special tax provisions that are subject to the line-item veto. In the budget bill, there are certain special spending programs under the so-called entitlement umbrella that are subject to the line-item veto. I must act on either one of them within five days from yesterday, excluding Sunday. That's what the law says. In addition to that, as the annual appropriations are passed, they too -- the spending items within the annual appropriations -- are subject to the line-item veto.
So what I've asked my staff and Cabinet to do is to meet with me, first of all, make sure I am aware of the items that are subject to veto in the tax bill and in the budget bill that I signed. And then the second thing we have to do is to make absolutely sure that none of these things that we don't think are very good were part of the agreement. That is, this was an agreement entered into in good faith, and I cannot use the line-item veto on anything that our negotiators agreed to let go through. I think that's very important. . . . Then after that, we'll have a category of items, and I will just go down and evaluate them and decide whether I think that they are sufficiently objectionable that they should be vetoed.
Q: On this deficit reduction that you've just mentioned, that it's now fallen to $37 billion, doesn't it raise the question that in fact the budget could be balanced a lot sooner if you and Congress hadn't enacted $95 billion in tax cuts?
A: Well, let me say this, if we hadn't done anything, if we'd had no tax cuts and no other changes, our estimates are -- keep in mind these tax cuts are over a five-year period -- our estimates are that we would have a deficit which would rise over the next five years and stay at about the level of $100 billion. So you can also say that if we hadn't spent $24 billion on children's health care, we could balance the budget, if we abolished the spending on education we could do it. The question is, can we do this in a way that also helps the American people and gives them some of the benefit of the prosperity that has been generated in the last five years. . . .
There's a lot of discussion about this tax cut. I want to make two things clear. This tax cut is a small fraction of the size of the tax cut that was adopted in '81 that started us down the road to permanent structural deficits. . . .
No. 2, 80 percent of this tax cut goes to three things which will benefit the vast majority of Americans: education, the child tax credit, and the initiatives to help isolated and distressed urban and rural communities. . . .
Q: What makes you believe that future Congresses will continue along the path to keep the -- to balance the budget in 2002 or to keep it balanced?
And also, sir, in 1994 you referred to "extreme Republicans who want tax cuts and spending increases and balanced budgets -- all this ridiculous stuff." That seems to be what you got yesterday. I mean, you came here intending to stimulate the economy with government spending and to get universal health care. Why did you change your mind?
A: That's not accurate. I also said that we would cut the deficit in half in four years. We did better than I said; we cut it by 75 percent in four years. . . .
I also said that I would have to eliminate programs, cut the size of government by at least 100,000, and do more things that we had -- that -- I believed we could reduce the deficit and increase targeted investment. . . .
There are more entitlement savings in the Medicare program in this budget than ever in any budget since Medicare's been enacted -- about $400 billion. There are new, modest fees for home health care in the Medicare premium. So, there will be -- this is not all increased spending. Some things will be increased, many things will be decreased. And if we do it, we'll produce growth. . . .
I'm convinced that if we did not pass this plan, and did not say to the world and to the investor community "we're going to balance the budget," it would slow economic growth. . . .
Why do I think subsequent Congresses will stay with this? Because I think that they have seen what happens if you do this, if you have fiscal responsibility and you're running a balanced budget when you have good economic times, then you get rewarded in the markets, and your economy does well. If you spend a lot of money you shouldn't be spending, and you run big deficits in good economic times, the international financial markets will punish the United States. They will drive up interest rates, they will drive down the value of our stock market, they will weaken our economy, and they will make the deficits even worse.
Q: You said that the American people should know where every political figure in Washington stands on campaign finance. Yet, at the same time that you've called for an end to soft money, you continue to raise it for your party. . . .
A: We live in a competitive world. And notwithstanding what the image may be, constantly -- and you see again in the press today -- the Republicans raise more money, raise more big money, and raise more money from non-citizens than the Democrats do. But we have to raise enough to be competitive. . . .
But the lesson that we have learned is there is too much money in this system, but it's because of the cost of communication. It's the cost of communication that's driving this up. And so we have got to get free air time or reduced air time, and we've got to get campaign finance reform. . . .
Let me just say. Look at what we have done, just since the first of this year. We want the F.C.C. to deal with the issue of free air time. I have appointed an advisory committee to explore that. I have asked former Vice President Mondale and former Senator Nancy Kassebaum-Baker to head a national group to get citizens involved in campaign finance reform. I have asked the F.E.C. to reconsider the rules that it made, which made soft money possible in the first place. And I am supporting Kennedy-Kassebaum. I don't know what else I can do. . . .
Q: You spoke of entitlement reform, but the Medicare Commission will not return its recommendations until the spring of 1999. . . . First of all, in that context, one year before the presidential elections begin, do you really believe that there will be the political will to do something drastic vis-a-vis Medicare reform? And number two, on Social Security, you've had a chance to think about this for several years now. Can you tell us what your recommendations might be in terms of keeping Social Security from going bankrupt?
A: Well, first let me -- let me deal with the Medicare issue. . . . I think that, first of all, this commission may decide to make interim recommendations and we may take a series of steps. Secondly, if they make a package recommendation at the end, and it has the support of all these appointees -- and I can assure you, I'm going to work hard to appoint distinguished, good people to this commission that will inspire confidence in our citizens -- then I think that Congress will be prepared to act on it. And I feel the same way about Social Security. . . .
These systems would work for a longer period of time than they otherwise will but for the fact of the baby boom and the fact that all seniors are living longer. . . . When the baby boomers retire, because of the length of life of senior citizens, there will come a time when there will be almost only two people working, just a few more than two people working, a fraction over two, for every one person on these programs.
And you asked me do I think that we will take the steps necessary to reform them. I do. And I -- I feel that for a simple reason: No. 1 -- and I'm the oldest of the baby boomers -- I don't believe that our generation wants to ask our children to make drastic sacrifices to support us because we wouldn't take modest steps now that don't have to affect the people that are now retired at all. You know, if we can deal with this over a longer period of time that -- and in ways that don't affect people who are now retired at all, or at least in a very minimal fashion -- and I think it's an intergenerational obligation, and I expect it to be fulfilled.
Q: The stock market has been soaring in recent months. Are you worried or concerned about whether ordinary Americans understand the risk involved in their investments at this time?
A: Hmm. Anything I say is wrong, right? If I say yes, the market drops tomorrow. If I say no, someday it'll drop, and I'll be a heel. . . .
That increase has been accompanied by a very brisk growth in our economy and strong growth in productivity. . . .
You know, all markets go up and down at various times. But I think that if you go back over the last 30 years, investments in the stock market held over the long term have panned out pretty well. And there aren't too many people of modest incomes who put a huge amount of money in the stock market on one day and then have to take it out four months from now no matter what. And, you know, I think that these mutual funds, these retirement funds, they can mix their investments, and they can do it over a longer period of time. So I think that on the whole what they're doing is betting on the larger American economy. And I think that's a very good bet.
Q: In light of the new alliance between Apple and Microsoft that was announced today I wondered if you could tell us if you're troubled at all by the phenomenal growth of the Microsoft Corporation and if you or your administration is considering putting any limits on that growth if you -- and if not, how this is different from oil and steel and the railroads in the early parts of the century.
A: I can't comment on this particular announcement today because it just happened today and its economic effects under our laws have to be analyzed.
But, as you know, that Microsoft has been involved in the last -- since I've been president -- in various legal issues relating to its organization and operations. And I think, all I can tell you is we will treat them in the same way we would anyone else, and make the analysis of law that seems appropriate in the Justice Department. I have to wait to hear from them about whether there are any antitrust implications to this.
Q: Mr. President, in a civil suit filed against you, attorneys for the plaintiff have issued a subpoena for an individual who may or may not have worked in the White House. Your staff, when asked to clarify the status of that individual in the past, refuses to answer the question and refers it to an outside attorney. Even for those of us who don't have much appetite for this entire subject, this particular answer in this particular category, seems needlessly evasive. . . .
A: Well, first of all, I think the answer is probably known. But I think that Mr. Bennett and the person in question's lawyers gave the only relevant answers. And there was a request to be left alone and not harassed, and we're just trying to honor it. I don't really have anything to say -- to add to what Mr. Bennett already said about it.
Q: I want to ask a question about the U.P.S. strike. But before I do, I want to just clarify what you meant by the line-item veto, that you expect to exercise it. Do you mean between now and Monday you expect to exercise or it, or exercise it in the fall when there are appropriations bills?
A: I mean I expect to exercise it, and I know -- I am anticipating that there will be some things between now and Monday that I would want to exercise it on. But I want to emphasize this: I have not had a briefing on this, and I literally -- all I know about this is what I have read in the press, you know, about the list of tax items which are subject to the line-item veto. . . .
But I honestly don't know enough to tell you today: Here's something I'm going to veto. . . .
Q: If I could just ask on the U.P.S. strike -- there are lot of small businesses out there that are suffering right now as a result of this. And they see you standing by, encouraging both sides to go back to the bargaining table but not really doing anything about it. And some of your critics are saying that's because the labor unions supported you and the Democrats, so overwhelmingly, over these past few years.
Is that a fair criticism of why you're standing aside and not----
A: No.
Q: ----getting directly involved in this strike?
A: No. Let me urge you all to do one thing, because I think it would be very helpful to people, to the American people, generally, to know this.
If you compare what I did in the American Airlines strike, which is the only strike I have been involved in where -- you know, recently where I had some authority there -- the airline companies, because they take passengers, are governed by a Federal law, which gives the president the power to intervene if there is substantial economic danger or damage to the country.
The U.P.S. strike with the teamsters is not covered by that law. It is covered by the Taft-Hartley Act. If you look at the Taft-Hartley Act, there has to be a severe damage to the country. The test is very different and very high before the President can intervene. . . .
I'm very concerned about all the customers and users of U.P.S. and what's happening to them. But I do not believe that it is a fair reading of the Taft-Hartley law, which is the law I have to act under, that the high standard of that law has been met. . . .
Q: You also put into law yesterday, of course, with the tax and budget provisions, was the District of Columbia rescue plan and there's an extraordinary amount of roiling around and criticism in the city and I think around -- perhaps around the country about what's taken to be a trampling of home rule for this nation's capital city as democracy advances in the rest of the world, some folks are worried that it may be receding here and the fact that Mayor Barry's powers have been reduced to a certain extent as an un-elected control board comes in to make these management reforms and deal with the aid. And there are some that think that this may be an attack on Mr. Barry personally, that this is in the legislation. Are you concerned about this to the extent that you're going to try to do anything to follow up on it, talk to Ms. Norton. I wonder what reaction would be?
A: Well, first of all, we've already been in touch with Congresswoman Norton about this in some detail.
Let me back up and say that I think on balance the legislation was very good for the District of Columbia because it will have the affect of injecting about $200 million in cash into the city this year. As the state -- the federal government pays a higher share of the Medicare budget of D.C., it begins to take over the prisons, it begins to assume the pension liabilities, what I was hoping to do was to remove from the District of Columbia the burdens that normally are borne by a state but that this city has had to bear, and then to give the local officials more responsibility for the things that a city must do: run a good school system, keep the streets safe, repair the roads and the highways and the streets, and do the other things that the city has to do. And the Congress simultaneously wanted to strengthen the whole reform system that was represented by the control board. And it was a congressional initiative and, if you will, a condition of getting the financial relief that the provisions that you mentioned were adopted which, among other things, require a joint agreement of new department heads between the Mayor and the head of the control board. . . .
Frank Raines, as all of you know, is representing me in our D.C. negotiations. I've asked him to try to get together with the parties and see if we can find a way to make these appointments consistent with home rule, and that if he finds the situation to be untenable, to come back to me with some suggestions about what we should do then. . . .
There are some very interesting tax provisions in this bill, which are similar to the tax credits that we gave generally around the country for people to hire people off welfare, for people who would go into the inner cities in the high-poverty areas. And then there is, for the first time ever, a zero capital gains on people who start trade or businesses in high-poverty areas of D.C. So we are trying to rebuild the economic infrastructure of the city as well. . . .
Q: You wanted a dialogue on race, and you have a dialogue on race right now, the black-white issue, and particularly the issue of an apology for slavery, and reparations. Are you hoping that the issue were to go away by giving it to the race advisory board? Because there is word that you would like it to go away.
A: I don't know that I hope the issue will go away. What I hope the issue -- what I hope will happen is that the issue will not dominate all the other things that need to be discussed about the past, the present, and the future. . . .
There will be dialogue. There will be research and studies done. And there will be policies flowing. And you know, I've already announced the first major policy under this initiative, which is the $250 million program to give people -- to defray the cost of college education for people who will teach in under-served areas.
Q: When this administration calls on the Palestinian Authority to take sustained action to prevent terrorism, what specific steps are you looking for? And secondly, do you personally believe that Yasir Arafat and the Palestinian Authority have fulfilled the obligation to prevent terrorism?
A: Let me answer them in order. No. 1, we expect them to resume meaningful, real, consistent security cooperation with the Israeli authorities in the way that they do when they work best.
No. 2, we expect them to act on the information that they have. You can't hold them to the information that they don't. But they have proven in the past quite effective at rounding up people and arresting them for good cause.
And No. 3, we expect that if there are people there who are really serious threats to the peace and to innocent civilians, they should be kept behind bars, if it is legal to do so. . . .
In answer to your second question, I would have to say that I could not say that there has been constant, 100 percent effort. . . . But I know that it's been discouraging for the Palestinian Authority. I know they get frustrated. I know that sometimes Mr. Arafat feels like he's caught in the middle, between his own population and their discontents and frustration, and his frustrations in dealing with the Israeli government.
But none of that can be an excuse for not maintaining security. If you go back and read Oslo, they promised 100 percent effort on security; No. 1. No. 2, never mind Oslo, you can't have a civilized society if you permit terrorism. And No. 3, in the end, the terrorists are the enemy of moderate, constitutional government among the Palestinians. . . .
Q: You have repeatedly expressed your admiration and support for Governor Weld. But how far are you willing to go to see him confirmed? . . .
A: I believe that Governor Weld would be a good ambassador to Mexico and is rather uniquely situated to be a good ambassador to Mexico because of his background, his experience, his knowledge, because he does know a lot about the drug trafficking and he's been criticized for that. . . . I think at least the man ought to get a hearing and ought to get his day in court, if you will, his day before the committee. And I was encouraged to hear Senator Lugar say that. We've got a team organized in the White House to try to help promote his nomination. And we'll do the very best we can. And we'll see what happens. But I believe he ought to be the ambassador, and I'm going to try to see him confirmed.
Q: In many of the nursing homes owned by corporates there are very few small staffs for a very large number of patients and the staff are paid very little, therefore they take it out on the patients. And some of these patients and many of them are hungry and they're abused and they're mistreated and nationally we ought to do something about it. I'm sure you can.
A: Well, let me say, there are two issues here really in terms of what happens to older people who are not living at home and to some extent in home. There's the nursing home situation, there's the people who are living in institutions that aren't quite nursing homes, and then there are people who are getting home care and the question of whether the home cared are getting actually is what they contracted for and whether they're being properly paid. The Department of Health and Human Services is looking at the question of whether we can streamline and make more effective the regulation of nursing homes and also how we're going to go about getting money stopping spending money in other forms of support for seniors where the money basically is being ripped off through fraud and abuse. And I hope that, over the next few weeks, we will have something to say about that, that will reassure people and their families who are in nursing homes.
Q: Another line-item veto question. You said that some of these candidates for a veto were negotiated in good faith, they're part of the agreement. Could you explain to the American people why a tax cut that benefits 100 or fewer taxpayers is ever in the national interest? It sounds like the very definition of a "special-interest goodie."
A: Well, it's certainly the definition of a "special-interest group," but not all special interests are always in conflict with the general interest. If that were true, our country would not have survived for over 200 years.
But I want to look at them and see, because you say that anything that benefits a hundred or fewer taxpayers must, by definition, be a special interest. But it could be a sector of the economy where there are fewer than a hundred businesses now, where there is a national interest in keeping a certain activity going; alternative -- or something that's good for the environment, for example. I don't know. I don't want to comment because I have not seen these.
But I would think that there are cases -- for example, there may be a case where an injustice was done to a taxpayer, or a small class of taxpayers, and we are trying to fix that. There may be a -- or -- and that's the one case I can think of -- the other case is where there'd be fewer than a hundred firms in a given economic area where we'd want to do something.
Q: A minute ago, in talking about campaign finance reform, you said I will live under any set of rules that are there. But violations of the rules that are in place -- or apparent violations, exactly why there are Thompson hearings in the Senate, why your own Justice Department has an investigation going.
Why don't you appeal to two people who are trying to help you, Charlie Trie and John Huang, to come and tell their story? They've begun to talk to ABC And other media. You make an appeal to them to come and tell what they did, and why they did it, and help move past the investigations that are there now?
A: Well, first of all, the -- I have encouraged, and I will do it again now. I've said I think everybody ought to work out a way to cooperate with this committee, and to get all the information out.
Secondly, the State Department specifically has tried to work with the congressional committees, with regard to anybody who might be out of this country. So, I don't know what else we can do on that. And I certainly have been fully cooperative, and will continue to do so.
But what have we learned in these hearings? We've learned that there were problems. We've learned that -- now we've learned both parties had problems. We've learned that a lot of money was raised, and a lot of money that was spent. And I hope we've also learned that a lot of what was legal -- and that was the import of Allison's question earlier.
I hope we've also learned that a lot of what is legal would be better off if it didn't happen. We'd be better off if we had ceilings on contributions to the political parties. We'd be better off if somebody couldn't give a million dollars to a political party at one pop. And that all leads you back to the same place; we either will or we won't pass a credible campaign finance reform bill this year. Some people would be for it, and some people will be against it.
If the public is permitted to think for a moment that they're all the same and they're all doing it and nobody really wants it, then that is an absolute, lock-down guarantee that no bill will pass. There must be a clear distinction between those who are for and those who are against. And until there is in the public mind, people won't think they're going to be held accountable for that vote, and those who benefit from the present system will do what they can to keep it.
Q: The American Bar Association is considering recommendations to limit the independent counsel statute in their annual meeting in San Francisco this week, a series of recommendations including limiting what offices can be investigated, and the elimination of the need for a final report.
First of all, where do you stand on these recommendations? And second of all, in 1999, if this statute were reauthorized, would you veto it?
A: Well, I think -- let me say first of all, the American Bar Association has taken a great interest in this, and ought to be viewed as a little bit, at least, of a neutral observer here. And they have pointed out some abuses of the law that are general, and some abuses of the law that are specific to certain specific independent counsels.
And I think that in this case, I ought to be like the rest of the country; I ought to wait for their recommendations and study them. I can't comment on their recommendations till I know what they are and what the grounding is. But I'll be eager to hear them.
Q: On tobacco, there were news accounts this week that you plan to take some additional smoking steps pertaining to Federal property. In the coming months and coming year, do you plan to be active on some of the international issues as U.S. companies emphasize sales abroad; things like the World Health Organization's idea for some standards on labeling, or there have been bills introduced in Congress that would prohibit U.S. employees from promoting the export of tobacco products.
A: Well, I think that there may be some multilateral actions that we would want to be a part of. And to be honest with you, I haven't had a great deal of time to think about it.
I know that sales have been declining in the United States and in Latin America, and going up in Asia and in Eastern Europe, and that it's natural to expect that the companies will try to, you know, accelerate the growing markets. And I, you know, I, if they're dangerous to children here, they're dangerous to children there.
What I'm focused on now is completing my evaluation of this proposed settlement, protecting the jurisdiction of the F.D.A. and the victories we've already won, and continuing to advance the health interests of the American people.
But it is inevitable -- it is as inevitable as the sun coming out today that international institutions will be called upon and nations will be called upon to responsibly deal with this.
Q: Next week, India will celebrate 50 years of independence, and you have been invited by New Delhi and also by the Indian community in Washington to attend the functions. Are you going to one of the functions? Also, how do you view the last 50 years of U.S. and India relations, the world's largest two democracies, under your administration?
A: Well, first, I hope to do something here in Washington to recognize the beginning of what will be a yearlong celebration of Indian independence. . . . There'll be some overlap in when Pakistan will be celebrating its 50th year of independence.
And, you know, it's not a very hot issue here in the United States, but it's a source of continuing concern to me that the people of Pakistan and the people of India have not been able to work through their differences, because if they could do so, I'm convinced that they could quickly begin to enjoy economic growth rates at the level of the highest East Asian communities and be our best partners for the future. So I'm hoping that not only can we observe India's anniversary, but that we can be an even better friend in the next 50 years and a more constructive supporter of resolving these difficulties in the near term.
Thank you.

HEADLINE: Congress Cuts $8.3 Million for Governors Island Maintenance

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
The fate of Governors Island has become more unsettled because of little-known Federal budget provisions that eliminate funds to maintain the island and to keep its 19th century village from crumbling.
The provisions, quietly inserted into separate appropriation bills by the Senate and the House of Representatives, cut $8.3 million that had been committed to the United States Coast Guard. The money was to be used in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, mainly for maintenance of the historic village on the northern half of the island, which had been used by the Coast Guard until it vacated the site last month. 
 "If the island is not maintained, its historic area will deteriorate rapidly in the harsh winter weather," said Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, a Manhattan Democrat who has been lobbying in Congress to have the island taken over by the city or state for recreational use.
"Clearly, somebody screwed up," said Tony Bullock, the chief of staff to Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who has taken on the role of chief advocate for the island in the Senate.
"This was a deliberate or unintentional oversight, and we don't know which," he added. "But now everybody knows there is a problem and our job is to get that money restored."
Officials of the Coast Guard and the General Services Administration, to which Congress has assigned responsibility for selling the scenic New York harbor property, said yesterday that they hoped the money would be restored in September, when Congress returns from its summer vacation.
They said the funds could be restored in the routine Congressional process of conference, in which the separate appropriations bills of the House and Senate are fine-tuned to work out minor differences.
The tussle in Congress is the latest in a series of bureaucratic missteps that many New York City planners and environmentalists say could mean Governors Island, a 174-acre tract with unobstructed views of lower Manhattan and the New York harbor, will end up as a missed opportunity for the city and state.
President Clinton has offered to intervene to persuade Congress to turn over the island to New York for $1 if Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Gov. George E. Pataki agree to a plan for redevelopment of the island that would include park space and public access. But since the President made his offer a year ago, the Mayor and the Governor have balked, with neither willing to commit money from their own budgets to pay for ferry service, preserving the island's historic buildings and performing other maintenance.
In the meantime, Congress has made its priority for the island clear -- to sell it to the highest bidder. As part of the balanced budget agreement signed into law by the President on Tuesday, the island is identified as surplus Federal property that is to be sold in the year 2002, with an anticipated price of $500 million.
The $8.3 million in maintenance funding that was eliminated from the Coast Guard budget had been expected to be the first phase in a maintenance program, with similar Federal allocations going to the General Services Administration from 1999 to 2002, when the island would be sold under the Congressional plan.
At City Hall, where advisers to the Mayor have been negotiating with New York University and other institutions in hopes that they would take over part of Governors Island and pay a share of its maintenance costs, the funding cut was harshly criticized yesterday.
"It is an outrage," said Randy L. Levine, Deputy Mayor for Economic Development, Planning and Administration. "It just demonstrates what Congress has had in mind all along. It intends to shortchange New York City and just walk away."
According to Coast Guard officials, the $8.3 million was to be used to pay for a maintenance staff of about 60 people, with fewer than 20 living on the island. Among their responsibilities would have been to paint, plaster and repair leaks in the island's 19th century structures.
Those who have watched conflicting plans for the island unfold said Congress was demonstrating a pattern of bureaucratic miscues and neglect that were similar to its failure during the 1960's to maintain Ellis Island.
"This could all mean that the same people that brought you Ellis Island are abandoning another national treasure," said Robert D. Yaro, executive director of the Regional Plan Association, a planning group that has proposed using Governors Island for marinas, bed and breakfast accommodations, park land and other forms of recreation.
"If this money doesn't get restored we have a crisis," he said.

3-Day Slide In Treasury Prices Ended

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
The Treasury market ended a three-day slide yesterday as the Government's quarterly debt refunding proceeded without stumbling and the latest business survey by the Federal Reserve showed the economy growing but with few traces of inflation.
The 30-year bond rose 6/32, to a price of 101 31/32, pushing the yield down to 6.47 percent, from 6.49 percent on Tuesday. Prices and yields of Treasury securities move in opposite directions. 
 At yesterday's auction of $12 billion in 10-year notes, the average yield came in 6.205 percent, down from 6.740 percent in May and the lowest since 5.649 percent on Feb. 7, 1996.
The Treasury's refunding continues today with a sale of 30-year bonds.
In when-issued trading ahead of the auction of 10-year notes, dealers had been offering the securities at a price to yield 6.20 percent, slightly lower than the previous day, suggesting that investors were starting to see value at these levels, given the current economic conditions.
The anticipation of demand even at these relatively low yields, borne out by the auction results, raised expectations that the recent bond market rally, which had been cut short last Friday, might resume after this week's auctions of debt.
Still, Hugh Whelan, vice president and portfolio manager at Aeltus Investment Management in Hartford, , said he thought the results were only mediocre: while the number of bids was solid, the yield was a bit higher than he had expected. "It feels as though we're getting through the auctions, but with little momentum," he said. "I'd expect a similar behavior with tomorrow's 30-year bond, with a lot of pre-auction jockying around. The auction will go well if we're trading at around 6.50 percent on the long bond; however, if it's closer to 6.45 percent, the auction may not go as well."
In fact, early losses in trading of the 30-year bond yesterday were erased as support emerged at a yield of 6.50 percent, prompting some speculators, who had expected yields to continue to rise, to cover short positions. In when-issued trading ahead of today's auction of $10 billion in new 30-year bonds, dealers were offering the securities at a price to yield 6.44 percent.
While traders were preparing for the auction, there was talk that the Fed might enter the market as a buyer of 10-year notes helped lift prices over all.
The market was also helped by the release of the Fed's beige book report on regional economic conditions, which the central bank uses to help it set interest-rate policy. The report showed continuing moderate growth, but without inflation.
"It will take more than strong growth to prompt the Fed to hike rates in August," said Larry J. Wipf, an economist with the Norwest Corporation in Minneapolis. "Despite a tight labor market, wage inflation remains remarkably subdued.
Mr. Wipf added that while the quarterly debt refunding this week might be expected to put pressure on the Treasury market, robust Government revenue growth and restrainted Federal outlays had slashed Government borrowing needs, while foreign buyers have been snapping up the remaining supply. "If the auctions are well received, the bull market is likely to resume," he said.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
The new tax law encourages savings, but there's a catch.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
AMONG other virtues, the new Federal tax package is supposed to stimulate savings by encouraging families to set aside more for retirement, college and first-time house purchases. And according to some experts, the incentives could make a real difference. "The data are pretty persuasive," argued Martin Feldstein, president of the National Bureau of Economic Research.
But there's a catch: the savings incentives in the new law are offset by new spending incentives -- notably the tax credits for children and for college tuition. 
 Make that catches: the revenue losses could be very large compared with the gain in private savings. So unless Government spending is cut to make up for the erosion in taxes, the impact on national savings (private and government combined) could actually be perverse. "It's entirely possible that the package will reduce savings over all," concluded Bill Gale, an economist at the Brookings Institution.
The two biggest savings initiatives in the tax package consist of an increase on the income limit for eligibility for tax-deductible contributions to individual retirement accounts and the creation of a brand-new form of I.R.A. The latter, dubbed the "Roth I.R.A." in honor of its champion, Senator William Roth of Delaware, allows all but the highest earners to contribute $2,000 annually to special retirement accounts. These contributions are not deductible, but the accumulated income will never be taxed if it is used for college, first-time house purchases or retirement.
The new law also tosses smaller bouquets to potential savers. Education saving accounts will permit parents to set aside $500 a year per child and (Roth I.R.A.-style) withdraw the income, tax-free, for college expenses. It ends the "success tax" -- the surcharge on withdrawals from large pension accumulations that John Shoven, an economist at Stanford University, calculated could raise the effective tax rate on retirement income above 90 percent.
But the package meant to be all things to all people also pares taxes by $400 (later $500) a child for families with incomes below $110,000. "The kiddy tax cut is obviously anti-savings," Mr. Gale argued. "Most people will spend it."
And it provides credits to offset part of parents' college tuition bills. "A lot of this money will be going toward vacations and lawn furniture," predicted Tom Kane, an economist at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government.
Indeed, the broadest objection to tax-based savings incentives is that they are "inefficient" in the sense that they disproportionately erode revenue. Along with Mr. Gale, Eric Engen of the Federal Reserve Board and John Scholz of the University of Wisconsin estimate that from 1980 through 1992 contributions to tax-advantaged retirement plans rose by 1.1 percent of gross domestic product, but personal savings as a percentage of G.D.P. fell.
Without the incentives, personal savings might have fallen even more. But it does seem likely that a chunk of the new retirement money was funneled from ordinary savings. "When you can save the easy way by shifting it, or the hard way by cutting consumption," Mr. Gale said, "most people take the easy way."
Few tax experts seem to object to the elimination of the tax on "excess" withdrawals from very large pension nest eggs. There is also a case to be made for allowing pre-retirement withdrawals for education and home buying. "You need to give 30-year-olds a more pressing reason to save than retirement 40 years later," Mr. Feldstein said.
But in light of the questions over the impact of I.R.A.'s in the past, there is serious doubt about the efficiency of liberalizing eligibility. "Higher-income folks have more discretion to switch savings," pointed out Joel Slemrod, an economist at the University of Michigan Business School.
And there is a lot of head-shaking about the economic logic of "backward looking" tax breaks, such as penalty-free withdrawals of money already in I.R.A,'s or preferences on capital gains earned long ago. After all, cutting the tax liability of investors smart or lucky enough to have purchased, say, General Electric stock in 1990 will not change current savings or investment incentives.
Not surprisingly, then, there is widespread skepticism about the overall impact of the tax bill on savings when the impact on the budget is taken into account. Congress is projecting a loss of $250 billion in tax revenue over the next decade. While it is also projecting a balanced budget in 2002, the revenue crunch will certainly make it harder to keep it in the black thereafter.
Besides, a nation trying to amass capital to keep the retiring baby boomers living in the style to which they have grown accustomed might want to do better than balance. "The surest way to raise savings," Mr. Slemrod noted, "is for the Government to run a surplus."

Albright Sketches Policy For the Middle East
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright outlined a shift in the Clinton Administration's strategy toward the Middle East, hoping to focus Israelis and Palestinians on the goal of peace rather than their myriad grievances. The change reflected Washington's acceptance Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's desire to reach an overall accord directly. A1 

Crown Prince Hassan of Jordan went to Jerusalem but was unable to soften the position taken toward the Palestinian Authority by Mr. Netanyahu after the suicide bombing last week. Mr. Netanyahu said Israel would ease its blockade of the West Bank and Gaza only if Yasir Arafat took action against Islamic militants. Mr. Arafat, for his part, urged his followers to stand firm, reportedly telling them, "the future will be worse than the past." A14
 
Holbrooke Returns to Bosnia
Richard Holbrooke, the American envoy who orchestrated the 1995 Dayton peace accord that brought peace to the Balkans, returned to Bosnia to try to break stalemates in the pact's implementation. One of Mr. Holbrooke's urgent challenges is patching up relations between Bosnian Croats and Muslims, who are joined in a federation that controls 51 percent of Bosnia. He met with the Croatian President, Franjo Tudjman, and the Bosnian Muslim leader, Alija Izetbegovic. The two men "reaffirmed the right of all refugees to return to their homes," a vital part of the peace accord. A3

In Seoul, Korean Air officials struggled to cope with frustrated and angry relatives of the passengers on Flight 801. A9
 
Cambodia Adds Prime Minister
An obedient Parliament ignored a series of constitutional and procedural roadblocks and elected a new Co-Prime Minister, giving Cambodia, by various counts, either one, two or three Prime Ministers. Last month, one of the country's Co-Prime Ministers, Hun Sen, ousted the other one, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, in two days of street fighting that took scores of lives. The legislature elected Foreign Minister Ung Huot to replace Prince Ranariddh, but did not remove Prince Ranariddh from his post. A11
 
Australia Mortified by Report

Judge Rejects Plea Bargain Under Death-Penalty Law
The defendant in what would have been New York City's first trial under the state's new death-penalty law has agreed to plead guilty to murder and serve at least 50 years in prison.

The corner of a five-story apartment building in Brooklyn collapsed, raining tons of debris into the street and sending firefighters and police officers racing through the halls to warn sleeping residents to get out. B3
 
Radio listeners who woke up to a news report about Mayor Giuliani at the early-morning building collapse heard something extraordinary a few seconds later: a political advertisement by the Mayor's campaign boasting that he is always there at a building collapse. "It's eerie," Mr. Giuliani said. "Of course, we didn't have the slightest knowledge when we prepared the ad that this would happen." B3
 
Threat to Governors Island
The fate of Governors Island has become more unsettled because of little-known provisions, which are part of the Federal budget, that eliminate funds to maintain the island.

HEADLINE: For the Teamsters' Leader, U.P.S. Is an Ancient Enemy

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
In many ways, the strike against the United Parcel Service is the fight that Ronald Carey, the teamsters' president who began as a U.P.S. deliveryman in Queens, has been preparing for in his three decades as a union leader.
A quarter-century ago, when he headed a New York teamsters local representing thousands of U.P.S. workers, Mr. Carey served as the field marshal in several successful strikes to win a better pension and to limit the use of part-time workers. 
 Today, he is using the expertise and experience gleaned from those battles to fight again, although this time on a much bigger playing field. Back then, the strikes disrupted deliveries in just five boroughs; the walkout that began on Monday has halted deliveries in all 50 states and involves more workers than any other strike in the 1990's.
But the current walkout comes at an awkward time for Mr. Carey because it trains a spotlight on him when Federal prosecutors have charged some of his campaign aides with illegally diverting union funds to his re-election war chest.
Mr. Carey's aides acknowledge that he and the entire 1.4-million-member union have planned for this showdown ever since he was elected president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters in 1991. Not only are U.P.S. workers Mr. Carey's base and his most loyal supporters, but he also knows this particular adversary better than any other. And he has long been concerned about the overarching issue in the strike: the company's growing use of part-time workers.
"This is an issue that has been troubling me since 1968, when I was first elected president of a local," Mr. Carey said in a telephone interview last night. "I think this is a really important issue that the country has to do something about."
Tony Magrene, who worked as a U.P.S. driver and shop steward with Mr. Carey in the 1960's, recalled in an interview that Mr. Carey, as president of teamsters' Local 804, led it through a painful 14-week strike in 1974 over part-time workers.
"Ron Carey would not keep people recklessly on the street," Mr. Magrene said. "He knows it's the last card you play. He knows that strikes are very hard."
Mr. Magrene said Mr. Carey had worked feverishly to help strikers make ends meet in the 1974 walkout. In that strike, Mr. Carey pressured U.P.S. not to reduce the number of full-time sorters and replace them with part-time workers.
Mr. Carey insists that he ordered the strike and risked disrupting the nation's economy for the noblest of reasons: to help 185,000 unionized U.P.S. workers, especially the more than 100,000 part-timers, whose starting pay is $8 to $9 an hour. He contends that sorters and loaders earning $200 a week for 20 hours' work cannot support their families.
"It's unfortunate the company has failed to recognize the needs of our members, the needs for the future: good, decent jobs," Mr. Carey said. "Half a job is not enough."
But Mr. Carey's many detractors inside and outside the union suggest that his motives are less than pure. They say that Mr. Carey, who was elected to the presidency on a platform of cleaning up what was the nation's most corrupt union, is desperate to distract attention from the fund-raising scandal.
Prosecutors have charged a Carey campaign fund-raiser with managing a scheme in which the union awarded a contract to a telemarketing firm that then funneled tens of thousands of dollars to the campaign. His aides say he knew nothing about such contributions.
These detractors also suggest that Mr. Carey has orchestrated the strike as a convenient way to rally members of his highly fractured union behind him.
The man he narrowly defeated in the union election last December, James P. Hoffa, son of the former teamsters' leader, has asked the Federal election overseer to order a new election because of the charges of financial improprieties. And some detractors say Mr. Carey asserted that having the national spotlight trained on him this week would make it harder for the overseer to overturn the election, especially if he emerges victorious from the strike.
"His position in the union was weak, and that partly motivated his decision to go on strike," said Leo Troy, a professor of labor relations at Rutgers University.
U.P.S. officials have also questioned Mr. Carey's motives, suggesting that he is trying to divert attention from internal union problems.
"He is highly irresponsible," Gina Ellrich, a U.P.S. spokeswoman, said of the 61-year-old union leader. "There is more to this strike than the welfare of U.P.S. people because we made a superb offer which Ron Carey has refused. We think it's inappropriate to speculate to what else is motivating Ron Carey to lead this strike, but obviously there are a number of other issues he's facing."
Mr. Carey said his detractors were wrong to suggest that he could lead 185,000 workers into a strike like lambs, just to take people's minds off a union campaign scandal.
"That's all bull being spun out by the company and by my opponents," Mr. Carey said. He added that he did not want a strike but that the company had forced him into it by making a patently unacceptable offer.
Gregory Tarpinian, president of the Labor Research Association, said, "I don't think anybody who calls a strike like this is driven by ulterior political motives."
Mr. Tarpinian said that since the rank and file had high expectations in the U.P.S. dispute, Mr. Carey would be badly weakened if he accepted the company's latest offer, which calls for a 1.5 percent yearly raise for full-time workers and no raise in the part-timers' starting wage, unchanged since 1982.
He said another proposal that Mr. Carey could not swallow was the company's intent to pull out of the teamsters' multiemployer pension plans, a move that could anger hundreds of thousands of teamsters who belong to the plans but work for other employers.
"He needs a win here," Mr. Tarpinian said. "He needs a win because part-timers at U.P.S. need something. This is Carey's political base, and there are internal problems in the union, so he has to show that he's in charge, that he can deliver."
Mr. Carey was propelled to the union's presidency on the strength of his reputation as a reformer and as a leader beyond reproach. Entering this strike, however, both perceptions were under fire.
In his first five years as the teamsters' president, he won rave reviews for cleaning up the union. He sold off the union's two jets, ended the free lunches at headquarters and stopped holding union conferences in Hawaii. He placed more than 70 of the teamsters' 651 locals into trusteeship, dismissing suspect leaders.
Although Hoffa supporters have rallied behind Mr. Carey in the strike, some still criticize him for negotiating an agreement with long-haul trucking companies that allowed the companies to ship more goods by rail.
But a successful end to the strike would muffle many critics. "If he comes out getting a good contract and playing his cards right, he will come out strong," said Michael Belzer, a professor of labor relations at Cornell University.

HEADLINE: CLINTON ON THE ISSUES: THE OVERVIEW;
Deficit to Drop To $37 Billion, President Says

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 6

 BODY:
A day after signing laws to balance the Federal budget and cut taxes, President Clinton announced today that the Federal deficit was expected to drop to $37 billion this year, its lowest level in 23 years.
Mr. Clinton used the new deficit projection from the Office of Management and Budget, which was $30 billion lower than projections made in May, to rebut critics who had questioned whether the robust economy alone would balance the budget without the five-year plan that Mr. Clinton and the Congress put in place. 
 "Without the bipartisan balanced budget we just passed, our budget officials estimate the deficit would rise next year to $50 to $100 billion, and stay at that level for years to come," he said. "With our bipartisan balanced-budget plan, we now expect it not only to reach balance by 2002, but to have a surplus in excess of $20 billion." [Excerpts, page A28.]
In a nearly hourlong news conference, the President ranged across many domestic and foreign policy issues, urging a fair hearing for former Gov. William F. Weld, his nominee as ambassador to Mexico, and saying he did not want a debate over whether to apologize for slavery to dominate his yearlong initiative on race.
The President also said that he expected to use his newly acquired line-item-veto power to strike out either a narrowly focused tax break or a spending measure from the budget and tax laws.
And in one striking moment, Mr. Clinton went on the offensive to justify his continued fund-raising for his party. Reminded that he continued to raise for Democrats the kind of unregulated, soft-money donations that he has said should be banned, he cut off the questioner and said, "I certainly do, and I'm proud of it.
"We live in a competitive world," he added. "The Republicans raise more money, raise more big money, and raise more money from noncitizens than the Democrats do. But we have to raise enough to be competitive."
But Mr. Clinton also said that he would give "strong support" to legislation to overhaul the system and to ban soft money, changes that sponsors hope to bring up for a vote in the Senate this fall. "It is very important that every American know where every single elected Federal official in Washington stands on this issue," he said.
Asked if he would push for two fund-raisers with past ties to him -- John Huang and Yah Lin Trie -- to cooperate with the Senate committee investigating campaign finance practices, Mr. Clinton repeated a general appeal for everyone to cooperate with the committee. He said the State Department had worked with the committee to track witnesses overseas.
"So I don't know what else we can do on that," he said. Mr. Trie is in China, and Mr. Huang has refused to testify without at least partial immunity from prosecution.
Fresh from signing the balanced-budget legislation that ended years of partisan combat in Washington, Mr. Clinton was alternately high-spirited, joking and combative.
He used the news conference to highlight his economic policies and set out a future agenda. His call to action included winning Congressional backing for new authority to negotiate trade agreements, for changing the Social Security and Medicare systems to prepare for the retirement of the baby-boom generation and for an overhaul of campaign finance laws.
"All these challenges will require bipartisan cooperation," he said. "Many of them will require difficult decisions. But this balanced budget and the prosperity we are now enjoying gives us a rare opportunity to take these steps for the long-term well-being of our country."
When Mr. Clinton took office in 1993, he faced a deficit that had reached a high of $290 billion. By last year, it had dropped to $107 billion. And today Mr. Clinton announced that because of the thriving economy, the deficit was now projected to be smaller than had been expected, down to $37 billion by the time the fiscal year ends Sept. 30.
The new deficit projection by the Office of Management and Budget would be the lowest Federal deficit since 1974, when the Government's shortfall was $6.1 billion.
Mr. Clinton attributed the declining deficits to his economic policies since 1993, when he succeeded in getting a Democratic Congress to pass a deficit-reduction package that included a tax increase mostly on the wealthy. Today he described 1993 as the year "we abandoned supply-side, trickle-down economics." He praised the most recent balanced-budget deal for finishing that work by leading to an expected surplus in 2002.
Pressed on whether a balanced budget would have been reached sooner if $95 billion in tax cuts had not been included in the budget plan, Mr. Clinton skirted the question and defended the tax reduction package as a "good and balanced one" that was a "small fraction of the size" of the Reagan tax cut of 1981, which he said added to the growing deficit.
On the line-item veto, Mr. Clinton said his aides were examining a list of narrowly focused tax breaks and spending items in the balanced-budget laws to see if any were "sufficiently objectionable" to prompt his veto. "I'm assuming that there will be something in there that was not agreed to by all of us in the budget agreement, that seems to me to be a good candidate for it," he said.
Mr. Clinton was asked what he would do to win confirmation for Mr. Weld as ambassador to Mexico, despite opposition from Senator Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina. Mr. Clinton at first joked, "I thought maybe I'd go down to Mexico and jump off those cliffs at Acapulco."
But quickly becoming serious, he defended Mr. Weld against criticism by Mr. Helms, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, that he was not tough enough on drugs. "At least the man ought to get a hearing," he said, "and ought to get his day in court, if you will, his day before the committee."
On complaints that a new Federal aid package for the District of Columbia shifted power away from the elected Mayor and City Council to a financial control board, Mr. Clinton said that the power shift was required by the Republican Congress as a "condition of getting financial relief" for the strapped city.
When Mr. Clinton was asked his position on a Federal apology for slavery, he said that he had referred the question to an advisory group he has set up to examine questions of race relations. "What I hope will happen," he said, "is that the issue will not dominate all the other things that need to be discussed about the past, the present and the future."

The Bauhaus: Utopian Ideas and Constant Uproar

BYLINE: By HERBERT MUSCHAMP

 BODY:

BAUHAUS
Crucible of Modernism
By Elaine S. Hochman
Illustrated. 371 pages. Fromm International. $29.95.
 Elaine S. Hochman's great theme is the fragility of the liberal imagination. In two fine books, Ms. Hochman has examined this subject through the lens of modern German architecture. Her "Architects of Fortune," published in 1989, cast a glaring light on Ludwig Mies van der Rohe's attempts to cut deals with the culture czars of the Third Reich. In her new book, "Bauhaus: Crucible of Modernism," Ms. Hochman chronicles the fluctuating political fortunes of the century's most influential art school.
Founded in 1919 by the architect Walter Gropius, the Bauhaus was originally based in Weimar, and later in Dessau. The school operated for only 14 years, its life span corresponding precisely to that of the Weimar Republic. Like the theater of Brecht or the drawings of George Grosz, the Bauhaus came to stand for the Weimar period's heady creative ferment. 
 Bauhaus roll call! Count off now! Paul Klee! Lyonel Feininger! Oskar Schlemmer! Wassily Kandinsky! Ludwig Mies van der Rohe! Marcel Breuer! Theo van Doesburg! Josef Albers! Laszlo Moholy-Nagy! These are just a few of the eminent artists who taught, not always happily or for long, at the school.
Painters like Kandinsky and Klee were second-rate citizens here. Though the school's predecessor institution, the Weimar Art Academy, was known for training in the fine arts, under Gropius the school shifted its focus to architecture, the applied arts, and crafts. In the workshops and studios of Gropius, Mies, Breuer, Mart Stam and Marianne Brandt, the school developed the refined, machine-age esthetic with which it became synonymous.
Ms. Hochman is not primarily concerned, however, with the art the Bauhaus produced. Rather, she focuses on the political turbulence unleashed by Gropius's utopian ideas. Her emphasis is apt. Unlike the International Style derived from its formative ideas, the Bauhaus was committed as firmly to social as to esthetic reform. Or, more accurately, Gropius regarded the two as indivisible. He had other things on his mind than well-designed chairs and teapots, handsome as many of those objects turned out to be. His goal was to transform modern life.
Gropius's contemporaries were no more comfortable with the idea of political art than many Americans are today. A popular "come to the cabaret" myth holds that Weimar Germany was a golden age of creative freedom that ended only when the Nazis stormed into power. The truth is that the era's artistic flowering took place amid opposition that makes our culture wars look like the Pepsi Challenge.
Based on the precedent of the British Arts and Crafts movement, the Bauhaus promoted itself as a model vehicle for educational reform. To us, this objective may seem unexceptionably benign. In Weimar Germany, it was a red flag, literally. Educational reform was as recognizably a part of the Marxist objective as economic redistribution.
So, too, the school's machine esthetic was unmistakably a symbolic expression of solidarity with industrial workers. The very notion of transforming an academy of fine arts into a crafts school was an act of social leveling. It was recognized and resented as such.
Ms. Hochman gives a precise account of Gropius's reforms and of the inevitable outrage they provoked. The Bauhaus was a state school, dependent on Government funds and subject to official review. The school also needed the good will of the trade associations that presided over the professional fields that Bauhaus students were being trained, at least in theory, to enter. Clashes with these authorities were unavoidable and frequent.
Ms. Hochman's account is factual, not essayistic. She is better than Joseph McCarthy at pinning down the exact number of Bauhaus students who belonged to the school's Communist cell (15, about 10 percent of the student body); she examined the banners they designed for street demonstrations, and records Gropius's ambivalent feelings toward their political activities. She documents the efforts of Government officials to intervene in the school's policies and describes the intricate ruses Gropius devised to forestall and placate them.
She also details the constant uproars within the school itself. Kandinsky and other artists opposed Gropius's plans to market the products of the school's workshops. Students and faculty members fought over the profits from these sales. Campaigns were waged against designers like van Doesburg, who preferred abstraction to technology. Student newsletters ridiculed Gropius's denials that he was creating a Bauhaus style.
It's chilling, of course, to follow this account of idealistic artists, knowing the fate that awaits them: in April 1933, three months after Hitler became Chancellor, the Gestapo moved in and shut the school down.
What is the legacy of the Bauhaus today? Ms. Hochman's only major stumble occurs at the end of the book, when she tries to answer this question. Somewhat lamely, she praises Richard Meier and Frank Gehry for "continuing to refine, re-examine and reinterpret the modernism the Bauhaus came to exemplify." It's disappointing, after reading a book that goes so far toward liberating the Bauhaus from formalist preoccupations, to find its author limiting the school's contribution to matters of form.
If Gropius left one enduring idea, it is that artists should not distance themselves from their times. They should leap into the fray and see what good they can accomplish there. Instead of keeping a safe distance from the smelly swamp of worldly values, they should dive right in and stir things up.
This ideal is more pervasive now than it was when the modern movement was in bloom. To paraphrase Gropius, modern Apollos want to make it in the marketplace; an artist's integrity stands to be strengthened, not compromised, by reckoning with the social reality. This belief may be every bit as utopian as the socialist dream of remaking the world through art. And why not?

HEADLINE: With Hong Kong, China Doesn't Need W.T.O.

 BODY:

To the Editor:
The Clinton Administration wisely insists on viable commercial terms for China's entry to the World Trade Organization, not the political convenience occasioned by the visit of President Jiang Zemin to Washington in October (front page, Aug. 4). But an Aug. 5 editorial overlooks one important aspect. 
 While China indeed "already reaps, without making concessions, the benefit of 'most-favored-nation' status in the United States and most other countries," Beijing has another way now to reap those low-tariff benefits that would be granted under the organization -- through Hong Kong.
Since its reversion to China last month, Hong Kong has retained its seat in the organization. Because exports from Hong Kong receive low-tariff treatment under the W.T.O., and trade between the mainland and Hong Kong is now internal trade, China can direct its exports through Hong Kong to the world.
China has not made up its mind to accept the trade organization's terms, because the entry can have a potential impact on its state-owned enterprises, which still employ the majority of workers.
However, once it gains admission, Beijing will get permanent most-favored-nation status, making United States Congressional debate over China's trade status obsolete. Since Chinese membership is not forthcoming, the trade organization should de-link Taiwan's application from China's and proceed on Taiwan's.

HEADLINE: Shylock on Wall Street

 BODY:

To the Editor:
"Even Nature Can Be Turned Into a Security" (Business Day, Aug. 6) describes catastrophe bonds as a new instrument dreamed up by Wall Street. However, as all Shakespeare scholars know, catastrophe bonds, known then as contracts of bottomry, were the standard method of insuring ships from Roman times through the Middle Ages. 
 Shipowners usually borrowed to finance a voyage, and if the ship went down, the loan was forgiven. This contract fell out of use when the Roman Catholic Church ruled that the high rates of interest amounted to usury. When Shylock says "I'll have my bond," he of course means his catastrophe bond.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Pound Drops as Central Bank Acts and Takes Dollar With It

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The British pound tumbled yesterday after the Bank of England signaled that British interest rates had risen enough for now, and the dollar fell in sympathy against most leading currencies.
The pound fell to a 10-month low against the dollar and a one-month low against the German mark while the dollar posted its first loss against the mark after surging to a string of eight-year highs. 
 The British central bank raised its official interest rate to 7 percent from 6.75 percent, its fourth consecutive monthly increase, but released a statement saying it had no immediate plans for future rate rises, prompting heavy selling of pounds, traders said.
Higher interest rates tend to raise the value of a currency by increasing the price of assets denominated in that currency.
"When they raised interest rates in the morning, they said basically this was the last one, and that was the reason sterling went down," said Hans Boman, chief spot currency dealer at Swedbank in New York.
The Bank of England also said that the sharp rally in the pound, which before the selloff had risen 16 percent against the German mark so far in 1997, was pressuring British businesses by making their goods more expensive in global markets.
The pound touched an intraday low at $1.5780, its weakest since October, before settling in New York trading at $1.5893, down from $1.6021 late Wednesday.
The pound's broad decline indirectly helped other currencies strengthen against the dollar. The dollar slipped to 1.8683 marks in New York from 1.8815 marks.
Traders said the pound's decline also gave investors a chance to book profits from the dollar's sharp rally.
"We saw sterling lead the way up for the dollar for a long time and now that sterling is coming back down, that undermined the dollar against the mark and yen a bit," said Earl Johnson, foreign exchange economist at Bank of Montreal in Chicago.
Against the Japanese yen, the dollar fell in part on expectations that a report today will show Japan's current account surplus -- the broadest measure of trade -- widened sharply in June. The dollar settled at 118.45 yen, down from 118.68 yen on Wednesday.

A Saint Besieged: Heaven Knows, Many Need Help

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, Aug. 7

 BODY:
Unable to feed his family after losing his job as a welder last year, Roberto Fuentes went to church on Wednesday afternoon to petition St. Cayetano, the patron saint of bread and work.
But Mr. Fuentes had to wait in line, a rather long line stretching 15 city blocks, as Argentines flocked to pay homage to St. Cayetano, a priest who used his family fortune to help the poor of Naples and who died on Aug. 7, 1547. 
 After waiting 18 hours through a freezing winter night, Mr. Fuentes, 32, burst into tears and walked on his knees when he entered St. Cayetano Sanctuary on the outskirts of Buenos Aires.
"As it was in your day, St. Cayetano, the Government ignores those in need," Mr. Fuentes said, kneeling before a statue of the saint. "We are hungry, we are cold, we are suffering. All we have is you, Saint."
It was a scene repeated over and over again today as more than a million people passed through the church -- a record turnout, according to police estimates.
On seeing the small statue of St. Cayetano, which cradles a baby Jesus in its arms, many people gasped, crossed themselves or prayed loudly as they held rosaries. Some kissed or placed their hands on the glass encasing the statue. An elderly woman fainted at the foot of the statue but was revived by Red Cross workers, who said she had forgotten to eat during the nine hours she waited.
Church officials said the vast pilgrimage was an extraordinary outpouring of faith and proof that Roman Catholicism was still relevant in Argentina despite the recent growth of Protestantism and sects.
But critics of President Carlos Saul Menem's Government said the large turnout reflected just how desperate Argentines have become after years of record unemployment and declining salaries in a country that was accustomed to lifelong employment.
The jobless rate has more than doubled since Mr. Menem came to power in 1989, making it the top issue for midterm congressional elections in October. Mr. Menem's policies have brought stability to an economy once plagued by runaway inflation, but his reforms, including opening markets to imports and selling state-owned businesses, have put millions out of work.
While the latest unemployment figures, for the first three months of the year, declined to 16.1 percent compared with 17.3 percent for last year, tens of thousands of Argentines are continuing to block roads and stage demonstrations up and down the country to protest the Government's economic program. By contrast, the unemployment rate in the United States is 5 percent, a 25-year low.
"Putting an end to Menemism is the only way we can move forward," said Carlos Santillanhe, widely known as Mad Dog, the head of the Government workers' union. "Menem has brought Argentina only more hunger, more unemployment and more desperation."
Mr. Menem has dismissed the protests as "subversion." He maintains that the country's robust economic growth combined with new laws to reduce the cost of labor will create more jobs. "They can stage a thousand marches but nothing will change," he has frequently said in response to protests.
Church officials said the Government's inflexibility perhaps explained why the number of Argentines who came to honor St. Cayetano was so large this year.
"Argentines are an intelligent people and they know where to go when they need help, especially material things," said the Rev. Fernando Maletti, who oversees St. Cayetano Sanctuary. "They know when it's appropriate to block roads, or to knock on the door of a Government agency, or to go to church and ask God or the saints for what they need."
But the Rev. Guillermo Marco, a member of the media commission for the Roman Catholic Church of Buenos Aires, said that while the lines to see St. Cayetano get longer when unemployment is higher, the anniversary of the saint's death 450 years ago today should not only be used as a barometer of joblessness.
Indeed, many people stood in line for hours today to thank the saint for jobs and blessings that they received years ago. To express their gratitude, many brought canned goods, used clothing and medicines to be given to the poor. At the end of the day, church officials said they had received more than 110,000 pounds of food.
But of all those who came to worship, no one seemed to match the devotion of Noris de Navalla, who camped out in front of the church for two months just to be the first person in line when the doors opened at midnight.
"For 16 years, I've always been the first one in line," Mrs. de Navalla, 64, said, as she warmed her hands over a small burner in her tent.
Leonor Castillo, 62, who shivered under heavy blankets in a tent next to Mrs. de Navalla, whom she has known for 16 years, disagreed. "In reality, this year I arrived first, but I don't want to have problems with my neighbors, so I left the space to her."

HEADLINE: Venezuela and Trinidad Square Off Over Oil Treasure

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER

DATELINE: PORT OF SPAIN, Trinidad and Tobago, Aug. 7

 BODY:
A long-simmering boundary dispute over the petroleum-rich straits and gulf that separate Trinidad and Venezuela is flaring up again, with American oil companies caught squarely in the middle.
For decades, each country has accused fishermen from the other of illegally entering its waters, but generally tolerated such abuses because its own vessels were doing the same. But with both countries eager to expand their reserves and exports of oil and gas, they have been taking a much harder line since a fishing agreement expired two years ago. 
 Altercations in the Gulf of Paria have become more and more common, with Venezuelan patrol boats routinely running off or even boarding Trinidadian oil rigs and fishing vessels. At the gulf's narrowest point, at its northern end, the distance between the countries is only seven miles.
American oil companies like Amoco, Texaco, Enron and Conoco have large investments in both countries, and some have been doing exploratory drilling in or near the disputed area.
"You've got Americans on both sides," a diplomat here said. "Everyone who is here has interests over there too."
The United States imports more oil from Venezuela, which President Clinton is scheduled to visit this fall, than from any other country -- 1.65 million barrels a day. But American companies also have a large stake in five big petrochemical plants here, including a $1 billion liquid natural gas project that will send much of its production to the Northeast United States when completed in 1999.
Oil and its derivatives are the backbone of Trinidad's economy, accounting for a third of Government revenues and just under half of all exports. But proven reserves total less than 12 more years of production, and this Caribbean island country of 1.25 million people has been looking to expand its own production and to encourage its much larger neighbor to send some oil and gas to be refined here.
In mid-April, Venezuela said that a joint venture between Trinidad's state oil company and Texaco was conducting illegal exploratory drilling in its waters and sent troops on an armed vessel to board a drilling platform and a tugboat. The company had a Trinidadian license to operate in the gulf area, where Trinidad gets one-fourth of its daily production of 130,000 barrels of crude oil, but Venezuela said the drilling was in its territory.
Trinidad's Foreign Minister, Ralph Maraj, then warned that the situation was "heading into very deep waters." To avoid further problems, he said, "we should allow a third country to look at it to insure that things do not get out of hand."
The incident followed several instances in which Venezuelan vessels fired at, arrested, jailed or fined Trinidadian fishing boats and captains for what it said were violations of the maritime boundary between the two nations established by a treaty in 1990. After a Trinidadian fisherman was shot in one such confrontation, there were calls in the local press for the Government to take a stronger stance against Venezuela.
In an interview here, Prime Minister Basdeo Panday said he believes "the whole thing has been really blown out of proportion," and sounded a conciliatory tone. "I believe the matter can be solved by mutual agreement, peacefully, by diplomatic means."
"There is no way we can have tense relations between our countries," added Mr. Panday, who has twice traveled to Venezuela to meet with President Rafael Caldera in recent months. "Both countries have to cooperate and work together, and I am sure that can happen, this hiccup notwithstanding."
"We were hoping to cooperate with the Venezuelans in the exploration of Venezuelan oil resources and gas," Mr. Panday said. He attributed the dispute to the fact that "the systems both countries have of determining locations might be different," which leads to doubt "where the incidents are actually taking place." He said that "a technological solution" could be reached if the countries agreed to "a common method of calculating where things are."
Two months after being summoned home for "consultations," Venezuela's Ambassador to Trinidad, Efrain Silva Mendez, returned here on Aug. 1 and met with Mr. Maraj this week. But he has declined all requests for interviews. The Venezuelan Foreign Ministry, though, has repeatedly warned in statements that its authorities "will continue to fulfill their constitutional duties pursuing the preservation of the integrity and sovereignty" of their territorial waters.
The United States and other countries that have interests in the region say they fear the dispute is distracting Trinidadian and Venezuelan coastal forces, to the advantage of drug traffickers. The Orinoco River delta, just south of Trinidad, has become an increasingly important route for drugs from Colombia, with an estimated 24 tons of cocaine having moved through last year on its way to Europe and the United States.
"If this doesn't get resolved, the only assets they do get are going to be devoted to defending national sovereignty and the fishermen," a diplomat said, referring to planes and ships the United States has recently supplied to Trinidad. "We would all love to see them cooperating and jointly patrolling the waters."

HEADLINE: Stocks Fall From Records, With Dow Retreating 71.31

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Stocks retreated from records yesterday, hurt by a slump in the Treasury market.
The Dow Jones industrial average, in a topsy-turvy session, fell 71.31 points, to 8,188.00. The Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 9.13 points, to 951.19, and the Nasdaq composite index declined 6.26 points, to 1,624.18, ending seven consecutive sessions of gains. All began the day at record levels. 
 Stocks tumbled in the afternoon as bond prices fell. While the yield on the new 30-year Treasury bond, which was auctioned yesterday, fell to 6.44 percent from 6.47 percent, the yield on the old 30-year bond rose to 6.52 percent.
Higher rates raise the cost of borrowing for consumers and companies, slowing the economy. Higher rates can also undermine bank profits, and shares of the nation's biggest banks fell. Citicorp declined 3 3/8, to 136 1/2; the BankAmerica Corporation lost 2 1/4, to 70 1/2, and the Chase Manhattan Corporation fell 2 7/8, to 109.
Falling interest rates and rising profits have been the bedrock of the bull market. The Dow industrials, including dividends, have almost tripled in the last five years.
Lately, though, some investors question whether these conditiions can continue. Joe Stocke, chief of equities at Meridian Investment Company of Valley Forge, Pa., with $2 billion under management, said concern had heightened since Labor Department figures on Friday showing robust job growth, touching off fears that inflation may accelerate and prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. "Investors are concerned the economy may be doing too well," he said. "After a number of years of expansion, salaries may be going up and it will get tougher to keep profit margins growing."
The Dow rose as much as 41 points yesterday before paring gains and falling. Traders said with few fresh economic statistics and many investors on vacation, the market lacked direction.
Apple Computer Inc. was the most active stock, rising 2 7/8, to 29 3/16, in trading of 33 million shares. On Wednesday, Apple's co-founder, Steven P. Jobs, announced a $150 million investment by the Microsoft Corporation and a shake-up of Apple's board. Apple is up about 47 percent in two days. Microsoft rose 1/2, to 143 15/16.
Fisher Scientific International fell 1 3/8, to 49 1/2, after an investor group led by Thomas H. Lee Companies. agreed to buy the company for $1.4 billion. Fisher shareholders will receive $51 a share, and will also get approximately 10.3 percent common stock ownership in the recapitalized company.
The Compaq Computer Corporation rose 3 1/2, to 62 1/8. The computer maker was raised to "recommended list" from "buy" by an analyst, Kevin A. McCarthy at the Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corporation. Compaq's share price has doubled in 1997, and nearly tripled in the last 12 months.
Caterpillar Inc. rose 2 3/16, to 60 11/16, after a Merrill Lynch analyst, James McCann, raised his estimate on the company to "accumulate."
The National Semiconductor Corporation rose 1 13/16, to 34 3/4, after it was raised to "buy" from "outperform" by James Barlage, an analyst at Smith Barney. The 12-month price target is $40 a share.

HEADLINE: Residential Real Estate;
Two Luxury Projects May Cast Shadows on the West Village

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE

 BODY:
Plans for two luxury condominium buildings are reflecting the increased interest of developers in the western fringe of Greenwich Village, raising community concerns that an area known for its quaint brownstones, loft warehouses and river views will soon be crowded with high-rise buildings that could change the character of the neighborhood.
Developers said that the two projects would be the first condominiums to be built in the neighborhood in five years and that similar projects may be on the way. One of the condominium buildings, 15 stories at 296-298 West 10th Street, a half-block from the West Side Highway, will be completed by the end of the year. The 23-unit project is being built by Christopher Street Associates, using air rights from an adjacent building. 
 The other building, to start construction next month, is being planned by the Rockrose Development Corporation, a Manhattan company long active in the West Village, where it has developed more than 1,300 rental apartments. The company's new project at 99 Jane Street calls for 84 condominium units in an 11-story building.
Among the factors fueling interest in the neighborhood between Hudson Street and the Hudson River are the city's strong housing market, the shortage of building sites elsewhere in the neighborhood, the reconstruction of the West Side Highway and the building of the Hudson River Park from Battery Park City to 59th Street, brokers said.
Estimates from Community Board 2, which guides growth in the West Village, are that in addition to those projects there are about six others planned for the area west of Washington Street to West Street. They could produce a total of another 150 units, mostly condominiums and co-ops, said Arthur W. Strickler, the board's district manager.
But such projects raise concerns within the neighborhood that more development will also bring more tall buildings. The Greenwich Village Historic District does not extend west of Washington Street, to the area in which the recent activity is taking place, so that area lacks the barriers to development, like restrictions on height, that accompany historic-district designation.
To protect the neighborhood, the community board is stepping up its effort to create a Waterfront Historic District, said Ben Green, chairman of the community board.
The board would also like to restrict the use of air rights to put up other tall buildings, which "are damaging the very context and character of the area and the reason workers and residents are attracted to it," he said.
Officials of Christopher Street L.L.C. said they understood the neighborhood's concerns, but said their building needed to be more than 10 stories to be economically feasible.
"We want to blend with the community," said Frank A. Raccuglia Jr. of Christopher Street. "We didn't want to build a contemporary building, so we used a traditional finish of subtle red brick."
Rockrose and Christopher Street are betting that their projects will draw families who will want to live in an area with more of a sense of neighborhood than is offered by high-rise canyons elsewhere in the city.
Andrew S. Heiberger, president of Citi Habitats, a Manhattan brokerage, said the area's rental market is tight, with monthly rents typically $3,500 for a two-bedroom rental and $4,500 for a three-bedroom.
"As rents go up there is more of an incentive for renters to look for a sales option," Mr. Heiberger added.
Thomas Elghanayan, president of Rockrose, said his company had switched from a rental project, as originally planned, to condominiums, because "a lot of families are coming into the area and they are more interested in owning than renting."
The building will contain mostly three-bedroom apartments, though there will also be some with two, four and five bedrooms. The sizes and prices of the apartments have not been set, but Mr. Elghanayan said they will plenty of open space and high ceilings.
At Christopher Street's building, the apartments will have two bedrooms, two bedrooms plus a den or three bedrooms, with 950 to 1,550 square feet and ceiling heights of 8 to 10 feet. Some of the larger units will occupy full floors, and there will also be a three-story penthouse.
"There has been no new condominium construction in the area in the last five years and we feel the project will fill a niche in the area where there hasn't been enough emphasis on large apartments," Mr. Raccuglia said.
But making the $10 million project economically feasible required the use of air rights, said Steven Haskell of Christopher Street. That permitted the building, which under zoning would have been limited to 10 stories, to be five stories taller.
The added height will also provide the building with light and clear river views, which "will more than compensate for its proximity to the highway," added Robert G. Eychner, president of Eychner Associates, the project's sales agent. Most of the apartments will have balconies or terraces.
The price for the apartments, excluding the penthouse, is expected to range from $400 to $600 a square foot, which is on par for the area. Citi Habitats puts the average sales price at $450 a square foot for two-bedroom condominiums and $525 for those with three bedrooms.
For example, a 1,500-square-foot three-bedroom apartment on the 11th floor would cost $900,000. Monthly maintenance fees, including real estate taxes, are expected to be just under $1,000 to $1,400, Mr. Eychner said. Sales are expected to start within the next 45 days.

HEADLINE: Diplomat to Make Trip to Urge Reduction of U.S. Dues to U.N.

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Aug. 7

 BODY:
Bill Richardson, the United States representative at the United Nations, said today that he would make a round-the-world trip beginning on Monday to persuade key countries to support reduced American payments to the organization.
He will also promote a Clinton Administration proposal to make Japan, Germany and three third world nations permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, thereby increasing the number of permanent members from 5 to 10 and the overall membership in the Council from 15 to 20. Developing nations would compete for the three permanent third world seats. 
 The reduction of American payments to the United Nations, a Congressional prerequisite for releasing money to pay any of the more than $1 billion that Washington owes, is a contentious issue among diplomats here. A new payment scale, requiring action by the 185-member General Assembly, would mean that several other countries would have to pick up the shortfall and agree to higher assessments. China, which pays less than one percent of the budget, will be one of Mr. Richardson's candidates for higher assessments. Many nations believe that the Chinese economy has grown enough to make a higher payment reasonable.
The United States now pays 25 percent of the general organization's budget, a rate based on the country's share of the world economy. An agreement between Congress and the Clinton Administration calls for a reduction to 20 percent over three years.
Mr. Richardson told reporters today that his trip would focus primarily on Asia, with additional stops in Russia, Georgia, the Ukraine and France. In Asia, he plans to visit South Korea, Japan, China, Tajikistan, Kazakstan and Uzbekistan.
The visit to Central Asia is being made at the request of Vice President Gore, Mr. Richardson said. Diplomats here are speculating that Mr. Richardson, a former Democratic Congressman for New Mexico, may be positioning himself to become Mr. Gore's running mate in the next Presidential election.
"Vice President Gore requested that I journey to Central Asia to enhance our bilateral ties as well as demonstrate support for these nations," Mr. Richardson said, uncharacteristically reading from a prepared statement.
He said topics he would discuss with Central Asian leaders include regional trade and security, the environment and the continuing war in Afghanistan, where the United Nations is attempting to start talks between the Islamic Taliban movement, which controls most of the country, and the forces of the government it ousted, which are now pressing toward Kabul, the capital, from the north. Secretary General Kofi Annan is sending a new troubleshooter, Lakhdar Brahimi, a former foreign minister of Algeria, to the region this week to assess the situation.
Mr. Richardson said today that the compromise plan the Clinton Administration negotiated with Congress that would allow the United States to begin paying its United Nations dues was still open to some adjustment. The plan is stalled because of efforts in the House of Representatives to link it to a cutoff of all aid to countries or organizations that support abortion as a form of birth control.
But even before this hurdle appeared, the agreement was creating problems for American diplomats here because Congress had been demanding closer American oversight of the United Nations, its budget and its operations.

HEADLINE: Consumer Credit Growth Stalls As Demand for Car Loans Drops

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 7

 BODY:
Borrowing by American consumers unexpectedly stalled in June, as demand for auto financing and other personal loans declined. It was the first month without an increase in consumer borrowing in more than four years.
The level of outstanding consumer credit was unchanged at $1.217 trillion after rising by a revised $2.5 billion in May, the Federal Reserve said today. Previously, the Fed had said that it rose by $3.0 billion in May. Analysts had expected an increase of $5.0 billion during June. 
 "Consumers and the suppliers of credit have grown a little more wary" of borrowing and lending money, Cynthia Latta, an economist at DRI/McGraw-Hill in Lexington, Mass., said. Delinquent loans sent personal bankruptcies above the one million mark in 1996, a yearly record. In some cases, banks are no longer providing credit to tardy borrowers, Ms. Latta said.
Analysts watch the Fed's consumer credit report because it helps them gauge consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of overall economic activity. June's reading was the weakest since a decline of $700 million in May 1993, according to the Fed's statistics.
By category in June, revolving loans, which include credit cards, increased by $2.5 billion, auto loans fell by $100 million, and other types of installment loans fell by $2.4 billion. The Fed's report does not track loans secured by real estate, such as home equity loans and mortgages.
In a separate report, the Labor Department said yesterday that initial claims for unemployment benefits had risen last week, though they were rebounding from the lowest level in more than 23 years. Claims increased by 25,000, to a seasonally adjusted 300,000. In the previous week, claims fell by a revised 24,000, to 275,000, initially reported as a 22,000 drop, to 277,000.
The four-week average for new claims fell to 303,750, from 325,250 the previous week. That was the lowest level for the four-week average since a reading of 302,500 in the last week of February 1989.

HEADLINE: Brest, French Home Port, Sees Future of Mothballs

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY

DATELINE: BREST, France

 BODY:
Cardinal Richelieu selected this city at the tip of Brittany to give France a first-class navy. He succeeded so well that over 360 years later, one out of every two jobs here now depends on the military.
Brest, which was heavily bombed during World War II in an Allied effort to destroy the huge submarine base built by the Germans, has been rebuilt since the war. Nowadays, it worries about its 13 percent unemployment rate, one that threatens to get even worse because of military spending cutbacks planned over the next five years. 
 With budget cuts and spending freezes part of the order of the day for the new Socialist Government of Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, just as they were for the conservatives who began a top-to-bottom post-cold war restructuring of the French military last year, the director of the giant French naval shipyard that dominates the port here warns that the future will not be easy.
"We're headed towards a difficult period, so we're trying to diversify into offshore drilling rigs," the director, Louis Petitbois, said. The yard's biggest military construction project, the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle, is now nearing completion at the main pier beside its two biggest drydocks.
"We know it won't be easy, but we're doing our best to adapt," he said.
Construction or repair of giant floating oil-drilling rigs for the civilian oil industry would be a step in a new direction for the Brest Navy Yard, which now employs 5,500 local civilians compared with 6,800 five years ago.
"We're accelerating staff reductions in anticipation of a slowdown because of cutbacks in the military budget that Parliament decided on last year," Mr. Petitbois said.
He and most of the rest of the 220,000 people who live here are still waiting to hear the details of what the new Government has in mind for Brest.
But Bertrand Laot, a technician who headed the Democratic French Labor Confederation office here until this summer, thinks he knows which way the wind is blowing, since one of Mr. Jospin's first actions after taking office on June 1 was a preliminary freeze of $333 million in spending on military projects.
"Cutbacks have been continuous for the past five years no matter what the Prime Minister's name was," he said.
France's conservative President, Jacques Chirac, ordered a restructuring of the French military that will do away with conscription by 2002 and reduce the size of the military to 350,000 from 500,000 a year ago.
Brest, whose shopping streets tend toward chain department stores and American fast food outlets rather than to boutiques and expense-account restaurants, threw most of its conservative legislators out and replaced them with Socialists in the elections in the spring. But the tide continued to run against the military industry the town has always depended on.
The French Navy not only designs its own ships and submarines, as the United States Navy does, but also builds them itself instead of contracting with private builders. The Brest shipyard is wholly owned by the French military procurement agency, itself a vast establishment now in the throes of restructuring.
"They've reduced the size of the labor force by delegating a lot of jobs they used to do out to subcontractors, but it's clear that there's going to be a major reduction in shipbuilding orders and probably 3,000 jobs will be lost by the year 2000," Mr. Laot said. "We've been telling them since the 1980's that they should have gotten started earlier on diversification."
His and other unions here led a demonstration of 30,000 people last year and got another 15,000 to 20,000 people into the streets at the beginning of this year to protest the cutbacks. But with unemployment in Brest already running above the 12.6 percent national average, Mr. Laot conceded that there was little prospect of a turnabout.
"So far this year, the shipyard has hired only 19 apprentices," he said, shaking his head. "In the 1980's, they always took on 90 to 100 a year. The future looks pretty dark."
Mothballing rather than making ships threatens to become Brest's major industry. The Durance, an 18,000-ton resupply ship that visited New York City at the beginning of July, was decommissioned when it got back here at the end of the month. It will be cannibalized for spare parts for other ships of its class, a shipyard official said.
Most of the work on the $2.8 billion Charles de Gaulle, an 858-foot-long, 44,000-ton nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, is to be completed by the end of this year, nearly 10 years after the keel was laid. Jacques Bizcen, the shipyard official in charge of the project, said construction could have been completed faster but for previous Government budget cuts.
"There have been three and a half years of postponements to save money," said Capt. Richard Wilmot-Roussel, the carrier's military commander, acknowledging that the delays were false economies that had been imposed on the shipyard by budget snarls in Paris.
Captain Wilmot-Roussel is already on board, like about two-thirds of his crew of 1,250, who expect to bring the ship into full active duty in mid-1999.
Right now the carrier is cluttered with scaffolding, power cables and carpentry and painting equipment, but the forward flight deck was clear the other day for tests of one of its two American-designed steam-powered airplane catapults.
With a big thud and a trail of steam shooting across the deck like smoke from a powder fuse, the catapult launched a dead weight as massive as the supersonic Rafale fighter-bombers it will have to handle off the ship's bow at more than 150 miles an hour, making a splash as big as a bomb in the harbor.
"France's means are too modest to permit it to build a large carrier like the U.S.S. Nimitz class," the captain said. "But with the Charles de Gaulle we will have the same unlimited range and force-projection capabilities as an American nuclear-powered carrier with F-18's. We'll just carry half as many of them."
A smaller force packing a larger punch, and capable of moving troops and weapons systems far from home, is what Mr. Chirac hopes will emerge from the restructuring. But in the short run it's not good news for Brest. With no sister ship for the De Gaulle currently planned, the main source of work for Brest's shipbuilders for the rest of the decade is an amphibious assault ship called the Siroco.
"I often get calls from people asking if I think their kids should go to work at the yard," said Jean Tanguy Leost, another union official. "I tell them, if their children are doing well in school, they should keep on with their studies."

For Stock Mutual Funds in '97, A Great Year in Just 7 Months

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

 BODY:
Seven months into the year, mutual fund investors have already made this the second-best year ever for stock funds. Nor have they forgotten about bonds in their rush to buy stocks; bond funds have already recorded their best year since 1993.
The Investment Company Institute, a mutual fund trade group, said yesterday that equity funds took in an estimated $23 billion in new cash in July. If the estimate is confirmed in the institute's final figures at the end of this month, it would be the fifth-largest monthly total and the biggest since January, when stock funds received a monthly record of $29 billion in new money. 
 So far this year, investors have deposited a net $133 billion in stock mutual funds, more than in any whole year except 1996, when these funds took in $221 billion in net new cash.
Bond funds in July received an estimated $4 billion in net cash flows, the best monthly total since January 1996. Including last month's deposits, bond funds have taken in $13.2 billion in the first seven months of the year, exceeding the $12.8 billion received by bond funds in all of 1996.
Bond funds suffered substantial outflows beginning in 1994, when the Federal Reserve pushed up interest rates, leading to a rout in the bond market. Investors withdrew a net $43.3 billion from bond funds in 1994 and took out $4.7 billion more in 1995.
The best year ever for bond funds was 1993, when they took in $113 billion.
In nine of the last 12 months, however, investors have added to their bond fund investments. Those additions took a sharp jump last month, as the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond dipped to its lowest level since February 1996. (Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions)
That mutual fund investors have responded with such enthusiasm to a steady increase in stock and bond prices over the last four months gives some professionals pause, however.
"As long as prices are going up, people tend to feel good," said Robert W. Bissell, a senior vice president at Wells Fargo Investment Management, the mutual fund unit of the California-based banking company. "My reaction is to be a little more careful when everything seems bright and rosy."
With both stock and bond prices significantly higher than at the beginning of the year, Mr. Bissell said, "you've got to assume that any serious bad news is going to scare people."
Not that he sees any real clouds on the horizon. Mr. Bissell said that earlier this week, he tried to list all the reasons that stocks have performed so well this year. "I think I got to about 25" items on the list, he said.
That gave him confidence that cash flows are far from the only factor propelling the stock market. In fact, Mr. Bissell said, he believes the monthly data are a lagging indicator of market sentiment, rather than a leading one.
For most of the mutual fund companies, however, the recent cash-flow figures confirm that business has rarely been better.
The Vanguard Group, the country's second-largest mutual fund company after Fidelity Investments and the biggest seller of index funds, one of the most popular types of stock funds lately, recorded its second-best month of the year for stock fund sales in July, behind only January.
Ditto at Fidelity, a unit of the FMR Corporation, where stock fund inflows also trailed only January.
July's estimated net inflows to stock funds were up 39 percent, from $16.5 billion in June, and were four times the $5.7 billion recorded a year earlier, in July 1996. That month, stock prices fell sharply, causing stock fund inflows to all but cease.
Flows into bond funds, which totaled $2.1 billion in June, nearly doubled last month. In July 1996, bond funds suffered a net outflow of $1 billion.

HEADLINE: Welfare Bill Denies Benefits To Immigrants in First Year

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ

DATELINE: ALBANY, Aug. 7

 BODY:
The welfare bill awaiting Gov. George E. Pataki's signature contains a provision that would deny state-financed benefits to legal immigrants in their first year in this country. Immigrants are allowed to enter the country only if sponsors promise financial support, but New York State now provides benefits to immigrants when sponsors are unable or unwilling to support them.
The welfare bill, which the Governor is expected to approve in the next few days, would end that practice for immigrants in their first year in America. Pataki administration officials, defending the provision, noted that the sponsorship requirement in Federal immigration law made newcomers the responsibility of their sponsors and the Federal Government, not state taxpayers. 
 Beyond that, administration officials said, it is necessary to adopt the 12-month restriction on benefits for newcomers so that the state avoids becoming a magnet for poor people from beyond its borders.
"When people are granted the right to be a legal noncitizen resident, they're expected to be self-sufficient," said Daniel D. Hogan, a spokesman for the state's Department of Social Services. "But if you come to be a ward of the state, no, that's not a reason to come in. That's not a reason to be a resident."
The provision has begun to draw fire from groups that advocate benefits for the poor and immigrants. They said they were surprised and dismayed to find the new restriction buried in the 200-page state welfare bill, particularly since Mr. Pataki had expressed a desire to establish more generous state-financed benefits for immigrants denied Federal assistance under a law enacted last year. That law denies federally financed benefits to immigrants arriving in this country after August 1996.
The advocates also contend that the one-year ban on state-financed benefits might violate the New York State Constitution declaration that state and local governments have an obligation to care for the needy.
"We were shocked by this," said Marjorie McHugh, executive director of the New York Immigration Coalition, whose 175 groups represent immigrants and refugees. "This is a tremendous change in both the Governor's position, as well as state policy. It is an ill-conceived 11th-hour provision that was inserted into the law without any consideration of its necessity or impact on people."
The advocates also questioned what the state would gain by excluding this group, given that it is relatively small.
Between 100,000 and 125,000 legal immigrants come to New York State every year, according to the coalition. Welfare experts say that 5 percent require public assistance. The advocates say that people who might need public aid, particularly mothers and their children, could be left with no means of financial support if their sponsor, often a male head of household, abandons them, becomes unemployed or fails to live up to his commitment for another reason.
"The concern is that there won't be a safety net if these people lose their sponsor," said Shelly Nortz, director of state policy for New York State Coalition for the Homeless. "The policy has heretofore been to provide assistance if no sponsor is available."
Throughout the debate over reforming the state's welfare laws, Mr. Pataki has cast himself as a defender of immigrants, saying that those here legally should not be deprived of public assistance.
As recently as last week, after Mr. Pataki and legislative leaders reached a deal on changing the state's welfare laws, his office issued a news release that said simply, "Legal immigrants will receive non-cash safety-net benefits with a personal-needs allowance in year one."
Zenia Mucha, the Governor's director of communications, said today that the administration only intended to give benefits to needy immigrants already in the country.
"We're talking about legal immigrants who are here," she said. "They have a right to be protected."
The welfare bill passed by the Legislature this week would continue providing state-financed benefits for immigrants already in this country.
The immigrants would be able to get cash benefits for up to two years and then a combination of vouchers and some cash for as long as they stay on welfare. Lawmakers have said that this program is crucial for immigrants who do not qualify for Federal assistance. But newly arriving immigrants, the Pataki administration said, come under the promise that they will not depend on state aid and thus must live up to that commitment.

HEADLINE: In Balanced-Budget Deal, Bush Is Off the Seesaw

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 7

 BODY:
While President Clinton and Speaker Newt Gingrich are grandly congratulating themselves and each other over the balanced-budget deal they wrought, George Bush, the man who risked the most and paid the biggest price for cutting the deficit, is off in Maine, feeling unappreciated.
"I'm a great believer in letting history decide what you did right and what you did wrong," the former President said in a telephone interview today. 
 "I do think history will show that we laid the groundwork for some of this," Mr. Bush said. "It would please me if that was recognized, because I was derided as being out of touch and having no feel for the economy."
Mr. Bush did not say so, but among those who derided him that way were Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gingrich. The former President agreed to be interviewed on the condition that he not appear to be tooting his own horn.
The budget agreement that Mr. Bush struck in 1990 with a Congress controlled by Democrats may well have cost him his Presidency. Many of his fellow Republican politicians turned against him because as part of the budget agreement, he abandoned the promise he made in his 1988 campaign: "Read my lips, no new taxes."
In the 1992 race, Mr. Clinton advocated a tax cut and portrayed Mr. Bush as inept on economic matters. But the prevailing view of economists is that the 1990 deal was the single most important political step leading to a balanced budget.
"The major heavy lifting was done by George Bush and the 101st Congress," said Robert D. Reischauer, who was then the director of the Congressional Budget Office and is now an economist at the Brookings Institution.
"This package is not primarily about deficit reduction," Mr. Reischauer said, speaking of this year's budget legislation. "It's more about delivering on the promises of the Republicans to cut taxes and of the President to expand spending on certain programs."
At his news conference on Wednesday, Mr. Clinton allotted no credit to Mr. Bush's heavy lifting. "The first step" toward eliminating annual budget deficits, the President said, "was taken back in 1993 when we opened a new chapter in fiscal responsibility."
If that galled Mr. Bush, he did not let on in the interview.
"He's very content with himself, and he's much too much of a gentleman to pat himself on the back," said Nicholas F. Brady, who was Mr. Bush's Treasury Secretary and is still a close friend.
But Mr. Clinton's claim of originality "is just plain wrong," Mr. Brady continued. "It started with George Bush. He's the guy who lay down on the railroad tracks."
In these times of peace and prosperity, it is easy to forget the tensions that dominated politics in the fall of 1990. Iraq had just invaded Kuwait. The economy was in a recession. The budget deficit was approaching $300 billion and rising.
To break a deadlock with the Democratic Congress, the White House issued a statement saying that "tax revenue increases" would be a part of the budget negotiations. Standing before television cameras in the White House driveway, Mr. Gingrich, then the No. 2 Republican in the House, denounced the President.
After weeks of negotiations, Mr. Bush and Democratic Congressional leaders reached an agreement on the budget.With little support from the Democratic rank and file and with Mr. Gingrich organizing the Republican opposition, the agreement was voted down by the House. A new accord was annealed. Much more favorable to Democrats, it was approved in Congress even though a large majority of Republicans voted "no."
The tax increases are what is most remembered about the measure. The tax rate on the income of the wealthiest Americans was raised to 31 percent from 28 percent, and they were forced to pay more in Medicare premiums. The value of deductions and personal exemptions was phased out for upper-income taxpayers. Taxes on gasoline and cigarettes were raised.
But in retrospect, economists say, the most important element of the accord was the discipline it placed on Government spending.
Annual outlays for what is known as discretionary spending -- everything from aircraft carriers to computer paper -- were essentially frozen. No new spending on benefit programs like Medicare was allowed unless it was offset by a tax increase, and no tax cut was permitted unless it was offset by a cut in benefit programs. And an accounting loophole was closed that had allowed the Government to borrow money and not count it as spending.
Those rules were extended by Mr. Clinton's budget in 1993, and they basically remain in place today.
Mr. Reischauer has calculated that the five-year savings from the 1990 deal was $580 billion in 1997 dollars. The comparable figure in the 1993 budget was $474 billion. And the projected saving from this year's measure is $125 billion.
One reason Mr. Bush may not get credit for what he accomplished in deficit reduction is that he began apologizing even before he signed the legislation. On the day Congress voted its final approval, he said he was "absolutely going to hold the line on taxes" from then on. And in his 1992 campaign, he seemed to suggest that the deal might have been a mistake.
Today, his tune is changed somewhat. "I'm not particularly proud of the tax increase," he said at his summer home in Kennebunkport as his house guest, Brian Mulroney, the former Prime Minister of Canada, listened in to the interview. "But we had to have some compromise, and I paid one hell of a price for it."

HEADLINE: A Makeover May Change More Than Columbia

BYLINE: By KURT EICHENWALD

 BODY:
Adopting drastic changes in the way it does business, the Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corporation has begun transforming itself into a company far different from the one that upended the once-sleepy hospital world over the last nine years.
Gone -- apparently -- is the obsession with 15 percent profit growth each year that at times may have led managers to actions that prompted a sweeping criminal investigation. Gone is the seemingly insatiable appetite for acquiring competing hospitals that has made Columbia one of the most feared participants in the health care industry. And gone is the once unshakable faith that to succeed in the modern health care system, a company must own businesses that provide every phase of treatment, from hospital care to home care. 
 Columbia's plan to alter or abandon many of its controversial business practices was announced yesterday. Elements of the plan, first disclosed yesterday in The New York Times, include selling the company's home health care division, eliminating its cash bonus program for executives who met financial targets, adopting new rules to insure employees comply with the law and abandoning the practice of selling interests in Columbia hospitals to doctors, as well as other changes.
The effects of Columbia's changes could well reach beyond just this one company to other parts of the health care industry. Indeed, analysts who just a short time ago believed that the future of American health care rested with a small number of large health care systems have found their faith shaken by the makeover at Columbia.
"Six months ago I thought I had a handle on where we would be in health care several years down the road," said Leo Murphy, vice president of investments at Pioneer Management, a Columbia investor. But with Columbia taking a step back, he said: "I think now we are going to be surprised where we are going to come out. It's not going to be what we thought."
Executives working with Columbia said that while many elements of the plan had been in place for several days the final version remained in flux until shortly before yesterday's announcement. Late Wednesday night, at meetings in the company's headquarters in Nashville, senior executives hammered out last-minute additions in the action plan, an effort to respond to wide-ranging criminal investigations of the company.
Under the additional points, the company would adopt stronger guidelines on any future transactions with doctors, to insure that they avoid the appearance of conflicts of interest. It will adopt stricter guidelines and controls in billing for laboratory services, which is one element of the multifaceted fraud investigation of Columbia.
The company will also begin reviews of what is known as Medicare coding. Under Federal rules, Medicare pays a set amount for each of thousands of specified diagnoses. Through what is known as upcoding, hospitals can increase their revenue by reporting that the diagnosis was more severe than what was actually treated. To insure against that and to avoid mistakes, Columbia will create a two-step review process, including analysis by independent auditors, for specific codes that are particularly susceptible to coding errors.
After examining information developed by The Times in the course of a yearlong investigation into Columbia's business practices, the Federal agency that runs Medicare began a review to determine if certain Columbia hospitals engaged in upcoding.
A computer analysis of more than 30 million billing records by The Times, first reported in March, found that Columbia hospitals billed Medicare for high-paying respiratory treatments far more often than did competing hospitals serving similar populations. Federal authorities called such findings an indication of possible overbilling of the program.
Columbia's plan was announced less than two weeks after the appointment of Dr. Thomas F. Frist Jr. as chairman and chief executive of the embattled company. He replaced Richard L. Scott, the hard-driving co-founder who pushed the company and its employees to meet a series of aggressive financial targets.
In a conference call with reporters yesterday morning, Dr. Frist, the co-founder and former chairman of the Hospital Corporation of America, made clear that the initiatives marked a drastic shift in Columbia's strategy, which had propelled the company to the top of the health care world while raising questions about the legality of some of its actions.
"This is a definite change in emphasis from rapid growth to operational mode for the next 18 to 24 months," he said. Saying that the "meteoric pace" of growth at the company was no longer appropriate, Dr. Frist said it was time for Columbia to "take a pause, a deep breath."
Dr. Frist also made clear that by deciding to sell its home health care division, the company was moving away from Mr. Scott's faith that the future of health care was in full-service health care systems that owned every outlet for the delivery of care. Such integration could be accomplished instead through ventures with other companies.
"This isn't abandoning the fully integrated health care system," Dr. Frist said. "The difference is, it doesn't all have to be owned."
Dr. Frist also said that Columbia would drop its adversarial approach to not-for-profit hospitals, and instead reach out to them, both for advice and for cooperative ventures.
But by disposing of its home health care division while removing pressures for executives to meet financial targets, Columbia will not achieve the earnings performance it has in the past, analysts said.
"This is all going to moderate their growth rate," Mr. Murphy of Pioneer said. "The management has accepted that, and I think Wall Street is starting to get there."
As the plan was coming into focus, in recent weeks some analysts began trimming their estimates for profit growth, from around 15 percent to about 10 percent. But, given the increasing pressure of the Federal investigations, securities analysts supported the company's moves.
Falling earnings "is not the critical issue facing the company," Kenneth Abramowitz, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, said. "The critical issue is to resolve these disputes and investigations."
The same could hold true for Columbia's rivals. Many emulated the company's practices and now fear that they too could be caught up in scandal. In the end, that could save money for Federal payment systems like Medicare, as efforts to clean up billing errors and improprieties sweep across the industry.
"There is considerable concern that the investigative probes that have penetrated so deeply into Columbia will next focus on not-for-profit targets," said John Leifer, an independent health care consultant who resigned as a senior vice president at Columbia over concern about its business practices. Because of that, "the vast majority of hospitals and health systems will re-evaluate the manner in which they do business to insure that their activities can withstand scrutiny."
But the changes in the industry could reach further. In particular, with Columbia declaring its intent to sharply slow the pace of acquisitions and become more cooperative with competitors, the number of large -- and sometimes ill-planned -- health care deals could drop, some health care experts said.
"The threat of Columbia was like the Vikings coming on the coast of France, and people made very rash decisions in response," said Uwe Reinhardt, a health care economist at Princeton University. "So a lot of the irrational integration and dealmaking that wasn't well thought out might diminish."

F.C.C. Moves to Cut Costs Of Phone Calls Overseas
The F.C.C. issued tough new rules to reduce the payments that American telephone companies make to foreign carriers to complete their calls.
 
 The move could sharply reduce the cost of calling from the United States to many places overseas. But it represents the Government's first aggressive entry into the back-room haggling among the world's telephone companies, which questioned the F.C.C.'s jurisdiction. [Page A1.]
 
Strong Month for Retailers
American retailers in July enjoyed one of the strongest months of sales in two years. The Goldman, Sachs retail composite index rose 5.7 percent. [D6.]
 
In the previous month, however, growth in consumer credit slowed, as demand for auto financing and other loans declined. [D4.]
 
Gains in Operations At America Online
America Online, the computer on-line service, posted a quarterly loss, though Stephen M. Case, the company's chairman, noted that operating results were above analysts' expectations. The company also restated its results for previous quarters after the S.E.C. refused to approve its accounting procedures. [D3.]
 
Mixing New York and Hollywood
CBS elevated Leslie Moonves, the network's top programming executive, to president of CBS Television, giving him considerable oversight over the business side, too. [D4.]
 
Bonds Slump, Hurting Stocks
Treasury securities stumbled as an auction of 30-year bonds was a bit disappointing and as a surge of corporate debt came to market. In trading, the 30-year bond's yield rose to 6.52 percent from 6.47, through the newly auctioned issue was awarded at 6.44 percent. [D16.]
 
The weakness in the Treasury market hurt stocks, too, with the Dow industrials falling 71.31 points, to 8,188.00, in a topsy-turvy session. [D6.]
 
Agriculture Investment by DuPont
DuPont said that it would invest $1.7 billion in Pioneer Hi-Bred International, a seed producer, as part of a plan to create a powerful rival to Monsanto and others in the fast-growing business of genetically engineered agriculture. [D3.]
 
Fisher Scientific Finds Buyer
An investor group led by the Thomas H. Lee Companies agreed to buy Fisher Scientific for $1.4 billion, in an effort to thwart an unsolicited offer of $1 billion by the Bass Group. [D3.]
 
Kodak Digital Unit's Head Is Out
The president of Kodak's troubled digital imaging business resigned after struggling for a year and a half to get it on track. [D3.]
 
Tougher Times for E.D.S.
Electronic Data Systems, buffeted by tougher competition and shrinking profit margins in the computer services industry, reported declining earnings and said the poor results would continue for the rest of the year. [D6.]
 
Crackdown on Fleet-Footed Brokers
The N.A.S.D. adopted a rule that will make it much harder for brokers from firms that violate securities laws to move on to other firms after theirs have been shut down. [D3.]
 
G.E. Cuts Stake in Paine Webber
General Electric's Capital Services agreed to sell six million Paine Webber shares back to the brokerage firm for $219 million. [D4.]
 
Little Progress Seen in U.P.S. Talks
Leaders of the teamsters' union and the United Parcel Service resumed negotiations in an effort to end the four-day-old strike, but their public statements indicated little flexibility from either side. [A22.]
 
In 1982, recently hired part-timers at U.P.S. earned $9 an hour, $4 less than a full-timer. Today, the part-timers still earn $9 an hour while full-timers earn nearly $20 -- indicative of how the country has increasingly moved to two tiers of jobs and wages. [A22.]

HEADLINE: CALLING OVERSEAS MAY GET CHEAPER

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

 BODY:
In a move that could sharply reduce the cost of calling from the United States to many places overseas, the Federal Communications Commission issued tough new rules yesterday to cut the $5.4 billion that American telephone companies pay to foreign carriers to complete their calls.
The rules represent the Government's first aggressive entry into the back-room haggling among the world's telephone companies. They are intended to jump-start competition in global telecommunications and stanch the flow of dollars from American to foreign carriers. But they may have their biggest impact on the average customer's phone bill. 
 Reed E. Hundt, the chairman of the F.C.C., said yesterday that the rules would help reduce the average cost of an overseas call to 20 cents a minute from 88 cents a minute over six years.
"We are a nation of immigrants, and we ought to be able to phone home without being E.T.," Mr. Hundt said, referring to Steven Spielberg's extraterrestrial, who did not need to make expensive calls to reach the folks back home.
The F.C.C.'s unilateral move drew harsh criticism from representatives of foreign carriers, who said the United States could not impose rates on foreign carriers and predicted that some carriers might refuse to accept the commission's rates. They also questioned the F.C.C.'s jurisdiction, saying that the plan violated a recent global communications deal negotiated at the World Trade Organization.
"This is going to antagonize foreign carriers," said Albert Halprin, a former F.C.C. official and now a communications lawyer who has lobbied on behalf of New Zealand's national carrier, Telecom New Zealand. "Instead of trying to lead a global effort to reform the system, the F.C.C. has chosen to make itself the champion for U.S. carriers."
Mr. Hundt said the commission took its action after five years of failed efforts to marshal support among other countries to revamp the Byzantine system of payments between phone companies. He predicted that the foreign carriers would have little ground to retaliate.
"There has been a consensus for a decade that a cartel of companies has jacked up prices to a hideous level," he said.
At the heart of the F.C.C.'s campaign are fees called settlement rates. These are the payments that phone companies make to each other to complete calls. Settlement rates have historically been set well above the cost of completing a call, particularly in countries with less developed economies or powerful state-owned telephone monopolies.
Settlement rates can account for much more than half the total cost of an overseas call -- which is why it is so much more expensive to call Sao Paulo than San Francisco from New York. According to the F.C.C., the average cost of a domestic long-distance call is 13 cents a minute, compared with 88 cents a minute for an overseas call.
Because AT&T and other American carriers send more calls overseas than they receive, the settlement system results in a net outflow of money from the United States to foreign carriers. Reducing the settlement rates would not wipe out the imbalance. But F.C.C. officials said it could trim the $5.4 billion deficit to less than $2 billion.
The United States Government has not historically played a large role in establishing settlement rates; they were usually hammered out in private negotiations between the carriers. But because most foreign phone companies are state-owned or controlled, the American carriers were, in effect, negotiating with the governments of these countries.
Under the new rules, however, the F.C.C. would direct AT&T and other American carriers to negotiate deals with foreign carriers, based on benchmark rates tailored to the income level of their home countries. The rates range from 15 cents a minute for wealthy countries like Britain to 23 cents a minute for poor countries like Bangladesh. Countries in between, like Mexico and the Philippines, would have rates set at 19 cents.
The plan will have little effect on highly competitive overseas routes, like New York-London. The rates charged by British Telecommunications, for example, are already below the F.C.C. benchmark. But it will have a huge effect on a market like the Philippines, which currently has a settlement rate of 50 cents a minute and under the commission's new rules would have to cut it to 19 cents a minute.
The overall plan would take effect on Jan. 1, 1998, and is timed to coincide with the World Trade Organization agreement, which will open 95 percent of the world's telephone markets to competition. But the actual rates will be phased in over five years, with the wealthy countries having to comply by 1999 while the poorest countries have until 2003.
Because two-thirds of the world's overseas telephone traffic travels between Europe and North America, Mr. Hundt said the majority of consumers would see a measurable decline in rates within two years. But it is uncertain precisely how much of a decline in customer rates will come in the first years of the plan.
Mr. Hundt has already signaled his get-tough approach. He recently informed MCI Communications that the commission would reject a deal between it and the national carrier of India because the rates were too high. And he expressed displeasure with a pending deal between AT&T and Japan.
If the foreign carriers balk at lower rates, Mr. Hundt said the United States had several cudgels. The F.C.C. could order every American carrier to demand the same rate, which would ratchet up the pressure on a country to come to terms.
Last year, AT&T won the support of the commission for such a strategy when it tried to reduce the rates it was paying to the dominant Argentine carrier, Telefonica de Argentina.
When Telefonica de Argentina would not accede to AT&T's proposed rates and began refusing to complete its calls, the commission ordered other American carriers to begin paying the same rate as AT&T. That pressure brought Telefonica de Argentina to terms with AT&T.
If a country were to cut off its circuits to the United States altogether, F.C.C. officials said there was still another option. American carriers could route calls through a third country, and that country's national carrier could pass them on to the hostile country.
The prospect of a go-between siphoning off the settlement fees from calls intended for a country would be enough of an incentive for that country to come to an agreement, F.C.C. officials said.
Still, some industry experts were uncertain that the F.C.C.'s tactics would work, particularly in less-developed countries, which have come to rely on settlement fees to finance public works projects.
"Why would they give that up without a fight?" said Brian Moir, a lobbyist for the International Communications Association, which represents more than 500 multinational corporate telephone customers.
And Mr. Halprin pointed out that the immediate beneficiaries of the lower settlement rates would be the carriers -- not their customers. He said the F.C.C. had not mandated that AT&T, MCI and other carriers pass along their savings to customers on a dollar-for-dollar basis.
"They make a phenomenally high rate of return on their international service," Mr. Halprin said. "This is primarily in the interest of AT&T and other American carriers."
But Peter Cowhey, the chief of the F.C.C.'s international bureau, said the coming competition in long distance would make it untenable for carriers not to pass along the savings to customers.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "Ringing Up Charges"
When an international call is placed, the caller pays the company on whose lines the call originated; the phone company on the receiving end gets nothing from the caller, though it bears much of the cost of completing the call. To compensate for this, settlement ratesare paid by the originating company -- usually American, since most international calls originate in the United States -- to the receiving company. Here are settlement rates for places Americans call most.

HEADLINE: Landmark Settlement Ends Hispanic Housing Bias Suit

BYLINE: By PAM BELLUCK

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Aug. 7

 BODY:
When a job in the press room of a printing company lured Francisco Hernandez to Addison, Ill., a dozen years ago, he was one of only a few Mexican-Americans in town.
The Chicago suburb, where boxy factories as flat as the land churn out gaskets and garage doors, conveyor belts and plastic bubble wrap, had long been a destination of the city's middle-class whites, many from an earlier kind of American immigrant stock: Greek, Italian, Polish or German. 
 But Mr. Hernandez was soon joined by other working-class Mexican-Americans, who abandoned Chicago's grit and strain for Addison's safe streets, humming economy and solid schools. By 1990, they made up more than an eighth of Addison's 32,000 residents.
Then, three years ago, the local government bulldozed the small apartment building where Mr. Hernandez lived. It also razed seven other buildings and condemned three more in Mr. Hernandez's neighborhood, saying those and dozens of other buildings containing several hundred apartments were blighted.
The Hispanic residents said Addison was trying to force them out of town, or at least discourage more from coming. The Justice Department agreed and sued, accusing Addison of intentional discrimination.
Today, Addison officials settled the Federal case and a private class-action lawsuit with an ambitious plan that Justice Department officials and housing experts said was a watershed resolution to a housing discrimination claim: While denying that it intentionally discriminated, the village will agree to build affordable housing to replace what it tears down, pay moving costs or compensation to dozens of families, deposit $30,000 in a fair housing fund and put up a community center and parks in the two Hispanic neighborhoods.
The plan is expected to cost $20 million to $25 million, most of it in development costs, Addison officials said. The cost of damages to families and fair-housing groups alone, up to $1.4 million, makes the settlement one of the largest by a municipality in a fair-housing suit, said Paul Hancock, acting deputy United States Attorney General for civil rights.
The case, Justice and housing officials say, is also the latest example of a recent and troubling trend in which Hispanic residents have become the target of a kind of bias that blacks once faced, with several municipalities in New Mexico, New Jersey and elsewhere in the country using government programs or zoning laws as discriminatory tools.
Hispanic Americans, now 10 percent of the United States population and expected to become the country's largest minority by 2010, are beginning to leave overcrowded urban neighborhoods for better jobs in the suburbs, many of which have long been dominated by whites.
"A lot of these jurisdictions for the first time are experiencing an increase in Hispanic population," Mr. Hancock said. "In previous decades we dealt with opposition to racial minorities moving to the suburbs. This seems to be similar."
In Addison, Mr. Hancock said, "our concern was not just that they were tearing down housing, but that their intent seemed to be to rid the village of Hispanics. Now with this plan they are improving the sections of the village where Hispanics live and everyone will be able to stay in the village. That's what makes this such an important settlement."
Municipal officials said they were not biased, but were trying to address concerns about overcrowded housing and dilapidated apartments. Some said that if the Hispanic residents were affected by the ordinances, it was because their families tended to be larger, sometimes including several relatives beyond the immediate family, or because they lived in neighborhoods where the houses were more run-down.
Addison officials denied any discriminatory intent in their decision to use a state tax incentive program to demolish some buildings and make way for new development. John Berley, the assistant village manager, said officials settled the case to avoid the cost of continuing legal proceedings and the risk of losing at trial.
Mr. Berley suggested that the village, a Republican stronghold, might have been the focus of a political agenda by a Democratic Administration in Washington. And he said that much of the settlement, including the new parks and community center, was "a plan we probably would have done anyway."
Hispanic residents and advocates say there is more to it. They say that Hispanic Americans encounter friction after their neighborhoods swell and their culture and language begin to be noticed.
"People hear Spanish being spoken in the street and at school," said Jonathan Rothstein, a lawyer who represented the plaintiffs in the class-action suit against Addison. "They see Latinos using their front yards instead of their back yards. It reaches what some people consider an unacceptable critical mass."
Charles Kamasaki, a vice president of the National Council of La Raza, said that Hispanic residents long unwilling or insufficiently savvy to file civil rights complaints were becoming better organized and more aggressive.
Mr. Hancock said the Addison settlement, which still must be approved by the Federal district judge handling the case, went far beyond what could have been achieved at trial and "the city deserves credit for sitting down and working out a solution."
In the last three years, three other towns have reached settlements with the Justice Department in housing discrimination cases against Hispanic residents.
In New Jersey, the beach town of Wildwood, near Atlantic City, agreed to pay $75,000 in damages after the Justice Department accused the city of discrimination against Hispanic families by selectively enforcing an ordinance that allowed only one person to a bedroom.
The City of Hatch, N.M., settled a lawsuit brought by the Justice Department in December by agreeing to pay $260,000. The suit said town officials used a ban on mobile homes to force Mexican farm workers to move out of Hatch and live in "colonias," squalid shacks without sewage systems or potable water.
Another Chicago suburb, Waukegan, agreed in May to pay up to $200,000 in damages, hire a bilingual fair-housing counselor and stop enforcing a housing ordinance that limited the number of people who could live under one roof to the immediate family and two additional relatives.
And Cicero, Ill., a historically white town west of Chicago, is also being sued for what the Justice Department said was a similar restriction on occupancy that not only seemed to target the town's rapidly growing Hispanic population but also angered real estate agents who said the ordinance kept them from selling houses to the many Hispanic families moving in.
A spokesman for Cicero, David Donahue, denied the allegations and said the town had no intention of settling the lawsuit. "If you have two families living in a single-family home," Mr. Donahue said, "they are only paying one set of property taxes. It's a safety reason and a school overcrowding issue."
Fair-housing advocates and Hispanic organizations said that the Justice Department was selective about the cases it chose and that they had seen similar examples of housing discrimination in Minnesota, Texas and other states.
In the Chicago area, where housing advocates have a long tradition and Hispanic immigration has risen sharply, several suburbs have been confronted about their housing plans or zoning laws and subsequently agreed to change them.
In Addison, a middle-class suburb on the loops of Interstate highways that rope Chicago to the rest of the Midwest and beyond, many of the residents work on assembly lines or in packing plants, and live in modest ranch houses or split-level homes. In the 1950's and 60's, Addison was a prime destination for white ethnic Chicago families. The village has seen its economy energized in recent years as a convenient place for companies to base their Midwest operations.
Addison officials said they did not intend to drive Hispanic residents out of town. "If it looks that way, we're sorry," Mr. Berley said. "We were doing our duty as public officials. Sometimes you have to do things in the public interest and sometimes a small number of people are going to get hurt in the course of it."
Mr. Berley said the buildings in Addison, 30-year-old yellow or tan brick low-rise apartments, had been built too close together and lacked adequate parking and playgrounds. He said the buildings had fallen victim to maintenance problems ranging from broken steps to cockroaches. Mr. Berley said newer residents were renters without the same stake as earlier owners in keeping up the property. "Hispanic families generally do live several families together in the same unit," he said. "That wears property down."
Mr. Berley also said the neighborhoods had been attracting gangs.
"O.K., they're not Cabrini-Green or Robert Taylor Homes," Mr. Berley said, referring to two of the most notorious Chicago housing projects. "Well, are we supposed to wait till it gets to be a Cabrini-Green?"
Hispanic residents say that Addison officials exaggerate the crime and maintenance problems, and that residents have been working to solve them. In a recent visit, the neighborhoods seemed generally neat, if weathered, with iron or concrete balconies, cut grass and children riding bikes or playing soccer outside.
Rita Gonzalez, 32, left one of Chicago's Mexican neighborhoods 10 years ago for a job in a plastic bag factory in Addison and the goal of better schools for her three sons, one of whom began using Chicago gang signals at age 5. A soft-spoken woman, Ms. Gonzalez said she found herself the reluctant leader of the mushrooming Hispanic community.
Ms. Gonzalez, who lives in one of the two Addison neighborhoods designated for redevelopment and was a plaintiff in the class-action suit, said there had been few serious clashes with the "Anglos" in Addison, but she believed that officials were "surprised at how rapidly the community grew."
Mr. Hernandez who used a disability payment to buy a house in Addison after his apartment building was demolished, said the Hispanic community contributed to the village economy, shopping in local stores and starting their own businesses, like the Tejano and Salsa music store, Mi Pueblo, that his family opened recently. "I feel betrayed by the village," he said. "But this is what I call my home."
The Mayor of Addison, Larry Hartwig, who is principal of a local junior high school, said officials were happy to have Hispanic people living in Addison. "I don't think it's a racial thing," Mr. Hartwig said. "I think it's a cultural thing. I see two types of Hispanics in Addison. There are those that have been here for a long time and are very acculturated. If you didn't know their last name, you wouldn't know they were Hispanic. Like Joe Fernandez, who owns the Pink Pony. He's like everybody else here in town. The newer ones, I don't blame them. We need to educate them. As they come and migrate to our country, they need to adapt and adopt our ways."

HEADLINE: Little Flexibility Seen in Talks Between Teamsters and U.P.S.

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
Leaders of the teamsters' union and the United Parcel Service resumed negotiations yesterday in an effort to end the four-day-old strike, but their public statements indicated little flexibility from either side.
Officials from U.P.S. and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters said wide gaps remained between them, adding that it would be difficult to bridge those differences in just a day or two. 
 Before joining the talks in a Federal mediator's office in Washington, James P. Kelly, the company's chairman, said: "We hope to get this resolved. However, we do have an excellent last, best and final offer."
Ronald Carey, the teamsters' president, voiced concern that the company was returning to the bargaining table for public relations purposes and would not budge from its last offer.
"If it's just a smoke screen," Mr. Carey said, "we're out of here."
Despite the resumption of talks, over a dozen pickets around the country were arrested as they tried to block U.P.S. trucks that were driven by managers. In New York City, the police arrested Abel Whitehead, a striker, and charged him with reckless endangerment for throwing eggs at a truck at the U.P.S. center at 43d Street and 11th Avenue.
The negotiators are deadlocked over the company's demand to set up a new pension plan and the union's demands for a larger raise and for U.P.S. to convert more part-time jobs into full-time ones.
Concerned about economic damage from the strike, business leaders from around the country stepped up their calls for President Clinton to pressure the two sides to reach a settlement so that the 185,000 striking drivers, sorters and loaders could return to work.
Jerry J. Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers, said in an interview: "It's not an emergency yet, but the fact of the matter is if this thing drags on for more than a week or two, it becomes a major problem for the economy. Thus it is essential for the White House and Labor Department to use their good offices to insist that both sides stay at the bargaining table until they resolve their differences."
On Wednesday, the United States Chamber of Commerce and the National Retail Federation sent letters to Mr. Clinton, urging him to push harder to end the strike.
White House officials say the President has encouraged the two sides to talk. But Mr. Clinton said at his news conference on Wednesday that he would not seek an injunction under the Taft-Hartley Act to stop the strike. U.P.S. has called on the President to seek such an injunction from the courts and has urged its customers to make similar appeals.
The strike is already taking its toll on both sides. Some business analysts estimate that U.P.S. is losing at least $50 million a day from the strike, based on an acknowledgment by the company that a one-day teamsters walkout in 1994 cost it $50 million. In addition, U.P.S. executives say they are worried that if the strike drags on, they may lose a permanent market share to the United States Postal Service or Federal Express because regular customers might decide to stay with them.
While many union members treat the first few days of a strike as a festive occasion, they quickly start to feel the financial bite of not receiving a paycheck. Making matters worse for the teamsters, its strike fund is nearly depleted, and that is expected to hamper the union's ability to pay $55 in weekly strike benefits to 185,000 strikers. That would come to more than $10 million a week.
But Steven Trossman, a union spokesman, said: "This strike is not going to be decided by the finances of the teamsters. It will be decided on the issues."

Sculpture
James Graham & Sons
1014 Madison Avenue, at 78th Street
Manhattan
Through Aug. 29
This group show of 19 small sculptures captures, for better or worse, a mood in contemporary art, which involves a certain goofball, what-the-heck attitude that might be called slacker surrealism. Materials are cheap and offhand, but they are often put together with an obsessive attention to detail. The subjects are obsessive, too: they involve odd scenarios or themes that the artist has latched onto, and whether the audience cares about the subject seems not to be the artist's prime concern.
In other words, the works tend to be contentedly obscure and not ingratiating, in the sense that they don't aim for traditional beauty. But they can somehow be visually catchy anyway, and the tenor is mostly wry and unpretentious. 
 In this show, one should just ignore the installations of rows of paper cups, bottled water and toilet paper, which are as ridiculous as they sound. Instead, take a look at Jill Levine's octopus-like abstraction gaudily painted with scenes from Indian movies and art, which makes the work evoke a multilimbed Hindu goddess. Helga Natz has constructed a squarish sculpture out of copper and wax. Elegant, it is the size of a slender cake, bowed in the middle. The effect is an illusion of recession and elongation, as if the square were a rectangle. From Michael Ashkin comes a miniature tableau, a fraction of the size of the one he had in the recent Whitney Biennial and better: it shows a truck, no bigger than the eraser on the end of a pencil, mired in a pool of greenish muck beside a rocky promontory, which has an oil tank on it.
Mr. Ashkin's bleak, featureless landscape captures roughly what Terrence Malick's "Badlands" evoked on the big screen. And Michael Gonzalez has constructed a modernist homage out of interlocking aluminum shaft collars, like a necklace of thick metal rings knotted into a mound.
It's different from Bill Byers's pseudo-modernist sculpture, a striped volute made of fake fur and Astroturf whose title is the work's punch line: "Deep in the Heart of Suburbia." MICHAEL KIMMELMAN

Sleepless And Worried For a Family

BYLINE: By GEORGE VECSEY

 BODY:
NOON games come up fast after night games. Bobby Valentine had no sleep at all, and it had little to do with runs or hits or errors.
"I was doing stuff with Carl and his family," was all Valentine would say about his sleeplessness. 
 The Mets not only had Wednesday night's loss on their minds, they also knew that Carl Everett, one of their teammates, was not available yesterday because of trouble within his family. On Wednesday night, at Shea Stadium, one of Everett's two daughters and his son were taken into protective custody after somebody thought there were bruises on the girl. The action cast a pall over the family and, in consequence, over the team.
Last evening, after investigating, the police said they would not place charges and a police official said the explanation by Everett and his wife would be accepted. By that time, there had been a tense 24-hour period for all concerned.
Because this seems to be very much a team -- in an industry and a free-agency economy that does not encourage togetherness - the Mets, in their silence, showed concern for Everett and his family.
"There is not a bad guy on this team," Butch Huskey said, talking about the chemistry that has helped make the Mets a team on the rise.
Everett may be back in uniform tonight when the Mets begin a four-game series with Houston, but he was not around yesterday when the Mets blasted Colorado, 12-4.
Like most teams these days, the Mets provide a family room where children of the players can romp before and during and after a game. The Mets' room is off a dark corridor on the ground floor, midway between the bullpen, with its tiny vegetable patch, and the Met clubhouse.
"Please Open Door Carefully - Children at Play," says a sign on the family-room door. Inside there are brightly-colored plastic chairs and stools and toys. After yesterday's game, dozens of adults and children milled around happily and noisily, waiting for the players to shower and dress. A security guard at the door said, rather forcefully, that he was in charge of the room.
On Wednesday evening, somebody in that room had reported the possibility of bruises to a club official, who felt enough concern to contact the city child welfare organization, and police officers were called. The two children were temporarily placed in a foster home.
The Mets were making no detailed comment yesterday as Everett and his wife spoke with authorities, but Valentine had cared enough to be available overnight. This came after Tuesday night, when Pete Harnisch made an emotional return after discovering he was suffering from depression in April.
"It's part of the experience," Valentine said yesterday, making a little joke that when he was young and impetuous at Texas, the crises were of his own making.
These are things they don't teach in managing school. Actually, there is no such thing as managing school, no 24-credit degree, no license to hang on the wall. Suddenly, a manager is expected to know something about depression, or child-welfare regulations.
"It's challenging," Valentine said.
The noon game after a night game was an attempt to give that old-fashioned baseball experience to children arriving on yellow day-camp buses. When they made out the schedule, how did the geniuses at Baseball Central know that yesterday would turn up sunny and dry and cool, with gorgeous fluffy clouds floating across?
The Mets were only slightly shook from making only four hits off "what was that guy's name?" as Edgardo Alfonzo benignly referred to John Thomson of Colorado, the Wednesday night winner.
Valentine was not using five regulars yesterday. Bernard Gilkey was not in uniform because of a fever. John Olerud and Todd Hundley and Rey Ordonez were being rested. And Carl Everett was coping with his family crisis. Yet the Mets pounded 16 hits and showed that they will probably not fade any too easily in this pleasant little season they are having.
"It would take somebody smarter than me to explain them," Valentine said. "I'm with 'em. I was with one of their teammates last night."
Plodding along on "a coffee-adrenaline rush," the manager seemed mildly proud of the turnaround victory. His weary eyes displayed concern and respect for the Everett family. Last night all could sleep a bit easier.

Foreign Phone Subsidies Cut
The Federal Communications Commission issued tough new rules to cut the $5.4 billion that American telephone companies pay to foreign carriers to complete their calls. The move could sharply reduce the cost of calling from the United States to many places overseas. The rules, which will be phased in gradually, are intended to jump-start competition in global telecommunications and staunch the flow of dollars from American to foreign carriers.

HEADLINE: Strike Points to Inequality in 2-Tier Job Market

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
In 1982, when the International Brotherhood of Teamsters first agreed to a lower pay scale for part-time workers at United Parcel Service, recently hired part-timers earned $9 an hour, or just $4 less than a full-timer with the same tenure. Today, the part-timers, mostly people who sort packages, still earn $9 an hour while full-timers, mainly the men and women in brown who drive U.P.S. delivery trucks, earn nearly $20.
That sort of eye-catching shift helps to explain why the strike of 185,000 U.P.S. workers, which began on Monday, is a billboard reminder of how far the country has moved toward two tiers of jobs, one with much higher pay and more benefits than the other. Part-timers, temporary workers and contract workers populate much of the lower tier. 
 "This strike is a consciousness-raising event," said Daniel Yankelovich, chairman of DYG Inc., a public opinion polling firm. "What so often happens is that an event like this suddenly and unexpectedly focuses attention on something that is on people's minds and makes their concerns more of a political issue."
The U.P.S. contract negotiations focus naturally on issues like how much to grant in raises, whether to narrow the pay gap between part-timers and full-timers and whether to convert some of the part-time jobs into higher-paying full-time jobs.
But from the struggle over these issues, a broader theme is emerging: whether it is possible, not only at U.P.S. but nationally, to narrow the spread in wages, benefits and job status that has developed since the 1960's. Should part-timers, even if they choose that status to meet their own needs, be paid closer to the full-time wage rate?
The dividing line between the two tiers of wage-earners first showed itself in the early 1970's. For the decade leading up to 1973, nearly everyone's income, whether a worker was earning $200 a week or $1,000, grew by about 25 percent after adjustment for inflation.
Over the next 22 years, until 1995, however, the weekly wages at the low end fell by 22 percent, and for workers in the middle, earning about $500, wages decreased by 10 percent. Meanwhile, skilled white- and blue-collar workers earning about $1,000 a week saw their wages grow by 10 percent to about $1,100 in 1995.
The inequality has widened over the past two years, but at a slower pace, said Peter Gottschalk, a Boston University labor economist who calculates this data from Labor Department statistics. Still, Mr. Gottschalk added, "The strong economy of the past two years has not yet reversed the trend."
The U.P.S. work force roughly mirrors what has happened to workers everywhere. At many companies, an upper tier of full-time "core" workers enjoys the best combination of pay, benefits, hours and job security that a company can offer. Below them is a second tier of less valued part-time, temporary and contract workers who, in addition to being less expensive, can be discharged more easily, giving corporate managers the flexibility that they say is essential to compete in an increasingly global economy.
At U.P.S. the second tier is mostly part-timers, who sort packages and load trucks and planes.
"If we weren't operating with part-timers and paying them the wages that we are paying today, we would be out of business," said Kenneth Sternad, a U.P.S. spokesman.
Mr. Sternad and other U.P.S. executives note that competitors -- Federal Express, for example -- also use part-timers, mainly to sort and load packages on trucks and planes. As nonunion workers, they earn less than workers at U.P.S., and they lack a company-paid health policy, which U.P.S. provides to its part-timers.
U.P.S. executives argue that full-time delivery truck drivers, earning $19.95 an hour, are more valuable to the company than the part-timers. The drivers are the company's direct contact with its customers, and they have to be skilled in the use of hand-held computers.
But the teamsters say that U.P.S. -- and by extension, the nation -- has gone too far in creating lower-tier work. Most of the new U.P.S. jobs since 1993, when the last contract was signed, have been part-time, and that category now represents 60 percent of the teamster jobs at U.P.S., up from 54 percent in 1993 and 42 percent in 1986.
"We recognize that most part-timers can't and won't ever become full-timers," said Paul Boldin, director of research for the teamsters. "So we need to raise the part-time wage."
Apart from pushing to convert 10,000 part-time jobs into higher-paying full-time positions, the teamsters want part-time wages, now $8 to $11, raised by $3.67 an hour over four years. The company is offering $2.50 over five years.
While the gulf at U.P.S. is between full-timers and part-timers, with their unequal pay, elsewhere the inequality shows up in the conditions that separate full-time regular employees from the temporary and contract workers that companies are now employing more often. The latter employees might work a full week rather than part-time hours. Some get even the same hourly wages as regular employees. But they almost always lack health insurance, vacation pay and sick pay.
But the profusion of arrangements is often hard to quantify, and that clouds the debate, even with the stimulus of the U.P.S. strike.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics at the Labor Department, for example, notes that the median wage of full-time workers is $9.36 an hour, compared with $6.01 for part-time workers, a gap that has persisted for years. But Marvin Kosters, director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, concluded in a study that when allowances are made for skills and education, the gap essentially disappears.
Similarly, the bureau notes that the number of part-time workers rose to 19.5 percent of the work force in 1994 from 14 percent in 1968. The percentage has since dropped slightly, but Susan Houseman, a labor economist at the Upjohn Institute, argues that such data fail to account for the growing number of Americans who hold two part-time jobs, or a full-time and a part-time job. They appear instead in the official count as full-timers, working a total of more than 35 hours a week.
Ms. Houseman's survey of 550 companies last summer showed a growing use of part-time workers who cost less than full-timers.
"U.P.S. is by no means an isolated example," she said, "and that makes the strike a platform to debate the broader issues."

HEADLINE: As Slopes Warm Up, the Sound of Festivals

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: ASPEN, Colo.

 BODY:
From a musical kernel planted here half a century ago, summer arts festivals have taken root in the Rockies, spreading this year like alpine wildflowers to 13 Colorado ski towns.
In Telluride, once a backwater silver-mining town, there is a jazz festival, a blues festival, a bluegrass festival, a theater festival, a dance festival and two film festivals. Choking on culture, townspeople recently rebelled and created a guaranteed festival-free weekend in late July: The Nothing Festival. 
 "There are now more summer music festivals in Colorado than in any other state in America," said Robert Harth, president of the Aspen Music Festival, the festival that pioneered music in the Rocky Mountains in 1949.
This summer Vail is host to two orchestras, the Rochester Philharmonic and the Detroit Symphony. Telluride is the summer home of the Joffrey Ballet. Breckenridge is host for the National Repertory Orchestra. In tiny Crested Butte, the demand for music is so strong that the town is supporting two chamber festivals this summer.
The marriage of music and mountains is so successful that the ski towns are witnessing the emergence of increasingly stable, year-round economies.
The impact is most visible in Aspen, where the Music Festival offers 150 events during a 63-day season. Beyond this marathon, the Aspen/ Snowmass Council for the Arts offers events by 23 other member groups. Art show openings are almost a nightly affair this summer as the number of galleries around Aspen has grown to 48.
With 57 percent of arts attendees coming from out of state, arts spending pumps $60 million into the Aspen economy every summer, according to a 1995 study by the University of Colorado's Business Research Division.
In a shift, August has been Aspen's most popular tourist month for the last two years, recording average hotel occupancy rates of 85 percent. Before 1995, March was the busiest month.
"I wouldn't come here without the stimulation," Barbara Rentschler, a retired New Jersey developer who now lives in Florida, said recently before the start of an Aspen Festival Orchestra concert. "I can't run up and down the mountains every day."
Attitudes like this have prompted the arts explosion. In Vail, Bravo! the Colorado Vail Valley Music Festival added the Rochester Orchestra this summer to its traditional schedule of concerts by the Detroit Orchestra. This month principal dancers from the Bolshoi Ballet, the Stuttgart Ballet and American Ballet Theater are performing as part of a new annual summer series, the Vail International Dance Festival.
"The demand for performances and the growth of the whole music phenomenon was strong enough to justify having the two orchestras here this summer," said Ross Boyle, chairman of the Vail Valley Marketing Board, a promotional group.
A decade ago, the gap between winter and summer sales tax revenues in Vail was 50 percent. By last year, Mr. Boyle said, it had narrowed to 19 percent. "With the galleries, the music and the dance," he added, "I would guess that the arts contribute at least one quarter of the draw we have in the summer."
The trend is evident across the Rockies. Jackson Hole, Wyo., has a summerlong series, the Grand Teton Music Festival. Big Sky, Mont., has an arts festival that runs the gamut from cowboy poetry to chamber music. Park City, Utah, has an almost daily summer calendar of arts events including "Music in the Mountains" concerts by the Utah Symphony and dance and chamber music by the Institute at Deer Valley.
"The most successful festivals come from the local community and not from a bunch of promoters going out and grafting something totally unrelated onto the community," said Myles Rademan, spokesman for Park City. Aspen and Park City started with strong artistic communities, added Mr. Rademan, who often works as a consultant with mountain resort towns on growth issues.
In Colorado summer festivals are backed by a strong winter arts reservoir in metropolitan Denver, home to half of the state's four million residents. Contradicting Denver's national image as a sports town, more tickets were sold in 1995 for cultural events -- seven million -- than to major league sports events -- five million. Last winter ticket sales topped a million at the Denver Center for the Performing Arts, a first in the 25-year history of that multistage complex.
In Aspen, where the music festival followed a formula set by Tanglewood in the late 1930's, residents now grumble that other ski towns are merely trying to emulate their success.
"The ski towns are copying what Aspen began almost 50 years ago," W. Harold Laster, dean of the Aspen Music School, said during an intermission at the 1,700-seat tent here. "But they are not doing it because of Aspen's humanistic ideals, of body, mind and spirit. They are doing it to make money in the summer."
Walter Paepcke, a Chicago industrialist, developed skiing here as a way to achieve an idealized community, one where residents and visitors would become well-rounded in art, music, philosophy and athletics. As a living legacy of this vision, the Music Festival is home every summer to about 1,000 music students and teachers. Aspen is believed to have the largest summer music school in the nation.
Because of strong community support, about half of the students live with local families, and three-quarters receive financial aid. Six hundred volunteers give thousands of hours. Drawing on a worldwide alumni network, the Aspen Music School this summer has attracted students from 47 states and 43 countries.
"Aspen is bigger, and there are more opportunies to play," said Marcos Max Valls Martin, a trombonist from Brazil who studied last summer at the music school at Tanglewood, in Lenox, Mass.
In a town where about one out of every seven summer residents is a classical musician, there are concerts in churches, in the newly restored Wheeler Opera House, on the top of Ajax Mountain and on the town's pedestrian mall.
Not satisfied with almost three musical events a day, students put on 50 additional informal performances during the summer. Reflecting this musical energy, a student orchestra played all of Beethoven's nine symphonies in a marathon sitting last summer.
In Aspen, where 17 different arts events are scheduled for the first week of August, cultural offerings now spill into the winter season. Four years ago the Music Festival inaugurated a year-round hall, the 500-seat Joan and Irving Harris Concert Hall.
Aspen's new concert hall did not pass unnoticed by its archrivals in the Vail valley. Next February, Beaver Creek, part of Vail Resorts, is to inaugurate its own 525-seat, year-round theater.
"The number of skiers is flat," Mr. Harth, the Aspen Music Festival president, said, referring to the industry's stagnation. Noting that Harris Hall now presents 30 concerts in the winter, he added: "The arts events are one of the advantages that Aspen has in selling itself as grandmother-friendly. Not everybody surfs, but a lot of families go to Hawaii."

HEADLINE: Casting Call for Candidates

 BODY:
State Comptroller Carl McCall's announcement that he will not run against Gov. George Pataki in 1998 is troubling. Mr. McCall had been regarded as Mr. Pataki's toughest potential challenger ever since Representative Charles Schumer, the previous toughest potential challenger, backed out of the race. Someone has to run against Mr. Pataki. Mr. McCall has one of the strongest political resumes in the state. His analyses of the precarious economics of Mr. Pataki's budgets are compelling, and a McCall-Pataki campaign might have provided a useful education for the voters.
Mr. McCall says he has decided he can best serve the people of New York as the Comptroller, but this is of course politics-speak. There is no politician walking who truly believes that while running the state is all well and good as far as it goes, he can be a bigger help by overseeing the auditors. Mr. McCall has been very vocal in his predictions that Mr. Pataki's new budget is a short-term crowd-pleaser that will turn into a long-term economic disaster. His statement of non-candidacy this week is an acknowledgment that the long term will not be here before November 1998. 
 There are still plenty of major-league or at least triple-A Democrats who might take on Mr. Pataki next year. But Mr. McCall's retreat does not bode well. A year and a half is a very long time in advance of the election to implicitly declare an incumbent unbeatable, especially in a state that has trouble getting a budget finished four months after the deadline. If the great retreat from the governor's race continues, voters know what they can expect. We have seen the future, and it is Pierre Rinfret. If the Democrats wind up scrambling through old Rolodexes for any candidate who can afford to pay his own expenses, they may wind up learning the same sad truth the Republicans did when they nominated Mr. Rinfret in 1990. The Governor at the time, Mario Cuomo, turned out to be weaker than anyone had imagined, and only the embarrassing haplessness of the Rinfret campaign assured him victory.
There is a problem here that goes far beyond Mr. McCall's very reasonable desire for a safe political berth. The modern political process offers no rewards to the man or woman who agrees to make a difficult race for the good of the party. The promising campaigner who makes a game effort against a tough incumbent is not regarded as "seasoned" but simply as a loser. The party may owe him or her a lot. But just try to collect it.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Grain and Soybean Prices Up On Mixed Outlook for Rain

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Grain and soybean futures prices were mostly higher yesterday amid conflicting weather forecasts for parched Midwestern growing areas.
Weather has been driving the soybean and corn markets this week at the Chicago Board of Trade. 
 "Beans need rain, and there is some rain in the forecast, but there are a lot of variations," said Anne Frick, senior oilseed analyst for Prudential Securities Inc. in New York. "If we don't have rain, prices will be sharply higher Monday. If we do, they'll be sharply lower."
Jerry Gidel, grains analyst in Chicago for Dean Witter, said, "Wheat was strengthened on news that Canada reduced its crop size, and Egypt is in for between 300,000 and 500,000 metric tons of our red winter wheat."
New-crop soybeans for November delivery rose 6.5 cents while the old crop, for August delivery, fell 8 cents.
Ms. Frick said, "The old crop was under pressure from farmers moving old-crop beans to take advantage of higher prices, almost a dollar better than the new crop."
November soybeans rose 9 cents, to $6.375 a bushel; December corn was up 4 cents, to $2.57 a bushel; December oats were unchanged at $1.6275 a bushel; September wheat rose 4 cents, to $3.6725 a bushel.
On other commodity markets, precious metals rose while livestock prices were sharply lower, except for live cattle.
In precious metals trading, gold took advantage of the decline in the stock market, and platinum was strengthened by short supplies.
"Supply tightness is the reason for a rally today after a flat day yesterday and a down day the previous day," Aaron Murphy, senior economist for Platinum Guild International, said yesterday.
October platinum was $443.70 an ounce, up $11.10; December gold was at $330.40 an ounce, up $4.60, and September silver was unchanged at $4.37 an ounce.
Live cattle futures prices were higher on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while feeder cattle, pork bellies and lean hogs all declined.
October live cattle rose 0.72 cent, to 70.20 cents a pound; August feeder cattle fell 0.20 cent, to 80.17 cents a pound; October lean hogs dropped 0.47 cent, to 72.50 cents a pound, and August pork bellies fell 2.37 cents, to 82.52 cents a pound.

HEADLINE: 80,000 Children Dying in North Korea, U.N. Says

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Aug. 8

 BODY:
The executive director of Unicef said today that about 80,000 children in North Korea were in immediate danger of dying from hunger and disease and at least 800,000 more were suffering malnutrition to a serious but lesser degree.
"It's a crisis where people are dying and are going to die," the director, Carol Bellamy, said at a news conference. Ms. Bellamy returned on Thursday from a visit to North Korea. There, she and other international aid officials pooled information from many parts of the isolated country. 
 Ms. Bellamy said the North Korean Government had changed its attitude in the last three to six months and was allowing agencies to work in more areas.
Only the northeast corner of the country is still off-limits to foreigners, she said. Everywhere aid officials go, they see demonstrations of North Korea's ramshackle state economy failing to cope with multiple crises.
"The pantries are bare," said Ms. Bellamy, a former director of the Peace Corps. "Hospital medicine cabinets are empty. And the results could be catastrophic if these shortages are not eased by winter.
"We are seeing children up to the age of 15 who are severely malnourished and in danger of dying. Starvation hits babies first; older children have more resistance. These children have been chronically short of food all year."
Ms. Bellamy said fewer children had been coming to schools where relief officials worked. In Government nurseries or orphanages, many children are "very, very sick," she said.
While relief agencies are not able to estimate the number of North Koreans who may have already died, officials are forming a broader picture of the disaster facing the country of 24 million people after two years of floods and two months of severe drought. But aid workers are beginning to accumulate anecdotal evidence of deaths as they distribute food and medicine.
Ms. Bellamy said today that at a state nursery, she had met children whose parents had recently died, at least in one case of diarrhea, which malnourished people have no strength to resist. Another child, who had lost both parents, was turned over to the state by a grandmother who could no longer feed her.
Unicef, the United Nations Children's Fund, has appealed for $14.3 million to buy emergency supplies for North Korea, particularly medicines and milk fortified with vitamins and minerals. Since April the organization has flown 70 tons of fortified milk, medicine and feeding equipment to North Korea for use in 92 hospitals and orphanages.
Most of the contributions have come from European countries. Ms. Bellamy said today that she was asking the United States to contribute as well, so that more milk can be airlifted.
On Monday the World Food Program, Unicef and Save the Children will begin a study intended to determine North Korea's needs and the condition of its people.

HEADLINE: First Battle for the New Congress in Mexico: Tax Cuts

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Aug. 8

 BODY:
Mexico's new Congress will not be formally seated in the labyrinthine Palace of St. Lazarus until Sept. 1, but the first order of business is already clear. It is a familiar fight for any democracy: what to do about campaign promises to lower taxes.
In the election last month, the governing party lost its majority in Congress for the first time in 68 years. Now, Mexicans are learning that promising to cut taxes, as opposition parties did in the campaign, was easier than actually doing so, just as proclaiming a democracy may turn out to be far less difficult than making it work. 
 The tug-of-war between the Government and Congress has already started.
At stake in the debate over taxes is Mexico's economic recovery, a strict Government regimen of taxes and limited spending that helped bring the country back from the brink of economic disaster in 1995.
Mexican and United States officials insist that the recovery plan, backed by Washington, would be gored by the kind of tax cuts and economic tinkering -- including an overhaul of the North American Free Trade Agreement -- promised by candidates from four opposition parties.
In the past, opposition legislators routinely voted against tax increases, even though Mexicans are not heavily taxed and increases are seen as necessary to support education, health and other services that the opposition supports. Now many of them, facing new tests as they assume a share of real power, will be caught between their advocacy of greater social spending and the siren call of campaign promises to cut taxes.
Though they offered little in the way of economic justification for a tax cut, the opposition candidates connected with voters. Now the four parties together outnumber the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, in the 500-seat lower house of Congress.
If they overcome their wide differences, will form a unified opposition majority. But of the two largest opposition parties, one is to the left of the PRI and one is to its right.
The opening days of the new Congress will also test the degree to which the election on July 6 really was the historic breakthrough that has been claimed.
After so many years of one-party rule, can power really be shared by a dominant President and a legislature that until now has been little more than a sounding board controlled by the President's party?
It will probably not be easy. Last week, President Ernesto Zedillo addressed Mexican business leaders who had grown skittish over continued soundings about tax cuts. He unequivocally declared that there would be no change in Mexico's economic course.
The next day, a Congressman-elect who is leader of an opposition party's legislative caucus told Mr. Zedillo to reread the Constitution.
"I told him that he should read the Constitution again so that he will know what he's facing," said Porfirio Munoz Ledo, who will be the leader for the Party of the Democratic Revolution, or P.R.D., in the new Congress. "The economic policy of Mexico is not decided by him alone. It is a responsibility that is shared with the Congress."
The governing party's dominance of Congress until now has been so complete that there is no legal provision for selecting the equivalent of the Speaker of the House in circumstances when no party has an absolute majority.
Already there is intense jockeying for leadership positions and posturing for the moral high ground in the new legislature. Because of Mexico's prohibition against consecutive terms in any political office, there is no seniority system and every legislator is considered a freshman, although some have had experience in local legislatures.
In going after the long-governing PRI, opposition candidates vowed to cut the immensely unpopular value added tax on most goods, which was raised to 15 percent from 10 percent in early 1995. At that time, even though not one opposition member of the lower house voted for the tax increase, the PRI had enough votes on its own to pass it.
In the new Congress, the PRI will still have more seats than any other party, but it will not have a majority. While the directly elected members are already selected, the electoral authorities must still determine the final allocation of seats based on the proportion of the overall vote captured by each party. The results are not expected to change significantly.
As it now stands, the PRI has 239 of the 500 seats, the P.R.D., 125, the National Action Party, or PAN, 122, and two smaller parties a total of 14 that now become enormously important because of their ability to swing a vote. Legislation is passed by a majority vote of those members who are present.
Opposition leaders say the new Congress will not limit itself to reducing taxes. They want to revise Nafta and rework Mexico's entire economic course.
The approval of both houses of Congress is needed to pass the Government's revenue package, and the PRI still holds a majority in the Senate. But the lower house alone approves the budget.
Since Mexico devalued its currency in 1994, the country has endured successive austerity budgets. While such measures are perceived in Government and financial circles as having helped the economy recover, the Mexican people feel choked by them.
For the United States, which backed President Zedillo's recovery plan and put up $20 billion in loans to support Mexico, a politically motivated rush to rewrite Mexico's economic plans would be a disaster.
Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers, who was instrumental in the Mexico rescue plan, met with opposition leaders in Mexico City this week. He said the leaders of all parties had expressed "a willingness to work things out."
"Clearly, the next few months will be an important test for Mexico's democratic institutions," Mr. Summers said at a briefing with reporters. But "it would be a serious error," he said, "to suppose that somehow multi-partisanship is inherently more risky or inherently more divisive" than one-party rule.
While he admitted that "gridlock is possible," along the lines of the budget impasse that nearly shut down the United States Government last year, he said policies with multiparty support tended to be healthier for a society than those rammed through by just one party.
During the recent campaign, the opposition parties of the left, center and right all formally vowed to undo the value added tax.
Finance Minister Guillermo Ortiz Martinez has said that reducing the value added tax rate to 10 percent from the current 15 percent would cost Mexico $3.2 billion a year that the opposition parties have not explained how they would make up.
"They are accusing us of voodoo economics, but it is not so," Mr. Munoz Ledo said. He said the Mexican people had suffered enough from Governments run by economists, like Mr. Zedillo, who had never before held public office. Now, he said, they demand an economic policy that meets their needs.
"The commitment of the opposition parties to lower the value added tax is a formal promise," Mr. Munoz Ledo said. "It would be an enormous affront to the people if we didn't do it."
There is no way to tell whether the opposition parties will vote in unison against the PRI. Alfonso Zarate, a Mexican political analyst, says even a weakened PRI still has the resources to defend its interests. Rather than reform, the new congressional alignment could bring a return to corrupt past practices, he said.
"The PRI is going to achieve its majorities by buying votes, delivering privileges, giving concessions, paying for trips," Mr. Zarate said. "The new alignment of forces will force the PRI to do so."
The lower house will have about a month to debate the President's budget proposal before voting. Since Mexico's Congress cannot pass continuing resolutions the way the one in Washington did in last year's impasse, it cannot prevent a shutdown should negotiations become deadlocked.
"If there is no budget by Dec. 31," Finance Minister Ortiz said, "we can just turn off the lights and go home."
In the past, party discipline was absolute and members strayed from the party line at their political peril. But to avoid impasse in the new Congress, alliances will be common, although it is not at all clear who the natural allies are.
The head of the PRI caucus in the new Congress, Arturo Nunez Jimenez, says the ideological distance between the PRI and the nationalist P.R.D. on many issues is less than between the conservative PAN and the P.R.D. He expects alliances between the PRI and other parties to alternate depending on the vote.
"It is possible that for some issues there might be a certain combination of votes and for others a different one," Mr. Nunez said. "But we're not talking about just one majority and one opposition. We're talking about many alliances, and forming them is part of the legislative work we face."
An influential congressman from the PAN, Santiago Creel, said the first few months of the new Congress would show how successfully power was being shared in Mexico.
"Something that can give you a signal that things have changed is that we are able to reopen the Conasupo investigation," he said, referring to a congressional investigation into corruption at a Government commodities distribution agency that was shut down by the PRI last year when too many questions were being asked.
Mr. Creel said there would be other congressional investigations as well: into suspect privatizations of banks, railroads and highways; of a 1995 massacre of peasants by the police in Guerrero State that exonerated the PRI Governor despite indications that he might have been involved; into the manner in which members of Mr. Zedillo's Government carry out their duties as servants of the Mexican people.
"This does not mean it it be a Congress of confrontation, or that we want to start a holy war against the executive branch," Mr. Creel said. "It simply will be a moment in which the basic mechanisms of a democratic system begin to function."

HEADLINE: Helicopter Company Loses Bankruptcy Plea, Clearing Way for City Eviction Move

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON 

 BODY:
A Federal bankruptcy judge in Brooklyn dismissed a bankruptcy filing from Island Helicopters yesterday, giving the city the right to move to evict the company from the East 34th Street Heliport, which the city owns.
The company, which also operates as National Helicopter, has been battling the city for years. As the heliport's major tenant since 1973, the company takes tourists on sightseeing flights over the Statue of Liberty, Central Park and Yankee Stadium, and is responsible for nearly 40 percent of the 400 takeoffs and landings at the city's four heliports every day. 
 It has continued operating despite the expiration of its lease and a continuing battle with the city over back rent and what the city maintained was Island Helicopters' failure to prepare required environmental reports.
Yesterday's decision, by Judge Jerome Feller, said that the city had served an eviction notice on Island Helicopters on April 29. The company went to Federal court on May 1, seeking an injunction to prevent the eviction, but the request was turned down. On May 2, Island Helicopters made a second attempt to avoid being thrown out of the heliport, this time in State Supreme Court, but withdrew the action later that day and sought Federal bankruptcy protection instead, which automatically stopped the eviction process.
A bankruptcy declaration would have allowed Island Helicopters to continue operating while it came to new terms with creditors, including the city. Yesterday, Judge Feller dismissed the bankruptcy plea, saying it had been "filed in bad faith."
Judge Feller called the bankruptcy petition "little more than a desperate legal stratagem" intended mainly to "delay and obstruct the city" in its efforts to take control of the heliport. He said that in the dispute over payment of rent, the company had fallen $336,000 behind by 1989 but that it promised, in April 1993, to pay $226,000. By July 1993, the judge said, the city had questioned whether the company would make good on the agreement.
"The debtor has little else sustaining it" other than the heliport, Judge Feller wrote. He added that it was otherwise an "assetless corporation" that could not pay its bankruptcy lawyer's retainer.
After the ruling, Charles Millard, president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, which is the heliport's landlord, said, "We're very pleased with the court's decision."
A lawyer for Island Helicopters, J. Stanley Shaw, did not return telephone calls seeking comment.
Several aircraft in the Island Helicopters fleet have been involved in accidents in recent years. One of the company's helicopters lost power and had to make an emergency landing in the East River in October 1993. Several months earlier, another Island Helicopters craft made an emergency landing in Central Park under similar circumstances.

HEADLINE: In Quitting, Scientists Say Beach Repair Is Foolhardy

 BODY:
Accusing the Army Corps of Engineers of ignoring Federal environmental law in a rush to begin a $60 million dune- and beach-rebuilding project on Fire Island, two biologists resigned their Government jobs yesterday in protest.
The biologists, staff members of the Fish and Wildlife Department's regional office on Long Island, said the Corps was withholding information about the project, which they said would damage natural systems, provide no proven protection against storms and cost more than $100 million over its 30-year life when maintenance costs were included. 
 "They are not informing the public about the magnitude of this project," said Robert G. Murray, who said he resigned in frustration over "Federal agencies' not following Federal law and breaking the public trust."
"To approve this project would irreparably harm Long Island's coastal environment," Mr. Murray, 30, of Center Moriches, N.Y., said.
The second biologist, David M. Edelstein, 39, of Islip, N.Y., said the Corps was downplaying the size of the project to avoid public scrutiny.
"This is an enormous project," he said. "It will rearrange the ecosystem of the entire South Shore of Long Island. The Army Corps should not be given this ecosystem to manage without first showing they understand it."
The New York district office of the Corps denied the biologists' charges and said a complete environmental study would be performed before the project begins. "I hate to giggle, but it is a little presumptuous to assume we are going ahead with anything," said Joseph R. Vietri, the deputy chief of planning for the New York district office. He said the project could not begin before 2000.
The project would dump nine million cubic yards of sand pumped from offshore along a 15-mile area of Fire Island to rebuild beaches and restore dunes damaged during severe storms in 1992 and 1993. Most of the work would be performed in summer communities from Kismet to Point O' Woods, the Corps said.
Mr. Vietri said the project would bolster the Fire Island barrier island as a first line of defense for the mainland against storms and storm surges.
Mr. Murray and Mr. Edelstein said there was no convincing proof that the project would protect the mainland. They said it would block natural events like wash-overs and breaches during storms that supplied ocean water to inland bays and increased biological diversity.
"There would be no damage you would see today or tomorrow," Mr. Edelstein said. "But it is a project designed to impede the natural flow of energy in and out of the ecosystem. If you impede it, there is a high risk of a major rupture later."
The biologists said the Army Corps was favoring the interests of property owners and an influential property owners' group, the Fire island Association.
The association's president, Gerard Stoddard, said that repairing beaches on Fire Island has enormous economic benefits for the public and inland areas, and he said his group was prepared to contribute as much as $4 million toward the work.
Mr. Murray said that neither he nor Mr. Edelstein was a member of any environmental group and that they had arranged a news conference yesterday in Mineola on their own. Mr. Murray said he was reluctant to voice his concerns publicly while still employed by the Fish and Wildlife Service. "I felt it would be risky," he said.
Mr. Murray had worked in the Fish and Wildlife Service Long Island office for five years, and Mr. Edelstein for two.

Rockets From Lebanon Strike Northern Israel
Tensions grew in Israel after rockets fired from Lebanon slammed into Qiryat Shemona, a town near the country's northern border. The attack came after a week of escalating attacks between Israeli forces and Hezbollah guerrillas. One Israeli woman was wounded and a synagogue was damaged by the rockets. 6 

Disbanding Bosnian Police
In a decision that diplomats said could be both helpful and dangerous, the American general in charge of NATO forces in Bosnia disclosed a plan to force paramilitary police forces to disband or to face being disbanded by NATO soldiers. Diplomats and human rights monitors said that paramilitary police were the most responsible for enforcing the will of nationalist hard-liners. 3
 
Strike Turns Violent in Kenya
A strike in Kenya called by advocates of constitutional reform turned violent as mobs beat a policeman to death, looted shops and broke windows in Nairobi. A rally in support of the strike turned bloody when a crowd of people recognized a plainclothes policeman and beat him to death. Western Governments and human rights groups have accused police of brutality in previous demonstrations. 3
 
South African Talks Stop
South Africa's second-largest black party said it would break off talks with the African National Congress on ending political violence in the province of Kwazulu-Natal. Testimony before a commission investigating apartheid-era atrocities linked the Inkatha Freedom Party to hit squads; angry leaders of the party demanded an investigation of the impartiality of the panel, which they called a creation of the African National Congress. 3
 
Pilot Error Cited in Guam Crash
United States officials in Guam said that newly gathered evidence points to pilot error, not mechanical failure, as the cause of the Korean Air jetliner crash. The National Transportation Safety Board said the pilots were in control of the plane and did not know they were flying too low.

The Food and Drug Administration issued new guidelines for prescription drug advertising on radio and television that it said would make the advertisements more useful to consumers. The guidelines, which have been under consideration for months, will allow drug manufacturers to describe the benefits of the drugs without providing long, detailed notices of the side effects. Instead, the F.D.A. said, the drug companies would only be required to include in the advertisements a "brief summary" of the major risks. The ads could include a toll-free number or an Internet address where consumers could get more details. 35

Lawyer Is Accused of Fraud

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN 

DATELINE: NEWARK

 BODY:
While collecting unemployment after leaving his job at a Parsippany law firm in 1992, a lawyer from Pound Ridge, N.Y., illegally earned at least $58,000, prosecutors said.
The lawyer, Robert Barry Green, 42, was charged with fraud in Federal court yesterday. He was accused of earning more than $8,000 in consulting fees from the law firm of Weiner Lesniak and more than $50,000 in real estate commissions from a corporation he owned with the law firm's partners in 1992 and 1993, said Noel L. Hillman, an assistant United States attorney. 
 One of those partners is State Senator Raymond J. Lesniak of Elizabeth, a longtime adviser to State Senator James E. McGreevey, the Democratic candidate for governor.

HEADLINE: Affirmative Action Isn't Issue in Piscataway Case;
O'Connor's Record

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Despite Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's seemingly moderate opinions that appear to allow some racial preferences, her voting record shows not the slightest inclination to do so (front page, Aug. 4). 
 Justice O'Connor has consistently voted against claims of racial minorities. In affirmative action cases, she has ignored her own prior decisions and opinions on access to the courts, federalism and Federal power that would have supported the minority position. Civil rights lawyers expect her to vote against the black teacher in the Piscataway affirmative action case, for they must look to what a judge does, not just what a judge says.

HEADLINE: SMALL BUSINESSES SUFFER THE MOST FROM U.P.S. STRIKE

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Aug. 8

 BODY:
A mechanic in Iowa cannot get parts for car repairs. Pet fish are stranded at a Florida distributor. Cases of wine are stacking up at a mail-order vineyard in California.
The strike against United Parcel Service, which began on Monday, has strained small businesses around the country, especially those on tight schedules or tight profit margins. 
 "It has caused a tremendous crimp in our business," said Christopher Britton, chief financial officer for the Liberty Malt Supply Company, a distributor of home-brew ingredients in Seattle. "It basically cuts our mail-order business, and it will be hard to rejuvenate it if it's a longer strike."
Judging from interviews with people at scores of businesses throughout the United States, from the computer giant Microsoft to the Elbert car lot and repair shop in Whittemore, Iowa, the smaller the business, the bigger the headaches.
Most big businesses, on the other hand, appeared to be weathering the strike more effectively, or at least are conveying that image. Many big businesses, including leading retailers, however, say a prolonged walkout would eventually overwhelm contingency plans and eat up profits.
For now, nothing has slowed the smokestacks at LTV Steel, Inland Steel, U.S. Steel and Amoco. At the Microsoft Corporation, which sends out about 2,500 packages a day, shipping has simply been shifted to other carriers, said Mark Murray, a company spokesman.
"You don't exactly send aircraft engines by U.P.S.," said Mark Greenberg, a spokesman for Allied Signal.
A spokesman for General Electric, Bruce Bunch, said the strike had not registered even a blip on the business screen of the huge company.
"We have other vendors handling our package shipment needs," Mr. Bunch said, "and have seen no significant business impact."
But life without the familiar brown-suited U.P.S. delivery workers has not been so easy for New Meadows Lobsters, a distributor in Portland, Me., with 10 employees.
"This is the high time of the season," said Pete McAleney, the exasperated owner of the wholesale concern. "Tourists come in and want to ship lobsters to friends at home. And now they can't."
After the first full business week without U.P.S., it seemed clear that the biggest companies were being hurt the least by the strike, while many mom-and-pop concerns said they were being stymied.
"We can afford to do this for a few days, but not for a month," said Larry Levi, the general manager of Pacific Coast Products, a 10-employee company in San Francisco that has been hiring more expensive freight trucks to ship its nuts, dried fruit and snacks. "We'll lose our shirts shipping only with trucks."
When it comes to life-and-death concerns, like the delivery of medicine, the strike appears to be posing no serious threat. Pharmaceutical and medical distribution companies typically deliver goods themselves.
"These guys have their own transportation networks, mainly their own trucks," said Larry Marsh, an analyst of drug and medical companies at Salomon Brothers. "I'm not aware of any critical needs being unmet."
Although U.P.S. handles blood products for some companies, most had time to stock up before the strike.
"There was enough lead time," said Lynn Gentry, a spokesman for VHA Inc., a national buyer for 1,500 health care organizations. "The real impact will show up next week" when those supplies run low."
Much of the slack of moving packages was being picked up by the Federal Express Corporation and the United States Postal Service. Express Mail and Priority Mail were running 75 percent above normal levels for this time of year, the Postal Service reported.
"It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas," said Sandra Harding, a spokeswoman at the Postal Service.
Customers at Federal Express were being told that nothing could be promised. Shirlee Clark, a spokeswoman for Federal Express, said the crushing demands had "approached the peak holiday season" of 4 million packages a day. The usual volume is 2.8 million a day, Ms. Clark said.
Federal Express has said it will limit pickup service on Saturday to catch up on deliveries. The Postal Service said parcels in some places would be delivered at no extra charge on Sunday if the strike continued.
Donald Ratajczak, the head of economic forecasting at Georgia State University, said, "About half the packages in the United States are not moving right now."
Coming in August rather than autumn, the strike is occurring at a relatively good time, economists say.
"August is a good time for a strike, because there is not a lot of stuff being done," said David Wyss, research director at DRI/McGraw Hill, an economic consulting company.
David J. Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, suggested that the strike could ultimately affect wage rates.
"This is the first major strike we have had in some time," Mr. Fine said, "and it could have an impact on wage settlements going down the road."
He added, "You could make a case that it could be a bellwether for union wage demands and pressures over the upcoming period."
For retailers, it seems clear that the strike has started to nibble on profits, even if only marginally, and that costs could rise for the quarter if the strike goes unresolved for weeks.
A spokeswoman at the Kmart Corporation, Shawn M. Kahle, said increases of 10 percent to 15 percent in alternative shipping for some items represents "a small dot on the expense line for now."
Retailers have characterized the effect of the strike in seemingly irreconcilable ways. On one hand, many retail executives were quick to tell customers to expect business as usual -- at worst, the strike would delay packages by a few days. But over 30 retail executives signed a letter to President Clinton warning that "the ramifications of the strike are alarming," and urging him to intervene.
The consequences seem much more dire for companies like Hatco, a maker of cowboy hats in Garland, Tex. With boxes of cowboy hats piling up, the company has cut back its manufacturing operation to a four-day week. And it could be forced to start laying off workers.
"If the strike continues, it's going to shut us down," said Al Luiz, vice president of Hatco, which relies on U.P.S. to move 90 percent of its daily shipment of 300 to 400 packages.
If the strike drags on and shipping difficulties worsen, the small businesses that depend on U.P.S. could face serious problems. Altogether, small businesses account for more than 50 percent of all jobs.
Many smaller companies, unable to ship inventory, are beginning to run out of storage space.
The shelves of Jam Plastics, a family-run plastics maker in Anaheim, Calif., are filled with a backlog of about 80 boxes that should have been delivered days ago.
"Usually, there is nothing on the shelves," said Bruce Buettell, a company vice president.
Before long, Mr. Buettell added, workers will need to lay pallets on the floor to store more unshipped products, like security badge holders and neck chains.
The company has tried to send out orders through the Postal Service. But that means taking a worker off the production line and having him drive to the post office, rather than simply waiting for pickup service.
"You know, the President stopped the American Airlines strike," said Cirilio Vazquez, the company's production supervisor. "Why can't he stop the U.P.S. strike?"
Even at some larger companies, a long strike could pose problems.
"So far we've been O.K.," said a spokesman for the Xerox Corporation. "But the consensus is that if this strike goes on much longer, things will really get difficult."
Difficulties are mounting at some companies. Textron Inc., for example, switched early this week to Federal Express, Airborne, and other carriers to ship electrical tools, watch bands and the handful of other products that it sells through retail outlets like Home Depot or Wal-Mart.
But a company spokeswoman, Susan Gillette, said those carriers were starting to get backlogged.
"It started taking two days to deliver a package marked, 'Urgent, Same Day Delivery!" Ms. Gillette said, adding that Federal Express and Airborne were now telling customers to expect three-day delays soon.
"Our customers understand that it is not our fault," she said, "but they are frustrated."
The strike stranded nearly 10,000 fish, bound for pet shops around the nation, at the L Segrest fish distributor near Tampa, Fla., "Swedish Erota XXX" tapes had yet to arrive at the Varsity Adult Video store in Lakeland. And the Kathleen High School band was concerned that its marching shoes would not arrive in time for the school's first football game in September.
The strike was even holding up sporting gear for professional baseball teams. When the Baltimore Orioles flew from Montreal to Seattle this week, their bats were supposed to be shipped along. They were not.
Brady Anderson, star centerfielder for the Orioles, went to Oliver Roy, shipping manager for the Seattle Mariners, and asked for a bat.
"I don't have it," Mr. Roy had to tell him.
The center-fielder did not stop looking for a bat.
"Brady beat us with an 11th-inning homer," Mr. Roy said, "so obviously they have bats."
The M. Putterman Recreational Company, which makes recreation equipment, including tennis and volleyball nets, has school systems as clients that cannot afford to wait.
The strike has taught a lesson to Janis and Jon Moran, the owners of Moran Design in Hammond, Ind.
"Use more than one delivery company," Mrs. Moran said.
At Big Sky Balloons and Searchlights in the Chicago suburb of Plainfield, a 15-foot inflatable rubber rat has been trapped. It was supposed to be shipped to New York earlier this week, said Kathryn Bertram, who works at Big Sky. The giant rodent was to be used to mock strike-breakers and nonunion companies.
"But we couldn't ship the rat to the union," Ms. Bertram said, "because of the strike."

HEADLINE: The Fall and Rise Of Kilmer McCully

BYLINE: By Michelle Stacey; Michelle Stacey is the author of "Consumed: Why Americans Love, Hate, and Fear Food."

 BODY:
In 1981, when kilmer mccully started commuting from his home in a boston suburb to a new job in Providence, R.I., he would drive past the domed Rhode Island Capitol. High atop the dome stands a statue called "The Independent Man" -- a representation of Roger Williams, the Puritan founder of Providence. "Because of Williams's religious beliefs, he was thrown out of Boston," McCully says now. "It sounded familiar." McCully, too, felt like an outcast when he went to Providence from Boston, though he was a scientific rather than a religious infidel. He had left appointments at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital under a cloud, told that his research had dead-ended. He had been denounced by some fellow scientists and ignored by others. His research grants had withered away. He took refuge in a pathology job far from the fast track at the Providence Veterans Administration Medical Center.
These are distinctly better days for McCully, who is now 63. His lifetime's study of a little-understood trigger for heart disease is suddenly at the forefront of cardiac research. His theory -- the same one that came close to scuttling his career -- holds that homocysteine, an amino acid in the blood, damages artery walls and causes heart attacks, and that in most cases homocysteine can easily be lowered to safe levels by taking certain common vitamins. If he's right, homocysteine could join cholesterol, smoking and high blood pressure as a major culprit of heart disease, accounting for (and perhaps someday preventing) upward of 10 to 15 percent of all cases. For an illness that kills nearly 1,500 Americans a day, these are serious numbers. 
 Homocysteine is the theory of the moment in a notoriously competitive field, and McCully's name is inextricably tied to its ascent. He has been called "the father of homocysteine" at meetings of leading international figures in cardiology and epidemiology. His book, "The Homocysteine Revolution: Medicine for the New Millennium," was published in May. Where once McCully's was almost a lone voice in homocysteine research, now dozens of articles have appeared in scientific journals, including one a few weeks ago in The New England Journal of Medicine. Where once the theory was shunned by the grant-giving powers that be, the National Institutes of Health recently put out a request for applications for further research, and at least one large-scale study of homocysteine in humans is already under way.
While McCully says he is "grateful" and "thrilled" that his work is being appreciated, there is a bittersweet quality to his current success and to his anointment as an innovator. A personality more prone to might-have-beens would find it easy to dwell on the contrast between his present situation and that of more than 20 years ago -- another moment when accolades and recognition seemed almost within reach. But beyond the issue of McCully's halted career, those concerned about heart disease -- the nation's No. 1 cause of death -- might wonder, what took so long?
 The son of two schoolteachers, McCully grew up in Colorado as a self-described "boy scientist." After graduating from Harvard College and Harvard Medical School, he embarked on a series of research fellowships. In the mid-60's, as a young pathology instructor at Harvard, McCully made the scientific observation that would define his career. He became intrigued by two different cases of children with homocystinuria, a rare genetic disease in which the levels of homocysteine in the blood are unnaturally high. In both cases, the cause of death was severe arteriosclerosis, a narrowing and loss of elasticity in arteries that is normally seen only in the elderly. By re-examining the autopsy tissues of both children and drawing on previous animal research, McCully emerged with two linked and provocative suggestions: perhaps homocysteine directly damages the cells and tissues of the arteries, in much the way that cholesterol is thought to do, and perhaps that damage occurs not just in these rare genetic cases but in the population at large, in any people with elevated homocysteine levels.
He soon expanded his theory to include a probable cause of elevated levels of homocysteine: a deficiency of vitamins B6, B12 and folic acid. When these vitamins were administered to animals with high homocysteine levels, those levels plummeted, often within hours. Once McCully started extrapolating from his cellular-tissue and animal studies to the human situation, he says, "it all began to fit together."
Homocysteine in the body derives from methionine, an essential amino acid present in large amounts in protein from animal sources like meat, eggs and milk. If there are adequate levels of vitamins B6, B12 and folic acid in the body, the homocysteine is broken down into harmless waste products or protein building blocks. But if there's a deficiency of those vitamins, the homocysteine begins its ravages on the blood vessels.
What, then, is the diet most likely to lead to heart disease, according to the homocysteine theory? One high in animal protein and low in B-vitamins, which occur in many foods but are very easily destroyed by processing -- a diet of meat, cheese, milk, white flour and foods that are canned, boxed, refined, processed or preserved. The American diet, in other words.
Here was a strong connection between diet and heart disease, but one that took a different path from cholesterol. The homocysteine theory considers arteriosclerosis a disease of what McCully calls "protein intoxication." The cholesterol theory (sometimes called the lipid theory) instead demonizes fats. Since proteins and fats often occur in the same foods, the potential dietary treatments for high homocysteine and high cholesterol are similar, with this distinction: the anti-homocysteine diet focuses on what should be eaten, as a preventive, while the anti-cholesterol diet focuses on what should be avoided, as a precipitator. Thus, a diet of lower homocysteine would include many natural sources of B-vitamins like fresh fruits and vegetables and would limit animal protein. The cholesterol-reducing diet would limit foods high in saturated fats and cholesterol, like eggs, meat and butter.
But dietary intervention often fails to lower cholesterol levels, and the next step is drug therapy. A new class of drugs called statins has been more effective than previous drugs at lowering cholesterol with few side effects, but questions have been raised about the safety of long-term use. No clinical consensus on how to treat high homocysteine has yet emerged, but most researchers say that the logical course is simply to take a multivitamin. Studies suggest an optimal daily intake of 3 to 3.5 milligrams of B6, 350 to 400 micrograms of folic acid and 5 to 15 micrograms of B12; many multivitamins contain these amounts.
"For the first few years, everywhere I turned I got evidence that the basic idea was correct," McCully recalls. He injected rabbits with homocysteine and within weeks found arteriosclerotic plaques in their coronary arteries. If the animals were also given a diet deficient in vitamin B6, the plaques were more widespread. While others conducted similar experiments with baboons, McCully examined and manipulated cell cultures from children with homocystinuria. Two Australian researchers, Bridget and David Wilcken, published the first human study in 1976, showing a possible connection between coronary heart disease and high elevations of blood homocysteine.
Then, in the mid-70's, the homocysteine theory began to lose momentum. McCully believes that his support at Harvard and Mass. General began to flag after his department chief and mentor, Benjamin Castleman, retired in 1974. Castleman, who died in 1982, had helped review McCully's findings, sponsored him for lectures and showcased his work before a prestigious panel of experts.
Under the new chief, Robert T. McCluskey, this backing eroded. He was moved to an inferior laboratory in the basement, he lost staffers and his N.I.H. funding was running out. "With the changes in my lab and the loss of some key collaborators, it was difficult to come up with new ideas," he says. "I felt very cut off from everybody, and there was no encouragement. Then they told me that if I didn't renew my grant, I would definitely be out. Their view, I suppose, was that I was no longer productive. My view was that I was being discouraged at every turn."
McCluskey, who is no longer the department head, now says that the key issue was money. "It's certainly true that, perhaps because his idea at that time wasn't generally accepted, he wasn't able to get funding for research after his grants ran out," he says. "There was some uncertainty at the time about how important his work was. Anyone doing research at Mass. General has to apply for and eventually succeed in getting outside funding, and McCully was unable -- in fact, unwilling -- to do that. He wanted the department to support him, which wasn't possible on a long-term basis. So he was asked to either attempt to get further support or to leave."
McCully acknowledges that he eventually did give up on obtaining another N.I.H. grant. "My enthusiasm had been drained," he says. "In that atmosphere, and because I hadn't generated a lot of new information, I felt it was hopeless to apply for a new grant -- that I wouldn't get it." But he denies that he asked the pathology department to support his research. "I'd already been told by the director of the hospital that it was felt at Harvard that I had not proven my theory," he says. "In fact, when I left he told me never to come back."
The current chief of pathology at Mass. General, Robert Colvin, agrees with his predecessor that "the main issue was that nobody could fund McCully's research," but he emphasizes the funders' short-sightedness. "McCully was so far advanced in his thinking about the biochemistry," Colvin says. "And N.I.H. is not very good at funding very innovative, creative research. They're better at funding natural extensions of existing theories."
Since Mass. General and Harvard appointments go hand in hand and McCully had not been recommended for tenure at Harvard, both jobs formally ended in January 1979. At about the same time, a former classmate at Harvard who went on to become the director of the Arteriosclerosis Center at M.I.T. attacked his ideas as "errant nonsense" and a "hoax that is being perpetrated on the public." McCully says that when he was interviewed on Canadian television after he left Harvard, he received a call from the public-affairs director of Mass. General. "He told me to shut up," McCully recalls. "He said he didn't want the names of Harvard and Mass. General associated with my theories."
In retrospect, it seems clear that McCully was a man ahead of his time when the times were all about cholesterol. "Kilmer McCully's hypothesis seemed to challenge the cholesterol-heart hypothesis, which was riding high," says Irwin Rosenberg, director of the U.S.D.A. Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts University. Rosenberg was a medical-school classmate of McCully's and, briefly, a physician in Mass. General's department of medicine when McCully was in the department of pathology. "Because his work was not in vogue," Rosenberg says, "his insistence on what he was doing contributed to costing him his job."
Thomas N. James, a cardiologist and president of the University of Texas Medical Branch who was also the president of the American Heart Association in 1979 and '80, is even harsher. "It was worse than that you couldn't get ideas funded that went in other directions than cholesterol," he says. "You were intentionally discouraged from pursuing alternative questions. I've never dealt with a subject in my life that elicited such an immediate hostile response."
It took two years for McCully to find a new research job. His children were reaching college age; he and his wife refinanced their house and borrowed from her parents. McCully says that his job search developed a pattern: he would hear of an opening, go for interviews and then the process would grind to a stop. Finally, he heard rumors of what he calls "poison phone calls" from Harvard. "It smelled to high heaven," he says. "Eventually I went to an attorney friend of mine, someone quite prominent in Boston. He made a few phone calls and it was all over. Then this job came through."
The story of those two scary, free-fall years -- McCully can still recite the exact dates, Jan. 1, 1979, to March 15, 1981 -- emerges in small details, teased out by questioning. This is not a man who eagerly lays his grievances on the table. "My daughter told me recently that she still gets nightmares about that time," he says. Later, describing his son's and daughter's careers as, respectively, Wall Street banker and magazine editor, he remarks: "They both had been interested in chemistry when they were younger. Then they saw what happened to me" -- he barks a laugh -- "and that was the last I ever heard about that."
McCully also laughs with seeming good grace about the contrast between his present position and that of medical-school classmates like Irwin Rosenberg, "the director of the nutrition institute at Tufts, with a multimillion-dollar budget and all these projects." But from his much more modest perch at the Providence V.A. lab, he says, "I've been able to develop my own approach, which might not have been possible at a high-powered place."
 When McCully landed in Providence, he continued testing his theories, inducing arteriosclerosis in rabbits, observing homocysteine's effect on cancer cells and publishing his first monograph, an overview of the homocysteine theory. At the same time, a study at Cornell and several others in Europe -- in Sweden, Norway, the Netherlands and Ireland -- explored the workings of homocysteine in humans. By 1990, some of those results were beginning to pique fresh interest in the United States, and Meir Stampfer, a professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health, decided to take a look at homocysteine in members of the Physicians Health Study, an ongoing survey of almost 15,000 doctors. Stampfer's findings helped start the current surge in homocysteine research.
Using blood samples taken years before any of the physicians in the study developed heart disease, Stampfer and his colleagues found that homocysteine levels were directly correlated to heart-disease risk. "The study represented something of a turning point in the field," Stampfer says, "because it was the first time we had prospective data -- the men were healthy at the time the blood was drawn and some later became ill -- and also because the homocysteine levels were all basically in the normal range. Even within that range, being at the top was strongly predictive of heart disease."
Other powerful evidence soon followed. Jacob Selhub, a senior scientist and colleague of Irwin Rosenberg's at Tufts, looked at another large ongoing human sample, the Framingham Study, which has documented the population of Framingham, Mass., for nearly 50 years. Selhub found a strong association between homocysteine in the blood and insufficient levels of vitamins B6, B12 and folic acid. "We showed that 30 percent of the American population is not taking in enough folic acid," Selhub says. "And, at least in Framingham, close to 30 percent of the population has high homocysteine." Next, Selhub observed the relationship between homocysteine levels and narrowing, or stenosis, of the carotid artery. He found another correlation.
"The higher the homocysteine in the blood, the higher the prevalence of stenosis," Selhub says. "We also showed that people with low intake of folic acid and vitamin B6 have a higher chance of having stenosis in the carotid artery. That was very important and exciting -- that practically tells you that we might be able to prevent this if our folic acid intake was sufficient." Both of Selhub's articles on these landmark studies, which appeared in The Journal of the American Medical Association and The New England Journal of Medicine in 1993 and 1995 respectively, cited McCully's original 1969 article on homocysteine and arteriosclerosis in the very first sentence.
The homocysteine theory was back in business, and McCully with it. Even old-line supporters of the cholesterol theory now acknowledge that homocysteine is, if not entirely proven, an extremely promising area of research. "There's no question that homocysteine is a very important issue," says Claude Lenfant, director of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, which some scientists consider a kind of ground zero for the cholesterol camp.
"Even if only 10 percent of the risk of heart disease is explained by homocysteine," Rosenberg says, "you're talking about a huge element of the process of the disease -- and a lot of people. Forty-plus studies have so far observed a relationship between higher homocysteine levels and the risk of different kinds of vascular disease."
McCully appears to be enjoying the flowering of homocysteine with a minimum of bitterness. "Any scientist wants to have his work confirmed, wants to make a place for himself in the scientific literature," he says. "I thought it was great that these big shots were paying attention to it." Lenfant suggests that perhaps they would have paid more attention earlier if the cholesterol theory had been less divisive. "Twenty-five years ago, not everybody was accepting the cholesterol business," he says. "So who wanted to hear about something that perhaps would weaken the argument for cholesterol?"
 The cholesterol theory of heart disease, Thomas James says, "has been a favorite theory for 50 years." It holds, essentially, that high levels of cholesterol in the blood cause arteriosclerosis and heart disease and that lowering those levels will lower the risk of heart disease. But while it was easy to show that very high cholesterol was associated with a high risk of heart disease, it was harder to show how it caused heart disease, or whether reducing it would reduce heart disease. Recent studies have firmed up those relationships, according to Lenfant, who says, "Now the cholesterol story is as solid as the Rock of Gibraltar."
But there continue to be indications that the cholesterol story is extremely complex and sometimes contradictory. For instance, Stampfer says, "the majority of heart attacks occur in individuals with 'normal' cholesterol. That does not mean that cholesterol is not important, but it tells us that there are other mechanisms."
It has not always been easy to propose other mechanisms, perhaps because the cholesterol proponents themselves felt somewhat embattled. Throughout the 70's and early 80's, agencies like the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute and the American Heart Association were gearing up for major public health initiatives that culminated in the National Cholesterol Education Program begun in 1985, and the advocates for those agencies felt that a united front was essential.
Even as recently as last year, Alan Garber, an associate professor of medicine at Stanford University, was stunned after he and a colleague, Warren Browner, proposed that healthy young men and women need not be screened for cholesterol, since treatment at young ages has not been shown to be useful or cost effective. "The American Heart Association and the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute issued press releases and had a big campaign to discredit our work," Garber says.
McCully stresses that his ideas do not dismiss cholesterol as a risk factor, but they do question its hegemony. "Cholesterol is important, certainly," McCully says. "But the cholesterol theory isn't really a theory -- it's a collection of observations." He says his own theory suggests that "homocysteine might be the underlying cause of arteriosclerosis, that homocysteine damage sets the stage for cholesterol buildup in the arteries. I think altered homocysteine metabolism and biochemistry is at the heart of vascular disease.
"But," he adds with a laugh and a flash of self-knowledge, "working in this field all these years, naturally I feel that way."
As McCully knows well, history is crowded with examples of ostrich-like behavior among medical researchers. There was strong resistance for years to the idea that many ulcers are caused by a bacteria rather than stress -- a theory that was ridiculed until the evidence finally became too strong to dismiss.
The American scientific establishment's answer to such human foibles as stubbornness, arrogance and the unwillingness to let go of favored theories has been peer review. The peer-review system in research tries to be equitable by having panels of experts judge grant proposals and articles submitted to the medical journals. But even a process that has objectivity as its goal is vulnerable to the pitfalls of committee-think.
"For instance," Rosenberg says, "if most of the people on the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute's advisory council come out of the lipid-fat-cholesterol camp and there's no one from, say, a nutritional orientation, it's not as likely that an expensive study will get the same hearing if it's looking at a homocysteine-lowering intervention versus a cholesterol-lowering intervention."
James believes that as long as the management of the Heart, Lung and Blood Institute espouses the cholesterol line, "then the review committees, the other evaluating bodies, are going to be influenced -- not by written memoranda but by the environment and by word of mouth."
But James sees an even bigger reason for cholesterol's dominance of the heart-disease debate: "It's the money that's the problem. Look at the colorful advertisements in general-interest publications, explaining to grandfather that his grandchildren want him to stay alive using these drugs. The anti-cholesterol medications are multibillion-dollar industries now, and they have a huge stake in fanning the flames of the cholesterol mission."
Charles Hennekens, a professor at Harvard Medical School and chief of preventive medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital, cites the example of aspirin. "For years now, we've known about these large benefits of aspirin in treating acute heart attacks and survivors of heart attacks, and yet we have underutilization of it," he says. "At an F.D.A. advisory committee meeting recently, I joked that if aspirin were half as effective, 10 times as expensive and on prescription, maybe people would take it more seriously."
Like aspirin, the vitamins that control homocysteine levels are readily available, inexpensive and nonexclusive. "It's inescapable that there's just not the commercial interest for supporting research in homocysteine," Stampfer says, "because nobody's going to make money on it."
McCully takes this follow-the-money approach to its logical conclusion: who stands to gain? "The most dramatic improvements in longevity over the last couple of hundred years have been through public health, not through medicine," he says. "But public health is notoriously unprofitable. People don't make a profit preventing disease. They make a profit through medicine -- treating critical, advanced stages of disease."
 Although there's not much money to be made from doctors prescribing vitamins and offering dietary guidelines to heart-disease patients, corporate wheels are already turning to make homocysteine levels the latest, hottest measure of optimal health. A new TV commericial for Centrum multivitamins singles out folic acid because it "may help reduce homocysteine levels in the blood, an emerging risk factor for heart disease." McCully says that Abbott Laboratories has developed a test for homocysteine, though he feels it is inadequate. "Once we develop a better test," he says, "I would like to think that the vast majority of heart patients, far greater than the current estimates of 10 to 15 percent, will show this striking elevation in homocysteine."
Such confirmation may come years from now, and McCully realizes that he may not play a role in it. "Generally speaking, a scientist makes one contribution and then everybody else takes over and it becomes extremely competitive," he says. It is only when pressed about the past that McCully reveals, briefly, the shadow of disappointment that must have loomed larger two decades ago. "Last October," he says, "the pathology department at Mass. General had a reunion and invited me, and I saw one of the people involved in my leaving the department. 'Well,' he said to me, 'it looks like you were right after all.' It's 20 years later. My career is almost over. There's really not much that can be done about 20 lost years, is there?"
Worse, the political and economic forces that undid McCully back then may be more intense today. Last April, The New England Journal of Medicine published an article titled "The Messenger Under Attack -- Intimidation of Researchers by Special-Interest Groups," which detailed three cases of harassment by advocacy groups, physicians' associations or academic consultants who often failed to disclose their ties to drug companies. With more and more pressure groups weighing in on what research gets financed and promoted, the article said, "such attacks may become more frequent and acrimonious."

HEADLINE: The Big City;
Man With a Van

BYLINE: By John Tierney 

 BODY:
Vincent Cummins looks out from his van with the wary eyes of a hardened criminal. It is quiet this evening in downtown Brooklyn . . . too quiet.
"Watch my back for me!" he barks into the microphone of his C.B. radio, addressing a fellow outlaw in a van who just drove by him on Livingston Street. He looks left and right. No police cars in sight. None of the usual unmarked cars, either. Cummins pauses for a second -- he has heard on the C.B. that cops have just busted two other drivers -- but he can't stop himself. "Watch my back!" he repeats into the radio as he ruthlessly pulls over to the curb. 
 Five seconds later, evil triumphs. A middle-aged woman with a shopping bag climbs into the van . . . and Cummins drives off with impunity! His new victim and the other passengers laugh when asked why they're riding this illegal jitney. What fool would pay $1.50 to stand on the bus or subway when you're guaranteed a seat here for $1? Unlike bus drivers, the van drivers make change and accept bills, and the vans run more frequently at every hour of the day. "It takes me an hour to get home if I use the bus," explains Cynthia Peters, a nurse born in Trinidad. "When I'm working late, it's very scary waiting in the dark for the bus and then walking the three blocks home. With Vincent's van, I get home in less than half an hour. He takes me right to the door and waits until I get inside."
Cummins would prefer not to be an outlaw. A native of Barbados, he has been driving his van full time ever since an injury forced him to give up his job as a machinist. "I could be collecting disability," he says, "but it's better to work." He met Federal requirements to run an interstate van service, then spent years trying to get approval to operate in the city. His application, which included more than 900 supporting statements from riders, business groups and church leaders, was approved by the City Taxi and Limousine Commission as well as by the Department of Transportation. Mayor Giuliani supported him. But this summer the City Council rejected his application for a license, as it has rejected most applications over the past four years, which is why thousands of illegal drivers in Brooklyn and Queens are dodging the police.
Council members claim they're trying to prevent vans from causing accidents and traffic problems, although no one who rides the vans takes these protestations seriously. Vans with accredited and insured drivers like Cummins are no more dangerous or disruptive than taxis. The only danger they pose is to the public transit monopoly, whose union leaders have successfully led the campaign against them.
The van drivers have refuted two modern urban myths: that mass transit must lose money and that it must be a public enterprise. Entrepreneurs like Cummins are thriving today in other cities -- Seoul and Buenos Aires rely entirely on private, profitable bus companies -- and they once made New York the world leader in mass transit. The first horsecars and elevated trains were developed here by private companies. The first subway was partly financed with a loan from the city, but it was otherwise a private operation, built and run quite profitably with the fare set at a nickel -- the equivalent of less than a dollar today.
Eventually, though, New York's politicians drove most private transit companies out of business by refusing to adjust the fare for inflation. When the enterprises lost money in the 1920's, Mayor John Hylan offered to teach them efficient management. If the city ran the subway, he promised, it would make money while preserving the nickel fare and freeing New Yorkers from "serfdom" and the "dictatorship" of the "grasping transportation monopolies." But expenses soared as soon as government merged the private systems into a true monopoly. The fare, which remained a nickel through seven decades of private transit, has risen 2,900 percent under public management -- and today the Metropolitan Transportation Authority still manages to lose about $2 per ride. Meanwhile, a jitney driver can provide better service at lower prices and still make a profit.
"Transit could be profitable again if entrepreneurs are given a chance," says Daniel B. Klein, an economist at Santa Clara University in California and the co-author of "Curb Rights," a new book from the Brookings Institution on mass transit. "Government has demonstrated that it has no more business producing transit than producing cornflakes. It should concentrate instead on establishing new rules to foster competition." To encourage private operators to make a long-term investment in regular service along a route, the Brookings researchers recommend selling them exclusive "curb rights" to pick up passengers waiting at certain stops along the route. That way part-time opportunists couldn't swoop in to steal regular customers from a long-term operator. But to encourage competition, at other corners along the route there should also be common stops where passengers could be picked up by any licensed jitney or bus.
Elements of this system already exist where jitneys have informally established their own stops separate from the regular buses, but the City Council is trying to eliminate these competitors. Besides denying licenses to new drivers like Cummins, the Council has forbidden veteran drivers with licenses to operate on bus routes. Unless these restrictions are overturned in court -- a suit on the drivers' behalf has been filed by the Institute for Justice, a public-interest law firm in Washington -- the vans can compete only by breaking the law. At this very moment, despite the best efforts of the police and the Transport Workers Union, somewhere in New York a serial predator like Cummins is luring another unsuspecting victim. He may even be making change for a $5 bill.

 CORRECTION:
The Big City column on page 22 of The Times Magazine today describes the operation of Vincent Cummins, a van driver in Brooklyn. It reports that the City Council denied him a license to operate a commuter service in Brooklyn.
Mayor Giuliani vetoed the Council's action, and last week, after the Magazine had gone to press, the Council compromised by authorizing Mr. Cummins to pick up passengers by prearrangement. Mr. Cummins and other drivers are still suing for the right to compete with the M.T.A. along bus routes.

HEADLINE: Robert McNamara and the Ghosts of Vietnam

BYLINE: By David K. Shipler; David K. Shipler was a New York Times correspondent in Saigon from 1973 to 1975. His book "A Country of Strangers: Blacks and Whites in America" will be published in October.

 BODY:
Not long after dawn, Robert S. McNamara set out on a rapid walk through the half-light of Hanoi. A steamy drizzle soon soaked his dark blue jogging shorts and shirt. He stared intently ahead, barely glancing at the Vietnamese along the way as he marched in a loping stride through the city he ordered bombed some 30 years ago. He walked too quickly for the beggars or the barefoot children selling postcards to keep up with him. He did not seem to notice a boy hawking copies of "The Quiet American." He raced across currents of whizzing motorbikes and bicycles laden with impossibly huge bundles of fruit and shoes and large tin boxes, balanced as ingeniously as weapons had once been on the Ho Chi Minh Trail.
Peasant women in conical hats crisscrossed in front of him, moving gracefully beneath shoulder poles slung heavily with round baskets of bananas and litchi nuts. One woman squatting at the curb made an enticing gesture toward her pile of reddish litchis but got no reaction. He did not look into the faces of the people. He did not linger to gaze at their colorful wares. He was driven by another agenda, a mission he talked about incessantly as he walked. 
 In a few hours on this Friday in June, one of the more unusual efforts in the history of warfare was to begin. McNamara, three other former American officials, two retired generals and six historians would sit down with former North Vietnamese officials, diplomats, generals and scholars led by Nguyen Co Thach, a courtly former Foreign Minister, for a four-day discussion of what Americans call the Vietnam War and Vietnamese call the American War. Their main focus would be defined by McNamara's growing conviction that "each of us could have achieved our geopolitical objectives without that terrible loss of life," that both sides missed concrete chances to end the fighting during his tenure as Secretary of Defense from 1961 to 1968.
The thesis amounted to a confession of profound error, and this return to Vietnam -- McNamara's second since the war -- seemed likely to be a lonely journey into a regretful past. Despite his coterie of aging officials and younger historians, it was he above all who bore the burden. The others in the delegation had not conceived the war; they had worked at its margins, had followed orders or had tried to negotiate its end. With most of the war's key architects dead or declining to attend, McNamara stood as the only senior policy maker of the era to visit Hanoi and admit that the war should not have been fought and could not have been won. He wanted it studied as a cautionary tale for the next century. "Human beings have to examine their failures," he declared. "We've got to acquaint people with how dangerous it is for political leaders to behave the way we did."
If penance drove him to Hanoi, it was carefully concealed. The way McNamara examined his failure in Vietnam was to intellectualize it, diagnose it, pinpoint the variables that might have been revised. He was hoping that the Vietnamese would do the same, but they would frustrate him again, as they had 30 years before.
 Robert McNamara believes that American leaders acted out of honorable principles, as he argued in his 1995 book, "In Retrospect: The Tragedy and Lessons of Vietnam." "Yet we were wrong, terribly wrong," he wrote. "We owe it to future generations to explain why." This admission, which generated a mixture of admiration and vilification among Americans, earned him an enthusiastic welcome when he first visited Hanoi in November 1995. The quotation and his book are displayed in a museum in Ho Chi Minh City that features photographs of Americans torturing Vietnamese.
Now he had returned to Vietnam, not so much to test his thesis as to prove it. The title of the conference was a question: "Missed Opportunities?" But there was no question mark for McNamara. He was eager for Thach and the other Vietnamese to confirm what he believed he knew. The war had resulted in the reunified, Communist Vietnam that Hanoi had desired. But Vietnam had not become the agent of Soviet and Chinese Communism that Washington had feared; Communism in Indochina had not toppled the dominoes of Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and other Asian countries, as Dwight D. Eisenhower had wrongly predicted when he relinquished the Oval Office to John F. Kennedy in 1961. At that early stage, before the arrival of American combat troops in 1965, could the same ends have been realized at the bargaining table as, later, on the battlefield? Why did Hanoi repeatedly rebuff secret American attempts to open peace talks from 1965 to 1968? Why did the bombing of North Vietnam fail to force capitulation? And a key issue for McNamara: "If the United States had invaded North Vietnam, would the Chinese have intervened?" he asked. He had opposed the military chiefs' recommendations of an invasion because he feared China would enter the war; from the Vietnamese he would now seek vindication for that assessment.
McNamara talked as he walked briskly around the Lake of the Restored Sword at the heart of Hanoi. Had he known the legend of this lake in the 1960's, he would have understood the anti-Chinese thrust of Vietnam's historical devotion to independence. The story goes that in the 15th century, when the Ming Dynasty ruled Vietnam, a fisherman named Le Loi found in his net a magical sword that empowered him to lead his people in a 10-year struggle that drove the Chinese out in 1428. Le Loi became Emperor. As he then offered gratitude to the spirit of the lake, a giant golden tortoise snatched the sword and restored it to the depths.
Much of what the Vietnamese would try to explain to the Americans in the coming days touched on this mystical passion to be rid of foreign domination, whether by the Chinese for a thousand years, the French colonialists for more than a century, the Japanese during World War II or the Americans after the French defeat in 1954. It was the necessity of resisting the United States, the generals and diplomats in Hanoi would say, that drove North Vietnam into a temporary, pragmatic reliance on Chinese and Soviet aid.
"The basic lesson is: understand your opponent," McNamara concluded sorrowfully as he strode along the lake. The lesson worried him. "We don't understand the Bosnians, we don't understand the Chinese and we don't really understand the Iranians."
 It was more than intellectual interest that brought some of McNamara's colleagues to Hanoi. Unfinished business drew Chester L. Cooper, a veteran C.I.A. analyst, White House aide and State Department adviser who had been present at practically every fork in this rough road since the French war in Indochina in the early 1950's. He had been the point man in the Johnson Administration's secret, failed diplomacy of the mid-60's, running all over the world to send offers to the North Vietnamese. "Many of the names we will be confronting are names that I remember being these elusive, gray, unfriendly, unfathomable people whose attention I had been trying to get for several years," Cooper said before leaving for Hanoi. And he also sought something more personal. "How do these people feel about me walking around, going back to a place after you've destroyed it? How will they feel? How will I feel?"
Feelings were not on McNamara's agenda. "That's not what I'm focusing on," he declared before the trip. "I may not tell you how I'm feeling." And he never did, even when questioned about the thoughts that were running through his head as he walked around this city, among these people. "I try to separate human emotions from the larger issues of human welfare," he replied. "Human welfare requires that we avoid conflict. I try not to let my human emotions interfere with efforts to resolve conflict." It seemed an odd dichotomy, one that recalled McNamara's inability to invest his policy making with the compassion he may have felt.
Self-revelation was not the style of these aging men, now in their 70's and 80's. The Vietnamese, meanwhile, had been ordered in writing not to give interviews. "Stone statues" was how one American described the Vietnamese after the first day's discussions -- an image that mercifully broke down somewhat as time passed.
The Americans were less guarded. Cooper told the Vietnamese that he had resigned from the White House in quiet protest in 1966 and then agreed to work "on negotiations only" at the State Department until he concluded in December 1967 that the diplomatic feelers were "a charade." Nicholas deB. Katzenbach, who was Under Secretary of State from 1966 to 1969, had "some responsibility for negotiations," he said, "but there was always somebody around to sabotage them." Francis M. Bator, deputy national security adviser from 1965 to 1967, specialized in European affairs and only listened to Lyndon Johnson's anguished monologues about Vietnam. Gen. William Y. Smith, now retired from the Air Force, never served in Vietnam; as a major, he was an aide in the White House and for the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
The delegation's single combat veteran of the war was from the Army, Lieut. Gen. Dale Vesser, who is now retired, a sturdy man with a laconic style. From 1966 to 1971, he did two tours and several special missions in Vietnam. How did he feel being in Hanoi? "I have never had anything but respect for the people we fought," General Vesser said. "They were very good, and they were fighting for what they believed in. So being in Hanoi, other than feeling an obligation to those Americans who didn't come back, doesn't excite strong emotions."
Deciding to attend this conference brought Vesser considerable flak from colleagues in the Army, the service most badly wounded by the war and most bitter about McNamara and his book. At least half a dozen generals declined invitations. One of them, John H. Cushman, came close to going but then pulled out. A former brigade commander, he remembered the pain of returning to old battlefields a few years ago and meeting officers from the other side. "I'm just not comfortable being seated opposite these people exploring the missed opportunities," he said. "My constituency is my brigade. I think my constituency would not quite understand why I linked up with this effort to find out what we did wrong."
Something of the same concern made the trip to Hanoi unattractive to Gen. William Westmoreland, who commanded U.S. forces in Vietnam and who, at age 83, sounds as if he were frozen in time. "We did not lose a single battle against those people," he insisted. "They defeated us psychologically. I must say, I can just imagine the attitude of my troops when they read in the paper that the old man goes to Hanoi." To do so "would suggest that we're submitting to them, because we never lost a battle," he repeated. "It would be totally inappropriate for me as having led our troops to go and make homage to the enemy."
Walt W. Rostow, President Johnson's hawkish national security adviser, did not go because he anticipated that most of the information would come from American documents and memoirs. "I don't think that Hanoi's in a mood to give us anything equivalent, like the access to American policy in this period," he predicted. "After all, they are Communists. I don't want to join in an exercise that will be 90 percent American and 10 percent Hanoi." Furthermore, he added, "we were awfully well informed about them. I know all the answers to those questions."
The skepticism also infected foundations, 13 of which turned down requests for financial support, according to James G. Blight of Brown University's Thomas J. Watson Jr. Institute for International Studies, the American organizer of the meeting. Only the Rockefeller Foundation came through.
The doubts raised the stakes for the Hanoi meeting. The Americans, especially McNamara, were keen to prove the skeptics wrong by making sure the conference would succeed in opening up the secretive North Vietnamese decision-making process. The aim was to persuade the Vietnamese to break with their closed tradition and provide official documents from the period as well as personal recollections. The conference organizers provided voluminous background material from newly opened archives in Moscow, Washington, Eastern Europe and even Beijing, which included, for example, Chinese minutes of conversations in the 1960's between Mao Zedong and the North Vietnamese Prime Minister, Pham Van Dong.
Only Vietnamese documents were missing, and the Vietnamese organizer -- the Foreign Ministry's Institute for International Relations -- pledged early on to provide archival material. When a deadline passed in April without the promised papers having appeared, McNamara pounded the table at a Washington meeting of the American team and threatened not to go to Hanoi. "They have not met this condition!" he said. "I'm very skeptical that we can add to history unless we have documentary evidence. If we can't achieve that, I don't know if the conference should go forward." But he was bluffing, and in the end, no Vietnamese papers materialized.
That failure turned out to be a telling sign that the American skepticism about the conference was being echoed in Vietnam's corridors of power. Two weeks before the sessions, Hanoi rejected a proposal to hold daily, American-Vietnamese news briefings for fear that hard-liners in the Communist Party press would use them to attack the moderates who had organized the meeting. Then, hours after the American delegation arrived in Hanoi, the Vietnamese hosts at Hanoi's Institute for International Relations reneged on a longstanding agreement to allow CNN to tape the conference.
The development soured the atmosphere at first. McNamara fretted that the mood would be too guarded for candid discussion. The American team met alone to consider canceling the conference -- an empty threat with the entire delegation already in Hanoi. The Vietnamese then made a small compromise: CNN could get one of the four days on tape. And so went the negotiations about discussing 30-year-old attempts to start negotiations.
The nervousness about the TV camera reflected the uncertain boundaries of Vietnamese political discourse. Open debate on foreign or military policy is still taboo, especially on so sacred a topic as the war.
But acerbic complaints about the economy, which is increasingly geared to private enterprise and foreign investment, are now acceptable, and the police apparatus that once conducted block-by-block monitoring of ordinary residents in the former South Vietnam has been considerably relaxed. Political jokes are popular, and real life is often funnier. An irreverent young man who spent a year in prison after trying to escape by boat in the early 1980's recently received a surprise invitation: to join the Communist Party. He was amused, and he declined.
Vietnamese in political life, adrift in crosscurrents of ambiguous guidelines, must swim skillfully. Though the former Foreign Minister, Nguyen Co Thach, championed this conference, he sought to rein in his delegation. He often answered probing questions smilingly but with enigmatic single sentences. Sometimes he bluntly put subjects off-limits. When pushed to reveal what disagreements had existed among policy makers about negotiating with Washington, he said quietly, "There were discussions, but we are not permitted to publicize them." Because of Vietnam's long history of foreign domination, "our habit is to keep secrets in order to defend ourselves," he explained. "Sometimes we cannot even get access to our own secrets, so how can we share that with others?" Thus were McNamara's principal objectives foiled. But he soldiered on without evidence of despair, obsessed by the task of flushing information out of every hiding place.
It is a tricky time, as Vietnam casts one eye warily on China and the other expectantly on the United States and its powers of investment. The museum in Ho Chi Minh City that was once called the Museum of American War Crimes became the Museum of War Crimes and is now simply the Museum of War Remnants. Inside, however, the condemnation of America remains searing. On the one hand, the victory over the United States stands as a landmark of national heroism. On the other, with half its population having been born since the end of the war, Vietnam seems poised to move on. It has warmly welcomed Pete Peterson, the first American Ambassador to Hanoi and a former prisoner of war. In what seems apt symbolism, the prison where he was held, the "Hanoi Hilton," is being partly demolished for a luxury high-rise, with some outer walls of the prison to be retained as a monument. Peterson drives by two or three times a day, "and it doesn't bother me," he said, "which is good. It means I have healed."
Healing is usually easier for the victors than the vanquished, and the Vietnamese at the table displayed none of the Americans' anguish. As winners, they also seemed less impelled toward self-criticism. McNamara and the other Americans came to Hanoi eager to get the Vietnamese to admit that they, too, had made mistakes in failing to pursue policies that might have avoided or curtailed the war. But that would have amounted to an unimaginable confession that Vietnamese reunification and independence could have been won with less sacrifice. No national myth is shattered lightly.
 The Hanoi conferees met in a bright, cool room at the French-renovated Hotel Metropole, removed from the sultry streets. Reference books and papers were stacked and strewn before the participants, who wore earphones to hear the interpreters in windowed booths. The shape of the table was not an issue: it was a square, created from many long tables.
But there had been differences over the scope of the discussions. McNamara wanted to cover his term, 1961-68. The Vietnamese insisted on beginning in 1945, following the defeat of the Japanese in World War II. In the ensuing vacuum, they noted, Ho Chi Minh staked his claim for Vietnamese autonomy by including a passage from the American Declaration of Independence in his own declaration. They recalled his letter to President Truman -- unanswered -- seeking support for independence. Vietnam's most serious mistake, sardonically noted by Tran Quang Co, a former First Deputy Foreign Minister, came before 1945, when "we considered the U.S. a leading democratic country, which was opposed to colonialism," he said. "Therefore, we thought the U.S. would support our desire for independence. But we were wrong."
A quite different image of America had been fixed in the minds of the men around the table when the United States facilitated the return of French troops to re-establish France's colonies in Indochina, then provided financial and logistical support for the French in their unsuccessful war against the Viet Minh and then refused to sign the 1954 Geneva accords that called for Vietnamese elections. This was the picture of a colonialist power with "ambitions to become master of the world," said Thach, who from 1960 to 1975 was the North Vietnamese Foreign Ministry's chief specialist on the United States.
Woven into the harsh language was an instructive analysis of how misperceptions became reality. Co identified four mistaken images that shaped American behavior. First, when the 1954 accords divided Vietnam along a "provisional" line, Washington saw something more permanent, underestimating the drive for reunification. "We never had two Vietnams," Co declared. "We had only one Vietnam. But the U.S. assessed it as two Vietnams."
Second, the Americans "misjudged the nationalist character of the revolution," he said. McNamara had already made the same point, admitting that Washington "underestimated the nationalist aspect of Ho Chi Minh's movement. We saw him first as a Communist and only second as a Vietnamese nationalist."
Third, "the nature of the struggle was not to undermine neighboring countries," Co continued. "The U.S. failed to understand the objective of our war. It was only for our own national liberation and reunification." This negated the domino theory.
And finally, Washington "misjudged the relations between Vietnam on the one hand and China and the Soviet Union on the other." Co pointed out what has become especially obvious since the demise of the Soviet Union: Vietnam was not a tool of world Communism. The theme resounded passionately throughout the conference. It meant that the central premise of the American motivation to defend South Vietnam was false. If these concepts seemed like echoes from the past, they were. Much of what the Americans were being told, and were now accepting, the antiwar movement had argued 30 years before.
In his opening statement on Friday morning, McNamara conceded that American behavior after World War II had caused the Vietnamese to form misimpressions "that the United States' principal goal in Southeast Asia was to destroy the Hanoi Government and its southern ally, the N.L.F." -- the National Liberation Front, or Vietcong. But "we in the Kennedy Administration had no such view and no such aims in Vietnam," he insisted. "On the contrary, we believed our interests were being attacked all over the world by a highly organized, unified Communist movement, led by Moscow and Beijing, of which we believed -- I think incorrectly -- that the Hanoi Government of Ho Chi Minh was a pawn." He acknowledged having underestimated the Sino-Soviet rift.
The Vietnamese listened closely, but they seemed truly puzzled by the American obsession with the spread of Communism and sought more explanation. "If the reason was to fight Communism," they asked in a list of questions submitted beforehand, "why did the U.S. not help China in 1949, or why did the U.S. not help the Batista regime in Cuba in 1959?" They never got an answer, only a litany of conflicts, including two that nearly took the superpowers to war: the Berlin and Cuban missile crises of 1961 and 1962.
"We felt beset and at risk," McNamara said. "This fear underlay the Kennedy Administration's involvement in Vietnam." (A symmetrical domino theory gripped Moscow and Beijing, the American team had been told in Washington by Chen Jian, a Chinese scholar teaching in the United States. Newly obtained Soviet and Chinese documents reflected a fear that if North Korea or North Vietnam were lost, the Communist revolution could be reversed in Manchuria and perhaps all of China as well.)
Politely but pointedly, the Americans asked the Vietnamese to take some responsibility for their image. "If you believe that another country has a misperception about what you are trying to do," asked Katzenbach, the former Under Secretary of State, "my question is, What should you do to cure that misperception?" And later, adding that the domino theory was wrong but not irrational, he said: "I put myself in your place. The problem was, how would I, how would Vietnam, convince the United States that there was no domino theory?" Laughter but no answers came from the Vietnamese. Robert Brigham, an historian from Vassar, went on to point out that Chinese rhetoric in 1962 portrayed the N.L.F. as the first of many united fronts, "and nothing we saw coming out of Hanoi dissuaded us of that."
Once, Cooper turned the question around: "I would like to ask you if any mind-sets of Vietnam about the U.S. were wrong." A long silence followed. In private conversations later, the Vietnamese explained that the Foreign Ministry's sources of information on the United States had been limited to news summaries and issues of Time and Newsweek. They did not get any daily American newspapers, they said: a subscription to The New York Times was too expensive.
A couple of new facts emerged, not enough to revise the history books but sufficient for a lesson on how one side can read elaborate meaning into a coincidence and then react to the meaning rather than to the event itself. On Feb. 7, 1965, an American advisers' compound and airfield at Pleiku, South Vietnam, came under attack; eight Americans were killed and many more wounded. As Cooper explained to the Vietnamese generals across the table, Americans saw great significance in the timing. On that day, Cooper was in Saigon with McGeorge Bundy, the national security adviser at the time; they had been sent by President Johnson to assess the deteriorating military situation. Furthermore, on the same day the Soviet Premier, Aleksei Kosygin, was visiting Hanoi.
The choice of such a decisive moment to conduct the first specific attack on Americans was seen by Washington as a calculated policy move by Hanoi. In retaliation, the United States began its bombing raids on North Vietnam, which continued until the fall of 1968. Now Cooper wanted to know why Hanoi did it.
The answer came from Lieut. Gen. Dang Vu Hiep, a rotund, jolly-looking former deputy of the army's political department who was then stationed near Pleiku. "This was a spontaneous attack by the local commander" who acted under general orders to treat the South Vietnamese Army and its American advisers as equal enemies -- "no discrimination," he remarked with a smile. The assault, by 30 commandos, had been planned long in advance, he explained, but the timing was coincidental. No specific instructions for the attack came from Hanoi, and "we did not know Bundy was in Saigon," he insisted. "We were just attacking, so we had no reason to criticize our people for attacking. They got first-class medals." Since the Russians were trying to restrain Hanoi from fighting in the south, Kosygin "was not pleased, but he couldn't say anything," General Hiep added during a break.
Had the role of the local commander been known at the time, Washington would have seen the incident differently, both Cooper and McNamara conceded. "I think we'd have put less weight on it and put less interpretation on it as indicative of North Vietnam's aggressiveness," McNamara said. The same held for the Aug. 2, 1964, assault by North Vietnamese patrol boats on the American destroyer Maddox in the Tonkin Gulf, McNamara added. That, too, was the initiative of a local commander, according to Gen. Nguyen Dinh Uoc, who heads the Institute of Military History. The alleged second Tonkin Gulf attack, on Aug. 4, never occurred, McNamara had been told by Gen. Vo Nguyen Giap, the military commander of North Vietnam during the war, in November 1995. At the time, the supposed attack had been used by President Johnson to secure a Congressional resolution providing broad authority for military action. Such details were mere footnotes, however, since the Vietnamese and American historians agreed that Washington would have found another pretext to bolster the decaying position of the Saigon Government.
Luu Doan Huynh, a Vietnamese scholar, came as close as anyone to giving McNamara what he wanted on China's probable response to an American invasion of North Vietnam. But the answer came in the form of analysis, not documentary evidence, and so it remained inconclusive. The Vietnamese were asked to supplement what had been learned from Chinese documents about a secret 1965 meeting in which Ho Chi Minh won from Mao Zedong a commitment to send Chinese troops in case of an American invasion. Nguyen Co Thach replied curtly: "I have no evidence. Thank you."
Huynh went on to explain that China regarded north Vietnam as part of a buffer zone within its sphere of influence. "So China made adequate preparations," he said. "There was an agreement" under which thousands of Chinese engineering troops were stationed in North Vietnam to help with road construction. "They displayed their equipment for you to see from the air," he remarked. "The Chinese factor was a deterrent, but that did not mean we were very eager to use it. We wanted to fight you alone."
The answer resolved nothing. "Hanoi's top leadership asked for and received commitments," Brigham said later. "It is not clear that China intended to follow through on those commitments."
 Robert McNamara is still something of the systems analyst he was as a statistical control officer during World War II, as president of the Ford Motor Company, as Secretary of Defense and then as president of the World Bank. On his morning walks he calibrates his pace to four miles an hour and was pleased one rainy day to discover, on a hotel treadmill, how many calories he could burn. During the war he was so impressed by the logic of statistics that he tried to calculate how many deaths it would take to bring North Vietnam to the bargaining table. Now he wanted to know why his reckoning had been wrong, why the huge casualties that he had helped inflict had failed to break the will of the men in Hanoi. He came and left with the most durable stereotype between enemies: that the other side is a people not sufficiently swayed by loss of life.
His ruminations about this began at the Americans' April meeting in Washington, where he, Cooper and General Vesser agreed that casualties did not seem to weigh heavily with North Vietnam, either in diplomacy or military planning. "Was there any consideration of the human cost in Hanoi as they made these decisions?" McNamara asked. "Is the loss of life ever a factor?" He noted that while 58,000 Americans had been killed, the most authoritative estimate -- in a September 1995 article by General Uoc -- put the number of Vietnamese deaths at 3.6 million. "It's equivalent to 27 million Americans!" McNamara exclaimed.
To explain this to himself, he remembered seeing, during World War II in China, a worker fall and get crushed by a huge roller flattening earth for an airfield. The Chinese laborers laughed. There were some people to whom life was not the same as to us, he reasoned as he stood one evening in the hotel lobby. "We'd better understand that and write it down."
"Were you influenced by that loss of life?" he asked in the conference. "Did it move you to probe the negotiations?" Considering that a man responsible for so many casualties was accusing his enemies of caring less, the Vietnamese responded with exceeding courtesy. At first, when McNamara asked Thach the question over lunch, "the answer was, They paid no attention whatever to the casualties," McNamara reported triumphantly. "What I thought was -- and I was wrong -- that a very high rate of casualties would lead them to be interested in trying to find a less costly way of achieving their objectives -- i.e., negotiations." But all he had got was the standard line that the cause was worth any sacrifice, based on the often-quoted mantra of Ho Chi Minh: "There is nothing more precious than freedom and independence."
If a second question was asked -- did you do anything to minimize casualties? -- the conversation suddenly opened onto a different level, beneath the propaganda. A colonel at the Army Museum in Hanoi, for example, explained to me how he had lived for months in narrow tunnels underground, how units would attack where the enemy was weak, fall back where it was strong, use the fewest men and weapons possible for the task and "hold you by the belt," which meant staying so close to American troops that they could not call in air strikes or artillery without risking self-inflicted casualties.
McNamara did not travel more than a few blocks from the Hotel Metropole, or he would have seen that virtually every village has a monument to the fallen; indeed, one junior Government official, pointing to a new monument under construction, complained that the money could be better spent supporting survivors of the slain. And a major topic of press coverage and conversation is the belief that Agent Orange caused birth defects in children of soldiers.
When the Vietnamese officials across the table tuned in to what McNamara was trying to say, they parried firmly. "If Mr. McNamara thought that the leaders of Vietnam did not pay attention to the losses and suffering of the Vietnamese people while continuing the war," Co said, "this is a mistake, a misunderstanding by the United States, which is terribly wrong. The war did happen on Vietnamese soil. We suffered a thousand times more than the U.S. did." Then he delivered a final thrust: "I thank you, Mr. McNamara, for giving us more understanding of your country."
McNamara remained baffled by Hanoi's failure to respond to Washington's negotiating probes, which included at least seven feelers put out by the Johnson Administration from 1965 to 1968 through Norwegian, Canadian, Polish, Soviet and other intermediaries, and at direct American-North Vietnamese meetings in Paris, Moscow and Rangoon. Usually these were accompanied by halts in the bombing of North Vietnam, during which the White House made known its expectation that Hanoi would curtail the flow of troops and weapons to the south. But the flow, not easy to control precisely, seemed to continue or to increase. And on the American side the bombing was sometimes resumed at inopportune moments -- either because the weather cleared and permitted previously approved targets to be hit (as McNamara reports in his book) or because the White House refused to postpone a strike (as Cooper complained).
The Americans were intensely curious to know why Hanoi had not taken up the negotiating offers. In one instance it seemed as mundane as a misunderstanding over an appointment in Warsaw. The American version has been widely published: on Dec. 6, 1966, the American Ambassador to Poland, John Gronouski, was scheduled to meet with the North Vietnamese Ambassador to receive a reply to a proposal for talks. Gronouski waited in the office of the Polish Foreign Minister, Adam Rapacki, but the Vietnamese envoy did not show up. For 30 years this has been interpreted as a rebuff.
But at the conference, a retired Vietnamese diplomat, Nguyen Dinh Phuong, gave another version. He had been dispatched from Hanoi to Warsaw for the meeting, he said. He had arrived on Dec. 3 (a day that bombing was resumed) and waited with his ambassador at the North Vietnamese Embassy on Dec. 6. "We waited the whole day," he said, "but the U.S. Ambassador did not show up. On the 7th, the U.S. bombed more forcefully in downtown Hanoi. We concluded that the U.S. did not want to have negotiations."
Other answers were much less specific than the historians had hoped for but vividly illuminated the clash of perceptions. The Vietnamese doubted the sincerity of the negotiating offers, which they saw as propaganda ploys to mollify domestic and international criticism, to picture the Johnson Administration as peacemaker and Hanoi as warmonger. McNamara pounded the table and insisted that "many, I would say most" overtures were not "primarily" for propaganda. But how was anyone at the time to know? The men in Hanoi had been as ignorant as the American public of McNamara's growing doubts in 1966 and 1967 that the war could be won. They interpreted the use of intermediaries, as opposed to direct contacts, as part of the public-relations campaign to convince other countries of Washington's supposedly peaceful intentions. "We used intermediaries because we couldn't get to you," Coop-er countered. But the suspicion was heightened by the Administration's failure to take up Vietnamese initiatives, including a four-point negotiating plan from Prime Minister Pham Van Dong.
Alert to what Washington did rather than what it said, the North Vietnamese interpreted each bombing halt as a "smoke screen" hiding further escalation. "For these peace initiatives to be convincing," Co remarked, they "should not have been conducted in the context of escalating war, in the context of increasing bombing against the north, in the context of the massive introduction of U.S. troops in the south. We interpreted those peace initiatives as war efforts, not genuine peace efforts." When President Johnson proposed aid for reconstruction as part of a peace plan, the North Vietnamese felt he was trying to "buy our surrender" by giving sweets, Luu Doan Huynh said. "If you don't like these sweets, you'll be eaten!"
McNamara pressed the Vietnamese on why they showed no interest in a 1967 offer of a cease-fire, an American withdrawl and reunification. "Was anything better than that obtained in 1973, six years later, after hundreds of thousands additional killed?" he asked. "I think not."
"We could not enter into negotiations under the pressure of bombing," Thach replied.
The North Vietnamese felt bludgeoned and blackmailed and dishonored by the bombing, but rather than weakening their will, the officials and generals at the table said, it had actually forged resilience. Yet they demanded a permanent bombing halt as a precondition for negotiations, and once they got it in the fall of 1968, they opened the Paris talks in 1969 with the Nixon Administration, which led to the 1973 agreement on American withdrawal. Negotiations result when "either party realizes it cannot win on the battlefield," commented Nguyen Khac Huynh, a former Deputy Foreign Minister.
That was why two of the American historians, George C. Herring of the University of Kentucky and Charles E. Neu of Brown, were skeptical that negotiations could have succeeded in the mid-1960's. Outside the conference room, Neu noted that anyone who pushed negotiations then was marginalized by the Johnson White House and that McNamara became the ultimate example. Herring agreed. "We need Walt Rostow here," he said, "because he would correct McNamara's view about where negotiations could go, which is way too optimistic."
Could negotiations have been successful when the United States had not yet resigned itself to a reunified Vietnam under Hanoi's control? "No," Cooper said. "I think they would have been long, heart-rending, ulcer-producing, frustrating." As for McNamara, "I don't know if he's revising history, but he's asking a lot of history."
But McNamara stuck to his conviction that had he known what he now knew, and had President Johnson grabbed the issue of Vietnam as insistently as he had the civil-rights issue, a negotiated solution could have been found.
Lyndon Johnson stayed in Vietnam largely because he feared the reaction from the right if he lost the war, his aide Francis Bator explained. The "central mission of his Presidency," Bator said, was getting the Civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act, Medicare and other Great Society programs through a dubious Congress, and he did not think he could risk being seen as irresolute on Communism. "He was deeply gloomy about the war throughout," Bator told the Vietnamese on the final day. "I believe that during 1966-68 he would have happily accepted a negotiating process." Bator was struck by the symmetry of error. "Our mistakes and your mistakes caused both of us to suffer dearly."
 At the end, the Americans were taken to a frustrating meeting with General Giap, the short, gray-haired master military strategist, who gave a propaganda lecture lasting more than an hour, ignoring McNamara's pleas for answers to substantive historical questions submitted beforehand. "You're certainly winning the war of words," McNamara said through a brave smile. The same thing happened three days earlier with Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam, who had stonewalled questions in favor of a polemic about American misdeeds. This so annoyed Cooper that he scribbled a note: "This gives me deja vu: 1954, 1961, 1970. Enough already!" But on balance, Cooper said later, "I'm awfully glad I came. It closes the loop for me. I admire their guts."
By the end of the conference, McNamara pronounced the meetings a successful first step in examining the war. It was hard not to admire his relentless spirit of inquiry. But his attractive trait of self-criticism and his faith in the power of knowledge weigh against the memory of what he did, the criticism he screened out at the time, the facts he refused to consider in his policy making. Now he was willing to accept blame, but he also sought to spread the guilt around, to extend the circle of error to the North Vietnamese. They were not ready to play that game. "Of course," Co countered at the closing news conference, "the opportunities were missed by the U.S. side, not by the Vietnamese side." McNamara came back: "I don't think they were all missed by the U.S."
On that discordant note, and immediately after the unsatisfying session with General Giap, McNamara rushed to catch a plane. He was flying to New York for a meeting to discuss anticorruption efforts in Africa. "I'm tilting at windmills all over the world," he chuckled. Then he planned to go mountain climbing in Colorado.
"I think McNamara is a delicate personality, despite his mountain climbing," Cooper said. "He's running fast so the ghosts don't catch him," said another American, paraphrasing an observation made by others who have watched him.
In the streets of Hanoi, McNamara's lean frame, slightly bent, looked sinewy or fragile. One could not be certain. He is 81, and he is hurrying through the twilight.

 Ecology and Wonder
 in the Last Wilderness.
 By Paul Schullery.

 The creation of Yellowstone National Park in 1872 is so symbolic to the conservation and environmental movements that it seems surprising its anniversary isn't celebrated annually. But every 25 years may be enough, considering the outpouring of affection, analysis, introspection and blather that accompanies each such occasion.
Yellowstone, a great hunk of Western wild land set aside as a park by a Congress that had no idea what it was doing, and managed by a succession of sincere and hopeful people who to this day are not sure what they have done, defies analysis. That hasn't stopped writers from trying to explicate the park's significance -- as a symbol of environmental consciousness, of ecosystem management, of tourist awe and destructiveness or of fire suppression policy, among other things. This year's 125th anniversary is sure to generate a similar gush. Fortunately, at least two fine and almost blather-free books have emerged: "A Yellowstone Album," a charming collection of historic photographs, and Paul Schullery's thoughtful and happily nonpolemical essay on its management history.
The book of black-and-white photographs is a straightforward collection, evocative more of the quirky styles of camping, engineering, architecture and clothes that people brought to Yellowstone than of the piece of wilderness itself. The commentary, by Lee H. Whittlesey, a park historian, and other Yellowstone staff members, is too brief to allow new insight, but the collection itself, which includes striking images of early crowds, now-forbidden pastimes like bear feeding, and the legendary rangers, offers a comprehensive look at the intensity of human activity in the park almost from the day of its creation.
Schullery's book, which has its own scattering of historic images, is more thought-provoking, and more in tune with the sense in the environmental movement that Yellowstone is a cornerstone of preservation whose fate foreshadows the earth's. Luckily, Schullery doesn't take the occasion to pontificate. Instead he uses a historian's detached sensibility to deflate popular myths, dismantle teetering theories and, without giving up his obvious personal awe at the place, paint its human history in realistic tones. I knew I had come upon something good when, near the beginning of the book, he took on the notion, which I encounter too often in places where crystals hang in windows, that pre-European America was a land of mystical natural balance. "There is a lingering feeling that things were somehow right back then," he writes, "that some fundamental state of harmony existed between humans and the rest of nature. . . . The concept of North America as Eden just doesn't hold up under careful scrutiny."
Schullery likes careful scrutiny. His book is fatal to other popular ideas and legends, such as the oft-repeated sentimental story that Yellowstone as a park was conceived in an altruistic campfire conversation by a group of explorers in 1870. Instead, he writes, the concept of the park evolved from European ideas, the earlier protection of Yosemite Valley and careful promotion by a railroad company eager to carry tourists west.
These deflations don't stop with the distant past; in his careful way Schullery knocks the pins out from under some of the most intemperate arguments over management of elk herds offered by Alston Chase in his 1986 book "Playing God in Yellowstone," and shows the complications behind a heated recent controversy over the brucellosis scare that led to the killing of at least 700 bison at Yellowstone's edges. Elk, he points out, can also carry brucellosis, but no one demands that they be shot at the border.
Schullery seems most interested not in the way things ought to be but by how amazingly complex things are -- and how hard they are to manage: "One hundred and twenty-five years ago we inherited this great humming thing, with its sprawling network of habitats and episodes . . . its irresistible momentum for change. . . . Ever since then we have imagined ourselves wise enough to control it and have rushed to judge what is wrong with it. And every time we looked hard enough, we discovered that there was more wrong with our judgment than with Yellowstone."
It is understandable that Schullery (unlike Chase) bears no grudge against the Park Service; he's worked in the agency at Yellowstone as ranger, historian, administrator and editor on and off for 25 years. Sometimes this shows to the book's detriment. Thinking we know all about them, he doesn't tell us enough about some of the big events in the park's history -- its importance in the creation of the National Park Service, for instance, or the political uproar after the fires of 1988. On these occasions the book sounds like the continuation of a long in-house discussion rather than something the rest of us can instantly grasp. But even in these obscure moments he reminds me of the best environmental bureaucrats I've met, people whose regular contacts with angry polemicists from many sides have made them cautious, thoughtful, fact-driven scientists of compromise.
These traits, which I suspect Schullery brought to his job rather than the other way around, add valuable calmness and clarity to the continuing discussion of what Yellowstone means to us and how we should treat it. Late in his story, in describing the recent dispute over the proposal for a gold mine just outside the park, which drew President Clinton's personal attention and was resolved with a land trade, Schullery refers wryly to "the magnificently urgent hyperbole of Yellowstone debates." In "Searching for Yellowstone" he has given us a refreshingly unhyperbolic look at the place he loves, and has thus notably honored its beauty, its mystery, its people, its past -- and its future.

HEADLINE: A Mere 50 Years of Freedom

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS; JOHN F. BURNS is chief of the New Delhi bureau of The Times.

 BODY:
THE 50th anniversary of India's independence in August 1947 was still a couple of years away when the American Ambassador to India, Frank G. Wisner, hit on an idea he took to P. V. Narasimha Rao, who was then the country's Prime Minister. If India were to use the occasion as a vehicle for celebrating democracy, Mr. Wisner suggested, the United States would lend its support, and organize events of its own that would hail India's tradition of electing its Governments.
Mr. Rao, who once told an interviewer that he would like to be remembered for perfecting the art of what he called "masterly inactivity," was not galvanized. According to an aide to Mr. Wisner, who left New Delhi in July to begin a new career in New York, the Indian leader, then 74 years old, regarded the American envoy balefully, then passed on to other matters. "It looked as though Rao was saying to himself, 'What on earth is this fellow talking about?' " the ambassador's aide recalled. 
 For Mr. Rao, the issue was not so much celebrating democracy as finding ways to hang on to his job, a struggle he lost in the general election of May 1996. Since then, Indian politics has been a revolving door, with three other men serving as Prime Minister. With the constant threat of following Mr. Rao into political oblivion, none has had much time to think largely about India's half-century as an independent nation, or about ways the anniversary could be used to renew the spirit of men like Mohandas K. Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru, who led India to what Mr. Nehru called its "tryst with destiny" at midnight on Aug. 14, 1947.
As an occasion for a party, the anniversary that begins Thursday looks like something of a bust, to the extent that the committee responsible for organizing the celebration was forced to announce, with only weeks to go to the anniversary, that it was shifting the calendar and declaring the August date to be the beginning, not the culmination, of the anniversary year. As for events over the next 12 months, the committee has so far been vague, saying that while it will be staging cultural and other events that give the anniversary a national flavor, it expects the celebrations to be organized mainly by the 25 Indian states and in the country's 650,000 villages.
As for the moment of independence, when Mr. Nehru electrified his countrymen with a speech of soaring eloquence ("A moment comes, which comes but rarely in history, when we step out from the old to the new, when an age ends, and when the soul of a nation, long suppressed, finds utterance. . ."), the organizing committee, led by the current Prime Minister, Inder Kumar Gujral, has planned a midnight ceremony on Thursday, to be held, like the 1947 event, in the central hall of India's Parliament.
There, lawmakers will observe a minute's silence in memory of those who died in the struggle for freedom, and listen to a scratchy tape recording of Nehru's 1947 speech. They will also hear a recording of a speech by Gandhi -- ironic, in its way, since Gandhi absented himself from the proceedings in New Delhi, choosing to spend the day fasting in Calcutta. Gandhi, who had opposed until almost the last moment the partition of British India into the separate nations of India and Pakistan, said at the time that he found nothing to celebrate in the moment of independence.
Many think that Gandhi would find little to celebrate in the country's current state, with levels of poverty, illiteracy, disease and corruption that mock many of the Mahatma's hopes for his country. But India's political malaise is not the only reason the country has not so far been seized with the enthusiasm and nostalgia that, say, marked Allied nations' celebration of the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II. Unlike Westerners, Indians are not much inclined to celebrate anniversaries of any kind, and in any case, for a people who trace their civilization back 4,000 years, 50 years can seem but a blink in time.
Still, India's seeming lack of enthusiasm is no reason for others not to find their own ways of marking the birth of a nation that was a watershed not only for India, but for the world as well. India was, after all, the first, and the most populous, of the dozens of countries that broke free from colonialism in the post-war era, and it was, and still is, a bellwether for free peoples in the poorer parts of the earth. Nelson Mandela, freed from 27 years in South African prisons, made one of his first overseas trips to India, telling audiences here that his struggle had been profoundly influenced by India's example.
As legatees of the modern world's first great freedom struggle, Americans, too, have much in India's anniversary to celebrate and something, too, in which to take pride, since American pressures, including some that were applied by President Franklin D. Roosevelt during his wartime meetings with Winston Churchill, played their own part in persuading Britain's postwar government to end the British Raj. There is, too, the fact that the 1990's have seen a turn toward the congenial relations between India and the United States that seemed natural in 1947, but that evaporated amid the tensions that accompanied India's alliance with the Soviet Union, and the United States' ties with Pakistan, during the Cold War.
THE improving relationship has been accompanied by rising numbers of American visitors to India, who have recovered from the shock of the plague scare of 1994, and are once more crowding the country's overstretched hotels, planes and trains during the October-through-April high season. Partly because of the anniversary, which is drawing attention to India in many Western countries that have organized their own festivals and seminars, the tourist season that will begin once the current monsoons end in September is expected to be the busiest ever.
Although this may mean more than the usual difficulty in making reservations in the best hotels, it may not be too serious a problem for travelers who would like to take the independence anniversary as their motif. For them, the absence of grand events, the fact that this is to some extent a birthday without party, cake or candles, can also be a liberation. For the history being marked is accessible almost anywhere a visitor travels, not only in the museums and sites that can be found in any good guidebook, but also in the living testimony that is offered by Indians themselves to the instinct for freedom that found expression in 1947.
For while democracy may be going through a rough passage in New Delhi and the state capitals, the democratic spirit elsewhere is thriving. A visitor who stops in any teahouse, or on any village corner, soon finds that India's political institutions rest on a sure foundation, the determination of everyman to have his say.
One old India hand, A. M. Rosenthal, columnist for The New York Times, rediscovered this on a recent visit to a village in a remote corner of Uttar Pradesh, the northern state with a population of 140 million people that is a crucible of the country's woes. When his host, the local maharajah, invited villagers to the palace grounds for a town meeting, what ensued was a free-for-all -- the villagers' vociferous litany of government failures, in health care, education and the economy -- that would be unimaginable, say, in China.
The experience is one any visitor can replicate, even without an interpreter, since it is a rare moment in India when there is nobody who can speak English. Equally, despite levels of poverty that have small children banging on car windows at urban traffic lights for small change, there are few places that travelers visit in India, outside of Kashmir and other border regions affected by separatist uprisings, where they will be at any appreciable risk. Even theft is relatively unusual, with the poorest of Indians often quick to return a dropped wallet or a mislaid bag.
Foreigners arriving unheralded in a village, or clambering aboard an overcrowded train, will generally be overwhelmed by generosity, goodwill and good humor. These qualities rarely flag, even when the subject is the two centuries of British rule, known as the Raj. Although most Indians are keenly aware of the indignities and deprivations, few nowadays speak disparagingly of the British, while many recall the better things they bequeathed -- the world's most extensive railways, an elaborate administrative system that made governing such a vast country possible, the rule of law, and perhaps especially cricket, an Indian passion.
For those who would like a more tangible experience of what Indians call their freedom struggle, the choices are endless. New Delhi is an obvious starting point, although the place that saw much of the crucial action in the months before independence, the former palace of Britain's Viceroys, now known as the Rashtrapati Bhavan, or Presidential Palace, is not normally open to the public except by special application. (For a brief period in the spring visitors are admitted to the gardens.) It was in this magnificent red sandstone edifice, between March and August 1947, that Lord Louis Mountbatten, the last of the Viceroys, negotiated with Nehru, Gandhi and Mohammed Ali Jinnah, the Muslim leader, on the terms that led to the partition and independence.
THREE other houses in New Delhi are rich in associations with the independence movement. At the Birla House, a whitewashed industrialist's mansion in the leafy part of New Delhi that Britain developed for the residences of its senior officials, visitors can pause at the site where Gandhi was assassinated by a Hindu nationalist, Nathuram Godse, on Jan. 30, 1948. Now a museum, the house includes the Spartan room where Gandhi spent his last night, and footsteps, picked out in concrete, that follow his last walk out into the garden. Nearby is Teen Murti Bhavan, Mr. Nehru's official residence during his 17 years as Prime Minister, now a museum, with a bedroom only slightly more indulgent than Gandhi's, as well as a study and reception room preserved as they were in Mr. Nehru's time.
Another short walk away, at 1 Safdarjung Road, is the residence where Nehru's daughter, Indira Gandhi, Prime Minister for 15 years, was assassinated by Sikh security guards as she walked through the garden in October 1984. The house is preserved as a museum to Mrs. Gandhi and to her son, Rajiv Gandhi, her successor as Prime Minister, who was killed by a Sri Lankan Tamil suicide bomber in May 1991 while electioneering outside Madras. A few miles away, on the banks of the Yamuna River, are the ghats, or cremation sites, where Gandhi, Mr. Nehru, his daughter and his grandson were placed atop sandalwood pyres, and are remembered now with memorials.
But perhaps the greater pleasure lies in visiting the places where the freedom struggle was fought and won. A traveler could spend months following the traces, but a few sites stand out. In Amritsar, near the Pakistan border 250 miles northwest of Delhi, there is the Jallianwala Bagh, now a memorial garden, where a British general, R. E. Dyer, ordered troops to open fire on a protest gathering in April 1919, killing some 400 people and wounding hundreds more, and lending momentum to the freedom movement that was never lost.
In Allahabad, 350 miles southeast of Delhi, an ancient city on the Ganges that retains much of its old elegance and charm, is the Anand Bhavan, the magnificant verandahed mansion that was the family home of the Nehrus. Given to the nation by Mrs. Gandhi, who grew up there, this house, too, may be seen by visitors much as the family left it, with simple bedrooms and the book-lined study where Gandhi, Nehru and other Congress Party leaders held crucial strategy sessions.
For those especially interested in Gandhi, there is Ahmedabad, 450 miles southwest of Delhi, headquarters for the Mahatma after he returned from South Africa in 1915, and site of the Sabarmati Ashram where he taught his followers. Here, and in Gandhi's home nearby, where his spinning wheel, desk and personal belongings remain, visitors can capture the Spartan simplicity of his life style. It was from the ashram, in March 1930, that Gandhi set out to walk 240 miles to the Arabian Sea at Dandi, where he and his followers symbolized resistance to British rule by making salt, defying colonial laws that imposed taxes on saltmaking and other indigenous industries.
Just about every city and town has its own statue, memorial or museum. But Gandhi himself would almost certainly have told visitors to India in the golden jubilee year of its independence to seek the heart of the country where he found it, in the villages where three-quarters of the population still lives. If it is part of free India's failure that too little has been done to alleviate the grinding hardships of its poorest people, it is also part of the country's allure that the simple, down-to-earth life of many has been left largely untouched, accessible to anyone with time and energy to seek it out.

Pairing State and U.S. Aid for Low-Income Housing

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE

 BODY:
OVER the next year or so a vacant bakery in East Orange, a burnt-out monastery begun in 1861 in Union City and a patch of bayfront land in North Wildwood are to be reborn as rental housing for low-income families.
All three are among the 13 projects whose developers took advantage of Federal low-income tax credits under the latest round allocated by the state. Many also received state grants. 
 In exchange for the public subsidies the apartments will be rented at prices affordable to people earning 50 to 60 percent of their area's median income.
So far this year, a total of $17.2 million in state grants and Federal credits has been awarded to the projects, which will produce 784 such units, according to the New Jersey Housing Mortgage Finance Agency. The agency, the semipublic arm of the Department of Community Affairs, allocates the state's share of the tax credits.
The Community Affairs Department provided $8.7 million in grants through its Neighborhood Preservation Balanced Housing Program. Funds for that program are provided by a portion of the 5 percent state realty-transfer tax charged on the sale of any home for $150,000 or more.
New Jersey officals have said that pairing state funds with Federal credits in a single project, rather than allocating them separately, has proven effective in creating sound housing affordable to low-income tenants at a time of scarce public financing.
Along with housing, many of the projects contain retail and/or social-service components for their residents as well as for others in the area.
The 13 projects, spread among urban and suburban neighborhoods, will serve both families, in such developments as those in East Orange and Union City, and the elderly, in developments such as the one in North Wildwood.
They will also serve people with special needs. A case in point is the conversion planned for a 48-room shelter for the homeless on Bergen Avenue in Jersey City into 18 apartments for homeless single mothers who are victims of domestic violence.
"We are taking a coordinated look to see how projects fit into the overall communities," said Jane M. Kenny, Commissioner of the Department of Community Affairs, adding that it was hoped that they will cause a ripple effect in economic development.
The construction of the 13 projects will bring to 13,000 the number of low-income rentals built in the state, thanks mainly to the tax-credit program, which began in 1987. The program -- which allocates tax credits to individual states on a $1.25 per capita basis -- is the nation's main subsidy for producing such housing.
New Jersey has been receiving an average of about $9.7 million a year.
The state allocates the credits to developers -- who apply for them on a competitive basis -- to help them finance their projects. The credits then are sold to corporations or wealthy individuals, who provide cash needed for construction and use the value of the credits to reduce Federal, personal or corporate taxes. In some cases, the buyers get an income stream from the projects.
Tax credits, which must be taken in equal amounts over 10 years, are sold to investors at a discount. They now range from 65 to 70 cents on the dollar.
By reducing construction costs through the sale of tax credits, the developer is able to lease apartments at lower rents. The units must be reserved for low-income tenants for at least 15 years and rents are capped at 30 percent of income.
"Without the credits it would be extremely difficult to produce affordable rentals," said Timothy J. Touhey, executive director of the mortgage-finance agency, adding that he got three times more applications for projects than he was able to accommodate.
The East Orange project, Bakery Village, was awarded $1.49 million in tax credits and a $2.16 million state grant. In turn its developer, RPM Development of Montclair, will recycle the 250,000-square-foot former bakery on Fourth Avenue (it made Tip Top bread) into 125 rentals. It will also include 17,000 square feet of retail space and 175 parking spaces.
There will also be a 5,000-square-foot day-care center for 100 children. And local and county social service groups will provide, among other things, job training and after-school programs for children.
"The project will have an impact on an underserved neighborhood," said Edward Martoglio, a partner at RPM, adding that "the shops will bring in jobs."
Mr. Martoglio said the tax credits had been sold, raising $10 million and representing 70 percent of the financing for the more than $14 million project. Combining the credits with the state fund "makes sizable projects feasible," he said.
THE one- to three-bedroom apartments, with 550 to 1,200 square feet, will rent for $475 to $575 a month. Construction will start in September and take 15 months to complete.
In North Wildwood, $1.4 million in tax credits and a $1.47 million state grant will be used to build a 142-unit rental for the elderly, which will rise on a 1.8-acre site on New York Avenue next to a marina and overlooking Grassy Sound.
Called St. Anne's Marina Bay Tower, it will also include "senior service suites" where social-service providers will offer, among other programs, nutritional counseling and exercise classes, said Paul Cocoziello, vice president of Consult Realty Corporation of West Orange, which is developing the $14 million project.
He said he expected to raise $11 million from the sale of the credits, "without which the project would absolutely not have been possible."
It is also part of a larger project, which Consult is also developing, that "will give an economic boost" to a section of the city's waterfront, he said. That project will comprise 7,000 square feet of new and renovated retail space. All the apartments will have one bedroom and 750 square feet of space. They will be rented for $375 a month.
The building will be owned and operated by St. Anne Urban Renewal Limited Partnership, whose general partner is an affiliate of the Archdiocese of Camden. The partnership is leasing the site from the marina owner, said Mr Cocoziello. Construction on the rental building and retail space will start this fall and be completed by the end of 1998.
In Union City, $1 million in tax credits was awarded to a developer to transform the burnt-out St. Michael's monastery into 70 rentals. In 1994, the monastery was ravaged by a fire, which destroyed its roof and much of its interior. In some places only foundations remain, in others just the walls.
The Roman Catholic Monastery and Church of St. Michael the Archangel -- a site bounded by 18th, 21st and West Streets and Summit Avenue and equal to six city blocks -- was purchased by developers in the mid-80's, except for the house of worship, now the North Hudson Korean Presbyterian Congregation. The entire site is on the National Register of Historic Places.
At the time of the sale by the Passionist Community, members of the order in the monastery had dwindled from a peak of 102 to 21. After the sale most were sent to duties elsewhere; five remain in a residence across from the former monastery complex.
Over the years several plans were proposed for converting the monastery to housing, but none had the necessary financing. But elsewhere on the grounds there is a 41-unit, market-rate town-house community called St. Michael's Walk.
The current developer, Monastery Urban Renewal Associates of Oakland, plans to build anew on the devastated areas and restore the salvageable ones -- all the while preserving as much of the original building as possible, said Gregory J. Allen, vice president at the development firm..
The sale of the tax credits will raise $7 million of the $9.2 million cost of the project. "The credits are the reason this project is possible," said Stuart Portney, a principal of the Metro Company, a Jersey City-based planning and financial consultant working with the developer.
The project also secured $1.7 million in loans and grants from Hudson County, he said, noting that county groups would also conduct educational and other programs at meeting rooms that will be included at the building.
The one- to three-bedroom apartments, with 520 to 930 square feet of space, will rent for $435 to $605 a month. Construction is to start in October and finish by early 1999.
Asked why he did not just clear the site and build anew, Mr. Allen said that "it would be a significant loss to the community."
Moreover, said Mr. Allen, who grew up across the street from the church complex, "I wanted to give something back to the city, and maybe make a little profit."

HEADLINE: Commercial Property;
In the Suburbs, Steel Rises Again

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA

 BODY:
AFTER being on the endangered-species list in recent years, construction cranes are being spotted on suburban horizons again. Office buildings custom built for corporate customers are rising in Westchester and Fairfield Counties, and in New Jersey speculative development is under way for the first time in a decade.
"The oversupply of office space lasted from 1989 to 1995, but now it is time to build again," said Steven J. Pozycki, whose SJP Properties is completing an eight-story, 240,000-square-foot office building in Bridgewater, N.J., and preparing to start another in a planned six-building office park at the Somerset County location. The development, across Route 202-206 from the 1.1 million-square-foot Bridgewater Commons shopping mall, is 3.5 miles south of the intersection of Interstates 78 and 287. 
 "When you see rents at $30 a foot and break-even is $24 a foot, you have to be crazy not to build," said Cary Heller, who is planning to break ground in September for a 110,000-square-foot office building in East Hanover, N.J., in a joint venture with his uncle, Gene Heller.
The building, called Eagle Rock III after a nearby road, is another example of the way New Jersey is defined by the interchange. A big selling point for the location is that nearby Edwards Road, which has limited access to Interstate 280, has been approved by highway authorities for a full four-way interchange with the highway.
"New Jersey is the most dynamic market in the region because its communities are less restrictive than places like Long Island," said Donald Eisen, a senior managing director with Cushman & Wakefield. "We are seeing buildings coming out of the ground and markets that were left for dead that couldn't be hotter."
Not all the building is in New Jersey. In Stamford, Conn., where there are still vacant lots downtown from the end of the last wave of building, a trading pavilion and office tower that are the major parts of what is eventually to be a 1.2 million square-foot complex are being completed for Swiss Bank Corporation. The bank is preparing to leave its current location at 222 Broadway in lower Manhattan early next year.
In Westchester County, I.B.M. is finishing a new headquarters building on its existing property in Armonk. The three-story, 280,000-square-foot building, near the current headquarters, is designed to house about 600 people compared to the 900 that could be accommodated by the existing 400,000-square-foot structure. An I.B.M. spokesman said it had not yet been decided what will be done with the older building.
Across Route 120 from I.B.M., land is being cleared for a 313,000-square-foot headquarters building for Swiss Re America, a leading reinsurance company. Real estate executives said this was the first new corporate headquarters building to go up in Westchester County since Texaco moved there over 20 years ago.
Other projects in Westchester have been approved, even though the developers are not ready to put a spade in the ground. Louis Dreyfus Property Group, a subsidiary of a French commodities trading company, has approval for a 313,980-square-foot office complex near Interstate 684 in Goldens Bridge.
But brokers say corporate relocations and skittish lenders are holding back development in the suburbs to the north and northeast of New York. "There's lots of talk, but not a whole lot of action," said Gerard Hallock, a broker with ESG/Rostenberg-Doern, who specializes in Fairfield County. "To get financing, you have to have a building at least 50 percent preleased."
He said the office market in the area was not helped by the decision of a major employer, the GTE Corporation, to transfer its headquarters to Dallas. Others noted that Pepsico's decision to sell its 500,000-square-foot building in Somers to consolidate at its headquarters in Purchase added further uncertainly to the market.
A survey by ESG/Rostenberg-Doern found that because of corporate transfers and downsizings, the vacancy rate in Westchester actually rose during the year, from 16.5 percent at the end of the first quarter to 17 percent at the end of the second.
On Long Island, rents have not risen to a level that would justify new construction, said Scott Rechler, chief operating officer of Reckson Associates Realty Group, a real estate investment trust based in Melville. "We have been busy doing redevelopment while we wait for rents to make new development possible," he said.
Most developers on Long Island have been through several up and down cycles and are wary of plunging in too soon with new construction, said Theodore P. Sasso, a senior managing director with Insignia/ ESG. "There is a unique situation on Long Island compared to the rest of the state," he said. "All the building here is done by local developers, rather than regional or national companies, and local developers tend to be conservative."
HE said the fundamentals of the office market, shrinking concessions packages and rising effective rents, were moving in the right direction and "there has been a fair amount of activity in land sales, so there is a good base of approved sites."
"All we are waiting for is for someone to pull the trigger," Mr. Sasso said.
William E. Greiner, president of Greiner-Maltz Company, a brokerage concern that specializes in Long Island, noted that development of office buildings on the island had been inhibited by the need to absorb 1 million square feet of office space abandoned by Grumman as the company was reduced in size. He said activity on the industrial side of the business has been picking up as companies expanded their warehouse-distribution facilities or built new ones.
"I can think of half a dozen new projects off the top of my head and I'm sure I could find more if I went through files," he said. "The point is that for the first time since 1985-1986, we have seen the return of an industrial construction market."
If Reckson has been reticent in its home market, it has been active in New Jersey, where the REIT purchased a trophy property, the undeveloped portion of Giralda Farms, 188 acres of land in Madison Borough and Chatham Township near I-287. The site is currently zoned to permit the building of 1.1 million square feet of office space. Sections of the site that were developed previously are the home of headquarters for the American Home Products, Schering-Plough and Atlantic Mutual companies.
Mark Schaevitz, the managing director of Reckson's operations in New Jersey, said the company would take its time deciding how to develop the site, which he described as "the prettiest piece of ground I've ever seen." He said the company was not prepared to build on the site on a purely speculative basis.
"We are beginning the process of design and securing an anchor tenant, before we start to build," he said. Other real estate executives said that getting permission to build may be a difficult one in affluent Chatham Township, where many residents value the meadows and trees on the site more than any tax revenues new building might bring.
About 10 miles north of Madison, Reckson is doing a completely speculative redevelopment with an existing building once occupied by BASF Corporation at the intersection of Route 3 and the Garden State Parkway. "We are taking that 180,000-square-foot building in Clifton and stripping it down to the structural steel," Mr. Schaevitz said. "We are going to convert it from a commercial use to Class A office and it has not been preleased."
He said he expected that the improvements to the building and its location near important highways would make it attractive to office customers.
The fundamentals of the New Jersey office market appear to support new building ventures. According to a survey by Julien J. Studley Inc., vacancy rates in the northern and central parts of the state have dropped sharply in the last year, from 15.1 percent in the second quarter of 1996 to 9.6 percent in the same period this year.
Because of the sharp drop in real estate values in the early 1990's, when developers lost control of projects and banks lost large parts of their loans, lenders have been reluctant to finance new construction, leading to increased bidding for existing space. The Studley survey found that "free rent is virtually nonexistent" and that allowances for building interiors for tenants are half or less of what was offered two years ago.
Mr. Pozycki said the building SJP is completing in Bridgewater is 98 percent leased, and the company is prepared to start on another 240,000-square-foot structure in October. In all, he said, he has approvals to build 1.5 million square feet of space at the site, where the buildings will be set in an array around a five-acre park complete with a pond and fountain. He said his Somerset Corporate Center and other office projects that are under way represent relatively modest additions to the state's large base of office space. "New Jersey is the fourth largest commercial office building market in the nation when you are looking at properties of 75,000 square feet or more," he said. "It's an enormous market with over 190 million square feet of space."
He said one reason the state was proving more attractive to corporations than Westchester or Fairfield was that it has more diversified housing, which means workers at all income levels are available. "In Westchester and Fairfield, low- and middle-income housing does not exist," he said.
Another important reason is that job growth in New Jersey has outpaced that of New York and Connecticut, said James W. Hughes, dean of the Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University. "The economy in New Jersey has revived faster than the rest of the region," he said. "New Jersey has recovered just about all the jobs lost during the recession, while New York and Connecticut recovered about 50 percent."
The privately held SJP kept its head down during the long recession, doing custom buildings for companies like Englehard Corporation in Iselin and holding on to the land it had acquired in more optimistic times. "We have land to develop 10 million square feet of space," Mr. Pozycki said. "It took some heavy lifting to hold on to it during the depression."
Keeping the land and going through the lengthy approval process when it was clear that nothing was going to be built anytime soon was important, Mr. Pozycki said, because it allowed him to react quickly as the market improved.
Indeed, most of the projects now getting under way are completions of undertakings that stopped when corporations downsized in the late 1980's, knocking out the underpinnings of the office market, Mr. Heller observed. His project, which he said was purely speculative, is the unbuilt fourth building of a planned four-building office park whose developer was unable to complete it in the late 1980's.
ONE permanent effect of the recession, he said, is that companies are packing people in more tightly than ever, which is altering the design of buildings and nearby areas. More people means more need for parking spaces in an area where the only commuting option is a motor vehicle.
Mr. Heller said he shrunk the size of the planned building from 120,000 to 110,000 square feet so he could fit in 4.8 parking spaces per 1,000 square feet, up from the planned 4.5. Groundbreaking is now set for Sept. 24. "It's going to be more than ceremonial," he said. "We are going to really move some dirt."
He said the project was being developed as a joint venture between his company, Sym Heller Associates, and G. Heller Enterprises. The senior Mr. Heller was associated for many years with Hartz Mountain development and more recently has been an independent developer.
Speculation in the late 1990's is not quite what it was a decade ago. Cary Heller said the venture was committed only to building the shell of the building. The interiors, he said, will not be constructed until at least one-third of the space has been leased.
Cary Heller said he and other developers were helped by the state's passage of a permit-extension act, which allowed developers to keep their building permits valid without going back to municipalities for extensions. "When you get an approval it is usually good for two years," he said. "When it expires you can go back for a one-year extension and you can only get one of those."
Having land with permits in place helps a developer by letting him bring new product to market before competitors can get under way. "Timing is key," he said. "You have to get into the ground as quickly as possible before contractors start to be less available." He said the building would be ready for interior finishing by June and ready for occupancy in early September 1998.
"Developers are looking for sites that have approvals because you can provide space in nine months to a year compared to as much as three years starting from scratch," said Joseph Romano, a broker with Grubb & Ellis in New Jersey. "We seem to have finally caught up with the glut left over from the 1980's."
Gale & Wentworth is another builder betting on the recovery of the New Jersey office market. It is constructing a four-building office park in Florham Park, near Morristown, and recently acquired 90 acres of land near the intersection of Interstates 80 and 287 in Parsippany to do a six-building, 1.1 million-square-foot development.
Stanley C. Gale, a principal of the firm, said the Florham Park project, scheduled to have 1,148,000 square feet of office space on 138 acres, was only semi-speculative. "We have anchor tenants for three of the four buildings and are negotiating with a potential tenant to lease the entire fourth building," he said. But he said there was space available in the first three buildings.
Mr. Gale said work would start early next year at the site along I-80 in Parsippany and that the company was expecting to put up a 260,000-square-foot office structure in Bedminster, N.J., starting later this year.
Like Mr. Pozycki, Mr. Gale stressed the extent of the office market in New Jersey. In the northern part of the state alone, he said, there is 160 million square feet of occupied space. "All it takes is a 10 percent demand growth, and you are talking about 16 million square feet," he said. He said telecommunications companies like Lucent, AT&T and MCI and pharmaceutical companies like Merck, Johnson & Johnson and American Home Products have been attracted to the state because of its highway and communication networks. The state's highway system is better developed than in the northern suburbs of the city and there is more land available for building, he said.
It is not surprising, therefore, to find that Mr. Gale's projects have strong highway connections. The northern Morris County site in Parsippany has a half mile of frontage on Interstate 80, while the Florham Park tract is flanked by the new, multilane Route 24. The Bedminster building will be near the intersection of Route 206 and I-287.
Industrial markets in the state are stirring as well. Matrix Development Group has acquired an old Phelps Dodge plant next to the New Jersey Turnpike near exit 8A and will enlarge the existing 637,000-square-foot building to a 1.2 million-square-foot warehouse-distribution center, one of the largest in the state, on a speculative basis.
"Industrial markets in New Jersey are among the strongest in the country," said Paul R, Rubincam 3d, a vice president of Matrix. He said vacancy rates for warehouse properties in the central part of the state are less than 8 percent, "and much of the product is functionally obsolete" because of low ceiling heights.
He said that new product-handling equipment allowed warehouse operators to use taller storage racks. "The owners are finding that the cheapest space is cube space," he said. By building taller structures, warehouse owners can handle more product without having to develop more land.
BUT taller warehouses bring stricter technical requirements. "Floors have to be flat to super-flat and capable of bearing heavier loads," he said. When a storage rack is 30 to 35 feet high, he noted, a one-eighth-inch deviation from level at the floor means a major distortion at the top.
Industrial property developers, he said, are starting projects with an eye to the real estate investment trusts that are becoming such important players in the industry. "We are taking the risk of building for markets that may be 18 months to two years out," he said. REITs and other investors prefer to buy existing properties, rather then become developers themselves, he said.
There are other projects in the planning stage that will evidently have to wait for further evidence of the market's strength. Mr. Pozycki speaks enthusiastically about a waterfront office/retail/hotel/residential development in Hoboken, which he calls the "sixth borough" of New York because of its extensive transportation links to the city.
There are other waterfront projects pending as well, including a 12-story, 435,000-square-foot office tower at 90 Hudson Street in Jersey City's Colgate Center and a 758,525-square-foot building by the Lefrak Organization in the city's Newport development. Farther inland, the Rockefeller Group is in discussions to put up a building for Bell Labs in Florham Park.
Mr. Pozycki said the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey has spent $80 million to renovate two piers that are part of the Hoboken site, including one that was the site of the film "On the Waterfront." The site, which is just north of the city's railroad terminal, would include 1.1 million square feet of office space, 50,000 square feet of ground floor retail space, a 300-room hotel and 350 to 400 units of luxury apartments.
Mr. Pozycki said he was eager to get started on the development, but his enthusiasm is tempered by reality. "We won't start on a 100 percent speculative basis," he said. "We need to have the office space 30 to 40 percent leased before we go forward."
