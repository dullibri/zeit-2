HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Getting Prepared For One Germany

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
MANY people's anxieties these days focus on the political and military dangers of German unification. Memories of the Third Reich do not fade.
But in a world in which economics is a crucial element in national and international power, attention must be paid to the economic consequences of the unified Germany that appears to be emerging, before the rest of the world is ready for it.
West Germany is already the strongest economy in Europe. The prospect of an even greater Germany, with the biggest population, the largest gross national product, the strongest balance of payments and the strongest currency in Europe, strikes other governments, West and East, as too big to swallow. 
Yet, after the pressures unleashed by the economic slide of the Communist bloc and the nationalistic forces released by the peaceful revolution in East Germany, unification looks unstoppable, whether sooner or a bit later. It therefore has become more important than ever for Germany to be closely linked to the European Community and to remain within the only European body in which the United States still plays the leading role, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany, caught up this week in the enthusiasm of the crowds in East Germany who chanted ''Deutschland, Deutschland!'' declared, ''My goal, if the hour of history allows it, is the unity of the nation.'' Yet while proclaiming that the two Germanys are on the difficult path to forging a single state, he urged East Germans to take account of the views and interests of their neighbors.
The strongest resistance to a united Germany is likely to come not from President Francois Mitterrand of France or Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain or President Bush but from the Soviet President, Mikhail S. Gorbachev. He has been declaring that the Soviet Union paid 20 million lives for the current stability of the West.
But must German unification necessarily disrupt stability? ''Much depends on the process of change,'' a leading European specialist, Ivo Lederer of the Stanford Research Institute, said in an interview. ''If other countries criticize or try to impede the process, the Germans are likely to dig in their heels, and nationalism will gain support.'' If the process can be conducted intelligently and slowly, and if the Germans make clear that they intend to remain members of the Western team, he contended, a united Germany could lend economic and political strength to the West.
The main hope for preventing unification pressures from wrecking the European Community and the Atlantic alliance, or from reviving antagonisms between the West and the Soviet Union, would be for West Germany, backed by its allies, to provide economic help to East Germany and other Eastern European states.
Apart from government aid, what is needed is the creation of an environment that will encourage private businesses to invest in the East and ease technology transfer and economic development of those Communist, or formerly Communist, countries willing to cooperate in a new version of the Marshall Plan. That could include the Soviet Union itself. Probably the most important aspect of the Marshall Plan was the thrust it gave to national improvements in organization and productivity, and the revival of business investment and trade.
The forces of a perfervid nationalism of the right were growing again in West Germany even before the revolution in East Germany erupted. Now, with the prospect of reunification nearer, German nationalism has inevitably been given new impetus.
If the East Germans, having lived so long under the yoke of their Communist masters, should freely choose to change their economic and political system, the problem of German unification will in time solve itself. Immediately, however, the issue of national sovereignty could be too menacing for the European Community and other countries to handle. Chancellor Kohl appeared to get it right when he said in Dresden this week, ''With common sense and moderation and a sense for realities, we can reach our goal.''
A critical test will come on May 7, when parliamentary elections will be held in East Germany. If the result should be a mandate for immediate unification, the Western alliance and the detente with the Soviet Union could suffer a serious blow. The United States, now preoccupied with Panama, might not be paying sufficient attention to the heightened German problem.
A healthy economic and political outcome in Europe will primarily be up to the Europeans, and especially to rational and cautious leadership in both East and West Germany. The United States can best back that play by holding to an open trade policy and by working within NATO for a reassessment of the threat from the East and a consequent reduction in military expenditures that would aid economic stability and growth. That would help provide the resources, and the will, for a new Marshall Plan.

HEADLINE: Spending Rises 0.7%; Income Up

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 21

 BODY:
Consumer spending rebounded in November from a sharp fall in the previous month, while personal incomes increased eight-tenths of 1 percent.
The Commerce Department said today that consumer spending rose at a seasonally adjusted annual rate to $3.54 trillion, a seven-tenths of 1 percent increase that was the steepest gain since a 1 percent jump last March. In October, consumer spending had fallen two-tenths of 1 percent, the first decrease since a one-tenth of 1 percent dip in September 1988 and the largest drop since a 1.4 percent fall in January 1987. 
Analysts said consumer spending continues to be one of the bright spots in a slowing economy.
 
'Consumer Has Not Turned Off'
''It suggests that while we have some weak areas in the economy, particularly in the manufacturing sector, that the consumer has not turned off completely,'' said David Jones, an economist with Aubrey G. Lanston & Company in New York.
But some analysts questioned whether income growth will soon begin to weaken and thus cause a decline in spending.
Consumer spending, which has been a major factor for the economic growth during the first nine months of the year, is watched closely as a barometer of economic health because it accounts for about two-thirds of the nation's economic activity.
The Commerce Department reported last week that retail sales rose eight-tenths of 1 percent in November, a rebound from a 1.3 percent decrease in October. Analysts said it reflected the start of the Christmas buying season the weekend after Thanksgiving.
As measured by the gross national product, the economy grew at a 3 percent rate in the third quarter after gains of 3.7 percent in the first and 2.5 percent in the second, but analysts expect a sharp decline in the three-month period ending Dec. 31.
Mr. Jones said prospects are good for continued consumer spending, ''particularly in nondurables such as apparel, and in the services area because consumers are still basically optimistic and have income growth to support that optimism.''
Personal incomes in November totaled $4.54 trillion at a seasonally adjusted annual rate, following a similar eight-tenths of 1 percent gain, to $4.50 trillion, in October. It was the largest increase since a 1 percent gain last March.
The $26.2 billion increase in personal consumption, which includes everything except interest payments on debt, contrasted to a $6.3 billion decrease in October.
 
Nondurable Purchases Up
Purchases of durable goods - big-ticket items expected to last more than three years - rose $1.9 billion, while purchases of nondurable goods jumped $12.4 billion. Spending on services increased $11.9 billion.
The November report showed that Americans' incomes after taxes rose nine-tenths of 1 percent, up from October's eight-tenths of 1 percent gain.
Americans' savings rate - savings as a percent of disposable income -rose to 6.1 percent, up from October's 5.7 percent rate.
The key component of the income category, wages and salaries, edged up $1.7 billion in November after a $29.4 billion gain in October.
Payrolls at manufacturing companies, hit hardest by the Federal Reserve's high-interest polices, fell $4.9 billion, after an October advance of $6.3 billion.

HEADLINE: Slower Growth Seen In Industrialized World

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Dec. 21

 BODY:
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development today projected that growth in the industrial world would slow next year while inflation would inch up slightly.
In its semiannual forecast, the Paris-based group noted that the industrial world had grown at a strong 4 percent pace for more than two years. But it said that growth had started to slow, and would continue slowing next year, because of restrictive economic policies, weakening trade with the third world and a slowdown in investment. 
The O.E.C.D. projected that the United States economy would grow by a modest 2.3 percent next year, compared with the 3 percent rate it expects this year. Last year, the American economy grew by 4.4 percent.
The group said unemployment could stop falling as a result of the slowdown in growth. It prediced that the American jobless rate would rise to 5.4 percent next year from 5.2 percent this year.
The group said inflation in the United States would inch up to 4.4 percent next year, compared with 4.3 percent this year. Although it praised many governments for tightening monetary policies to battle inflation, it predicted that prices would rise by 5 percent or more next year in Canada, Britain and Italy.
 
Price 'Drift' Feared
''Even if inflation has stabilized, and at a lower rate than some observers had feared, it is high enough to be of concern,'' the O.E.C.D. said. Its economists expressed fear that acceptance of a high inflation rate would lead to a ''cumulative upward drift'' in prices.
The O.E.C.D. group projected a worsening, rather than improvement, in trade imbalances among the leading industrial nations. While it saw a slight narrowing of the American trade defcit next year, to $118.1 billion, from $121.5 billion this year, it saw the Japanese and German surpluses widening. It said Japan's trade surplus would rise from $60.8 billion this year to $61.1 billion next year and $68.6 billion in 1991.
As for West Germany, that nation's trade surplus is expected to jump from $60.9 billion this year to $70.8 billion next year and $75.7 billion in 1991.
The organization questioned whether these imbalances were sustainable. Regarding nations with chronic trade deficits, which include the United States, Britain and Spain, it said what was needed was a set of policies that addressed the underlying problems of national savings and competitivess.
Founded in 1960, the O.E.C.D. is an organization of 24 industrial nations that seeks to promote economic growth and cooperation.

Caterpillar's Stock Declines

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: PEORIA, Ill., Dec. 21

 BODY:
Caterpillar Inc.'s stock fell sharply today after the heavy-equipment maker lowered its outlook for the fourth quarter, blaming sluggish economic growth for depressing its sales, especially in the construction industry. 
Caterpillar's stock fell $1.75, to $57.75, in active New York Stock Exchange trading.
The Peoria, Ill., company said its fourth-quarter profit would likely be less than the $1.07 a share reported in the third quarter. In the 1988 fourth quarter, Caterpillar posted earnings of $1.61 a share. Analysts lowered their estimates for this year's final quarter to between 75 and 90 cents a share.
They said the weak sales follow sluggish demand for commercial, industrial and construction equipment, which last year accounted for 29 percent of Caterpillar's sales.

HEADLINE: Stocks Gain; Dow Rises 3.20 Points

BYLINE: By RICHARD D. HYLTON

 BODY:
Stock prices were slightly higher yesterday, as advances of blue chips helped to pull up smaller stocks.
The Dow Jones industrial average edged up 3.20 points, to 2,691.13, as advancing issues on the New York Stock Exchange outstripped declining ones by 932 to 627. Volume was a low 175 million.
''We're really talking about a market that's struggling,'' said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer of the First Albany Corporation. ''What's happening is there is legitimate concern about the state of the economy.'' 
Mr. Johnson added that the market responded soberly to a move toward lower rates by the Federal Reserve on Wednesday because investors and traders were looking for a stronger action by the central bank.
''We did get a response from the Fed,'' Mr. Johnson said. ''They gave us a modest response to the slowing economic numbers, and I think there is some nervousness that we might not see any more. The consensus on Wall Street is that the Fed has gone as far as it's going for now.''
Among advancing blue chips, I.B.M. was up 1/2, to 95 1/8; American Express 3/8, to 31 5/8; General Electric 1/2, to 62 7/8, and General Motors 7/8, 42 3/8.
 
Disney Regains Ground
The Walt Disney Company, reversing some of the Wednesday's losses, climbed 2 1/4, to 114 1/4. Some analysts called Wednesday's decline, which was attributed to profit taking, excessive.
Technology issues made up some more of the ground they have been losing in recent weeks. Apple Computer was up 1/2, to 36 1/4; Digital Equipment Corp. gained 1/2 to end at 84; Compaq Computer gained 2 to end at 81 7/8, and Intel Corporation moved up 1 7/8, to 33 3/8.
Shares of the Campbell Soup Company rose 2 7/8, to 56 3/4, on more rumors of that the company would be the subject of a buyout because of the liquidation of a Dorrance family trust. Members of the Dorrance family, which founded the company, have maintained, however, that they want the company to remain independent.
Bank of New England slipped 1/4, to 7 1/2, after Duff & Phelps Inc. said it had lowered its ratings of the bank's securities.
Federal National Mortgage Association, known as Fannie Mae, continuing its recent rebound, moved up 1/8, to 34 1/2.
Caterpillar fell 1 7/8, to 57 5/8, after James McGann, an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert, lowered his 1989 earnings estimates for the company. Caterpillar announced that fourth-quarter earnings would be below third-quarter levels.
 
Some Utilities Off
The Boston Edison Company lost 1 1/2, to 20 1/8, after announcing write-offs of about $170 million and a dividend cut.
Commonwealth Edison fell 2 5/8, to 36 7/8, after a consumer group asked the Illinois utility regulators to cut the company's rates and refund $270 million plus interest to customers.
Stride-Rite Corporation, which moved up 3 3/8, to 26 7/8, made up some of the ground it lost on Wednesday after it announced estimates of flat fourth-quarter earnings.
The Dow transportation average also moved up, with a strong gain of 6.93 points to end at 1143.67. UAL Corporation, the parent company of United Airlines, gained 1 to end at 158, on continued buyout speculation. Delta Air Lines advanced 1 3/4, to 67 1/4, after announcing that the airline would match the fare cuts by Southwest Airlines earlier this week.
Broader market indexes also made small gains. The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks moved up 1.94, to 344.78, while the New York Stock Exchange composite index advanced 0.96, to 190.50.
On the American Stock Exchange the market value index registered a gain of 1.37 to bring it to 369.55.
The Nasdaq composite index gained 4.15 points, to 441.09, with technology issues again leading the list of most actively traded over-the-counter stocks.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Moderate Drop for Dollar On Sign of Action By Fed

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar declined modestly against most major currencies in quiet trading yesterday, tipped lower by renewed anticipation of lower interest rates.
Gold prices also slipped. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery closed at $411.90 an ounce, down from $413.60 late Wednesday.
Dealers said currency traders shrugged off the United States military action in Panama.
''The market viewed it as a very short-lived situation,'' said Stephen Flanagan, a vice president of foreign exchange at the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company. ''Interest rates seem to be dominating the market right now.''
On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve appeared to signal an easing of its monetary policy when it added reserves to the banking system. The action helped push down the Federal funds rate, a important barometer of interest rates.
Economists have expected the central bank to ease monetary policy to stimulate the sagging economy. At the same time, a drop in interest rates cuts yields on dollar-denominated investments.
By the end of trading in New York, the dollar had slipped to 143.65 yen, down from 143.93 yen late Wednesday. And a pound cost $1.6145, more expensive than $1.6060 late Wednesday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Wednesday's rates, included: 1.7260 West German marks, down from 1.7320; 5.8900 French francs, down from 5.9125; 1.5580 Swiss francs, up from 1.5555; 1,285.50 Italian lire, down from 1,288.50, and 1.1597 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1609.
On the Commodity Exchange, silver for current delivery closed at $5.543 an ounce, down from $5.548 late Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Neighborhoods Santa Has No Trouble Finding

BYLINE: By ANDREW L. YARROW

 BODY:
UNADORNED homes are rare commodities around Christmastime in Bay Ridge, Bensonhurst and Canarsie. With thousands of plastic Santas and snowmen, armies of toy soldiers and multicolored megawatts of lights decorating block upon block of houses and apartment buildings, no one could accuse these Brooklyn neighborhoods of a lack of holiday cheer.
Indeed, no other areas of New York City have such an abundance of private outdoor Christmas lights and decorations as these heavily Italian-American communities. These seasonal displays - which tread a fine line between folk art and festivity -range from simple garlands of lights on a front porch or miniature Nativity scenes to expensive, Disneyesque yards full of animated Santas, elves and reindeer. 
''There's a very innocent, the-more-the-merrier attitude about the lights and plastic decor,'' said Lou Singer, an independent tour guide who is conducting a Christmas Lights bus tour every night through Jan. 4. ''As you go from Canarsie to the Dyker Heights section of Bay Ridge, the economic levels change, as do ideas of what constitutes beauty. Canarsie, which is a working-class area, is heavily plastic and very kitschy. In Bensonhurst, which has a lot of blue-collar and civil-service people, the displays are moderately kitschy, with some clever items. And in Dyker Heights, which is well to do, you really have designer lighting.''
The six-hour tour - which Mr. Singer added five years ago to his already offbeat repertory of guided excursions - seems ideally suited to this 64-year-old raconteur about all things relating to Brooklyn. It begins at 5:30 P.M. at 325 East 41st Street in Manhattan, and proceeds first to Brighton Beach for a pre-lights Russian dinner at Primorski's restaurant. Then, after a quick foray into M & I International Food - a two-story market catering to the area's large Russian emigre population -Mr. Singer guides his mini-bus toward Canarsie.
Just off Rockaway Parkway near Flatlands Avenue, the show begins. Normally nondescript bungalows near Avenues J, K, L and M shimmer with red and white lights, as a melange of religious and secular symbols dot the small front yards. Driving past a house at Flatlands and 93d Street, with an animated Santa and what he called a ''rather big outburst'' of lights, Mr. Singer suggested that ''Con Edison probably gives them a medal.''
The most elaborate display, however, appears as Mr. Singer navigates through blocks of brick row houses and two-family homes in Bensonhurst. Just when it seems as though one had seen every imaginable variation on the Christmas-lights theme, the bus pulls up to the house of the Bruncati and di Martino families on 28th Avenue between Cropsey and Harway Avenues. A series of animated, glass-enclosed dioramas in the yard includes a herd of eight nodding reindeer, a quartet of plastic carolers, a brigade of busy elves, and an upside-down Santa haplessly attempting to descend a too-snug chimney.
''My uncle started it 31 years ago, and it's been getting bigger each year,'' said Joseph di Martino, who spends three months preparing the display each year. ''I've got about $42,000 sitting in the yard. There are 61 figures and 12,000 lightbulbs, and the electric bill for December is about $370. My father says it's gotten out of control, but it's my gift to the neighborhood.''
 
It Seemes to Start With One
Surveying Brooklyn's sparkling displays, Mr. Singer said, ''My guess is that, on a block, one person starts it and the others try to outdo him.''
That certainly seems to be the case in the vicinity of 11th and 12th Avenues, between 79th and 86th Streets, in Dyker Heights. Here, the big brick homes look like over-sized gingerbread houses dripping with lights.
The rather free-form tour concludes with a visit to an Italian pastry shop in Bensonhurst and a late-night stop at the Brooklyn Heights promenade for a view of another forest of lights - the skyline of lower Manhattan.
The tour costs $25, plus $16 for the dinner, which is optional. Up to 29 people can be accommodated. Reservations: (718) 875-9084.

Could It Be the 70's Again? An Artist Looks Back.

BYLINE: By ROBERTA SMITH

 BODY:
Betty Collings's new work is a kind of contradiction. Her colorful vinyl sculptures may convey a sense of deja vu - they hark back to Process Art of the early 1970's - and yet many of them hold their own in the present, as a further development of early 70's concerns and ideals.
This quality gives Ms. Collings's show at the Bertha Urdang Gallery, which is her fourth since she started exhibiting here in 1979, a sense of edgy double time. You might want to dismiss it, especially with more than 20 pieces crowded into a gallery that has seen better days as an apartment. But it's not so easy.
Even though the viewer must make a special effort to isolate good work from mediocre, some of these pieces are terrific. The best of them exude a playful devil-may-care spirit - the feeling of abstract toys - that has something in common with the art of Alexander Calder. But they also represent a serious effort to fuse painting with sculpture and to liberate color and form, setting them loose in a world that is at once purely visual and full of suggestions and associations. 
The works on view speak clearly of the early 70's esthetic milieu, and will evoke memories of the efforts from that period of Lynda Benglis, Richard Van Buren and Keith Sonnier, all emerging as artists when Ms. Collings was in graduate school at Ohio State University. It was a moment when many younger artists strove to escape the contraints of traditional painting and sculpture.
New materials and their processes - plastics, resins and vinyls, for example - were frequently called into play. Art objects might be hung on the wall (or from the ceiling, for that matter), but they tended to avoid the flat or rectangular; they might sit on the ground, but they usually did so directly, without benefit of pedestal.
Ascribing to all these principles, Ms. Collings's new work is made of vinyl shaped into big inflatable forms that sit lightly on the floor, hang from the ceiling or, in their most elongated and columnar states, do a bit of both. In fact, all the shapes are distorted columns, mathematically based and related to the helix. Some twist at either end like rams' horns, others bulge unpredictably like eccentric perfume bottles, unfamiliar sea forms or creatures out of Dr. Seuss. Their mathematical aspect has affinities with the art of Ruth Vollmer, whose seemingly organic yet mathematically based sculptures, made mostly in the 1960's, influenced the development of Sol LeWitt, Eva Hesse and Robert Smithson.
In the best pieces, the vinyl is a pale translucent green or pink that has random scars and bubbles like those found in Roman glass. (When Ms. Collings ventures into clear plastic, things get garish.) Their surfaces are gaily - yet, one suspects, systematically - dotted, dashed or daubed with bright acrylic paint. The seams of the vinyl sometimes curl around the form like a spiral, both enhancing the sense of mathematical impetus and creating paths that seem to determine the paint patterns.
Ms. Collings might be described as a second-generation Process Artist who has persisted with ideas brought to prominence, but also largely abandoned, by those more famous than herself. Her art has a deliberateness and a variety that frequently escaped her mentors. In particular, it has a faith in painting and in what the well-laced brush stroke can express that seems more of the 1980's than the 70's.
Whatever seems strange or incomplete about her pieces might be laid, in part, to their being out of fashion; it may be hard for eyes sated on the constant quotations and commentaries of 80's art to even see this work. But as a result, this show provides a valuable articulation of the very things that mitigate against it: the passage of time, the changing of styles and the fading of knowledge concerning work that does not enter the pantheon of recent art. Among many other things, it reminds how quickly one forgets.
Betty Collings's vinyl sculptures remain at the Bertha Urdang Gallery, 23 East 74th Street, through Jan. 6.
 
'Dennis Oppenheim:
The Early Years, 1967-72'
Gordon Matta-Clark: Drawings
 
Holly Solomon Gallery
724 Fifth Avenue (near 57th Street)
Through Dec. 30
This pair of exhibitions provides a true return to the late 1960's and early 70's. The front galleries at Holly Solomon are packed cheek to jowl with Dennis Oppenheim's early pieces, and show an artist equally at ease using his own body to make art or employing a harvesting machine to draw lines in a field of grain.
The best works on view combine texts, photographs and sometimes maps to document Mr. Oppenheim's performance pieces and, in particular, his many ephemeral earth works. In one, the 1968 ''Time Line,'' he traces the boundary line between the United States and Canada on top of the frozen St. John River, which runs between Maine and New Brunswick, making real a line usually most tangible on a map.
In another, he spells the word ''radicality'' in flaming torches placed in the side of a hill. But there are also many drawings for installation pieces and more earth works, two sculptures and two video works. At every turn, the show evokes a period of almost frantic experimentation, when many artists were driven by a strong desire to try almost anything and call it art.
In the back galleries, also hung cheek to jowl, are more than 30 drawings made from 1972 to 1974 by Gordon Matta-Clark, an artist who died of cancer in 1978 at the age of 35. Matta-Clark is best known for turning abandoned houses and buildings into sculpture by cutting out huge portions of their walls and floors.
These drawings - on paper, in frames - are considerably more traditional, but they chart the same energetic imagination. This imagination is expressed in ink, pencil and colored marker, and in motifs that sometimes suggest outlandish flora (and maybe fauna), or that sometimes simply consist of cavorting dotted lines and speeding arrows. The antic, cartoonish flair of the work may in part reflect the influence of the artist's father, the Chilean Surrealist painter Roberto Matta. It unquestionably reflects a talent snuffed out way before its time.
 
Serge Kliaving
Koury-Wingate
578 Broadway (near Prince Street)
Through today
This odd and not entirely satisfying show is the first New York City exhibition for Serge Kliaving, a young French artist of the Conceptual persuasion. Mr. Kliaving seems both suspicious of, yet entranced by, the look of corporate logos, symbols and flags, and uses them to fashion an art that can be both amusing and critical.
To one of the best-known international symbols he adds a visible twist. ''Red Cross Committee'' is a row of 17 brightly beautiful red crosses, painted in acrylic on canvas, that ends subversively - with a quote from the Swiss-French writer Andre Durand about the ''inequality between the one who gives and the one who receives.'' Elsewhere, Mr. Kliaving creates his own logos and the issues to go with them. His ''Save the Martians Campaign'' seems intended to poke fun at environmentalists while also calling attention to the pollution of outer space.
On the visual front, Mr. Kliaving's art has a slightly deprived look that seems deliberate, as if the artist wants it to suggest that it was produced by some ministry of information. This style may have possibilities, but at this point it lacks the sharpness of the artist's ideas.
 
'American Moderns'
Barbara Mathes Gallery
851 Madison Avenue (near 70th
Street)
Through Jan. 23
Gallery group shows abound at this time of year. Some are thematic, some merely advertise the gallery's area of interest, but, with luck, they also present some of its back-room gems. This exhibition achieves the last.
Among its standouts is Arthur Dove's 1926 ''Sea Thunder (Sea Gull Motif),'' one of the best paintings from the artist's 1975 retrospective at the Whitney Museum of American Art. Although one must ignore the burdensome white post-modern frame, the painting is a radiant field, half black, half white, that fuses the gentle undulations of cloud, wave and sea-gull wing while also giving visual form to that aural phenomenon, the echo.
Also noteworthy are three figure drawings from the 1920's by the sculptor Elie Nadelman that give the phrase ''economy of line'' particular truth, and a colorful 1914 pastel by Joseph Stella that attests to the artist's affinity for Futurism.
But the show's high point is a small painting from around 1927 by Helen Torr, the artist who was Dove's second wife. Titled ''Flower Rhythm,'' it is a prismatic abstraction of curving criss-crossing lines and shaded pinks and yellows that appears to be based on the form of a tulip bloom. It is a gem of a back-room gem, one that suggests that the history of American art made before World War II is still not thoroughly known.

HEADLINE: FIGHTING IN PANAMA;
Cities Are Looters' Jungles As Chaos Consumes Panama

BYLINE: By LINDSEY GRUSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PANAMA, Dec. 22

 BODY:
Two days after United States forces invaded the country, Panama appeared close to anarchy as bands of looters and roving gunmen took over and ravaged one neighborhood after another.
Ricardo Arias Calderon, the newly installed junior Vice President in the American-backed government, narrowly escaped assassination this afternoon when shots were fired as he left the National Assembly building, senior aides said.
Mr. Calderon, a Christian Democrat whose election earlier this year was annulled by the regime of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, was not injured. The officials said that the shots were fired from a truck by several men who appeared to be members of a paramilitary group. 
Two bodyguards were slightly injured in the attack, they said.
Looters have swarmed through Panama City's downtown business district, leaving an ankle-deep carpet of glass shards that made many sidewalks all but impassable.
In some areas, hardly a window pane was to be seen as looters ran through the streets searching for remnants overlooked in previous attacks.
''Merry Christmas,'' many of them shouted at passers-by. Some looters chanted ''Viva Panama'' as a convoy of U.S. troops rumbled down the road.
Some store owners took up rifles and stood guard in front of their shops.
Other areas of the capital seemed close to civil war, with supporters and opponents of General Noriega, the deposed strongman, shooting at anyone they suspected of sympathizing with the other side.
An atmosphere of chaos has spread across the isthmus, turning cities into war grounds and provoking sharp criticism of the American invasion, even by opponents of the Noriega regime.
Many of these civilians had previously called for United States military intervention. ''The country is being destroyed to save it,'' said a civil engineer who has long criticized General Noriega and initially supported United States military intervention. ''Washington never thought about the social consequences. This country is deeply scarred.'' American officials said they had dispatched 1,500 military police in an attempt to establish some order in the capital and halt the looting.
But they said that the invasion force was still concentrating on flushing out supporters of General Noriega and seizing their weapons.
''To completely clean out the entire city is going to take months of work,'' said Col. James Snell, a senior American military commander.
The United States sent 2,000 soldiers to Panama today to reinforce its invasion force of 24,000.
Sporadic fighting continued with reports that forces loyal to General Noriega continued to hold some sections of northwestern Panama. Many officers in the Panama Defense Forces were surrendering to United States officials and taking oaths of loyalty to the new Government.
''We want to fight for Endara,'' one officer said, referring to the new President, Guillermo Endara.
 
Fear of Guerrilla War
American troops appear to have seized all of their major military and Government targets. But their failure to prevent hit-and-run raids is threatening to turn the sniping into a full-scale guerrilla war against the American military presence.
Soldiers said that planes approaching the runway at Howard Air Force Base were being fired upon by snipers hiding in the hills. A chartered plane that flew in from Miami this morning with about 200 journalists was hit at least twice.
Late this afternoon, American planes started dropping leaflets in the city encouraging forces loyal to the General to surrender. The papers guaranteed ''safe conduct'' to any United States medical facility, as well as food and shelter, to anyone presenting the leaflet.
''Remember, you need not suffer any longer,'' the pamphlet said.
But the invasion has stirred nationalist feeling among many Panamanians. Although American troops were greeted with cheers in some neighborhoods, criticism of military intervention appears to be growing, even among Panamanians who reject General Noriega's effort to portray himself as a defender of the flag.
 
'I Have My Bags Packed'
''I have my bags packed,'' said a lecturer at the national university who is planning to go to New York or Miami. ''If I was a military man, I'd go to the mountains, not because I support Noriega, but because of the nation. It's like being raped.''
A few Americans who were seized in the initial hours of the invasion were still missing today. American officials declined to discuss their cases for fear of jeopardizing prospects for their release.
The United States troops were still frustrated in pursuing their primary goal, the capture of General Noriega. He was variously rumored to have taken shelter in a sympathetic embassy, to be leading loyal forces from a headquarters in the countryside, or to have fled with a band of loyalists into neighboring Costa Rica. None of those reports could be confirmed.
 
From Allies to Enemies
The invasion, which United States officials acknowledge has run into difficulties, began early Wednesday with a three-pronged attack on major military targets across the country.
The invasion, the largest American combat operation since the end of the Vietnam war, followed two years of worsening relations between the two countries, who were once allies.
The breach widened after the indictment of General Noriega last year on Federal drug trafficking charges. The general has denied the charges, but prosecutors have said their case is strong.
In what was originally planned as a quick and painless campaign to oust General Noriega, Washington imposed diplomatic, economic and military sanctions against Panama. But the effort backfired.
The United States succeeded in isolating the military regime. But its effort wrecked a once-flourishing economy and allowed the general, an acknowledged master of military intelligence, to tighten his grip on power and prepare for American military intervention.

Soviets Welcome the Uprising Against Ceausescu

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Dec. 22

 BODY:
The Government today hailed the routing of the Ceausescu regime as ''the will of the Rumanian people'' and expressed its support of Rumanians' demands for democracy.
The Foreign Minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, expressed sympathy at the loss of life in the Rumanian uprising and the support of Russians after a meeting with the United States Ambassador, Jack F. Matlock.
Russians sat rapt tonight as the main national news show, Vremya, presented vivid television dispatches from Bucharest showing a huge crowd in the city square celebrating the downfall of the Ceausescu government. By the end of the show, however, fresh dispatches arrived reporting a night attack on the unarmed street crowds by the still resistant security forces of the deposed Rumanian leader. 
The report was some of the most uninhibited allowed thus far by the state-controlled television in its careful coverage of the wave of democratic rebellion that has swept the Soviet Union's Eastern European allies.
 
'Will of the Rumanian People'
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev did not personally comment on the day's events, but he presided over a session of the national congress that expressed sympathy with the Rumanian public's desire for democracy.
''The Soviet Union regards these events as the expression of the will of the Rumanian people, which is working for the renovation of its society on the principles of democracy,'' Mr. Shevardnadze declared in his statement.
''The Soviet people at this important moment for the Rumanian socialist movement express their support to the Rumanian people and sincere sympathy for the loss of human life.''
Nicolae Ceausescu was long at odds with the Kremlin, most recently in defending his hard-line suppression of the Rumanian public as he opposed the democratization changes sweeping through most of the Communist bloc in Eastern Europe. He had led his nation into a maverick position critical of the Soviet Union two decades ago. He supported China during the Chinese-Soviet split and condemned the Soviet-led invasion of Prague in 1968 by Warsaw Pact troops who put down a popular uprising for democracy.
The Kremlin's heightened dislike for Mr. Ceausescu's government was clear for the past two days when Tass, the Soviet press agency, filed dispatches from Bucharest that were notably sympathetic to the crowds of Rumanians.
 
Benefit Seen for Gorbachev
Tass has often been a primary source for the latest news of the uprising. It was quoted with credibility in many Western news accounts as it reported with many bulletins of firsthand information from its Bucharest correspondent on the routing of ''Ceausescu and his clique,'' the ''victory of the Rumanian people in the struggle against dictatorship,'' and, more ominously tonight, the resistance and crowd attacks by Ceausescu's loyalists in the security police.
''The Rumanian people were happy to hear that the Soviet people and peoples' deputies were closely following the developments in Rumania and supporting the Rumaninan people's fight for freedom,'' Tass reported.
Western diplomats said the fall of Mr. Ceausescu regime was of considerable immediate benefit to Mr. Gorbachev.
''This removes an irritant and will leave a more amenable government that will permit better relations,'' said one analyst, who said the sight of the demonstrators in Bucharest would not necessarily compound the slight but growing popular pressure on the Soviet Government to begin yielding to calls for an end to the Communist Party's continuing monopoly on power.
 
Setback for Conservatives
Such a yielding has been one of the characteristic early changes in the collapse of the Eastern European governments. But some analysts insist that Mr. Gorbachev has time to maneuver along the slower pace of democratization that he has set here and that as the originator of the liberalized sense of popular protest that was a factor in the East block governments' collapse, he should be the last to have to face it himself.
''Now the conservatives in the Politburo have one less conservative regime out there to side with when they try to criticize Gorbachev,'' said a Western diplomat, stressing that there still was no sign that the Soviet public was ready to take to the streets to press Mr. Gorbachev for multiparty democratic politics and for improved economic conditions.
This morning, the Soviet Congress of Peoples' Deputies passed a measure expressing its ''great sorrow'' and concern over the deaths reported in the fall of the Rumanian Government.
''We hope that in the nearest future the possibility for peaceful settlement of the existing problems in the spirit of tolerance, humanism and respect to human rights will be found in Rumania,'' the congress declared in the measure, which was passed with 1,809 deputies in favor. There was no immediate explanation why 32 other deputies voted to oppose the statement and 65 abstained.

Bush Promises to Help If Rumanians Change

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 22

 BODY:
The Bush Administration said today that it was prepared to extend to Rumania the kind of assistance granted to Poland and Hungary if the government that emerges in Bucharest adopts similar political and economic reforms.
President Bush called the ouster of President Nicolae Ceausescu a ''dramatic change.'' And the White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said:
''Today, Dec. 22, a terrible burden appears to have been lifted from Rumania: the burden of dictatorial rule. The United States shares the rejoicing of the Rumanian people and joins them in their hopes for a peaceful transition toward democracy. We hope the Rumanian Government will now move quickly to respond to the demands of its people for democratic change. If Rumania moves along a path of general democratic reform, the United States pledges its strong support and assistance.'' 
While Mr. Fitzwater declined to elaborate on what form the assistance might take, Administration officials said they were thinking along the lines of the economic aid and incentives granted to Poland and Hungary.
 
A Sense of Powerlessness
The officials conceded, though, that as with the popular uprisings in Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, East Germany and Bulgaria, they were powerless to shape events in Rumania and were watching the uprising unfold there on Cable News Network, much as the rest of the world is.
Not only are they powerless to influence events, officials said, but they think the future in Rumania will not turn out as well as that in neighboring Eastern European countries.
''More than in any other Eastern European country, we are not sure what we will end up with in Rumania,'' a senior Administration official said. ''Ceausescu was a real Stalinist and his family had totally dominated the country, more than any other leader in Eastern Europe. There were no institutions, like the church in East Germany or Solidarity in Poland, where reformists could develop. There was the Ceausescu family and nothing else, and with them gone there is going to be a real power vacuum. You cannot be certain how that vacuum will be filled, at what pace, and by whom.''
 
Concerns About Violence
Administration officials said intelligence reports suggest that there is still a substantial chance of violence among the Rumanians, between rival elements of the army and the security forces, and involving people who want to take revenge on Government forces.
Despite the unpredictability of events in Rumania, the Foreign Ministers of the European Community took immediate action to provide emergency assistance. After a special meeting summoned by the French Foreign Minister, Roland Dumas, the Europeans issued a statement saying: ''So that Rumania can reclaim its destiny, the European Community and its member states solemnly reaffirm their will to give it the immediate aid and cooperation of which the Ceausescu regime has unjustly deprived it.'' Mr. Dumas said later the aid would be given in food.
Administration officials and analysts said the fall of President Ceausescu would affect both American strategic interests in Eastern Europe and American perceptions of the Soviet President, Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
''Now all the dominoes in Eastern Europe have fallen except the big one - the Soviet Union,'' said Michael Mandelbaum, an expert on Eastern Europe at the Council on Foreign Relations. ''This is undoubtedly going to influence the debate in the West about Mikhail Gorbachev. Gorbachev has gotten enormous credibility by allowing and encouraging reform in Eastern Europe, and the more he does that, the less the Soviet Union is regarded as a threat. But the more democratization spreads in Eastern Europe, the more the Soviet Union is going to stand out starkly as the laggard.
''When Gorbachev began, he was doing things that no one in Eastern Europe was doing; now the Eastern Europeans are leaving him in the dust,'' Mr. Mandelbaum went on. ''That is bound to affect the debate about how much we should help Gorbachev.''
 
A Momentum for Change
But at the same time, an Administration official said, the events in Rumania should embolden people advocating reform in the Soviet Union, as opposed to those arguing for a slower pace of change.
''If there is one conclusion that the Soviets should draw from Rumania,'' a senior Administration official said, ''it is that the tide of reform is irresistible. Ceausescu thought he could be different, but the lesson of today is that you cannot hold back the pressure for change. If you try, the costs become too great and those who oppose reform become the chief victims. That is going to create a certain momentum for change in Moscow.''
On the strategic level, the fall of Mr. Ceausescu's government further weakens the Warsaw Pact as a military alliance, some analysts said. It is now virtually inconceivable, Administration officials said, that East Germany, Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia and Rumania would join to pose a military threat to the West. This will only underscore the need, articulated by Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d in his Berlin speech last week, for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to adopt more political and economic functions if it is to remain a cohesive and relevant alliance in the face of a diminishing Soviet-bloc threat, officials said.
 
'Last of the Dominoes'
''The last of the Warsaw Pact dominoes in Eastern Europe has fallen,'' said Charles Gati, an expert on Eastern Europe at Union College in upstate New York. ''The Warsaw Pact as a united military force is finished. It means that we have to create a new rationale for political cooperation within the Atlantic alliance. Of course, we cannot completely let our guard down. Communism has lost, but democracy has not won yet.''
Asked about the status of the Rumanian Ambassador in Washington, Ion Stoichici, a State Department spokesman, Richard Boucher, said: ''The present Ambassador sort of remains in place until we've received notification from the Rumanian Government that he's been changed and a new person has been appointed.''
About 50 Rumanians, led by Father George Calciu of the Rumanian Faith and Freedom Coalition, demanded that the Rumanian Embassy be turned over to them, but the State Department refused and the building is being guarded by American diplomatic security agents. Rumanian diplomats did not answer the embassy telephone today, and kept the windows curtained.

HEADLINE: Fighting in Panama: Peru;
Protest by Lima Asks U.S. to Halt Anti-Drug Drive

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO Dec. 22

 BODY:
Protesting American military action in Panama, Peru has requested that the United States suspend its anti-drug operations in Peru's coca-growing areas, an American narcotics official in Lima said today.
The official said the United States was suspending its participation in a $10 million program to eradicate coca bushes in Peru's Upper Huallaga Valley, the source of the raw material for about half of the world's cocaine.
''The Government of Peru has requested that we temporarily suspend all field operations involving use of United States Government equipment and personnel in the Upper Huallaga area until the conflictive situation in Panama is resolved,'' said the American Embassy official, who asked not to be identified.
 
Garcia Won't Attend Summit
The suspension comes after Peru's President, Alan Garcia Perez, protested the American action in Panama by withdrawing his Ambassador in Washington and by canceling his participation in an anti-drug summit with President Bush in Colombia on Feb. 15. 
''How can I meet with a President who has just trampled Latin America?'' Mr. Garcia said to reporters. ''Holding a dialogue with a pistol on the table cannot be tolerated.''
Referring to the American military action in Panama, Mr. Garcia said on Thursday that the United States ''could seek to do the same in Peru if it should think the Government isn't doing enought to fight drug trafficking.''
Later on Thursday, the United States Ambassador, Thomas Quainton, told the Lima newspaper Expresso that officers of the Drug Enforcement Administration remained in the country. ''They are ready to maintain their normal rhythm of operation in the Upper Huallaga,'' Mr. Quainton said, ''but we suppose that we will have to wait for the withdrawal of our troops from Panama.''
In one of the rare street demonstrations against the American military action, hundreds of protesters marched in downtown Lima on Thursday night and burned an American flag in front of the American Embassy.
 
Bolivia Condemns Intervention
In neighboring Bolivia, President Jaime Paz Zamora said today that he condemned the military intervention and demanded the withdrawal of American troops.
Bolivia is a major recipient of American aid in the war on cocaine trafficking, and Mr. Zamora is to attend the summit in Colombia. Today, Bolivia's Foreign Minister, Carlos Iturralde, said the Government was studying a request from Mr. Garcia to boycott the meeting with President Bush.
In Colombia, the country that is to be the host of the Andean drug summit, Julio Londono Paredes, the Foreign Minister, said today, ''No country can assume the right to intervene, directly or indirectly, in another state's affairs, whatever reasons or puposes it may have, much less militarily.''
While most of Latin America's reactions have been limited to diplomatic protest notes, street protests have taken place in Mexico, Cuba and the Dominican Republic as well as Peru.
In Mexico City, about 2,000 people shouting, ''Yankee killers!'' and ''American terrorirsm!'' gathered outside the American Embassy on Thursday night. The demonstrators spattered the Embassy's white marble facade with blue and red paint, the colors of Panama's flag.
In the Dominican Republic, the site of American military intervention in 1965, about 200 protesters picketed the United States Embassy in Santo Domingo.
 
Denunciation From Castro
Officially sanctioned protests took place on Wednesday and Thursday in Cuba, a nation whose Communist Government survived an American-sponsored invasion in 1961.
Today, Cuba's President, Fidel Castro, denounced the American action in Panama as ''in the style of the Nazis and of the fascists.''
Mr. Castro, who disapproves of the democratic opening in Eastern Europe, also complained, ''We haven't heard any of the socialist countries of Europe even talk about the attack on Panama in recent days.''
The Cuban leader, who has provided funds and training for guerrilla groups in Latin America for almost 30 years, predicted, ''If the Panamanian patriots learned the lesson of Nicaragua, of the F.M.L.N. in El Salvador, the United States forces are going to remain mired for who knows how long in this little country.''
''The great army of the great empire is looking stupid,'' Mr. Castro concluded in his first public comment on the American invasion.
 
'IT'S THEIR COUNTRY,' U.S. SAYS
WASHINGTON, Dec. 22 (Special to the New York Times) A State Department official said today that Peru's lack of cooperation left the American Government ''no choice,'' because ''it's their country and it's a joint operation.''
Robert P. Myers, director for program management in the department's narcotics bureau, emphasized that the United States decision to suspend the anti-drug operation was not a retaliatory action but a result of the Peruvian Government's desire not to participate. ''It was not our decision to do this,'' he said.
Administration officials said the summit was still on. ''It would possibly enhance the considerations if they were there,'' Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said of the Peruvians on Thursday. ''But we will continue to go ahead and meet.''
Administration officials said the suspension of joint anti-drug activities were not expected to affect economic aid programs to Peru that were not conditioned on the drug effort.

HEADLINE: Atlanta in Contrast: Civil Rights and Racial Hate

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Dec. 22

 BODY:
Atlanta likes to call itself the home of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and the civil rights movement, but the area surrounding it is home to some of the most prominent white supremacists in the nation.
They and their followers, many of whom have long-running disagreements with the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, and some of its rulings on race and school desegregation, are a focus of attention in the investigation of four bombing incidents in the South since last Saturday. Investigators have determined that all four bombs were mailed from northern Georgia, but they stressed that did not mean the assailants live in Georgia.
And although officials insist that the investigation remains open-ended, it is casting attention on a darker side of the Atlanta area, which has often symbolized some of most positive changes in race in America. 
 
Examing Possible Racial Motive
Federal agents are seeking a racial motive in the four bombing incidents, including the explosions that killed a Federal appellate judge and a Savannah lawyer. The other bombs were delivered but removed safely from the offices of the 11th Circuit in Atlanta and the N.A.A.C.P. office in Jacksonville, Fla.
Atlanta had as peaceful an experience with integration as any major city in the South. But the area's history and current politics remain suffused with issues of race. If Atlanta is the home of Dr. King, nearby Stone Mountain was also where the Ku Klux Klan was revived in 1915, and Atlanta became the headquarters of the revived Klan.
Klan marches remain common sideshows in the area, although most activity is outside the city. A Klan telephone line today carried a recorded message urging followers to turn out Jan. 6 at the State Capitol here to protest the holiday honoring Dr. King, who was described with racial slurs and labeled ''Communist scum and sex pervert.''
Some civil rights figures like the Rev. Joseph Lowery, president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, say the black gains and prominence in Atlanta may serve as a source of tension and frustration for some whites. Political power in Atlanta, which is now 70 percent black, is dominated by blacks like Mayor Andrew Young and Mayor-elect Maynard Jackson.
But Dr. Lowery and others say the hate groups remain fringe movements with no more influence in the Atlanta area than anywhere else.
 
'Just a Matter of Population'
''If there are more of them here, it's because there are more people here,'' said Stuart Lewengrub, southeast director of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith. ''It's just a matter of population. This is the population hub of the South, so it's the hub of some of the bad things in the South as well as the good.''
Much of the ire of white supremacists is directed at the Federal judiciary in general and the 11th Circuit in particular. The court has ruled on several cases involving the Klan and prominent white supremacists like J. B. Stoner, who lives near Atlanta, and Roger Handley, an Alabama Ku Klux Klan leader. It has ruled on desegration cases in Jacksonville and Savannah as well as DeKalb County near Atlanta.
The issues have touched a raw nerve with hate groups.
For example, a message left on the answering machine of Daniel Carver, Georgia Grand Dragon of the Invisible Empire Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, in September and taped by the Southern Poverty Law Center of Montgomery, Ala., extolled a planned ''whites only'' demonstration in Jasper, Ga., with a barrage of racial slurs. The message concluded: ''White people are sick and tired of their schools being destroyed. Children can't possibly concentrate on getting an education. Their main goal is just making it through the day without being attacked by a savage nigger.''
A Klan newspaper, The Cross and the Sword, in 1987 ran an item on a civil rights case involving Mr. Handley, lambasting a ruling by what it referred to as ''the Jew-controlled 11th Circuit Court of Appeals.''
 
Violent Rhetoric Is a Staple
And in their rhetoric, at least, white supremecists have long threatened violent action.
In a speech at an annual Labor Day Klan rally in Stone Mountain near Atlanta in 1985 another white supremacist leader, Frank Shirley, said, ''It's always refreshing to see more cases of white vigilantes.'' He added: ''Death to the race mixers. They have whirled down the gauntlet at our feet.''
The speech, tape-recorded by law enforcement officials and obtained by the Southern Povery Law Center, concludes: ''When the hour of retribution strikes, there will be 10 million dead ones in America.''
The leading white supremacists in Georgia remain fringe figures, most of them in suburbs or small towns outside Atlanta, with little influence on mainstream life. Among them are Mr. Stoner, who was convicted in 1980 of a 1958 bombing incident in Birmingham, and his longtime associate, Ed Fields, who publishes a newsletter called The Truth at Last. Prominent Klansmen, several of whom received a $940,000 judgment for attacking civil rights marchers that was upheld by the 11th Circuit, include Mr. Carver and Dave Holland, who called his Southern White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan ''the most militant white racist Klan organization in the country.''
But officials of the Federal Bureau of Investigation have not said if they have any suspects in the bombings, and past and current Klan members deny they or their associates were involved.
 
Klan Leader Denies Bombings
''There are two different mentalities in the Klan,'' said Edward Stephens, a former Grand Dragon of the Invisible Empire Knights of the Ku Klux Klan in Georgia. ''The one type that might have enough sense to know how to make such a thing as a bomb have better things to do with their time. The different class, the unemployed street bums, the bad apples in the Klan, don't have enough intelligence to know how to deliver such a bomb.''
He said he had not been contacted by the F.B.I. but would be glad to answer any questions and added that he could understand frustration with the 11th Circuit.
''I hate to see what happened to the judge and all that but the 11th Circuit with the lawsuit we had really distorted the law,'' he said. ''They were just so biased and liberal about it. A majority of it is dominated by extreme liberals.''
Officials familiar with Klan activity in Georgia said such a high level of violence would be uncharacteristic. The state has several Klan organizations, many of which have splintered from one another. Some speculated that if white supremacists are involved, they might not be involved with high-profile white supremacist activities or traditional groups like the Klan.

HEADLINE: Bitter Coal Strike May Be at End, but Ripples From Dispute Are Widely Felt

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS

 BODY:
Children of striking coal miners might not get the Barbie dolls and Nintendo games they asked for this Christmas, but officials on both sides said yesterday that after nine months of a bitter labor dispute, the miners might soon have a contract.
Negotiators, who have been meeting around the clock since Wednesday, continued intense talks yesterday in Washington, and the Department of Labor three times said an announcement was imminent.
Spokesmen for the participants would only say that a news conference would be held concerning important developments. Although the Labor Department canceled each announcement it scheduled, officials from both sides who were not in the meetings said last night that they were ready for an announcement at any time.
On one side is one of the fastest declining unions in the nation, the United Mine Workers of America, which was founded 99 years ago and had a half million active members in 1946. Today, after decades of mechanization and a spurt in nonunion mining, the union has 63,000 working members who mine only a third of the nation's coal. 
If the miners lose the strike, their leaders say it would wipe out the union, bring chaos to the coal industry and ultimately leave 125,000 retired miners and their beneficiaries without health benefits.
On the other side is the Pittston Coal Group, the nation's 17th largest producer. Before the strike it was considered modestly profitable, but said it needed concessions on health benefits to remain competitive.
If the company cannot obtain the concessions, Wall Street analysts say Pittston would probably stop mining coal or sell its coal operations. Spending Millions Because of a Strike The strike has hit both sides hard.
Pittston hired replacements for striking workers and has restored production to almost what it was before the walkout. But the company says it spent $20 million on security and fenced-in trailer parks for the new workers. Analysts estimate the company has lost more than $60 million on the strike, a figure some anaylsts say would take decades to recoup with concessions.
The union has been depleting its $90 million strike fund with $225 weekly strike pay for its members. It faces more than $64 million in fines imposed for members' acts of violence, civil disobedience and destruction of Pittston property. The Russell County Circuit Court in Lebanon, Va., established an escalating scale for the fines, and each strike-related traffic violation now costs the union $500,000.
The issue of paying the soaring cost of health benefits is the most important one for union labor today, said Morton Bahr, president of the Communications Workers of America. This month his union ended a strike against Nynex after the company withdrew its demand that workers pay a greater share of health-care costs.
National union leaders say the outcome of the Pittston strike will set the tone for collective bargaining in the 1990's, but at a Christmas party in southwest Virginia this week, the concerns were much more immediate.
''When you look at the kids' eyes, you can see all the worry the strike puts on the family and this community,'' said Rickey E. Blaylock, a former professional wrestler (''The Mountain Mauler'') and a local official of the United Mine Workers of America. He wore a Santa's suit on Sunday in the shell of a former supermarket here and, at the end of a day filled with 2,000 wishes, his voice wavered.
Children listing what they wanted for Christmas said their biggest hopes were for dolls, electronic video games, and a union contract for their fathers.
Miners, dressed in the striker's belligerent uniform of military camouflage fatigues, spoke in interviews of being arrested without cause, of walking picket lines in 3-degree weather and of making sacrifices to get by on strike pay of $225 a week.
They talked of battling a conglomerate corporation that wants to take away health benefits and job security that their fathers and grandfathers fought for 40 years ago. They said the union and their lives would be wrecked if they do not win the strike.
Wildcat strikes this summer, involving 45,000 miners, or 5 of every 7 union coal miners in the country, have underscored the high emotions of the union members. On a community level, the strike has ruined businesses, impoverished families, turned neighbor against neighbor and local police against state police.
A mediator, William J. Usery Jr., Secretary of Labor under President Gerald R. Ford, was appointed by the Bush Administration in November to try to resolve the deadlock. Union Tactics Lead to Arrests Civil disobedience and passive resistance have been the union's primary tools in the strike. The State Police in Virginia have made 2,886 arrests for actions like impeding the movement of Pittston coal trucks and occupying a company coal preparation plant for four days. Pittstson hired new workers for 25 mines and plants in Virginia and West Virginia but closed indefinitly three plants in Kentucky.
Although many demonstrations took place around the headquarters of the company's coal operations in Lebanon, Va., others were held in Greenwich, Conn., where The Pittston Company, the coal group's parent company, is based. Other Pittston subsidiaries are Burlington Air Express, Brink's Inc., and Brinks Home Security.
Some say the Virginia state police have overreacted. Avery W. Phipps, sheriff of Dickenson County, Va., complained in a letter to Gov. Gerald L. Baliles in August that the state police were enforcing ''martial law'' and treating strikers in ways that the ''Humane Society would not tolerate in treatment of animals.'' The State Police investigated his complaint and found it unfounded.
Other critics pointed to the example of Sister Bernadette Kenny, a 50-year-old Catholic nun, who was arrested by a Federal marshal for driving her mobile health clinic too slowly in front of a coal truck last July. She said she was handcuffed for two hours and jailed for six hours before being released on a $10,000 bond. Federal charges were dismissed in September when the driver of the coal truck testified on her behalf.
Violence has frequently erupted, resulting in 3,000 broken winshields, burned vehicles, assaults, cut power lines, dynamite explosions and 211 felony arrests in Virginia alone. In mid-December, someone dressed in camouflage fired a shotgun at a Pittston truck, blew out the windshield and wounded the driver.
Hate and desperation are palpable in mining communities of Southwest Virginia, even 1,200 feet underground where temporary replacement workers are mining coal from the Jawbone Seam at Pittston's McClure Mine No. 1 near Clinchco, Va. ''My next-door neighbor calls me a scab and the union people tried to burn my house down,'' said a young miner eating his lunch in the near darkness of the mine.
The miner said he has to endure the harrassment to support his family. He earns $15 an hour, several times his pay at a landscaping company before joining Pittston last summer. He said he had been a union member for six years, but like a dozen other replacement workers interviewed, he had a raft of complaints about the union.
The most frequent complaints were that union leaders called strikes for the slightest infraction of complex work rules and that it was impossible for a young miner to get a union job because there were thousands of laid-off miners who are older, had ve more seniority and would get first crack.
''I got to make a living, too,'' said David G. Dupont, another replacement worker and a former union member who had been unable to find a union job since 1984. Since then he has been unemployed or worked minimum wage jobs. ''My family comes first; it's every man for himself now.'' Rallying Cause For Faltering Movement The strike comes at a time when the labor movement is in worse shape than it was in the 1920's, said Richard B. Freeman, a professor of economics at Harvard and director of labor studies at the National Bureau of Economic Research, a private research organization.
He said that union labor has fallen from a high point of 40 percent of the private work force in the mid-1950's to 12 percent today, and he estimated that union labor will fall to 5 percent of the private work force by the the year 2000. ''If the only way we can compete is by reducing the living standards of our blue collar citizens, that is nothing any of us can be proud of,'' Professor Freeman said.
The strike has also become a rallying cause. ''This strike is important for the morale of the labor movement,'' said Douglas A. Fraser, former president of the United Automobile Workers and now a professor of labor studies at Wayne State University.
Richard L. Trumka, president of the miners union, has rallied the public and unions behind his cause by couching the economic issues in moral terms and by playing up the importance of complete health care coverage for people who work in one of the nation's most dangerous occupations.
Government statistics indicate that there are about 55 deaths and 10,000 to 16,000 injuries each year as a result of explosions, cave-ins and other mine accidents. In addition, 4,000 miners die each year from lung diseases that result from inhaling dust from coal and other minerals.
''This strike is about health benefits that the company says it can afford to pay,'' Mr. Trumka said, during a break from the bargaining table in Arlington, Va. ''But the company would rather walk away from commitments it made over the past 30 to 40 years.'' Agreement on Benefits: The Background Every national contract since 1950 has required companies to provide complete health coverage to miners as well as to retired miners, disabled miners and their widows and orphans. John L. Lewis, then the union president, negotiated this landmark contract in exchange for allowing coal operators to introduce mechanized equipment that would ultimately eliminate 300,000 jobs.
Under the agreement, companies pay for their own employee benefits and make contributions to a multi-employer fund that provides benefits for retirees, no matter which company had employed them last. The union subsequently amended this agreement and now permits companies to pay retirement benefits directly to their employees who retired after 1976. But another fund, supported by company contributions, was established for miners who retired after 1976 from companies that went out of business.
The pension funds have done well, but the benefit funds have a deficit of more than $60 million, which is increasing at the rate of $6 million a month. Last year, companies were asked to contribute $1.92 per employee an hour worked; now that contribution has increased to $2.94.
Pittston has balked at these rising costs and a union contract that it says stifles productivity. ''Any number of industry experts will tell you that the U.M.W.A. mines impose a cost penalty ranging from $3 to $6 a ton over nonunion competition,'' said Michael E. Odom, president of Pittston Coal Group. ''The U.M.W.A. medical plan is a runaway program and it has to be adapted to the real world. The U.M.W.A. contract imposes archaic, inefficient practices and impediments. We have got to reduce our overall costs by improving productivity.''
In 1987, Pittston withdrew from the Bituminous Coal Operators Association, the bargaining organization for unionized companies, and rejected the contract that covered the period from 1988 to 1993.
Pittston then offered its miners a contract with a wage increase of 90 cents an hour over three years, an increase that was slightly larger than one in the national contract and one that would bring the average weekly paycheck to $634. The company contract would have reduced medical benefits from 100 percent coverage to 80 percent coverage and the number of paid holidays and sick days from 45 to 35 for an employee who has been with the company for 15 years.
The contract also would have given the company wide flexibility in scheduling shifts, including new night shifts on Sunday, and would have permitted the company to have nonunion contractors take over many union jobs involving the repair of equipment, transportation of coal, construction of mining facilities, maintenance of idled mines and laboratory work.
The union worked without a contract for 14 months and then went on strike April 5, 1989. In July, the National Labor Relations Board issued a complaint against the company charging it with unfair labor practices involving its failure to bargain, unlawful discharge of workers and unilateral implementation of contract provisions. As a result of the complaint, which will have a hearing next year, the company cannot permanently replace its striking workers and must restore jobs to the strikers after the dispute is settled. 'A Dead Limb On a Tree' The Rev. Harry P. Whitaker, pastor of the Straight Holler Free Will Baptist Church in Dante, Va., and a miner who retired from Pittston after 31 years, said he has complained about Pittston's actions on national television, radio and at a Pittston shareholder meeting. ''Pittston promised me that if I worked for them for 20 years, they would take care of my health for life,'' he said, as he leaned on a cane at a recent union rally in Castlewood, Va.
''But now they say, 'Harry Whitaker, you ain't working for us any more. You got black lung. You can't sleep at night. You got a bad heart. Your hips are crushed. You can't walk good. You're like a dead limb on a tree. You're not bringing in any fruit any more. We're breaking our promise to pay your medical bills.''
Mr. Whitaker said he had to tap his $402-a-month pension from Pittston to cover medical costs, like doctor's visits, that Pittston's new benefit plan did not cover.
Competitors are just as angry as the retirees. ''Pittston is simply trying to dump its unfunded employee liabilities on the rest of the industry and it's very devastating on us,'' said Robert E. Murray, president and chief executive officer of The Ohio Valley Coal Company, a privately owned company in Alledonia, Ohio.
Mr. Odom, Pittston's president, said, ''The funds are insolvent because the U.M.W.A. has priced itself out of business and there are fewer companies left to pay the benefits.''
No matter how the strike is resolved, labor specialists say that it has built a new grass-roots movement by attracting the support of a thousand unions, religious organizations, clergy members and community groups.
''If we are unsuccessful after this super effort,'' said Mr. Trumka, the union president, ''what does that say about the state of collective bargaining?''

HEADLINE: Fire Director, Budget Chief Are Selected

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
Filling the post that he has called his top priority, Mayor-elect David N. Dinkins yesterday named the executive director of the state's Financial Control Board, Philip R. Michael, as his Budget Director. Mr. Dinkins also named a career firefighter, Carlos M. Rivera, to be Fire Commissioner.
The appointment of Mr. Michael, a former City Finance Commissioner who, as head of the control board since last year has been responsible for monitoring the city's budget, seems intended to reassure business leaders that Mr. Dinkins is prepared to weather uncertain fiscal times.
Mr. Rivera, a member of the Fire Department for 31 years and its Chief of Operations since October, would become the first Hispanic commissioner in the department's 124-year history. Chief Rivera would also help round out the ''gorgeous mosaic'' the Mayor-elect uses as a metaphor for the city and his administration, even as he faces stiff pressure from supporters to name additional Hispanic appointees. 
 
'Vigilance Over the Bottom Line'
At a news conference announcing the appointments, which brought to 11 the number of posts he has filled, Mr. Dinkins said the naming of Mr. Michael ''should send a strong signal to the business community, to the city's bondholders and to the taxpayers that we will not relax our vigilance over the bottom line, even in difficult times.''
Stanley Hill, head of District Council 37 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, the largest city employees' union, said that he was disappointed at the choice and that he had called Mr. Dinkins to express concern about the union's past differences with Mr. Michael when he was Finance Commisssioner. ''But David assured me we would have effective communications,'' said Mr. Hill, a major supporter of Mr. Dinkins.
Nine days before he is to be sworn in, Mr. Dinkins has yet to fill critical positions like labor relations director, head of the City Planning Commission, health commissioner and human resources administrator. Mr. Dinkins said yesterday that he was satisfied with the pace and that taking care to fill posts with the right people was ''time well spent.''
Like Mr. Dinkins's appointee as First Deputy Mayor, Norman Steisel, Mr. Michael is a veteran of the Koch administration who has since worked elsewhere, most recently at the control board. The board was established in the fiscal crisis in the mid-70's. At that time it had binding powers over the city's fiscal affairs, but now performs oversight and advisory functions.
Mr. Michael said he would stress increased productivity by the municipal work force as a way to help solve impending budget gaps.
''The Mayor-elect has impressed upon me that he believes that productivity is a key element, real productivity that will go a long way toward solving the budget problem, and I concur,'' Mr. Michael said. He cited improving vehicle management, using additional one-officer patrol cars and reducing the managers in some agencies as possible options.
 
'Reordering of Priorities'
''I think there are many agency heads, when they understand the budget requirements that are going to be placed upon them, who will use their creativity to develop even further productivity goals,'' he said.
Mr. Michael and Mr. Dinkins acknowledged that productivity gains alone would probably not be enough to keep the budget balanced or afford new programs in the face of faltering tax revenues and virtually no growth in the economy.
''There's no doubt there's going to be some reordering of priorities,'' Mr. Michael said. ''And everybody can't have everything.'' He said that he did not believe a tax increase was ''a necessary element to balancing the budget,'' but that it could not be ruled out.
Later, Mr. Steisel said the incoming adminstration was committed to reviewing ideas for increased productivity, even those, like one-officer patrol cars, that have been considered for years without being adopted.
''Some of the ideas have been out there and been discussed and been abandoned because they weren't timely,'' Mr. Steisel said. ''Some of those have to be looked at. The environment may be different, and we may want to pursue those. Some were abandoned because we didn't have imaginative management. All of that has to be reassessed in the climate of a new administration.''
 
Trying to Help Morale
Mr. Michael praised the professional staff at the budget office and said he hoped many of them would stay on. He will take office Jan. 1, replacing Paul Dickstein, who plans to leave for the private sector.
For his part, Chief Rivera said he would work to increase morale in the department, which suffered during feuds with Mayor Edward I. Koch over salaries and the closing of firehouses in the last two years. Chief Rivera said he would work to make sure safety was not jeopardized by adopting a ruling that the city won this week that allows it to use four-person pumpers instead of five-person crews.
The Chief said he did not envision using four-person crews on ladder trucks that perform high-rise rescues. ''I don't think that's a viable option,'' he said. ''We have certain standards to maintain.''
Chief Rivera sidestepped questions on whether firefighters should have a wider role in rescues and emergencies, work that is dominated in New York as in no other city by the police and that has been the subject of intense feuding in recent years.
Officials in the Koch administration proposed shifting added responsibility to the Fire Deparment, but were overruled by the Mayor, who sided with the police. Aides to Mr. Dinkins, including his new Police Commissioner, Lee P. Brown, have said they will re-examine the issue.
Asked for his personal opinion on whether firefighters could handle emergency work as well as the police, Chief Rivera said that he was ''a bit prejudiced,'' but that he thought they could. ''We can go from a water leak to a collapse to a plane crash,'' he said. ''And we respond quickly, and we're very aggressive on the scene.''

HEADLINE: As Deficit Threatens, City Hall Budget Watchdog Becomes Master

BYLINE: By RICHARD LEVINE

 BODY:
No one can say Philip R. Michael, who was named yesterday as New York City's next budget director, does not know what he is getting himself into.
Just Thursday the New York State Financial Control Board, which Mr. Michael now serves as executive director, issued a report that began, ''By now it has become abundantly clear: The 10-year boom in the city's economy that preceded the October 1987 stock market crash, and that greatly stimulated tax revenue growth, has been replaced by a disconcerting stagnation.''
That stagnation will be Mr. Michael's to cope with as he endeavors to keep the city's $26.5 billion budget balanced at a time when new resources are scarce and ills like homelessness, drug abuse and AIDS abound. The Koch administration estimates that Mr. Michael will face a budget deficit of $395 million for the fiscal year that begins in July, but others have warned that the gap could grow to several times that figure. And there may be more problems with this year's budget as well: A report from the State Comptroller's office yesterday warned of a potential gap of $185 million, although that was disputed by the departing budget director, Paul Dickstein. 
In selecting Mr. Michael for the $110,000-a-year post as Director of the city's Office of Management and Budget, Mayor-elect David N. Dinkins chose a former city finance commissioner and current fiscal monitor, whose agency was established during the crisis of the mid-1970's and has the authority to step in and control spending if the city finishes the fiscal year with a $100 million deficit.
 
Background as Tax Collector
Raymond D. Horton, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, an independent group that analyzes the city's finances, praised Mr. Michael, saying his background at the Finance Department, which collects the city's taxes, had given him a sure sense of the sometimes perplexing flow of revenues. Mr. Horton also said that while Mr. Michael was at the Financial Control Board he focused on the growth of the city work force. ''That's the thing that drives the budget,'' Mr. Horton added.
The control board's latest report, in fact, noted that even with a midyear hiring freeze, the city-financed work force grew 2.1 percent in fiscal 1989, to 219,000, which was 30 percent more than the force on the payroll in 1981.
In a telephone interview yesterday, Mr. Michael said he would ''seriously consider recommending to the Mayor no growth in the work force.''
At the news conference at which his appointment was announced, Mr. Michael also spoke of increasing the efficiency of municipal government, saying he would examine the possibility of police patrol cars with a single officer, among other ideas. ''The Mayor has impressed upon me that he believes that productivity is a key element, real productivity that will go a long way toward solving the budget problem, and I concur,'' Mr. Michael said, as Mr. Dinkins stood by his side.
 
Philosophy and Crime
Philip Roy Michael was born on Aug. 5, 1940 in San Francisco and attended the University of California at Berkeley, earning a bachelor's degree in philosophy in 1962 and a law degree in 1965. That year he moved to Washington to become a trial attorney in the United State Justice Department's Organized Crime and Racketeering Section.
In 1972 he joined the New York City Police Department as the deputy commissioner for trials. When Mayor Edward I. Koch was elected in 1978, Mr. Michael was appointed First Deputy Commissioner of the Department of Investigation and, in 1980, Finance Commissioner.
He left the city government in 1984, joining Merrill Lynch & Company as an investment banker before becoming general counsel to Sanus Health Systems, a health maintenance organization, in 1986. He joined the Financial Control Board in January 1989.
''He's obviously bright, he knows the territory and I think they found a good man for the job,'' said Mr. Dickstein of his successor.
 
Rohatyn Happy, Union Is Not
Felix G. Rohatyn, chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, called Mr. Michael ''thoroughly professional and thoroughly knowledgable.''
But Stanley Hill, head of District Council 37 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, said he was disappointed with the choice of Mr. Michael, with whom Mr. Hill said labor leaders had had ''communications problems'' and difficulties ''working out labor-management problems'' while Mr. Michael was Finance Commissioner.
But Mr. Hill said he had been reassured by Mr. Dinkins that ''we would have effective communications.''
Mr. Michael lives in the Riverdale section of the Bronx with his wife, Jean, and their three children. He said he runs ''maybe 15 miles'' and plays in several pickup basketball games a week.
But he may not have much time for that for a while. The city's financial plan, which updates the current budget and estimates revenues and expenses for the next four years, is due on Feb. 1.

HEADLINE: Orders Up Strong 5.1% For Durables

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 22

 BODY:
Bolstered by a surge in demand for aircraft and parts, orders for durable goods rose by a surprisingly strong 5.1 percent in November.
The Commerce Department said today that orders for durable goods increased to a seasonally adjusted $130.7 billion last month. Orders had dropped by seven-tenths of 1 percent in October and 1.2 percent in September. 
Aircraft orders accounted for about 40 percent of the November increase, but there were also smaller increases across several other broad categories of goods. The overall 5.1 percent rise in durables orders was the largest monthly increase since a 7.4 percent gain in December 1988, department officials said.
 
Shipments and Backlogs Up
Economists said the durable goods report, showing gains not only in orders but also in shipments and backlogs, might ease some concern about a weakening manufacturing sector.
Even excluding military orders, durable goods orders were up 4.2 percent after a rise of one-tenth of 1 percent in October. Orders for goods outside the transportation sector rose by 3.1 percent in November after falling by 1.7 percent in October.
''This confirms our belief that the fourth-quarter weakness should be temporary,'' said David Wyss, chief economist with DRI/McGraw Hill Inc. in Lexington, Mass. ''It should be bouncing back up in the first half.''
Durable goods, which are built to last three or more years, are a key part of the nation's manufacturing sector, and orders for the big-ticket items are closely watched as an indicator of the economy's health.
The United States Chamber of Commerce, representing many major manufacturing companies, said the orders rise was a delayed reaction to falling interest rates since June. ''This good news is an early Christmas present for the Fed, which has come under increasing criticism that its high interest rate policy will lead to a recession,'' said William MacReynolds, the business association's forecasting director.
Mr. Wyss of DRI/McGraw Hill also said the report should take some pressure off the Federal Reserve. ''This certainly suggests less reason to worry about a recession than some of the Fed governors, particularly Mrs. Seger, seem to think and thus less reason to ease,'' he added. A Fed governor, Martha Seger, said recently that she was worried about the possibility of a recession.
 
Unfilled Orders Increase
In today's report, the Commerce Department said that shipments of durable goods rose by 1.5 percent after October's 2 percent fall. Unfilled orders, a gauge of future activity, rose by 1.5 percent after an October gain of five-tenths of 1 percent. It was the largest one-month increase in the orders backlog since a 1.8 percent increase last December and reflected more orders for aircraft and parts.
Orders for military capital goods rose by 15.6 percent in November after a 9.1 percent drop in October. Nonmilitary capital goods, spurred by transportation orders, rose by 8.3 percent after a 1.8 percent increase in October.
Among other sectors, electrical machinery orders rose by 7.9 percent in November after a 3.6 percent October fall, while non-electrical machinery orders went up by 6.6 percent after a 4.7 percent October decline.
Primary metals orders rose by 1.7 percent in November after falling by 3.4 percent in October.

American Inventors Gained in '89

BYLINE: By Edmund L. Andrews

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
IN a reversal of a 26-year decline, American inventors this year obtained a larger share of the patents issued in the United States than they did in 1988.
This week, the Patent and Trademark Office reported that inventors based in the United States obtained 54,762 patents, or 53.3 percent of the total, a rise of six-tenths of 1 percent, in the fiscal year ended Sept. 30.
Although the improvement in share was small, the increase in the total number of patents awarded was large - 102,712 this year, compared with 83,584 in 1988. Inventors living in the United States obtained almost 24 percent more patents this year than last, coming far closer than usual to matching their Japanese counterparts, who obtained 26 percent more patents in 1989. 
Since 1963, foreign inventors, led by the Japanese, have obtained a growing share of total American patents in all but two years. In the 1988 fiscal year, the foreign share reached a high of 47.3 percent, with one-fifth of the patents going to Japanese.
The most recent tally shows that Hitachi Ltd. of Japan heads the top 10 companies obtaining patents in the United States and that only two American companies are on the list - the International Business Machines Corporation and the General Electric Company. The decline of American companies from the list has frequently been cited as evidence of the erosion of the nation's technological prowess.
The sharp increase in the number of patents issued reflects both a rise in the number of applications submitted and a campaign by the patent office to process applications more quickly.
Experts were encouraged by the numbers but were also cautious. ''It's interesting, but it would be nice to see two years in a row,'' said Edwin Mansfield, director of the Center for Economics and Technology at the University of Pennsylvania.

Strategies to Pare Tax Bill for 1989

BYLINE: By Jan M. Rosen

 BODY:
MOST people who take an evening to go over their finances will find they can pare their 1989 tax bills, but they must act in the coming week.
The primary areas of opportunity involve charitable contributions and state and local taxes. For people with self-employment income, a Keogh retirement savings plan offers tax deferment, and for those who can take miscellaneous itemized deductions, there may be ways to increase them.
Of course, for some people it will be advantageous to delay any tax savings until 1990. These include people who may move from 28 percent this year to 33 percent next year, or from 15 percent to 28 percent, and those who are subject to the alternative minimum tax bracket of 21 percent this year but are likely to be subject to a regular 28 percent bracket next year. 
Also, some people remain convinced that Congress will raise tax rates, making deductions worth more in future years.
''My own feeling is that they will not rise,'' said Terence E. Kelly, a tax partner with BDO Seidman in Grand Rapids, Mich. He cited the anticipated ''peace dividend'' from the sweeping change in Eastern Europe, which many expect to lead to a reduction of military outlays; a slowdown in the economy, which would be worsened by a tax increase, and the final phase-out of deductions for personal interest and certain passive losses in 1990, which will result in higher collections.
''However,'' Mr. Kelly said, ''I have some clients who believe rates will rise,'' possibly to 33 percent or 35 percent, and possibly as a trade-off for restoring preferential treatment to long-term capital gains.
For those who want to ease the 1989 tax bite and who itemize deductions, here are the main areas of opportunity:
CHARITABLE GIVING: Gifts of cash, property and securities that are given to eligible charities like churches, synagogues, educational institutions, hospitals and other recognized charities, are deductible.
For those not subject to the alternative minimum tax, it is beneficial to give appreciated securities, rather than cash, because the donor can deduct the fair market value of the securities without having to pay a tax on the capital gain. Substantial gifts of property must be appraised.
The gift must be made in the calendar year 1989, so tax professionals advise clients making large donations to make sure they have evidence that they met the deadline. Send a check by certified mail with a receipt, have the bank certify the check, use a credit card or, to be sure a stock certificate is endorsed in 1989, visit the broker, they advise. If the charity does not receive or record the contribution until 1990, that is all right as long as the donor has evidence of making it before the end of 1989.
STATE AND LOCAL TAXES: Quarterly payments of estimated income taxes are due Jan. 16, Mr. Kelly noted, but those who make them in December can deduct them on their 1989 Federal returns. Similarly, real estate taxes that are paid before the end of the year can be deducted on 1989 returns.
MISCELLANEOUS ITEMIZED DEDUCTIONS: Generally only those expenses that exceed 2 percent of adjusted gross income can be deducted. Still, people who pay large dues to trade unions or professional organizations or who have large business expenses not reimbursed by their employers may qualify for the deduction. If so, they may want to bolster it by paying 1989 bills in December instead of January or entertaining clients and charging it to a credit card this week.
Included in this category are the cost of certain business and professional publications, but multi-year subscriptions cannot be prepaid; tax, investment and financial-planning fees; 80 percent of the cost of certain business meal and entertainment expenses, and rental fees for safe deposit boxes.
KEOGH PLANS: People who have income from self-employment are eligible for these tax-deferred retirement savings accounts. This includes freelance income or income from directors' fees, even for people who also have income from an employer.
Julian Block, a tax lawyer in Larchmont, N.Y., notes that unlike individual retirement accounts, Keogh plans must be established by the end of the year, but they do not have to be financed until the due date of the tax return. He advises those pressed for cash to open an account and contribute more next year.
Turning to another area of tax planning, Mr. Block said relatively affluent individuals often give cash to family members or friends because gifts of up to $10,000 to each recipient ($20,000 from a couple) are not subject to gift taxes.
Grandparents, for example, may help grandchildren with their education expenses. But, Mr. Block warns, here the I.R.S. will not buy the line ''the check is in the mail.'' It has to have cleared the donor's account in 1989 to count this year. So anyone making a gift this week should go to the bank and have the check certified, Mr. Block said.

HEADLINE: Fed Voted for No Change In Policy at Nov. 14 Meeting

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 22

 BODY:
Federal Reserve policy makers decided not to change monetary policy at their late fall meeting but left open the possibility of lower interest rates if economic events dictated, according to minutes of the session released today.
''While current indicators of economic activity suggested a somewhat weaker expansion, most of the members agreed that a steady policy course was desirable at this point, especially in light of the stimulus provided by recent easing actions,'' said the minutes of the Nov. 14 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee.
Most of the policy makers agreed, however, that ''some further easing might be needed if the incoming information on business activity suggested more softening than most members currently expected.'' 
 
First Drop Since Nov. 7
The Fed permitted short-term interest rates to drop a quarter of a percentage point earlier this week, to 8.25 percent. It was the first decrease since Nov. 7, when the central bank also permitted the Federal funds rate to decline a quarter of a percentage point.
Manipulation of this rate, the interest rate that banks charge each other for overnight loans, is the primary lever the Fed uses to control short-term interest rates. It has used this lever several times since last June, when it began relaxing its grip on credit that was aimed at slowing inflation. 10-to-1 Vote by Panel The initial decision to keep the Fed's policy unchanged was reached on a 10-to-1 vote of the market committee, which is made up of Fed governors in Washington and five of the 12 Fed regional bank presidents.
Martha Seger, a Fed governor, cast the dissenting vote, contending that a further easing was needed in view of persisting weakness in the manufacturing sector, particularly automobiles, and a likely softening in construction and capital spending.
The committee met again last Monday and Tuesday, but minutes of that meeting will not be released until next month. The committee gathers in secret eight times a year to formulate monetary policy and confers by telephone as needed.

DATELINE: TOKYO, Dec. 22

 BODY:
The Japanese Government today forecast that the country's economic expansion would slow next year but would still be one of the fastest growing of the major industrial nations. The economy is expected to grow 4 percent in the 1991 fiscal year, which begins next April 1, down from the 4.6 percent estimated for the current year. The projected rate would outpace the estimated growth for the United States and West Germany. Japan has also projected a $78 billion trade surplus for 1990-91, down from an estimated $81 billion this year.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Ends Sharply Lower; Gold Moves Higher in U.S.

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar tumbled yesterday in abbreviated pre-Christmas trading, weighed down by continuing demand for the West German mark and expectations that interest rates are headed lower in the United States.
Gold prices rose in New York after turning in a mixed performance overseas. On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery rose $1.30 an ounce, to $413.20. 
Traders said the dollar was little affected by the continuing United States intervention in Panama and the fall yesterday of Nicolae Ceausescu, the longtime Rumanian leader.
The currency markets finished the trading day at around midday, several hours earlier than normal, as traders got a head start on the three-day holiday weekend.
The underlying factors that have affected the dollar in the last few days - a weakening United States economy and the expectation that interest rates are headed lower - continued to depress the currency, traders said. Falling interest rates hurt the dollar by cutting yields foreigners can get on dollar-denominated investments.
In Europe, dealers said that the dollar was hurt by the strength of the mark. As the dollar fell below the 1.7250-mark level, they said, dealers who had instructions from some customers to sell dollars at that level began executing those orders. In New York, the dollar fell to 1.7070 marks, from 1.7260.
In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.10 Japanese yen to close at 143.67 yen. Later, in London, the dollar was quoted at 143.05 yen. In New York, the dollar fell to 142.35 yen, from 143.65 yen late Thursday.
The dollar also fell against the British pound. In London, the pound rose to $1.6205, from $1.6125 late Thursday. It rose to $1.62425 in New York, from $1.6145 late Thursday.
Selected dollar rates in New York, compared with late rates Thursday, included: 1.5490 Swiss francs, down from 1.5580; 5.8345 French francs, down from 5.8910; 1,277.75 Italian lire, down from 1,285.50, and 1.1592 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1597.

HEADLINE: Boston Mayor's Ulster Project

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: BOSTON, Dec. 22

 BODY:
A nonprofit group founded by the Mayor of Boston and a Northern Ireland political leader will build a $100 million shopping center in the economically depressed city of Londonderry in Northern Ireland.
Ground-breaking will begin next fall on the 300,000-square-foot complex, which is expected to provide about 1,400 jobs in office, service and construction, Mayor Raymond Flynn said Thursday. The shopping center is expected to open in 1992 and will double the retail space in the city, he said.
 
He said it was the largest
American investment ever in Northern Ireland.
The project stems from Boston Ireland Ventures, a nonprofit group founded in 1987 by Mr. Flynn and the Northern Irish political leader John Hume. Mr. Hume is leader of the Social Democratic and Labor Party, representing moderate Roman Catholics.
Londonderry, the second-largest city in Northern Ireland, is one of the poorest areas in the country, with an unemployment rate in some sections at 45 percent.
After 18 months of negotiations with the British Government, which rules Northern Ireland, the O'Connell Development Company, based in Quincy, Mass., agreed to build the complex.

HEADLINE: Opening Way for Aid, Poland Agrees to Economic Change

BYLINE: By MALCOLM W. BROWNE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: McMURDO STATION, Antarctica

 BODY:
A new wind is blowing through America's remote outposts in Antarctica: a not entirely welcome impetus toward healthier bodies and tidier habits.
''I'd say what's happening here is that the damn yuppies are trying to make the ice respectable,'' a veteran Antarctic construction engineer observed. ''It's as silly as whitewashing the rocks around a command post in the middle of a war.''
In the last week swarms of National Science Foundation employees, contractors and Navy men and women were spread over the barren hills of McMurdo Station and environs, picking up cigarette butts, soda cans and other litter, some of it decades old. Neither the renowned English explorer Robert Falcon Scott nor his successors who have used this coastal site since the turn of the century appear to have regarded neatness as the greatest virtue. 
But now, partly because of pressure from Greenpeace and other conservationist groups, the watchword is ''environment''; he or she who willfully dirties Antarctica is made to feel guilty. Foolish as it may seem to longtime Antarctic workers to return garbage and chemicals to the United States, everyone appears to be cooperating. Not to do so is to invite dismissal from one's job and the ice.
 
'It's Time to Change'
A lesser burden of guilt is also heaped upon the slothful.
''Here we have an American base - McMurdo Station - side by side with a New Zealand facility - Scott Base,'' a Navy medical corpsman said. ''The Kiwis eat the same food we do, but at the end of a winter season, our triglycerides and low-density lipoproteins are far higher than theirs. We've tested them.
''The reason,'' he continued, ''is that we spend our time 'vegging out' indoors, while they're out on cross-country skis or jogging. It's time to change our flabby ways.''
McMurdo's four bars, serving a summer population of about 1,200, are still crowded to capacity every night until closing at 11 P.M., but now there are aerobics classes each morning. A full-size bowling alley is in constant use, and a few hardy people jog the gravel road up and down long, steep hills leading to Scott Base, two miles away, even when the temperature dips far below zero.
Bulletin boards around the compound's dormitories and common buildings advertise community projects that include meetings of the local chapter of Alcoholics Anonymous, chili cook-offs, square dances, science lectures and hikes to nearby beauty spots.
 
Reminders of Danger
The homespun tone of some of these activities might make it appear that Antarctica had become as tame as the ordinary world. But there are constant reminders that it is as much a killer as it was when men first set foot here a century ago. In the space of one week this month, two ski-equipped transport planes suffered minor crashes, and a helicopter was briefly stuck near the active crater of Mount Erebus volcano.
No one was hurt in any of these incidents, but many of the buildings and sites in the McMurdo area are named for men killed in a long stream of accidents.
Even officially approved activities can be deadly. One of the more potentially hazardous trips favored by hikers and cross-country skiers is to a landmark called Castle Rock. This stony peak, about eight miles from McMurdo, is reached by ascending a steep, snow-covered glacier, along which trail guides have marked a safe route. From Castle Rock, the view of Ross Island, McMurdo Sound and the shimmering white and blue Royal Society Mountains 70 miles away has captivated every traveler since Captain Scott himself.
 
Follow the Flags
The hiker can avoid trouble on the way to Castle Rock by following the bamboo poles and green flags that mark the trail, provided a sudden blizzard does not obscure the flags and disorient him. But three years ago a group of skiers tried a shortcut, and two of them died at the bottom of a crevasse.
Another of McMurdo Sound's scenic attractions - the labyrinthine ice caves that pock its icebound coast - was placed off limits this year. An unusual warm spell that drove temperatures well above freezing ''rotted'' the ice caves, making them liable to collapse. Antarcticans were deprived of the eerie blue luminescence in the caves caused by sunlight penetrating the ice walls.
 
Small Pleasures
To an outsider, the ban on travel to the ice caves might seem a trivial loss, but the small pleasures afforded by Antarctica's usually hostile environment mean a great deal to residents.
When there is nothing to do outdoors, men and women fall back on the reading and video-cassette libraries. They socialize over long, large meals in the galley; check the Navy-run shop that sells souvenirs, cigarettes and shaving equipment; visit the combination barber and beauty parlor, or sleep.
In the blazing 24-hour-a-day sunlight of midsummer, sleep often comes slowly late at night. Even at 4 A.M. a few insomniacs are usually prowling the dusty streets of ''Mac Town,'' admiring the mountains and savoring the crisp sting of the air.
 
Life in the Dome
Americans should spend more time taking the air, says Dr. John T. Lynch, science director of South Pole Station. Most of the living space at the South Pole, including the dining room, pool room, library, bar and other rooms, are housed in oversize orange meat lockers mounted on stilts under an enormous dome above the two-mile-thick ice sheet. The box-like buildings under the dome have no windows, since their only view would be of the gloomy half-light of the dome's interior.
''It turns people into what we call dome slugs,'' Dr. Lynch said. ''There are South Pole residents who never step outside for days on end. It's unhealthy. People think and work better when they're in direct touch with their environment. I would hope a future South Pole Station would allow its inhabitants more sense of belonging to this harsh place, and not allow them to forget where they are.'' Not everyone shares his views. ''Don't you kid yourself about all this fragile environment stuff,'' said a contractor. ''Antarctica is a monster that'll kill you the first chance it gets. I like working here, but if I couldn't shut out old White Mama a lot of the time, I'd go nuts.''

HEADLINE: China's Lonely Press Tries to Look the Other Way

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIJING, Dec. 22

 BODY:
Fearful of reviving its own domestic opposition, the Chinese leadership has kept much of the extraordinary change in Eastern Europe out of the press.
Diplomatically, China has distanced itself from much of Eastern Europe while drawing closer to Rumania. The popular upheaval that has continued in Rumania, despite the sort of crackdown the Chinese carried out in June, remains unreported in the domestic Chinese press. It was, however, mentioned briefly in the English-language China Daily, intended for foreigners.
Chinese students and intellectuals with access to short-wave radios have been getting news about Eastern Europe from the Voice of America and the British Broadcasting Corporation. The Beijing authorities have jammed both services' Mandarin-language broadcasts with uneven efficiency, but not their English-language transmissions. 
''It seems the dialectic of history is with us,'' said a professor at an elite university here, barely suppressing a smile. ''Of course we are encouraged by the changes in Eastern Europe, especially the students. But anyone old enough to have been through the Cultural Revolution knows that China presents a different set of problems.''
 
Deep Roots
Prime among them, he said, is the deeply rooted nature of the Communist Party here, which made the revolution and constructed the patterns of power. Unlike Communist leaderships in Eastern Europe, the leadership here did not arrive in the baggage train of the Soviet Army. And unlike Communist regimes in the Soviet bloc, the Communist system here was not laid upon a functioning Westernized society like a thin layer of asphalt.
The Communist Parties in China, Vietnam and Cuba - all of which have resisted the political tide that seems to flow, however uncontrolled, from Moscow - are associated with larger historical accomplishments like decolonization, national liberation, literacy and better food distribution.
In China, which remains a peasant-dominated state, the general level of education is far lower than in Eastern Europe. And here, too, there are no independent organizations like the Roman Catholic Church in Poland and the Lutheran Church in East Germany around which an opposition can form.
 
Differences With Moscow
While the policies of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union have been an inspiration to many dissidents in Eastern Europe, China and the Soviet Union haven't seen eye to eye on very much for the last 30 years or so. Even many Chinese opposed to the leadership here still speak with contempt about Soviet society, politics, culture and technology. This is, after all, a country that has dropped the Volga for the Toyota as fast as it could afford to.
Still, the Chinese leadership has taken great pains to try to limit the infectious nature of change in Eastern Europe. In recent weeks, daily coverage of events there has been limited to a few terse reports in the party newspaper, People's Daily. Beijing radio and television have followed suit with limited items at the end of broadcasts.
Even these reports carefully skip over the popular nature of the protests in Eastern Europe. Changes that are mentioned are described as a result of leadership decisions, not public pressure. Chinese news organizations have also tried to emphasize those shifts as designed to ''perfect socialism'' or insure ''stability and unity,'' a common theme in internal Chinese reporting.
 
No Mention of Corruption
In the sparse coverage of East Germany, for instance, there has been no mention of the corruption charges against the former leadership. In the popular protests here in May and June that were finally crushed by the Chinese Army, a central complaint of the demonstrators was the issue of nepotism and corruption among party leaders and their families.
Press organizations here have also quoted some statements by Eastern European leaders criticizing Western ''manipulation'' and ''interference into internal affairs,'' another popular theme here, as the campaign against American ''meddling'' and what the Chinese call the ''capitalist strategy of peaceful evolution against socialist countries'' continues in full swing.
For example, late last month, People's Daily and the official New China News Agency gave prominence to a report in the official Rumanian party paper, Scinteia, of an ''imperialist offensive'' against socialism. They also highlighted a declaration from the Czechoslovak Defense Ministry that said the Czechoslovak Army supported the party and opposed any ''anarchy fanned by the internal and external antisocialist forces.''
 
Focus on 'Turmoil'
There has also been a series of small reports emphasizing ''turmoil'' in Eastern Europe or the potential for it as the result of domestic change. On Wednesday, for example, the press agency issued a four-paragraph item about a warning strike for higher wages by Hungarian train drivers. It quoted Prime Minister Miklos Nemeth as saying that Hungary would collapse if ''all social strata go on strike in this time of widespread domestic difficulties in the economy.''
At the same time, Western diplomats say, the Chinese leadership has been distancing itself from much of Eastern Europe, keeping correct but cool relations, following standard protocol, with the new regimes in Eastern Europe. The exception has been Rumania, which under President Nicolae Ceausescu kept warm relations with Beijing throughout the Chinese-Soviet split. Ties have become even closer, as they have with North Korea and Cuba.
 
Visit to Rumania
In late November, Qiao Shi, a member of the standing committee of the Chinese Politburo, visited Rumania. In a meeting with Mr. Ceausescu on Nov. 21, reported by the press agency, Mr. Qiao said he was ''deeply impressed by the powerful leadership of the party'' and the ''political ideological work prevalent in the whole party and people.''
On Nov. 18, People's Daily published a lengthy interview with Mr. Ceausescu, who said he ''treasures'' his ties with China and that in a ''rather complicated'' world situation, ''it is all the more necessary to increase cooperation between Communist parties and socialist countries.''
A message from the Chinese to mark the end of the recent Rumanian party congress called for ''militant unity'' between the two parties on the basis of ''revolutionary friendship.''
In the weekly Foreign Ministry briefing on Thursday, the ministry spokesman, Jin Guihua, was asked if China would support Rumania's move to crush ''counterrevolutionary'' demonstrations as the Rumanians had supported China in June. But the spokesman was clearly not going to be drawn into such parallels. He simply said that China did not approve of any country interfering in the internal affairs of another - the same phrase China used today to condemn American military action in Panama - and said, ''We believe that Rumania can properly deal with its own affairs.''
 
A Party Meeting
A Chinese party member said a high-level party meeting was held last week to discuss Eastern Europe, in an effort to enable party organizers to brief their units. The party member said the changes in Eastern Europe were attributed to three factors: the influence of Mr. Gorbachev, who was said to have been described in unflattering terms; the presence in Eastern Europe of ''uneradicated bourgeois and social democratic elements,'' and ''the interference in internal affairs'' by capitalist countries, in particular the United States.
China, the party member said, was described as being a bastion of Communism in the world and one of its firmest defenders. With developments in Rumania, China's position seems that much lonelier today.
On Wednesday, the Chinese party General Secretary, Jiang Zemin, spoke at a conference for party officials. In his speech, reported by the official press agency, he said that stability and economic progress were China's main tasks and required adherence to its policy of openness to the outside world.
 
Hopes for Continued Friendship
BEIJING, Dec. 23 (Reuters) -China's Foreign Ministry said today that it hopes to remain friends with Rumania and, in a report from Bucharest, the official New China News Agency adopted a tone that was mildly supportive of Nicolae Ceausescu without endorsing him personally.
The ministry comment was the first official reaction to developments in Rumania since Mr. Ceausescu fled Bucharest on Friday and army units sided with pro-democracy demonstrators to fight die-hard loyalists.

New Candor in the Coverage in Rumania and East Germany

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 23

 BODY:
The Rumanian press has begun reporting events with a candor unthinkable before the ouster of Nicolae Ceausescu, Following are excerpts from the Rumanian press agency Agerpres and Rumanian, East German and Hungarian broadcasts as monitored and translated by the United States Government's Foreign Broadcast Information Service.
 
A National Front
 
Rumanian radio domestic service - Ion Iliescu, in a live studio appearance, begins to read a communique from the Council of National Salvation. Iliescu says that the overthrow of the Ceausescu regime is the result of the heroic struggle of all the people, of all nationalities, particularly the youth, and will open a new page in Rumania's political and economic history. He says it was decided to set up a National Salvation Front, supporting the army, to restore democracy and freedom. The Government and the State Council have been dismissed. All state power has been assumed by the National Salvation Front, to which the army will subordinate itself. Local councils of the National Salvation Front, he says, are to be set up in all counties to insure public transportation, public supplies, and a normal development of activities. 
Iliescu says it is proposed:
* To abandon the leading role of a single party and adopt a pluralist system.
* To separate various state powers.
* That the country be called Rumania in the future.
* To form a committee to draft a new constitution.
* To restructure agriculture, helping smallholders, eliminating ideological dogmas.
* To observe the rights of national minorities.
* To reorganize all trade activity.
* To direct the entire foreign policy to united Europe.
* To observe commitments with the Warsaw Pact.
* To observe human rights.
* To restore civilian rule.
Iliescu says the new Salvation Council is a provisional structure.
This is the mandate he received, Iliescu concludes. The reading of the communique concludes. The national anthem is sung.
 
An Appeal to Builders
 
Rumanian Radio domestic service - We appeal to builders on work sites, the nearest one is on Stirbei Voda Street. Builders on Stirbei Voda Street, in the areas close to the radio-television station, come with your heavy equipment with which you build blocks of apartments, erect apartments and beautiful houses for us. Come now and defend the radio television station. We would also like to call on all physicians and all public health care units, and to all physicians in Rumania. In order to preserve health, all physicians should come to their offices.
At last moment, piece of news which fills our hearts with joy and we hope it will make you happy, too, esteemed listeners: The tanks of the Ministry of National Defense have arrived to defend the building of the radio station in Nufebilor Street 22-64. The Rumanian Army is up to expectations as it has been during these days of difficult trial for the Rumanian nation.
 
A New Broadcast
 
Rumanian Radio domestic service - Esteemed listeners, for all of you we have an important piece of news transmitted a few moments ago, namely that Timisoara radio station has resumed transmitting.
At this moment we have received wondrous proof from our colleagues in Timisoara; here is radio free Timisoara.
We are broadcasting after 5 years of silence from the hero city, free Timisoara.
The tyranny has fallen. This is the title of a leaflet which was brought to us from the street to our editorial office.
Empowered by the action committee of the Rumanian Democratic Front, we now will read the following proclamation:
The Rumanian Democratic Front is a political mass organization set up in Timisoara to achieve a dialogue with the Rumanian Government with a view to democratizing our country. The Rumanian Democratic Front conditions the beginning of this dialogue on the resignation of the tyrant, Nicolae Ceausescu. As a basis of discussion, we propose the following demands to the Rumanian Government:
All those arrested during the (inaudible) rose up against tyranny and to the collective of the National Theater for their support. The Rumanian people have won. We have in our hands the first leaflet published in Timisoura today entitled: The Tyranny Has Fallen.
 
Mending Fences
 
The Hungarian press agency, MTI - The Hungarian Ministry of Defense has made public the text of the telephone call which Minister of Defense Ferend Rarpati placed on Friday to Lieut. Gen. Nicolae Eftimescu, first deputy of the chief of staff of the Rumanian Army. . . .
Rarpati: I greet you and would like you to give us information on the situation there, and about what we can do to help, in the form of medicine, bandages, food or anything else that you need.
Eftimescu: My greetings to Comrade Rarpati. . . . You could become convinced that we have no mind of negative intentions against you, as was the situation in the past. The friendship between the two armies is stronger than was the friendship between the leaders. And this entitles me to state that the army is, and shall be capable of, fulfilling its tasks in this situation. Rarpati: We heard that something had happened to Comrade Milea. Eftimescu: Milea was assassinated. He was killed because he refused to obey the order to use the army against the people. Rarpati: Who is leading the army? Eftimescu: The Ministry of National Defense will be able to carry out the tasks also in the future. We have already issued the order for the Army to not fire against the people. If you wish to help, appeal to the Hungarian people to refrain from provocative stands on their part. The new leadership will be named shortly. The People's Unity Front Committee is closely cooperating with the Army, and the new leadership will probably be named in the late afternoon hours.

HEADLINE: Upheaval in the East: The Experts' View;
Outlook Is Uncertain for Rumanian Democracy and Economic Improvement

BYLINE: By ERIC PACE

 BODY:
Experts on Rumania and international relations agree that the army will continue to play a crucial role as popular unrest propels the country toward change, but they give differing appraisals of the prospects for democracy and improvement in the economy.
Reacting to the uprising against President Nicolae Ceausescu, Ken Jowitt, a professor of political science at the University of California at Berkeley, said on Friday, ''The army obviously will play a critical role in eliminating whatever opposition from Ceausescu forces may exist and will undoubtedly provide part of the new leadership.''
Professor Jowitt said a post-Ceausescu Government would provide the nation with an entirely fresh start.
 
'Clean Sweep' for Rumania
''Assuming civil war does not break out, I believe that there will be clean sweep, both politically and economically, for at least two reasons,'' he said. ''The first is the widespread rage against the Communist Party of Rumania that permeates the entire population. The second is the example of what is happening'' elsewhere in Eastern Europe. 
He also said Rumanians in the near future will more likely follow ''the more radical Hungarian, rather than the more limited Bulgarian, reform process.''
Professor Jowitt, whose scholarly concerns include all Communist governments, is the author of the 1971 book ''Revolutionary Breakthroughs and National Development in Rumania'' and the editor of the 1978 book ''Social Change in Rumania 1860-1940.'' He speaks Rumanian and has visited Rumania repeatedly over the years.
''What we have to look for now is Rumania's ability to take advantage of the fact that it has no foreign debt, unlike other reforming East European regimes,'' Professor Jowitt said. ''And it also possesses what is potentially a very rich agriculture.''
 
'Really a Disaster'
But Norman Manea, a Rumanian dissident writer who is an International Fellow at Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, said, ''Rumania now needs much wealth from the Western countries, because the situation there is really a disaster,'' as far as the economy is concerned.
He said Rumanians ''need the basic elementary needs of sustenance.''
Throughout the 1980's, President Ceausescu pursued a harsh austerity program to eliminate the country's foreign debt, which once stood at $11 billion. The measures included widespread cutbacks in electrical power and heating for homes and industries and a basic disregard for consumer needs.
Joseph Rothschild, a professor of Political Science at Columbia University and a specialist in East Central Europe, took a gloomy view of the prospects for democracy in Rumania, which with 23 million people is the third most populous country in the Soviet bloc after the Soviet Union and Poland.
''I don't expect much,'' he said Friday. ''This is not a country with a democratic tradition which the Communists had suppressed. It is a country that has never had a democratic tradition.''
 
'Potentially Fairly Rich Country'
Appraising the economy, he said: ''Rumania is a potentially fairly rich country. There is a lot of resources under the ground and a significantly trained and economically hardworking and indeed even talented population, so I think the economy can probably do far better than it's done in the last decade'' under the Ceausescu regime.
The post-Ceausescu leadership, he predicted, ''won't be so obsessed by Ceausescu's concern to pay off all foreign debts.''
He predicted that a new government would ''pursue a quite nationalistic line vis-a-vis the Soviets'' and that Rumania would now try to reclaim - or at least to call for the return - of Moldavia, which is now part of the Soviet Union but was formerly a province of Rumania.
J. Michael Montias, an expert on Eastern European economics at Yale University who visited Rumania earlier this month, said: ''The Rumanians are a very talented people. Their elites, while they have been very subservient to the regime, have within them a real potential for improving the Rumanian economy and moving to a more humane political system.''
 
Not a 'Backward Balkan Nation'
Rumania should not be treated ''just as a backward Balkan nation,'' he said.
''They have a history that suggests that democracy is not to be ruled out at all as a possible path of political development,'' he said. ''So I'm not at all unhopeful that if - as the Russians would say - the constellation of forces is right, that Rumania could move toward democracy and toward something like a market economy.''
But Sam Beck, an anthropologist at Cornell who has done research inside Rumania, said that ''for the country to re-establish itself economically, the workers are going to have to have confidence in whatever new government emerges'' if the country's productive capacity is to be expanded.
''What it means is that the Rumanian people as a whole are once again being put into the position of having to sacrifice for the good of the state,'' he said. Mr. Beck added that economic stabilization would be particularly difficult given the current upheaval and the hardships of winter.
But Mr. Beck did see some optimistic signs. ''It's significant that the army did apparently join the populace as a whole and in at least some instances refused to follow the instructions of the security apparatus,'' he said. ''It renews one's confidence in the ability of oppressed people to resist even the kinds of disciplinary mechanisms that can be employed by the military arm of the state apparatus.''
 
'Threshold of Tolerance'
In Washington, former Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig said the ''student-led uprising has now apparently garnered the support of the military so that in the near term, in the final analysis, the military will be instrumental in the future government.''
He also observed that the army's ''threshold of tolerance was exceeded by the brutality of the events in recent days, and that provides a basis for optimism about the future.''
As to the prospects for a post-Ceausescu civilian leadership in Rumania, Mr. Haig, a former supreme Allied commander in Europe, said, ''It's classic in such situations that party moderates will be probably in the first wave of government authority.''
In the economic realm, he said, the only way the country can go now is up. ''Rumania has historically been capable of exports to the West and to the United States,'' he said, ''and therefore, after a period of transition, and given the dire straits of the ecnomy today, it can do nothing but improve.''
Mr. Haig, who was Secretary of State under President Reagan, is the president of Worldwide Associates, an international marketing, merchant-banking and real estate company, and is writing a book on the history of the Cold War.

HEADLINE: Upheaval in the East: Emigres;
From Abroad, Uncertainty And Grieving

BYLINE: By DONATELLA LORCH

 BODY:
Mujur Stancu held a candle and wept yesterday as he sang and prayed in St. Dimitru's Church for the thousands of his countrymen who have been killed in Rumania this week.
About 100 Rumanian-Americans crammed into the one-room Rumanian Orthodox church, smoky with incense, on Manhattan's Upper West Side. Most of them had come to exchange news from Romania - death and perhaps, fledgling democracy - and to discuss what they could do to help relatives and friends there.
Before the Rev. Dimitru Sasu began his simple memorial prayer, the atmosphere was feverish as men and women gathered under the gilded wood paintings of saints and martyrs to speak of revolution, relatives and the fate of President Nicolae Ceausescu. 
''I haven't slept in two days,'' said Mr. Stancu, who is worried about his mother and sister in Bucharest. ''No one knows what is going on. It takes three to four hours to get a phone line to Romania.'' #50,000 Rumanians in U.S.
About 50,000 Rumanians live in the United States, the vast majority having immigrated after World War II, said Vasile Ciobanu, the president of Rumania 21, an organization for exiles. He estimated that 30,000 live in the New York area.
They are loosely organized, with most of them maintaining only individual ties with their homeland. The events this week in Romania, however, are drawing these emigres together and forging a new sense of solidarity.
Mr. Ciobanu was urging Rumanians at the church to return to their homeland and fight. The only consensus at the church, however, was to see Mr. Ceaucescu's dictatorship replaced by democracy, free elections and a market economy.
News of the capture of Mr. Ceausescu, who ruled Rumania for more than a quarter of a century before he was ousted Friday, was greeted with hugs and tears of joy.
 
Anxiety About Violence
But many were anxious about the mounting death toll. Fierce fighting between the army and pro-Ceaucescu security police has claimed hundreds of lives nationwide in the last two days.
Some of the people at St. Dimitru's were dressed in mink coats, others in tattered leather jackets and jeans. But all who gathered in the church seemed to agree that Mr Ceaucescu was a criminal and should be tried for murder.
Their main concern, however, was helping their countrymen. Some of the young men said they wanted to return to fight, and one said he wished the United States would dispatch troops, as it did this week to Panama.
Father Sasu has established a Rumanian Aid Fund to collect money and to send blood supplies, clothes and food.
''I called Bucharest at 3 A.M.,'' Father Sasu said. ''People are saying that it is worse than World War II.''
 
Supplies Are Running Low
The priest said that his niece, a doctor in Timisoara, had been bathing patients with her hands and water because soap and other supplies were unavailable.
He said it was taking about three hours to get a phone line to Rumania, so he had received only sporadic news. But Father Sasu said he had received phone calls from doctors throughout the United States who wanted to go to Rumania to assist in the medical emergency.
Donna Manea, who lives in Jackson Heights in Queens, said her mother had been fired upon in the streets of Bucharest.
But Mrs. Manea was exultant when she spoke of the new provisional Government formed in Bucharest.
''I have a such a feeling of elation,'' said Mrs. Manea, 40 years old, who arrived in New York a year ago. ''Yesterday my mother could speak freely on the phone for the first time. Sometimes, I feel guilty that I am here.''
 
Need for Blood Donations
Father Sasu told the congregation that he had heard reports that the blood bank in Bucharest had been destroyed by ''terrorists,'' and he asked for donations so that fresh supplies could be sent.
Almost all of the people who gathered at the church had heard that the water supply in Timisoara had been contaminated, and that residents had been advised to be careful in choosing what they drank.
Hogea Vladian, 37 years old, an artist from New Jersey, said he was skeptical about the Rumanian-American community's ability to organize.
''Everyone has different ways of arranging things, and that's exactly what is going on in Bucharest,'' he said.
He said that he would like to return to his country, but that he was frustrated by the lack of organization. ''It's anarchy over there, he said.''

HEADLINE: New Bush Budget Will Stick To Themes From Campaign

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 23

 BODY:
Sticking to the themes he developed in his election campaign last year, President Bush will emphasize in his budget message to Congress next month new proposals to encourage personal saving and modest spending increases for drug control, education, science, research and the environment, Administration officials said.
And in keeping with his campaign pledges, Mr. Bush will propose no broad additional taxes. But he plans to call for raising a small amount of money with new taxes that he calls ''user fees,''
He also plans to modify slightly his proposal that was blocked by Congress this year to cut the capital gains tax rate and to recommend a new long-term, tax-free savings account.
The President will assert that the lower capital gains tax and the new savings account are essential aspects of the Government's strategy to increase personal savings that can be used for long-term investment. 
 
Budget Message on Jan. 22
Mr. Bush is still tying up loose ends of the budget, which he is to submit to Congress on Jan. 22, and some Cabinet members and agency heads say they still do not know how much they will have to spend in the fiscal year 1991, which begins next Oct. 1. The basic themes of the Bush proposals were gleaned from interviews with White House officials as well as others.
Mr. Bush will stress, they said, that the $6 billion to $8 billion in cuts that he plans to propose for the military need to be used entirely for deficit reduction, not for new domestic spending. He will call for a spending freeze in most domestic programs and will propose no expensive initiatives.
Overall, the budget is expected to call for spending only slightly more than the $1.1 trillion in the current budget, and to project a deficit just below the $64 billion limit set by the budget-balancing law. The Administration estimates that without any cuts in spending or increases in revenue, the deficit for the fiscal year 1991 would be $105 billion.
The Administration's budget will provide a framework for Congress, but from recent experience the specific elements of the final budget Congress approves will bear only the vaguest resemblance to those the President submits.
Here, based on interviews with many officials, are the budget proposals in various areas:
MILITARY. Mr. Bush is expected to ask Congress to approve $295 billion in budget authority for the Pentagon and to propose actual spending of $292 billion. Budget authority is the amount of money Congress approves in a particular year; at the Pentagon the money is often spent over several years.
Those figures are slightly above the $291.2 billion in budget authority and $288.4 in spending in this year's budget. But they are 2 percent to 3 percent below the amount needed to keep pace with inflation and thus, in the odd way budgets are calculated, are counted as a cut of $6 billion to $8 billion.
HEALTH. The President will propose limiting health spending to $5.5 billion below what would be necessary to keep up with inflation, the largest budget reduction outside the military. Hospital reimbursement rates and payments to some physicians under Medicare would be lowered, and Federal money for medical education and capital improvements for urban hospitals would be reduced.
Spending for alcohol and drug abuse would increase slightly, to $2.5 billion, but financing of AIDS research would not be increased. The Food and Drug Administration would be allowed to spend slightly more than this year.
TAXES. To gain more political support for his capital gains proposal, Mr. Bush plans to recommend lowering the tax rate not only for profits from the sale of securities but also those from the sale of real estate, timber and most other assets. His capital gains proposal this year was limited to securities like stocks and bonds. Capital gains are now taxed at the same rate as other income, 28 percent for the wealthiest taxpayers but as high as 33 percent for others. Mr. Bush would reduce the rate to below 20 percent.
The new savings plan would let couples make contributions of about $5,000 a year to a special account, and interest and dividends would be exempt from taxation if the deposits were left in the account for at least 10 years.
The budget will also propose raising $2.5 billion in additional taxes by requiring all state and local government employees to pay the Medicare payroll tax now required of all other workers. Some of those workers are now exempt from the health insurance tax.
Mr. Bush will ask Congress to approve several small new taxes - user fees. For example, he will suggest a sales tax on pleasure boats, recreational vehicles and some camping equipment, with the money to be used for various environmental and recreational programs. Additional fees will also be proposed for processing certain Government forms. Congress has rejected several user fees that former President Ronald Reagan, as well as Mr. Bush, proposed over the last several years.
ENVIRONMENT. In the 1988 campaign Mr. Bush pledged to be the environment President, and his budget message will highlight the environment, showing, for the first time, a tally of all Federal environmental programs. The budget will include a substantial increase in the operating budget of the Environmental Protection Agency, which is about $2 billion this year. Much of the additional money will be earmarked for research on toxic substances, global warming, acid rain and pollution control. More money will also be allotted for enforcement programs.The budget will also include more money for cleaning up pollution at nuclear weapons plants and for acquiring, operating and maintaining national parks.
EDUCATION. As a candidate, Mr. Bush also pledged strong support for education. This year he proposed small amounts of money to reward successful schools, recognize superior teachers and otherwise improve education. These proposals were rejected by Congress, which preferred to place the limited resources on compensatory education programs for poor children.
The President is expected to resubmit the proposals that failed this year and to recommend additional support for health and nutrition for preschool children as well as an expansion of the preschool program Head Start.
DRUG CONTROL. He will call for more money for prison construction, law enforcement and intelligence operations related to the use and trafficking of illegal drugs. He wants a larger allocation for the Border Patrol and more military and economic assistance to Colombia, Peru and Bolivia, the sources of much of the cocaine in the United States.
SCIENCE AND RESEARCH. Mr. Bush will stress applied research to improve the competitive position of American industry internationally. He will call for an increase in the budget of the National Science Foundation, and will seek additional money for developing hardware for a space station, to be completed late in the 1990's.
BUDGET PROCEDURES. Mr.. Bush will suggest that the budget-balancing law be modified so that spending added after the start of a fiscal year would make it more difficult to reach the law's deficit target in the next year. And he will ask for increased authority to block spending approved by Congress that he does not favor.

HEADLINE: AIDS Strategy for Addicts Is Faulted

BYLINE: By GINA KOLATA

 BODY:
Scores of programs that provide clean needles or bleach to drug addicts to prevent transmission of the AIDS virus may fail because they overlook other routes of infection, according to new research and the observations of other experts.
The findings are causing a rethinking of a critical AIDS prevention strategy among the group in which the AIDS virus is spreading most rapidly. Already half of the intravenous drug users in New York are thought to be infected, and many are so frightened of getting AIDS that they are accepting bleach kits to disinfect their needles and syringes.
But the researchers report that even the addicts who try to protect themselves by using bleach risk infection by sharing the water supply they use for rinsing their syringes, and then using that same water to liquefy their drugs for injection.
The addicts also share other paraphernalia that could be contaminated with the virus. But some experts say that even though they are now recognizing the importance of giving the addicts more than bleach, it is politically difficult to give out drug paraphernalia. 
 
Only Half the Message
''It certainly becomes more controversial to give out things that are used in the act of injection,'' said Dr. Don Des Jarlais, director of research at Beth Israel Medical Center's chemical dependency institute in New York.
The Federal Centers for Disease Control reports that of the 113,211 Americans diagnosed as having AIDS, 23,722 used intravenous drugs. An estimated 100,000 intravenous drug users in New York City have the AIDS virus, according to a report by the National AIDS Commission. It can take a decade before an infected person develops AIDS.
Most AIDS education programs, some experts say, are giving addicts only half the message they need to protect themselves against the virus. In most of more than 100 local programs in American cities, addicts are advised to avoid infection with the AIDS virus by using condoms in sex and bleaching needles and syringes.
These programs usually send workers out to take bleach and condoms directly to addicts. A handful of such programs, including one in New York City, also distribute clean needles and syringes.
''We've focused all of our efforts on needles and syringes,'' said Dr. Stephen Koester, an ethnographer with the University of Colorado's Addiction Research and Treatment Services. ''It was not until we really watched people shoot drugs that we came to realize that there is more high-risk behavior than simply sharing needles and syringes.''
 
Peril of Sharing the Water
Dr. Koester said he became aware of the risks that addicts take when he visited their hangouts in Denver and watched what intravenous drug use actually involves. He found, he said, that water is scarce in ''shooting galleries,'' which are often in abandoned buildings.
Seventy-five percent of the 104 addicts he questioned said they shared water, usually rinsing their syringes in it after they injected themselves and before they cleaned the needle and syringe with bleach. Another addict would then use some of that water to liquify heroin, cocaine or other drug before injecting it.
''We have walked into shooting galleries and seen water that was actually pink with addicts' blood,'' Dr. Koester said.
He taped an interview with a heroin user who said: ''Some people shoot dope quicker and faster than others. So, while somebody is rinsing their syringe out in a cup of water, another person is pulling water out to put into their spoon to cook their dope in.''
 
An Economic Necessity
Dr. Koester also found that 85 percent of the addicts in his study shared a spoon or bottle-cap ''cooker'' to mix cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine or other intravenous drugs. It is a ritual meant to conserve the precious drugs. ''Sharing as camaraderie is a myth,'' Dr. Koester said. ''It's an economic necessity.''
First, a group of users will pool their powdered drug and mix it together. Then they will put a cotton filter in the cap to screen undissolved particles that could clog the needle. They siphon up all of the solution into a single syringe and measure how much each user can have.
Then they squirt the solution back out into the spoon and each person puts his or her needle in the cotton and draws up a share of the drug solution. Frequently, to get the last drops of drug out, a user will wait until everyone has drawn off some, and then that user will add a little water to the filter, swish it around and inject the water.
Dr. Des Jarlais also found that the vast majority of New York addicts share cookers. And he has found that addicts who shared cookers were more likely to have AIDS virus infections than were addicts who did not share cookers but otherwise behaved similarly to the sharers.
 
The Ones Who Didn't Know
Intravenous drug users sometimes bleed profusely trying to find a vein. ''They take a rag and wipe the blood up,'' said Yolanda Serrano, executive director of Adapt, the Association for Drug Abuse Prevention and Treatment in New York.
Dr. Koester said that when he told addicts that by sharing water, spoons and filters they risked getting the virus even if they cleaned their needles and syringes with bleach, most were shocked. ''People in the streets say, 'Oh my God, I didn't know you could get it this way,' '' he said.
The majority of addicts who have been questioned said they thought bleach or a clean needle and syringe were enough.
Dr. Barry S. Brown, chief of the community research branch at the National Institute on Drug Abuse in Rockville, Md., conceded that he had thought it would be enough to give out clean needles and that addicts would know how to protect themselves. ''I was really surprised,'' he said. He added that he recently instructed the institute's 41 programs in 45 cities to at least distribute clean water with the bleach and to tell addicts not to share drug paraphernalia.
Dr. Brown said he thought addicts would know they were taking risks by sharing water and paraphernalia. ''You would think there would have been some generalization,'' he said, ''but unfortunately there hasn't been.''
Dr. T. Stephen Jones, a medical epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, keeps track of the agency's efforts to prevent AIDS virus infections among addicts. He said that although the centers have not asked that addicts be given anything beyond bleach and condoms more aggressive efforts are ''something we're considering.''
 
A Clash of Terminologies
Dr. Jones said in particular that although he had ''never heard of anyone giving out water,'' such a program ''would be a good idea.'' The centers finance prevention efforts in 27 metropolitan areas.
Dr. Reyes Ramos, an ethnographer with the University of Illinois in Chicago who works with addicts in El Paso said: ''A lot of the literature talks about high-risk behavior and needle sharing as if addicts have the same terminology as the researchers. By being out there, I've learned that isn't the case.''
Virologists say they have not established just how infectious bloody water, used cotton drug filters, or shared spoons or bottle caps might be if one of a group of addicts was infected with the AIDS virus. Dr. Charles Schable, chief of the serology section at the Centers for Disease Control, said, ''Any time you are transferring body fluids, that would be a potential concern.''
Dr. Koester said his group is now handing out not just bleach but also bottles of water and a piece of cotton to use as a filter when they counsel addicts.
 
Trying to Reach the Addict
Dr. Reyes has recently started handing out water along with bleach and instructing addicts on the dangers of sharing. ''We haven't gotten to the point where we can say that we have organized them to protect themselves, but we are working toward it,'' he said.
Ms. Serrano goes one step further. ''We give them everything,'' she said. ''We give them a one-ounce bottle of bleach. We give them a one-ounce bottle of water. We give them cotton. We give them a cooker. We give them an alcohol swab, and we give them bandages.''
She said many of the addicts her group has counseled have said they are changing their ways. But, she said, with just 13 workers, Adapt has been able to reach relatively few of New York's drug users. ''Bleach is not enough,'' she said. ''Only a small group know that. Most still need to be reached.''

CORRECTION-DATE: December 28, 1989, Thursday, Late Edition - Final

 CORRECTION:
An article on Sunday about programs to prevent transmission of the AIDS virus by drug addicts referred incorrectly to one at the community research branch of the National Institute on Drug Abuse. It provides bleach to clean needles, but does not give out needles.

HEADLINE: Cold Wave Testing Natural Gas System

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, Dec. 23

 BODY:
With bitter arctic cold sweeping across much of the nation, dozens of utilities and large industrial customers are scrambling to secure enough energy to avoid shortages and plant shutdowns.
The cold wave is the first major test of the ability of the pipeline system to meet the heaviest demand for natural gas since the Reagan Administration deregulated prices five years ago.
''Right now it is doing well,'' said Michael German, senior vice president of the American Gas Association, an industry trade group. ''The issue is how long the system can maintain record deliverabilities.'' 
 
Operating at Capacity
Natural gas pipelines have been operating at full capacity for more than a week, and dozens of steel mills and automobile and chemical plants in many parts of the Midwest and Northeast have been forced to switch to fuel oil, propane and other power sources.
Analysts said these and other industrial users represented about a third of all gas-shipment orders. Because they can burn other fuels, their supply contracts allow the pipeline companies to shut off supplies to them when cold waves cause a surge in demand. These interruptible contracts have lower rates.
''There has been no curtailment of firm customers by major pipelines, and we don't expect it for the holidays,'' said R. Skip Horvath, an official of the Interstate Gas Association of America, a trade group in Washington representing large pipeline companies. He was referring to customers, including millions of homeowners, who rely solely on natural gas for heating.
The National Weather Service says this month could be the coldest December of the century; the average temperature nationwide was 18 percent below normal through Dec. 16.
 
Busy Month for Pipelines
Pipeline companies say gas shipments, running 30 percent above normal levels, could set a monthly record. The American Gas Association said the highest monthly volume was 2.4 trillion cubic feet in January 1979. Mr. German estimated that shipments this month would range from 2.3 trillion to 2.5 trillion cubic feet.
Industry analysts and pipeline executives said the record cold wave would probably put an end to the surplus of natural gas that gave consumers an upper hand and kept prices depressed over the last four years. It could also stimulate pipeline construction even beyond the $10 billion worth now on the drawing boards, the analysts said.
Prices have soared as natural gas inventories, at a record high in mid-November, slipped below their normal early-winter level.
Sub-zero temperatures are forecast for northern Texas and Oklahoma this weekend.. That would freeze water vapor in hundreds of wells, temporarily cutting gas production.
 
Shortages: Real and Feared
Energy analysts say that if bitterly cold weather again moves south to the Gulf of Mexico for periods of a week or more in coming months, shortages and serious power curtailments for much of the nation may be unavoidable. Scattered shortages of propane and home heating oil were reported last week, especially in the Northeast.
''Even if we have normal weather in January, February and March, we're going to be on the ropes because of the storage runoffs that are occuring now,'' said John E. Olson, a natural-gas analyst with the First Boston Corporation in Houston.
In recent days a number of utilities, industrial users and other large gas consumers have signed or entered negotiations for long-term supply contracts. Many of them were influenced by reports that public gas utilities were offering more than $3 per thousand cubic feet in the spot market, and finding few takers, to keep up with soaring demand. A month ago prices were in the $1.70 range.
The spot market, which deals in natural gas for shipment in 30 days or less, has grown to account for about 75 percent of orders taken by pipeline companies since price controls ended.
 
Placing Their Orders
Sharply depleted gas inventories will keep prices from plunging in the spring when pipeline companies place orders with producers to rebuild their stocks. Prices paid to producers in recent years have ranged from $1.30 per thousand cubic feet in slack periods of spring and fall to about $2 in January, typically the month of peak demand.
A shift to longer contracts and higher prices, if it is sustained, should give producers incentive to raise their drilling budgets, industry officials said.
''This winter of 1989-90 is going to be a watershed'' for the industry, said Thomas A. Petrie, managing director of Petrie, Parkman & Company, an energy investment firm in Denver.
Rising natural gas consumption in recent years had already caused many large independent gas producers, including Burlington Resources, Enron Oil and Gas, Anadarko Petroleum and Union Texas Petroleum, to increase their drilling budgets for 1990.
With economic factors pointing toward rising prices, ''the incentive to drill is increasing,'' said David N. Fleischer, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
Theodore R. Eck, Amoco Inc.'s chief economist, said drilling activity would rise sharply if gas prices averaged near $2.50 per thousand cubic foot in the coming years.
 
A Cleaner Fuel
For the first eight months of this year natural gas consumption was up 14 percent over the comparable period of 1986, according to the Energy Information Administration. Growth is expected to outpace other fuels, in part because natural gas is one of the least-polluting fossil fuels.
Many analysts said 30-day contracts now being negotiated would range from $2.40 to $2.60 per thousand cubic feet in January, compared with an average of about $1.70 in November and $1.90 in December. With the squeeze on inventories, natural gas prices should move into a higher trading range in 1990.
''Prices won't be as important'' to pipeline executives in the weeks ahead as they search for new gas supplies this winter, said Charles M. Oglesby, executive vice president of the Coastal Natural Gas Group, operator of the nation's fourth largest pipeline system.
He said pipelines near the Gulf Coast would not wait until spring to rebuild their storage reserves if temperatures moderate and prices ease in the coming weeks.

HEADLINE: THE YEAR'S BEST;
MORE/On Art

BYLINE: By Michael Brenson

 BODY:
The texture of a season is defined as much by the atmosphere around main events as by the events themselves, as much by the huge and ever-changing cast as by current art stars. Here are a few snapshots from a very personal album.
When you arrive at a large international group exhibition of contemporary art a few days before the opening, there is invariably chaos. You assume that somehow the art will be installed on time, and it usually is. But if you had arrived in Brazil a few days before the opening of the recent SAO PAULO BIENAL and seen all the empty galleries and unloaded crates, you probably would have said to yourself, ''Not this time.'' But the art did get installed and the exhibition did open on schedule. And if some work was uncrated and the varnish on the benches was wet, there was still a sense of triumph. There always is. The first time I saw ''BRAQUE AND PICASSO: PIONEERING CUBISM'' at the Museum of Modern Art was the weekend before the opening when there was no one in the galleries and there were no labels on the walls and the only sound was the stopping and starting of the motorized chair of William Rubin, who, like other curators, depends upon a wheelchair to soften the ordeal of a formidable installation. That day I could not speak about what I had seen. For the first time an exhibition had left me mute. There is one ''Braque and Picasso'' exhibition that depends upon contemplation, but there is also another that depends upon crowds. Between them is a gap that is almost impossible to chart. Anyone visiting the VELAZQUEZ show at the Metropolitan Museum of Art is likely to be struck not only by the paintings but also by the number of viewers standing in the center of the galleries looking confused or lost. What they expect is clearly not what they find. Perhaps the promise of something called ''great art'' is such that the art cannot possibly deliver. Perhaps promising a blockbuster and delivering a small, coherent, scholarly exhibition will generate a frustration that no museum wants.
Here are some New York highlights outside the spotlight. BETYE SAAR'S ''MOJOTECH,'' at the Studio Museum in Harlem, a pointed and poetic meditation on tribal and technological magic . . . With its economy and eloquence, HOUSTON CONWILL'S ''POETS RISE,'' at the new Social Security headquarters in South Jamaica, Queens, may be the best public sculpture installed in New York City this year . . . Of the myriad works inspired by love and knowledge of nature, few have been more surprising and moving than the sculptures of GIUSEPPE PENONE at the Marian Goodman Gallery (through Dec. 30) . . . JONATHAN SILVER's installation of syncretic, allegorical figures at the Sculpture Center put off some people but touched others in ways that not much contemporary art can . . . ''MASTERPIECES OF MING AND QING PAINTING FROM THE FORBIDDEN CITY,'' at the Metropolitan Museum, demonstrated that Chinese painting is so fundamental that eventually just about everyone is going to have to think about it who cares deeply about art. In any album, there are snapshots of people: Barbara Kruger, walking through the galleries of the Pompidou Center in Paris prior to the opening of the ''Magiciens de la Terre,'' weary from installing her own work but with an eagerness and curiosity that should have been the spirit of that failed show . . . Janice Biala, the feisty and articulate octagenarian painter in Paris who bears in her manner and words the memory of a vanishing and irreplaceable Europe.

HEADLINE: THE YEAR'S BEST: FILM VIEW;
New and Original Were the Hallmarks

BYLINE: By Vincent Canby

 BODY:
THIS WAS THE YEAR OF MONEY.
It wouldn't stop talking. Japanese interests bought Columbia Pictures and then paid an emperor's ransom to Warner Brothers to obtain the release of Jon Peters and Peter Guber, the producers of ''Batman,'' to run their new toy.
''Batman,'' which reportedly cost $50 million to produce, went on to make the sort of profits only Steven Spielberg dreams of, after receiving reviews so reverent that they read like the fashion-show coverage of the emperor's new wardrobe.
Some stars were asking (and receiving) $10 million or more per picture, which was the total budget of the average movie in the not too distant past. 
A couple of years ago, Cineplex Odeon, the high-flying Canadian exhibition company now facing financial problems, outraged the public (and Mayor Edward I. Koch) when it raised first-run ticket prices in Manhattan to $7. This year the price went up to $7.50. Nobody uttered a word.
It used to be said that you can't take it with you. This new rapacity suggests that a way has been found. It is no coincidence that this year, as last, all but one of the movies on the top-10 list are based on original screenplays, that is, on material initially conceived of as film material. In each case the result is a work that could not exist in another form without serious alteration of identity.
These are films that enlarge the possibilities of cinema by celebrating what would appear (to playwrights, novelists and short story writers) to be the limitations of the screen. Each in its own way defines the medium. It may also be heartening that four of the top 10 also mark the feature-film debuts of their directors. It's not too much to expect that additional good work will follow. In alphabetical order, the 10-best films of 1989 are: ''Chocolat,'' directed by Claire Denis (her first feature) and written (in French) by Miss Denis and Jean-Pol Fargeau. A limited but no less perceptive and evocative recollection of life in Cameroon when it was a French colony in the 1950's, as recalled today by the the daughter of a white French district officer.
The semi-autobiographical film is about the intense but mostly unspoken friendship of a lonely little French girl named France (Cecile Ducasse) and the elegant black house''boy,'' Protee (Isaach de Bankole), the would-be warrior who acts as her de facto nanny. As the elder France (Mireille Perrier) remembers the events of one hot summer, she comes to understand something of the forces that led inexorably to the violent end of trust. Everything that happens is vivid and clear and subject to the kind of speculation that rewards as it tantalizes.
''Chocolat'' is beautifully acted and shot with the kind of clarity that is the cinema equivalent to spare, carefully measured prose.
''Crimes and Misdemeanors,'' written and directed by Woody Allen. Mr. Allen's most successful ''serious'' film is also his most seriously funny comedy, a big, multicharacter piece about how some members of today's upper middle class (in this case Jewish) society might not only get away with murder, but also get away guilt-free.
''Crimes and Misdemeanors'' dramatizes the rootlessness that haunts its characters, played to perfection by Martin Landau, Anjelica Huston, Mia Farrow, Jerry Orbach, Claire Bloom, Joanna Gleason, Sam Waterston and Martin Bergmann. It's a toss-up as to whom steals the show: Alan Alda, as a successful, incredibly self-assured television producer, or Mr. Allen, as a dedicated producer of documentaries that tend to be honored only at obscure film festivals abroad.
''Do the Right Thing,'' written and directed by Spike Lee. With his third feature film, Mr. Lee comes into his own as director of distinctive style, capacity and passion. Set in Brooklyn, in one block of Bedford-Stuyvesant on the hottest day of the summer, the film chronicles the events leading up to a vicious race riot.
The movie is big, colorful, tumultuous and sorrowful. Its resolution continues to shock and disturb long after one leaves the theater. There is, however, no doubt about the mastery of the man who wrote, directed and stars in it. The excellent cast also includes Danny Aiello, Ossie Davis, Ruby Dee, Richard Edson, John Turturro, Giancarlo Esposito, Bill Nunn and the exuberant Rosie Perez.
''Enemies, a Love Story,'' directed by Paul Mazursky and written by Roger L. Simon and Mr. Mazursky, based on the novel by Isaac Bashevis Singer. Nothing Mr. Mazursky has done before has the wit, wisdom and complexity that are evident in ''Enemies, a Love Story,'' the director's finest film to date. Perhaps Mr. Singer is the collaborator for whom he has always been searching.
Set in New York City (mostly Coney Island and the Bronx) in 1949, the film embraces not only the Holocaust, which is tricky material for the maker of fiction, but also the entire Jewish experience. It's about the earnest, feckless Herman (Ron Silver), a Polish Jewish emigre who survived the war hidden in a hayloft, tended by his former housemaid Yadwiga (Margaret Sophie Stein), a Gentile whom he has since married out of gratitude. Unknown to Yadwiga, Herman maintains another household in the Bronx where he lives with the exotic Masha (Lena Olin), a survivor of the death camps who knows all about the Brooklyn wife but makes allowances.
The menage is further complicated by the arrival of Tamara (Anjelica Huston), the Polish wife Herman thought had died in the camps with their children. ''I'm dead,'' Tamara says cheerfully when she arrives at Herman's Brooklyn apartment.
Though Herman is a very peculiar and particular character, he is also - without meaning to be - Everyman. He is a wonderfully hopeful, forlorn fellow whose existence is a bedroom farce played in three-quarter time. ''Enemies'' is funny and sad and, by being utterly specific, mysterious. The performances are among the year's best.
''High Hopes,'' written and directed by Mike Leigh. The subject of this brilliant satire is life in Margaret Thatcher's England as seen from the vantage point of the underemployed and ever-skeptical. The characters include Cyril, a bearded young man who refuses to cooperate with the System and thus works as a messenger; and Shirley, the loving, wise young woman with whom he lives. There are also Cyril's despairing old mum, his wildly ambitious, nouveau riche sister, her gross husband and random Thatcher types, whose scenes are as comic as anything in a political revue.
Mr. Leigh's films are the result of long weeks of rehearsals, during which actors are encouraged to improvise. This may be one of the reasons for the extraordinary spontaneity that lights up ''High Hopes,'' which veers from sober drama to comedy to outright farce without missing a beat.
''Little Vera,'' directed by Vasily Pichul and written (in Russian) by Maryia Khmelik. The unexpected frankness of ''Little Vera'' was so newsworthy that it almost overshadowed the quality of the film itself. This is an exuberant kitchen-sink comedy about a pretty, bored, heavily made-up teen-ager, Vera (Natalya Negoda), who drifts into marriage with a young student who is probably going to make her life miserable.
''Little Vera,'' set in and around an unnamed port city, makes no attempt to see the bright side of the dreary lives of Vera, her exhausted mother, her alcoholic father and her brother, a doctor who lives in Moscow and seems to be well on his way to becoming a pompous bore. Mr. Pichul regards his characters with sympathy, but imposes no hopes on them. The tone is cool. The warmth, of which there is plenty, comes from the humanity of the characters and the actors who play them, especially Miss Negoda. ''Mystery Train,'' written and directed by Jim Jarmusch. Mr. Jarmusch's third released feature is his chef d'oeuvre. The comedy is a three-part fable set in a Memphis, Tenn., where Elvis Presley is still big business. Elvis's ghost also haunts every room of the Arcade Hotel, the seedy establishment that is the film's principal setting.
Mr. Jarmusch's sense of humor illuminates even the most somber settings and most dimwitted characters. It locates the order in a universe that is otherwise beyond comprehension. ''Mystery Train'' is light as a feather. It is also eccentric, original and has the kick of a controlled substance. The great color photography is by Robby Muller.
''Roger & Me,'' written and directed by Michael Moore. This feature-length documentary (Mr. Moore's first film), is one man's blisteringly funny attack on the giant General Motors Corporation, which Mr. Moore holds to account for its treatment of long-time employes in Flint, Mich. The film documents the sad economic state of Flint after the closing of various G. M. operations. Since the film's showing at the New York Film Festival, Mr. Moore has been criticized for the loose way in which he has played around with historical sequence to make his case against the company. This isn't a nice thing to do, and , perhaps Roger Smith, the chairman of G. M., has a right to be offended. However, Mr. Moore might argue, throwing thousands of workers out of their jobs wasn't exactly admirable either.
''Roger & Me'' is clearly one man's biased commentary, the sort of flagrant, opinionated, freewheeling journalism that means to be offensive on behalf of people who have no voice in things. It is personal journalism of a highly original, satiric and colorful order, quite unlike the work of any other documentary film maker at work today.
''Sex, Lies and Videotape,'' written and directed by Steven Soderbergh. Mr. Soderbergh's first feature is a small, stunningly controlled comedy about love, marriage, sex and idle philandering.
At the center is Graham, a romantic if impotent young man who can only relate to women whom he tapes on his camcorder as they talk about their sexual fantasies. There is also John, who is having a torrid affair with Cynthia, the sister of his wife, Ann. Do you follow? Mr. Soderbergh's film makes these relationships completely clear, as well as very funny and rueful. Relationships aren't easy, especially when, as in our society, they are virtually all one talks about.
''Sex, Lies, etc.'' is a remarkable achievement for young Mr. Soderbergh and his principal actors, James Spader, Andie MacDowell, Peter Gallagher and Laura San Giacomo.
''True Love,'' directed by Nancy Savoca and written by Miss Savoca and Richard Guay. An astonishingly fine first film, ''True Love'' is set in the same Bronx that gave us Paddy Chayefsky's ''Marty'' 30-odd years ago. Miss Savoca follows the preparations leading up to the marriage of two good-looking, lower-middle-class Italian-Americans who may well be ruing the day two years later.
The uproariously comic surface of the movie never obscures the probably bleak future awaiting the betrothed pair. Yet the film also seems to understand that this future will somehow be weathered in the same way the pair survive the chaos of their wedding. The film has been written, directed and acted with breathtaking skill. The cast members to remember include Annabella Sciorra (the bride) and Ron Eldard (the groom). The runners-up, in no particular order of importance: Jim Sheridan's ''My Left Foot,'' with Daniel Day-Lewis's extraordinary performance as Christy Brown, the physically disabled, Dublin-born painter and writer; Brian De Palma's ''Casualties of War,'' with Sean Penn and Michael J. Fox, about a Vietnam soldier who blows the whistle on his comrades after they rape and murder a Vietnamese peasant woman; Oliver Stone's ''Born on the Fourth of July,'' based on Ron Kovic's memoir about a radicalized Vietnam vet, played by Tom Cruise in one of the year's most moving performances.
Also, Edward Zwick's ''Glory,'' written by Kevin Jarre, a big, brightly colored, pageantlike account of the heroism of an all-black Union regiment in the Civil War, with Matthew Broderick, Denzel Washington and Morgan Freeman, among others; ''Driving Miss Daisy,'' Bruce Beresford's appreciative screen adaptation of Alfred Uhry's Pulitzer Prize-winning play, with Jessica Tandy and Morgan Freeman.
Also Juzo Itami's ''Taxing Woman's Return,'' in which the most humane and satiric of Japanese directors studies a Japan that is turning to bogus religious cults and Swiss bank accounts; Claude Chabrol's chilly, aggrieved ''Story of Women,'' based on the true story of a rather commonplace, opportunistic young woman (Isabelle Huppert) who finds her calling as an abortionist during World War II and is guillotined more for political than moral reasons.
Also ''Henry V,'' a tough, vivid, pocket-sized screen version of the Shakespeare play, adapted and directed by Kenneth Branagh, who also plays the title role with great efficiency; Gus Van Sant Jr.'s ''Drugstore Cowboy,'' in which Matt Dillon gives a mini-bravura performance as a small-time Portland (Ore.) thief and junkie; and Danny DeVito's ''War of the Roses,'' with super performances by Kathleen Turner and Michael Douglas, a hilariously nasty comedy that is the flip side to all movies in which lovers live happily ever after.

GRAPHIC: Andie MacDowell in Steven Soderbergh's stunningly controlled comedy ''Sex, Lies and Videotape,'' Martin Landau in Woody Allen's ''Crimes and Misdemeanors,'' Mr. Allen's most seriously funny comedy, and Annabella Sciorra and Ron Eldard in Nancy Savoca's astonishingly fine ''True Love''; Cecile Ducasse in Claire Denis's perceptive and evocative ''Chocolat, '' Youki Kudoh and Masatoshi Nagase in Jim Jarmusch's ''Mystery Train, '' a film with the kick of a controlled substance, and Natalya Negoda in Vasily Pichul's ''Little Vera,'' an exuberant kitchen-sink comedy (Biran Hammill); Philip Davis and Ruth Sheen in Mike Leigh's brilliant satire ''High Hopes,'' Spike Lee and Danny Aiello in Mr. Lee's tumultuous and sorrowful ''Do the Right Thing'' and Michael Moore in his blisteringly funny ''

HEADLINE: BROADWAY BUSINESS;
The Sound of Synthetic Music

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Peter Passell's article on the economics of the theater business discusses efforts to reduce some ticket prices (or fatten profits) by cutting labor costs. Falsely claiming that musicians' work rules are ''from the Middle Ages'' and that they deter the use of new technology, Mr. Passell reports ''some accounts'' that ''a few musicians playing synthesizers could now do the work of an entire orchestra.''
In fact, undeterred by our union's work rules, three synthesists in Broadway's current incarnation of ''Sweeney Todd'' are now gamely trying to emulate its original 25-musician orchestration. Most listeners, including your own reviewer, have found the synthetic sound to be inferior. It is only partially true that ''these machines can duplicate the sound of most conventional instruments with uncanny accuracy.'' They can imitate the sounds of single instruments, one note at a time, fairly well. But they are no match for living musicians who are experts at phrasing, the art of connecting one note to another to make an expressive musical statement. And the machines can't begin to generate the excitement that an ensemble of talented musicians, interacting with each other, with the performers on stage and with the audience, can bring to a theatrical production. 
Our labor agreement's requirements for minimum numbers of musicians, varying according to the sizes of theaters, is not ''featherbedding.'' Even with synthesizers, several recent productions have seen fit to employ larger orchestras than required. Most people know that large orchestras produce greater richness annd variety of sound than small ones. Except for your reporter, a few accountants and an insensitive minority of Broadway managers, nearly everyone agrees that our work rules are reasonable - that's why they're still in the agreement, which is renegotiated every three years.
Did you know that the entire cost of the whole orchestra in ''Jerome Robbins's Broadway'' (one of the shows using more musicians than required) is less than $3.50 per ticket? Let's face it, even if no musicians were employed, audiences would still have to fork over more than $56.50 a seat. The Times and theatrical managements should look elsewhere for meaningful savings.

Mirroring Small-Town Life

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Janet Maslin makes a thought-provoking point when she writes that the avoidance of class issues causes American films to ''feel hollow'' [''Class Consciousness: The Pros and Cons,'' Nov. 26.]. But when she criticizes the characters in ''Steel Magnolias'' for looking and sounding alike despite their diverse backgrounds, I think she ignores one of the realities of small-town life.
As someone who has lived in a rural village, a medium-sized city and the New York metropolitan area, I can report that class distinctions are often less pronounced in very small towns, where people of varying backgrounds and economic circumstances frequently live in the same neighborhood and attend the same church - as the characters in the film do.
It's quite possible, I suspect, for a group of small-town Southern women who gather in the same place over a period of years to become fast friends, and grow to sound alike. And, considering that their meeting place is a beauty salon, they might look somewhat alike, too.

HEADLINE: THE YEAR'S BEST: ARCHITECTURE VIEW;
Pei, Prince Charles - and Skyscrapers Everywhere

BYLINE: By Paul Goldberger

 BODY:
IN ARCHITECTURE, THIS WAS SURE-ly the year of I. M. Pei: not a new face, to be sure, but an omnipresent one. In Paris, Mr. Pei's glass pyramid in the court of the Louvre, the object of bitter controversy for years, opened in April to an almost entirely positive reaction. Those who had always thought a crystal pyramid was the right idea for a new entrance and virtual logo for the Louvre rejoiced in self-satisfaction that the 72-year-old Mr. Pei had maneuvered his way through the political thicket so skillfully; the doubters generally came around, moved by the extraordinary beauty of Mr. Pei's exquisitely crafted object and by the extent to which it did allow the older buildings of the Louvre to maintain their integrity. In the end, the quibbles were minor: the way the three little pyramids placed beside the main one trivialized the composition, for example, or the way the staircase was detailed - hardly enough to deny the success of the project as an example of what Mr. Pei does best, which is to create a true civic monumentality in the modernist mode. And that is what the architect did as well in his second major public building to be finished last year, the Morton H. Meyerson Symphony Center in Dallas. Opened in September, the Meyerson could be called a grand concert hall in the new style: it aspires to the luxury and monumentality of the great classical halls, but the architecture is mainly Mr. Pei's modernist geometries. Its swooping shapes of glass and limestone are a bit too abstract on the outside, but inside, the auditorium, which has somewhat of the air of Viennese modernism to it, is warm and pleasing.
Mr. Pei also saw the completion this year of the headquarters for Creative Artists Agency in Beverly Hills, a tiny modernist gem, barely bigger than the houses of certain Hollywood moguls, but more sleek and self-assured than a dozen of them put together. And in Hong Kong, the architect's Bank of China, the tallest building on that explosive skyline, and perhaps his most important skyscraper ever, was finished. But it was also a year for Mr. Pei's longtime design partners, Henry I. Cobb and James Ingo Freed: for the first time, they got their names on the door as the title of the Pei firm was switched on Sept. 1 from I. M. Pei & Partners to Pei Cobb Freed & Partners. Mr. Freed's powerful and complex design for the Holocaust Museum to be built in Washington, which was made public last year, underscored the breadth of design strength that exists within this architectural office.
If I. M. Pei seemed the most attention-getting practicing architect in 1989, surely Prince Charles was the layman who loomed largest over the architectural profession. His criticisms of modernism, which began with a speech in 1984 attacking a proposed addition to the National Gallery in London, reached a fever pitch in 1989 with the publication of his book ''A Vision of Britain'' and the mounting of an exhibition presenting the Prince's views at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. The Prince is now Britain's architect-in-chief in all but official title, as developers have begun to feel it necessary to seek his approval for major projects, and his views seem to have become more and more rear-guard as time has gone on. The Prince's dislike of modern architecture in Britain is not hard to understand - most of it is awful - but his rhetoric seems more likely to encourage sweet and sentimental little classical buildings than the more civilized and urbane modern buildings that are urgently needed.
What does it mean that I. M. Pei, the pre-eminent modernist, and Prince Charles, the ever-more-dogged classicist, together dominated the architectural picture in 1989? Maybe that celebrity, diplomacy and a self-assured, aristocratic bearing count for as much as any ideological position, since if Mr. Pei and the Prince share anything, it is that both are famous, both are good with words and both are as suave as the day is long. What it really tells us, of course, is that the public is not so determined to live only in the world of cozy classical buildings envisioned by the Prince - that under the right circumstances, when modern buildings can be made to possess both the sensuality and the civic grandeur of great classical ones, the public likes them just fine. Many buildings of the past year had nothing to do with either Mr. Pei or the Prince, of course. Among the most memorable were the Canadian Center for Architecture in Montreal, by Peter Rose, and the Wexner Center for the Arts at Ohio State University in Columbus, by Peter Eisenman and Richard Trott. The two buildings make a striking juxtaposition: both cultural institutions, both their architects' first major public buildings, they could not be more different in terms of the design philosophies they represent. The Canadian Center is a subtle and complex essay in stone, metal and wood, a museum and library that beautifully integrates classicism and modernism, and in many ways evokes the spirit of Louis Kahn in its determination to imbue us with a sense of architecture's basics without literally copying from history. It is a building that embodies the very best possibilities of this moment, and it marked an auspicious debut for Peter Rose, who must now be considered among the figures to be reckoned with in North American architecture.
The Wexner Center is a building that seems at once trendier - it is the major American monument in the style of clashing angles called deconstructivism - and more old-fashioned. Designed by Peter Eisenman, a renowned theorist who has at last begun to build actively, it is a building that is intended by its architect to be disquieting, but is in fact less shocking and awkward than the rhetoric surrounding it would have us believe. This building will not be an easy place in which to display art, but many of its interior spaces, as well as the vast gridlike arcade outside it, are powerful architectural experiences. But in its insistent belief that modernity still possesses the ability to throw us out of equilibrium, the real message the building sends is one of nostalgia for the idea of the avant-garde.
It is paradoxical that the year that gave us the Canadian Center for Architecture also saw a threat to the masterpiece by Louis Kahn that in many ways influenced it, the Kimbell Museum in Fort Worth. Last summer the Kimbell announced plans to expand Kahn's 18-year-old building by adding new sections imitative of the original design, in effect turning the building into an architectural version of a stretch limousine. The design, by Romaldo Giurgola, provoked an outcry; 1990 will see whether the Kimbell goes ahead, or decides that it can respect this great building better by leaving it be.
Otherwise, it was a year of more and more skyscrapers everywhere, from the outtowns, those suburban clusters of high-rises beside the interstates, to the downtowns. Stylistically there is a bit more calmness to the major buildings finished in the last year: structures like the NBC and A.T.& T. buildings in Chicago, both by Adrian Smith of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill; the Norwest Center in Minneapolis by Cesar Pelli; 1675 Broadway and 114 East 47th Street in New York by Fox & Fowle, and World Wide Plaza in New York by David Childs of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill all suggest a comfortable but not slavish historicism. These are all buildings that echo the spirit of the towers of the 1920's and 1930's, but they wear their nostalgia gently, and do not copy the past too literally. So, too, with one of the more promising skyscraper designs to be announced in the last year, the proposed new tower for Rockefeller Center in Manhattan by William Pedersen of Kohn Pedersen Fox. In all these projects there is a sense of responsible urbanism, a belief that the tower is part of a larger urban fabric and not a prima donna object in itself - and if there is any accomplishment in the last year, it is the willingness of architects to tone down just a tiny bit the egos that have so dominated design in the last decade. Not a lot, mind you, but a little. A sorry exception is the new design unveiled in late summer for the proposed 42d Street Redevelopment Project in Manhattan, by John Burgee Architects with Philip Johnson; these four towers, controversial since they were first announced in 1981, have now been redesigned as monoliths of deconstructivism, perhaps the neatest marriage of trendiness and gigantism in memory. The buildings are much too big, as they were in 1981; switching architectural style without changing anything else does nothing to address the underlying problems in this project and, indeed, has the sorry effect of enhancing the sense that architecture is merely a matter of fashion - if the style looks tired, don't worry, it can be changed in an instant.
As a new city administration prepares to take office, to be led by a Mayor who has been at least slightly more skeptical of large-scale development than his predecessor, the outlook for the Times Square project is uncertain, even though all official approvals have been obtained. But architecture enters the 1990's with both a weakened economy and a strengthened sense of social responsibility, making the mega-projects of the last few years more than a little problematic. There is more talk of turning architects' talents once again to housing, to schools, to public places. Not the least of the achievements in New York in the last year has been the completion of a major chunk of the city's $5.1 billion housing program, which calls for the renovation or construction of 286,000 housing units for people of low to moderate incomes by 1998, as well as the completion of the prototype for a series of transitional residences for the homeless, designed for the city by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill. The gradual shift in priorities as we move to a new year, and a new decade, would surely have pleased three of architecture's leading lights who died in 1989: Edgar Kaufmann Jr., the architectural historian who helped inspire his family's house, Fallingwater, by Frank Lloyd Wright, and later turned it into a public museum; Percival Goodman, the architect and teacher who specialized in synagogues but for generations was an outspoken advocate of good planning in New York; and Hassan Fathy, the Egyptian architect who engaged in a lifelong struggle to prove that the traditional vernacular architecture of the Middle East was not incompatible with the need to provide adequate housing for a contemporary society. Different men all; what they shared was a love of architecture and a belief that it could enrich the fabric of life.

HEADLINE: PROSPECTS;
Setting High Tech Free

BYLINE: By JOEL KURTZMAN

 BODY:
Earlier this month U S West Inc. made a successful bid to lay a fiber-optics network in the Soviet Union. Last week, the Commerce Department indicated it would allow the deal to go through. The decision could signal a willingness by the United States to ease restrictions on high-tech exports. These exports are currently limited by the Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls, called Cocom, which includes 17 Western countries. Will Cocom change its rules? Four experts discuss its future.
 
Donald M. Kendall
Chairman of the executive committee, Pepsico Inc. 
The Cocom list of restricted technology exports has been expanded beyond our ability to watch it. In the past the list has been very restrictive. When Richard Perle was Assistant Secretary of Defense the list was ridiculous. He even stopped the building of a combine plant on the basis that it could be used to make armored cars.
The list should be confined to something that can be maintained. What we need to do is get together some people from industry and the military and start at ground zero. Cocom should only limit leading-edge technology. Because of our balance of trade problems we have to get aggressive about selling overseas.
 
Roger W. Robinson Jr.
President, R.W.R. Inc., and former senior director for international economic affairs, National Security Council.
Western export controls have been greatly exaggerated as a constraint on the normal conduct of East-West trade. The Cocom regime remains crucial to maintaining the West's qualitative edge in military technology over the Soviet Union's quantitative advantage. Neither Soviet economic nor political reforms are yet irreversible and both espionage and technology theft are on the rise. Despite the best intentions of reformers in Eastern Europe, Moscow still possesses formidable leverage through Warsaw Pact membership, control over energy supplies and as a market for Eastern Europe's exports. An across-the-board exemption which significantly expands East European access to militarily relevant Western technology is therefore premature.
 
Arthur Hartman
Senior consultant, Apco Associates, and former ambassador to the Soviet Union.
Changes in Cocom have been long overdue. The procedure has to be simplified and brought up to date. Over the last four years there has been a reduction in the list of restricted items and a change from restricting individual items to restricting specific systems and processes. Most joint ventures themselves don't require very high technology. But what happens is that now even simple technologies are hooked up with computers and that limits them.
But Cocom isn't really holding up trade. Lack of foreign exchange on the Soviet Union's part and an inability to make decisions and plan what they want is what's holding up trade with the Soviet Union.
 
Ed Hewett
Senior fellow, the Brookings Institution.
I don't think the overall impact of Cocom is that important. A lot of Soviet factories are museum pieces. It would be a boon for them just to have 1970's technology. And that is what Soviet factories will want once they are decentralized to the point that they are paying for the technology they want to import.
But one area where Cocom is significant is with Soviet defense companies that want to enter into joint ventures with Western companies. These companies are looking for partners in manufacturing. They are the best companies in the Soviet Union. They know quality but they have high production costs. With the right manufacturing partners they could do much better. By restricting joint ventures, Cocom ultimately will limit the flow of new Soviet technology back to the United States.
My guess is we'll see the Cocom list of restricted exports shrink when Commerce Secretary Mosbacher gets out in front on the issue.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS FORUM: THE COST OF CAPITAL;
How to Make Raising Money Cheaper

BYLINE: By WILLIAM FARLEY; William Farley is chairman and chief executive of Farley Industries.

 BODY:
THE acceleration of Japanese purchases of American corporate icons like Rockefeller Center, Columbia Pictures and CBS Records should come as no surprise, given the huge advantage that the Japanese enjoy in capital costs. Recent studies have found that America's capital is between 2 1/2 and 4 times as expensive as Japan's. Inexpensive capital has given the Japanese a booming manufacturing sector and ample cash with which to purchase foreign assets.
Why is Japan's capital so much cheaper? According to George Hatsopoulos, an expert on the cost of capital, the differential results from three factors:
First, Japanese companies are able to obtain more of their financing in low-cost debt or debt-like instruments, while the structure of the American financial system dictates that American companies rely on expensive equity financing. Japanese debt-to-equity ratios are roughly 3-to-1, while ours are 1-to-3. 
Second, the Japanese save more than three times as much of their incomes as Americans, thereby creating a greater pool of capital for investment within their country.
Third, tax policy in Japan helps reduce the cost of capital by encouraging savings and investment.
The general perception about Japan's advantage in the cost of capital is that it is the result of interest rate subsidies. But subsidies are not as critical as the differences in debt-equity ratios. Tradition in the United States require that balance sheets be heavily weighted toward equity and that corporations be debt-adverse. In Japan, debt and debt-like instruments are common. It is becoming increasingly clear that in the 1990's, American companies will be reducing their debt while they increase their reliance on equity financing.
The problem with America's reliance on equity financing is that it is extremely expensive. It is expensive because entrepreneurs must give away a piece of the company.
Here is a very simplified example of how costly equity financing can be, particularly for a rapidly growing company. Let's assume that you have a venture for which you need to obtain $5 million in start-up capital. Let's also say you believe that in 10 years the company will be worth $100 million.
If you can borrow the money from a commercial bank at 10 percent interest, over 10 years you will pay $5 million in interest. If you can sell high-yield bonds at say 15 percent, you will pay $7.5 million in interest over 10 years. But if you had to give up a modest 25 percent in equity to get that $5 million - and if you pay no dividends - you will end up giving up $20 million in value. Even though this is a simplistic example, which does not account for inflation, it is clear that debt is much cheaper.
The implications of the cost-of-capital differentials are scary. Hindered by the high cost of capital, American business cannot afford to reinvest as much as the Japanese or invest in high-risk endeavors that can create enormous leaps in technology.
The cost-of-capital problem is a major threat to America's economic future. If today's politicians do not act to lower the cost of equity capital, they risk stalling the economy. Their short-sighted tax and spending policies helped put us at a competitive disadvantage. The tax changes from 1981 to 1986 increased our capital costs by as much as 90 percent, according to a June 1990 special report from the American Council for Capital Formation.
ALTHOUGH the 1986 tax revision package made some progress toward the elimination of incentives for over-consumption, it did not take the steps necessary to stimulate savings and investment. On balance, we still have a tax system that does not promote economic growth.
For individuals, we can restore preferential treatment of capital gains, reduce the limitations on individual retirement accounts and move toward consumption-based taxes. For business, dividend deductibility would slice into Japan's capital cost advantage, because it would make equity more like debt.
American politicians must stop treating the symptoms of the high cost of capital and start treating the disease. Their predilection for short-term solutions has only made our long-term economic problems worse. Growing Japanese ownership of American assets can be stopped by legislative actions. But these legislative actions should be aimed at lowering the cost of capital and restoring America's competitiveness. America does not have to have more expensive capital than Japan. The slogan of one Japanese car manufacturer is ''inexpensive and built to stay that way.'' That applies to Japan's capital as well. America's capital is expensive and unless Congress takes steps to lower capital costs by reducing the budget deficit and increasing incentives for savings and investment, it will stay that way. If we reduce the cost of capital, we can keep America American.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS FORUM: THE COST OF CAPITAL;
Don't Give Up on Junk Bonds

BYLINE: By GLENN YAGO; Glenn Yago is director of the economic research bureau at the W. Averill Harriman School of management at State University of New York.

 BODY:
RECENTLY, I participated on a panel with leaders of the House and Senate to discuss mechanisms for increasing investment in distressed communities. None of the communities or minority businesses we discussed were investment grade. Rather, they were completely unbankable, and most credit analyses by rating agencies would classify them as ''junk'' investments.
Nevertheless, warm from the witch hunt against Michael Milken and studying further capital market regulations that will limit capital access, the Congressional panel members reveled in sucker-punching the junk-bond market for its 3 percent decline for the quarter. 
Yet, what the panel didn't know is that in the context of American financial history, junk bonds are nothing new. High-yielding financial innovations started with the Republic. As business historian Robert Sobel of Hofstra University has documented, the earliest junk bond was issued by Alexander Hamilton to refinance the costs of the Revolutionary War. Zero-coupon bonds, convertible bonds and other hybrid instruments financed the railroads, the development of the Western states and the growth of the oil industry at the turn of the century. This was long before they financed the RJR Nabisco deal. Before Carl C. Icahn and his purchase of T.W.A., secured equipment trust bonds helped diversify freight and passenger railroads and build public utilities. Preferred stocks were popular among new industrial issues at the turn of the century. Simple and straight debt that yielded high interest rates financed the acquisition of U.S. Steel by J. P. Morgan and the restructuring of Goodyear Tire and Rubber by Dillon Read in 1921.
The risk of default among high-yield companies has been widely exaggerated. Failure rates of high-yield issuers and leveraged buyouts and their spinoffs are remarkably less than for American businesses as a whole. Even one widely quoted study that claims a 34 percent default rate for new high-yield issuers translates into a modest 2.8 percent annual average default rate if the time horizon is extended over a period of 12 years. This study identified only 78 defaults out of a universe of 1,500. Yet, despite these defaults, those 1,500 issuers provided investors with an average positive return of 8.5 percent annually, a rate which over the same period compared favorably with Treasuries or high-grade corporate bonds.
Companies that have issued high-yield securities create jobs at four times the average rate for all companies. They experience a one-third greater growth in productivity, 50 percent higher growth in sales and about three times faster growth in capital spending.
The empirical evidence for leveraged buyouts - financing which depends only in part (15-25 percent) on high-yield securities - is similar. In what has come to be known as the decade of restructuring, the 1980's saw a takeovers, leveraged buyouts, divestitures and spinoffs financed through new financial technologies.
Through such recapitalizations, companies have consolidated excess capacity in various industries and enabled a number of low-margin, low-market-share operations to consolidate into higher-margin, higher-market-share businesses. The sale or spinoff of unrelated businesses has been part of this restructuring process.
According to our studies, restructured companies reverse declines in sales, productivity and capital spending. They are less likely to close and thereby cause less job loss. The productivity of factories owned by companies with leveraged buyouts runs about 14 percent higher than factories in companies without leveraged buyouts. The productivity advantage is closer to 20 percent in factories with high management and employee ownership participation, as new owners realize they must focus their business on projects with a high promise of success.
AS junk grew, so did the value of the underlying equity in company financial structures. John Pound, a researcher at Harvard University, found that high-yield issuers generally increased cash flow, earnings, dividend payments, sales and capital spending at a rate that was greater than the expectations at the time of issue. Price-earnings ratios approximately doubled on average, and price/cash-flow multiples increased by about 10 percent after the debt placement.
At its best, the high-yield market reintegrated management and owners, investment and control, and promoted lower capital costs through new institutional arrangements that should be furthered in the 1990's. By shifting the focus from passive to active investors, the high-yield market accomplished what legislators now seek to inhibit - the development of financial institutions and markets that could keep economic growth alive.

HEADLINE: Fixing the Dollar

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In ''The Floating Dollar Needs an Anchor'' (Business Forum, Nov. 19), David Ranson states that the dollar is an unstable unit and does not inspire confidence. I could not agree more. His suggestion to fix the value of the dollar to a set basket of commodities deserves serious consideration by the Congress, particularly now when inflation, an ever-present threat, can cause the dollar to depreciate.
As far back as 1937, no less an expert than Benjamin Graham, one of America's most highly respected authorities in the field of investing, advocated securing the currency with approximately 20 basic commodities which would be stored at suitable locations throughout the nation. The value of the underlying commodities would protect the currency against wide variations in value and, at the same time, stabilize the prices of the commodities.
The Senate seemed to agree. In March 1937 the chamber passed the Crop Insurance Bill, under which such stored commodities would be covered by all-risk insurance provided by a Government agency. The bill was introduced in the House and favorably reported by the Committee on Agriculture, but was not acted upon prior to adjournment.
Now is the time for this proposition to be submitted to the legislators anew.

To the Editor:
It seems incomprehensible that learned economists would advocate gold as a cure for inflation. (''Conduct a Test of a Gold Standard,''
 
Business Forum, Nov. 19.) 
Gold is basically an index of anxiety with little other use. Since the start of civilization the entire world has produced less than 3 billion ounces, a minuscule amount when compared to other metals. Seven percent has had industrial application, 16 percent wound up in jewelry.
The vast majority of gold is produced by South Africa and Russia. It would be obvious exegesis to delineate the horrific state of those two countries' economies and the value of their currencies.
The No. 1 factor in this country's fight against inflation is productivity. Japan, with sparse natural resources, has concentrated on productivity with obvious results. Wake up, America!

HEADLINE: PORTRAIT OF THE 1980's;
Back in 1979, The Word Was Malaise

BYLINE: By GEORGE JOHNSON

 BODY:
THE 1970's were not all bad by any means. But by the time 1979 was entering its final weeks, feelings of gloom were so heavy that even some of President Carter's detractors had to admit he had a point: the country was suffering from a bad case of malaise. Sometimes it seemed that the decade would never end.
For those looking ahead to the 1980's, it was hard to be optimistic. People were predicting rising oil prices, more inflation and an escalating cold war. Howard J. Ruff's ''How to Prosper During the Coming Bad Years'' spent most of 1979 on the best-seller lists. The best-selling nonfiction book of the decade was the evangelist Hal Lindsey's apocalyptic ''Late, Great Planet Earth.'' 
''For the better part of the past two years nobody has been safe from the divinations of the new decade,'' Lewis H. Lapham complained in Harper's Magazine. ''Almost without exception, the seers who look into the abyss of the 1980's predict catastrophes appropriate to the fears of the audience they have been paid to inform and alarm.''
But it was not only the professional prognosticators who were worried. By the end of December, the hostages were in their second month of captivity in the American embassy in Teheran. To America's eyes, Iran itself was being held hostage to Islamic fundamentalism, a force that seemed ready to engulf the Middle East. The Soviets began airlifting troops into Afghanistan, ostensibly to suppress an Islamic revolt. So much for detente. With Soviet expansionism unleashed again, any hopes that the Senate would ratify the SALT II accord faded toward nothingness. Mutual stockpiles of nuclear weapons seemed as permanent as the Berlin wall.
Back home, a different kind of nuclear fear hung in the air from the Three Mile Island accident that spring. Millions of television viewers who had watched the chillingly technical descriptions of what they feared would be a meltdown - the China Syndrome they had seen at the movies - were suddenly very sure that they didn't want nuclear power. But the options looked just as bleak. With soaring oil prices and fears of another OPEC squeeze, the White House was talking about a 50-cent-a-gallon gasoline tax for 1980 and an emergency rationing plan. With hopes blackened by double-digit inflation and crushing interest rates, Paul A. Volcker, the new Federal Reserve chairman, said the country would just have to get used to a lower standard of living.
With America's own fundamentalist revolt stirring, political commentators foresaw the rise of a conservative Christian voting bloc -good news to the rekindled presidential hopes of Ronald Reagan. Demographers were predicting that as the baby boom aged, the country would be dominated by a new conservatism, trying to hold onto a way of life that seemed to be slipping away.
While it was hard to hold out much hope for political or ecological harmony, technology seemed unstoppable. Jimmy Carter called for a national solar energy policy and synthetic fuels. In a report on the coming 1980's, U.S. News & World Report made this prediction: ''Parked in the typical family's garage in 1989 will be a small, two-seater electric car for commuting and a diesel van for weekends and vacations.''
Ten years ago, in a 1970's retrospective, a writer for The Week in Review predicted that by 1989 ''smart telephones will switch calls to wherever the subscriber is, and televisions will hang on the walls like pictures. Automobiles will be programmed to avoid skids and collisions.'' Nearly everybody believed that the space shuttle would make flights into orbit almost as routine as air travel.
Viewed from its beginning, a decade can seem like an endless expanse; then, 10 years later, it turns out to be finite after all.

HEADLINE: PORTRAIT OF THE 1980's;
Trivial Pursuits And Huge Thoughts

 BODY:
Like any other decade, this one got a reputation as trivial in the arts-and-literature department. In films, Americans wanted things kept light. At the same time, they bought books about chaos, the decline of their nation and the closing of their mind. 
 
Best Sellers
The best-seller lists of the decade were dominated by the usual celebrity biographies, horror and espionage tales, exercise manuals, guides to making love and money, inspirational stories about animals and political memoirs. But bookstore windows were occasionally graced by best-sellers that helped shape what people talked and thought about, books that everybody had to know about and maybe even read.
At the beginning of the decade, Norman Cousins's Anatomy of an Illness celebrated the healing powers of the spirit and holistic medicine. Hopes that all the world would enter a New Age of enlightenment were reflected in futuristic tracts like Alvin Toffler's Third Wave and John Naisbitt's Megatrends. According to other books, the salvation would be laissez-faire economics: Free to Choose, by Milton and Rose Friedman, and Wealth and Poverty by George Gilder.
This was the decade when business magnates and corporate raiders became stars. Along with Iacocca and Trump were attacks on business and finance: Greed and Glory on Wall Street (Ken Auletta), The Reckoning (David Halberstam).
Journalists became historians and covered events as ancient as The Trial of Socrates (I. F. Stone) and as recent as The Path to Power, the first volume of Robert A. Caro's biography of Lyndon Johnson. In A Bright Shining Lie, Neil Sheehan showed how one corrupt military leader personified the contradictions of Vietnam.
The historian Paul Kennedy's Rise and Fall of the Great Powers warned that for centuries superpowers have run through predictable cycles of domination and decline. In The March of Folly, Barbara Tuchman showed how shortsighted leaders keep marching their countries to ruin's brink.
Books seeking to explain the mysteries of science were especially popular: Tracy Kidder's Soul of a New Machine, Stephen W. Hawking's Brief History of Time, James Gleick's Chaos. The physicist Richard P. Feynman wrote two surprising best-sellers, with the help of his friend Ralph Leighton: ''Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman'' and ''What Do You Care What Other People Think?'' In The Man Who Mistook His Wife For A Hat, the neurologist Oliver Sacks told readers true stories of brains gone haywire. In Under the Eye of the Clock, a young quadriplegic poet named Christopher Nolan, who learned to type with a unicorn stick attached to his forehead, told what it is like to navigate through life with a damaged nervous system.
A few novelists managed to tap the intellectual currents of the decade and produce fiction popular enough to be sold in grocery stores. Umberto Eco drew on semiotics and medieval theology for The Name of the Rose. John Updike filled the pages of Roger's Version with modern religious controversies, physics and computer science.
Toward the end of the decade, books titillated readers with warnings that civilization was breaking down: Tom Wolfe in his novel The Bonfire of the Vanities, Allan Bloom in his treatise The Closing of the American Mind. In Cultural Literacy, E. D. Hirsch Jr. provided a list of facts he thought Americans should know - and probably didn't. To John Allen Paulos the problem was not only illiteracy but Innumeracy.
One best-seller owed its success not to its content but to what it symbolized. People all over the world bought Salman Rushdie's Satanic Verses to show dictators and bookstore chains that readers won't stay silent when a writer is condemned to death for his prose.

HEADLINE: PORTRAIT OF THE 1980's;
Some Lines On the Rest of The Millennium

 BODY:
Where is the world headed? The Week in Review asked a number of people to hazard some predictions about life in the 1990's. Some stuck their necks out farther than others, but, if experience is any guide, all of us are in for surprises.
 
Economic Warfare
The long and tortuous contest between capitalism and Communism is coming to an end. We'll all declare capitalism victorious and then discover a curious thing, that there are two quite different forms of capitalism. One might be called a cosmopolitan capitalism, in which national boundaries are irrelevant; the free market reigns supreme. The other form might be called national capitalism, in which governments join with the private sector to advance national interests. Japan, South Korea, East Asia will be the centers of national capitalism. Instead of technology embedded in weapons systems, the new contest will be over goods and services.
The most fortunate and skilled among us will find themselves with ever-larger markets willing to pay them ever-larger sums. The least fortunate and skilled will find themselves competing with workers all over the globe willing to work for a fraction of the wages. - Robert Reich, Economist
 
The Democrats will finally give up trying to micromanage the economy and produce a candidate who understands the nature of growth in the U.S. and around the world and who will give the Republicans a serious run for power.
We may have had an end of history in the Francis Fukuyama sense, in terms of victory of democracy over command economies. It really will be a contest between entrepreneurial capitalism and state corporate capitalism, what we used to call fascism. Our advantage is in entrepreneurial capitalism, so I'd expect a contest of those ideas, both of which may in fact be legitimate. - Jude Wanniski, Political Economist
 
Class and Race
After two decades of Reagan-Bush policies, we'll be increasingly divided along lines of class, which will mean among other things that there will be more and more homeless people, and we can expect them to be organized into nomadic bands who will be in rural and suburban areas as well as the cities. The overclass - the top 10 or 15 percent - will probably not grow any more and become less visible as it retreats into guarded enclaves.
However, there will be new social movements; probably they will call themselves democracy movements -movements of the poor and of students. I think there will be students who will be increasingly unwilling to take their places in an isolated and arrogant overclass. And I think more of these movements will be led by women. - Barbara Ehrenreich, Writer
 
We will see for the first time social policies designed to address the problems of poverty, education, employment and labor market efficiency simultaneously. There seems to be a growing recognition that these problems are interrelated and that if they are not addressd the country will face a major economic disaster by the year 2000. Some will support this policy out of concern for fate of minorities, but it will draw even greater support because of concern over the devastating effect that a poorly trained work force will have on the economy in the decade ahead. - William Julius Wilson, Sociologist
 
If the business community keeps up the pressure and Washington provides the leadership, we have a chance for overhauling public education in the new decade. It is not a question of whether politically it is going to happen - it has to happen. If this President does not do it, then the next Presidential campaign will be fought over this issue. Our place as a world economic power is at risk, as is our ability to maintain the quality of life in this country. - Donna Shalala, Educator
 
Pressured Planet
The 90's will be the make it or break it decade in terms of conservation worldwide and especially in the tropics where the bulk of the world's biological diversity is found. We're facing a wide variety of problems from ozone layer depletion and global warming to soil and water and air pollution and toxic waste disposal and acid rain. But to me the single most important conservation issue is the loss of the planet's biological diversity because that's the biological capital, the resource base on which we depend for our own survival. We can develop technologies to combat most forms of pollution but once we lose a species of plant or animal it's gone forever. - Russell A. Mittermeier, Conservationist
 
I think the record since 1970 has proved the adage to expect the unexpected when it comes to energy. Are we going to see a real rebound in energy demands in industrial countries and even more so in developing countries? Then the question becomes how to meet that demand.
In the 90's the environment will provide the incentive for conservation rather than security or price. And the environment will provide the motivation for looking again at the portfolio of alternatives, an effort that fell by the wayside in the 1980's. But I don't see anybody rushing to sign up to build a new nuclear power plant. - Daniel Yergin, Energy Consultant
 
Return of Beauty
Art is not going to go on the way it did in New York in the 60's. It's been a long time since there was anything remotely like a new art movement. That doesn't mean there is not a lot of interesting work being done. I just don't think that it's historically important. I don't know what an art world would be like that reconciled itself to the fact that the borderlines are now understood and the task of art is no longer to drive them into the unknown. Who knows, beauty may make a new appearance.
I think there will be a decentralization of artistic creativity. There have been so many new museums and socially they are the most important institutions we have. Each will be a center of some kind and people will be using them for all sorts of purposes. Artists will have all kinds of things to do when they no longer feel they have to come to New York. - Arthur C. Danto, Art critic and philosopher
 
It's very depressing. There are lot of fairly sinister attacks on artists and their works. There must be a struggle on the part of artists, organizations and institutions to protect the work of artists, writers and visual artists, cineastes and so on. The attacks tend to make government support rhetorical, and they tend to persuade large communities of people that their lives are threatened by candor. But even if the struggle is protracted, we, the artists, will prevail. - Toni Morrison, Novelist
 
With Governments Of Their Own
There will be cooperation and mutual understanding between Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary. Ecological problems in that area are awful. Those countries fight for their survival in an ecological sense.
I see good chances of democracy in those countries, but economic problems are tremendous. There is a great readiness of the populations to go along with hardships, provided the governments are considered their own. - Czeslaw Milosz, Writer
 
Unity of Germany will be achieved in the next decade, in one way or another; it is almost inevitable. It will have to come through the agreement of outside powers and will be dependent on the shape of the European Community and events in the Soviet Union.
In Eastern Europe Communism is very much finished. Democracy may turn out to be a very fragile development. The possibility of right-wing dictatorship or authoritarian regimes is not excluded. Much will depend on how those governments deal with their economic problems; one cannot be overly optimistic on that. - Adam B. Ulam, Historian
 
Espionage activity between the East and West will increase. As you draw down your military strength, there is an increase in the amount of information you need. The relative threat tends to increase as military strength decreases. You have to increase your warning time.
Increased intelligence gathering will focus not on capabilities - you get that from satellites - but on intentions. And to gather information about intentions, you have to do human intelligence. You don't get that from a satellite.
The world is in the best shape it's been in my lifetime. Marxism is dying at the roots. No natural law says America has to have an external enemy. But if there is anything we've learned in the past 12 months it is how fast things can change. - Tom Clancy, Novelist
 
Manipulating Mind and Life
The next 10 years will bring us just to the beginning of general purpose robots - the PC with arms and legs and eyes. I think developments will be pretty small in 10 years but it will be the beginning of an industry that will eventually absorb everything else. In 40 years the robot will in some ways be equal to a human in its ability to move around and see; in other ways it will be tremendously superhuman. Somewhere in between there will be a machine that will probably be able to earn its living. It will be physically inadequate and clumsy but logically it will be a match for most people and probably more diligent.
As machines eventually acquire all the capabilities of humans and lots more besides, humans will become superfluous. Do we gracefully bow out to what amounts to our children or do we join them? We will be able to make ourselves smarter using the same techniques that make machines smarter. - Hans Moravec, Computer Scientist
 
The novel field that will emerge in the 90's will be organ replacement with biologically synthesized organs. Bone marrow transplantation will also become common and that will eliminate blood cancer and blood diseases. As a teen-ager you could put down a marrow sample and know that 40 years later you'd be protected against a whole variety of cancers.
I suspect that we will have a broadbased knowledge of genetic causes that will enable us to identify diseases early - both the obvious genetic disorders like cystic fibrosis and muscular dystrophy and common diseases such as heart disease, predisposition to cancer and probably mental illnesses. During the decade we will probably come to know about half of all the human genes, compared with maybe 1 percent now. Suddenly we'll have a different grasp of how the human body develops from an egg and a different grasp of human evolution -and all of evolution. - Walter Gilbert, Molecular biologist

HEADLINE: Shall We Dance?;
As Two Worlds Warm, A Post-Postwar Order Awaits

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
RETROSPECT often makes the most recent moments seem the most vivid. That is usually a trick that our minds play upon us, but surely not in the 1980's. The pictures of Berliners dancing upon, pouring through, chipping hunks out of their hated wall, symbolizing the end of 45 years of cold war, seem incredible now, and surely they and what they epitomize will still seem extraordinary in the next century.
For they mark the climax of a decade and the end of the world order that had its origins in the ashes of World War II. To two generations and more, ''normal'' seemed to mean East vs. West, as for tens or hundreds of years in the past it meant Germany vs. France or Christians vs. Muslims. Suddenly, as a hurricane of change blew across Eastern Europe this fall, through Prague and Sofia and East Berlin and Budapest and at last Bucharest, through the lives of millions whom Marxism had ruled but never wholly subjugated, the wall and the cold warriors who built it seemed as out of date as the forts of Malta, beneath which the last summit conference of the 1980's took place, and the Crusaders who manned them. 
Who would have predicted it, 3,600 days ago, at the dawn of the decade, with Jimmy Carter preparing his campaign for a second term in a country that was down on itself after defeat in Vietnam and humiliation in Iran? With Leonid I. Brezhnev clinging grimly to life and power in a Soviet Union whose vulnerabilities had been detected by only a few keen experts in the West, and in a Communist bloc that seemed totally under his thumb?
Ronald Reagan, fated to be one of the two leading players of the 1980's, was to step into the spotlight in that first year of the decade and to stay there for nine years. In the end, though, he was upstaged by Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who began the decade as an obscure apparatchik in Stavropol but ended it as the man of the decade, the father of glasnost and perestroika.
Which is not to denigrate the role of the brave men and women who fought, without guns or tanks or hand grenades, for human rights and human liberties - celebrated people like Lech Walesa and the late Andrei D. Sakharov, as well as anonymous ones like the students of Prague, the Lutherans of Leipzig and the marchers of Timisoara and Bucharest.
But as Dr. Sakharov himself wrote not too long before his death, it was Mr. Gorbachev, for all his failings, who made the decisions ''that completely changed the situation in the Soviet Union and the psychology of its people.''
Without Mikhail Sergeyevich Gorbachev, the cold war would have ended in the 1990's or the 2010's or sometime, but assuredly not in the 1980's.
Some would argue that the United States and its allies ''won'' the cold war by applying relentless military pressure, giving Mr. Reagan's vaunted arms buildup much of the credit, and it is no doubt true that without vigilance during the era of Soviet hostility things would have been different.
But it was the utter failure of the Marxist economies that set the stage for Mr. Gorbachev's reforms and signaled the demise of traditional Communism, and if heavy military spending contributed to that failure, it also helped make the United States a debtor nation.
Much was made of Mr. Reagan's military muscle-flexing, including the invasion of Grenada, the bombing of Libya and the war by proxy in Nicaragua, but the egregious Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi remains in power, and things haven't changed all that much in Central America.
Indeed, President Bush had to invade Panama in the decade's waning days to achieve a Reagan goal, the ouster of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
Mr. Reagan did manage to reduce the frequency of terrorist attacks, though a Pan American jet was blown up only last Christmas. Through the judicious application of American power, he helped install a fragile democratic government in Manila.
For a time, the tide of freedom seemed to be running in China as well, where the introduction of limited capitalism temporarily carried in its wake limited democracy. But that link was broken with the massacres in Tiananmen Square, which, like so many of the seminal events of the decade - the destruction of the spacecraft Challenger also leaps to mind - were engraved on the public eye by the modern magic of global television.
But Ronald Reagan was a domestic President, more than anything else, his two terms marked by a giddy celebration of free enterprise and its bounty, of American pride and patriotism, and of family values.
At its best, the Reagan Presidency provided a tonic of self-confidence that helped to restore vigor to the national economy and psyche; at its worst, it fostered greed, chauvinism and intolerance.
Its monuments were an economic boom of unprecedented length, the uprooting of much bureaucratic underbrush and a vastly heightened sense of national unity; its failures the scandals and then the crash in Wall Street, the intractable budget deficit and the resultant starvation of programs to aid the homeless and the drug-ridden.
Mr. Reagan planted the Republican standard on the hilltop and kept it there throughout the decade. If he fell short of his goal to make his party the new majority, he redefined, for the moment at least, the parameters of American politics, forcing even the opposition to address his agenda (viz. the hapless Michael S. Dukakis driving a tank to earn his macho credentials).
Yet by decade's end, Mr. Reagan, out of office less than a year and still one of the most popular figures in postwar American history, seemed curiously passe.
The ''evil empire'' had vanished, Ivan Boesky and Leona Helmsley, the paramount symbols of greed, were paying the price, nobody talked about the yuppies much any more, and the serious problems seemed more serious than ever to many people. The 1980's were the decade of AIDS and of the homeless, of ever-mounting threats to the environment and ever-widening concern about the quality of American education, and of fresh doubts about the very viability of the American political system.
Whether because they saw little need for the Government to act or because they questioned the ability of the politicians to make a difference, fewer people than ever bothered to vote. Fewer officeholders than ever seemed to excite wide admiration, and it was an age of scandal, of what some saw as an absurd preoccupation with personal behavior: Jim Wright, Douglas Ginsburg, Gary Hart. Neither the budgetary system nor the legislative process seemed to function very well any more, and electoral campaigns, more and more trivial, more and more dominated by the political consultants instead of the candidates, did little to set alternative policies or programs before the electorate.
The doubts extended to America's role as a world economic power. The 1980's were the decade when the astounding rise of Japan (and of smaller Pacific nations like Taiwan and South Korea) began to cause real angst in the United States. The omnipresence of Japanese cars and television sets, the purchase by the Japanese of iconographic American assets like Columbia Pictures and Rockefeller Center, and the new dominance of Japanese banks, set American teeth on edge, giving new life to the old idea of tariff barriers.
Looking ahead, many in the United States foresaw similarly tough competition coming from Europe, where greater economic and perhaps political integration, scheduled for 1992, would threaten American business from the other flank unless it could become more efficient and more innovative.
For some seers, such as the historian Paul Kennedy, the great paradox is this: at the very moment when the United States, as the leader of the West's protracted crusade for capitalism and democracy, should be savoring victory, it may well be an empire doomed to a long, slow economic decline.
And yet, and yet . . . If the 1980's proved anything, they proved once again the power of ideas, and the ideas that have triumphed have been those of the great American experiment. Even in the third world, with its seemingly limitless suffering, where Marxism was for so long the intellectual fashion, the free-market alternative has been embraced by some with eagerness and by others with reluctance. A few African nations are headed up that path, as is Argentina, led by a Peronist.
The Middle East remains locked in its dismal strife, China bedevils George Bush and remains an enigma, the whole world worries about pollution and the greenhouse effect and the fate of the rain forests, to say nothing about feeding a population that passed five billion in the decade that ends in just a week. There is no dearth of problems, and many of them face Eastern Europe, the arena of the great victory of the 1980's, as it copes with the 1990's.
But who can begrudge the old decade its last Christmas present and most vivid symbol: the wall breached at the Brandenburg Gate in the heart of Berlin, nearly 50 years after the end of World War II, 200 years after the first of Europe's great revolutions swept France.

HEADLINE: The No-Parent Child

 BODY:
On Nov. 27, Baby Boy W. was born in Brooklyn four weeks early and with test signs of cocaine and syphilis. He is the youngest of three children whose mother is an unemployed crack addict who has dropped out of drug treatment. She has not seen Baby Boy W. since his birth and he is now a candidate for adoption. But who will adopt such a child?
The number of abused and neglected children is soaring in New York City, straining the foster care system. The most poignant victims, like Baby Boy W., are the children of drug-abusing mothers. But laws, regulations and practices deny even less-troubled foster children, from toddlers to teen-agers, the chance to grow up in a stable environment. Mayor-elect David Dinkins faces several principal priorities when he takes over next week, including unusual fiscal care. But none can be more urgent than doing better by these children. Even assuming there is a social safety net, these are blameless victims who have fallen through. 
New York's child welfare problems are not unique. A recent Congressional study found that child abuse, drug and alcohol abuse and homelessness are contributing to the increasing numbers of children in costly out-of-home placements. For New York City, the figures are sobering. In 1977, the city's foster care population was about 23,700. Then the population began to decline, probably because child welfare experts worked harder to keep families together. But in 1985, as is clear from the accompanying graph, the trend reversed. Now the figure is 38,000; it could top 50,000 within a year.
Complaints of child abuse and neglect have risen to 60,000 this year, from 18,500 in 1979, and children are coming into the foster care system at a younger age. Some 58 percent of children entering the system are now under the age of 6, an increase of 11 percentage points in only three years. This year, about 4,800 babies will be born to drug-addicted mothers, making them almost certain candidates for foster care.
Child welfare experts unanimously blame crack, which is much more popular with women than is heroin, for the recent surge in the foster care caseload. As Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan says, child welfare used to concern the one-parent family. Now, largely because of drugs, it concerns the no-parent child.
As caseloads grow, so do horror stories from the city's Human Resources Administration. Children are removed from abusive parents and placed with poorly supervised foster families who often abuse them more, sometimes to death . . . Children languish for years in foster homes when they could be adopted . . . City Council President Andrew Stein cites heart-rending cases of children placed with foster parents prepared to adopt, only to be yanked away and returned to their severely troubled natural mothers.
The reasons for such failures are numerous and complex. The city and state argue about which should pay for which services to children. The child welfare law is interpretable as putting a mother's rights before those of her child. Child welfare agencies generally prefer to place children in individual families rather than develop more small group facilities. There is a continuing need to train and motivate many more caseworkers.
Beneath all these issues lies the basic structural problem that has troubled the Human Resources Administration for years. Unlike most cities, New York relies heavily on private, sectarian agencies to care for foster children. About 70 agencies offer expertise and well-run facilities, and the city provides them with more than $650 million in contracts.
In theory, the city is supposed to be in charge. In practice, the agencies wield great power. Until a decade ago, H.R.A. did not even formally evaluate them. The agencies, set up for a foster care problem of a different era, have been slow to adjust.
Right now, they conspicuously underserve three populations: babies of drug-addicted mothers, children with special medical needs and children with severe behavioral problems. As their numbers grow, the city has begun programs to serve them directly - a still tenuous attempt to maintain control of child welfare policy over the more selective interests of the private agencies.
The Dinkins administration needs to understand the importance of controlling the sectarian agencies more closely, for the stakes are large.
Foster care constitutes a crisis. How can a purportedly decent society cast its youngest, most vulnerable members adrift into a no-parent world? But that's what this society is doing. When no one pays enough attention to physical, educational and emotional needs of children, eventually, everyone will pay dearly.
The population of these children, abandoned in all but name, is growing and changing too fast for the systems in place to help them. That hard fact casts an alarming shadow over the city's future.

HEADLINE: Congress Wasn't Meant to Be a Lifetime Job

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''Congress, a School for Scandal'' by Jacob Weisberg, associate editor of The New Republic (Op-Ed, Dec. 12) depicted how the 101st Congress ''was preoccupied with gestural, symbolic issues,'' while ''issues of substance commanded far more fleeting interest.''
Believing that ''scandal was the year's distinguishing feature,'' Mr. Weisberg concluded that ''historians may reflect upon 1990 as the year democracy emerged in Eastern Europe and was made a mockery on its front porch.''
Unfortunately, the depredations of 1989 were merely a continuation of the decadeslong decline of the American democratic system, although somewhat augmented by new Congressional schemes that enhance re-election security, such as the ''automatic mechanism'' under which individual voting was avoided in closing Army bases and passing the huge Congressional pay increase.
A root cause for Congressional ineffectiveness is that the exercise of good governmental judgment can in no way compete with re-election pressures. This significant imbalance and resulting ineffectiveness has been largely hidden from view because of the outstanding power of the United States economy. But as the economy slows or declines, do we not need to re-examine the procedural trap into which our representative system has fallen? 
Fortunately, perestroika for our governmental system is far simpler than that which is about to face the countries of Eastern Europe. There, to retreat from their government-owned economies, and one-party governments, they must deal with the vast bureaucracies that have been controlling each system.
For the United States to remove the overpowering lure of re-election, we need only eliminate the lure by phasing in single terms of five or six years for elected officials.
A generous bonus to retiring members of Congress would be enormously cost-effective. Incumbent officeholders have accumulated so many advantages unto themselves -fund raising for their extremely expensive election campaigns, very extensive public relations for personal recognition, a preponderant share of legislative proposals directed toward specialized voter approval - that the incumbent has an overwhelming advantage. But the public cost of their legislative enactments is also overwhelming.
In the New York City Council all the incumbents were recently re-elected, and three-quarters were not even opposed. The Congressional situation is not too different. A list of the duration of Congressional terms in office - some 30 and 40 years -would undoubtedly show many that held their consecutively elected positions longer than some of the crowned heads of Europe.
Is there an advantage to the nation from lengthy political office holding because of the incumbent's increased knowledge or skill? Unfortunately, the increased knowledge and skill is restricted primarily to re-election techniques and, to a greater extent, against the public interest, rather than for it. So much governmental expenditure is pressured by the re-election fervor that the real Federal deficit cannot be closed and the Federal debt will continue to skyrocket.
If the President of the United States can be limited to a maximum service of eight years, there is no reason members of Congress and local government elected officials cannot be limited to one term, except for longstanding custom. In response to the criticism of ''lame duck'' officeholders, any review of the past would show that a lame duck is better than a sitting bull.
At the formation of the Republic, discussions centered on well-meaning, competent people who would give up what they were doing for a time to go into government and then return to their regular occupations. The present political arrangement badly subordinates the better judgment of the officeholder to preoccupation with re-election.
In his inaugural address, Lincoln complimented the American people who ''have wisely given their public servants but little power for mischief, and have with equal wisdom provided for the return of that little to their own hands at very short intervals.''
As the Federal debt rises above $3 trillion (and soaring), powered by Congressional career ambitions, the return of this misdirected power is overdue.

HEADLINE: Marshall Plan Was in the Spring '47 Air

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In ''Who Really Deserves Marshall Plan Credit'' (letter, Dec. 3), Reed Irvine modifies James Reston's attribution of the European assistance plan's origin to Dean Acheson by calling attention to Acheson's own account of his contribution. Mr. Irvine makes a valid point but could have said more.
The need for a new start and a massive program of aid to European economic recovery in the spring of 1947 was widely recognized. As I wrote in a 1948 Department of State memorandum, the notion was shared not only in the upper echelons of the department, with Dean Acheson in a leading role, but also in the lower ranks of the department, at the Council of Foreign Relations in New York, in the press, especially in the columns of Walter Lippmann, and in a number of committees of Congress (''Memorandum for the Files: The Origins of the Marshall Plan,'' Department of State, Foreign Relations of the United States, 1947, Volume III, Government Printing Office, 1972, pages 241-247). 
The contribution of Acheson, in addition to his Cleveland, Miss., speech of May 7, 1947, was especially notable in recruiting the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Arthur Vandenberg of Michigan, to join the effort. I find it curious that Mr. Reston omitted the role of Walter Lippmann, whose biographer Ronald Steel credits him with origination of the idea in ''Walter Lippmann and the American Century'' (1980), since Mr. Steel notes that Mr. Reston and Lippmann were in close touch at the time.
The speech by Secretary of State George C. Marshall, as Mr. Irvine writes, was crafted by taking easily recognizable paragraphs from memorandums by George F. Kennan, chairman of the policy planning staff at the time, and Will Clayton, who was Under Secretary for Economic Affairs. The work of drafting them into a single speech, however, was done by Charles E. Bohlen, the Department of State Counselor, according to his 1984 autobiography, ''A Witness to History.''

Happy Soft Landings

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

 BODY:
HOW SOFT A LANDING?'' headlines the latest newsletter of economic commentary from the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland.
Last summer, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, Robert T. Parry, told a luncheon group that balanced growth ''enhances the prospect that we can achieve a soft landing,'' which he defined as ''a needed slowdown without a recession. . . . The goal is to have the economy grow at a slow rate relative to its potential to cause the rate of inflation to come down.''
Evidently Fed officials find this metaphor useful, and when the Fed offers a trope, economists and business writers haul in the line. ''Most economists expect the Fed to ease rates late in the fourth quarter,'' wrote a Reuters reporter, ''as the economy slows further from a soft landing scenario into more of a skid.'' 
Gerund economics has long been with us, as in jawboning and smooth sailing, but the gentle touchdown has become the reigning cliche. What would it be like?
''We've never had one before,'' writes Caroline A. Baum, a Treasury market commentator for Telerate Systems of Jersey City. ''No one knows exactly what it will feel like when we get there. And there is only the most tenuous definition of what it should be.''
That is why, says Ms. Baum, ''economists turned to a nonsocial science like aeronautics for a term that would adequately describe a maneuver designed to land the economy softly without inflicting damage on itself or its payload.''
Her etymological guess is on the mark. The Times of London, in a piece about lunar exploration, reported on March 28, 1958, that ''Next (in difficulty) would be a 'soft' (controlled) landing by an unmanned vehicle.'' The same phrase appeared that year in the Proceedings of the Lunar and Planetary Exploration Colloquium: ''With a soft landing on the moon, one might put down a payload of 225 to 800 pounds. . . .''
The first use I can find of the space term in economic lingo was from Newsweek on Sept. 17, 1973: ''Even if the President succeeds in pulling in the rampaging economy for a soft landing, of course, the arrival will be nonetheless bumpy for many.''
Now the metaphor is extended into many fields. A commodities dealer in 1985 said he wanted ''to organize a soft landing for tin.'' An Israeli scientist announced recently that ''We have provided a soft landing for a certain number of immigrants.'' A wine critic for The Financial Times complained that some Italian wines ''are sparkling and too gassy for my taste'' and hoped ''to arrange a soft landing back into real wine at some point.''
Soft landing is from astronautics; its opposite, crash landing, along with the toast happy landings, is from aeronautics. If the economy does achieve a level of steady, slow growth that lowers inflation while maintainingJU employment, we can expect space-minded economists to ask: ''When do we blast off again?''
 
ACRONYM WATCH
ALL YOU DINKS KNOW what Bogsat is - ''Bunch of Guys Sitting Around a Table'' - but are you familiar with Wysiwyg and Nimby? That's ''What You See Is What You Get'' and ''Not In My Back Yard.'' (When an acronym contains more than three letters, the word is not usually written in all capitals.) Some acronyms lead to the creation of usable words. In Britain, a sluppy is a combination of Sloane Ranger, a well-dressed denizen of Sloane Square, and yuppie, based on ''young urban professional.''
The aforementioned Dink, from ''Double Income, No Kids,'' has been in use for a couple of years now, its coinage attributed to Ellen Farley of Donnelley Marketing, who says that Dinks make up 7.4 million United States households. (Much of the aging part of the segment is called Woop - ''Well-Off Older People.'') In spookspeak, Snies, pronounced ''sneeze,'' from Special National Intelligence Estimates, seems to be more than a nonce term. Acronymic conversation at the Central Intelligence Agency:
''Does the President want Snies on these?'' ''Nimby.'' Wimp is not an acronym; the slang term, which has aggressively shoved aside the Yiddishism nebbish, is based on the verb whimper. However, it lends itself to doubleplaying, and to this year's best use of a slang term for acronymic coinage by the scientific community:
You physicists all know that the standard theory for the creation of large structures in the universe is Cold Dark Matter (C.D.M. for short; because the initials do not form a pronounceable word, it's not an acronym).
The theory assumes that a certain fundamental particle in nature has no other force or energy except gravity. ''These theoretical particles,'' writes John Noble Wilford in The New York Times, ''are called WIMP's, for weakly interactive massive particles.''
 
'IS CONCERNED' IS CONCERNED
''I KNOW THAT I AM shouting into the breeze here, as far as what we're doing now,'' said former Secretary of State George P. Shultz to Stanford alumni about drug legalization, ''but I feel that. . . .''
George Carlin, the comedian and language student, clipped that item and sent it in with this comment: ''Leaving aside for the moment the rest of the Secretary's language, I call your attention to a sin of omission which [sic] I have encountered more and more frequently in recent months: the dropping of the words 'is concerned' from the phrase 'as far as - is concerned.' ''
You're right, George (Carlin, not Shultz). I have been keeping a dossier on this. My Times colleague Maureen Dowd (who slipped the old dialect word tetchy into a recent story, which was wisely not changed to touchy by copy editors) wrote last year about candidate Bush: ''The Vice President said there was a double standard in the way Republicans and Democrats were viewed as far as class.''
A reader, Ian Graham of Harvard's Peabody Museum, called her to task for leaving out ''is concerned.''
Is the phrase as far as turning into a preposition meaning as for? Richard Nixon was quoted as saying about former Israeli President Golda Meir, ''Now, as far as Mrs. Meir - here's the essence of what happened.'' Jimmy Carter did the same thing: ''As far as any investigation of members of Congress, however, I am not familiar with that at all.''
But it would be wrong. As for and as to are good, short substitutes for as far as . . . is concerned, but the use of half of the last expression is not the same. The fact that all three begin with as does not make the two prepositions the same as the subordinating conjunction; all the more reason to stay alert to the easy confusion.
I know not what course others may take (wrote St. George Tucker to the biographer William Wirt, attributing to Patrick Henry the construction that later became famous), but as for me - or as far as I am concerned - give me is concerned or stop giving me as far as.

WHAT KIND OF LIFE
The Limits of Medical Progress.
By Daniel Callahan.
318 pp. New York: Simon & Schuster. $19.95.
THESE are the best of times for American health care; they are also the worst of times. Most of us will live to attain the biblical threescore and ten; many of us will avoid the pain and incapacity that would have beset the long-lived a century ago. Medicine's technological capacity has never been more impressive, and our society has shown itself willing to pay ever increasing amounts for the promise of health and long life. No other industrialized society allocates so much of its gross national product to health. Yet we Americans feel cheated, dissatisfied with many aspects of a system that has promised so much. Certainly we are unwilling, and perhaps we are unable, to bear its ever more burdensome cost. There is a broad consensus that something should and must be changed. 
With this consensus has come a steadily intensifying debate. And no voice has been more eloquent in this discussion than that of Daniel Callahan. His controversial book of 1987, ''Setting Limits: Medical Goals in an Aging Society,'' suggested that we look critically at the economic costs and the diminished quality of the lives of those who were being sustained by medicine's life-extending tools. The limits built into the human body, he argued, provided natural, and thus ultimately necessary, policy limits. Not everything that might be done should be done.
Mr. Callahan's new book, ''What Kind of Life,'' builds on these themes and presents them in a more systematic and inclusive form. The problem with our health care system, Mr. Callahan argues, lies ultimately in the realm of values, not in the realm of economics or management. We have become the victims of our own goals and achievements - victims of our faith in medicine as ever progressive technology, of our political attachment to individual choice and, finally, of our unwillingness to set limits. As long as these values pervade our culture and define our expectations, he argues, no amount of bureaucratic manipulation or procedural cost-cutting will bring lasting or meaningful reform. Such meliorist measures, without a change of values, can provide no more than temporary, symptomatic relief. Mr. Callahan's is a fundamentally cultural and, in a sense, moral view. Budget debates, he believes, are not simply arenas for negotiating interests, but occasions for articulating widely accepted values.
He advocates a rather different configuration of values as a prerequisite to a more rational and humane health care system. We must, he says, accept the reality of disease and the immanence of death in every human body; medicine cannot ultimately master nature. Moreover, we Americans must learn to see health as a communal good, not an individual good, for social choices affect us all. By keeping people alive on respirators while allowing education and preventive medicine to stagnate, we are deciding, whether consciously or not, what kind of society we will have.
Mr. Callahan's position points toward a number of practical conclusions. First, he argues that centralized planning and control are indispensable to reform. And second, he advocates a set of categorical rules that would define limits in particular clinical interactions - for instance, a rule that would deny renal dialysis or organ transplants to patients above a certain age. Inevitably such policies would mean the acceptance of scarcity and - though we might not want to call it that - rationing. Mr. Callahan even provides a specific set of priorities to order debate and policy making. Our top priorities, he says, should be preventive medicine and the needs of groups at particular risk - for instance, prenatal care for the poor - while our lowest priority should be high-cost interventions in marginal cases - say, 18-ounce babies ''or ninety-five-year-old patients suffering from multi-organ failure, or the quadriplegic teenage victims of auto accidents.'' Every American should have the right to humane care, not cure.
Most of these ideas would find widespread approval in health planning circles and, in fact, they already have. But Mr. Callahan writes for a much broader audience and does so with elegance and lucidity; he excels at describing present irrationalities and in underscoring the benefits anticipated in his new model health care system. This book will be a much discussed and influential contribution to an already vigorous debate.
But it is not without flaws. Perhaps most significant is the author's unwillingness to engage with our political system. He urges us to seek a collective good that transcends the interest-defined politics that normally and incrementally forge policy. Unfortunately, his book does not tell us how we are to achieve this laudable goal. Defining a common good is a political as well as a moral and cognitive problem. To draft a blueprint for reform, one must focus on the process by which values are articulated into specific interests and how they are perceived by individuals in their various social positions.
Our contemporary sense of crisis has, in fact, emerged not from rational discussion of an ideal medical system but from the contradictions deeply embedded within our present system. Even as people admire life-extending technologies, for instance, they voice their fears of the very same technologies and complain of spiraling costs. Moreover, expectations and policy decisions create interests, de facto political realities. When Medicare was established in 1965, it created a powerful political force - a bloc of morally entitled and economically interested voters. Similarly, when employers began routinely paying for health insurance in the 1940's and 1950's, they unwittingly contributed to the current economic crisis in health care and thus to the growing corporate advocacy for some national health insurance scheme.
No analysis that skirts these concrete issues can provide a compelling plan for social action. Mr. Callahan is effective in telling us where we should go, but not in providing a road map pointing out the most effective route. In the absence of such analysis, he asks us, in effect, to simply say no to our culture's faith in progress, to its worship of individual choice and to its habitual unwillingness to accept limits.
Mr. Callahan's cultural view raises another difficulty. If our values are as deeply embedded as he thinks, then the possibility for social reform seems limited. Mr. Callahan's emphasis on the primacy of values fits uneasily in a book that advocates rapid social change. Fundamental values are just that: fundamental, whether they relate to political choice or medicine. Many of Mr. Callahan's criticisms have been made for at least a half-century by socially minded physicians and prescient planners, but they have had little effect in moderating the trend toward an ever more costly, inhumane, and disproportionate emphasis on acute and intrusive care.
Nonetheless, these are the criticisms of a reader in general sympathy with Mr. Callahan's goals. Our health care system will certainly change during the coming generation, and, I hope, in many of the directions so passionately advocated in this book.
 
DRAWING THE LINE
Daniel Callahan, the author of ''What Kind of Life: The Limits of Medical Progress,'' describes himself freely as a philosopher - but one whose attentions tend toward the practical.
''Toward the end of the 1960's I got very interested in medical ethics - an area that was developing very rapidly and presenting our society with some historic problems,'' Mr. Callahan said, explaining his preoccupation with medicine and society in a telephone interview from Denver, where he was delivering a lecture.
In 1969 Mr. Callahan was a founder of the Hastings Center, a research institute whose role, he said, is to ''systematically explore questions of medical ethics.'' He relishes debate - something his new book, which questions ''moral assumptions'' built into our health care system, is likely to generate in quantity.
To those who would label meanspirited his book's argument for limiting society's support of more and ever more medical care, Mr. Callahan has a ready response.
''In many cities in this country we have wonderfully equipped neonatal intensive care units right down the street from terribly equipped schools,'' he said. ''We have to examine how money might be spent for the greater number of people.''
Mr. Callahan is acutely aware - and seemingly untroubled - that he will come under attack for advocating such positions as an arbitrary cut-off weight of 500 grams (slightly less than 18 ounces) below which, he believes, hospitals should not make costly and uncertain attempts to save newborn babies.
''Does it make sense,'' he asked, ''to devote such a tremendous quantity of resources to saving smaller and smaller babies, and then thrust them into a society that is characterized by second- and third-rate schools?''
He added: ''We have skewed things too much toward health care as opposed to housing, education and other things. Medical care cannot be allowed to trump everything else.'' - HOWARD W. FRENCH

THE FATE OF THE FOREST
Developers, Destroyers and Defenders of the Amazon.
By Susanna Hecht and Alexander Cockburn.
Illustrated. 266 pp. New York: Verso. $24.95.
FOR the past few years, much of the worldwide debate about global warming has centered on the devastation of the tropical forest of the Amazon. Already 10 percent of the forest has been destroyed, and its burning is now responsible for 10 percent of the world's carbon dioxide production. ''The Fate of the Forest'' is a journey into this devastation, the most senseless ecological disaster of our time. Written by Susanna Hecht, a botanist and ecologist at the University of California, Los Angeles, who has lived in the Amazon, and Alexander Cockburn, a British journalist who has been hailed by The Times Literary Supplement of London as ''probably the most gifted polemicist writing in English today,'' the book is not just about the forest itself but also about the greed of its destroyers and the fierce struggle of its supporters. 
To their credit, Ms. Hecht and Mr. Cockburn do not share the romantic and pastoral view held by the sort of ecological groups that defend trees more ardently than the human beings who starve under them. Nor do they take the paternalistic stand of the industrialized nations that, having burned their own forests, now think Brazil incapable of caring for the Amazon without some kind of international tutelage. ''The forest's fate,'' write the authors, ''will depend on the vision and the political sagacity of the people who live in it.''
Without a doubt ''The Fate of the Forest'' is ambitious. It begins with the history of the Amazon - told with a few exaggerations - and includes a full and rather boring chapter on the intricate geography of the region. Then it offers a balanced description of the mechanism by which the delicate ecological equilibrium of the forest is being undone.
''The Fate of the Forest,'' however, is primarily about the people who have left their marks on the Amazon. It leads the reader through a grandiose cast of characters - from American tycoons like Henry Ford in the 1930's and Daniel K. Ludwig in the 70's and 80's, who saw their expensive projects buried by the forest, to more modest actors such as the rubber tappers' union leader Chico Mendes, who lost his life a year ago while fighting the economic exploitation of the region and its people.
Rightly, Ms. Hecht and Mr. Cockburn take straight aim at the culpable - the Brazilian elite. But in launching most of their attacks at the Brazilian military rather than the business elite, Ms. Hecht and Mr. Cockburn miss the mark. In Brazilian history, the destruction of the Amazon has gone on regardless of whether the military has been in power or not.
The authors argue that the devastation of the tropical forest is a direct consequence of a geopolitical vision conceived by the Brazilian military - more specifically, by Gen. Golbery do Couto e Silva, who was the power behind three of the five generals who ruled Brazil from 1964 to 1985. It's true that the military did authorize depredations in the area. But the real force behind the destruction was and is found in the Brazilian business community, particularly the sector involved in the development of cattle ranching.
In an effort to make connections that justify their scenario, Ms. Hecht and Mr. Cockburn practice what could be called ''orthopedic journalism'' - forcing facts into postures that suit their theories. For instance, the devastation of the Amazon forest, contrary to the authors' theory, continued after the military left power in 1985, so Ms. Hecht and Mr. Cockburn conveniently define the civilian government of President Jose Sarney as a ''nominal democracy,'' implying that it is a mere embellishment of the military. Wrong. Mr. Sarney's presidency is corrupt and incompetent, true. But it also represents the longest period of public liberties in Brazilian history.
The authors also play fast and loose with the life of General Golbery, who lost his position in the Government in 1981. Golbery opposed some of the madder schemes for the Amazon, including the construction of a road, called the Perimetral Norte, that would have led nowhere. Since then, a derivative of this corrupt project, called the Calha Norte, has been started, and the authors contend wrongly that the General's ''shadow hangs over'' it. Golbery liked being perceived as a mysterious figure, and things were attributed to him whether he did them or not. But the authors of ''The Fate of the Forest'' have embroidered his biography a bit too much. He never fought in World War II - in either France or Italy - as they would have it, and when he actually landed in Naples the war was over.
Other statements in the book are exaggerated or superficial, and still others lack adequate documentation. One cannot say that in 1492 there were 6 million to 12 million Indians living in the Amazon basin, or that ''it is likely'' that the figure may have been as high as 15 million, when a book cited in the bibliography refers to only five million Indians. Mistakes permeate all four centuries covered by the book. Even the current United States Ambassador to Brasilia, Richard Melton, is wrongly called Richard Murphy.
Some errors in ''The Fate of the Forest'' derive from poor investigative reporting. Nonetheless, the authors are not intellectually dishonest. At a time when the international press and television praise Chico Mendes as a kind of Albert Schweitzer of the tropical forest, Ms. Hecht and Mr. Cockburn make it clear that his career as an environmentalist ''cannot be divorced from his active life as an extremely radical political militant.'' I suspect that the Hollywood producers who are now scurrying to turn Mendes's life into a multimillion-dollar script might feel uncomfortable when they learn about his past allegiance to the Communist Party of Brazil - an organization aligned ideologically with Stalinist Albania.
Unfortunately, ''The Fate of the Forest'' resembles some trees of the dying forest. It is impressive and colorful, but the roots are planted in barren soil.

A SUMMER WORLD
The Attempt to Build a Jewish Eden in the Catskills, From the Days of the Ghetto to the Rise and Decline of the Borscht Belt.
By Stefan Kanfer.
Illustrated. 333 pp. New York:
Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $22.95.
COMICS used to describe Route 17, which took Jewish vacationers to the Catskills resorts, as starting on Manhattan's Lower East Side and ending in the mountains. In his well-researched and highly readable history of the Borscht Belt, ''A Summer World,'' Stefan Kanfer traces Route 17 even further. For him, the highway started more than two centuries ago in Europe before reaching the Lower East Side. 
Mr. Kanfer, a contributing editor at Time magazine, notes that the first record of a Jew in the Catskills is a 1773 reference to ''Jacob the Jew,'' an early settler among the Dutch burghers. He follows the glories of the area through its heyday to what he calls its decline.
The major factors in the creation of the Catskills as a summer resort were the unrestricted waves of immigration from Germany, Russia and Poland in the 19th century. America was the destination for five million Jews, many of whom settled on the Lower East Side while longing for relief from the squalor both in their homes and in the sweatshops where they toiled.
Some managed to escape to the mountains, where they bought small farms. But farming was not their forte, and soon the farms became boarding houses, then inns and bungalow colonies for visitors from the city.
The guests, however, insisted on entertainment from the Catskills bonifaces, and by the 1920's, Mr. Kanfer shows, what started as an extra added attraction had become a major undertaking. Waiters and busboys were pressed into service as tummlers (the comedians and would-be comedians who were so important to the emergence of a Catskills brand of comedy), while the social directors became impresarios. Waitresses were transformed into script girls who went to Broadway shows and copied the routines of leading comics (and sometimes full plays), which were later presented in shorter form by the staffers. Mr. Kanfer explains that the practice ultimately had to be stopped when one stenographer was caught transcribing an entire edition of George White's Scandals.
Among the social directors were Moss Hart, the future playwright, and Don Hartman, soon to be head of Paramount Pictures. The tummlers came in with names such as David Daniel Kaminsky, Aaron Chwatt, Jacob Pincus Perelmuth, Morris Miller, Eugene Klass, Joseph Levitch, Milton Berlinger, Joseph Gottlieb and Murray Janofsky, and emerged as Danny Kaye, Red Buttons, Jan Peerce, Robert Merrill, Gene Barry, Jerry Lewis, Milton Berle, Joey Bishop and Jan Murray.
The comedian Joey Adams, who wrote a book on the Borscht Belt, is frequently mentioned in ''A Summer World,'' but Mr. Kanfer does not tell Mr. Adams's story of his own name change. Some years after getting his start in the mountains, he confessed to having been born Abramowitz and changing his name to Adams when he went into show business. While on a club date in Boston he was approached by Wendell Adams, a member of the fine old New England family, who jokingly inquired if they might be related. ''I don't know,'' Joey replied. ''What was your name before you changed it?'' The queen of the mountains was the soft-spoken and regal Jennie Grossinger, and she is featured throughout Mr. Kanfer's book. Her parents, Selig and Malke Grossinger, had purchased a small plot of land before World War I with a down payment of $450. In the years to follow, Jennie became the region's best-known hostess, her hotel the most imitated.
One of the imitators was Arthur Winarick, the bald manufacturer of Jeris hair tonic and the owner of the Concord. After hearing that Grossinger's had an 18-hole golf course, Mr. Kanfer relates, Winarick wanted to build a 50-hole course. He ultimately contented himself with three courses, two with 18 holes and one with nine.
IN recent years, television and increased competition for vacationers have proved serious threats to the region, and recession fears hit hard when Grossinger's was sold in 1985 for conversion to condominiums and ski houses. Other hotels followed, through either Chapter 11 or direct sale, while some of those that are still in business are now places where religious cultists frolic. Still, resorts such as the Concord continue to be vacation spots, holding out hope for preservation of the area.
In telling the story of the Catskills, Mr. Kanfer has tied together history, religion and show business into an entertaining compendium. But despite his book's subtitle, he need not worry about the area's decline. The Catskills innkeepers are a resourceful group. Years ago when they were in trouble, they drummed up fall and winter weekday business with conventions and trade shows. Today, they hope that the New York State Legislature will grant them casino gambling. If the lawmakers comply, there will unquestionably be many more chapters to be written on the history of the Borscht Belt.

HEADLINE: Office Construction in the Doldrums

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
THE New York region's commercial real estate developers, whose teeming construction sites and vastly profitable office ventures became a symbol of the go-go 80's, are entering the new decade with sharply reduced plans and protracted construction schedules.
Analysts say the shift comes at time when work remains in progress on dozens of new office towers in midtown Manhattan, along New Jersey's Hudson River waterfront and elsewhere. But, they say, it will become much clearer by the end next year, when work on several Manhattan buildings will have been completed and hardly any new buildings will be breaking ground.
Elsewhere in New York City, and in northern New Jersey, Westchester and Fairfield Counties and Long Island, building activity also will trail off, but less rapidly than in Manhattan.
The slowdown is less severe than in Texas, Arizona, Florida and some other parts of the Sun Belt, where hyperactive real estate investment and a boom-and-bust economy are taking most of the blame for the nation's most expensive bailout of the thrift institutions that make development loans. So much office space is vacant in some Sun Belt cities that little new construction is expected for years. 
The experts doubt that such a serious glut will develop in the New York region because employment remains robust in most of its office-using industries and the rapid falloff in new construction will prevent overbuilding from reaching much more serious levels.
Indeed, at a time when large blocks of new space have been coming on the market, particularly in West Midtown, law firms, advertising agencies, foreign banks and other large companies have been signing on for them. Leases were signed in the this year for 24.2 million square throughout Manhattan, 3.3 more than in 1988, according to Julien J. Studley Inc., a real estate brokerage that analyzes leasing at new and old buildings alike.
The firm said more than three times the amount of office space was leased in New York City this year than in any other American city.
But the high leasing levels have not kept office vacancy rates from reaching their highest point in over a decade - nearly 14 percent, and climbing, in midtown Manhattan, 13 percent in lower Manhattan and over 20 percent in some suburbs. Many executives worry how long it will take to fill the existing buildings and all but dismiss the need for more construction soon.
A Japanese company that has already provided $200 million in construction financing for a half-complete 50-story Manhattan office tower petitioned the courts in mid-December to force the project into bankruptcy. The building, Americas Tower, on Avenue of the Americas between 45th and 46th Streets, is one of more than a half-dozen new midtown office buildings whose developers are engaged in a bruising competition for large corporate tenants. Although the court denied the petition of the Japanese company, KG Land New York Corporation, its partner, New York Land Company, said it had solicited bids for a new partner or source of financing.
And while it is worrying some New York City developers, uncertainty over office demand is causing even more concern in the suburbs. In another December court action, the Resolution Trust Corporation, the Federal agency formed in August to oversee thrifts taken over in the Government's rescue program, seized City Federal Savings Bank, New Jersey's largest savings institution.
City Federal is the second-largest lender taken over, behind Gibraltar Savings of Los Angeles. The bank said its problems were largely confined to nonperforming construction loans made to builders of condominiums and other residential properties in New Jersey, Florida and Texas, but its portfolio also included some loans to commercial developers in New Jersey who, although current in their accounts, were experiencing extreme difficulting attracting tenants.
''THE problems in the suburbs are much worse than in the city,'' said Rosemary Scanlon, chief economist for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which monitors economic conditions throughout the New York region.
She said the difficulties of suburban developers are particularly severe because most started work on office projects on speculation. Now, she added, with a surplus of space, the problem is aggravated by an acute shortage of workers that is discouraging companies from moving to the new offices.
In a region that has gone through sharp, unpredictable economic swings, sometimes leaving it with shortages of office space in periods of sudden expansion, experts offer little consensus about how steep the current decline will be or how long it will last. Some warn of deep trouble.
''The picture is frightening,'' said James P. Stuckey, president of New York City's Public Development Corporation since 1985, who leaves office with the inauguration of David Dinkins as Mayor next week. He added that the midtown vacancy rate could go above 20 percent - its highest level in memory - if all the corporate tenants known to be planning to leave the neighborhood do so and few new tenants are signed on over the next year.
Real estate executives maintain that the problem lies less in a spurt of new construction than in broader regional economic shifts.
For more than a decade, office-using industries have led the region's economic expansion. Dozens of corporations moved their headquarters to campuslike suburban installations in the 70's, banks and securities firms had a voracious demand for offices near Wall Street in the early 80's and advertising firms, entertainment companies and law firms have more recently beaten a broad path to midtown Manhattan.
But now, with deep and continuing employment cuts at Manhattan's banks and securities firms, hostile takeovers and management restructuring programs that have eroded employment in the suburban corporate centers and generally bleak forecasts of economic growth in the region, few corporate pace setters are in view.
''The region's economy is changing and nobody knows how it is going to turn out,'' said Richard Rosan, senior vice president for new development of Silverstein Properties, a major commerical developer in New York City and New Jersey. ''We just can't see where the growth is coming.''
In one analysis, the Edward S. Gordon Company, a brokerage, found that midtown construction will decline sharply in the next 18 months. It forecast that only one 225,000-square-foot office building, less than a quarter the size of many of the city's office towers, will be completed in the midtown market in 1991.
That level of completions would be the lowest since 1960, the first year in the brokerage's study. In contrast, the company said, eight midtown office buildings will be completed in 1990, seven were completed in 1989 and six were completed in 1988, adding at least 3.5 million square feet of new midtown space in each of those years.
Office construction in lower Manhattan is, for the moment, a dead issue, according to the brokerage. It said that no new office buildings were completed this year and that none would be in 1990 or 1991. In the mid-80's, the study showed, an annual average of over 3 million square feet was added on Wall Street and elsewhere in lower Manhattan.
Suburban construction is slowing, but far from coming to a halt. An analysis by Cushman & Wakefield, the national real estate brokerage, found that 5.7 million square feet of office space was completed this year in the corporate centers of northern New Jersey, including the Hudson River waterfront, Morris County, along Route I-78 and elsewhere in the northern third of the state. That was slightly more than half the amount added in 1988, and the concern said even fewer new offices are now under construction.
On Long Island, it said 1.1 million square feet was added this year, half the amount of 1988, but it said that 2.1 million square feet is now under construction. In Fairfield County, Conn., it said, 1.6 million square feet was completed this year, down from 2 million in 1988, and only 695,000 square feet of new space is under construction.
The study found a more dramatic slowdown in Westchester County, where only 342,000 square feet was completed this year, compared to 1.8 million in 1988. It said 619,000 square feet is now under construction.
Experts say the reduced levels of construction are a result of an economic cycle that brought rapid job growth and expanding space needs for most of the last decade but has left the entire New York region bracing for little overall growth in the early 90's, and employment cuts in some industries.
One that is likely to weather the downturn with few job losses is the construction industry itself, which is in high demand in huge, long-term projects to rebuild the region's roads, bridges, airports and mass-transit systems. Billions of dollars have been budgeted for the work by New York City, the states, the Port Authority and other agencies.
Samuel H. Ehrenhalt, New York Regional Commission of the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, said 162,000 are currently employed in construction jobs in the region, a 3 percent increase over 1988. The number of construction workers has increased gradually in each year since 1984, the Federal agency said.
NOR are the region's developers and commercial landlords without large, highly profitable corporate tenants to court. Some of the towers completed over the last two years have been quickly filled.
''I am not at all pessimistic,'' said William Zeckendorf Jr., one of New York City's most active developers, who this year completed Worldwide Plaza, a complex of offices, condominiums and retail space that covers a midtown Manhattan block bounded by Eighth and Ninth Avenues and 49th and 50th Streets.
Although many of Mr. Zeckendorf's condominiums remain unsold, the office space in the complex is more than 90 percent leased, with the biggest amounts occupied by Cravath, Swaine & Moore, a law firm, and Ogilvy & Mather and NW Ayer, both advertising agencies, which took partial equity in the complex and signed on long before it was complete. Many large corporations seeking new space because their leases are coming up for renewal and they need more modern quarters for their computers remain in the market, he added.
Another developer, Lewis Rudin, has leased out 30 floors at 1675 Broadway, a 35-story office building he completed at Broadway and 52d Street this year. He said several tenants have expressed interest in floors that remain vacant. ''We've been so successful it's dull,'' he said.
And along the Hudson River waterfront in Jersey City, the Limited Ltd., a national retailer, has signed on for nearly a third of the space in the Newport Office Tower, a 1.1 million-square-foot building being put up by Melvin Simon Associations, an Indianapolis developer, in the Newport complex of apartments, offices and a shopping mall. The building is expected to be completed in the fall of 1991.
Elsewhere in the real estate industry, executives are abuzz with conjecture that several companies will commit themselves to large new blocks of space soon.
Chemical Bank, which earlier in the year withdrew from negotiations to move its headquarters to one of the office towers planned in the redevelopment of Times Square, is widely reported to be considering moving part of its operations to the Meadowlands area of New Jersey or one of the new office towers in midtown, while also negotiating a new lease at its current headquarters at 277 Park Avenue, at 48th Street.
The News America Corporation, the publishing company controlled by Rupert Murdoch, is rumored to be negotiating for a large complex of offices at 1575 Broadway, a new office tower just off 47th Street.
And the Sony Corporation, the Japanese conglomerate that over the last two years acquired Columbia Pictures and CBS Records, is thought to be considering consolidating its New York operations at the Americas Tower. Real estate executives said privately last week that they would not be surprised if Sony replaced KG Land in extending financing for the project, while taking space in the building as well.
In all, industry experts said, that large blocks of offices, totaling 5 million square feet, are being sought by corporate tenants in New York City and are likely to be leased in the first three months of 1990.
''There is a lot of leasing going on and a lot of people still in the market,'' said Raymond O'Keefe, senior vice president of Cushman & Wakefield.
STILL, experts said a surge in leasing activity would have been expected even in a period of economic strain because of the vast amount of new space built in the last three years. Most of the Manhattan construction was prompted by city incentives, extended to developers who laid their foundations in West Midtown by May 1988, that permitted buildings larger than would otherwise have been allowed.
A result, some say, will be little more than a high-stakes game of musical chairs in which several large corporations move to new offices but leave large vacancies behind.
''There are diminishing expectations all over the place,'' said Maurice Solomon, manager of the midtown office of Julien J. Studley. To attract tenants, he said, developers have been offering incentives that would not have been considered in the mid-80's, including six-month rent abatements and large packages of interior improvements tailored to the needs of individual office users.
And while bleak economic forecasts are making the developers less ambitious, well-organized community resistance to large-scale development is slowing the process, particularly in New York City. Major, widely publicized projects that have been planned for years remain blocked by litigation.
One is Columbus Center, a proposed complex of offices, condominiums and stores on the Columbus Circle site now occupied by the New York Coliseum. Its developer, Boston Properties, which has faced vocal community opposition and several suits since it was selected for the project in 1985, has gone through three alterations of its plan, finally winning the endorsement of some its most powerful opponents - including Mayor-elect Dinkins and Manhattan Borough President-elect Ruth Messinger - in late 1988.
But fresh suits filed in September say the project would violate air-quality standards, and those actions are pending.
Morri Berman, the attorney for Boston Properties, owned by Mortimer Zuckerman, the publisher of U.S. News and World Report, said the developer expects the project to go forward. But he declined to predict when the legal challenges would be resolved other than to say the developer hoped to break ground before the end of 1990.
The delay of Columbus Center is a sensitive matter at City Hall because the site is to be sold by the city, with the proceeds used for subway improvements and to pay other city bills. The administration of Mayor Edward I. Koch had planned to budget $247 million of the proceeds for the current fiscal year.
Another long-delayed commercial venture that is critically important at City Hall is the proposed redevelopment of Times Square, first planned in 1983. The project is to include four office towers of 32 to 57 stories, a hotel, a merchandise market and the renovation of historic 42d Street theaters that are now pornographic and action movie houses.
Dozens of suits have been filed to block the project, which can proceed only if New York State's Urban Development Corporation condemns existing Times Square properties. Many of the suits contend that businesses would be improperly displaced, the planned office towers are too large and bulky and the developer, a partnership of George Klein, a large New York City builder, and the Prudential Insurance Company of America, had been given unnecessarily lucrative financial incentives to build in an area that would eventually be redeveloped anyway.
A redesigned plan for the office towers was released by the developrs in August. Since then, state officials said, all the suits that had been on appeal have been thrown out of court or withdrawn. But two new suits have been filed, which could delay condemnation and redevelopment further.
Larry Joseph, a spokesman for the Urban Development Corporation, said that the agency's lawyers hope the remaining litigation will be resolved by March and that condemnation and demolition of the existing Times Square buildings will begin by the end of 1990.

HEADLINE: Stewart Looks Past Oakland's Shadows

BYLINE: By MICHAEL MARTINEZ

DATELINE: OAKLAND, Calif.

 BODY:
THE day is still not over, but shadows and the temperature have begun to fall quickly as Dave Stewart drives slowly down Center Street, turns left onto 15th and then finally pulls to a stop at Cypress Avenue. There are old, tired houses to his right and to his left, a barricade of yellow police tape in front of him and then a strange wide expanse of leveled earth beyond that, as if a bulldozer had suddenly pushed everything aside.
Stewart surveys all of this, points toward a winding piece of concrete that looks like part of a freeway on-ramp and then shakes his head.
''It's all gone,'' he said in the cool afternoon air. ''The whole thing. Gone.'' 
For nearly two miles stretching east, there is little but rubble where the two-tiered Interstate 880 once stood. But staring down at him, its shadow growing longer as the sun drops, is the only thing remaining: a massive slab of the fallen freeway resting limply against an upright section of the structure, a reminder of what used to be and what had happened to change it.
More than two months have passed since the Oct. 17 earthquake rattled northern California and sent the World Series into a 10-day holding pattern. But the memories are still strong for those who live in the Bay Area, including Stewart, the Oakland Athletics pitcher.
In baseball history, Stewart will always be recalled as the pivotal performer in the A's four-game sweep of the San Francisco Giants, the winner of the first and fourth games and the most valuable player of the Series. In reality, he was one of the players affected most by the quake's resounding destruction, his nights spent driving to the Cypress structure to watch rescuers pull bodies from the rubble.
Stewart still does not know what caused him to lay awake, then inexplicably visit the freeway site in the nights that followed the tremor. But he knows that it was his city that buckled, that few could feel the sense of loss and concern that he did.
''I'm born here; I'm raised here,'' he said one day last week. ''That's the difference. I wouldn't expect a player born in Mobile, Ala., and playing in Oakland to care as much as I do. Part of my character comes from this city. It's my roots.''
So as Oakland continues to rebuild, Stewart watches with special interest. He points to buildings ruined by the earthquake but also drives through areas that signal a rejuvenation of the city of more than 300,000: Jack London Square, the downtown area along Broadway, and old Oakland, where Victorian houses are being carefully restored.
The double-decker 880 freeway was a part of Oakland, too, carrying commuters north and south in almost constant congestion. Stewart rode it to the Oakland Coliseum in the summer's early afternoons, then rode it home at night.
''My sister was supposed to be coming to the ball game at that time,'' he said, remembering the moment the earthquake struck, 5:04 P.M. Pacific time, about a half hour before the first pitch of Game 3. ''I had no clue what happened to her because there was no phone communication. If she'd been on time, she would have been a part of that damage. But she hadn't even left the house at 5 o'clock.''
Perhaps it was his familiarity with the devastated area - the fact he drove regularly on I-880, or the fact he spent idle hours in the neighborhood as a youth - that drew Stewart to Cypress Avenue for several nights afterward.
''I still don't have the slightest idea,'' he said. ''People have told me they think it was the security of knowing that people were out there working to get others out. I don't know.''
Stewart is more certain of his need to play a role in Oakland's revival. He willingly attends business functions that go toward helping the redevelopment of the community, he serves on the board of directors for the Oakland Boys Club and he speaks on behalf of the local Just Say No campaign against drugs. Equally important, he spends one week in early January calling more than a dozen schools throughout the Bay Area and addressing the drug problem with students.
Stewart, who is 32 years old, said he has become keenly aware of Oakland's problem because, in part, it contrasts his own memories as a youngster, days when there were alternatives to crime and drugs.
''You see the amount of athletes to come out of this area, and you know it's because there were a lot of recreation and park facilities,'' he said. ''Now you take it 15, 20 years later, and there aren't as many opportunities for kids to develop. I built my self-esteem on the baseball fields. They don't have that anymore, and so they look to other avenues.
''Drugs aren't new; they've been here a long time. But people see them as a way to make money, and so they start selling marijuana in high school, then go on to bigger things.''
In Stewart's mind, the best way to solve the dilemma is to bring back playgrounds, programs and positive alternatives.
In a significant way, Stewart has become Oakland's own ambassador. His pitching brings him notoriety, his community work satisfies a need to give back.
He might be the city's best-known resident, even though he spends part of the winter in the southern California town of Claremont, east of Los Angeles. In his car, motoring through the suburbs and then back into downtown, strangers recognize Stewart and honk. He always waves back. ''A lot of people identify with me,'' he said. ''Being from Oakland, the comment that's made most often by people is that they appreciate what I'm doing for the community. They know I'm trying to do something about things, not just making my money and getting out.''
About money: Stewart, despite three consecutive 20-victory seasons with the A's, suddenly ranks as a baseball pauper, his $1.075 million salary running far behind the contracts signed recently by Mark Langston, Mark Davis, Robin Yount and his own teammate Rickey Henderson.
But Stewart, who has one year remaining on his current pact, is in early negotiations with the A's on a two-year extension that could pay him $7 million.
''For me,'' he said, ''it's not a question of making more money. It's a matter of being recognized as the best. If I have to make more money than Mark Langston to be recognized as the best, then that's what I'll have to do.''
There has always seemed to be a shortage of recognition for the right-hander, who has never won the Cy Young Award and whose accomplishment in the post-season - becoming the first pitcher to go 2-0 in the league championship series and 2-0 in the World Series - was largely overlooked.
''Nobody talks about it,'' he said of his 4-0 streak, which gave him 25 victories for the season, ''but then it might be just another part of my career. I've gotten used to it.
''Yes, I've won 20 three times, but it's been my misfortune that somebody else has pitched as well or better and won the Cy Young. All I can do is pitch consistently. That's the thing people respect. Dependability. That's the best I can ask of myself.''
In Oakland, Stewart has been undeniably dependable. Now, when he looks at the streets, he sees a part of himself.
''Heck, I grew up here,'' he said. ''This city isn't any different from any other city. There's drugs and crime, and people talk about wanting to move out, but I'm not that way. It's a good place to live. It's my home.''

HEADLINE: Baseball Notebook;
Whatever the Sport, Bo Jackson Makes Contact

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
FOOTBALL, which Bo Jackson will play at Giants Stadium today, is a contact sport. So is baseball, which Jackson also plays. While Jackson has shown improvement in avoiding contact in football this year, he has displayed improvement in making contact in baseball.
Entering the Los Angeles Raiders' game against the Giants, Jackson needs 85 yards to become a 1,000-yard rusher. His 915 yards -in only 10 games - has already easily exceeded his 1988 total of 580 yards, and the total computes to a 5.6-yards-per-carry average compared with 4.3 last season. 
Playing for the Kansas City Royals, Jackson did not make contact 172 times, making him the most prolific batter at striking out in 1989. But his ratio of one strikeout every 2.99 times at bat was virtually the same as his 1988 ratio of 3.01.
In his other 343 times at bat, though, Jackson compiled a .385 average, giving him the third-best contact average in the majors among the 42 players who struck out 100 or more times. Will Clark of San Francisco had the highest contact average, .404, and Rolando Roomes of Cincinnati was just one point ahead of Jackson at .386. (To figure contact average, subtract strikeouts from times at bat and divide hits by that number; 400 times up with 100 strikeouts and 100 hits yields a .250 batting average, but a .333 contact average.) Jackson had the greatest difference between batting average (.256) and contact average (129 points). Roomes had the second greatest spread (123 points).
Jackson, a consistent 100-plus strikeout batter, has been among the top 10 hitters in contact average in each of his three full seasons. In 1987, he batted .391 when he hit the ball and last year batted .369. Both times he was seventh.
In 1987, Jack Clark had the highest contact average, .429, but last year Andres Galarraga finished at .404, the same as Will Clark this year. Galarraga and Jack Clark each produced a .355 contact average this year and tied for ninth. In between Jackson and those two were Eric Davis .376, Danny Tartabull .371, Kevin Mitchell and Howard Johnson .369, and Mickey Tettleton .361.
Not everyone who strikes out 100 or more times has a better-than-.300 contact average. Five of this year's group of 42 didn't make it to that level: Lloyd Moseby .277, Darryl Strawberry .288, Joe Carter .293, and Tom Brunansky and Cory Snyder .296.
Rob Deer of Milwaukee, who had a .210 batting average and a .318 contact average, had the worst strikeout ratio, one for every 2.95 times at bat. Jackson was next at 2.99 and was followed by Jack Clark 3.14, Roomes 3.15 and Pete Incaviglia 3.33.
Roomes, a Cincinnati outfielder, could be a strikeout force to be reckoned with. He played in only 107 games as a 27-year-old rookie this year, but his strikeout ratio was not an accident because he brought impressive credentials with him.
Roomes, who grew up in Rockaway Park, Queens, led three different minor leagues in strikeouts, including two in a row, the Eastern League and the American Association, in 1987 and '88. Furthermore, in his 10 years as a professional player, he has averaged one strikeout every 2.87 times at bat.
 
A Fuming Steinbrenner?
George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' owner, can't be pleased with the Mets' acquisition of Alejandro Pena from the Los Angeles Dodgers.
When Pena was a free agent last year, Steinbrenner wanted him badly for the Yankees' bullpen. Pena was prepared to join the Yankees until the Dodgers stunned him with a two-year, $2.15 million offer. Steinbrenner was so outraged that he stopped talking, at least temporarily, to Pena's agent, Tom Reich, with whom he always had had a solid relationship.
Now, one year later, Pena will come to New York, but not to pitch for the Yankees.
 
Cerone's Word Power
Rick Cerone, on the other hand, will come back to New York to catch for the Yankees for a third time, proving that the best way to deal with the owner is to curse at him in a roomful of people. That's what Cerone did in the Yankees' clubhouse after a game in the 1981 division playoff.
When Cerone signed up for his second term, in 1987, he started out by calling Steinbrenner to ask for an invitation to spring training, no contract necessary. But the owner gave him a $250,000 contract.
Now Cerone has a two-year, $1.4 million contract with the Yankees. It happens to be the most lucrative contract per year that he has ever had. He signed a four-year, $2.4 million contract with the Yankees before the 1983 season.
Two things to be said for Cerone: he is one of the tougher catchers in the majors and last season he had the second best runs-batted-in ratio among catchers. He drove in 48 runs in 296 times at bat, or one every 6.2. Carlton Fisk was the only one who was proportionately more productive, driving in 68 runs in 375 times at bat, or one every 5.5.
 
A Fair Chance for Samuel
When the Dodgers acquired Juan Samuel to play center field, some defensive-minded people wondered if the Dodgers had seen Samuel play center for the Mets. Fred Claire, the Los Angeles general manager, said they had, but they are confident Samuel will improve and play adequate defense.
''He's a great athlete,'' said Claire. ''He has the speed and the ability. I don't think he had a fair opportunity. We go into it thinking he can play center.''
But can the Dodgers be confident about an offensive comeback by Samuel? It has been two years since he was the catalyst the Mets expected him to be when they got him from Philadelphia. In 1988, Samuel dropped 29 points in average (.272 to .243), 16 home runs (28 to 12) and 33 runs batted in (100 to 67). This past season he continued his skid, batting .235, hitting 11 home runs and knocking in 48 runs.
 
The Bashing Continues
Poor Calvin Griffith. The former owner of the Minnesota Twins has been out of baseball for five years, but he is still being bashed for his penurious economic practices.
Some years ago, when the owners were discussing revenue sharing among the clubs, with the larger-market teams helping their smaller-market brethren, George Steinbrenner expressed his opposition by saying, ''Let me run the Twins instead of Calvin Griffith and I'll accept revenue sharing.''
More recently, the subject of revenue sharing between owners and players came up, and Donald Fehr, the players' labor leader, said: ''If you want to have revenue sharing, you can't have any more Calvin Griffiths running baseball teams because Calvin Griffith doesn't produce revenue. The players cannot be in the position of being stuck with bad management.
''We all know that some baseball teams are very good marketers and some stink. When markets set salaries, the ones that don't do so well nevertheless have to meet market standards. When you go to revenue sharing, if Calvin Griffith is running a team, not only does he depress salaries on his team but he also depresses salaries of the other 25.''

Will East German Athletes Continue to Dominate?

 BODY:
rrConsidering their small population, the East Germans have performed an athletic miracle through individual and organized effort, and that is to be lauded without cynicism. Yet, the same mind-set in their political system has caused all the discontent that has so rapidly risen to the surface this year. The control that glorifies a few hundred athletes and instills pride in the nation leaves millions more suffering politically, economically, socially, artistically, in short, in every outlet of human expression.
Capitalism is replete with disillusioning waste and excess, yet athletes and exemplars from other disciplined professions succeed in systems such as America's when their desire truly comes from within.
East Germans loosened from the reins of their state, who realize such personal inspiration, will continue to find ways to dominate on an individual basis, even with less help from Big Brother.

HEADLINE: Bethlehem Township;
Residents and Quarry Are at Loggerheads Over Blast Effects

BYLINE: By NOAM COHEN

DATELINE: BETHLEHEM TOWNSHIP

 BODY:
WHEN chunks of granite from a nearby quarry tumbled into his backyard last spring, Gus Dobes of Bethlehem Township complained to the state. Months earlier, when he and his neighbors noticed that their houses were shaking more than usual from the quarry's blasts, he signed a petition that was also sent to the state.
Now that Mr. Dobes has lost at least an acre of his backyard to a 60-foot-deep chasm that he thinks was created by unsafe mining by the owners of the Pattenburg Quarry, he has opted for a different strategy. ''I think I will have the lawyer do the talking,'' he said. For Mr. Dobes, who has lived for 20 years in the same house, which is roughly 400 feet from the quarry, the story is pretty simple: a crack in the road outside his door in late October, a blast of dynamite in the quarry in early November and then, 20 minutes later, a 250-foot-long landslide that swallowed some of his land.
Mr. Dobes's neighbor, the Pattenburg Quarry, has a different explanation. ''I think it was bad timing,'' said Michael A. Gianetti Jr., the quarry's operations manager. 
The ground above the quarry, Mr. Gianetti said, was weakened by a poorly designed drainage system, saturating the land and jeopardizing the road's structure. ''We could have stopped blasting for years, and when it fell they would have still blamed us,'' he said.
Geologists disagree about the cause of the landslide, which occurred 400 feet from the quarry through a road that winds above the outdoor mine. The quarry's engineers say a joint between two rocks gave way because of the weight of water-soaked land. Township officials say the slide is down toward the quarry, an indication, they say, that the mine blasts somehow jeopardized the structure of the rocks around the quarry.
The landslide will most likely permanently close Bellwood Farm Road, a thoroughfare in this small community, and no doubt will spawn years of costly litigation against the quarry by Mr. Dobes and the township. Lawyers for the township say they may also sue the state, which has the power to forbid blasting, for permitting the Pattenburg Quarry to continue its mining.
The landslide and the different explanations for its cause also illustrate the simmering feud between many of 3,400 residents of the township and the quarry's new owners.
The conflict dates to the time two years ago when the Gianettis bought the quarry, and when, shortly afterward, the township passed a regulation that would have all but ended stone excavation within the township.
The fact that the new owners replaced an old township family that had mined there for six decades has not made negotiations between the two sides any easier.
But more than the quarry's ownership has changed in the half century of mining in this township, which is situated in central New Jersey, just off Interstate 78 and close to the Pennsylvania border. Bethlehem, once primarily agricultural, is now also residential, increasing public exposure to the mine.
Many in the township say they are concerned by what will happen to the area once the quarry has been exhausted - 15 years from now, according to recent estimates.
In a nearby township, Bernardsville, town administrators seized on a similar change of quarry ownership to pass regulations that banned mining there. The law has been upheld by a local court and is now being appealed by the mine's owners, who contend that they have had millions of dollars in stone reserves taken from them without just cause.
''Years ago, if this had happened you would make an agreement with the farmer next door and that would be the end of it,'' said Anthony Figel, the Pattenburg Quarry's engineer. Mr. Figel said neighbors who complained about blasts from the mine were ''like people who move next to an airport and complain about the noise of the planes.''
In mid-October, people first noticed that there were two pronounced cracks in Bellwood Farm Road, prompting township officials to close the route, which had been regularly used by school buses. Neighbors immediately suspected that the quarry, an 86-acre complex just off a highway, might be to blame.
The quarry, which alone spans 40 acres, holds granite that is used to make the crushed-stone base for roadbeds. The rest of the land houses a rock-crushing machine that can pulverize up to 1,200 tons of rock a day.
After the cracks first developed, the quarry stopped blasting for a week to allow the township to test the road's safety, Mr. Figel said, although the crusher continued to operate. In that time, Mr. Figel said, the township ''didn't do anything.''
''It's almost like they sat back and waited for this to happen so they could pounce on us,'' he said.
But the township called the state and asked a team of experts from the Labor Department's Division on Mine Safety to examine the road. The state conducted its tests and determined that the road would not be imperiled if the quarry blasted within legal limits.
The next day the Township Committee passed a resolution asking the quarry to hold off blasting for a week.
At noon a day later, dynamite blasted the quarry's northwest face. Half an hour later, witnesses say, the landslide began. ''It's an amazing thing to see trees 50 feet high slip to the left,'' said Robert L. Alexander, a lawyer for the township who saw the landslide. ''It would take a fool to watch this blast take place and the landslide and not see the connection.''
The landslide's effects can be seen inside the quarry as well. Boulders weighing about 30,000 tons were dislodged by the blast, about six times more than usual, in a potentially dangerous avalanche, Mr. Gianetti said. The quarry operators say that the collapse within the quarry is evidence that the problem is based outside the quarry and that perhaps it was an abandoned mine shaft, maybe a sinkhole. In their thinking, the avalanche is damage against the quarry committed by a careless township that failed to check the safety of land where it built a road.
The quarry is under a recent court order that forbids blasting but allows the crushing, loading and transportation of rock.
Many in the town think that shutting down a road used by more than just the quarry's neighbors might be the incident they need to tightly regulate the quarry, or even shut it down.
At a town meeting about the landslide attended by about 80 people last month, resident after resident asked that tight limits be placed on the quarry. So much so that Rita Regimbal, an associate of Mr. Alexander, at one point had to urge restraint, for financial reasons. ''We don't want to just put them out of business for the sake of putting them out of business, despite what many individuals here might feel,'' said. ''We want them to only do what can be done in absolute safety.''
The quarry thinks the episode is based on an irrational fear and hatred of quarries. ''We think this whole thing is a witch hunt and a vendetta,'' Mr. Gianetti said.
The owners of the quarry fear for its own economic welfare and that of the state. ''The quarries are getting beat in this state,'' Mr. Figel said. ''If it keeps up in New Jersey, you are going to be importing stones.''
Mr. Dobes said that he planned to remain in his home, but that he feared for the future. The foundation of his house already has two cracks, he said, and he continually reassures himself that the landslide has not grown any bigger.
''I go over and look every day to see what's happening,'' he said.

'Cartoons Come to Paterson'

BYLINE: By VIVIEN RAYNOR

DATELINE: PATERSON

 BODY:
SINCE a fire in its administrative quarters last year, the Paterson Museum has been rather subdued - not that it is ever very active. This ''warehouse'' of local history in the Rogers Building, which was once an assembly plant for locomotives, is the centerpiece of the Great Falls Historic District. Yet it seems to be awaiting the arrival of the cultural renaissance that was announced way back in the 1970's.
Perhaps it was never meant to be. Paterson was founded as an industrial city, reportedly the first in the country, and it remains that, notwithstanding the departure of the silk and engineering industries that made it famous. Come 1992, it will be 200 years since the Society for Establishing Useful Manufactures decided to erect the first mills (for spinning and weaving cotton) and houses (fewer than a dozen) and harness the power of the falls. 
It was here that Samuel Colt established his first ''gun mill'' (1836), that his cousin, Christopher, started the silk industry (1839) and that John Philip Holland designed and launched, in the Passaic River, his first submarine (1878). Paterson was immortalized in the late 1950's by William Carlos Williams's giant poem of the same name, and the city, with its ramshackle wood houses and telephone poles groaning under swags of wire, has the look of a Ben Shahn painting. Nevertheless, its distant past is the more marketable today. With a collection of minerals, close to a quarter of a million photographs documenting the city's development, industrial relics and the like, the museum has the makings for educational shows and, on occasion, has used them. But low funds and perhaps low morale, too, have kept it from realizing its potential. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the art exhibitions, including the current ''Cartoons Come to Paterson.''
The curators imported for the occasion are Jose Delbo and Hy Eisman, authors of, respectively, ''The Transformers'' and ''The Katzenjammer Kids.'' Between them, they have come up with about 70 colleagues, a quarter of them born in New Jersey or living there, and twice that number of works. Some drawings are originals displayed in glass cases, but most are reproductions attached to boards under plastic.
Visitors had better be well versed in strip cartoons and the comic groups Marvel and DC; beginners, late starters and those who have lost traction in the field need not apply.
Cartoons have been the entertainment of millions for most of the 20th century, but only in the post-Pop era have they been elevated to the status of art - much to their detriment. The Museum of Cartoon Art, in Rye Brook, N.Y., is a mine of syndicated fun (it was founded by Mort Walker, whose ''Beetle Bailey'' figures in this show). But its atmosphere is that of a ''serious'' museum. Unfortunately, comics don't lend themselves to the system devised for processing high art, nor should they try, if only because the originality that is so prized in the upper strata counts for little in the cartoon world.
Most people know that ''Peanuts'' is Charles Schulz's baby and ''B.C.'' Johnny Hart's. But ''Batman'' - does he belong to Bob Kane, who invented him, or to the artists who draw him, Mr. Delbo and Tex Blaisdell among them? It is the same with ''Superman,'' who is represented here by Alex Saviuk and Bob Oksner but is the 1930's creation of Siegel and Schuster. ''Concessions'' to draw characters of this stature are awarded by the publishers, along with strict rules for drawing them.
There are personages like Conan the Barbarian, who started life as the hero of a paperback series, and Mr. Delbo's own Transformers, who were originally robot toys. This information was supplied by Mr. Delbo, not the biographies, which, written mainly by the artists themselves, tend to be irritatingly informative about wives (without whom) and children but facetiously offhand about accomplishments. As already indicated, it is a take-it-or-leave-it show.
Walt Kelly's ''Pogo'' is present; so is Andy Kubert's ''Brave and Bold.'' Virgil Partch's Surrealist man is bending over to retrieve a gun that a flirtatious woman has dropped instead of a handkerchief. A cartoonist in The New Yorker style, Don Orehek is represented by a drawing of whale watchers sighting their quarry as it spouts medical debris.
Dennis Corrigan aspires to high art with Surrealist images beautifully drawn in pencil. ''Kitty Litter'' features a car full of joy-riding cats with a tom at the wheel, discarding trash over the side. In ''Three Men Carrying a Grudge,'' the figures are dressed in 18th- , 19th- and 20th-century costumes while in their collective hands is the beetle from, seemingly, Kafka's ''Metamorphosis.''
There are children's book illustrations by Harry Devlin, notably one of figures skulking by the light of a yellow moon toward an obviously haunted house.There are also political cartoons on the order of Don Evers's, one of which shows Uncle Sam getting his outstretched hand eaten away by acid rain. At the other extreme are frames from a Disney feature and a Howdy Doody image by Milt Neill, together with Charlie McGill's cartoon-poster of the Spinks-Tyson fight.
Under its acting director, Giacomo de Stefano, the museum is hanging in there. But it plainly needs help from Conan, the Hulk or even Prince Valiant, and a grant from Daddy Warbucks wouldn't come amiss. The show is on view through Jan. 27, from 10 A.M. to 4 P.M. Tuesday through Friday and 12:30 P.M. to 4:30 P.M. Saturday and Sunday.

HEADLINE: NEW JERSEY OPINION;
Too Much For a Commuter

BYLINE: By Eric L. Muller; Eric L. Muller lives in Highland Park.

 BODY:
TO the world, Mikhail Gorbachev is the man who has rekindled nearly dead hopes for world peace. He is the man who has thrown open the shutters on the long-sealed window of Soviet history. He is a prince of light emerged from an empire of darkness. He is also the man who keeps me from reaching the second section of the newspaper by the Rahway station.
For years, my morning train ride to Manhattan was comfortably predictable. After settling into my window seat in New Brunswick, I would open the paper, turn to the weather map and scrutinize the progress of fronts and storms across the nation. This would take me to Edison. I would flip back to the front page for a scan of the headlines. The Metuchen and Metropark stations would pass by as I skimmed through the front section. 
By Rahway, I would be well into the second section, sometimes even as far as the obituaries. The Newark station would find me in the sports section, or perhaps the movie reviews on a Friday. As the train rolled to a stop in Penn Station, my paper would be neatly folded and tucked into the outside pocket of my shoulder bag.
Measuring my morning ride by my progress through the newspaper was easy in the good old days of Brezhnev, Andropov and Chernenko. Back then, a quick glance at a headline would tell me whether an article was for reading or for skipping. I knew I could automatically skip any article about missiles, Poland, shake-ups in the Soviet Politburo, arms negotiations or economic policy in the Soviet bloc. Only the headlines changed from day to day; the stories seemed to stay exactly the same.
In these days of glasnost and perestroika, no article may safely be skipped. Even the most mundane of articles contains some revelation, new proposal or startling innovation. One day President Gorbachev unilaterally removes every weapon but popguns and slingshots from Eastern Europe. The next day he sacks the entire Politburo and replaces it with the board of directors of I.B.M. A few days later he issues an edict declaring ''Iacocca'' to be required reading for all Soviet schoolchildren, then rushes off to sit in on keyboards at a Rolling Stones concert in Gorky Park.
It is the recent spate of stories like these that has slowed my reading to a snail's pace and confined me to the front section of the paper for the duration of my trip. While I struggle toward the editorial page, fellow commuters breeze through ''Finnegans Wake.'' Under Brezhnev, I considered moving closer to New York City to cut down on my commuting time; under Mr. Gorbachev, I am looking for housing at the end of the line.
My inability to make a real dent in the morning paper is not just frustrating; it is scary. If I am having trouble making it through one section, then the folks at the White House and the State Department must be absolutely drowning in the flood of articles, position papers, briefings, field reports, press releases and communiques that Mr. Gorbachev has unleashed.
President Bush has been faulted for reacting too slowly to change in the Warsaw Pact nations, but my guess is that he is actually responding to events as soon as he finds out about them. If his Presidency is anything like my morning commuting, he and his staff are understandably a bit behind in their reading.
Mr. Gorbachev's news offensive is clearly his strategy for world domination, and it is working. His plan is to keep the news coming fast and furious until we are several weeks behind in our reading. He will then announce the annexation of Western Europe and North America. By the time we actually learn of his action, three or four weeks later, we will already be the newest Soviet republic. Nikita Khrushchev may have threatened to bury us, but Mr. Gorbachev is actually doing it. He is burying us in newsprint.
The Bush Administration must take a hard line against the Gorbachev strategy. The President should ask our NATO allies to impose a complete ban on any news story with a dateline of Moscow, Warsaw, Budapest, Prague or East Berlin. He should then call for a series of news reduction talks aimed at bringing to manageable and verifiable levels the number of daily press releases, press conferences and photo opportunities to which each superpower is entitled. Only with a News Reduction Treaty in place can President Bush assure the American people that we will not fall victim to the Gorbachev media assault.
It is also the only way I will ever again reach the second section by the Rahway station.

HEADLINE: ABOUT NEW JERSEY

BYLINE: By Anthony DePalma

 BODY:
THE leader of the Broad Street Gang in Newark died a few weeks ago, and this hardhearted city wept.
His gang doesn't do much bragging, but it has left its mark on the street whose name it bears as well as in the city's far weedy corners and stifling apartments where hope is as rare as gold.
His gang is small, only six members, and they hang out on or just near Broad Street. It is the nonprofit community groups in Newark who named them, knowing that they can be tough and that unless you've got them on your side, you're in trouble.
The gang consists of Prudential Insurance, Public Service Electric and Gas, First Fidelity Bank, New Jersey Bell, Blue Cross/Blue Shield and Mutual Benefit Life, where its leader, Robert V. Van Fossan, worked until he died on Oct. 29. 
Every city has its own corporate good citizens, the companies that make the biggest single contributions to the local United Way and send someone to Chamber of Commerce meetings. They might put up a billboard at Christmas.
But here, where the poverty and the problems are on a scale that is out of the ordinary, the big companies have acted in an extraordinary way. For the people who run Newark, and those in the nonprofit organizations that try to make it livable, the Broad Street Gang has become a benevolent, sometimes frugal, sometimes generous partner that is essential to almost any project.
And usually out front with the money, or the support, or the personal physical presence that could lend legitimacy to an organization or its mission, was Mr. Van Fossan, known to many by his street name, Van.
It was Van who in the dark days of the 1970's promised that Newark could be better even though it looked hopeless. He led the way to restore Newark's neglected Symphony Hall. He was chairman of Renaissance Newark, the group that pushes the city's revival. Mutual Benefit's meeting rooms became ad hoc council chambers where ideas about fixing Newark's problems were aired and bold plans for the future were made. When the $30 million Performing Arts Center was on the ropes, it was Van who brought in a private investor, Raymond Chambers, and had Mutual put up half the letter of credit to get the project going.
It was also Van who set the tone for the gang over the last decade, taking the lead on many projects, cajoling his counterparts in the other headquarters to do more than they perhaps were inclined to do.
Now that he is gone, there's suddenly some doubt about what will happen in Newark. ''The Broad Street Gang just ain't what it used to be,'' said Richard W. Roper, director of the program for New Jersey affairs at Princeton's Woodrow Wilson School for Public and International Affairs and someone who lived and worked in Newark for years. ''Van's role in keeping corporate responsibility high on the agenda of the companies was critical. He was the glue that held the corporate actors in place in support of Newark's revitalization. Now that he's gone, I'm at a loss to identify his successor.''
The gang may not be what it used to be, but it is not coming apart. Everett Shaw, Newark's deputy mayor for development as well as the president of Renaissance Newark, has worked in other cities, but he believes that the gang probably contributes more money and energy, on the basis of each one of Newark's 315,000 residents, than any other corporate community in the country.
''Our corporate C.E.O.'s are more sensitive, more aware of what it takes to turn urban centers around that in any other place,'' Mr. Shaw said.
Corporations don't make contributions for purely altruistic reasons. For them it's a form of marketing, and they often select the projects they will support according to the type of image they want to put forward. They tend to be fairly conservative in their mission, which makes the projects they back most likely to succeed. The gang doesn't like to take big risks.
Neither do other companies elsewhere. But a few things set Newark apart. For one, its rock-bottom poverty and negative image present problems that often outstrip its comparatively minor size. Similiarly, the size of some of its big corporate leaders, particularly Prudential, the largest insurance company in the world, far exceeds what might be expected in a city with wooden letters identifying City Hall.
Their recognition of the size of the problems they confront might have helped persuade the corporations that their abilities to accomplish anything in Newark were limited if they acted on their own. Recently, they have joined with Mayor Sharpe James's administration in many initiatives, forging in the process a relationship other communities could envy.
''It's one thing to give money,'' Mayor James said one day recently when he attended a public ceremony at Penn Station wearing a maroon tie imprinted with the Gibraltar symbol of Prudential, ''but to give money and be active in partnership with the city and with community groups is symbolic of their committment to Newark and to the people of the city.''
That may be, but the money itself is substantial. Mutual Benefit's annual giving exceeds $2 million in Newark. Prudential tops $2.8 million. First Fidelity won't say. The other three are regulated and that puts limits on how much they can give, but even here it runs into hundreds of thousands.
What may be more important, though, is the broader involvement, the tangible presence of the gang members that provides the support holding many projects together. For instance, 100 Blue Cross employees now meet every other week with Newark schoolchildren enrolled in a program that guarantees them college scholarships if they finish school. Eventually, Blue Cross will be meeting with 400 children on a regular basis. By 1991, Mutual Benefit may tie some part of employees' bonuses to their voluntary service to community.
Public Service's decision to build a gleaming new headquarters just off Broad Street in 1981 was seen as a symbolic reaffirmation in Newark's future. The building's embracing front plaza, where concerts are held weekly in summer, and where the Puerto Rican Festival and the African Festival were staged, had become a focus of the new Newark.
First Fidelity has lent money to developers putting up stores and housing throughout the city. New Jersey Bell was recently honored by the White House for its James Street tutorial program, in which every Tuesday 60 Bell employees work with third- and fourth-grade pupils.
Prudential, because of its sheer size and wealth, has been able to finance dozens of organizations and projects. Its employees get involved in the Boys Club and the Community Food Bank. And - some say this is most significant - its investment in the five-building Gateway office complex near Penn Station forms the core of Newark's economic recuperation.
The city's nonprofit organizations often find themselves making the trek down Broad Street, financing proposal in hand. ''They set the tone on policy and programs,'' said Lorna K. Johnson, president of the Urban League of Essex County, an established, old organization that runs a large work training program and other activities in Newark. Ms. Johnson, who is leaving her position at the end of the year, said the gang's support was crucial to the survival of programs like hers, which receives more than $100,000 from the gang.
The Broad Street Gang was feeling pretty good about itself, finally seeing some of its investments pay off in the form of a stronger, brighter Newark. Now that Van is gone, the gang will continue to play a crucial role, but nobody expects it to be quite the same.
The men in charge of the other corporations all are involved in the community, but not in the way Van was. Robert C. Winters, the chairman of Prudential, has the most visible spot in the gang, but his interests are more on a national level than the company's front yard. Mr. Van Fossan's successor at Mutual Benefit, Henry Kates, has agreed to fill Van's positions as president of the Newark Chamber of Commerce and head of Symphony Hall. But even he concedes that it would be difficult for anyone to fill Van's shoes.
''Leaders tend to emerge rather than declare themselves,'' Mr. Kates said. ''I think all of us are looking to see where we can fill the void.''

HEADLINE: Crystalline Ice Fantasies In Frozen Manchuria

BYLINE: By MOANA TREGASKIS; MOANA TREGASKIS is a writer who lives in Honolulu.

 BODY:
FAR north of China's Great Wall, a city of crystalline sculptured ice emitting colored light transforms long frozen winters into a fantasyland. The annual Ice Lantern Festival in Harbin, capital of the northeastern border province of Heilungkiang and once a city of many Russians, celebrates the lunar new year like no other place in China.
While the rest of the country frolics with paper lanterns, Harbin's vast Zhaolin Park is transformed into a city carved of ice. From Jan. 1 through the end of February, fanciful creatures and giant animals inhabit a world of icy palaces and tall pagodas, snowy flowers, pavilions and frozen tableaus from Chinese legends. In daylight the scene takes on a silvery cast. At night it blossoms in rainbows of light that blaze from inside the sculptures. The peacock struts his multicolored tail, a volcano erupts with red light, the stout-hearted climb a bluish replica of an ice-covered Great Wall, and children scramble up the tail of an elephant to slide down its icy trunk. 
Ice sculpture is a part of life in the Harbin (Harb-EEN), the industrial city and river port about 800 miles northeast of Beijing. Here, in the region still known as Manchuria, the largest Russian settlement outside Russia was established after World War I, and some of the city's architecture still reflects that time. Later, Harbin had one of the largest European populations in the Far East, until the Communists took over after World War II. And on a visit there last winter - before the harsh crackdown on pro-deomcracy demonstrators in Beijing and other cities - I noticed among the ice sculptures, along with other foreign themes, an exhibit inspired by Disney and a carved dolphin representing Alaska.
Throughout the city ice-covered pandas, prancing horses and tigers and creations of frozen falling water adorn traffic circles and the entryways of hotels and government buildings. In midwinter days that peak around zero degrees Fahrenheit, the high energy level of the Harbinese is noticeable, and perhaps it can be attributed to food portions fit for a giant, or to the fact that all buldings are superbly heated. Temperatures can sink to minus 20 at night yet no one seems to mind. The Harbinese leave their television sets and do what northerners everywhere do in winter - put on another layer. They stroll about eating ice cream clutched in mittened hands. They claim it melts too fast in the summer.
Reminiscent of a misty Oriental painting, a deceptively pleasing lavender pall hangs over city and countryside. Rather than bits of delicate cloud, the haze is a false curtain of polluting smoke from industrial coal and heating wood fires. ''Black snow,'' said a visitor from Pennsylvania sweeping up a handful. ''Just like Pittsburgh when I was a kid.'' The ice carvings are swept clean daily of snowfall and pollution.
A bustling city of some three million, Harbin is an exception in a land crammed with ancient sites. Until the turn of the century a mere village whose name meant ''where the fishing nets are dried,'' its character was forever altered by Russians and by Japanese. Russian architecture, especially old Orthodox churches and the railroad station, brought fame and the sobriquet, Moscow of the East. Japanese warlords imposed the birth of Harbin's thriving heavy industry.
The history of Heilungkiang plays a major role in the clamorous events of 20th-century China. In 1896 Russia negotiated a contract to build a railroad to Vladivostok through the province that has developed since into the Texas of China. (The nation's largest oilfields begin 62 miles northwest of Harbin. In 1914, following an agreement that extended Russian rights along the rail line to Britain as well, several European countries and the United States signed up for equal privileges, sending a swarm of foreign entrepreneurs to Harbin and turning it into an international city. In 1917 White Russian refugees surged into Harbin, which grew into alarge Russian settlement. Then in February 1932 Japanese troops occupied the city, renaming the province Manchukuo.
Throughout World War II, under the oppressive rule of Japan's Manchuria-based Kwantung army, the heavy industrial trend was begun with forced production in a province rich in coal and other largely untapped resources. The Soviet Army took back Harbin in 1945 and withdrew when Chinese troops were installed by agreement.
THE Russians are long gone from Harbin, leaving onion-domed churches and little trellised street kiosks that perk up the drab square buildings of newer vintage. The most interesting aspect of the provincial museum, built in 1923 as the commercial center, is outside, where symmetrical domes and spires rise at each end. The immense railroad station, built when the Russians projected a great northern transport hub in Harbin, is no longer large enough.
In the Daolichu district not far from Zhaolin Park, the skyline is studded with cupolas, spires and scalloped turrets. St. Sophia's Church is a fine example, its great onion bulb a tinge of old Moscow. While numerous churches were ravaged during the Chinese Cultural Revolution in the late 1960's and turned into warehouses, several remain. In the Nangang district the vaulted Orthodox church (Church of China Eastern Orthodox) is always open, and elderly devotees come and go. Services are conducted in Russian. The church was reopened in 1984. Nearby, the Gothic Church of the Christian religion (Lutheran), built in 1911, is locked except Sundays. Services are conducted in Chinese; the church was reopened in 1980.
The deep frozen Songari River is the soul of the Ice Lantern Festival. Winding through the northern part of the city, it provides the building blocks. Work begins in late November when metal stakes are driven into the ice. By hook, crane and truck, ice blocks are moved to the park where carpenters using electric saws slice them into smaller chunks. The last three weeks of December are a flurry of carving as more than 2,000 artisans and electricians leave factory jobs to apply skills and fancy to the ice.
By Jan. 1 the entrance walk is lined with birds and animals on pedestals, leading to an icy cauldron with leaping red streamers simulating the Olympic torch. Pathways with whimsical creatures and ice railings curve toward a transparent Moorish palace with colored lights, a multilevel pagoda with 10 100-foot-tall pavonine spires, ice bridges and gardens, a frozen onion-domed church, or a glowing ice rink for dancing. Chinese and Western music hoots from speakers while frolicking lighted deer and rabbits, penguins, dragons and a phoenix accompany Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Beyond a tall gateway of horseshoe-shaped ice blocks on the high road, the Sungari River turns into a huge playground. At an ice-walled slide that shoots down the steep bank, revelers sit on woven mats or stand in street shoes for careening descents to the frozen water. A bone-chilling wind accompanies merrymakers who hire ice boats to sail the wide river, or one-horse gigs mounted on sleds and decorated with colored streamers. Throughout the winter members of a little troupe of outdoor sports fanatics named the Harbin Penguins jump into the frigid water to swim where the three-foot-thick ice has been hacked away.
The festival, first held in 1963 in the tottering days of economic recovery from the Great Leap Forward, collided with the Cultural Revolution but restarted in 1978 and has been picking up size each year. International competition in ice carving began three years ago and in the winter of 1989, France took the gold. Circling a nearly full-scale Arc de Triomphe, shiny transparent sculptures included a glistening Liberte (first prize), a great fat sumo wrestler (third prize, Japan) and a fighting Australian kangaroo. Harbinese clustered at Alaska's entry, a totem-style dolphin with a placard in Chinese describing the Aleutian fairy tale of the dolphin god.
It's a sure bet that a visit to Harbin will include too much food. Winter meals are piled on platters in at least seven courses. The Chinese dishes are sour, mildly hot, fresh, salty and substantial; some are crisp and many are oily. Western fare has a bit of old Russia clinging to it, especially in pastries and braised dishes. The Harbinese favor sausage snacks - white-meat and red sausages are popular, stuffed in wheat buns, with pancake or steamed bread, or sauerkraut noodles. In street markets, fresh vegetables from southern provinces are kept under heavy quilts to prevent freezing. About the city, streamer flags on single poles announce restaurants - red for local, blue for Mongolian food and neither very clean. In addition to beef and mutton, pork is abundant. It is said that all leftovers go to the pigs and I believe it - the porkers wandering around country villages are enormous. Group travelers can arrange for a banquet serving the so-called four dainties of Harbin: stewed bear's paw, one of the oldest delicacies in Chinese recipes; braised moose's snout in brown sauce; fei-long (grouse) soup, and white houtou mushrooms served with shredded chicken.
Dancing is another diversion on winter nights. To Chinese popular music performed by a six-piece band and solist, throngs of dancers swirl around ballroom floors in a smooth adagio-like step. Western cassettes blast during the intervals when the dance floor takes on the look of a crowd of beginners trying to learn unrestrained disco movements. For an entrance fee of 6 yuan (50 cents), whether the music is live or canned, everyone dances (usually 200 to 300) - couples, men and men, women and women, threesomes and singles. (The regulars' boots were stashed neatly under tables.) There are about 20 dance halls in Harbin.
During Harbin's winter, Manchurians offer advisories on keeping warm outdoors. We wore the recommended down clothing, played amid frozen creations and always remembered the final admonition: after staying out for some time, don't drink hot water until your teeth get warm.
 
PLANNING A TRIP TO HARBIN
 
Getting There
Air China (formerly C.A.A.C.) operates many domestic flights to Harbin: from Beijing, Changchun, Shanghai, Shenyang and Guangzhou (Canton). Travelers can reach Harbin by rail from any province. The Chinese say that travel on the Trans-Siberian Railroad offers better service on the run from China to the Soviet Union, with Chinese staff, than in the other direction with Russian personnel.
Travel in China is controlled by China International Travel Service (C.I.T.S.), the government wing concerned with all foreign visitors. It provides English-speaking guides and has the final say in hotel choice. The best prices are in packages from travel agents specializing in mainland travel; they have Beijing branch offices. There are agencies in Hong Kong that arrange personalized itineraries and simplify the sometimes difficult visa procedures. They have a wide knowledge of hotels and arrange everything in 24 hours. An all-inclusive week in the north is about $1500 round trip from Hong Kong. One experienced agency is Lap Ming International Travel Service, East Ocean Center, 98 Granville Road, T.S.T. Kowloon, Hong Kong; telephone, 3-723-8803.
 
Currency and Customs
China's two-tier money system is confusing. Renminbi (R.M.B.) is People's Money and foreign exchange certificates (F.E.C.'s) are Tourist Money, both issued in denominations of yuan (pronounced wan). In exchange for cash or traveler's checks from international banks, visitors receive exchange certificates; a dollar equals about 3.71 yuan. Tourists must pay for purchases in F.E.C.'s; if you want to buy something at a street market, you'll have a small amount of R.M.B. Stay clear of the black market in currency; the penalties are stiff.
 
Where to Stay
Harbin is oriented to international trade and there is no shortage of hotels; reservations required. While cleanliness standards are not up to those in the United States , the hotels are are adequate, with restaurants and shops and English-speaking staff. Good are the Swan Hotel (Tian E Fandian), which was crammed with Russian buyers attending a trade fair when we stayed there (73 Zhongsang Road; telephone, 54041); and the Guoji Fandian (International Hotel, 124 Dazhi Street; 31441). Doubles with baths and TV from about $20.
Top of the line is the new wing of the Friendship Hotel. Full of marble, it is considered the best in Harbin. Doubles with baths and TV from $21 (57 Youyi Road; 47132). Opened this year, the new Milky Way Hotel charges from $21 for doubles with baths and TV.
 
Other Advice
Practical winter clothing is essential; fancy dress unnecessary. Take a down jacket, lined boots, warm slacks, a cap with earflaps, sweater, mittens and silk longjohns, which can be bought cheaply in China (though not in extra-large sizes). Women need warm slacks; a skirt or dress should be worn only indoors and not in transit.
The common cold with lingering cough is a hazard of China travel in any season. Known as Peking throat and caused by pollution, it happens anywhere, anytime. Take your own remedies and prescription drugs. Drink only boiled water (tea) or bottled liquids. No special innoculations are necessary for China, but a gamma-globulin shot to prevent hepatitis is recommended.
 
Dining and Shopping
Unless you have an iron stomach, hotel dining rooms are the safest bet, as well as restaurants recommended by C.I.T.S. It is said that Huamei in Zhongyang Street is the best in Harbin for Russian food. When you go to outside restaurants, don't plan on using the toilet facilities - they are not clean and flushes seldom work. Street markets are everywhere in the city, as well as two large department stores crammed with merchandise and always crowded. The Friendship Store, on the top floor of the Second Department Store, offers curios and toys. The Xiangyang Fur Store has a large selection of leather and fur, with coats of fox, squirrel or sable from $67; quality is mediocre. - M. T.

HEADLINE: FIGHTING IN PANAMA;
Noriega's Move Meets Approval At White House

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 24

 BODY:
The White House expressed satisfaction tonight that Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega was ''under the control of diplomatic authorities.''
The Bush Administration seemed pleased even though it was not clear whether the general would be turned over to United States or Panamanian authorities for trial, or if a deal might be worked out that would free him to live in another country, possibly Spain or Cuba. In Panama, Panamanian and foreign officials said General Noriega had expressed a preference to live in either of those places.
''His reign of terror is over,'' said President Bush's spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, who was alone in his press office in a deserted White House.
Mr. Fitzwater said the United States ''will continue to pursue avenues for bringing General Noriega, now located, to justice.'' He said the President ''is gratified that General Noriega has been located.'' 
Mr. Bush, who went to the Pentagon this morning for a briefing on the fifth day of military operations in Panama, was told the news late this afternoon at the Presidential retreat at Camp David, where he is celebrating the Christmas holiday with his family. He was told at about 4 P.M. by his national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, Mr. Fitzwater said.
The Bush Administration had said that one of its major objectives in sending United States troops to Panama was to apprehend General Noriega and bring him to justice. Tonight's announcement that the general had turned himself in to the Vatican envoy in Panama fell short of that goal.
But the White House said it was pleased with the surprise development because, as one Administration official put it, ''We know where he is, he's totally separated from the rest of society and he can no longer be a rallying point for his forces.''
It could not be learned in Washington whether an agreement had been reached beforehand among General Noriega, the new Panamanian Government and the Papal Nuncio.
Many critics had complained last week that if General Noriega was not captured, Mr. Bush's decision to send American troops to Panama would be viewed as less than a clear success.
 
Restoring Law and Order
But the White House immediately began to contend tonight that all of its major objectives had been realized. Mr. Fitzwater said General Noriega's decision would help the United States in its efforts to restore stability to Panama City and to set up the Government of President Guillermo Endara.
''As we work to help return law and order to Panama City, and as the Government of President Endara begins its work, the demise of General Noriega sends a strong signal that freedom and democracy in Panama are now on the rise,'' Mr. Fitzwater said.
Although the Bush Administration said Wednesday morning that the apprehension of General Noriega was one of the four principal objectives of the American invasion, senior officials spent the last several days preparing the public for the possibility that the general would not be captured.
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said this morning on the ABC News program ''This Week'' that the capture of General Noriega would be ''the icing on the cake,'' suggesting that the mission would be successful even without apprehending the general because ''any ability by him to control the situation in Panama is gone.''
Mr. Cheney left for Panama later today - before the news that General Noriega was turning himself over to the Vatican representative - to meet with American troops and review the situation.
Over the years, the Reagan and Bush Administrations tried a variety of diplomatic and economic means to try to oust the Panamanian military leader.
Recalling the diplomatic efforts, one Administration official said tonight that the Government ''had shown flexibility about Noriega in the past, and we will probably be willing to show flexibility in the future.''
According to international law, diplomatic missions are safe havens for those seeking asylum. American military forces had surrounded the Cuban and Nicaraguan Embassies in Panama City to prevent General Noriega from taking asylum there. But they apparently were not monitoring the Papal Nuncio's office in Panama City, because the general was reported to have driven up in a private car and walked in alone, after calling first.
After General Noriega's turned himself in, however, the Papal Nuncio's residence in the Paitilla district of Panama City was surrounded by about 200 American soldiers and three tanks.
Administration officials were aware of the paradox of the situation.
Last week, worried that the wily general was still on the loose, they tried to blacken his reputation by revealing the cache of strange items found at his headquarters and portraying him as a ''narco-terrorist'' under the sway of the occult, cocaine and pornography.
 
A Different Image
By turning himself in alone on Christmas Eve to Pope John Paul II's representative, Msgr. Jose Sebastian Laboa, the general presented a different image as he turned from a fugitive to a man seeking political asylum.
A Justice Department spokeswoman, Deborah Burstion-Wade, said she was not sure of General Noriega's status under the protection of the Vatican envoy.
''Although events are unclear at this point, we still remain very interested in bringing him to the United States to stand trial,'' she said. She added that she did not know whether any Justice Department attorneys were on hand in Panama to formulate a request for extradition.
Raymond Takiff, a Miami lawyer on General Noriega's defense team in the United States, told Reuters tonight that he had learned that a mob was on its way to the building where Mr. Noriega had sought asylum. ''We're afraid they're going to hang him,'' he told the news agency, adding that he was surprised that General Noriega had turned himself in to the Papal Nuncio and that the general was not taking advice from his American lawyers.
 
No Decision on Extradition
Defense Secretary Cheney had suggested for the first time on television this morning that even if caught, the general might not be brought back to the United States. ''If he were to be captured in Panama and arrested, then I suppose we'd have to sit down at that point and decide whether he was going to be brought back to the United States, extradicted if you will, or whether he would be prosecuted in Panama.''
General Noriega's supporters have pointed out that it would be embarrassing for the United States to bring to trial the Panamanian who worked for the Central Intelligence Agency through several Administrations, because he might try to use classified documents in his defense.
Washington insiders warned last week that it could be risky for Mr. Bush, who was head of the C.I.A. when General Noriega was still associated with it, if the general was captured alive and returned to justice in the United States.
The Panamanian threatened Mr. Bush during the 1988 campaign, saying he had damaging information about the Vice President's role in the Iran-contra scandal, an assertion that Mr. Bush hotly denied.
''The worst thing for George Bush would be Noriega on trial up here filling in embarrassing blanks,'' Kevin Phillips, a conservative analyst, said.
 
'Many Secret Skeletons'
William Schneider, an analyst at the American Enterprise Institute, agreed. ''I'm not convinced this Administration really wants Noriega to go on trial,'' he said. ''Noriega worked with the C.I.A. and claims to know a great many secret skeletons that are buried close to George Bush. A protracted Noriega trial would be a real horror for this Administration.''
Before General Noriega's decision to turn himself in was announced, Mr. Bush attended a Pentagon briefing on Panama and said afterward that he believed that American troops had achieved ''a real turnaround'' in ending the chaos that had reigned since the United States had invaded early Wednesday morning.
Evidence that General Noriega's action came as a surprise to the President was reflected in Mr. Bush's remarks after the briefing. Asked when American troops might be able to capture the general, the President replied, ''If I knew that, why both of us would be a lot smarter.''
Mr. Bush said then that his military advisers had told him that ''the emphasis now is on cleaning up the last parts of resistance, seeing that civilian government take over, tranquillity in the city and then moving on food and medicine.''

Soviet TV View: Ceausescu [Equals] Stalin

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Dec. 24

 BODY:
A Soviet television news program tonight celebrated the fall of Nicolae Ceausescu in Rumania by comparing him to two former Soviet leaders, Stalin as a despotic abuser of his own people and Brezhnev as a nepotistic corrupter of his Government.
The news program, ''Seven Days,'' presented a seven-minute opening dispatch that brought the nation up to date on the third day of the military struggle for Rumania. It also offered a brief biography of Mr. Ceausescu that noted that his final speech included a promise that Rumania's living standards would soon improve. 
''It was too late,'' the narrator said, as the film and commentary depicted the Rumanian leader's flight, the fall of his Government and the aftermath, in which various democratic improvements have been promised.
The news program was noteworthy both for its terms of reference to two Soviet leaders and for a following report that summarized a state of general economic crisis in East Germany, Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria.
The program's reference points seemed particularly tailored to the Soviet public's anxieties, since economic hardship remains the dominant issue in the nation, overshadowing even the continuing democratic revolt in East Europe.
The comparison of Mr. Ceausescu with Stalin and Brezhnev was offered in dramatic tones by a narrator who said that news reports from Rumania indicated that 324 members of the Ceausescu family had been found living luxuriously by dint of their patronage jobs on the Government payroll.
''In repressing his people, he may have lagged behind our Stalin, but he nevertheless worked hard at it,'' the narrator said of Mr. Ceausescu.
Of immediate interest to Soviet officials was that Ion Iliescu, the spokesman for the Rumanian National Salvation Front, the new interim governing panel in Bucharest, has known President Mikhail S. Gorbachev since they were university students together 35 years ago.
During the day, Mr. Gorbachev again brought the National Congress up to date on the news from Bucharest, noting that fighting was continuing but that events seemed to favor the eventual success of the popular revolt against the Ceausescu Government.
Mr. Gorbachev continued to make a point of ruling out suggestions from the United States Government and elsewhere that military intervention by the Soviet Union might be in order. The Soviet leader noted that while some members of the new provisional governing panel in Rumania had been asking for foreign military help, the Chief of Staff of the Rumanian Army had said no such aid was needed.
President Gorbachev continued to treat the upheavals in the Eastern bloc as a trend that has his approval. He did not address the question of whether the uprisings in Eastern capitals might inspire greater protest in the Soviet Union over the undelivered economic promises of his perestroika program.
Thus far they have not. In a sudden change of plans that seems designed to ease discontent, Mr. Gorbachev recently revamped his economic program away from his long-sought renewal of basic industry toward a short-term improvement in the nation's abysmal consumer economy.
Various critics have since warned that this is a repetition of the 70-year pattern of Communist economic failure. But Government officials say they are embarking on radical economic reform aimed at achieving Soviet success in the world economy.

HEADLINE: Upheaval in the East: The New Leaders;
Bucharest Government Has Yet to Take Shape

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 24

 BODY:
Little is known in the United States about the members of the Council of National Salvation, the group trying to organize a government in Rumania following the fall of President Nicolae Ceausescu, State Department analysts said today.
Though the names of several committee members have come to public attention, Steve Kane, a member of the State Department's task force dealing with the events in Rumania, emphasized that the council has neither defined its leadership structure nor named individuals to top posts, including chairman or head of government.
On Friday, the council did announce the formation of a provisional government to run the country and prepare for elections in the spring.
In contrast to the anonymity surrounding most council members, a considerable amount is circulating about two prominent members, Ion Iliescu and Corneliu Manescu. 
Mr. Iliescu, an ousted member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party who announced the arrest of Mr. Ceausescu, has emerged as the principal spokesman for the new council and is believed to be a contender for the position of head of state. He is a former Rumanian Foreign Minister who was placed under house arrest in March for co-signing a letter urging Mr. Ceausescu to abandon his cult of personality or to resign.
The other Rumanians believed to be playing a leading role in the council, according to State Department analysts and other experts on the region, are:
SILVIU BRUCAN - A former Rumanian Ambassador to the United States who served as a senior editor of the Communist Party newspaper, Mr. Brucan worked with Mr. Manescu to form the council, Rumanian television reports say.
In March, Mr. Brucan was one of the former officials of the Government and party who sent the open letter to Mr. Ceausescu, accusing him of destroying Rumania's economy and terrorizing the population by abusing the secret police. All of the former officials were put under police guard.
Mr. Brucan had been placed under house arrest two years ago for telling Western correspondents that the Communist leadership had lost touch with the workers and had become their exploiters.
''I was a fishbone in their throat,'' he told a friend in Washington last year. ''They couldn't swallow me and they couldn't spit me out.''
GEN. NICOLAE MILITARU - The committee announced Saturday night that General Militaru, an army officer who was demoted by President Ceausescu, would be its Defense Minister.
Besides former officials, the committee includes these noted poets and writers:
DOINA CORNEA - Considered one of Rumania's most outspoken dissidents, Miss Cornea, a writer, has been under virtual house arrest for more than a year.
''The Rumanian people - you too, I think - are at a crossroads,'' Miss Cornea wrote to President Ceausescu in April. ''This exhausting rule you impose on us, against the fiber of our being - constitutional, morale and biological - is becoming even more unbearable.''
MIRCEA DINESCU - Mr. Dinescu, a poet, stood with Mr. Manescu on Friday after the takeover of the Rumanian television studios in Bucharest. He was thrown out of the Communist Party in March because of his contact with foreigners and was dismissed in the spring from the magazine Rumania Literara.
Mr. Dinescu told the Rumanian writers union in the summer that he had been placed under house arrest in a rural town because he had given an interview to the French newspaper Liberation. Since April, he said, he had been under 24-hour surveillance.
ANNA BLANDIANA - An intellectual and outspoken critic of Mr. Ceausescu, Miss Blandiana has published a number of poems and short stories in which she described the somber atmosphere of daily life in Rumania.
Several times during the last few years, Miss Blandiana defied orders from the Government that she discontinue her writing, said a former high-ranking official in the Rumanian intelligence service.
AUREL DRAGOSCH MUNTEANU - Mr. Munteanu, the former editor in chief of a literary magazine, recently sent a series of letters to Mr. Ceausescu, criticizing his political and economic programs.
The secret police, in response to Mr. Munteanu's criticism, interrogated and beat him on several occasions, the former intelligence official said.

HEADLINE: Hispanic Population Suffering Along With Massachusetts Economy

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOSTON, Dec. 22

 BODY:
For the estimated 300,000 Hispanic residents of Massachusetts, many of whom remained mired in poverty in the years when the state's economy flourished, the outlook as the economy stagnates is especially bleak.
By most social and financial measures no other ethnic group faces as many problems.
''I don't think anyone in the Hispanic community has had the illusion that we've been in good times,'' said State Representative Nelson A. Merced, who last year became the first Hispanic lawmaker elected to the legislature here. ''And I think they're going to get worse. Clearly, the state is not going to have the resources to deal with some of these problems.'' 
Statistics compiled in a recent study by the Boston Foundation, a private nonprofit group that does research on social issues, show that the poverty rate rose for Hispanic families between 1980 and this year, while the rate of black families and white families in poverty declined.
The Hispanic dropout rate from Boston public schools is 53.8 percent, the highest of any group. Unemployment is running at about 50 percent among Hispanics workers statewide, higher than for any other ethnic group. The rate of underweight babies born to Puerto Ricans is almost twice that of whites in Massachusetts, and a Hispanic woman is 10 times as likely to have AIDS as a white woman.
Comparisons like those are repeated across New England and the country, said Frank Bonilla, the director of the Center for Puerto Rican Studies at Hunter College in New York. ''It's a feature of recovery as much as stagnation, and that's what is so alarming,'' he said.
 
Few Agencies Address Problems
Although the Hispanic population in Massachusetts grew from about 1,200 in 1960 to about 150,000 to 1980, and has doubled in the last nine years, there are few agencies in the state that address those citizens' specific problems. Many Hispanic residents here speak only Spanish and others are subjected to job discrimination even when they are proficient in English. The agencies that do exist to help them have had to struggle for money and predict that the waiting lists for their classes in job skills and English will grow even longer as state money is squeezed from their budgets.
''We're in the middle of making some very, very difficult decisions about cutting back on programs, when obviously there are great needs,'' said Frieda Garcia, executive director of the United South End Settlements, a social service agency in Boston's Roxbury section. Her budget had to be reduced to $2.4 million for next year from $2.7 million this year, largely because of state budget cuts.
Massachusetts is experiencing the worst deficit in its history this year. The total deficit is about $1.2 billion, and to comply with the state's balanced-budget law, legislators are making deep cuts in spending and are talking about raising taxes. A state program for immigrants called Gateway Cities was cut to $2 million this year from $11 million two years ago, and then the $2 million was withheld.
But many experts say Hispanic residents have not relied heavily on such services, partly out of apprehension about Government programs and partly from ignorance about their existence. As a result, gauging the depth of their needs is difficult because little data have been collected. At least 55 percent of all Hispanic residents of the state are Puerto Rican, with a large proportion of Dominicans as well. In recent years, many people from Peru, El Salvador, Guatemala and other Latin American countries have arrived. It is not clear how many are illegal aliens.
''The awareness of the problems is very new, but it's not that people in the community haven't been talking about them,'' said Miren Uriarte, the director of the Mauricio Gaston Institute for Latino Community Development and Public Policy, established earlier this month at the University of Massachusetts. ''It's that other people didn't listen. Now the population is getting large and the problems remain unattended, and something needs to happen.''
 
Few Jobs Offer Growth
Complicating the problems facing Hispanic residents is the Massachusetts economy's emphasis on service jobs, rather than manufacturing, said Jaime Talero, the executive director of Oficina Hispana, a nonprofit advocacy agency in Boston. Even in the years when the economy was flourishing, the percentage of Boston's Hispanic families headed by a single parent rose from 74 percent to 78.7 percent between 1980 and this year, a study released earlier this month by the Boston Foundation showed. A survey of other major American cities by the same group found poverty declined slightly for Hispanic single-parent families, from 70.1 percent in 1980 to 68.9 percent in 1987.
''The structure of employment in Massachusetts is becoming increasingly stratified,'' Mr. Talero said. ''People come here for jobs, and they see that yes, there are a lot of jobs, but no, they're not for Hispanics.''
While other immigrants, pulled themselves up from poverty by starting out on factory floors and working their way up to positions as foremen and managers, Hispanic immigrants have arrived at a time when jobs affording that opportunity are few and far between.
The jobs they can find, Mr. Talero said, are ''low-level, very low-paying jobs.''
''The building cleaning and maintenance industry is dominated by Hispanics,'' he said. ''If you enter into that kind of cleaning job, it doesn't prepare you for anything else. If you start in a cleaning job, that's where you'll stay.''
Discrimination creates further obstacles, many advocates and experts say. ''There is a lot of discrimination when you try to enter the work force, and then a lot of discrimination that obstructs the upward mobility of Latinos,'' said Millie Rivas, assistant director of the Gandara Mental Health Center in Springfield. ''When they quote the unemployment rate, those are the ones who have solicited work. There's a much larger group that has just given up.''
 
Job Searches Can Last a Year
The center tries to find jobs for people in its substance-abuse treatment program, but the barriers mean that people often try to find jobs for a year before succeeding, ''unless it's auto mechanics or janitorial services or kitchen work,'' Ms. Rivas said.
Another source of problems is that Hispanic residents rely on public education, which has not responded fully to specific needs, other advocates said. Dropout rates are high, and even the students who graduate often find they are not prepared for the job market.
''We have identified in Boston more than 20 schools that have at least 50 students who are Hispanic, but no bilingual staff,'' said Javier Colon, a lawyer at Multicultural Education, Training and Advocacy Inc. in Somerville. ''The whole affirmative action program has not worked for Hispanics in the school system. There has not been any substantial increase in Hispanics at the teaching or administrative levels.''
Bilingual-education programs do exist across the state, but most of them try to phase the children out by the third grade. Then the children suffer from a lack of sensitivity to their culture and many later drop out, Mr. Colon said. A dropout prevention program initiated by his group and Hispanic parents lists among its ''Common Sense Tips'' things like: ''Learn how to pronounce students' names correctly first and last. Make the effort to call students by their names.''
With this kind of program, advocates for Hispanic residents of the state are trying to have a voice in the systems they rely on. In the heavily Hispanic town of Chelsea, just outside Boston, the first Hispanic citizen ever was elected to the school committee this fall.
It is a slow process, said Mr. Merced, the state representative. His first term, he said, has felt like ''I'm riding a horse and we're going in different directions.''

HEADLINE: On the Frigid Great Lakes, Ore Shippers Rush to Beat the Ice

BYLINE: By WILLIAM E. SCHMIDT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ESCANABA, Mich., Dec. 21

 BODY:
Running full speed through the black Lake Michigan night, the Joseph L. Block was 20 miles offshore and inbound for Escanaba when her searchlights picked out the front edge of the ice, a jagged sheet nearly a foot thick, smooth and hard as steel.
On the bridge of the ore carrier, Capt. Duane Carlton braced and ordered engines to half, as the 728-foot Block, wreathed in clouds of mist rising off the nearly frozen lake, nudged through the slabs of floe ice.
Suddenly, there was a deep metallic groan, and the entire boat shuddered as her rounded prow smashed into the ice. The Block hesitated and then churned slowly forward, the huge plates of ice creaking and snapping as Captain Carlton pushed the carrier's 7,000-horsepower engines to full.
On the lake, the temperature was nearly 8 degrees below zero, with a 20-mile-an-hour wind whipping snow across the ice. In the brittle darkness ahead, between the Block and the Escanaba harbor light, two other freighters were already stuck in the ice, trapped by what weather forecasters and lake shippers have described as the earliest and hardest winter on the Great Lakes since 1976. 
 
Trying to Beat the Ice
Even before the brutal cold of this week, when record-breaking temperatures stayed well below zero for nearly two full days all across the region, carriers on the Great Lakes have been hurrying to beat the ice, which has seized harbors and shipping channels in conditions like those of mid-January.
''It's a race with winter,'' said Dan Cornillie, the manager of fleet operations for the Inland Steel Company, which operates the Joseph S. Block and two other vessels that ship iron ore pellets to their Indiana steel mills from mines in Minnesota and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Conditions permitting, he hopes to squeeze in three more runs before the ice makes it impossible.
For steel makers like Inland, these late season runs are vital. Ships like the Block carry as much as 33,000 tons of iron ore, which is piled in huge mountains beside their steel plants, to keep blast furnaces running until spring, when the ore boats are able to get back on the lakes.
While the Block made harbor late Wednesday night, the ice slowed her considerably, adding four hours to what is normally a 21-hour run to Escanaba from Indiana Harbor, near Chicago. But her sister ship, the Wilfred Sykes, was not as fortunate; the 678-foot ore boat spent 13 hours locked in the ice off Escanaba, before a tug boat could reach her and break her loose.
Even the behemoth Columbia Star, which, at 1,000 feet, is nearly 40 feet longer than the Queen Elizabeth 2, was a prisoner of the weather. Outbound from Escanaba and fully loaded with ore, it took her nearly eight hours on Wednesday to make barely four miles in the ice.
 
Moving Ore by Rail
George J. Ryan, the president of the Lake Carriers' Association, said the early winter will force carriers to leave an estimated 1.6 million tons of ore and other materials on docks. It will either have to be moved by rail, at much higher costs, or left there until the ice breaks up in the spring.
''What is happening out there boggles the mind,'' said Mr. Ryan, who said carriers are pushing to move as much of the material as possible before ice locks them out entirely. ''We have not seen a winter like this in a long time.''
Because of extreme cold and channels clogged with ice, the Soo Locks at Sault Ste. Marie, Mich., which carry vessels between Lake Superior and the lower lakes, will shut down at midnight Wednesday, one of the earliest closings in recent years.
''Basically, every place is frozen up, and a lot sooner than anyone expected,'' said Lieut. Bruce Toney, the operations duty office for the Ninth United States Coast Guard District in Cleveland, which oversees the Great Lakes.
Ice floes and windrows, ridges of ice formed where floe ice smashed together, have clogged shipping lanes from the St. Lawrence Seaway in upstate New York to Milwaukee Harbor on Lake Michigan.
The worst conditions are on Lake Superior, where some vessels that arrived in Duluth this week decided to lay over there for the winter, rather than risk a run back toward the Soo Locks.
 
Some Areas Covered in Ice
Some areas, like Green Bay in Wisconsin and Saginaw Bay in Michigan, are completely covered with ice, and Coast Guard vessels are helping commercial tugs free freighters locked in harbors.
Ordinarily, the shipping season on the Great Lakes runs from mid-March until early or mid-January. Before the onset of bitter winter weather, shippers were headed for one of their most successful years since the recession of the early 1980's.
The vitality of the big lake boats is a direct measure of the state of the Midwestern industrial economy. Although lake boats also carry coal, cement, grain and other bulk materials, the major commodity is taconite, the pellets of iron ore and limestone used by the steel mills of Detroit, Cleveland and northwest Indiana.
As the steel industry has increased production in recent years, the demand for taconite has grown as well, and vessels that were once mothballed have been brought back into service. Mr. Ryan said about 60 vessels were sailing the Great Lakes this December, more than twice the number in 1984.
Carriers complain that Coast Guard resources have not been adequate in the Great Lakes to keep open critical shipping lanes. Part of the problem is that the cutter Mackinaw, a 290-foot 10,000-horsepower Polar class icebreaker, is in the yards for repair and remodeling, and will not be available until spring.
Although many of the ore carriers, which are larger than most ocean-going ships, are able to push through the ice, they are slowed to two or three miles an hour, as against their normal cruising speed of about 15 miles an hour.
 
'Cutting Through Velcro'
''It's a little bit like cutting through Velcro,'' said Lieut. Pat Dietrich, the operations duty officer with the Coast Guard Group Milwaukee, which oversees ice operations on Lake Michigan. ''You can move, but not very easily.'' With a crew of 27, the Joseph L. Block left her berth at Inland Steel late Tuesday, delayed nearly six hours because cold had fouled the machinery used to unload the taconite pellets away from the boat. Almost as soon as she passed the breakwater, the boat ran into ice, although much of it was just a thin glaze on the top of the waters off Chicago.
As the Block churned forward at full speed, the ice made a kind of tinkling sound, like the breaking of crystal, as it was pushed aside by the blunt bow.
Spray off the lake had already draped the decks and masts with a coating of ice, five inches thick in places and twisted into surreal sculpture by the wind. First Mate Tom Martineau estimated there was 350 tons of ice dragging on the ship.
To reduce further ice buildup, and stay out of the wind, the Block hugged the Lake Michigan shoreline, keeping four to five miles off as she pressed northward. At Rock Island Passage, she headed northwest into Green Bay, on the final sprint into Escanaba, and immediately ran on to the thick sheet ice.
On the bridge, Captain Carlton and Mr. Martineau played searchlights over the seascape, boring through the night to find the chalky tracks gouged in the ice by the passage earier of other boats. While the carrier's two diesel locomotive engines were running at full power, the Block made barely eight miles an hour, or just more than half its cruising speed of 14.5 miles an hour.
Down below, crew members wondered if the boat would make port in Escanaba before the local taverns closed at 1:30 A.M. ''I could use a highball,'' said Patrick LaFreniere, a sailor who began working the lake boats in 1952. ''But I'm going to tell the bartender that I don't want any ice. I've seen enough ice the last week.''

HEADLINE: Call Sugar Complaints Just Sour Grapes

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In ''Uncle Sugar, Uncle Milk'' (editorial, Dec. 12), you uncritically accept candy industry complaints about sugar policy. What's worse, you assume that candy manufacturers are reliable spokesmen for consumer concerns. 
You state that United States candy makers pay twice the world price for the sugar and corn sweeteners in candy canes. In fact, the corn syrup used is selling at less than the world price of sugar.
A more serious error is the assertion that jacked-up sugar prices cost United States consumers $3 billion a year. That assumes lower sugar costs get passed through to consumers.
Most sugar is consumed in processed foods. In a typical candy bar the sugar costs just over a penny. If sugar were free, would manufacturers sell candy bars for 44 cents? Processors like the candy companies typically do not pass along savings on sweeteners to the consumer - a fact readily demonstrated in Department of Agriculture statistics.
In 1980, there was no sugar program and consumers paid 43 cents a pound for sugar. Today, consumers pay about 40 cents a pound. If sugar prices had simply kept pace with inflation, the price would be more than 61 cents a pound.
But major sugar-using processors, among the most profitable companies and industries in the United States, are beefing about sugar prices. Where's the beef?

BYLINE: By William Safire

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
My first inkling that untruthfulness had become tolerable in the Bush Administration came when I inquired why no high-level official was being sent by the U.S. to the Sakharov funeral.
The Vice President was prepared to go; the Secretary of State was already in Europe; yet Mr. Bush chose to send only our resident envoy. A spokesman explained to me - on background - that the Sakharov family wanted it that way.
That was patently untrue; Yelena Bonner would hardly ask that we not make a fuss over her dead husband lest a major expression of respect embarrass Mr. Gorbachev. Mr. Bush chose to downplay our concern for human rights; just as troubling was a decision to fake the reason. 
The next evidence was Secretary of State Baker's volunteered remark, on live television Dec. 10, that since the massacre at Tiananmen Square the recent Scowcroft-Eagleburger trip to China was ''the first time we've had high-level United States officials go to the People's Republic of China.''
A week later, when CNN disclosed that Mr. Scowcroft had been dispatched to Beijing secretly only a few weeks after the massacre, we learned that Mr. Baker's assertion had been untrue - not an inaccuracy or a misstatement, but a statement made with intent to mislead.
Why did this experienced Washington hand so cavalierly jeopardize faith in the State Department's good word? The answer he gave yesterday was ''I was trying to protect the confidentiality of a classified Presidential mission.'' If he did mislead Americans, he added winningly, ''I only misled them for seven days.''
That's not the way it works in the real world of protecting secrets. With a life in danger - as when a hostage has a gun to his head - a lie is morally defensible. But government officials have no business lying about the public's business, even in the name of national security. Instead, they have the obligation to refrain from saying all they know.
The duty to conceal embraces no right to lie. In prospective military strikes, a zipped lip is respected. In economic affairs, if any Treasury Secretary is asked to confirm rumors about a devaluation planned for the next day, he is obligated to keep his mouth shut lest speculators profit at taxpayers' expense.
The proper answer is not merely a refusal to answer, which seems to confirm, but an aggressive ''What kind of dumb question is that? You know we never discuss such things.''
James Baker has long had the rules of media engagement pasted in his hymnbook. In this China-trip case, he foolishly sought to avoid political embarrassment by pretending the President did not break his word about eschewing high-level exchanges with Chinese leaders.
Maybe he thought nobody would find out about the first trip six months ago, a gamble that obviously failed to get results; the Secretary now knows he blundered like the rankest amateur. ''I could simply have no-commented,'' he finally admitted in Haigspeak, ''which is what I should have done.''
George Bush compounded the erosion of trust by getting tricky about the word ''exchange.'' Asked inaccurately if he had not pledged no contact with Beijing, he pounced on a narrow interpretation of his word: ''I said no exchange,'' he replied triumphantly, as if his dispatching of an envoy halfway around the world escaped the meaning of exchange.
That's like the President saying he had spoken to us with his fingers crossed. Churchill used to say, ''Nothing rankles like a trick''; Mr. Baker and Mr. Bush have confused the need to keep one's mouth shut about diplomatic initiatives with the inclination to mislead to cover up embarrassments; the first protects secrets, the second subverts Presidencies.
White House aides expect the departures from truth on China to be redeemed by free passage to the dissidents Fang Lizhi and wife and the unjamming of V.O.A. (both already negotiated), as well as amnesty for all nonviolent demonstrators (a sticking point). After aggressive acquiescence in secret produces results, Mr. Bush believes his finger-crossing will be forgiven. He is mistaken; a reputation for duplicity clings.
This poetic justice just in: ''Essay'' has learned secondhand that Secretary Baker has been telling selected pundits and reporters - off the record - that he opposed the Scowcroft trips. Ironically, of all the Bush men involved in the kowtowing to Deng, it is James Baker - in publicly defending what he privately whispers he opposed - whose credibility has been most besplattered and whose reputation for shrewdness has been most muddied.

HEADLINE: 2 Peaceful Magazines Wage War in Vermont

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRISTOL, Vt., Dec. 20

 BODY:
There are, predictably, trees dressed in brilliant displays of fall foliage on the covers of both magazines. Inside, the pages of both are filled with soothing editorial and pictorial tributes to the beauty of Vermont.
Outside the covers, however, a snappish dispute between the editor of Vermont Life, a state-owned magazine, and the publisher of Vermont Magazine, a private publication, has become contentious enough that both the Secretary of Development and the Attorney General have stepped in to referee.
The war of words began after David Sleeper, publisher of the two-issue-old Vermont Magazine, asked the Vermont Agency of Development and Community Affairs, which is publisher of Vermont Life, to allow him to rent the magazine's subscription list, arguing that it is a public document. 
His request prompted Thomas Slayton, editor of Vermont Life, to say, ''It suggests to me they're getting little desperate,'' a remark that infuriated Mr. Sleeper.
 
Remark Upsets Publisher
''What disturbed me was a member of the development agency making idle and damaging speculation about our financial condition,'' Mr. Sleeper said. ''Soon after his comments appeared, we heard from several of our advertisers asking if it were true. In fact, we're in great shape.''
But Mr. Slayton said the remark about Mr. Sleeper was meant to be ''more a statement about his behavior than about the financial health of his magazine,'' adding, ''I obviously have no knowledge of his finances.''
By the standards of most media empires, this dispute has to be rated the Battle of the Midgets. Vermont Life, one of the grande dames of state-owned magazines, was first published in 1946. It now has a circulation of 110,000; 80 percent of its 90,000 subscribers live out of state.
In recent years because of rising production and mailing costs, Vermont Life has been losing money, provoking debate among members of the advisory board over whether the magazine should accept advertising.
In the early years, the quarterly magazine took an overtly come-hither promotional stance, designed to lure businesses and homeowners to an underdeveloped state. Although that message has shifted as the state's economic circumstances have improved, the pages, for the most part, remain dedicated to the scenic glory of Vermont: cows grazing on hillsides, white church spires rising above snow-covered villages.
Vermont Magazine, the bimonthly newcomer, paired its premier issue with a marketing campaign that included distributing 10,000 free copies at country inns, in addition to the 35,000 copies it sold to subscribers and on newstands.
Like Vermont Life, Vermont Magazine is primarily circulated out of state; also like Vermont Life, it devotes much of its space to Morgan horses, tips on where to ski and profiles of local craftsmen. Still, Mr. Sleeper believes that his editorial mission differs in one very significant way.
''We're different because we are independent of state government,'' he said. ''We can make independent judgments; there is no topic we shy away from. We can do political profiles, we can talk about where state programs have failed, and the only people we report to is ourselves and our readers.''
Mindful of that difference and convinced that he is not a direct competitor of Vermont Life, Mr. Sleeper professes not to be dismayed that he has failed three times to get his rival's subscription list. The most recent rejection came this fall, from Jeffrey Francis, the new Secretary of Development, with a supporting ruling from the Attorney General's office.
''We're already renting a million names a year,'' Mr. Sleeper said. ''Frankly, we're not convinced that the Vermont Life list would be all that useful to us. A lot of those names are in far-flung places like Arizona. It just isn't that big a deal.''
Mr. Slayton said he, too, was ready to bury the hatchet. ''I don't quarrel well,'' he said. ''Besides it's not a good thing for two magazines promoting sweetness and light in Vermont to be fighting with each other.''

HEADLINE: Illegal Salvadorans Fight Poverty, Winter and Fear on L.I.

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL

DATELINE: HEMPSTEAD, L.I., Dec. 24

 BODY:
Living 10 to 12 in a house, working as landscapers, dishwashers and maids, tens of thousands of Salvadorans are struggling to survive on Long Island, having traded the violence of their homeland for the uncertainty of life as undocumented aliens.
Estimates of the number of Salvadorans living on Long Island range from 60,000 to more than 80,000, giving the area one of the largest Salvadoran populations in the country after California, Texas and Washington, D.C. Social workers and others say the influx has created an underground of illegal workers who snap up unskilled service jobs for little pay.
At the same time, the wave of people arriving without money or work is straining the communities in which they settle. Increasing numbers of Salvadorans are homeless, walking the streets of several towns or huddling in makeshift lean-tos in wooded areas. And, social workers say, more and Salvadorans are becoming alcoholics as their hope turns to despair. 
This winter, as a new wave of Salvadorans arrives after the most recent round of violence in their homeland, joining Guatemalans, Nicaraguans and other Central Americans who have settled here, the Federal Immigration and Naturalization Service has begun a quiet crackdown on undocumented aliens and the people who hire them. #26 Job Seekers Arrested In September, the immigration service arrested and began deportation proceedings against 26 Salvadorans looking for day jobs in front of a delicatessen in Glen Cove. Recently, church workers and Salvadorans say, immigration officials have raided several factories and arrested workers.
Glen Cove is considering an ordinance that would make it a crime for illegal aliens to solicit work on the streets of the city. ''They're taking jobs away from people who are documented in this town, and they're not paying taxes,'' said Jeanne Henderson, a spokeswoman for Glen Cove. ''It's just not the American way.''
In 1979, the Salvadoran community on Long Island was relatively small, said Kenneth Lederer, the executive director of the Central American Refugee Center, a legal advocacy group. But since 1982 or so, the numbers have been rising steadily. In the last year, Mr. Lederer said, ''we've seen a steady increase that reflects the increase in fighting in El Salvador.''
The immigrants arrive almost daily, often after a long journey to reach the United States border and then a trip by bus or air to Long Island. They come to Long Island because they know or have heard of others who live here.
The Salvadorans tend to settle in more urban areas, in places with a Spanish-speaking population or near transportation hubs, where trains and buses make it easier to travel for work. There are more than a dozen areas on Long Island, mostly in Nassau County, where several thousand Salvadoran immigrants are living. In some areas, there are Salvadoran grocery stores; in Hempstead village, there are half a dozen Salvadoran restaurants.
 
Many From Rural Provinces
In some parts of Westbury, Hempstead and Glen Cove, where most of the Salvadorans live, there are large pockets of people from the eastern, more rural, provinces of El Salvador. Many people came from the same two towns - Poloros and Concepcion de Oriente, both in La Union. Many cannot read or write, even in Spanish.
Many Salvadorans, like Juan Carlos Murillo, say they fled their country because the political situation became intolerable.
Mr. Murillo, who is 22 years old, said that when he was a university student in 1985, the Salvadoran Government tried to force him to join the army. He avoided it after his family paid a $300 bribe - far more than a month's salary - but he was warned that the next time, he would have to enlist.
Mr. Murillo said his family's small store to the north of San Salvador was destroyed in the recent fighting, and they have nothing. ''They are hoping I will help out,'' he said, ''but it's hard.'' Mr. Murillo worked as a landscaper this summer and fall, earning $40 a day for up to 10 hours of work, but the season is over, and now he is unemployed. ''I'm trying to get a job,'' he said. ''Anything is welcome.''
Mr. Murillo is relatively lucky. He lives with about 15 others in a group home in Nassau County for Salvadorans, one of several set up by the Interfaith Nutrition Network. This season, a Christmas tree full of lights and ornamental animals and a sign saying ''Peace'' adorns the house. But others are not so fortunate. In an area where high prices are driving even middle-income people away, housing is harder still for people who have nothing. Many Salvadorans live in temporary group homes; many carve out tiny sections of apartments shared by a dozen or more people. Increasingly, there are homeless Salvadorans.
''By and large, they're living in houses and apartments that are vastly overcrowded,'' Mr. Lederer said. Sometimes, he said, people take turns in the same bed, each renting an eight-hour shift.
 
Sleeping on Church Steps
Church workers and people who run group homes say they try never to turn anyone away. But a new influx of people, with more expected because of recent surges of violence, is straining their resources.
''We've had people sleeping outside on the steps at times,'' said Josephine Miscioscia, the parish outreach director at St. Patrick's Roman Catholic Church in Glen Cove. ''We've had people sleeping in vans that have been parked nearby.
Sister Joan Staudohar, who runs a home for Salvadoran women and their children in Nassau County, said it was always filled to capacity. ''Just last week I had four calls to take a woman and child,'' she said.
Many Salvadorans interviewed said that all they wanted was a job. But most of them arrived after 1982 - too late to qualify for amnesty under the 1986 immigration law -and it is illegal for anyone to hire them. And work is harder to come by. Jobs are becoming scarcer as more people come in, and employers are wary of hiring undocumented people.
 
Jobs and Law Both Tighten
''The market has tightened,'' Ms. Miscioscia said. ''The immigration law against people hiring has become quite strict, and the more people come, the more saturated is the market for unskilled jobs.''
Mateo Gomez, who left San Salvador two years ago, when he was 22, and now works for Sanctuary, the support network for refugees, said: ''There are a lot of people coming to Long Island, and everyone's competing for a job. It's much harder.''
Those Salvadorans who do work invariably get temporary jobs: in factories, landscaping concerns, fast-food restaurants and people's houses, cleaning or caring for children. They get the jobs through referrals and, sometimes, through soliciting on the street.
''They've been advantageous to the local community,'' said Steven Valli, the human services coordinator for the Church of St. Brigid in Westbury. ''If the Salvadorans were not in Glen Cove, grass would not get cut, buildings would not get built and houses would not get cleaned.''
 
I.N.S. Raids Sidewalk
Every morning in Glen Cove last summer and fall, as many as 100 Salvadorans gathered in front of a delicatessen on Cedar Swamp Road to solicit day jobs as landscapers. After some of the storekeepers on the street complained, the Mayor of Glen Cove, Donald DeRiggi, telephoned the Immigration and Naturalization Service, which arrested 27 of the men on the sidewalk. They were released pending deportation proceedings against 26 of them.
The Mayor then proposed an ordinance that would make it illegal for five or more people to gather on a street to seek employment. When people objected by saying it violated the right to free assembly, he proposed another ordinance, which would prohibit undocumented aliens from soliciting employment on Glen Cove's streets.
There is no vote scheduled on the ordinance, said Ms. Henderson, the city's spokeswoman, adding that the debate itself seems to have put an end to the Salvadorans' visibility in the city. ''Just the threat of an ordinance moved the beehive somewhere else,'' she said.
 
Documentation Not Likely
''I sympathize totally with why they're here,'' she added. They're running from a terrible situation. But they're going to have to be documented like everyone else.''
But, Salvadorans say, it is unlikely that most of them will get documentation. Yanira Lopez, co-director of the Long Island chapter of the Central American Refugees Committee, said that because the United States treats most Salvadorans as economic refugees, not political refugees. only about one in a hundred are eventually granted political asylum.
Mrs. Lopez, who said she left her home in San Salvador when the Government began killing and arresting members of her church group, said: ''It's almost every single family who has lost someone or who has had someone jailed. People say that if you stay, you'll be killed.''
Speaking of the immigration service, Mr. Gomez said: ''The I.N.S. has closed the door on the Salvadoran people. We're not recognized, we can't get medical care, we can't go to school, we can't get a work permit, and it's very hard to get a job.''
Because they are undocumented, the Salvadorans are not entitled to social services, other than emergency medical care, and some are afraid to go even for that. The network of church and religious groups, around which many of the Salvadorans' lives revolve, try to fill in the gaps.
 
Escaping Both Armies
Like many churches in areas with a high concentration of Salvadoran and other Central Americans, Our Lady of Loretto Roman Catholic Church in Hempstead helps with food, clothing, counseling and classes in English. Every Sunday, the pastor, the Rev. James K. Bogert, presides over the largest Spanish-speaking mass in Nassau County, with more than 1,000 people attending.
Father Bogert said that despite the difficulties of life here, many Salvadorans feel that they had no choice. ''Most are single young men who come to escape being drafted into the Army or by the guerrillas, and they clearly feel that they're coming to something better,'' he said.
Mrs. Lopez said: ''The difference is that here, you know your life is safe. It's not that this is the best place for us. It's that if we stayed in Salvador, we could be dead.''

HEADLINE: At B. Altman, Christmas but No Santa

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO

 BODY:
Santa Claus skipped over the B. Altman and Company department store in midtown Manhattan yesterday. In fact, he did not appear once during the entire Christmas shopping season. He had been cut from the budget.
''This totally ruined my Christmas,'' said Periwinkle Sedigh, 24 years old, a cosmetics saleswoman from Bayside, Queens. ''I thought there would at least be a Santa here.'' 
Such gloom could be found throughout the 124-year-old department store, which for the last month has been holding a going-out-of-business sale, prompted by a Federal Bankruptcy Court decision last fall.
And because of austerity measures enacted by the court-appointed liquidators, this last Christmas at B. Altman will probably be remembered as the Christmas without a Santa, as well as the Christmas without a Christmas party, a Christmas bonus or Christmas music.
 
'Maybe a Funeral March'
''I don't want to hear Christmas carols now - it wouldn't be appropriate,'' said Brian Rice, a merchandise manager at the store. ''Maybe a funeral march instead.''
After weeks of reduced prices, much of the store's merchandise had disappeared by yesterday. Some floors were virtually vacant except for naked clothes racks and empty glass cases. Other areas had goods, like bathroom scales and sheets, scattered on the floor as if the area had been ransacked.
And throughout the store, signs were posted everywhere. They stated the obvious: ''Going Out of Business'' or ''Closing Our Doors Forever.''
The store did retain its famous winter window displays, but they did little to bring holiday cheer to the store's 500 employees, many of whom said they felt tradition-bound to work on Christmas Eve. #46 Years on the Job ''This is the worst thing that has ever happened to me,'' said Ruth Fleischer, a clerk in the store's silverware department who has worked for the company for 46 years.
''The fact that a lot of these people are going on unemployment - that's sad,'' said Philip Weber, 55, of Dobbs Ferry, who works in the store's estate-jewelry department.
The 13-story landmark building, at Madison Avenue and 34th Street, is expected to close late next week. Five of B. Altman's six stores in the New York region will also close.
''It's very upsetting,'' said Edward A. Granito, 57, a furniture manager from Whitestone, Queens, who has worked for the company for 39 years in Manhasset, L.I., and in Manhattan. ''It's really awful to see a store go down like this.''
 
Laughing Over Its Demise
''I came in today on my day off just so I could say I spent the last Christmas Eve,'' he added. ''I've spent every Christmas Eve here.''
Not everyone, however, was mourning the store's passing. One person was actually laughing over its demise. ''It feels wonderful,'' said William C. Muncy of BCF Inc. ''I'm the liquidator.''
Many customers also seemed oblivious to the employees' sentiments. They were too busy scavenging. ''I'm here for specials, but it seems like they are all gone,'' said Gina Dorantes, 22, a medical assistant from Jackson Heights, Queens, who bought an $85 blanket for about $50.
''I'm looking for a blender,'' said Anthony Pietropinto, 51, a psychologist from Greenwich Village. ''It's hard to find.''
 
Gentility and Conservatism
Founded by Benjamin Altman, a merchandiser, philanthropist and art collector, the store has long had a reputation for gentility and conservatism. B. Altman officials would not say on what day the sale would end, but they indicated that it probably would be on Saturday.
But the store might be left open for employees for a few more days. A public auction for many of the store's most expensive items - like pianos and paintings - will be in January.
One of the store's most popular attractions, its restaurant, Charleston Gardens, closed two days ago. ''My mother used to take me to lunch there,'' said Mr. Weber.
''Everyone is a little sad and nostalgic,'' said Adriana A. Kyzyk, 27, a sales manager. ''This store goes back to the days of the carriage trade and old New York.'' #1700 People Unemployed And, as might be expected under the conditions, complaints about service were common. ''These are people who, in some cases, after 30 or 40 years are losing their jobs,'' said Bernice Berman, an assistant store manager. ''So they're not in the best Christmas spirit.''
In the last few days, some employees have been entertaining themselves by circulating two poems that vent their ire at the L. J. Hooker Corporation, which bought the department store chain in 1985.
Many of them suspect that B. Altman, which has a debt of more than $15 million, was forced into bankruptcy because of a leveraged buyout gone awry. The closings are expected to leave more than 1,700 people unemployed nationwide.
One poem, written by the men's department manager, Jim Gettens, begins:
 
''It's a sad time for all as we play our last show,
And our last ''Altman's Christmas'' seems so full of woe.
The management's changed now, they're all so aloof
Just ask for assistance if you need any proof!
And it ends with:
 
''It's funny but Christmas just won't be the same.
It's only a store but what a proud name.
The years that we spent here will all be remembered.
The friends we have made; the people we've tendered.
To all who have made it so nice to have worked here,
This verse just says THANK YOU and gives you three CHEERS!
Be proud of the parts you all had to play
And try to forget the abominable way
That B. Altman's was forced to fade out of sight!
''Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good night.''

HEADLINE: Board of Estimate Approves Fordham Plan to Sell Site at Lincoln Center

BYLINE: By ARNOLD H. LUBASCH

 BODY:
A plan for Fordham University to sell part of its Lincoln Center campus to a commercial housing developer has been approved by New York City's Board of Estimate.
Before voting on Thursday night, the board heard Fordham officials stress their view that selling the site to the developer for $16.5 million was essential to obtain money so the university could build affordable housing for students.
Several community representatives opposed the sale, contending that it would bring more congestion into the area and would violate Lincoln Center's original urban renewal plan, which allowed Fordham to obtain the site in the first place. 
Fordham's president, the Rev. Joseph A. O'Hare, headed the university officials who urged the board to allow the sale to proceed by changing the urban renewal restrictions on commercial construction. He said that the restrictions were supposed to continue until 1997, that they were never meant to be permanent and that the university merely proposed ''accelerating the time period.''
 
Affordable Student Housing Urged
''We recognize the concerns of the community,'' he said, noting that the developer's plan has been modified, reducing the size of the apartment building to be constructed and increasing the open space adjoining it. He said the lack of affordable housing for students in New York City ''justifies the lifting of these restrictions.''
Among those opposing the Fordham proposal were Ruth W. Messinger, who represents the West Side in the City Council and is to become the Borough President of Manhattan, and Assemblyman Jerrold Nadler of Manhattan.
Ms. Messinger said she supported Community Board 7, which opposed the proposal. She said that she understood Fordham's position that the university needs to meet the residential needs of students, but that ''serious studies'' were needed on the best ways to proceed.
Mr. Nadler, saying the proposal ''abrogates the intent'' of the urban renewal plan, said he found it ''distressing'' to finance a dormitory by building luxury housing on a site from which low-income tenants had been evicted to make room for an educational institution. #41-Story Apartment Tower Under the urban renewal plan for Lincoln Center, most of the two blocks at the southern side of the site was set aside for Fordham, which bought the land and built academic buildings there. Fordham recently applied for permission to alter the original plan's restrictions so that it can sell a small portion of the site to the developer.
The developer, the Carol Management Corporation, will be permitted to build a 41-story apartment tower on the southeast corner of the intersection of Amsterdam Avenue and West 62d Street, near another apartment building that it recently built.
The city's Planning Commission has approved the proposal for the new apartment building. But Community Board 7 has voted overwhelmingly against it, noting that the original urban renewal plan for Lincoln Center limits construction to institutions until 1997.
Fordham has said it will use the money primarily to build a 20-story college residence on the southwestern part of its Lincoln Center campus.

Japan will give tax credits to companies that import more machinery, computers, automobiles and other manufactured goods, under a plan agreed upon by Japanese officials. The agreement is a reversal of Japan's post-World War II industrial strategy. Japan estimates the credit is likely to increase imports by $3 billion or so, a fraction of the country's $48 billion merchandise trade surplus with the U.S. and $78 billion surplus with the world. In Washington, a U.S. trade official said the tax credits were welcome but did not address underlying problems in Japanese trade policies. [Page 37.] 
Economic growth may elude villages on China's coast. In the country's economic retrenchment, imposed after the political upheaval and bloodshed of May and June, the coastal regions stand to lose the most. [38.]
 
Companies
An explosion at an Exxon refinery near Baton Rouge set parts of the plant on fire, killed one person and injured others. The refinery is the nation's second largest and produces more than 600,000 barrels a day of refined petroleum products. [16.]
Brutal competition among toy makers has resulted in a difficult time for Fisher-Price, which recently said it expected to report a loss for the quarter ending Dec. 31. Production foul-ups and disappointments in new products have also contributed to the setback at the company, which is owned by Quaker Oats. [37.]
Anheuser-Busch and Miller Brewing are offering non-alcoholic beers in an attempt to increase the industry's flat sales. The whole market for such brews is so small as to be seemingly beneath the giants' notice, merely around 700,000 barrels this year, or less than one-half of 1 percent of U.S. beer sales. But beer company executives say the non-alcoholic segment is growing in an otherwise stagnant market. [37.]
 
The Economy
It's an uneasy holiday season for New York's apparel makers. The uncertainty in the garment district reflects the uncertain fate of Federated Department Stores and Allied Stores. The Federated and Allied stores account for about 6 percent of the $160 billion-a-year American department store market. [37.]
Ore carriers on the Great Lakes have been hurrying to beat the ice, which has seized harbors and shipping channels. George J. Ryan, the president of the Lake Carriers' Association, said the early winter would force carriers to leave an estimated 1.6 million tons of ore and other materials on docks. It will either have to be moved by rail, at much higher costs, or left there until the ice breaks up in the spring. [22.]
 
The Media Business
Time magazine has been shifting its editorial tone to one that is more personal and less institutional. But questions are being raised by staff members who are worried that the large debt incurred in the merger of Time and Warner earlier this year is causing the company to focus more attention on costs. [40.]
The holiday films of yesteryear have advantages for television networks and cable stations that show them. The most striking example is probably ''It's a Wonderful Life,'' which will be seen 29 times during the holiday season in New York City alone. [40.]
The problems of Qintex and its leader illustrate the risks of building a highly leveraged company. Christopher C. Skase has gone from being seemingly ready to take on the world to becoming what he himself has called ''a minus millionaire.'' [37.]

Japan Plans Tax Credits For Imports

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Dec. 24

 BODY:
Fearing that trade tensions with the United States are worsening, Japanese officials said today that they had agreed on a plan to give large tax credits to companies that greatly increase their imports of foreign-made machinery, computers, autos and other manufactured goods.
The agreement, described today after a special meeting of the Cabinet to review the Government's 1990 budget, marks a complete reversal in Japan's postwar industrial strategy.
In the 1960's, the Government gave tax credits to companies that raised their exports, hoping the incentive would speed the development of large industry in a country that was still rebuilding from World War II.
''We decided that our continued trade surplus, even though it is diminishing, required an extraordinary initiative,'' a senior official of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, which conceived the plan, said today. 
 
Other Ways Demanded
It is unlikely, however, that the tax program will be viewed with equal enthusiasm by Japan's trading partners. None of them have called for the measure, though they have demanded that other steps be taken to balance trade. [In Washington, a senior United States trade official said, ''We welcome the allocation of budget resources for an import incentive plan, but it will not substitute for a number of structural changes in trade policy that we would like to see as well.''] By Japan's own estimates, the credit is likely to increase imports by only $3 billion or so, a small fraction of the country's $48 billion merchandise trade surplus with the United States and $78 billion surplus with the world. 5 Percent of Increase Under the details of the plan announced today, companies that increase their imports of manufactured products by at least 10 percent next year will receive a tax credit equal to 5 percent of the amount of the increase. Thus, a company that brought in $1 million worth of American computers this year, and $2 million next year, will be entitled to a credit of $50,000.
The announcement of the tax credit plan came as Japan entered the last few days of its highly politicized internal struggle over the 1990 budget year, which begins in April. The bureaucratic fight was particularly fierce this year because national elections for the lower house of the parliament are expected in February, the first elections since the ruling Liberal Democratic Party suffered a huge setback in the less vital upper house elections in July.
At a series of briefings at the Ministry of Finance today, officials disclosed a $473.38 billion budget, an increase of 9.7 percent from 1989.
The most unusual feature of the document was one huge omission: For the first time in 15 years, Japan will issue no bonds to balance the budget. For years, Japan has been one of the largest deficit spenders of the industrialized world, and its longterm Government debt amounts to nearly half the country's annual gross national product - bigger, on a percentage basis, than the debt of the United States.
Over the last few years, Japanese officials have attempted to wean themselves from deficit spending. The move was regarded as a political as well as an economic necessity, because Japanese officials have been arguing that the proclivity of the United States to spend far more than it raises in taxes lies at the heart of its trade and competitiveness problems.
''You have to practice what you preach,'' Makoto Utsumi, the vice minister of the Ministry of Finance, said recently.
 
Rise in Military Budget
Government officials also said they would increase Japan's military budget by 5.5 percent, just shy of the expected rise in the country's gross national product next year. Japan's military expenditures are currently roughly equal to those of Britain and West Germany, the United States' two largest allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, but the United States has been pressing for even bigger increases to pay a bigger share of the cost of keeping American troops in Japan.
The Japanese Government currently pays about 40 percent of that cost, excluding soldiers' salaries.
If the $29.5 billion military budget is not changed in last-minute negotiations within the Cabinet, it will slip to just below 1 percent of Japan's gross national product, a traditional ceiling on Japanese military expenditures that was only broken in recent years after great political debate. Officials here denied that the slippage was linked to the relaxation of East-West tensions, or the expectation that the United States would sharply cut the Pentagon's budget this year.
The tax incentive program for imports was championed by senior officials of the trade and industry ministry, which has the primary responsibility for increasing Japan's imports, just as the ministry once had the main responsibility for turning Japan's economy into an export one.
For months, the ministry has been battling its longtime rival, the Ministry of Finance, over the details of the package. Finance officials feared that the incentive would lead to a major loss of revenue, just at a time when Japan is struggling to service its huge debt, which will take up 21 percent of the budget this year.
Yutaka Kiyokawa, the senior deputy director for tax incentive measures at the trade ministry, said the program was expected to cost Japan around $642 million next year in lost tax revenues. Not all that will come from increased imports. Some will also come from an accelerated depreciation rate, enacted to encourage companies to buy machinery and other goods more often.
 
U.S. Asks Other Steps
WASHINGTON, Dec. 24 (Special to The New York Times) - American trade officials today praised the Japanese tax credit plan, but described it as only one of many steps that Tokyo would need to take to encourage more imports.
A senior United States trade official said, ''We welcome the allocation of budget resources for an import incentive plan, but it will not substitute for a number of structural changes in trade policy that we would like to see as well.''
The official, who spoke on the condition that he not be identified, said Japan specialists at the office of the United States trade representative and the Department of Commerce had been following the progress of the initiative for months and had been uncertain about whether the Cabinet would accept it.
 
Pressure Is Cited
''We were worried it wouldn't happen, and the fact that it did is a measure of how much pressure the Japanese Government is feeling from all of its trading partners,'' he said. ''I would not sniff or sneer at $3 billion. The important thing is to get those import levels up, and any step that furthers that ojective is welcome.''
William T. Archey, vice president for international relations at the United States Chamber of Commerce, said: ''Standing alone, it amounts to a nice gesture. The question is, what is the larger policy. Clearly the move by Japan reflects some pressure from their allies, but it also reflects the reality of a very closed import market.''
In talks with the Japanese, the United States Government has called for major changes in Japan's distribution system, the country's interlocking corporate relationships and restrictions it places on foreign investment, among other things.

HEADLINE: Maine Faces Budget Cuts as Economy Sags

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: AUGUSTA, Me., Dec. 25

 BODY:
Barely a year ago state taxpayers were cashing preholiday rebate checks worth nearly $42 million. But with the Northeast's economy in a tailspin, Maine officials face spending cuts of half again that much.
While the officials say that they hope to avoid any serious disruption in existing services or layoffs of state workers, they acknowledge that it otherwise may be impossible to achieve a $67 million budget cut through mid-1991. That figure represents 2 percent of the state's two-year, $3.2 billion budget, which by law must be balanced. 
''To assume that we can cut this level of dollars without some impact on services, I think, is unrealistic,'' State Finance Commissioner H. Sawin Millett said last week. ''Sooner or later you get into programs.''
Heads of state departments and agencies have until Tuesday to propose the initial round of cuts for the rest of the fiscal year, which started July 1.
 
A New Austerity Policy
Gov. John R. McKernan Jr., who has expanded a partial hiring freeze and called for cutbacks in state employees' travel as part of the new austerity policy, is expected to make the final decisions by mid-January and present a budget-reduction bill to the Legislature by the end of the month.
Mr. McKernan, a Republican serving his second term, has ruled out any increase in state income or sales taxes.
State executives say it is too early to specify what cuts will be proposed.
''We're all scrambling,'' said Robert L. Woodbury, chancellor of the seven-campus University of Maine system.
''At this point nothing is sacred,'' said H. Rollin Ives, the State Commissioner of Human Services, whose department administers most social service programs. ''The last thing I want to do is cut essential, existing services.'' The pending cuts come in response to a sharp decline in the economy that has caused budget problems of varying degrees for other states throughout the Northeast after several years of robust growth in the mid-1980's. That growth generated such a windfall in Maine's income tax revenue that lawmakers voted last fall to return nearly $42 million in an election-year rebate.
 
Big Deficit in Massachusetts
Among the states worse off now is Massachusetts, which faces a budget deficit for the fiscal year 1990 that Gov. Michael S. Dukakis estimates at more than $800 million. Mr. Dukakis has urged a tax increase by the end of the year, but that prospect appears unlikely as lawmakers approach the end of this year's session.
In New Hampshire, Gov. Judd Gregg is forecasting a shortfall of $30 million to $50 million. Mr. Gregg, who imposed a hiring freeze in October, is working with lawmakers to pare state spending by about $18 million for the biennium.
Governor McKernan's call for spending cuts in Maine, which came after a review of state finances by an outside accounting consultant, resulted from the second reduction this year in his administration's projections of sales tax revenue.
The consultant, the Washington-based Peat Marwick Maine & Company, concluded that the money generated by Maine's 5 percent sales tax, which is second only to the individual income tax in the amount of revenue generated by the state, should continue to grow in the months ahead but that the increases would be much smaller than anticipated. Sluggish sales of motor vehicles and building supplies have been cited as the chief reasons.
The Governor ordered department heads to recommend spending cuts equal to 5 percent of their discretionary income for the six months left in this fiscal year and to revise their fiscal 1991 budgets to eliminate any growth.
Those proposals are expected to yield about $94 million in potential cuts, administration officials have said.
Some agencies are expected to be affected more than others, because Mr. McKernan has pledged to preserve critical services as much as possible.

HEADLINE: War on Drugs Must Begin on the Poverty Front

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''Drug War: Fool's Errand No. 3'' by Joseph A. Califano Jr. (Op-Ed, Dec. 8) should revitalize Bush Administration thinking on getting at the causes of drug abuse. Unfortunately, the only proposals strongly pressed by the Administration are more prisons and more law enforcement. Both are needed, but we must move beyond solely supply-side solutions. 
The scientific solutions to drug abuse cited by Mr. Califano, like substitute drugs to reduce the craving for chemical dependency and new methods to quit smoking and avoid abusing prescription drugs, are important. We need more medical and biological research. Mr. Califano has been a leader on this issue for years, and it is important that people of his stature help lead the fight.
However, unless we attack the root causes of drug abuse, we are likely to see continued record prison overcrowding - and record hospital emergency room cases, record economic costs to society through lost productivity and lost tax revenues - no matter how many prisons we build or how much we threaten punishment.
We need to focus on the problems that bring people to the desire for illicit drugs - homelessness, unemployment, lack of education, lack of health care, lack of family and, above all, poverty. There is a major gap in the President's antidrug strategy in not examining the causes of drug abuse and possible solutions. It is to be hoped that the strategy update early next year will address these issues. I have introduced legislation, H.R. 3775, to establish a commission to study the causes of drug abuse in the United States.
We need coordinated community-based efforts to address the many social and economic conditions that are at the root of serious drug addiction and drug crime. We must look at these root causes and how to plug the gaps in our national drug strategy that make our cities especially vulnerable to drug abuse and to drug crime.

HEADLINE: War on Drugs Must Begin on the Poverty Front;
Nothing Like Butter

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Judge Robert W. Sweet suggests legalization of crack, heroin and other drugs (front page, Dec. 13). It is a complicated social, political and economic issue. However, from a psychiatric perspective, legalization would be a mistake. Cocaine, opiates and stimulants such as amphetamines cause physical addiction and medical complications. 
Judge Sweet states that ''If our society can learn to stop using butter, it should be able to cut down on cocaine.'' Unlike butter, these substances cause a dangerous disruption of behavior, mood, judgment, an intense neurobiologically mediated craving and physical dependency.
Judge Sweet suggests that under legalization, ''no one without a doctor's prescription would be able to buy a lethal dosage at one time.'' He doesn't seem to understand that even small doses of cocaine can cause serious cardiac complications and even death. (Damage is especially severe to unborn fetuses.) Furthermore, as use of cocaine and stimulants progresses, the amount needed for the desired pleasurable effect increases. With increased use however, dangerous medical and psychiatric side effects, such as psychosis, depression, suicidality and violent and impulsive behavior, also increase. Italy, where heroin (arguably more benign than cocaine) has been legalized, now has the highest incidence of death from overdose in Europe and a burgeoning of human immunodeficiency virus infection.
Judge Sweet compares the state of drug policy to the failure of alcohol prohibition in this century. But cocaine and heroin are much more addictive than alcohol. And, from a public health perspective, Prohibition was a success. During Prohibition, the incidence of cirrhosis of the liver and alcohol-related admissions to psychiatric hospitals decreased dramatically. All, including Judge Sweet, seem to agree that legalization would lead to increased use; consequently, legalization would lead to an increase in the medical complications of use.
It is estimated that half of the mentally ill have had problems with substance abuse. Many patients with other primary psychiatric diagnoses attempt to treat their symptoms with cocaine, amphetamines, marijuana and opiates. Ultimately, this self-medication leads to severe worsening of symptoms. Recovery becomes impaired by addiction and poor judgment. The most effective deterrents to abuse seem social sanctions against drugs and their subsequent limited availability.
Our drug policy, with its focus on interdiction, is a failure. However, there are many options other than legalization. Our resources would be better spent on education and treatment.

'How China Works'

BYLINE: By A. M. Rosenthal

 BODY:
China has disappeared from the news, but it will be back, soon.
To start with, any day between now and Jan. 23, the rulers of Beijing will toss a few political bones to Washington.
That will be in contemptuous payment for the American desertion of the Chinese protesters, who stood up for freedom just months ago, died for it or suffer for it still in new oppression meted out to them day by day.
Americans understood fully that when President Bush sent two of his top men on a secretly carried out mission to Beijing he was reneging on a public pledge. 
After the massacre of Tiananmen Square, he promised that there would be no high-level dealings with the murderers, at least until they recognized the validity of the students' aspirations. Americans understood, all too well.
But Mr. Bush was rescued by Panama and Rumania from full awareness sinking into the American mind of two other shameful moves toward Beijing.
The first was something the Administration had never dared reveal before CNN disclosed it. The same officials had been sent on another secret mission to Beijing, only weeks after the massacre. To have announced the second mission while concealing the facts of the early one was duplicity.
While we were absorbing that, the Bush Administration lifted economic sanctions, imposed as a penalty for the massacre. American companies doing business with China can now receive tax-supported credit.
So when you read about a new American commercial venture in China you can feel a real warm sense of participation - someday you may be paying for it.
Then Mr. Bush sent the troops into Panama and Rumania exploded. China was ripe for the TV news and newspaper front pages.
Washington knows that this piece of good luck will not last forever. So it is sending out anxious signals to Beijing to toss those bones - let a dissident leave his refuge in the American Embassy, lift some martial law regulations, do something.
China will probably oblige, but it will not mean anything. The rulers our diplomats toasted with such cordiality now know that some freedom can lead quickly to enough freedom to threaten them. They do not intend to be threatened again if they can avoid it.
But American pressure might have pushed them along. Beijing held firm and nasty and in a few months American ''pressure'' turned into American submission.
Still, some kind of cosmetic payoff is called for for those missions and the lifting of sanctions. The Bush people want it done before Jan. 23 and are saying so to Beijing.
That is when Congress reconvenes. One of the first orders of business will be a bill that has the effect of assuring 38,000 Chinese students in this country that they will not be forced to return to China as long as their freedom is endangered.
The bill was passed without a dissenting vote. Mr. Bush promptly vetoed it. The President's argument was that he could and would do the same thing by regulation, so no new law was necessary.
But regulations can be changed overnight by the President who issued them - the lifted sanctions taught us that.
It has become a matter of prime and political importance to pass the bill over the President's veto -quickly. For our sake, not just for the Chinese students. It will be one reply to the stealthy missions in the dark.
President Bush considers himself an expert on China. ''I know how China works,'' he assures us.
No, in respect, he does not. He knows something about how the thin top layer of Chinese Communists work, or how they want us to think they work - proud, powerful, mysterious.
But they are not China any more than Ceausescu was Rumania or those other dictators, hardly remembered already, were Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary or East Germany.
Somehow the President and the geopoliticians who advise him cannot see that there is no mysterious Orient, just a lot of people who want what other people want. A decent life under freedom, that is all.
Chinese students and Chinese workers, throughout the country, showed this spring that they knew what they wanted and would struggle for it, even before most of the nations of Eastern Europe did.
How can Mr. Bush have forgotten their passion, so soon?
One day, not too distant, the Chinese will show again what they want. They do know how China works.

HEADLINE: Asbestos Costs Give Schools Hard Choices

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW CANAAN, Conn.

 BODY:
Twenty years ago, before the hazards of asbestos became known, the steel beams inside sprawling, brown-brick New Canaan High School were sprayed with it. Though tests have shown that the flame-retardant coating - harmful only if its particles are inhaled - is mostly intact and safe for now, it is to be removed anyway, at a cost of perhaps $10 million.
That is twice as much as the next-highest school asbestos cleanup bill ever recorded in Connecticut.
The hard choices forced on school and local officials across the country, when government scientists started viewing asbestos more as a dangerous carcinogen than as a remarkable flame-retardant, can be seen in this Fairfield County town's soul-searching over the future of its high school. 
Other schools are taking different roads under Federal regulations that give local administrators wide latitude in choosing when and how to take action. The asbestos-management plans took effect on July 1, and from here to Rapid City, S.D. and Burbank, Calif., administrators, teachers and students are feeling the effects in ways that differ almost as much as the communities themselves.
In New Canaan, school officials said that although the asbestos would have been taken out eventually, it will be done now partly because of factors that have nothing to with the flaking, chalk-white insulation. The state fire code, for example, requires the school to upgrade its wiring and improve access for wheelchair-bound students. Doing that work will disturb the asbestos and require its removal.
''It's a chicken and egg thing,'' said Arvid Anderson, director of personnel and facilities for the New Canaan public schools. ''The fire code work needs to be done, and to do that work requires that we get up above the ceiling tiles and tamper with the asbestos - but after we do that, no general contractor is going to come in until the asbestos is removed.''
Under the new Federal regulations, every school district in the country has been required to write an asbestos-management plan tailored to the needs of each school.
Some schools, especially in wealthy communities like New Canaan, which is ranked as the single richest town in Connecticut by income and property values, have decided to pay the bills now and make a clean sweep of their asbestos. Other districts have put their buildings on extended plans that will remove some asbestos, entomb some safely in place and monitor the rest for decay over the years.
In New York State, for instance, school officials plan to manage and maintain in place nearly 88 percent of the 253 million square feet of asbestos-containing materials that has been found in the schools, according to the state Education Department.
Some schools, like Bren Mar Park elementary school in Fairfax County, Va., will close this spring for a year to allow for asbestos cleanup, while other districts, including New Canaan, have designed staggered work plans over a series of summers.
''You are going to see a variety, unfortunately, in schools' approach to managing asbestos even when material conditions are the same from one building to another,'' said James A. Brownlee, director of asbestos control service for the New Jersey Department of Health. Mr. Brownlee said that he sees schools in wealthier communities removing all their asbestos next year because the fear is so great and money to erase the fear is available.
 
Feeling Adrift and Alone
Officials at the Federal Environmental Protection Agency, which issued the regulations requiring the management studies, also conceded that the asbestos plans vary widely in thoroughness and quality, but stressed that flexibility and local control were intended under the law. Critics say the regulations have left some schools adrift and alone.
''The management plans you'll see across the country vary from a few sheets of yellow note paper to a computerized format for laboratory analysis, inspectors' reports and floor plans,'' said Bill Waeckerle, administrator of buildings and grounds for the Rapid City, S.D. public school district. ''The law was very vague,'' he said. ''That was a weakness.'' Mr. Waeckerle said that his district opted for a 15- to 20-year plan under which all asbestos will be removed as it starts to flake and become dangerous. Unfortunately, he said, because of a freeze on property taxes in South Dakota and because his district is not eligible for any Federal asbestos grant money, the $600,000 a year required under the plan will have to come out of the $1.4 million capital improvement fund.
''That takes away from computer equipment and upgrading of facilities,'' he said. ''But you have to do it.''
 
Problems in Remodeling
The burdens have also fallen differently on older districts. In Burbank, Calif., for instance, where school buildings date from the 1920's through the 1950's, an expanding school-age population in recent years has forced the district to remodel and expand. As in New Canaan, that means disturbing the asbestos, which was widely used in buildings until the 1970's, when it was found to cause cancer and other diseases.
''If we leave everything as it is, we're okay,'' said Dr. Richard M. Tighe, assistant superintendent of business services for the Burbank public schools. ''But our buildings are so old and we're going to have to do a lot of remodeling for the future; the problems will be compounded by the asbestos.''
In New Canaan, officials said that the town's affluence - while making the asbestos cleanup costs easier to absorb - has also led to a faster timetable. They said that under the State Department of Education grant system, towns are awarded fire code and asbestos-abatement money on a sliding scale, with the state paying 80 percent of the costs in the poorest towns and 40 percent in the richest.
On July 1, 1991, however, the scale will change and New Canaan, ranked number one in wealth among the state's 169 towns, will be eligible for only 20 percent if it has not yet finished its plans and filed its grant application. In a project that could cost $19 million or more, including $10 million for asbestos removal, the 20 percent difference could mean nearly $4 million more out of the town's pockets.
 
Wave of Summer Removals
''They didn't know how much money it was going to cost every poor little town,'' said C. J. Colman, chairman of the town committee supervising the work at the school. ''I think they had no idea what they were causing.''
At the New Jersey Health Department, Mr. Brownlee said he expected a wave of asbestos removals across the country this summer as administrators - often pushed by unions and parent-teacher associations - remove asbestos that might in some cases be safely left in place. He said he believes ''fear and panic'' are still driving many asbestos decisions, despite all the new technical information available because of the management plans, which school districts must make public.
Other officials say they believe the simple economics of inflation will push schools forward as well.
''You should not let an economic driver dictate a public health issue,'' said Zachary S. Cowan, a spokesman for the National Asbestos Council, a not-for-profit asbestos-information group based in Atlanta. On the other hand, Mr. Cowan added, ''the longer you wait, the more expensive it's going to be.''

HEADLINE: Cigarettes and Schooling

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Dec. 25

 BODY:
Anti-smoking efforts should be directed at young people with relatively little schooling because the use of cigarettes drops sharply among those with more education, Federal health researchers said last week.
A study by the Centers for Disease Control said that while other factors may influence smoking, education is increasingly important.
A 1988 survey of 36 states and the District of Columbia found that those with less education, who also tend to be of a lower social and economic status, are more likely to be smokers than are others. 
''There has been progress in reducing cigarette smoking,'' said Dr. Luis Escobedo of the centers. ''But the study shows most of the progress is limited to the well-educated.''
The survey, based on telephone interviews with 19,822 people age 18 or older, showed that for people over 35, the likelihood of being a current smoker increased as the level of education fell.
For those age 18 to 34, however, the chance of being a current smoker decreased substantially only for those with more than a high school education, while smoking rates for high school dropouts and high school graduates were more nearly equal. The study said cultural factors also may affect who smokes. For example, Utah, which has a high population of Mormons, whose church opposes smoking, had the lowest rate of smokers, 18.1 percent, and former smokers, 9.1 percent.
Kentucky, a tobacco-growing state, had the highest percentage of current smokers at 37.9 percent. The highest percentage of former smokers was in Maine, 20.3 percent.
The median figure for current smokers was 26.2 percent, meaning that half the states were above that figure and half below. The median figure for former smokers was 15.1 percent.
The study said other factors affecting who smokes include school anti-smoking programs, state cigarette taxes and the intensity of promotional events and advertising by the tobacco industry.

HEADLINE: Troubles at the Whitney, Both at the Top and in the Future

BYLINE: By GRACE GLUECK

 BODY:
The trustees of the Whitney Museum recently set up a committee ''to review the current status and consider future directions of the museum,'' but their mild language blurred the fact that serious problems are plaguing the institution, the country's foremost museum of American art.
One of the Whitney's problems is a conflict among the trustees over whether Thomas N. Armstrong 3d, the museum's director for 16 years, should remain.
Another is the museum's projected addition, designed by the post-modernist architect Michael Graves. Plans for the addition have yet to be approved by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission and have aroused heated opposition.
A third problem, laid at Mr. Armstrong's feet by those trustees who would like to see him leave, is a view that the Whitney lacks direction as a museum. Its critics point to what they consider the rudderless drift of its exhibition programs, the trendiness of its shows - particularly its market-conscious Biennials - and the lack of a substantial curatorial presence that would give the museum a more scholarly focus. 
 
Committees for Committees
''The whole thing is a mess,'' said a benefactor of the Whitney - who, like almost everyone else connected with the museum, declined to be identified. ''But at each meeting of the board, instead of coming to grips with the situation, they appoint another committee. It will end up with the 19th committee meeting choosing another committee. That has been the procedure.''
As for Mr. Armstrong, apparently a majority of the 35-member board favors his ouster. His resignation was requested several weeks ago by William S. Woodside, the museum's president. But he has refused to resign, say sources close to the museum, and he is said to have the important support of Flora Biddle, the chairman of the museum and a granddaughter of its founder, Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney. Neither Mr. Woodside nor Mrs. Biddle would comment.
Similarly, neither Mr. Armstrong nor the trustees would discuss for the record the reasons for the trustees' disenchantment with him. But fiscal problems are apparently not among them. For the last three years, thanks to practices credited to Mr. Woodside, the museum, on Madison Avenue at 75th Street, once burdened, like nearly all nonprofit institutions, with a deficit, has had a modest surplus. In 1989 its operating budget was $10.7 million.
Among other considerations, however, Mr. Armstrong is said to have alienated several benefactors, among them the collectors Jean and Howard Lipman. The Lipmans, who have been the Whitney's biggest donors of art since the founder, have made it known that they will not give the cream of their collection - works by David Smith, Alexander Calder and Louise Nevelson - because of their disappointment with Mr. Armstrong.
 
Free-Wheeling Style
There apparently is also dissatisfaction among some board members with what they regard as Mr. Armstrong's free-wheeling management style. He has told friends, for example, about the time he was rebuked by a prominent trustee for growing tomatoes in a garden on the Whitney roof and selling them for the benefit of the museum.
Another board member said of Mr. Armstrong: ''I find him very much in the spirit of some of the artwork we show that's more for fun than serious. All the people who are negative about Tom have expressed great friendship for him. He's a lovely man, a bright man, and everyone recognizes the great job he's done since Jack Baur left. But not lately.''
Mr. Baur was the Whitney's director from 1968 to 1974.
Staff members who admire Mr. Armstrong defend his record. They contend that while the Whitney has presented retrospectives of marketable recent arrivals on the art scene, including Eric Fischl, Julian Schnabel, Cindy Sherman and Robert Mapplethorpe, it has hardly neglected more established figures like Charles Demuth, Charles Sheeler, Ralston Crawford and Edward Hopper - whose work it owns in great depth - along with older contemporary artists like Donald Judd, Ellsworth Kelly and Willem de Kooning.
 
Points in Defense
Mr. Armstrong's defenders also note that during his tenure the museum has collected more vigorously than at any time since the days of Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, who founded the museum in 1931. Since the director's arrival in 1974, they point out, the museum's total number of works has increased by more than 2,000, to a current total of about 8,500. The acquisition drive has focused on contemporary masterpieces - like Jasper Johns's ''Three Flags'' - obtained through gift and purchase, along with an emphasis on the works of individual artists in depth, among them Marsden Hartley, Mr. Judd, Georgia O'Keeffe, Mark Rothko and Smith.
Paul Cummings, a former curator of drawings at the Whitney, said: ''Tom did something for the Whitney that no one else has done. He came to an institution where the family support was declining and turned it from a regional exhibition space with a minor collection into a museum with an international reputation, both through his aggressive collecting and by producing exhibitions that traveled abroad.''
Arthur Danto, a professor of philosophy at Columbia University and a writer on art for The Nation, addressed the criticism of the Whitney's ''trendy'' exhibitions. ''That's part of what the Whitney's about,'' he said. ''What people go there for is to find out what's going on. In a way it's like one of those glass-bottom boats in Hawaii: you see all that fauna down there, and that, for me, is a service.''
He added: ''I feel as though the museum is participating in the art world rather than standing outside it, but that's part of what it probably means to be a museum of American art in New York City now. I've been critical of the Biennials, but they really have a purpose, giving some sense of where the art world is heading. And you can't do that without playing a part in it.''
 
Toward a Cohesive Policy
A continuing criticism leveled at Mr. Armstrong is that he has failed to bring to the museum strong curatorial talent that might develop a cohesive policy and a more discriminating sense of its relationship to American art.
The Whitney has also been the target of critics who maintain that no definitive studies of 20th-century American art along the lines of the works produced by scholars at, say, the Museum of Modern Art have yet emerged from the museum.
''The big problem is that they have absolutely lost contact with the history of American art for the contemporary flashiness thereof,'' said one scholar specializing in American art. He declined to be identified because he did not wish to jeopardize his professional dealings with the Whitney.
''Over the last 10 years,'' he continued, ''there's been just too much contemporary schlock and too many superficial exhibitions of meaningful American artists. There has been no in-depth program to explore American art. And by that I mean a serious publications-and-exhibition program, and scholarly curators capable of doing this. There really isn't a sense that we have a national culture out there, a national visual culture. It's all New York, L.A., Houston, where the money is, where the dealers operate.''
 
Addition a Costly Project
Compounding the Whitney's troubles is the projected $37.5 million addition, which would double the museum's size. Although still in the drawing-board stage, it has already proved a costly project, entailing some $2.7 million to date in design and legal fees, and to relocate those to be displaced by the expansion. Mr. Armstrong was strongly involved with the selection of Mr. Graves, whose designs have been part of the post-modern movement away from the austerity of International Style architecture. But the selection was approved by the museum's building committee and by the full board.
Mr. Graves's first plan, made public in 1985, wrapped the new structure around the old museum, which was designed in 1966 by the respected modernist architect Marcel Breuer. It was scrapped because of strong opposition from the local community over its size, and complaints from leading architects that it violated the Breuer building.
The second Graves design, while scaled down, met with less opposition and was approved by Community Board 8. But it remained architecturally controversial and was withdrawn in anticipation of Landmarks Commission disapproval. Mr. Graves has prepared a third design, which has been more favorably received by architects. But it has not yet been submitted to the commission.
One reason is that the five brownstones adjacent to the Whitney at Madison Avenue and 74th Street, the site for the new building, have proved resistant to demolition. Bought by the museum and scheduled for razing, four of them have since been designated as ''contributing buildings'' in the Upper East Side Historic District, with approval required by the Landmarks Commission for their demolition. In addition, 10 tenants remain in the rent-controlled apartments. After winning a series of court battles earlier this year, the museum still awaits a decision from the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal on whether it can move the tenants and take possession of the buildings - a decision that could generate another series of court appeals.
 
Doubts About Expansion
Although more than $12.6 million has been received toward the $52.5 million building campaign goal -which includes $15 million as an endowment cushion - some observers say the building in its present form will never go up.
''Sooner or later the Whitney will get its addition,'' said Ulrich Franzen, a prominent architect who has designed the Whitney's satellite museum spaces at the Philip Morris building in New York and the Champion Paper Company in Stamford. ''The need for expansion is very real. But it may wind up being far more modest than the Graves design. We are going into another era. Things will be much tighter, and inflation in construction is going up by 6 to 7 percent a year. That factor, along with the community opposition and the problems of the brownstones and their tenants, will tend to minimize the ambition of the addition.''
In an interview in 1975, several months after he took the job, Mr. Armstrong said, ''What the museum basically needs is a clearer understanding of its role in supporting American art, a precise direction for its energies.''
For many concerned about the museum, it would seem, 15 years later, that the Whitney is still grappling for ''a clearer understanding of its role'' and that the committee appointed by the trustees to ''consider future directions for the museum'' has its work cut out for it.

Refinery Fire Could Raise Heating-Oil Cost

BYLINE: By RANDALL ROTHENBERG

 BODY:
An explosion and fire that damaged parts of a huge Exxon Corporation oil refinery in Louisiana on Sunday could raise heating bills for consumers, at least temporarily, oil industry executives and analysts said yesterday.
Even before the fire ignited several storage tanks, these experts said, bitterly cold weather in much of the country had begun to strain heating oil supplies and prices rose to unusually high levels.
The explosion, at 1:30 P.M. Sunday, killed one man at the Baton Rouge refinery, the second largest in the United States. It ignited tanks containing 3.6 million gallons of heating oil and about 882,000 gallons of lubricating oil. The fire was extinguished more than 15 hours later, at about 5 A.M. yesterday. 
The manager of the plant, Ed Galante, told The Associated Press that a release of gas might have led to the explosion but that the cause remained under investigation.
Exxon officials were still trying yesterday afternoon to determine the extent of the damage. ''The processing units at Baton Rouge appear to be undamaged,'' an Exxon spokesman in Houston said. ''The accident is in the storage area.''
Nevertheless, industry experts said that because the nation's heating oil supplies were already under severe pressure because of the month-long cold spell that has chilled much of the United States, the slightest disruption was almost certain to raise prices.
William L. Randol, a senior analyst with the First Boston Corporation, predicted that the price of heating oil futures would ''skyrocket.''
John H. Lichtblau, the president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, said: ''Because of the long and extreme cold spell, a tight heating oil market existed at the time of the explosion. If the refinery is out for any length of time, it would obviously continue the tight market.''
''We haven't had a cold spell this early or this deep for 30 or 40 years,'' he added.
But energy experts note that a change in the weather, particularly a warming that has been forecast for the Northeastern United States, would reduce demand and act to hold down prices. If the Baton Rouge refinery is out of commission for a week or less, the impact on heating oil prices should be only temporary, they say.
The Baton Rouge refinery has a capacity to process 450,000 barrels - or 20 million gallons - of crude oil each day. The plant, the largest after an Exxon refinery in Baytown, Tex., accounts for slightly more than 3 percent of the United States' total oil refining capacity.
 
'Full Conversion' Refinery
The Baton Rouge facility, which has historically been a training arena for Exxon's top management, is known as a full conversion refinery, capable of producing not only the heating oil and lubricating oil that were destroyed on Sunday, but gasoline, which can account for half of the refinery's output at certain times of year. It also produces jet and diesel fuels.
Two heating oil storage tanks were damaged in Sunday's fire. One remained intact, despite a charring of its shell, but the other suffered extensive damage, its roof blowing off and its walls folding in, collapsing the tank to half its height and rendering it useless, said Dave Gardner, an Exxon spokesman at the refinery.
Mr. Gardner identified the man killed in the blast as Harold Guillory, a 31-year-old employee of Vernon McKenny Enterprise, an Exxon contractor. Three Exxon employees and four contract employees who were injured in the explosion and its aftermath were treated at local hospitals and released on Sunday.
 
Dependent on Pipe Damage
Mr. Gardner said the refinery was closed, although some units were not completely shut down, to ease their start-up after a damage assessment was completed. The ability to resume refining, he added, rested on the harm suffered by a collection of pipe systems that carry oil throughout the plant.
He said the company did not know how much oil from the damaged tanks could be salvaged. Saving some of that oil could have an effect on the prices and availability of domestic heating oil; the 3.6 million gallons in the tanks represents about 3 percent of the 115 million gallons of America's heating oil reserves, Mr. Randol said.
Wholesale prices for No. 2 heating oil, the kind used in homes and commercial businesses, closed at 81.74 cents a gallon on Friday, a rise of 11.3 cents for the week and of about 30 percent during the last month. Mr. Randol said he had heard of retail prices in some areas as high as $1.30 a gallon.
What Mr. Randol termed the ''extremely high'' prices for heating oil reflected in part the low supplies that existed at the start of the nationwide cold spell. But other factors also combined to place great strains on domestic heating oil supplies.
 
Not Enough Barges
One industry analyst noted that the intense demand for heating oil in December meant there were not enough barges to bring oil from refineries to local terminals, limiting supplies and raising prices in some areas of the Northeastern and Middle Atlantic states, which account for 75 percent of all the home heating oil used in the United States.
On top of that, ''this has been a year of accidents,'' said Daniel Yergin, the president of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, a consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass. He noted the damage done by Hurricane Hugo in September to an Amerada Hess refinery at St. Croix, in the Virgin Islands, that is even larger than the Exxon plant in Baton Rouge and is an important source of heating oil for the United States.
''Then there was the Exxon Valdez, and there were several accidents in the North Sea over the past few months that damaged supplies,'' Mr. Yergin added. ''And there's still nervousness about what might happen to Soviet oil supplies this winter, because of strikes and internal problems. If Soviet supplies to Western Europe become short, the market here would certainly feel it.''
 
No Shortage Expected
Mr. Lichtblau said that despite the higher prices, consumers have been able to buy all the oil they needed. ''There have been no physical shortages, and it looks as if the industry will be able to get through this winter without any,'' he added.
Despite the cold and the mechanical and natural disasters, a rosy outlook is possible in part because of the weather in Europe, which exports refined oil to the United States.
While much of Europe experienced a cold spell in November, the last month has been quite warm, enabling European refiners to shift their supplies to the United States.
Exxon also says its other refineries, particularly in Baytown and in Linden, N.J., are capable of filling any gap in heating oil for the United States that might be created by damage to the Baton Rouge plant.
 
Gasoline Inventories High
The Baton Rouge fire is not expected to have any impact on gasoline prices. Because gasoline inventories are currently high, at 227 million gallons, prices are unlikely to rise, Mr. Randol said.
Gasoline is produced as a byproduct of the same process that creates heating oil; increases in heating oil refinement to meet increased demand during the last month have increased inventories.
What is more, demand for gasoline has been weak, down 4 percent during the four weeks from mid-September to mid-October from the same period in 1988, Mr. Randol said. Among the reasons he cited were consumer fears of a weakening economy, artificially high demand last year by middlemen who purchase gasoline from refiners, and slow sales of new cars.

HEADLINE: World Bank Seen Shifting China Stance

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 25

 BODY:
As the Bush Administration gingerly moves to repair economic ties with China, the World Bank seems likely to soon resume lending programs suspended after the crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in June, say officials of the bank, the United States and foreign governments.
To resume its lending, the bank needs formal approval from its 152 stockholders, including the United States, which holds 20 percent of the shares. The bank and Administration sources say the loans could be made as early as next month.
 
A Step Toward Approval
The Administration officially insists that its policy against World Bank lending to China remains unchanged. But the lifting of some American sanctions against China on Dec. 19 was seen as a step toward Administration approval of such lending in the near future. 
''That's the kind of talk we're hearing around the bank,'' said a senior World Bank official. A World Bank mission has just returned from two weeks in China.
Criticism of any new China loans is likely in Congress, where some members are seeking tougher sanctions against Beijing because of what they consider continued represssion of human rights.
But Administration officials plan to argue that new lending should encourage liberal forces within the Chinese leadership pressing both for a greater opening to the outside world and more respect for human rights, an Administration economic official said.
The China director for the World Bank, Shahid Javed Burki, a Pakistani, has just returned from his second mission to China since June. In an interview, he said that projects are ready to begin in areas like agricultural development, rural road building and thermal power generation.
Asked when the programs might start, he referred to a statement made Dec. 14 by the bank's president, Barber B. Conable Jr.: ''It is our hope that in the not too distant future we can resume lending to China, but we do not have a specific date.''
Mr. Conable had also said the bank would be guided by China's economic performance, not political considerations.
 
Others Would Also Make Loans
Because of the World Bank's prestige as the biggest lender to the third world, approval would encourage lending by others, like the Manila-based Asian Development Bank and Japanese commercial banks, which also stopped loans after the June crackdown on dissent.
The World Bank, which is based in Washington, has provided $8 billion to China since 1981. It suspended $750 million of loans last June.
Since fall 1988, Beijing has moved toward central planning and away from the market-oriented policies that over the decade had attracted $14 billion of investment from industrial countries, of which $3.5 billion came from the United States.
An Administration official said Washington is trying to use a promise of World Bank lending to get the Chinese back to market-oriented policies.
Last Tuesday, the Adminstration announced that it had decided to approve the export of three American-built civilian communication satellites to China, all built by the Hughes Aircraft Company, and to lift bans on lending to China by the Export-Import Bank, an agency that provides financing for American exports.
Within 48 hours of the American action, Beijing announced plans to lift some restrictions on foreign investors. It said it would provide guarantees against confiscation, give investors the right to choose the chairman of a joint enterprise and end rules on the length of time a foreign project may operate in China. Previously, all joint ventures were for fixed periods, often 20 or 30 years.
Administration officials said the reaction indicated China's keen interest in maintaining economic links.
In defending his actions both in easing the sanctions and dispatching high-level missions to China after the crackdown, President Bush, a former ambassador to China, told a press conference Thursday, ''I know how China works.''
He added that the Administration wanted to ''see what we can do, make a representation on how strongly we feel against the human-rights abuse, but see what it's going to take to go forward.''
 
Cloudy Prospects
Business representatives said that despite the recent moves by both sides to improve the climate, the prospects for business remained cloudy.
''Nobody wants to pull out,'' said Roger W. Sullivan, president of the United States-China Business Council, ''but companies are operating at a lower level than before.'' The council represents 300 American multinational companies that do business in China.
Mr. Sullivan, a former State Department China specialist, said that American business was now most concerned about China's ''backtracking on enterprise reform.'' He said that the Chinese had previously wanted enterprises to respond to market forces, but they now have upgraded political and ideological control, giving party functionaries greater authority in factories.
''Faith in the inexorable progress of China has been badly shaken,'' he said. ''Companies can't deal predictably anymore.''
Although the Export-Import Bank had been barred from making loans to China until the Administration's action earlier this week, the bank, which makes loans to finance American exports, continued to study China projects.
Since June it has made preliminary offers on four projects totaling $108 million of exports. Loans totaling $39 million are in the final stages of approval.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bad Year Seen for Primary Dealers

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Primary dealers of Government securities are winding up their worst year in a decade, and possibly longer, industry experts say.
None of the 44 firms that have been designated by the Federal Reserve as primary dealers, those authorized to purchase bonds directly from the Treasury, will disclose their trading profits. The Fed, which guards the numbers jealously, only gives a general picture of how these firms are doing once a year, generally in November.
The news out of the Fed early last month was not reassuring: Profits for the first eight months of the year were down by two-thirds from the $300 million primary dealers earned in 1988. And profits in 1988 were half of those recorded a year earlier, when the stock market crash produced a wildly successful fourth quarter for bond traders. 
 
No Improvement Seen
''People are not very happy,'' said Heather L. Ruth, president of the Public Securities Association, an industry group that represents fixed-income securities firms.
People in the business say that conditions have not improved, and may have deteriorated further, since the Fed's general report.
''This is probably the worst year since 1978 or so,'' said S. Waite Rawls, vice chairman at Continental Bank in Chicago. ''Volatility has fallen a lot as a result of the gradualist approach of the Greenspan Fed toward monetary policy, compared with the let-the-market-go-where-it-wants-to-go approach of the Volcker Fed. Trading volume has gone up a little, but it hasn't gone up much. We have too many primary dealers, and overhead is very high.''
 
Squeeze on Profit Margins
In addition, advances in high technology have given customers instant access to pricing information. Computers have made markets more efficient, but in so doing they have further squeezed profit margins.
For corporate and municipal bond traders, the picture is not much different. ''A number of firms will take losses in corporate bonds,'' said Perrin H. Long, an analyst who follows Wall Street for Lipper Analytical Services.
''Over all, the municipal business hasn't been that good,'' said Austin V. Koenen, a managing director at Morgan Stanley & Company and the current chairman of the Public Securities Association. ''Spreads are low for a lot of issuers, and the industry is still suffering from the excess capacity created in 1985-86.''
 
Shakeout Is Expected
Excess capacity is an issue that dealers in Government bonds will have to deal with as well if profits are to improve, analysts and industry executives said. ''For profits to be there, the number of primary dealers you need is probably closer to 30 than it is to 40,'' Mr. Rawls said. ''A couple of more primary dealers will be shaken out - if not in the next year, then over the next several.''
The shakeout may come sooner rather than later, Mr. Long said. Without naming names, he said that ''two major securities firms I talked to last week told me they were thinking about getting out of the government bond business.''
Aside from calculating profits and losses, little activity is expected in this holiday-shortened week.
With little economic news expected, there is a chance the bad taste left by the surprisingly strong report on durable goods orders during November, which was released on Friday, may linger into the new year.
 
'Spooked' by Increase
The durable goods number, which showed an increase of 5.1 percent, ''spooked people,'' said Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst for the Chase Manhattan Bank. ''People had the impression the economy would drop forever,'' he added. ''This number showed there is some light at the end of the tunnel. But even if activity in the industrial sector may be starting to bottom out, the economy in the first quarter of 1990 is likely to be just as soft as it is in the fourth quarter of 1989.''
Mr. Fine said the durable goods report was sufficiently strong to shift market psychology about the timing of the next move by the Fed to ease credit conditions.
Last week the Fed sent a strong signal that it had lowered the overnight Federal funds rate to 8 1/4 percent, from 8 1/2 percent. And some market participants were of the view that the Fed would move again before the December employment figures are released on Jan. 5. As a result of the durable goods report, the next easing move may be delayed until later in the month, Mr. Fine said.
Bond prices slipped in response to the durable goods report, and by late Friday the Treasury's closely watched 8 1/8 percent issue of 2019 was offered at a price to yield 7.87 percent.
 
Further Easing Possible
Bond prices may ease a bit further in the coming week, as dealers try to deal with heavy inventories of shorter-term securities.
But one staple of the year-end holiday season, erratic upward movements in the overnight Federal funds rate, is not expected to take place, analysts said. ''We think the funds rate may actually ease off rather than increase'' this week, said Maria Fiorini Ramirez, a managing director at Drexel Burnham Lambert.
''Instead of waiting until the last minute, people tend to do financing that carries them through the year-end earlier than they used to,'' she added. ''That means if there is any rally in the market this week it will be in the short end of the curve.''

HEADLINE: Order Is Shifted on Mobil Oil

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: NEWARK, Dec. 25

 BODY:
A Federal judge unsealed confidential corporate documents last week in a lawsuit against the Mobil Oil Corporation, but he withheld the order when lawyers for Mobil said they would appeal.
The company said on Friday that the reports on environmental conditions at its chemical division plants were self-critical evaluations and that their disclosure would have a chilling effect on the company's efforts to be candid about its operations. 
But Federal District Judge Harold A. Ackerman, ruling in favor of the Associated Press and a former Mobil employee suing over his dismissal, said the public's right to know was paramount. Mobil said it would appeal Judge Ackerman's order to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, in Philadelphia.
The judge admitted the Associated Press into the courtroom Friday over Mobil's objections.
The former employee, Valcar Bowman Jr., contends he was dismissed as Mobil Chemical's environmental affairs manager for refusing to go along with changes ordered by company lawyers in the reports. He contended that revisions had been imposed to minimize pollution problems.
Mobil said that the changes were innocuous and that it was committed to environmentally sound practices. Mobil says that Mr. Bowman, 47 years old, of Riverdale, Ga., was let go in an economic cutback.

Nurturing Technology Businesses

BYLINE: By Elizabeth M. Fowler

 BODY:
WHETHER the American economy achieves a soft landing in 1990 or tumbles into a full-scale recession, it will be bolstered by thousands of technological entrepreneurs who have started small companies, Robert G. Hawkins says.
Dr. Hawkins, the dean of the School of Management at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y., said: ''We will continue to rely on small and medium-sized high-tech companies for the bulk of job creation. They become even more important in recession than in expansion.'' Such companies introduce products and hire executives forced out of troubled large companies. 
Rensselaer was a pioneer in providing an incubator for high-technology businesses. ''We were the first to provide such a university-based center,'' Dr. Hawkins said. ''We started with six companies in 1980.'' Such an incubator provides new businesses with basic needs for their survival, including low-cost space, expert advice and help in raising capital.
Currently, 375 business incubators, including 52 that are linked to univerisities, belong to the four-year-old National Business Incubator Association, based at Ohio University in Athens, Ohio.
David L. Birch, the director of Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Program on Neighborhood and Regional Change, and the founder and president of a marketing consulting firm, Cognetics Inc. of Cambridge, Mass., agrees that high-technology companies can help the economy next year.
Dr. Birch estimates that about the same number of companies were formed this year as in 1988 - 700,000 corporations, 500,000 self-employed units and 100,000 partnerhships. ''My guess is the numbers would rise in a recession.'' he said. ''I don't know how many can be called high tech.''
''The failure rate of small companies is insignificant - 30,000 to 40,000 a year, however,'' he said, explaining that ''people tend to confuse failure rate with the closing rate of 500,000 or more.'' Closings occur because of retirement, death, or discouragement, he said.
At Rensselaer, Dr. Hawkins said. ''I think our objective at this school is to train effective entrepreneurs, giving them technical and managerial skills.''
The management school offers a concentration in the subject, which he calls a ''relatively new discipline.'' This year it introduced a course called Technological Entrepreneurship taken by 17 students in the spring semester and 22 this fall, working for course credit at incubator companies.
''There is value added on both sides,'' Dr. Hawkins said. ''The company gets the help of student teams and students work on real business problems.''
Sometimes the students take jobs with incubator companies after graduation, as did John Cerveny, who worked on a marketing project for Grasp Inc., a robotics company, and became its marketing director after his graduation in the spring.
The incubator at Rensselaer works with 19 companies, said its director, Mark P. Rice, who described it as ''no Taj Mahal.'' Mr. Rice also acts as co-director of the new Center for Entrepreneurship of New Technological Ventures, set up by the management school.
Mr. Rice said the incubator building owned by Rensselaer had been a Roman Catholic girls' home. ''We give space to companies at rates of $7 to $10 a square foot a year and month-to-month leases including utilities. We provide fax and copying machines and computers, nearness to the library and student workers.'' There is readily available advice from professors and the chance to take courses.
''We plug them into a network of contacts, including sources of capital,'' Mr. Rice said. About 65 percent of the 55 incubator companies since 1980 were started by students, graduates or faculty, and the remainder were spinoffs from large companies or start-up companies in the area.
''The incubator environment,'' he said, ''can mean a much better survival rate.'' For example, 19 are still in the program and another 20 are still in business, including ''7 or 8 that have moved to the nearby technological park beause they psychologically or physically outgrew us''.
Mr. Rice said, ''Five merged with other companies, and eight exist no longer,'' but only a few of those failed financially.
One stopped operations because ''a husband-wife team got divorced'' and another stopped ''because the professor who founded it died,'' he said, adding that three begun by faculty members went out of business when the professors drifted back into research laboratories.
''My goal for the incubator companies is for them to achieve $50 million to $100 million revenues,'' Mr. Rice said. ''A couple do $20 million or so.''
Last week, he was working to add to the incubator a company named Surcon Inc., formed by ''a midlife entrepreneur'' with an M.B.A. from Rensselaer.
''We are still trying to put pieces together - management team, capital and international connections.'' he said, explaining that Surcon would market a spot-welding technology developed by an area company called Duffers Scientific Inc.

HEADLINE: Africa Fears Its Needs Will Become Secondary

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NAIROBI, Kenya, Dec. 26

 BODY:
African officials say they are concerned that with attention focused on Eastern Europe, sub-Saharan Africa is likely to be relegated far down on the global agenda.
Expecting an abandonment of Africa for more emphasis on Eastern Europe, B. A. Kiplagat, Permanent Secretary in the Kenyan Foreign Ministry, a widely traveled diplomat in Africa, said in an interview, ''Eastern Europe is the most sexy beautiful girl, and we are an old tattered lady.'' Sadly, he noted: ''People are tired of Africa. So many countries, so many wars.'' 
Many African leaders are nervous that aid to Africa from the World Bank and other donors will be severely cut in order to provide Eastern Europe with more. In Zimbabwe last month, the president of the World Bank, Barber Conable, tried to persuade his listeners that the bank would not desert Africa for Eastern Europe, but few fully believed this.
 
Israel Fills a Vacuum
To compensate for an expected disengagement of the Soviet Union and the United States, some African nations are scrambling for new allies, with Israel emerging as one of the countries most politically active in Africa and Japan as the continent's new foreign economic power.
For many years, black African countries played off one power bloc against another to get more military or economic aid. President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire was put into power with the help of the Central Intelligence Agency after the country's first Prime Minister, Patrice Lumumba, was considered too closely aligned with Moscow. Mr. Mobutu, who has been thought of a stalwart against Communism, rules a huge and populous country in the center of the continent. He received $800 million in American funds from 1965 to 1987.
Similarly, the Soviet Union has poured around $10 billion in arms into Ethiopia, whose revolutionary Government embraced Marxism-Leninism in the mid-1970's.
Events in Africa in the 1970's even affected attempts to ease the cold war between the superpower blocs. Henry A. Kissinger, national security adviser and later Secretary of State in the Nixon and Ford Administrations, said the possibility of conciliation perished in Angola when the Soviets armed the newly independent Government in Luanda; the United States armed the rebel forces of Jonas Savimbi.
And Zbigniew Brzezinski, national security adviser under President Carter, said the second strategic arms treaty all but perished in the sands of the Ogaden when the Soviets switched sides and armed the Ethiopians against the invading Somalis. The United States switched sides, too, arming Somalia and obtaining an agreement for access to a port there.
 
Undoing the Old Wisdom
But in the last two years, the United States and the Soviet Union have encouraged, in some cases jointly, an end of the civil wars they had financed.
To deliver a clear message of disengagement in the Horn and other African arenas, as well, the Soviets gave First Deputy Foreign Minister Yuli M. Vorontsov, who had served as the Kremlin's special envoy in Kabul at the time of the Soviet withdrawal, responsibility for African relations.
The implications of this were not lost on the Ethiopians when Mr. Vorontsov visited Addis Ababa last month, diplomats say. The Soviets have told the Ethiopian Government that the military treaty that expires in 1991 will not be renewed. And the last Soviet advisers in Eritrea were withdrawn from that war-ravaged province on Dec. 15.
To plug the gap being left by the Soviets, the Ethiopians used historical links to Israel and a diplomatic offensive by President Mengistu Haile Mariam's brother, Kassa Kebede, who speaks Hebrew from his days as a student in Israel. They sought to reopen diplomatic relations with Israel after a 16-year break. The new relationship, cemented last month, was accompanied with promises, and some diplomats say, immediate delivery of arms for the civil war.
 
So Much for East Germany
More bad news for the Ethiopian Government came with the collapse of the leadership of Erich Honecker in East Germany. The ruthless Ethiopian security services were trained by East Germany, a contract that has now apparently ended, diplomats say. And two weeks ago, East Germany announced that it would no longer supply weapons to Ethiopia.
The changes in Eastern Europe are causing some political rethinking on the African continent.
Two countries in West Africa, Benin and the archipelago of Sao Tome and Principe announced this month that they would abandon Marxism-Leninism as their official ideology. Both countries said they would encourage private-sector investment.
At a congress in July, the ruling party in Mozambique, once a ''vanguard party of the worker-peasant alliance'' recast itself as a ''vanguard party of the Mozambican people.'' In a war-torn country where total economic output is about one-quarter of its level before independence from Portugal in 1975, the party, Frelimo, also announced some modest economic changes, putting more emphasis on small family-farm plots.
 
Pluralism Considered a Luxury
But one-party states, whether Marxist as in Angola or capitalist as in Kenya and Zaire, are likely to remain the norm in Africa.
Mr. Kiplagat, who is often put in the position of defending Kenya's one-party rule, does not believe that African countries should automatically follow the political examples of Eastern Europe. ''The major problem is internal conflicts and resolving them,'' he said. ''Before you talk about multi-parties, before anything else, these internal wars that have economic, tribal, historical background, must be settled. The thing we need is moral encouragement to resolve these problems.''
The opening of Eastern Europe to Western investment does not spell good news for Africa, either. With a well-educated labor force available at relatively cheap wages, the countries of Eastern Europe present much more appealing possibilities than Africa, where even in the best economic environment, like Kenya, badly needed foreign investment has dropped.
A decade ago, Japan, now the biggest aid donor to Kenya, had 15 commercial companies operating there. Today, because of red tape, corruption and restrictions on sending remittances overseas, only two are left. The amount of American and private investment has also declined.

HEADLINE: Savannah Torn Over Its Direction: Past or Future?

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAVANNAH, Ga.

 BODY:
To the north is Charleston, which despite Hurricane Hugo gets as much economic mileage out of Old South charm as anyplace south of Williamsburg.
To the south is Jacksonville, a sprawling paradigm of Sunbelt prosperity that is short on moonlight-and-magnolias allure but long on breakneck growth.
In the middle, here at the site where James Edward Oglethorpe founded the 13th colony in 1733, is one of the South's most atmospheric riddles: a place that admires something about each of its two neighbors but has not quite caught up with either.
Savannah, with its incessant quarrels over the virtues of preservation and growth, has always been an amiably contentious place. But these days, with its preservation movement slowing and its economic growth sluggish, almost everyone seems to have his own idea about the proper direction for one of the South's most historic cities. 
 
A Decade of Growth
''There's a lot of gnashing of teeth, but it's one thing to gnash your teeth and another thing to do something,'' said Lee Adler, the prime mover among the city's preservationists.
It's hard not to be entranced by Savannah. With its canopy of moss-draped oaks, elegant geometry of green urban squares, restored waterfront and 19th-century homes, Savannah rivals Charleston in both history and architectural treasures. Its port and manufacturing base give it a varied economy, and the city of 140,000 has had healthy growth for most of the past decade. Boosters see little cause for concern. ''We've balanced historical preservation at its best with economic growth, the most beautiful restored buildings in the country with new banks, new business, new development,'' said Mayor John Rousakis, who has headed the city for 20 years. ''If I sound like a cheerleader, well, I am, but I've got something to cheer about.''
 
A Seedy Thoroughfare
Others are less sure. Preservationists worry that Savannah's restoration movement, which peaked with its waterfront project in the early 1970's, has run out of gas. Broughton Avenue, the main thoroughfare for the historic district, has become a seedy string of struggling businesses and vacant storefronts. So far, city, preservation and business leaders have not been able to agree on a plan to turn it around.
Others complain that the city's economic growth has faltered to the point that it is falling further behind its neighbors.
An informal coalition of local residents called Renaissance Savannah in early December released a report titled ''Is Savannah Growing Senile?'' It said the city has trailed most of its Southern rivals in growth rate for the 80's. The report also criticized most of the major governmental figures, and it compared Savannah to an underdeveloped country. It is one of several reports in recent years that raised warning flags about the city's future.
''The frustration lies in the fact that the business community just is not moving forward,'' said Julie Smith, a member of the Chatham County Commission who is co-chairwoman of Renaissance Savannah. ''We have a wonderful way of living here, but people get lulled into the comfort zone and don't exert themselves to make things better.''
 
Political Motive Is Seen
Mayor Rousakis, who is one of the main targets of the report, says it is largely a political document aimed at him and his administration. Even some of his critics see more than a bit of politics in it. He is up for re-election in 1991 amid widespread speculation he could face a serious challenge.
But outsiders agree that Savannah has never been mistaken for an economic juggernaut.
''When you talk to Savannah people, they say, 'Sure, I'd like to have property values go up,' but they don't want to work for it,'' said Donald Ratajczak, director of the Economic Forecasting Center at Georgia State University. ''Savannah is a sleepy town. They haven't fought the image of being an underachieving place.''
There is widespread concern that the city needs fresh thinking but also widespread skepticism that the interested parties could all agree on anything.
 
'Step Up to the Plate'
''This town's very historic, and goes all the way back to when everyone got off the boat,'' said Merritt W. Dixon 3d, a local developer who built the Hyatt Regency Hotel here, which is the only modern structure on the waterfront and is detested by local preservationists. ''Some people don't want anything to change. I'm the only guy in town willing to step up to the plate and take a swing. This is a place where everyone wants to come up with 40 reasons why you can't do something.''
Preservationists say the city is squandering its greatest asset by letting much of the downtown decay, and they argue that buildings like Mr. Dixon's are destroying the history that is Savannah's greatest asset.
''In Charleston, the people know they have a national treasure,'' said Emma Adler, a prominent preservationist who is Mr. Adler's wife. ''Here, the economic development people see the preservationists as obstructionists.''
But even the preservationists are split into competing camps. And the crucial political force could be the city's blacks, now more than 50 percent of the population, who have no clear links to either camp.
 
New Leader for Chamber
But almost everyone agrees that Savannah could use new leadership and ideas. It may have got some of that on Dec. 8, when Alan Beals, executive director of the National League of Cities, was named president and chief executive of the Savannah Area Chamber of Commerce.
Business leaders hope his experience with urban issues will lead to progress on a number of Savannah projects instead of endless wrangling over a few.
''A friend says Savannah has been like a bushel basket of crabs,'' said Eli Karatassoss, who runs a local public relations company and who is the chamber's new chairman. ''Every time one crab climbs to the top to get out, all the others reach out to pull it back in. The way to beat that is to have a lot of crabs crawling to the top at the same time, so you know some of them will get there.''

HEADLINE: Burlington Journal;
The Mayor Still Leads With His Left

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BURLINGTON, Vt., Dec. 26

 BODY:
Peter Clavelle was miffed. Halfway through his first term as Mayor of Vermont's largest city, he was being asked once again in an interview the other day to compare himself with his predecessor, Bernard Sanders, the flamboyant Socialist who attracted international attention to this municipality of 40,000 people on the eastern shore of Lake Champlain. And it was once too often.
''Bernie was a great Mayor, I love the man dearly, but give me a break,'' said a clearly irritated Mr. Clavelle, who, unlike his predecessor, rarely sounds irritated, at least in public. 
Mr. Sanders was elected in 1981 in a stunning 10-vote victory over the Democratic incumbent. He left office last winter, having decided not to run for re-election and having also nearly captured a seat in the United States House of Representatives in 1988. As Mayor, he mesmerized much of the state with his powerful rhetoric and blunt attacks on establishment politics.
Like Mr. Sanders, Mr. Clavelle is a member of the leftist group that calls itself the Progressive Coalition. And when he came into office after four turbulent two-year terms of the Sanders administration, the most intriguing question was whether Mr. Sanders's politics would outlast Mr. Sanders the Mayor as a staple of city government.
''Is the Progressive movement as strong as it was?'' Mr. Clavelle said in the interview. ''In fact, I think the movement is stronger than it's ever been. I'm sitting in the Mayor's office; I think that should answer the question.''
Indeed, Mr. Clavelle, who was Mr. Sanders's director of economic development, has either picked up on issues where the Sanders administration left off or, in some cases, identified new ones.
He continues to press for zoning legislation that would require developers to build some low-cost homes where they build more expensive ones, an unheard-of concept in these parts when Mr. Sanders first proposed it. And Mr. Clavelle has ordered the municipal electricity department not to buy power from Hydro Quebec because of the utility's plans to expand its hydroelectric plants and in the process flood territory that belongs to a number of Indian groups. In addition, Mr. Clavelle's administration, like that of Mr. Sanders, regularly issues statements condemning United States policy in Central America.
Most observers, including Mr. Clavelle himself, would say that the differences between the two administrations are more a matter of style than of substance.
''My style is more relaxed, mellower than that of my predecessor,'' said Mr. Clavelle, a native son born in Winooski 40 years ago. ''I have a calmer relationship with the business community and the Legislature. I'm less intimidating to them than Bernie was.''
Mr. Sanders was on particularly chilly terms with local business people. Under Mr. Clavelle, there has been a thaw, although some say it is far from complete.
''He is much more open, much more available, more willing to listen, more tolerant and all those adjectives like that,'' said Burr Vail, chairman of the Lake Champlain Regional Chamber of Commerce. ''But with Bernie, you knew exactly where you stood. Many people think Peter has a more cooperative face, but the results are the same: anti-business. Inclusionary zoning is a good example.''
The complaints of the business community notwithstanding, Mr. Clavelle's most troublesome constituents may be the coalition of leftists who elected him last March.
''The coalition is just that - a coalition,'' said Garrison Nelson, a political science professor at the University of Vermont. ''It's not a single-minded group. There's the beacon-on-the-hill group that sees Burlington as a model for the world. That's Bernie's group; they love him.
''The others are neighborhood liberals who just want to improve their communities. Peter is more comfortable with those people, although he knows he has to champion the symbolic issues'' like those reflected in the foreign policy manifestoes.
Mr. Nelson believes that Mr. Clavelle's strength as Mayor will be in his ability to integrate the economic interests of Burlington with those of surrounding Chittenden County and in the managerial skills that he demonstrated as Mr. Sanders's economic development director.
''Peter wants to be Mayor of Burlington, and that's the important point,'' said Mr. Nelson. ''Bernie saw being Mayor as a means to an end: statewide or even national office. Peter just wants to be Mayor. And in the absence of some gigantic calamity or a scandal of major proportions, he could probably be Mayor for life.''

HEADLINE: School Offers Day Care For Teen-Age Mothers

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
When she was just a child, Joanna Rivas used to look at her parents and think: ''How easy it is to have a child. It must be fun.'' Now she is 17 years old, a 10th grader with a 5-month-old daughter, and she knows better.
''When my baby is asleep or happy I can go and do my homework,'' said Miss Rivas, rocking her baby, Cassandra, as her school's cheerleaders marched past. ''Usually that means I'm up all night.'' 
Miss Rivas is lucky. Her school, Jordan High School, is one of a small but growing number in the country that provides care for its students' babies.
The child care service can make a crucial difference for teen-age mothers, most of whom, like Miss Rivas, are unmarried. Surveys show that motherhood is the leading reason girls fail to finish high school. #40 on the Waiting List The Jordan Infant Center, which receives money from the State of California, cares for 20 babies up to the age of 2. Two of the students each have two children at the center. Forty more young mothers are on its waiting list.
Patricia Cannon, the administrator of the school's infant center, said she would probably be able to accommodate most of the current waiting list before the school year ends because of a high dropout rate.
The number of adolescent mothers in the United States has leveled off in this decade, to about 470,000 a year. But the proportion of teen-age mothers who are unmarried has risen from about 3 in 10 to nearly 7 in 10.
In some areas, like the Watts section of Los Angeles, where Jordan High School is situated, the need for child care programs is particularly high.
 
'Dysfunctional Households'
When the school's infant center was opened in 1983, Mrs. Cannon said, she was told that 40 percent of the students enrolled at the school had children.
''A lot of the girls come from dysfunctional households, and having a baby is the least of their problems,'' Mrs. Cannon said. ''There may be substance abuse in the home; a lot of their own mothers are young; they are living in the housing projects.''
Having a baby can confer status on a teen-age girl, said Grace Hibma, a consultant to the Los Angeles County school system.
''In some of these families, a girl reaches 13 or 14 and never receives recognition for doing anything good until she has a baby,'' she said. ''In some communities it's like a rite of passage.''
Although it is against school rules, teen-age mothers can often be seen in the school's courtyard showing off their babies and passing them around among friends.
 
Pregnancies Seen as Intentional
''The population is exploding,'' Mrs. Cannon said. ''A lot of girls who have gone through our program have come back with new children.''
Indeed, she said, a number of the pregnancies seem to have been intentional.
''A lot of second pregnancies might be by a second father,'' Mrs. Cannon said. ''They believe that giving him a baby, too, will prove their love. But by nine months many have already cut off their ties with the father.''
Ray O'Brien of the Children's Defense Fund, an advocacy group in Washington, said nearly two-thirds of all teen-age mothers are unmarried, a dramatic shift from the early 1970's when about two-thirds were married.
''This means they are on their own, and if they can't find day care and can't get back into school they are lost to the system and the economic cycle continues,'' he said.
 
High Cost of Care
While the number of child care centers at schools has increased since the first ones opened in the past decade, the increase has been slow.
Only 14 states now provide money for child care for adolescent parents at schools, said Amy Wilkins at the Children's Defense Fund.
''The largest reason is it's terribly expensive,'' she said. ''Infant care is the most expensive form of care.''
There is also community resistance from people who see child care centers as a reward and an encouragement for teen-age mothers.
But Ms. Hibma offered a pragmatic argument for care centers. ''We cannot afford to have that many girls drop out of school and spend the rest of their lives on welfare,'' she said. ''Teen mother programs are probably the most cost-effective programs we have.''

The corruption scandal that marred Mayor Edward Koch's third term made it easy to forget that he brought to city government some of the finest public officials ever to serve New York. Those who worked tirelessly for the people of New York far outnumbered the losers. Here are a just a few who have earned the city's gratitude. 
Stanley Brezenoff, the affable First Deputy Mayor, kept government running smoothly, even during the scandal. He oversaw the daily operation of city agencies with great skill, tried to tame his sometimes overbearing boss and, though a manager by definition, never lost sight of government's job: serving people.
Housing Commissioner Abraham Biderman kept one eye on the bottom line and the other on his mission: orchestrating the city's 12-year, $5.1 billion program of housing construction and rehabilitation. So far, more than 20,000 new apartments and houses have been finished or are being built. Mr. Biderman's efforts, and those of his predecessor, Paul Crotty, will benefit New Yorkers for years.
Budget Director Paul Dickstein was the self-appointed Grinch of City Hall. His clever strategies frustrated commissioners who wanted more money. But his prudence kept the city sound, and even his victims couldn't argue with his credo: more bang for the municipal buck.
Mr. Dickstein's able predecessor, Alair Townsend, brought relentless energy to her next job, as Deputy Mayor for Economic Development. She worked to keep corporations in New York and attract businesses to boroughs other than Manhattan. Sanitation Commissioner Brendan Sexton started the city's new recycling program and maintained high morale in his department. Bob Linn, director of the Office of Municipal Labor Relations, negotiated fair agreements with the city's unions and pushed productivity reforms. Parks Commissioner Henry Stern embraced his job with enthusiasm, as did Rosemary Ginty, who lobbied fiercely for the Administration during her many years as Director of Intergovernmental Relations.
Former Police Commissioner Benjamin Ward suffered from a tendency to shoot from the lip, but he cracked down hard on corruption and introduced innovative community patrol programs. Former Health Commissioner Stephen Joseph took firm, courageous stands on such difficult issues as the AIDS crisis, often in the face of vehement criticism.
Transportation Commissioner Ross Sandler and his First Deputy, Sam Schwartz, began a strong and badly needed program to repair bridges and roads. Finance Commissioner Anthony Shorris won high marks for running an efficient department.
Corporation Counsel Peter Zimroth devised the strategy behind the city's new campaign finance law. He also built on the work of his predecessor, Frederick A. O. Schwarz Jr. to produce an agreement with the Census Bureau that could prevent another undercount of the urban poor. Mr. Schwarz also calmly steered the government through the corruption scandal, providing advice to a besieged Mayor and devising sweeping reforms.
Many others have worked hard, served well and earned the city's thanks.

HEADLINE: Nuclear Industry Needs a Watchdog That Bites;
Other Options

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your bullish case for nuclear power (''Revive the Atom,'' editorial, Dec. 8) ignores two important components: nuclear proliferation and competition.
Weapons-grade plutonium is an inevitable byproduct of reactor operation, typically generating enough for 20 nuclear bombs each year in a large reactor. If conventional energy projections come to pass, in the next 50 years the world will be circulating 5 million to 10 million pounds of plutonium annually to and from reactors. This is enough for 500,000 nuclear bombs - 10 times the world arsenal of nuclear bombs. 
To make reactors proliferation-resistant would require reducing the annual discharge of weapons-grade plutonium by 80 percent to 90 percent. Incredibly, there is virtually no serious discussion among reactor vendors, nor in your editorial, to develop such diversion-resistant designs. From this vantage point, the Department of Energy's decision to pay $150 million for new reactor designs, without diversion-resistant criteria, is squandering the taxpayers' dollars.
Instead, the Department of Energy could have saved $100 million by financing a demonstration of aircraft-derived gas turbines. These highly efficient, durable and easily repaired turbines were developed by General Electric and Pratt-Whitney, as part of a $5 billion Air Force research and development program. Detailed testimony to Congress has shown that it would take roughly $50 million to commercialize this technology, using gasified biomass as the fuel source. The estimated capital costs are two-thirds less than those for nuclear reactors.
The United States holds the world lead on this extremely promising technology. In the United States, for example, advanced gas turbines could largely displace all the coal burned by utilities by using a combination of logging wastes and tree crops grown on some of the 120 million acres of classified erodible farmlands. Comparably large uses have been identified in developing countries, where biomass fuels are combusted in horrendously inefficient boilers.
Sweden is planning to use its forest industry wastes to fuel this technology, which the Swedes estimate can back out as much as 80 percent of their nuclear reactors. Sweden is phasing out over the next 15 years all of its reactors, which provide more than 40 percent of the nation's electricity.
Sustainably harvested biomass fuels would also help reduce greenhouse gases and acid rain pollutants. This win-win strategy is good for the environment and for enhancing America's competitive edge. Let's not lose the opportunity, once again, to our foreign competitors.
Finally, your editorial is misleading in implying that the Federal Government has abandoned nuclear technology. Quite the contrary, the nuclear fission program for fiscal year 1990 exceeds $700 million, compared with less than $200 million for energy-efficiency research and development and $100 million for research and development on all solar and renewable technologies. Moreover, the Federal nuclear accident insurance subsidy (the Price-Anderson Act) has been extended for 15 years, and the Senate has voted to forgive the nuclear industry's $10 billion debt for past Federal uranium enrichment services. This is hardly an equitable playing field for solar and efficiency options.

HEADLINE: Money Dwindles for Purchase of New York's Vanishing Open Land

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT

 BODY:
Long a national leader in preserving open space, New York State is in danger of falling behind as it rapidly runs out of money to buy environmentally sensitive lands.
At a time when several states are committing vast resources to protect their endangered natural landscapes, by early next year New York will have spent the $250 million for land acquisitions and historic preservation included in the $1.45 billion Environmental Quality Bond Act that voters approved in 1986.
Under pressure from environmental groups, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo is expected to propose a new land acquisition program, probably another bond act, in his State of the State speech on Jan. 3. Environmentalists, while praising the state's current pace and scope of land conservation, say that New York needs to commit at least $2 billion over the next decade or lose thousands of acres of valuable land to development.
Last year Californians approved a $775 million bond act for acquiring open space. Florida is spending almost $100 million a year to preserve rivers, coastline and other natural areas. Massachusetts has committed $105 million in the last two years to protect open space and parks. 
In the New York metropolitan region, where rising property values enticed farmers and timber companies to sell large tracts to builders through the 1980's, land preservation has become a rallying cry for civic, recreation and environmental groups.
Voters in New Jersey last month overwhelmingly approved a $300 million bond act to preserve open space as part of the state's Green Acres program. Gov. William A. O'Neill of Connecticut plans to spend $100 million in the next five years to buy environmentally sensitive lands.
''There's a tremendous sense of urgency,'' said Helen Fenske, New Jersey's assistant commissioner for natural and historic resources. ''The land we save in the next five years is about all we'll save in the future.''
New York officials and conservation groups describe their efforts as a race against suburban sprawl in eastern Long Island and the Hudson River Valley, and against housing subdivisions in rural regions including the Catskills and Adirondacks.
''We're proposing that the state look at open space not just as pretty places, but also as an economic resource for flood control, water supply and tourism,'' said Albert F. Appleton, conservation chairman of the New York City Audubon Society and a leader of the Heritage 2000 Alliance, a coalition of recreation, environmental and historic preservation groups that favors a new bond act.
The 1986 bond act provided $1.2 billion for the cleanup of hazardous waste sites and $250 million for land acquisition, historic preservation and parks.
The State Legislature has appropriated $120 million of the bond money to the Department of Environmental Conservation to buy environmentally sensitive lands or development rights to the land.
The Legislature has also appropriated $95 million to the Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation, which has used $50 million to expand or improve municipal parks, $25 million to restore historic sites and $20 million to develop 14 urban cultural parks statewide. That leaves $35 million for both agencies in 1990.
Bureaucratic delays hampered the start of the program. In an audit of the parks office's programs through mid-1988, for example, the State Comptroller, Edward V. Regan, criticized the agency for failing to plan how it would spend its share of the bond money. Parks Commissioner Orin Lehman called the report ''off base.''
 
Turning Point: the Lassiter Deal
Since then, however, both state agencies have streamlined their procedures and have earned high marks from recreation and conservation groups.
''They've done an outstanding job in the past year in land acquisitions,'' said Lee Wasserman, executive director of the Environmental Planning Lobby in Albany.
A turning point in the land-acquisition process came last December when Mr. Cuomo intervened to speed the state's purchase of 55,000 acres of Adirondacks wilderness. The state's inability to acquire the land and additional acreage before a developer, Lassiter Properties Inc., bought it in September 1988 had been criticized by environmentalists as emblematic of weaknesses in the process.
The state has since reduced the acquisition time to an average of eight months, from 16 months, partly by working with groups like the Nature Conservancy, which buys the property and sells it to the state.
The state has also empowered its negotiators to offer a premium above appraised fair-market value for properties that have extraordinary public value.
 
Playgrounds to Bike Trails
The Lassiter purchase also illustrated the state's increasing use of conservation easements, which give the public access to land and allows its owners to cut timber but not to build or otherwise alter the land.
In the Lassiter purchase, the state bought 15,000 acres outright and easements on the other 40,000 acres. This preservation tool also promotes the concept of working landscapes, where farmland and forests important to rural economies remain in commercial and recreational use but cannot be developed.
Using bond money, New York has bought or agreed to buy 53,553 acres and easements on 67,992 acres. That total includes 1,369 acres of freshwater wetlands, 10,560 acres of wildlife habitat and more than 97,000 acres of forest in the Adirondacks and Catskills.
The purchases range from the Lassiter land in the Adirondacks, the largest state land deal since the turn of the century, to Denning Point and Sloop Hill, Hudson River peninsulas that are feeding areas for bald eagles.
Parks and historic restoration projects, financed by municipalities and nonprofit organizations with matching state grants, range from playgrounds and bike trails to renovated churches and synagogues.
 
The Need for More Money
''This bond issue helped identify and quantify the preservation and conservation agenda for the rest of the century,'' said Peter R. Borrelli, associate director of the Open Space Institute, a land preservation agency.
Identifying a wide range of valuable parcels and projects also pointed up the bond act's major shortcoming: not enough money to go around. To prevent soaring land prices from eroding the state's purchasing power, agency officials were directed to identify and buy qualified properties within five years. Land values and rapid acquisitions have depleted bond money within about three years.
As the bond money runs out, the Environmental Conservation Department still has $400 million worth of properties that qualify for protection. The parks office has a similar backlog.
''We're only able to fund one of eight projects that are really important,'' said Julia Stokes, a deputy commissioner for historic preservation.
The Heritage 2000 Alliance estimates that it would cost $6 billion to acquire or restore the most important parcels and historic sites in the state.
 
Using Tax Dollars for Land
No one expects state officials under fiscal constraints to come up with that kind of money. But the state is expected to continue playing the principal role in preserving open space.
Municipalities are devoting a greater share of their budgets to open space, but most cannot afford large conservation programs. Rare are places like Suffolk County, L.I., which has spent $100 million in the last three years to buy more than 6,300 acres essential to protecting underground water supplies.
Roughly half that money was raised this year through a quarter-cent addition to the 7.25 percent sales tax that county residents pay.
Facing a budget shortfall of more than $500 million in the next fiscal year, legislators ruled out any special appropriations for land acquisition.
Several parts of the country use special taxes to raise money for land acquisition. Florida has a phosphate-mining tax; Texas a tax on cigarette sales, and Nantucket Island, Mass., a real-estate transfer tax.
A proposal by Maurice D. Hinchey, an Ulster County Democrat who is chairman of the Assembly's Environmental Conservation Committee, would create a permanent $1 billion trust fund for land acquisition by raising the state sales tax by 1 percent for 12 months.
The fund would yield about $100 million a year in interest that could be used for land preservation, Mr. Hinchey said. Other legislators and aides to Mr. Cuomo, however, said that new taxes are unlikely.
Environmental groups favor a bond act that would generate at least $200 million a year. The earliest that voters could act on such a measure would be in November.

HEADLINE: Gunmen Kill 2 Bystanders In 'Power Play'

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

 BODY:
A group of men, apparently trying to show that a drug location was their territory, fired randomly as they drove down a Queens street Monday night, killing a teen-ager and mortally wounding a pregnant woman, the police said.
An hour after the shooting, doctors at Queens Hospital Center delivered the wounded woman's baby by Caesarean section while she fought for life, a hospital spokeswoman, Beryl Williams, said.
The woman, Lisa Biffle, 25 years old, died yesterday at 2:55 P.M. after refusing to accept a blood transfusion for religious reasons, the police said.
''She obeyed her conscience,'' Mrs. Biffle's father, Hugh Carter, said. ''More important than life is to maintain a good relationship with God, because he can give everlasting life.'' 
Lieut. Eugene Dunbar, commanding officer of the 103d Precinct detectives, said the shooting in South Jamaica, Queens, ''looks like a power play.''
 
'Someone Else Is Moving In'
''The area is a drug location,'' he said.
Lieutenant Dunbar said it is not uncommon for drug dealers in South Jamaica to drive down a street and fire at people ''to get a message across to other drug dealers that someone else is moving in.'' In the last year, he said, there have been at least three similar shootings in the neighborhood.
As of last night, no arrests had been made in Monday's shootings and the police had no suspects, investigators said.
The shootings occurred at 11:50 P.M. Monday on the west side of 106th Street between 107th and 108th Avenues in South Jamaica, opposite the South Jamaica Houses, a public housing project where cocaine dealers have a thriving business, Lieutenant Dunbar said.
The slain teen-ager, Ebony Williams, 18, of 144-02 Linden Boulevard in South Jamaica, was hit twice in the head as she talked on a pay telephone at the corner of 107th Avenue and 106th Street, he said. She died at the scene.
The gunmen fired from a black 1985 Toyota Camry traveling south on the nearly deserted street, the police said. Seven 9-millimeter shell casings and two rifle shells were found scattered along the street, but it was unclear whether the gunman fired one weapon or two, investigators said.
After shooting Ms. Williams, the gunmen in the Camry coasted another 150 feet and pulled up next to Mrs. Biffle and her husband, Dwayne, 29, who were getting into a Volkswagen Jetta after visiting an uncle of Mr. Biffle who lived nearby, Lieutenant Dunbar said. The men fired several shots into the couple's car.
Mr. Biffle was hit in the left foot and Mrs. Biffle, nine-months pregnant, was struck once in the abdomen, the police said. The Camry sped away.
The bullet that hit Mrs. Biffle ripped through the aorta, spleen, pancreas and colon but somehow missed the unborn child, Mr. Carter said.
The Biffles were taken to Queens Hospital Center, where a team of surgeons delivered their 6-pound 7-ounce boy at 1:09 A.M., Ms. Williams said.
Mrs. Biffle would not allow doctors to give her a blood transfusion despite her great loss of blood because she is a Jehovah's Witness and her religious beliefs proscribe it, Mr. Carter said. Jehovah's Witnesses oppose transfusions because they believe the Bible -specifically Leviticus 17:11 - forbids the ''eating'' of blood.
Mr. Biffle, who underwent surgery yesterday afternoon, and the new baby were listed in good condition last night, Ms. Williams said.
The Biffles were married four years ago and were expecting their first child, Mr. Carter said. Mrs. Biffle worked as a secretary at the Manhattan law firm of Dreyer & Traub, and Mr. Biffle recently began working as an asbestos inspector for the city.
 
Was Headed to a Movie
Last week, her fellow employees gave her a baby shower, Mr. Carter said, and she spent the weekend turning one of the rooms in the couple's small house on Sayre Avenue into a nursery. She planned to leave work later this week to have the child. ''This was something very exciting for her,'' Mr. Carter said. ''They just happened to be in the wrong place,'' Mr. Carter said. ''It's sad, but there is a lot of sadness in this world today.''
Ms. Williams, the slain teen-ager, was an unemployed high school graduate who lived alone with her mother and wanted to attend York College next fall, the police said. She was on her way to a movie theater with a girlfriend when they stopped to call some aquaintances, Lieutenant Dunbar said. Then the shooting started. There is no evidence that she knew the men who fired at her or that she was involved in drug dealing, Lieutenant Dunbar said.

HEADLINE: What's in a Name? 50 Signs and a New Era.

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
Fifty slots on 50 signs on major roads connecting the five boroughs were waiting for official word on an 'N.'
That's 'N' as in Norman as in David N. Dinkins.
''We just need to confirm that that is how he would like it - David N. Dinkins, or simply David Dinkins,'' said Ross (No Middle Initial) Sandler, New York City's Transportation Commissioner, before the decision came from City Hall last Friday. Until then, the 50 signs were on hold. Not a big problem. The department maintains a million street signs of 7,000 different varieties and manufactures and replaces 70,000 of them a year, so 50 signs would all be in a day's work. Actually, it was all in about two hours' work last week. 
And there was no doubt, once the word on the letter came down, that the signs heralding a new mayor and a new era for New York City would get high priority.
''They will be up early in January,'' Mr. Sandler said, pointing out that the ''borough welcoming signs'' are designed so that only a new nameplate has to be painted and bolted into place. The folks at the Transportation Department's sign shop - housed in an old Renault assembly plant in Maspeth, Queens - are up to the job.
One day last week, Steve Harbeck, ''a traffic device maintainer,'' as he and his colleagues are called, was punching holes -three on top, three on the bottom and four on each side - through 18-by-12-inch metal plates, and then rounding the corners. ''It's a safety feature,'' Mr. Bruno said of those clipped corners, ''in case the sign falls.''
Each of the plates was sectioned from one of the 5-by-12-foot metal sheets out of which all city street signs are fashioned, whether they are a ''postage stamp'' - as the workers call the 5-by-7-inch time indicators that are affixed to parking meters - or the giant signs that hang over major highways. ''The biggest is on the Grand Central Parkway at the Northern Boulevard split; it's 39 feet by 12 feet,'' said James Meyer, director of the Maspeth factory, where the city's parking meters and traffic lights also are repaired.
The sign shop's blacksmith, Sam Prioleau, stood beside his anvil, bending metal strips into Z-shaped hooks. ''I designed them from scrap,'' Mr. Prioleau said proudly. ''They save the city 60 cents apiece.''
The Z-hooks are used to hang blank sign plates, one below the other, from a clothesline-like conveyer belt that carries them through an electrostatic powder coater and then into a huge oven. The coater, Mr. Meyer said, uses negative electricity to fix the white powder to the plates.
 
Official and Not So Official
In another part of the room, John Coffey ran a squeegee-like device over a silkscreen so that black ink seeped through and deposited ''Quarters Only'' onto a series of the newly coated plates.
Nearby hung a not-so-official sign designed by the workers. ''Phil, The Job Will Be Ready Tomorrow,'' it said.
''Think I push them a bit?'' asked Phil Cupo, the shop foreman. ''Every time I bring in an order they point to that sign.''
The sign makers must work fast. Lives depend on them. And in recent years, to speed that effort, all signs have been bar coded, like grocery items.
If a citizen complains that a nearby sign is damaged or obliterated by graffiti, said Elizabeth Theofan, assistant commissioner for traffic engineering, an inspector can go to the site, read the bar code and order an identical replacement from one of the shops maintained by the department in each of the five boroughs.
 
Eyes of Many Observers
Each of the five shops has about 7,000 standard signs in stock. ''If it's a life-protecting sign - 'Stop,' 'One Way,' 'Do Not Enter' - these are top priority,'' Ms. Theofan said. ''It must be up within 10 days.'' Mr. Sandler said the department has lived up to that standard 100 percent of the time for the last three years.
Besides citizen complaints, the Transportation Department takes reports from the Police and Fire Departments. And it depends on its employees, ''from the commissioner on down,'' Ms. Theofan said, to watch for missing or damaged signs.
If by chance a borough shop does not have a particular sign on hand, the order goes to the plant in Queens, where 40,000 standard signs are in storage.
But not all signs are standard. In 1988, when the Williamsburg Bridge was closed for structural repairs, the city established an emergency ferry service across the East River. It took one weekend for the shop to create a series of large signs saying, ''Williamsburg Express Ferry Terminal.'' To serve an ethnically diverse population, the signs were written in English, Spanish and Yiddish.
 
A Matter of Revenue
There is also an economic factor requiring haste in the replacement of defective signs - one that parking violators might not appreciate. A defective sign means a parking ticket is invalid.
''If the sign is missing or faded,'' Mr. Sandler said, ''the summons can't be written at all.'' A departmental survey several years ago, he said, showed that the city lost $80 million in five years.
''Budget reductions during the last four years have eaten away at the city's capacity to maintain and replace the signs,'' Mr. Sandler said ''We've lost 22 people, and that translates into 32,000 fewer signs annually.
''We think this is penny wise but pound foolish because, by 1993-94, we could be losing upwards of $10 miilion a year.''
That will be a consideration for the new Mayor - David N. Dinkins.

HEADLINE: Koch, in Veto, Discounts Risks In Computer Use

BYLINE: By ARNOLD H. LUBASCH

 BODY:
Mayor Edward I. Koch yesterday rejected legislation aimed at protecting New York City municipal employees who use video display terminals.
In a rare veto, the Mayor said he had not been shown compelling medical evidence that the terminals posed a serious health risk. He said that the bill could hurt the city's business climate, and that the issues it addressed should be resolved through collective bargaining. 
The bill requires uniform standards for the equipment, providing rest breaks for the employees and obligating the city to pay half the cost of eye examinations and lenses needed as a result of operating the terminals.
Peter F. Vallone, the Council majority leader, said he intended to reintroduce the legislation next year and would seek the new Mayor's support to ''see that city workers are protected.''
 
Possible Danger to Health
Advocates of the legislation, including municipal-union representatives, contended at a City Hall hearing last week that the health and safety of employees are endangered by regular, long use of video display terminals.
Opponents of the bill, including the New York Chamber of Commerce and Industry, contended that the terminals do not pose a risk when they are operated properly and that the legislation for city employees could lead to imposing regulations in the private sector.
Mr. Koch said he believed the issue had to be settled through collective bargaining unless there was ''compelling evidence that they pose a serious health threat.
''Even if there was such compelling medical evidence,'' he continued, ''the economic provisions of the bill, such as eye examinations on city time and city payment for eye examinations and lenses, must be the subject of collective bargaining.''
 
Wants Collective Bargaining
Mr. Koch noted that the city has been negotiating with District Council 37 on some of the issues and that the legislation ''represents an attempt to circumvent these negotiations.''
The city's budget office estimated that the bill would cost $30 million in the next fiscal year, Mr. Koch said. He noted that a chief sponsor of the bill, Councilwoman Miriam Friedlander, said the cost would be $3 million.
Mr. Koch said he was also concerned that the measure ''represents the first step toward'' regulating the use of video display terminals in the private sector, which ''might endanger the business climate and cause firms to relocate outside the city or deter new ones from moving into the city.''
Suffolk County has adopted similar legislation.

Lessons

BYLINE: By Edward B. Fiske

 BODY:
Wouldn't it be nice to receive 16 years of education - a high school diploma and a college degree - in 10 minutes for an investment of 5 cents?
That is what Lewis J. Perelman of the Hudson Institute estimates would be possible if the power of educational technology had increased at the same pace in the last 40 years as the power of computer technology.
The analogy, of course, is extreme. Delivering information is only one element of education, and there is always the matter of how much the human brain can handle on the receiving end. But Mr. Perelman has a point. 
Education has, arguably, the worst productivity record of any major industry. It is difficult to imagine that decentralized school systems and the other changes widely proposed for American schools will have much impact unless schools figure out how to make better use of the resources they already have.
Evidence of inefficiency is abundant.
In ''Technology and the American Economic Transition,'' a report published last year, the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment concluded that, with staffing levels rising and student test scores stagnant, the ''real productivity'' of American schools was declining.
A prime reason for the decline, it suggested, is that education invests a smaller portion of its resources in labor-saving technology than any other major industry. As a nation, the United States invests 2.5 percent of its gross national product in research and development.
By contrast, the two main supporters of educational research, the Education Department and the National Science Foundation, together spent $130 million, or 0.025 percent, of all spending for education on such activities in 1987.
Mr. Perelman, in a paper published in October for the Hudson Institute titled ''Closing Education's Technology Gap,'' calculated that whereas the average job in the American economy required $50,000 of investment in plant and equipment, the figure for schools is $1,000 per employee.
Actually the figure is much lower, for, as he notes, education is one of the few businesses in which it is the consumer, not the employee, who does the ''essential work.'' If students are thought of as the ''workers,'' then the investment drops to $100.
Educators typically respond to such arguments by pointing out that 93 cents out of every dollar in the school budget pays for salaries. Because their enterprise is so labor intensive and because machines cannot run classrooms, the argument goes, education cannot be automated to the same extent as other industries.
But that argument can be turned on its head. Because education is so labor intensive, the potential for improving productivity is enormous.
Education is a complex enterprise, involving everything from transferring data to the shaping of human values. Few would argue that the most sophisticated learning experiences - the give and take of a high-level seminar or the Socratic dialogue of the single student and teacher - can be automated.
Such learning, however, constitutes a small percentage of educational experience. Much, perhaps most, learning, especially at the elementary and secondary level, can be enhanced by the use of word processing, videos and other forms of technology.
Compelling evidence can be found in the fact that educators with a big stake in efficiency, notably the military and proprietary trade and technical schools, invest heavily in technology. Mr. Perelman estimates that 30 percent of the $50 billion that American employers spend annually on employee training goes into computer-based instructional systems.
''The difference is that employers and the military have big incentives to teach more efficiently,'' he said. ''Those incentives are missing from public schools.''
Vendors of computer-assisted learning systems, which allow students to work at their own pace under the guidance of a classroom teacher, argue that they can substantially increase the learning of basic skills like arithmetic and grammar.
''We can cover 12 years of learning in eight,'' the president of the education systems division of Wicat Systems, John J. Gottsman, said. ''You can spend the rest of the time on great books or whatever you want.'' Other manufacturers make similar claims.
The Congressional report called for establishing a federally supported Learning Research Institute, on the model of the National Institutes of Health, to promote greater use of technology in education. Mr. Perelman wants states to get schools to put 1 percent of their budgets into educational research and share findings through a National Institute for Learning Technologies.
Although the idea of 16 years of education for 5 cents may be just a fantasy, the pressure is on for schools to find ways of getting more for their nickels.

HEADLINE: New Jet Fighter: Risks Are High

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Dec. 22

 BODY:
The two teams of military contractors competing for a contract to build a new generation of jet fighters are finding their gamble is even bigger than anticipated.
For the two teams - one led by the Northrop Corporation, the other by the Lockheed Corporation - the program represents an opportunity to capture what is expected to be one of the few big weapons contracts of the 1990's. But it has also become perhaps the most visible example of how stricter procurement rules imposed by the Pentagon earlier in the decade have staggered arms makers, even before they confront the deep military budget cuts being contemplated in Washington. It also illustrates how the industry's willingness to take big risks to land new business may not pay off, even for the winner.
Indeed, both the industry and the Pentagon seem to have learned a lesson from programs like the Advanced Tactical Fighter, as the proposed plane is called. The industry is taking a harder line about the terms it will accept on any new project. And the Government appears to have concluded, even as it tries to tighten its belt, that in some cases it has pushed contractors too far. 
 
Policy of Sharing Costs
The Advanced Tactical Fighter is being designed to replace the F-15 as the plane that controls the skies over a battlefield, allowing attack planes and bombers to strike enemy forces. It is being built under a policy that the Pentagon calls cost-sharing. The Government agreed three years ago to pay each team $691 million to design and build two prototypes, knowing that each team would have to spend far more than that to meet the Air Force's performance standards.
In fact, each team has spent almost as much of its own money as the Air Force's - more than $600 million each - making this the largest cost-sharing arrangement ever, analysts said. Northrop's partner is the McDonnell Douglas Corporation, and Lockheed is teamed with the Boeing Company and the General Dynamics Corporation. Northrop and McDonnell have each put up about $300 million, and Lockheed, Boeing and General Dynamics have invested $200 million or so apiece.
A showdown between the two teams will take place sometime next year in the skies over Edwards Air Force Base in the California desert. The rival prototypes will engage in a ''flyoff,'' with the winning design destined to become one of the nation's standard combat aircraft well into the 21st century.
When the flyoff is complete and a selection is made in mid-1991, the losing team's $600 million - roughly the equivalent of Lockheed's $624 million in net earnings for all of last year -will have essentially gone down the drain. The winner will presumably have a chance to recoup its investment in the more profitable full-scale development and production phases of the contract, which could extend for a decade or more.
But with improved relations with the Soviet Union and pressure in Congress to cut military spending, even the winner risks emerging with a limited profit if the program is slowed down or scaled back, or as an outright loser if it is canceled altogether. The Air Force wants to build 750 of the fighters at an estimated cost of $45 billion, or an average of $60 million per plane.
The project has already hurt earnings at all of the competing companies for three years as they write off the money they poured into designing and building the prototypes. The expenditures have raised the companies' debt levels, helped depress their stock prices and diverted money and engineering talent from research and development and from other programs. The companies are now grappling with the effects of a $200 million cut in the program's budget for this year and a subsequent decision by the Air Force to try to save money in the current fiscal year by extending the prototype phase by six months.
 
'Money Out of the Industry's Hide'
''This is one example of how the Government and the Defense Department have more or less taken money out of the industry's hide in order to keep a program going despite cuts to the defense budget,'' said Paul H. Nisbet, an analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities. ''It may keep the program alive for the Government, but the ability of the industry to compete is impeded by this kind of contract.''
The contractors were all aware of the program's terms going into the competition, and chose to participate anyway, although they spread the financial risks by forming teams. Only now, after several years of absorbing the harsh lessons of the strict contracting terms imposed by the Pentagon on a host of other programs, are executives of some of the contractors beginning to wonder whether the gamble was worth it.
As a result, the industry is taking a harder line with the Pentagon about what terms it will accept on new projects. Rather than pay any price to win business that might keep production lines and laboratories humming, as they have for the last few years, weapons makers are increasingly bidding only if the economics make sense.
Over the last year or two, several of the largest contractors, including Northrop and Lockheed, have stopped bidding for programs that pay a fixed price for the development of new weapons systems. The companies say those contracts have often led to huge losses when unexpected technical problems and delays have produced higher-than-planned costs. Indeed, virtually every large company has suffered a loss on a fixed-price development contract in the last several years. The industry prefers contracts that pay a fee or a certain percentage above the cost of a program.
 
Demands for Reimbursement
Some companies, including the Rockwell International Corporation, are shedding their previous reluctance to pick a fight with the Government and are asking the Pentagon to reimburse them for losses that they consider the results of changes in contract demands midway through a program. Rockwell is planning to seek to recover some of its $100 million in losses on a program to develop the AC-130 aircraft gunship.
Many companies have simply stopped doing business with the Pentagon, citing the low profit potential. According to a recent study by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a research organization in Washington, the number of military suppliers or subcontractors dropped to fewer than 40,000 companies in 1987, from 138,000 in 1982, although other experts say the decline was much smaller. Some big companies, like Honeywell Inc., are selling all or most of their military-related businesses to concentrate on more profitable commercial ventures.
Those companies that have remained in the business are mostly living off older, established programs, many of them highly profitable. The military sales of virtually every company in the industry have begun to fall off in the last few years, and overall profit margins have been badly squeezed. The industry suffers from overcapacity in important segments like airplane manufacturing and shipbuilding. Many companies have had trouble raising capital to invest in new plants and technologies because investors have pushed their stock prices down sharply.
 
Pentagon Eases Up
For its part, the Government has been talking of becoming somewhat less demanding. The Pentagon is ending its demands for fixed-price development contracts, for example, and has slightly speeded up the rate at which it pays its contractors.
Addressing what he called the adversarial relationship between the Pentagon and the arms industry, Donald J. Atwood, the Deputy Defense Secretary, said in a speech last month that the Government would try to improve the business climate for contractors.
''We are taking steps to improve this relationship by reinstating the proper risk-return balance in the defense business,'' he said. ''It is important that we acknowledge that it is proper for industry to make an equitable profit. We want to give our suppliers the incentive to make the necessary investments in the high-technology equipment and facilities needed to develop and produce today's sophisticated weapons systems.''
But for now the industry is stuck with deals it made over the last few years, and it is continuing to pay a price for them. On the fighter jet program, the Northrop-McDonnell Douglas team took the unusual step of sending a letter to the Air Force last month detailing its concerns about ''uncertainties'' in the program's financing and asking for reassurances that delays in the program schedule would not increase the team's financial risk.
Northrop and McDonnell Douglas told the Air Force that unless they received those reassurances, they would reduce their spending and work on the program to levels sufficient to meet minimum contract requirements, and no more.
 
An Offer to Pay More
Analysts said the Air Force had offered to pay each team an additional $52 million to cover the cost of the six-month extension. But Northrop is reported to have told the Air Force that its costs for the extension will be $115 million, and the Lockheed team is thought to have placed its figure at $170 million.
Because the contracts call for the bulk of the payments from the Air Force to be made to the competitors toward the end of the prototype program, the Northrop team has spent $180 million more than the Air Force has reimbursed it for, separate from the $650 million that Northrop, McDonnell Douglas and their biggest subcontractors have put up of their own money.
Lockheed executives declined to be interviewed, but their team is thought to have spent at least as much of its own money as the Northrop team and to have similar financial concerns.
''Everyone accepted cost-sharing at the beginning,'' said an executive of a company in the competition, who agreed that the program had become riskier for the contractors. ''What you have now is not only cost-sharing, but shortfalls in funding and extensions in the timetable.''
 
Shrouded in Secrecy
The competition itself remains largely shrouded in secrecy. But analysts and industry executives say that the Northrop-McDonnell Douglas team has delivered its first prototype to a hangar at Edwards Air Force Base in the California desert and that the team's second prototype is nearing completion at a Northrop plant near Los Angeles. The first prototype is expected to be outfitted with engines built by the United Technologies Corporation's Pratt & Whitney unit and to fly for the first time in the first three months of next year.
The Lockheed team is thought to be behind schedule. Its prototypes have still not been assembled. Lawrence M. Harris, an analyst at Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards in Los Angeles, said the delay may have resulted in part to problems at General Dynamics, which has apparently been slow in building the middle portion of the fuselage. Mr. Harris said Lockheed was also thought to be using more advanced composite surfaces and avionics, the systems that control the plane's flight.
Some analysts see the Air Force's decision to slow the program by six months as an attempt to let the Lockheed team catch up with Northrop, which has been bedeviled by indictments and investigations of its performance on a variety of programs in recent years and is enduring close Congressional scrutiny over its work on the $70 billion B-2 Stealth bomber program.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Foreign Owners For U.S. Airlines?

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
FIRST there were Pan Am and T.W.A. and United and American. And now - Discovery?
Actually, Hawaii-based Discovery Airlines, set to begin inter-island operations in February with five leased aircraft, is not about to challenge the giants of the domestic airline industry. But the six-month-long brouhaha over its certification, tentatively approved last week over the bitter opposition of its direct likely competitors, presages far more important battles over the issue of foreign control of American carriers. 
The time is ripe, argues Dan Kasper, an airline consultant and former Federal regulator, for a dramatic turnaround in airline policy. Rather than protecting domestic carriers from competition, Washington should welcome foreign investment -provided American airlines are offered reciprocal opportunities abroad.
Since the skies were deregulated in 1978, anyone with both the knowledge and the bankroll has been permitted to start an airline. The only catch - the one that almost grounded Discovery - is that foreigners may not own more than 25 percent or exercise substantial control.
The prime movers behind Discovery are the Japanese Nansay Corporation, which wants to funnel Japanese vacationers to its multibillion-dollar Hawaiian resort developments, and the British Aerospace Corporation, which wants to sell its sleek BAe-146 jet in the American market. They stitched together a deal to cover nearly all the airline's start-up costs with foreign cash while leaving American citizens with both 100 percent of the common stock and control of the board.
Aloha and Hawaiian, the established inter-island carriers, went crackers over the threat of a third airline in a market that has not been particularly profitable for two. Discovery, they charged, was a Trojan horse for foreigners: dependence on Japanese money and concessionary British leases would effectively leave foreigners in control.
Undecided on the legal or policy merits of the case, the Transportation Department delayed approval through the fall. But last week - too late for Discovery to catch the cream of the winter bookings - Washington relented. Discovery will be permitted to fly while the lawyers wrangle over the degree of influence exercised by Philip Ho, a Chinese-American who is both an employee of Nansay and the carrier's principal stockholder.
Perhaps all is well that ends well. Hawaii will gain an airline eager to compete on both price and service. But the long delay and muddy conclusion to the Discovery case shows that the Bush Administration has yet to make up its mind about foreign ownership. And that issue is not about to go away.
Airline deregulation can work in the interests of the traveling public, it is widely agreed, only if established carriers are disciplined by the threat of new competitors. But the failure of a half-dozen start-up airlines in the last few years has made it almost impossible to raise the vast sums needed to challenge an American or a United on its home turf. The only players with both the incentive to take the risk and pockets deep enough to mount a credible threat seem to be foreign.
That is why the Bush Administration is walking the narrow line. On the one hand, it is policing the spirit as well as the letter of the prohibition against foreign ownership - forcing Northwest, for example, to rewrite its passive financing arrangement with KLM. On the other hand, it is reluctant to close the door to any deal that would increase competition.
But the luxury of such ambivalence is growing more costly. Braniff, grounded by bankruptcy, is not likely to fly again unless it is sold to a foreign airline that covets domestic American routes. Both T.W.A. and Pan Am, moreover, are losing a small fortune on domestic operations. The best guess is that their only long-term alternatives to liquidation or mergers with other domestic carriers will be sales to foreigners.
To many economists, the solution is simple: repeal the law against foreign ownership. There is no obvious reason, after all, why it is in America's interest to allow Honda to make cars in Ohio - but not allow Japan Airlines to offer service between Cincinnati and Cleveland.
To Mr. Kasper, who negotiated international airline agreements for the Carter Administration, that answer seems politically naive. The domestic market cannot be opened, he argues, unless there is something in it for established domestic carriers. And that something, Mr. Kasper suggests, should be reciprocal investment rights abroad.
Some countries, notably Japan, would initially resist. But how long, one wonders, would they be able to hold out if the European Community cut a deal to allow an American presence in Europe? The time to negotiate such liberalization, Mr. Kasper argues, is sooner rather than later. If Washington waits until another United States carrier goes belly up, the terms of the deal are bound to be less attractive to American interests.

HEADLINE: Tisches Add to Holdings Of Bank of Boston Stock

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
The Bank of Boston Corporation, hard hit by losses on real estate lending, has received a vote of confidence from Laurence A. Tisch, president of CBS Inc., who has bought a large block of the banking company's stock.
Mr. Tisch, widely regarded on Wall Street as a canny investor, has a history of buying into banking companies whose stocks have been battered but are fundamentally sound. In the case of the Bank of Boston, he led a group of family members in acquiring 6.6 percent of the company's shares. 
News of the Tisch family purchases, which were disclosed yesterday in documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, caused the Bank of Boston's stock to rise by $1.375, to $18.125. $94.5 Million Invested Since Oct. 23, when the Bank of Boston's stock closed at $21.75, Mr. Tisch has bought about 4.4 million shares; he already held more than 300,000 shares. So far, Mr. Tisch has invested $94.5 million, resulting in an average price per share of about $20.02, well below the Bank of Boston's high earlier this year of $30.625, but higher than yesterday's close.
''Let's not kid ourselves, they made some loans they regret,'' said Thomas J. Tisch, a son of Laurence Tisch, and managing partner of FLF Associates, one of the buyers of the Bank of Boston stock. ''But they have been forthright in dealing with the problems.''
Mr. Tisch added that despite its $125 million loss in the third quarter, the Bank of Boston remained more strongly capitalized than many other banks its size. The banking company is the 15th largest in the country and the largest in New England.
 
'Over Penalization' Seen
The Tisch investment in the Bank of Boston is a contrarian one. Problems in real estate lending have led to heavy selling of bank stocks, particulary in New England. Mr. Tisch said, however, that the Bank of Boston's stock had been ''over penalized'' and ''over discounted'' for the region's problems.
At the Bank of New England Corporation, the Bank of Boston's regional rival, mounting problems with real estate loans led its directors to demand the resignation of Walter J. Connolly Jr., its chief executive, once a successor is found. The Bank of New England has been even harder hit than the Bank of Boston, having recently rescinded its fourth-quarter dividend, and announced an increase in its reserve for loan losses to more than $1 billion from $354 million. Analysts expect that will result in a loss of $350 million or more for the year.
Mr. Tisch compared the Bank of Boston investment with his family's purchase in 1986 and 1987 of stock in First Interstate Iowa. Share prices for that banking company have since doubled, as the values of farmland and the Iowa economy have recovered.
Marc Perkins, chairman of Perkins, Smith Inc., a Tampa, Fla., securities firm that advises the Tisch family on many bank stock investments, said, ''There are many banks, like Bank of Boston, who are victims of an overheated economy, but were intelligent lenders and will turn out to be excellent investments.''

As Westmark Divests, Its Chairman Resigns

BYLINE: By Lawrence M. Fisher

 BODY:
Adm. Bobby R. Inman has resigned as chairman, president and chief executive of Westmark Systems Inc. and its subsidiary, Tracor Holdings Inc., effective Dec. 31.
Admiral Inman said he decided to resign after determining that another executive would be better suited to a recently announced program to sell various assets of Tracor, a military electronics and instruments company based in Austin, Tex. 
Admiral Inman said he ''made the judgment in early spring, looking at the defense market and at our debt structure, that Tracor would not be stable in the long term.'' At that time, he said, the decision was made to sell the company's aviation systems unit, the instruments group and some or all of the military electronics business. But the sales were delayed for five months, he said.
''I have been very frustrated with this,'' said Admiral Inman, who is 58 years old. ''I feel infinitely better now that this will be put in the hands of an old pro, someone who has been to the table before,'' he said. ''I bring no expertise to bear as we proceed with asset sales and begin to restructure.''
Westmark said a committee of board members was evaluating candidates to succeed Admiral Inman on a permanent basis. In the meantime, Elvis A. Mason, managing partner of the Mason Best Company, will assume the position of chairman and chief executive of Westmark. Mason Best is a Dallas-based merchant banking company that founded Westmark in 1986 and is its largest shareholder.
Dr. William C. Moyer has been named acting president and chief executive of Tracor. Dr. Moyer joined Tracor in 1960 and holds the title of group vice president.
Admiral Inman was recruited by Westmark, which was formed to acquire military and technology companies. Westmark acquired Tracor in September 1987 for $694.4 million.
Admiral Inman is a former deputy director of the Central Intelligence Agency, director of naval intelligence and head of the National Security Agency. In 1983, he founded the Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation in Austin, Tex., a a research consortium of 20 computer and military companies.
Admiral Inman said he had received several offers since letting it be known he was leaving Westmark but that he would wait at least six weeks before deciding what to do. He said he plans to continue team-teaching a graduate course in economics for national security at the University of Texas. He is also a director on several corporate boards and lobbies on behalf of the United States' ability to compete in the international marketplace.
He is married, with two grown sons.

HEADLINE: C.D.'s and Bank Funds Off

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields on certificates of deposit and money market accounts at commercial banks and savings institutions were mostly down for the week that ended yesterday.
''The odds favor a drop in the prime rate,'' said Robert K. Heady, the publisher of The Bank Rate Monitor, ''but by waiting until after the New Year, it may enable some banks to charge-out January loan payments at the previous higher rate instead of the new one.
''Continuing rumors of rising inflation have been discounted by major banks, especially in New York, where yields on have dropped 2 points since April,'' Mr. Heady added. ''If the banks thought that inflation would be a factor, they'd be raising rates, not lowering them.'' 
At the Treasury's regular weekly auction of three- and six-month bills yesterday, interest rates increased sharply. But analysts said the results were distorted by holiday factors. The auction results often influence what many banks and savings institutions pay on money market accounts and C.D.'s.
The average rate for a three-month bill rose by 15 basis points, to 7.77 percent, while the rate for a six-month bill increased by 21 basis points, to 7.64 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
 
General Market Decline
The Bank Rate Monitor's weekly survey of New York area banks showed that C.D. yields at commercial banks and savings institutions were all down by nearly the same.
At commercial banks, the yield on an average money market account declined by 2 basis points, to 6.65 percent, while three-month and six month C.D.'s fell by 3 basis points each, to 7.93 percent and 7.80 percent, respectively.
Money market accounts at savings institutions were also off by 2 basis points, to 6.62 percent, while three-month and six-month certificates fell by 4 basis points each, to 8.16 percent 8.19 percent, respectively.
Among 20 large banks nationwide, the average yield on money market accounts and on six-month C.D.'s dropped by a basis point each, to 6.44 percent and 7.83 percent, respectively.
For the third straight week, the yields offered on certificates and money market accounts held at large credit unions were mixed. Money market accounts rose by 2 basis points, to 6.77 percent, while six-month and one-year C.D.'s were unchanged at 8.01 percent and 8.16 percent, respectively. Depositors seeking to buy longer maturities will find yields on two-and-a-half-year and five-year C.D.'s down by 2 basis points each, to 8.24 percent and 8.23 percent, respectively.

HEADLINE: U.S. Stake Abroad Is Up

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
American companies are increasing their investments overseas, particularly in Europe, where they do not want to miss growth opportunities, economists for the Conference Board say.
''Europe is a dynamic growth area,'' said James Greene, a consultant to the board, citing the European Community's plan to establish a single market by the end of 1992. 
The Conference Board is a New York-based research group that is supported by many corporations.
The Ford Motor Company's acquisition of Jaguar P.L.C. of Britian and the General Motors Corportion's purchase of 50 percent of Saab-Scania A.B. of Sweden are just ''the tip of the iceberg,'' said Stephen J. Cooney of the National Association of Manufacturers, an industry group.
American companies have so far this year worked out plans to establish 220 manufacturing projects overseas, up from 180 projects in 1988, Mr. Greene said. He added that he expected the trend to continue for at least four years.
United States direct investment abroad rose by $25.01 billion in the first nine months of last year, to $351.91 billion, after rising by $18.9 billion in all of 1988, according to Commerce Department estimates.
In the same period, direct investment by foreign companies in the United States grew faster, as it has for most of the decade. Foreign investment rose by $22.65 billion, to $350.15 billion, after surging $58.44 billion last year.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Banks That Shine Amid the Gloom

BYLINE: By Michael Quint

 BODY:
THE last few months have been terrible times for bank stocks, as losses from real estate lending at some New England banks have raised fears of similar problems in other regions.
After record earnings in 1988 and the first half of 1989, banks are now suffering from a rise in delinquent real estate loans, particularly loans to developers for building new houses, condominiums, office buildings and shopping centers. Loans past due by 90 days or more have tripled at many banks since the end of 1988. As prices fall for the real estate used to secure the loans, banks are increasing the reserves they set aside to cover losses on the loans. 
When these reserves increase, profits decline, a process that is well under way in New England and is becoming more apparent in other states, including New Jersey and Arizona. Although loan-loss reserves have not been increasing sharply in Florida or California, investors have been wary about bank stocks in those states.
''Real estate lending is not the only villain,'' said James J. McDermott, senior vice president of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc., a securities firm that specializes in banking companies. ''Banks are also hurt by expectations of a weakening economy and problems with loans for leveraged buyouts.''
As the outlook became more negative, Mr. McDermott said, many investors decided to get out of banking stocks - including those with solid earnings, like the BankAmerica Corporation, the First Chicago Corporation and Wells Fargo & Company. Although Wells Fargo has been an active lender for both real estate and leveraged buyouts, its management continues to assure analysts that problems are not building.
The possibility that large retailing companies might declare bankruptcy has raised another cloud over banks.
Given the present and potential loan problems of banks, it is not surprising that since early October, prices of many bank stocks have fallen by 25 percent and more, while the overall market has fallen only slightly. According to an index compiled by Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, bank stock prices have risen only 15.2 percent since the end of 1988, compared with a 25.1 percent gain for the Standard & Poor's 500. From the end of 1988 to Oct. 6, however, bank issues were much stronger than the overall market, rising 37 percent, compared with a 29 percent gain for the S.&P. 500.
Although it is clear that the banking industry has lost the luster it had earlier in the year, securities analysts have identified many banks that they expect to escape the worst of the problems, either because of a strong regional economy or astute lending policies.
Within New England for example, the State Street Boston Corporation, which did not participate heavily in New England's real estate boom of the 1980's, is not vulnerable to losses as the bubble bursts. State Street has focused on processing transactions for other banks and mutual funds.
The Fleet/Norstar Financial Group of Providence, R.I., is another New England company recommended by some analsyts. Besides the benefit of its operations in upstate New York, where there have not been severe real estate problems, Fleet/Norstar cut back on real estate lending far sooner than its neighbors at the Bank of Boston Corporation or the Bank of New England Corporation.
And not everyone is avoiding those institutions. Laurence A. Tisch, the president of CBS Inc. who has a reputation as a canny investor, has bought 4.72 million shares in the Bank of Boston, or 6.6 percent of the outstanding shares. Since Oct. 23, when the bank's stock closed at $21.75, Mr. Tisch has bought about 4.4 million shares. So far, Mr. Tisch has invested $94.5 million, resulting in an average price per share of about $20.02, well below the Bank of Boston's high this year of $30.625, but above yesterday's close of $18.125, up $1.375, on the New York Stock Exchange.
Among banking companies outside New England, Virginia Adair, an analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., recommends the Corestates Financial Corporation of Philadelphia; the Sovran Financial Corporation of Norfolk, Va.; the First Wachovia Corporation of Winston-Salem, N.C., and the Norwest Corporation of Minneapolis. All have a history of avoiding bad loans and speculative real estate ventures.
New York City banks, whose nationwide lending exposes them to bad markets as well as good, have been reporting higher levels of delinquent loans. An exception is the Republic New York Corporation, which has no loans for leveraged buyouts and practically no exposure to commercial real estate. Republic is known for its reluctance to lend to any but the safest borrowers; its stock closed yesterday at $50.875, up 12.5 cents and near its high for the year of $51.625.
Analysts at Oppenheimer & Company are recommending banks in the economically stable Midwest. Among their picks are the NBD Bancorp of Detroit, which has only 8 percent of its loans to companies in the sluggish automobile industry; Comerica Inc., another Detroit banking company, and the National City Corporation of Cleveland.

HEADLINE: Stocks Are Mixed in Very Slow Trading

BYLINE: By PHILLIP H. WIGGINS

 BODY:
Stock prices ended narrowly mixed yesterday in extremely slow post-Christmas trading. The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 2.13 points, to 2,709.26, but advances on the New York Stock Exchange edged out declines by 712 to 664.
Two hours into trading only about 28 million shares had changed hands, one of the slowest starts in recent months. By the close, volume on the Big Board was only 77.6 million shares, well below the 121 million traded last Friday, a relatively slow day itself. Yesterday's volume was the lowest since 68.87 million shares were traded on July 3, the Monday before Independence Day. 
Equities appeared to be unaffected by an early and sustained tumble in bond prices. The decline was considered distorted by some credit market participants, who cited thin trading. One reason for the slowness in both stocks and bonds was that many overseas traders were still observing the Christmas holiday. 30-Year Treasury Issue By late in the day the bellwether 30-year Treasury issue was down 1 10/ 32, to 101 19/32, to yield 7.98 percent, up from last Friday's close of 7.87 percent.
''The market appears to be almost asleep,'' one trader said late yesterday, while noting that stocks traded thinly and in a narrow range throughout most of the session.
''Investors apparently were still on holiday as the market shrugged off the rise in interest rates in Japan, the steep slump in U.S. bond prices brought about by renewed inflationary fears over oil prices, a weaker dollar and what appears to have been a pretty decent Christmas season,'' said Larry Kekst, senior portfolio manager at the National City Corporation in Cleveland.
Movement in the broader market measures was almost as minuscule as that of the Dow. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slipped 0.61, to 346.81, while the New York Stock Exchange composite index lost a mere 0.23, to 191.72. Traders said that an expected spate of ''bottom fishing'' -when investors attempt to pick up year-end bargains - failed to develop.
 
Weakness In the Dollar
Slight weakness in the dollar against both the Japanese yen and the West German mark was one thing holding back the stock market, analysts said. They also noted that oil stocks were mixed in the wake of the extensive fire that ravaged petroleum storage facilities in Louisiana. Production operations, however, were largely unscathed, industry experts pointed out.
Phillips Petroleum rose 1/2, to 25 7/8, even though the company said it would reduce gasoline production at its Sweeny, Tex., refinery about 10 percent for 10 to 12 days because of a small fire in a processing unit.
Exxon was off 1/2, to 50 1/8. A blast over the weekend shut down the company's 455,000-barrel-a-day refinery in Baton Rouge, La. An Exxon spokesman said that although some internal pipelines were damaged, the plant's production facilities were not affected.
Elsewhere in the group, Chevron dipped 5/8, to 67 1/8, and Mobil was unchanged at 62 3/8.
Among other individual issues, Avon Products added 1/2, to 36 3/4. Chartwell Associates L.P. said it had bought 401,000 additional shares of the cosmetics company's stock, bringing its total holdings in the company to 8.7 percent.
L.A. Gear jumped 2 points, to 33 1/4, in heavy trading, partly because of a report in Barron's magazine that said the athletic footwear maker might rally in early January after late December selling pressure eases.
Bank of New England was the most active stock, as well as the biggest percentage gainer, rising 1/4, to 7 3/8, on a volume of 2.2 million shares. The company said it was developing a program to deal with the depressed real estate market in New England and that it continued to explore alternatives, like potential mergers and sales of assets. The bank also said its chairman and chief executive, Walter J. Connolly Jr. would step down as chief executive as soon as a replacement is named.
The Bank of Boston Corporation gained 1 3/8, to 18 1/8. Traders said Laurence A. Tisch, the investor, and the rest of the group that had bought a 6.6 percent interest in the company believed the stock was oversold and that the bank would weather its real estate problems.
UAL jumped 7 1/4, to 170 1/4. Traders said there appeared to be concentrating purchases by a single buyer operating through Bear, Stearns & Company, although that buyer could not be immediately identified. Later a second investor was said to be buying heavily.
On the American Stock Exchange, the market value index dipped 0.04, to 370.80, while in over-the-counter trading, the Nasdaq composite index edged up 0.69, to 445.26.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Prices Off Sharply in Thin Trading

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities plunged yesterday in thin trading.
Dealers said that many market participants in the United States and overseas remained on holiday and that many dealers and portfolio managers had either closed their books for 1989 or were reluctant to take on any significant new positions.
''We have few players, no sizable trades, and those seeking to sell Treasury notes and bonds found prices falling through air pockets,'' one dealer said. ''Given the thinness of the market, prices could just as easily reverse course and go through the roof tomorrow.'' 
 
'A New Willingness'
But Jonathan B. Greenspan, chief trader at Aegis Capital Management, said: ''Of course the market was thin and the price gaps between bids and offers very wide. Still, we have been detecting a new willingness by the market to finally respond to negative news, such as the recent surge in oil prices, however temporary it may be.''
Price weakness was also evident in the results of the Treasury's regular weekly bill auction, which Christmas delayed a day.
The average discount rate on the 90-day bills was 7.77 percent, up from 7.62 percent a week ago, and the highest since Oct. 30, when the rate was 7.78 percent. The average discount rate on the six-month bills was 7.64 percent, up from 7.43 percent the week before, and the highest since Oct. 2, when it was 7.92 percent. The outstanding one-year bills climbed 11 basis points, to 7.30 percent. A basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point.
Dealers said the bill auction results were not affected by the Federal Reserve's move to add reserves to the banking system through two-day repurchase agreements.
 
Seasonal Factors
The move was attributed to seasonal factors. After the auctions, the Treasury announced that it will sell an additional $15.5 billion of three- and six-month bills on Tuesday because Monday is New Year's Day.
In late and even thinner dealings, the Treasury's benchmark long bonds, the 8 1/8 percent issue maturing in 2019, was being offered at 101 19/ 32, down 1 10/32, or $13.13 for each $1,000 of face value. The long bond's yield climbed to 7.98 percent, from 7.87 percent at Friday's close.
Among other representative Treasury issues traded in the secondary market, the 7 5/8 percent notes of 1991 fell 9/32, to 99 17/32, for a yield of 7.88 percent; the 7 5/8's of 1993 dropped 15/ 32, to 99 5/32, and a yield of 7.87 percent, and the long notes, the 7 7/8's of 1999, lost 27/32, at 99 20/32, and now yield 7.93 percent, compared with 7.80 percent at Friday's close.
Leif H. Olson, who heads a money management and consulting firm bearing his name in New Canaan, Conn., said: ''The sharp drop in prices of Treasury paper is being attributed in some quarters to the rise in fuel prices, by others to the weakness of the dollar. But the fact is we had a very thin market today, which always lends itself to exaggerated price moves.''
 
'Winter Will End'
Asked about fears that the uncommonly cold early winter weather was causing oil prices and inflation to rise, Mr. Olson replied: ''While fuel oil is not as elastic a commodity as orange juice, winter will end and many people will have to switch to other juices. We don't believe the Federal Reserve is overly concerned about transitory rises in the Consumer Price Index or any other yardstick of inflation.''
What does concern Mr. Olson, who was formerly with the Federal Reserve, is that rising energy and food costs, however temporary, will force many consumers to spend less on other goods, thus further weakening the economy. In any event, the inflation fears and weakness of the dollar did not impress the gold market, where prices fell by more than $5 an ounce.
Given the rise in key Japanese interest rates over the weekend and the recent decline in the dollar against major foreign currencies, Mr. Olson noted: ''While a weakening dollar is bothersome, we should not fear any massive unloading of dollars by the Japanese or anyone else. When Japanese financial institutions sell dollars for yen, the buyers are usually other Japanese houses exchanging yen for dollars.''
Following are the results of the Treasury's regular auctions of three- and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: Japan Urged to Lift Living Standards

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Dec. 26

 BODY:
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development today praised Japan's strong economic growth, but called on Tokyo to increase its people's living standards to help the Japanese consume more and reduce that nation's huge trade surplus.
Noting that the living standards of the Japanese are low in light of the nation's industrial might and financial assets, the O.E.C.D. urged the Japanese Government to take several steps to raise living standards: reduce working hours, make more land and housing available and increase competition in the distribution sector to help make consumer goods more affordable.
In its annual report on Japan, the organization stated that even though Japan ranks fifth among industrial nations in per capita income, its people rank 10th in purchasing power, partly because of the inflated price of goods in Japan.
 
'Substantial Discrepancy'
''There is still a substantial discrepancy between the country's economic strength and the relatively poor quality of life,'' said the O.E.C.D., a Paris-based organization of 24 industrial nations that promotes economic cooperation. 
The O.E.C.D. criticized the clubby, closed nature of Japan's distribution system, saying it has artificially inflated prices, created obstacles to imports and helped keep Japan's trade surplus high.
The organization projects that Japan's current-account surplus will climb from $60.1 billion this year to $61.1 billion next year and to $68.6 billion in 1991.
''It is a political fact that the persistence of a surplus of the size of Japan's causes considerable friction between major trading nations and risks provoking protectionist measures in some countries,'' the report stated.
 
Domestic Demand
The organization praised Japan for stimulating domestic demand in recent years to keep growth strong as the yen soared in value. The yen's rise was expected to slow growth in Japan inasmuch as the rise was intended in part to slow Japan's export momentum by making its goods more expensive abroad.
The O.E.C.D. foresees robust growth of 4.5 percent in 1990 for Japan and 4.3 percent in 1991. That compares with the 2.3 percent growth the organization projects for the United States next year.
The report noted that Japanese workers work more hours each year than the workers of any other industrialized nation. According to the organization, Japanese workers put in 2,064 hours of work on average in 1975, but that climbed to a total annual average of 2,111 in 1988.
In Japan, the share of workers with two days off each week was only 30 percent last year. Although Japanese workers are entitled to 15 paid days off each year, they take only 7.5 days off on average. That compares with an average of 20 paid days taken off in the United States and 30 days in Europe.
Shortening work hours, the report said, may improve the welfare of the Japanese people, as well as ''make a useful contribution'' to reducing the trade surplus.
 
Obstacles to Imports
Regarding the distribution system, the organization said there are numerous obstacles to the entry of imports that inflate prices and discourage imported goods. It mentioned the distributors' preference for long-term trading relationships with suppliers, close links between producers and distributors and the atomistic structure of the retail sector. The United States Government has repeatedly pressed Japan to open up its distribution sector to make it easier for American companies to sell goods in Japan. In theory, that would help reduce the American trade deficit and Japanese trade surplus.
The O.E.C.D. strongly criticized the idea of fixing official targets for Japan's trade surplus or assigning shares for foreign suppliers in specific Japanese markets. Those ideas have been suggested by some American legislators. The O.E.C.D. said such policies would undermine free trade and lead to an inefficient allocation of resources.
The report noted that Japan had used its current-account surplus to invest elsewhere, most notably in the United States, which has contributed to the American trade deficit. It said that as these ''outflows increasingly take the form of direct investment'' in property and businesses, there ''are signs they may create frictions of their own.''
 
International Pattern
The organization said the Japanese trade surplus should be viewed as part of an international pattern of imbalances that if continued for a prolonged period might lead to a cumulative position that could disrupt world financial markets.
''For all these reasons,'' the report concluded, ''it is important for Japan's surplus in relation to gross national product to continue on a downward trend.''

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
The Dollar Falls Broadly While Gold Also Retreats

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar declined yesterday against most key foreign currencies in extremely thin post-holiday trading. Gold prices fell after rising in Asia. 
The financial markets were closed on Monday in the United States and in Europe in observance of Christmas.
Trading remained slow yesterday as many American traders decided to extend their holiday and most European markets remained closed for Boxing Day.
Traders said the market had little reaction to the Bank of Japan's decision on Monday to raise its discount rate - the interest charged for loans to commercial banks - to 4.25 percent from 3.75 percent. The move, which raises the value of the yen against the dollar, had been widely anticipated by the market, they said.
Nonetheless, the overall sentiment toward the dollar remains bearish as prospects for lower United States interest rates rise with more evidence of economic weakness, said Earl I. Johnson, a trader with the Harris Trust and Company in Chicago.
In New York, the dollar traded at 141.845 yen, lower than 142.35 yen on Friday. The dollar lost value against the pound, which cost $1.6265, higher than $1.62425 Friday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late quotes Friday, included: 1.6987 West German marks, down from 1.7070; 1.54825 Swiss francs, down from 1.5490; 1.16005 Canadian dollars, up from 1.15925; 5.8020 French francs, down from 5.8345, and 1,272.75 Italian lire, down from 1,277.75.
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery fell $6.40, to $406.80 an ounce. The Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late bid for gold at $407 an ounce, off $6.75 from Friday.
Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 40 cents to close at $413.85 an ounce.
Silver bullion settled at $5.512 an ounce on New York's Comex, down 4.8 cents from late Friday.

HEADLINE: AFTER NORIEGA: U.S. AND ROME;
Vatican Balks at Handing Over Noriega

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 27

 BODY:
The Vatican appeared today to reject President Bush's argument that Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega was a common criminal who should be handed over to the United States for trial.
The chief Vatican spokesman, Joaquin Navarro-Valls, told reporters in Rome that the Holy See was not inclined to turn over General Noriega, who took refuge in the Papal Nuncio's offices in Panama City on Sunday, because the church believed that his asylum request had certain legitimate political dimensions.
The United States, which attacked Panama on Dec. 20 with the capture of General Noriega as one of its primary goals, views him as a ''narco-terrorist'' avoiding prosecution.
 
Bush Shuns Clash With Vatican
Like most countries, the Vatican does not grant asylum or temporary refuge to criminals, but will do so for individuals fleeing political or religious persecution. 
President Bush, speaking to reporters in Corpus Christi, Tex., at the start of a six-day hunting and fishing vacation, said he still wanted General Noriega brought to the United States for trial on drug charges, and that he has ''made clear our preference'' to the Vatican. When apprised by reporters that the Vatican spokesman seemed to be publicly rejecting these arguments, Mr. Bush said: ''That complicates things if they said that.''
But the President avoided being drawn into any public criticism of the Vatican's position.
''How would you like it if people were negotiating and talking, and then somebody jumped up and said they were wrongheaded, especially at this time of the year?'' Mr. Bush asked. ''Especially since this is the Vatican?''
 
No Time Limit on Noriega Case
Mr. Bush added that he has put ''no time limit'' on how long he will continue to seek General Noriega, ''just like we didn't have a time set on when Noriega would no longer be in the field fighting.''
Tonight, speaking to a group of Bee County Republicans, the President stressed that he wanted to ''work with our friends in the Vatican and work with the new Endara Government'' to bring General Noriega to trial in the United States.
''I want to see this man, under indictment in this country, come to justice for poisoning children and people around the world,'' he said.
 
Release of Noriega Unlikely
The manner with which Mr. Bush was treating the Vatican's statement seemed be the first public indication of what many Administration officials had been saying privately: that whatever their legal case against General Noriega, it is most unlikely that the Vatican, with its long history of granting political and religious asylum, is going to depart from that tradition and put him out on the street.
Indeed, it is with the assumption that General Noriega is most likely to be dispatched to a third country that the Justice Department today filed legal papers with the governments of France, Switzerland, Luxembourg and Britain, asking them to freeze bank accounts where the Panamanian ruler is believed to have hidden millions of dollars in illegal drug profits.
Administration officials said they want to do all they can to freeze and seize General Noriega's foreign bank accounts to deprive him as much as possible of any economic resources with which he might foment trouble in Panama from exile.
 
'More Than a Criminal Case'
Speaking to reporters in Rome, Mr. Navarro-Valls was quoted by Reuters as saying, ''Based on my knowledge of international law and diplomatic procedures I cannot see any possible way that a nunciature accredited to a certain country, in this case Panama, can hand over to another state somebody who is in it.''
Asked to explain the differences between the White House and the Vatican over General Noriega's status, Mr. Navarro-Valls said: ''I don't want to get into the complex problems of General Noriega, but he had been for a time head of a government, had been for a time head of the armed forces. So there is something more than a criminal case involved here.''
Putting General Noriega out into the streets, where he would immediately be seized by United States and Panamanian troops, would be ''absolutely outside usual norms of diplomatic procedure and international law,'' Mr. Navarro-Valls said. ''I don't see how it could be done.''
 
Support for Papal Nuncio
Mr. Navarro-Valls said Vatican and American diplomats have been holding ''frequent, clear and cordial'' meetings in Rome. He said that the Papal Nuncio in Panama City, Msgr. Jose Sebastian Laboa, accepted General Noriega without prior consultation with Rome, but defended the move anyway. ''I have to underline,'' Mr. Navarro-Valls said, ''that the attitude of the Apostolic Nunciature in Panama helped in a very positive way to put an end to the conflict and to hasten the time of peace in a country with a high number of victims and suffering.''
General Noriega, he added, was accepted after he made ''a very serious commitment to help end the bloodshed. The developments of the facts show that he has succeeded.'' He did not elaborate on General Noriega's commitment.
Mr. Navarro said Pope John Paul II had been kept informed about the case but was not involved in the negotiations. He said that the Vatican actually considered its main negotiating partner in the case to be the new Panamanian Government of President Guillermo Endara, which had not yet made any request for General Noriega.
Tonight, Panamanian officials in Washington said that Mr. Endara sent a letter to the Pope today asking him to turn General Noriega over to American authorities. The Panamanians said that they had not yet received a response from the Vatican.
 
U.S. Pursuing Its Goal
Despite these arguments, President Bush insisted that the Administration was still doing all that it could to convince the Vatican to hand over the deposed Panamanian general. Asked if in fact he wouldn't prefer that General Noriega be shipped to a third country instead of facing a trial where he might disclose any Central Intelligence Agency information from the days when he was on the C.I.A. payroll, Mr. Bush answered flatly, ''No.''
''I think that's history, and I think that the main thing is that he should be tried and brought to justice,'' Mr. Bush told reporters upon his arrival at Corpus Christi Naval Air Station. ''We are pursuing that course with no fear of that. You may get into some release of certain confidential documents that he may try to blindside the whole justice process. But the system works, so wouldn't worry about that.''
 
No Calls to the Pope
Mr. Bush, who likes to pick up the telephone and call leaders directly in times of crisis, said today that he had not called the Pope or Monsignor Laboa in in Panama.
In Paris, Reuters quoted judicial contacts as saying that the authorities have frozen between $3.4 million and $4.3 million held in French bank accounts controlled by General Noriega. They said at least five accounts, in the names of Noriega and members of his family, had been frozen since Friday.
In Switzerland, the Justice Ministry issued a statement saying it had ordered a precautionary freeze of two accounts in Swiss banks in Zurich and Geneva after a request from the United States to freeze General Noriega's assets.

HEADLINE: AFTER NORIEGA: LATIN SHOCK WAVES;
MANAGUA ECONOMY HINGES ON PANAMA

BYLINE: By MARK A. UHLIG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANAGUA, Nicaragua, Dec. 27

 BODY:
By deposing Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, the United States may end up gaining important new economic leverage over Nicaragua and Cuba, diplomats and business officials say.
For both countries, the officials say, the Noriega Government in Panama served as a major intermediary for evading American trade restrictions and providing access to a broad range of American-made goods, from machine parts to toothpicks. The fall of his Government could thus force costly changes across the spectrum of Nicaraguan and Cuban commerce, threatening new instability in both hard-hit economies.
The new Panamanian Government has made no formal decision about its future ties with either country, or, in particular, whether it will support American trade sanctions against them. But the mere prospect of new American control over the Panamanian economy has already sent shock waves through the region. And the threat of a change in Panama's economic relations has had special impact in Nicaragua, where even short-term economic setbacks could have important implications for the outcome of national elections scheduled for Feb. 25. 
 
Panama, the Clearing House
''As far as Nicaragua is concerned, there has already been a de facto break in relations,'' noted Juan Jose Medina, who edits an economic newsletter in Managua. ''At this point, we can't even get our people out of the country.''
Since an American trade embargo was imposed against the Nicaraguan Government in 1985, Panama has emerged as a central clearing house for Nicaragua's foreign commerce. Nicaraguan experts say the Government maintains an estimated 80 local front companies there dedicated to evading American trade restrictions.
To avoid American financial sanctions, Nicaragua has also used Panama as a base for its official banking, maintaining its principal Government funds there in private, dollar-denominated accounts.
At a retail level, the most visible of Nicaragua's connections to Panama is its growing system of so-called diplotiendas, or stores that permit customers to spend in dollars to buy high-quality American and European merchandise that is otherwise unavailable here.
 
Vital Source of Currency
First established as a special service to the foreign diplomatic corps in Managua, the Government-owned chain of stores has expanded dramatically in recent years, fueled by large quantities of dollars that are sent back to relatives from Nicaraguans who have emigrated to the United States.
With large American-style supermarkets and associated services that range from gourmet food shops to one-hour film processing, the diplotienda system is estimated to generate more than $100 million a year in sales. That sum breaks down to about $30 for every Nicaraguan citizen - roughly one full month's pay for the average Nicaraguan worker.
The system has been a vital source of hard currency for the Sandinista Government, and has provided an important, controlled means of satisfying consumer demand for high-quality goods that cannot be produced locally.
Government economists estimate that as much as 80 percent of the diplotienda system's inventory is purchased directly from Panama, and the country has no ready means of replacing that supply.
Pro-Government economists argue that Nicaragua, if it is willing to pay higher costs, could develop new supply routes through Guatemala, Mexico or South America within a matter of months. But they acknowledge that the delays involved would exhaust current inventories, which are believed to be sufficient only through late January.
They say that a resulting shortfall could pose a serious political problem for the Government in the February elections, which are expected to hinge largely on economic issues.
Foreign experts point out that any restrictions on Nicaraguan trade with Panama could have serious repercussions for any government ministries and quasi-official enterprises, many of which have developed their own wholly owned Panamanian subsidiaries to procure badly needed American goods and technology.
A strict enforcement of trade sanctions against Nicaragua could also prevent Copa, the Panamanian passenger airline, from stopping in Managua on its daily shuttle among Central American capitals, depriving Nicaraguans of their most important remaining means of regional air transportation. ---- Sandinista Warning MANAGUA, Nicaragua, Dec. 27 - In an unusually harsh radio message, the Ministry of Defense warned today that, if the United States were to invade Nicaraguan territory, Sandinista security forces would execute all Nicaraguan ''traitors'' who encouraged the American action.
''At the beginning of the Yankee intervention,'' the Defense Ministry declared, military and police units would ''carry out plans for the neutralization, trial and execution of all the most recalcitrant, traitorous elements that openly or covertly have incited the Yankee intervention.''
The message, read as a special announcement over national radio, was repeated twice without pause for emphasis. It appeared to underscore the Government's mounting alarm and frustration over the American invasion of Panama, and it provoked new concern about Nicaragua's political campaign process, which is to culminate in elections on Feb. 25.

HEADLINE: AFTER NORIEGA: REBUILDING;
Efforts Abroad to Help the Economy

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 27

 BODY:
Panama faces the daunting task of rebuilding an economy ravaged not only by bullets and bombs but also by two years of economic war with the United States.
The Bush Administration has dismantled economic sanctions and is preparing both emergency aid and longer-range economic support that could involve donors like Japan and lending organizations like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
Japan's interest in Panama stems from its interest in the canal, an artery for its cars, videocassette recorders, headphones and other exports to the Eastern United States and Western Europe.
After a series of inter-agency meetings on Panama this week involving members of the Treasury and State Departments, an American team is expected to fly to Panama ''in coming days'' to evaluate specific needs, a State Department official said. 
 
No Prediction on Cost
No officials will predict how much the aid might cost American taxpayers. ''It would be analytically misleading to come up with any number,'' one official said. ''It depends on what other donors do and on the public policy decisions of the Bush Administration.''
Asked for a broad estimate, he said $50 million would be too low and $1.5 billion too high.
To work with the American authorities in coordinating the aid, Panama's newly installed President, Guillermo Endara, has dispatched a Panamanian economist, Guillermo Chapman, to Washington.
Mr. Chapman, who is serving as ambassador-at-large, has already participated in some of the inter-agency meetings of what is known as the Panama Economic Reconstruction Committee.
 
Unemployment a Key Problem
William D. Rodgers, a Washington lawyer working with Mr. Chapman, identified unemployment, which is running at more than 20 percent of the labor force, as one priority problem for Mr. Endara.
Another high priority is finding accommodations for 16,000 to 25,000 people made homeless during the military operations.
Mr. Rodgers, a former Under Secretary of State for economic affairs, put at $1 billion the direct losses in housing, business inventories and capital goods resulting from the American invasion and subsequent looting.
But he said the Panamanian authorities had decided against extensive Government intervention through public works programs. Instead, the intention is to anchor reconstruction efforts in a revived private sector.
 
Role for U.S. Companies
American companies, which still have a major stake in Panama's economy, are expected to play a vital role in recharging it.
''We're starting to talk to companies about going back and restoring things to normal,'' a Commerce Department official reported.
Keith L. Miceli, executive vice president of the American Chambers of Commerce in Latin America, said he expected the American chamber in Panama to be a catalyst.
''We will be instrumental in urging members to retool and reinvest to get the economic recovery going,'' he said.
About 125 American companies operate in Panama, including the International Business Machines Corporation, the Xerox Corporation, the Eastman Kodak Company, Citicorp and the United Brands Company. United Brands exports bananas and is the country's biggest private employer, with about 14,000 workers.
 
Growth After Cuts Is Seen
Many of the companies, with the exception of United Brands, have reduced their operations. Citicorp, for example, closed two of its 11 branches, cutting staff by about 25 percent, to about 200 workers.
''Following recent events, we expect the local economy will stabilize and begin to grow,'' said Cynthia Stone, a Citicorp official in New York. ''We have a long-term commitment to Panama and will make every effort to meet our local customers' needs as business activity in the country picks up.''
Panama, which until the mid-1980's had a per-capita income more than twice the average in neighboring Central American countries, used to be a leading Western Hemisphere banking center, with deposits in the early 1980's reported around $50 billion.
Today, after blows to business and banking confidence by Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega and the economic sanctions imposed in 1987 and 1988, deposits have shrunk considerably and have mostly been frozen.
 
Banks Set to Reopen
Panama's banks, which have been closed since the start of last week, are expected to reopen Thursday for limited business.
But bank officials here said a return to normalcy would require major infusions of cash and credit in Panama's banking system.
As one specialist at the Inter-American Development Bank put it: ''It is essential to build up credit both for consumption and production in agriculture and industry. The credit has to come from external sources because there is no money in the economy.''
Despite the economic dislocation, Panama's efforts at rebuilding are still likely to be easier than those of most countries of Eastern Europe.
With just 2.3 million inhabitants, Panama is smaller and more manageable than a country like Poland, with 37 million people.
In the reconstruction efforts of Eastern Europe, currencies like the zloty of Poland must still be made convertible into Western money to ease trade and other transactions with Western countries. Panama, on the other hand, has used the American dollar as its local currency for years.
 
A Sense of Responsibility
While there is strong support in Congress and the Bush Administration for helping Eastern Europe, the fact that the United States itself must share some of the responsibility for Panama's troubles has made Washington even more willing to help that country.
''It's only common sense and justice that our first obligation be to Panama,'' said Robert A. Friedlander, Republican chief counsel on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. ''We have a responsibility to clear up that difficulty first.''
To try to restart Panama's economy, the Treasury has begun to release some of the $375 million in Panamanian assets that the United States froze under sanctions by the Reagan Administration against the Noriega regime in April 1988.
In 1987 Congress voted to cut off virtually all economic and military aid to Panama.

HEADLINE: U.S. Plans to Stop Paying Fines for Nuclear Arms Plant Operators

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 27

 BODY:
Within a few months the Energy Department plans to end its decades-old practice of paying all bills, including environmental fines and other penalties, incurred by the companies that run the nation's 17 nuclear weapons plants, department officials say.
Under the plan, the Government would continue paying normal operating expenses, as well as the base fees and bonuses that constitute these contractors' profits. But for the first time since nuclear arms production began in the 1940's, most costs resulting from negligence by the contractors would be borne by them instead of taxpayers. 
The new policy would apply to any future acts of negligence by the contractors, not to any costs they may have incurred for negligence in the past. It would be instituted as part of the regular periodic negotiations in which the Energy Department and the contractors set the level of performance bonuses.
The change in policy comes at a time when the department has been under attack in Congress for accepting liability for criminal penalties, fraudulent losses and other questionable costs of the contractors.
 
Vital Issue of Liability
The issue of liability is important because the plants have severe environmental problems, and some continue to violate environmental laws.
Stephen A. Wakefield, the general counsel of the Energy Department, said in an interview last Friday that the decision to end blanket indemnification for the plant operators would be formally announced next month and that it could become effective by late spring.
In exchange for assuming a bigger share of the financial risk of operating the weapons plants, the contractors will be offered bigger bonus payments for excellent work, Mr. Wakefield said.
He declined to say how much extra bonus money would be made available, but he said ''it would not be unreasonable'' to think current fees might be doubled.
A 15 percent increase will be applied to the bonus payments across the board to adjust for inflation, Mr. Wakefield said, and increases beyond that will reflect the department's desire to provide more incentive for excellent performance.
 
Fees for Operating Plants
Typically the companies can earn several million dollars a year for operating the plants. For example, Westinghouse Electric Corporation, which holds contracts to run several of the plants, earned $3.9 million in bonus fees from April through September for operating the Savannah River nuclear plant near Aiken, S.C.
While stressing that some details of the planned changes had not been worked out, Mr. Wakefield said there are already varying levels of concern among the contractors.
''A couple of them have said, 'Well, this is one more thing we have to consider in - deciding do we want to be in this business,' '' he said, adding that so far, none has indicated it will withdraw as a result of the changes.
He cited several examples of circumstances under which the department would no longer reimburse the contractors. Among them were environmental fines, and related legal costs, stemming from actions by the contractor that could reasonably have been avoided; damage to Government property as a result of negligence, and damage to third parties, including people and property outside the plant, as a result of negligence by the contractor.

HEADLINE: Washington Talk;
Some Need Crystal Ball To Peer Into the Present

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 27

 BODY:
In economics, as in other spheres, it is the simplest questions that are often the hardest to answer.
Take, for example, the No. 1 economic question of the day: Is there going to be a recession?
The simple answer, of course, is yes. Inevitably. Sooner or later the expansion that has just entered its eighth year will simply come to an end. 
In all likelihood, this will more or less coincide with a Commerce Department report that the real gross national product, the nation's total output of goods and services adjusted for inflation, has contracted for the second quarter in a row.
But the formal designation of a recession is another matter. This will take place when the National Bureau of Economic Research, a private organization that is the semiofficial arbiter of recessions, decides that the nation was in a recession. And it is very possible this will not happen until after the worst effects are over.
It was not until July 1988, for instance, that the Commerce Department concluded that the spring quarter of 1986 was really down instead of up. The summer of 1986 was also weaker than had been thought at the time, but the revised figure remained positive and recession was avoided. But that is the simple answer. What people really want to know when they ask about recession is whether there will be one soon, say in 1990.
This is the hard question, the kind that prompts economists to offer an assortment of self-deprecating one-liners like, ''Give them a number or a date but never both,'' and ''If you must forecast, forecast often - and not about the future.''
Even predicting the present or the immediate past poses not inconsiderable risks, what with all the big revisions the Government has been making in many of its figures (in August, for example, one learned that retail sales for May were up substantially instead of slightly down).
Yesterday, the long-bubbling issue of apparent decline in the quality of the official data was raised again, this time by Representative Lee H. Hamilton, an Indiana Democrat who heads the Joint Economic Committee. Citing budget cuts for the slippage, Mr. Hamilton declared, ''The deterioration of Government statistics is a matter of increasing concern among members of the academic and professional communities.''
But frustrating as this may be, statistical inadequacy is not the main reason it is so hard to predict even the near-term economic future with accuracy. The honest answer is that like the stock market, the economy cannot be completely fathomed even by the brightest people using the most advanced computer models. Alan Greenspan, an esteemed economist who now heads the Federal Reserve, cannot always do it. Nor can your stockbroker or bartender, though they may not yet realize or admit their limitations.
The ever-changing relationships of myriad factors in the economy are too complex, and too much depends on a mercurial psychology and on uncontrollables like foreign actions or natural disasters like drought.
In recent months there has been overwhelming evidence of virtual stagnation in manufacturing. So last Friday the Government reported the year's biggest jump in orders for durable goods. Housing has been so weak that party conversation in the Northeast is no longer about real estate coups but rather horror stories of price declines and unsold property. So today the National Association of Realtors reported the year's biggest jump in sales of existing homes.
Predicted disasters, economists note, have a way of never occurring. On the other hand, recessions - once a euphemism for depression but now frightening enough in their own right - tend to come on when they are least expected, and very rapidly.
Still, economists will continue to make predictions, hedging as best they can. Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., for example, says, ''There are several alternative outcomes which are possible for the U.S. economy in 1990.'' It then lists various possibilities, ranging from actual recession, to a slowdown that falls short of recession, to an inflationary boom.
And so on Friday, when the Government publishes the latest reading of the Composite Index of Leading Indicators, its main predictive index for the economy, one mustn't take it too seriously. It does predict most recessions. But it also predicts many that never occur.

HEADLINE: Florida Growers Rush To Save Frozen Crops

BYLINE: By JEFFREY SCHMALZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIAMI, Dec. 27

 BODY:
When the temperature plummeted into the low 20's over the weekend, making much of Florida colder than Anchorage, Ben Abbitt prayed for warmer weather to save the 7,000 acres of oranges owned by him and 250 other members of the Haines City Citrus Growers' Assocation.
But the sun came too late. For two days in a row, the oranges were frozen solid. And now Mr. Abbitt and hundreds of other Florida citrus growers, who produce 70 percent of the orange juice consumed in the United States, are reversing their prayers, asking for cool weather, not warm. 
With the fruit already damaged, their best hope is that cool air will slow its rotting, so they can get it to processors in time to make juice. But it will take weeks to pick all the damaged oranges and the processors are already backed up, leaving much of the Florida citrus industry in a race against time and temperature.
 
Quarter of Crop Lost
''I'd love to be able to dial upstairs and have 40-degree nights and 50-degree days,'' Mr. Abbitt said. But as he spoke, temperatures were already beginning to climb into the 60's.
Some state officials estimate that 25 to 30 percent of the orange crop will be lost in this state where the crop's wholesale value is about $3.8 billion a year. But growers say they cannot estimate the damage until they see how many oranges make it to processing plants. They add that they will not know until spring how much damage has been done to the orange trees themselves.
For consumers, the freezing temperatures will almost certainly lead to an increase in the price of fresh oranges. Price increases for orange juice, however, will be kept down by imports from Brazil.
Here in South Florida, below the main citrus belt, temperatures in the 30's have caused extensive destruction to vegetable farms. Farmers reported damage that ranges from 25 percent to 100 percent of their crops of celery, lettuce, tomatoes, beans and squash.
 
'Little Bald Heads'
''The wrapper leaves are falling off the heads of lettuce,'' said Frank Teets, a salesman for South Bay Growers. ''It looks like little bald heads sticking out of the rows.''
The loss of the vegetable crops means that as many as 50,000 migrant farm workers face the prospect of no work at all for several months.
''They'll bail out the farmers,'' said Greg Schell, a lawyer who represents migrant workers. ''But the farm worker will get none of that.''
He added that many workers would not be eligible for unemployment compensation because some growers had not contributed to the fund. ''They somehow survive,'' he said of the migrant workers. ''I don't know how they do it.''
 
Recovery Just Beginning
For the orange industry, the destruction comes at an especially bad time. Florida was just beginning to regain its share of the market in the face of competition from Brazil. In 1985, 50 percent of the orange juice consumed in the United States was coming from Brazil. In the last year, the figure dropped to 30 percent.
And the destruction comes as the citrus industry here had just recovered from two other severe freezes this decade. Because of the freezes, the citrus belt has been moving south, concentrating in central Florida instead of slightly to the north.
''But there's only so far south we can go,'' Mr. Abbitt said. ''We're limited in terms of the amount of land available, the cost, the quality of the land.''
Oranges begin to be damaged when the temperature drops to below 28 degrees for four hours or more. In many areas of Florida over the weekend, the thermometer dropped to the low to mid-20's for two days.
 
Still Usable for Juice
Damaged oranges are unacceptable for sale as fresh fruit. But if they can be transported to the processor in time, they may still be used for making juice concentrate. Ninety-four percent of Florida's oranges usually end up being used that way.
Growers no longer focus on saving the fruit, devoting their efforts to saving the trees, which is more important economically in the long run.
In Haines City, about 60 miles east of Tampa, Mr. Abbitt and the other members of the citrus growers' association fought with a mix of old-fashioned pluck and new technology. Although only 5 percent of Florida citrus growers still use the diesel-fired heaters known as smudge pots, some members of the Haines City group, which is 80 years old, continue to rely on them.
 
Dirt as Insulation
Others did what is called ''banking the trees,'' piling up dirt around their bases and trunks to act as insulation. Most rely on ''microjets,'' small underground nozzles that bathe the tree roots in currents of water to prevent their freezing.
Nearby, Bob McLean, the head of J. E. McLean and Sons, a grower and harvester whose crop is 75 percent oranges and 25 percent grapefruit, said, ''We're picking frantically.''
Mr. McLean is drawing on about 100 pickers who are available because the strawberry crop in the area, where they would ordinarily be employed this time of year, was 50 percent destroyed.
''I've been here all my life, the fourth generation,'' Mr. McLean said. ''And this is the worst 10-year period in the industry that I've seen.''

HEADLINE: Fixing New York City: Needs Are Awesome

SERIES: New York Rebuilds; Battling Urban Decline - Second of two articles.

BYLINE:  By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
While New York City has begun to dig out from decades of neglect, much rebuilding remains to be done.
The central tasks are fairly clear. The administration of Mayor-elect David N. Dinkins will have to give priority to the schools, bridges and highways, the sewage system and sanitation, many experts said.
But it is uncertain whether the city will have enough money to do the job, and whether it can devise enough new management strategies to get it done, said the experts, including some senior members of the new administration.
 
New Management Techniques
The needs are awesome. Eighty-three percent of the schools are in disrepair, according to a Board of Education study. Fourteen bridges are at least partly closed for repairs. More than 40 percent of the 846 bridges owned and operated by the city are rated poor or fair under the city's rating system, and need renovation. 
All but two landfills have been shut, and the sole remaining large garbage dump, Fresh Kills on Staten Island, could grow as tall as 50 stories by the year 2,000 unless, after years of delay, the city begins construction on five huge incinerators. Mr. Dinkins has called for a moratorium on building the first incinerator, in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, so that alternatives can be studied.
City and state officials have already created several new management techniques to try to address those serious problems.
The city's Department of Transportation, for example, has established a cadre of city engineers and construction workers to repair and maintain bridges. Transporation officials said that by using fewer outside contractors, they were able to save money and complete work faster. A year ago, twice as many bridges - 30 -were at least partly closed for repairs.
To speed school construction, the State Legislature last year created a new quasi-independent agency responsible solely for building schools.
But even if those and other management changes prove successful, New York may not be able to afford all the reconstruction it needs. The city spent $19 billion over the last decade to begin reviving the physical plant, and it plans to spend $57 billion during the next 10 years to put it in good condition.
The Mayor-elect's challenge will be to assure that the city can spend that much. Some people said its long-term fiscal problems will likely force Mr. Dinkins to scale back the rebuilding plan.
''There just ain't no dough,'' said George Sternlieb, the University Professor of Urban Studies at Rutgers University. ''I think the operational mechanisms are finally in place; the issue is what do you feed them with. There is no significant money coming from Washington and Albany, and I think the immediate human problems of the city are going to preclude putting more money into bricks and mortar.''
Others said New York could not afford to retrench. Paul Dickstein, the city's departing Budget Director, said the need to rebuild was so paramount that the new administration should consider raising taxes or reducing other spending, if necessary, to complete the capital program.
''Everything being done is virtually essential,'' Mr. Dickstein said. ''There is not much point in having street cleaners when there are no streets to clean.''
''New York City is going to be very well positioned going into the future, by having a very solid and well-built infrastructure,'' he said, ''and it is going to contrast with many other cities.''
Because the city finances the cost of its construction projects over many years, the deficit in the current operating budget does not pose an immediate threat to the rebuilding effort. But long-term fiscal problems would.
The city floats bonds to finance the capital program, and it repays interest and principal each year out of the operating budget. About 10 percent of the operating budget is now used for debt service, Mr. Dickstein said. In four years, as much as 11.5 percent will be used to repay capital debt.
Many experts expect New York's economy to remain static and social needs to expand. Under those circumstances, they said, it may be difficult if not impossible to maintain so large a portion of the operating budget for debt service. Many said the city would likely be forced to reduce the rebuilding effort or find new revenues to sustain it.
 
Treating Sewage And Trapping Water
A vital part of the future investment will be in the city's water and sewage systems, which have been the beneficiary of billions of dollars in construction over the last decade.
The first stage of a new $1 billion water tunnel is to be completed in 1992, and additional stages are scheduled to be constructed later in the decade.
About $1.5 billion will have to be spent in the 1990's to build large holding areas at all 14 municipal sewage-treatment plants to prevent untreated sewage from overflowing into rivers and bays during heavy rains.
The city will also have to spend another $500 million to compost or incinerate sludge, which it now dumps in the Atlantic Ocean. Congress has ordered such dumping halted by 1991, but municipal officials say they will be unable to meet the deadline.
A decision will also have to be made on another critical matter: finding new sources of fresh water.
The city's reservoirs now have a capacity of 550 billion gallons of water. Consumption goes up an average of 1 percent a year, largely because of the increased use of air-conditioners and other appliances that require large amounts of water. The long-term need for more water is independent of the occasional problems caused by droughts, officials said.
While planners have made no final decisions, the most likely alternative will be to tap the Hudson River, city environmental officials said.
 
Incinerator Plans Stymied for Years
No effort illustrates better how difficult it has become to build large public works than the city's plans for disposing of its garbage. In 1979, the Koch administration proposed to build eight large incinerators. Ten years later, construction has yet to begin.
''It's been a remarkable process, an astounding process,'' the Sanitation Commissioner, Brendan Sexton, said.
The plan has been delayed by environmental, technological, legal and political concerns. After years of studying and debating the plan, the Koch administration won approval from the Board of Estimate in 1984 to build five incinerators, one in each borough. The first is to be constructed at the Brooklyn Navy Yard in the Williamsburg section.
The proposal then survived three lawsuits. For the last four years, the city has been seeking a permit for the incinerator from state environmental officials. Twice in the last two years, municipal officials thought they were about to receive the permit - the last step before construction. Both times they were wrong.
The state's Environmental Commissioner, Thomas C. Jorling, said last year that the city had to improve plans for recycling garbage and for disposing of the ash produced by incinerators.
The Council then passed a bill last March mandating the recycling of 25 percent of the city's garbage. Mr. Jorling said last month that everything about the Brooklyn plant was now in order, except for the question of what to do with its ash.
The city hopes to resolve that matter within six months, probably by arranging to ship the ash to sites outside New York until a local disposal site can be prepared, said Vito A. Turso, a Sanitation Department spokesman.
But the saga is far from over. Mr. Dinkins said during the mayoral campaign that he would impose a moratorium of up to two or three years on building incinerators while planners studied whether more garbage could be recycled, thus reducing the need to burn it. And Mr. Jorling threatened last month to shut the last large city landfill, at Fresh Kills, in two years unless the city complied with his orders to clean it up.
The frustration has begun to show at the Sanitation Department. Mr. Turso described the proposed Brooklyn incinerator as ''the most litigated, most scrutinized waste disposal project in the history of mankind.''
 
A System 'Biased Against Action'
Environmental concerns are just one reason why it is so difficult to build. Many communities are reluctant to accept unpleasant public works like incinerators, jails and homeless shelters.
Legal and governmental safeguards also slow the process. Contract approvals are often required from a half-dozen or more municipal agencies, from the Department of Investigation to the Office of Management and Budget. The requirement to accept low bidders on city contracts helps guard against corruption, but also reduces efficiency because the most reliable contractors do not necessarily submit the lowest bid.
''The system is biased against action,'' said Mr. Sandler, the Transportation Commissioner.
He and others contend that the municipal agencies responsible for much of the rebuilding need more autonomy. He cited management changes, like reducing the work awarded to outside contractors, that have enabled his department to rebuild bridges and roads more quickly and inexpensively than expected.
Samuel I. Schwartz, the First Deputy Transportation Commissioner, noted one example: the Carroll Street Bridge over the Gowanus Canal in Brooklyn. The bridge had to be entirely reconstructed, a job estimated to take 5 years and to cost $3 million. It took a year, he said, and cost $2.5 million.
Mr. Sandler and others are urging the Mayor-elect to consider many more management reforms. But a different concern - money - is likely to dominate debate on the city's rebuilding effort over the next few years. Can it afford to finance $57 billion during the 1990's to finish the job?
Professor Sternlieb of Rutgers said Mr. Dinkins faced a daunting task, particularly since he could not expect much help from the state and Federal governments.
''The city's infrastructure problems are very real,'' he said. ''He will be trying to cope with them in a context in which environmental concerns are at an all-time peak, the capacity to get moving at an all-time low and the money that's around, fundamentally, is self-raised revenue.''

HEADLINE: Neighborhoods in New York Seeing Red Over Blue Videos

BYLINE: By MICHAEL FREITAG

 BODY:
In the last four months, at least 10 stores that specialize in selling pornographic videocassettes have opened in Manhattan. Three are in Times Square, where such merchandise is commonplace.
But four others have opened on Canal Street at the edge of SoHo. Another has appeared on the Avenue of the Americas in Chelsea and two more have turned up among the bistros and boutiques on the Avenue of the Americas in Greenwich Village. And in these communities, particularly the Village, some residents are furious.
''This was a real assault on our neighborhood,'' said Diane Whelton, a spokeswoman for No Times Square in Greenwich Village, a group formed to protest the opening of the video stores. More than 2,000 Village residents have signed the group's petition opposing the stores, she said, and dozens of people have joined demonstrations in front of the shops. 
Mrs. Whelton and other opponents contend that the store owners are test marketing neighborhoods to serve as the city's new pornography center now that Times Square is facing redevelopment.
The store owners maintain that they are just entrepreneurs who have spotted a new niche in the videocassette market. As the cost of the cassettes has declined recently, they say, the demand has risen, and customers seem more willing to buy the tapes in their own neighborhoods.
Mrs. Whelton and other critics insist that they object less to the tapes' content than to the way in which they are being sold - with large, colorful signs covering store windows, proclaiming: ''ADULT MOVIES, XXX!!!'' and ''X-MAS SALE!''
These opponents say such signs will give their community a poor image. And they say they fear that the shops will attract peep shows and other similar businesses to the area while scaring away other merchants.
''We are worried about the impact this kind of store could have on the economic health of the neighborhood,'' Mrs. Whelton said. ''The Village is having serious problems. We have stores that have been empty for more than half a year, even with rents declining.''
Judith Joice, the president of the Greenwich Village Chamber of Commerce, said most of its 500 members were opposed to the video shops. Ms. Joice is the co-owner of the Lion's Head, a neighborhood bar.
''We have a history of accepting just about anything in the Village,'' she said. ''But this is one step too far.'' The video stores, Ms. Joice said, are ''run by sleazy people with sleazy intentions.''
Ygal Mizrahi, who owns Crazy Fantasy Video at 333 Avenue of the Americas near Fourth Street, said the community's complaints are unfair and hypocritical. All he is doing, Mr. Mizrahi said, is selling tapes that have been available for years in most video-rental stores. And, he added, there are plenty of other places in the Village that sell pornographic paraphernalia.
The Pink Pussycat Boutique, which is just around the corner from Crazy Fantasy Video, at 161 West Fourth Street, has been selling ''erotic novelties'' for nearly two decades, Mr. Mizrahi noted.
Karl R. Paley, a retired doctor who has lived in the Village for 42 years, said the Pink Pussycat, as well as similar shops like the Pleasure Chest and the Loft, are not as obtrusive as the video stores. Dr. Paley is president of the Waverly Block Association, which has opposed the video stores.
''We have tolerated porno shops in this area for years, but they have been tolerated because they blend into the whole fabric of the Village,'' he said.
''We are perfectly aware of the First Amendment and do not think that we can censor pornographic stores,'' Mr. Paley continued. ''Our objection is with the appearance and presentation of these stores. They have loud and ugly signs that simply do not represent the kind of ambience that belongs in a landmark district.''
Mr. Mizrahi said he has heard many complaints about the large signs in the window of his store, but he refuses to take them down.
 
'They Are My Neighbors'
''After all, I have to cover the windows with something, or else the children can see in,'' he said. ''And if I put a blank piece of paper there, the store looks closed.''
In October, Mr. Mizrahi and several members of the local community board held a meeting at a restaurant near his store. He agreed to leave the door of the shop closed at all times, so passers-by could not peer in. He also agreed to remove fluorescent signs that the board had found particularly offensive.
''They will have no more problems with me,'' Mr. Mizrahi said. ''After all, they are my neighbors, and we have to live together.''
Mr. Mizrahi said Crazy Fantasy Video, which has been repeatedly inspected by the police, the Fire Department and other city agencies, has received all the appropriate permits. The store has a 10-year lease, he said.
But Fantasy Video World, just a few blocks away at 401 Avenue of theAmericas, at Eighth Street, lost its lease recently and will close within two months, Mr. Mizrahi said. He said the store is owned by his brother, Yoel, who now wants to get out of the video business.
''It's not the way he thought it would be,'' Mr. Mizrahi said. ''You have to put a lot of time into this business.''
 
Police Investigation
Ms. Joice of the Chamber of Commerce said she was pleased to hear that one of the video stores may soon close. But she said she was concerned that another will turn up elsewhere in the Village. She would like the city to pass a zoning ordinance banning such shops from residential neighborhoods, she said.
Ms. Joice said she had asked the police to investigate the video stores for violations of the obscenity laws. ''I am sure they are selling child pornography in there,'' she said. She did not offer any evidence.
Capt. Michael Murray of the Police Department's public morals division said his unit investigated the video stores in the Village after receiving complaints from the community, and it passed its findings on to the District Attorney. He declined to say what had been found.
The state's obscenity laws are very complicated, and convictions are extremely rare, Captain Murray said. What is deemed offensive in one community may be acceptable in another; these standards are ultimately determined by the courts, he said. But the sale of child pornography, which depicts minors engaged in sexual acts, is universally forbidden.
Mr. Mizrahi strongly denied selling child pornography or violating any law. Mr. Mizrahi, a 36-year-old native of Israel who moved to the United States 15 years ago, also denied owning any of the other pornographic video stores.
 
Rows and Rows of Shelves
If many of the video shops look similar, he said, it is probably because the owners are imitating each other, and because all the stores essentially consist of the same thing: rows and rows of shelves piled high with slickly packaged videocassettes.
William H. Daly, director of the Mayor's Office of Midtown Enforcement, which has closed dozens of illegal businesses in Times Square in the last 12 years, said he doubted that the video stores were related to the 42d Street pornography sellers.
The new video stores are probably not the offspring of the sex shops, but a sign of their continuing demise, Mr. Daly said. The sex industry in Times Square, he said, has been hampered by a change in social mores, a widespread fear of AIDS, aggressive enforcement of city ordinances and the advent of videocassette recorders and cable television, which bring pornographic movies into people's homes.

HEADLINE: Judge Thwarts Suffolk's Video-Terminal Law

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT

DATELINE: HAUPPAUGE, L.I., Dec. 27

 BODY:
In a victory for Suffolk County employers, a state judge today struck down a county law that regulates the use of video-display terminals in the workplace.
The ruling came five days before an important provision of the law was to take effect, requiring all computer equipment and office furniture bought by the 170 large employers in Suffolk covered by the law to conform to county standards to protect terminal operators from discomfort.
Business leaders filed suit to overturn the law, the first of its kind in the nation, contending that the measure was an unwarranted intrusion that would discourage new businesses and force existing companies to leave. 
In his decision, Justice John Copertino of State Supreme Court ruled that the Suffolk County Legislature overstepped its authority when it approved the law in June 1988 over the veto of County Executive Patrick G. Halpin.
 
No Decision on Appeal
Justice Copertino said Suffolk had improperly legislated control over workplace safety and health standards that were already covered by state and Federal statutes, which the county cannot supercede.
''Though the legislation is well-intentioned,'' he wrote, ''the Suffolk County Legislature lacked the authority to enact'' the law.
The county's chief deputy attorney, Dennis E. Milton, said the county was reviewing the decision and would decide within the next week whether to appeal.
The law's sponsor, County Legislator John J. Foley, Democrat of Patchogue, said the ruling ''gives a devastating Christmas present to workers in the private sector in Suffolk.''
Business leaders, meanwhile, praised the decision as a first step toward mending a perception outside the region that Suffolk was hostile to economic development.
 
Adequate Eye Care
''We see this as a victory that recognizes the limits on legislative excesses,'' said James L. Larocca, president of the Long Island Association, the region's largest business organization.
Labor groups and experts on workplace safety argued that the law was needed to insure adequate eye care, lighting and other working conditions for employees who used the terminals.
The law applies to operators who spend more than 26 hours a week before the screen at private work sites with 20 or more terminals. The Suffolk law did not address health concerns about low-level radiations emissions from the terminals. The largest companies covered include New York Telephone and the Grumman Corporation.
The first provisions took effect last January, requiring 15-minute work breaks and special training for operators. The most controversial part of the law, a section that would have required employers to pay 80 percent of the cost of eye examinations and glasses for operators, was blocked by a preliminary injunction granted to four businesses by Justice Copertino last year.
When Suffolk enacted its law, many labor groups predicted that it would establish a model for states and municipalities. But the movement failed to gain momentum. Mayor Edward I. Koch of New York, for example, vetoed similar legislation on Tuesday, saying that he had not been shown compelling medical evidence that the terminals posed a serious health risk. That measure would have covered municipal employees only.
Experts on the workplace said, however, that many businesses are voluntarily adopting similar practices.
''The companies are doing it on their own to improve productivity,'' said Louis E. Slesin, editor of VDT News, a trade publication in Manhattan.

HEADLINE: Town Needed People, So It Offered a Bounty

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: ROLFE, Iowa, Dec. 27

 BODY:
Two years ago, hoping to save its businesses and its school, this Farm Belt community put out an invitation for new residents, offering a free lot and $1,200 cash to anyone who builds a house worth $30,000.
Although no one accepted the town's offer, the publicity it generated had the desired effect. About 70 people, attracted by reports of low crime and an easier life style, moved here, increasing the population by almost 10 percent. Their 20 children padded school enrollment to 190. 
Four houses have been built, although none by the transplants, who are happy to rent or buy existing homes at a fraction of the price they were used to paying.
''We paid $4,500 for it, plus $1,500 for the garage,'' Becky Roberts said about her 3,000-square-foot century-old house. ''In Sacramento, it would probably go for $300,000.''
To Mrs. Roberts and her husband, Gary, who moved from California this year for their retirement, this town about 80 miles northwest of Des Moines is just what she and her husband were looking for.
''We were thinking about retiring and moving to a small community, and one morning on the boob tube, here comes the story about Rolfe,'' she said. They visited, liked the place and decided to settle here.
 
Cars Don't Have to Be Locked
''It's real slow here,'' she said. ''People are genuinely friendly. If they call on you or visit, it's because they want to. You don't have to be suspicious of people at your door. You go downtown and find cars parked at the curb, running, with babies in them. In California, you would never leave it unlocked, let alone running with a kid in it.''
For that matter, a car has not been stolen here in three years, said the City Administrator, Dave Jochims.
Alcides and Guelly Mendoza, who came from Brazil by way of the Bronx, were tired of the rush and risk of New York City.
The move was especially good for their four children, three in school and an 8-month-old, said Mrs. Mendoza.
''I like it here,'' she said. ''Here many people look after kids. Everybody takes care of everybody. People here make me feel welcome.''
Until her husband found a job in nearby Pocahontas, Mrs. Mendoza received public assistance for the infant. When she picked up her last check this month, she thanked the welfare workers and added, ''We do not need any more.''
Other families have not been so quick to get on their feet.
Ron Walrod, director of social services for Pocahontas County, said he knows of about a dozen people receiving public assistance in Rolfe.
But Mr. Jochims said most of the newcomers are on their own.
''I know there are families who need assistance, like a lot of Iowans,'' he said. ''Whether we like it or not, these people are not disposable. This is a free society. We're concerned about the people who come here.''
The grain elevator is both the major landmark and the main employer in Rolfe, but there are ample opportunities for skilled workers in nearby communities, Mr. Jochims said. The county unemployment rate is 1.1 percent.
''So far, the businesses have been happy with the workers they've received and I feel good about it,'' he went on. ''People are moving to Rolfe to better themselves.''
After her husband died of a brain tumor two years ago, Penny Hollis, 31 years old, decided she and her four children, ages 3 to 14, needed to get away from New Hampshire.
''I saw this article in a woman's magazine and decided to drive out,'' she said about her move last summer. ''I couldn't get over the openness. I kept stopping the car and getting out so I could see how far I could see. I really didn't check out Rolfe very much. It was the land I loved. I put a down payment down on this house right away.'' But now she has reservations. ''I used to socialize all the time and now I don't know anybody,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Losing $2 Billion - An Accounting Quagmire;
The Lapses by Lincoln's Auditors

BYLINE: By ERIC N. BERG

 BODY:
As Federal investigators press their inquiry into the collapse of the Lincoln Savings and Loan Association, the biggest failure in the current savings industry crisis, a number of regulators, auditors and other experts say accounting and auditing safeguards also collapsed during the Lincoln fiasco.
The debate over the role played by the accountants who audited Lincoln's financial statements centers on one crucial issue: were Lincoln's auditors negligent in failing to detect the savings institution's financial shenanigans earlier, or were the accountants simply misled by Lincoln's management?
The answer is being pursued both by Government investigators and in a Los Angeles court, where the three national accounting firms that served as auditor for the California savings and loan during the 1980's are defendants in a class-action lawsuit. All three firms deny they have done anything wrong.
Regardless of the official outcome, Government officials, auditors and other experts agree that the accounting lapse was rooted in an extraordinary mixture of causes. For the accountants, it meant that traditional practices and rules no longer served as a useful guide. There were three main causes of the lapse:
* The sweeping deregulation of the once-staid savings-and-loan industry by the Reagan Administration. 
* Auditing rules that proved unable to keep pace with change in the industry.
* The fierce competition among accounting firms for the audit business of a client paying millions in fees.
For the accountants, it proved a treacherous combination. Under its aggressive chairman, Charles H. Keating Jr., Lincoln struck dozens of suspect deals, ranging from real estate speculation to ''junk bonds.'' The Government closed Lincoln earlier this year, and the financial rescue will cost taxpayers more than $2 billion. Yet as Lincoln was rushing toward collapse, the auditors nonetheless approved financial statements that now appear to have been seriously misleading.
Indeed, just as the savings industry debacle reflected a systemic breakdown of Government regulation, underlined by the forced resignation on Dec. 4 of M. Danny Wall, head of the Office of Thrift Supervision and its predecessor the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, the story of the Lincoln collapse suggests a fundamental lapse in auditing safeguards.
Some experts say the accounting breakdown in the case might have been inevitable. ''We should not be surprised that this happened,'' said John C. Burton, former chief accountant of the Securities and Exchange Commission and now a professor at the Columbia University Graduate School of Business. ''Whenever you confront substantial economic change in an industry such as savings and loans, you will find auditing problems.''
He added: ''Accounting rules may no longer apply, and auditors are asked to look into things with which they are unfamiliar. And there is evidence that the competitiveness of the accounting firms does increase the risk of auditing failure.''
 
Charges in Los Angeles Suit
The Los Angeles lawsuit charges that throughout the 1980's the three accounting firms that successively served as Lincoln's auditor - Arthur Andersen & Company, Arthur Young & Company and Touche Ross & Company - consistently failed to disclose their own misgivings that the savings and loan's financial reports were questionable or that the firms should have steered clear of so suspect a client altogether. The class-action suit has been brought by unhappy investors who bought the bonds of Lincoln's parent company, the American Continental Corporation.
''There would never have been a public offering of the bonds if the accounting had been correct,'' Stephen R. Steinberg, a San Diego-based attorney for the bondholders, asserted.
Lawyers representing the bondholders also contend that the nominally independent auditors were overly reluctant to press Lincoln about its questionable deals because they did not want to lose a big client. The fee for American Continental's annual audit was $2.5 million, roughly one-fifth of the annual billings of Arthur Young's Phoenix office.
All three accounting firms have denied the allegations and said they would be exonerated in court. They have also said that it was routine, after a financial disaster, for the aggrieved to sue the auditors, as the only deep pocket left.
 
The Arthur Young Audits
Lincoln's Reports Staunchly Backed
Arthur Young has been the accounting firm most under fire as a result of the Lincoln collapse. Arthur Young audited Lincoln and American Continental in 1986 and 1987 when, according to experts working with Federal investigators, Lincoln engaged in the most flagrant accounting improprieties, producing a series of deceptive financial statements.
During those years, the New York-based firm, which recently merged with another large auditor, Ernst & Whinney, to form Ernst & Young, issued unqualified opinions, certifying that Lincoln's financial statements and those of its parent company were accurate and reliable.
Moreover, Arthur Young's partner in charge of the account, Jack D. Atchison, seemed to drop the auditor's traditional stance of independence by repeatedly defending the practices of Lincoln and its corporate parent to Congress and Federal regulators.
 
Auditor's Letters to Senators
For example, Mr. Atchison wrote in March 1987 on Lincoln's behalf to Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and to Senator Donald W. Riegle Jr., Democrat of Michigan and chairman of the Senate Banking Committee.
In his letter to Senator Riegle, Mr. Atchison wrote that Lincoln's unorthodox investment policies had ''led to unusually antagonistic positions and actions by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board toward Lincoln.'' He continued, ''This is difficult to fully understand because Lincoln's strategies have thus far proved successful and have turned an association headed for failure into a strong and viable financial entity.''
And in March 1988, Mr. Atchison appeared before the bank board's Enforcement Review Committee, giving what Representative Henry B. Gonzalez, Democrat of Texas and chairman of the House Banking Committee, called a ''glowing presentation of Lincoln's financial condition.'' Darrell Dochow and Rosemary Stewart, two of the board's senior enforcement officials, testified that Mr. Atchison's presentation figured prominently in their decision not to seize Lincoln until last spring.
 
'An Advocate of Its Client'
''Arthur Young became an advocate of its client,'' said Ronald Rus, a lawyer representing American Continental bondholders. ''Since when does the outside accountant - the public watchdog - become a proponent of the client's affairs?''
In response, William Gladstone, Arthur Young's chief executive and now co-chief executive at Ernst & Young, said the firm had never been an advocate for Lincoln but rather appeared before various groups to justify accounting decisions. Mr. Gladstone said Mr. Atchison's letter had caught him by surprise but that in any case Mr. Atchison was merely responding to questions posed to him by regulators and other officials.
''If we agree with a client on an accounting issue and a regulatory agency questions it, our responsibility as an auditor is to explain it,'' Mr. Gladstone said. ''That's not an advocacy issue; it's our job.''
Mr. Gladstone now says that he wished Mr. Atchison had never written the letters to the Senators on Lincoln's behalf.
Mr. Atchison left Arthur Young in early 1988, after heading the Lincoln and American Continental audits for two years, to become a top executive at American Continental at an annual salary of $930,000, far above what he earned at the accounting firm.
 
Arthur Andersen's Role
Signs of Trouble Unnoticed in 1986
Even in 1986, before Arthur Young took on American Continental and Lincoln as an audit client, there were early signs of trouble, but the warning signals went mostly unnoticed at the time.
In early October, Arthur Andersen had resigned as American Continental's auditor, citing a desire to lessen its exposure to liability from savings-and-loan audits in general. Arthur Andersen's resignation coincided with an examination of Lincoln by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which questioned its accounting.
Though it will be an issue in the Los Angeles court case, Arthur Andersen partners say they had no knowledge of the bank board examination at the time.
 
Little Hint of Problems
And there was little hint of problems conveyed to Arthur Young in October 1986 during a telephone conversation between Mr. Atchison and Arthur Andersen's managing partner in Phoenix, Jack A. Henry. Arthur Young had decided to make a run for the American Continental account, and Mr. Atchison was calling Mr. Henry to find out whether there was anything Arthur Young should know beforehand.
The firms have both said that Mr. Henry asserted Arthur Andersen had no reason to doubt the integrity of Mr. Keating, American Continental's chairman and chief executive. Yet, Mr. Henry did say that Arthur Andersen had become increasingly concerned over the friction that had been developing between Mr. Keating and the savings-and-loan regulators. But the Arthur Andersen partner denied having any big accounting disputes with American Continental, adding that any accounting debates it had with the company had been resolved in the accounting firm's favor.
In the highly competitive Phoenix accounting market, where all the big national firms maintain offices, American Continental was a prized client. And Mr. Atchison of Arthur Young, hearing little to worry him from the Arthur Andersen partner, pursued the American Continental audit account and won it. Mr. Atchison apparently concluded that the risks of American Continental's posing a problem for Arthur Young were minimal.
 
The Civil Inquiry
Andersen Denies Cover-Up Charge
Arthur Young had been on the job barely two months when it found itself with a client whose bookkeeping and internal accounting controls were being questioned.
In December 1986, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, acting on information from savings-and-loan examiners, ordered a civil investigation to determine whether Lincoln, to conceal shoddy loan-underwriting procedures, had backdated loan documents and inserted supporting documents into loan files after the loans were made.
According to the investigators, much of this activity was done by employees of Arthur Andersen, Lincoln's auditor before October 1986. Arthur Andersen says that its employees were not involved in any ''file stuffing'' effort. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is examining the matter, including the accounting firm's involvement.
Investigators are also examining whether, under an arrangement completed in early 1986, Lincoln made interest-free loans to its corporate parent. If such loans were made, they would be a violation of Federal banking laws.
 
S.E.C. Notified in January 1987
In January 1987, the bank board notified the S.E.C. that American Continental may have been issuing misleading financial statements to support its sales of bonds. The S.E.C. has since begun its own investigation into the matter.
In terms of challenges to its judgment on complex accounting, however, Arthur Young did not face a problem until May 1987. That month, the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco, Lincoln's primary regulator, completed its 1986 examination of Lincoln.
In a report that would eventually become the basis for two years of fighting between regulators in San Francisco and those in Washington, the San Francisco examiners recommended that Lincoln take a $130 million write-off to account for overstated profits and unrecognized losses. Since Lincoln's net worth - its assets minus its liabilities - was only $210 million at the time, carrying out the examiners' recommendations would have meant wiping out nearly two-thirds of that net worth.
 
Arthur Young Stunned by Report
The report stunned Arthur Young executives, who just three months earlier, in February 1987, had issued their own report on American Continental - a clean audit opinion indicating that the company's accounting was proper. Now, the San Francisco regulators were saying the accounting was anything but proper. Its professional judgment under attack, Arthur Young reviewed the facts but ultimately chose to stick with its unqualified audit opinion.
The San Francisco regulators' report ''didn't even add up arithmetically,'' Mr. Gladstone explained in a lengthy interview that took place recently at his office in New York. ''It came in pieces, and it had some details but no conclusion.''
While Arthur Young did not know it at the time, other public officials were growing increasingly concerned about the accuracy of American Continental's financial reports.
 
Special Meeting of Bank Board
In May 1988, for instance, the bank board held a special meeting to review American Continental's status. At that meeting, Kevin O'Connell, one of the board's senior financial analysts, complained that American Continental's reliance on ''self-created'' income had increased ''markedly'' since Arthur Young became the company's auditor.
At the same meeting, another bank board member, Lawrence J. White, complained that generally accepted accounting principles were not capturing Lincoln's true financial condition.
His specific concern was Lincoln's accounting for ''acquisition development and construction'' loans. Lincoln would lend developers money as loans and also money to pay the interest on those loans. And it then booked the self-financed interest payments as profit. While such accounting was permitted under generally accepted accounting principles, Mr. White complained that such bookkeeping made it difficult to judge the quality of Lincoln's loan portfolio.
''Given the accounting, it's hard to make good judgments,'' he told the bank board.
 
The Leventhal Findings
Phony Profits Seen In 15 Land Deals
For Arthur Young, however, perhaps the most serious challenge to its competency has come in the form of a study by Kenneth Leventhal & Company, a Los Angeles-based firm of certified public accountants that specializes in accounting for complex real estate transactions.
After American Continental filed for bankruptcy last April, Federal investigators hired Leventhal to review Lincoln's accounting for 15 big land sales, all of which resulted in American Continental's posting big gains on its profit-and-loss statement.
In short, what Leventhal argues is that all 15 deals were misleading transactions in which a profit never should have been reported. In each deal, Leventhal says, Lincoln entered into some form of related transaction that had the effect of either nullifying the deal or making its contribution to Lincoln's income far less than reported.
For its part, Arthur Young replies that the Leventhal report is mistaken on some facts and in its interpretation of the deals and that the accounting treatment of many of the transactions is open to varying opinions. ''Reasonable people can differ on this,'' Mr. Gladstone said.
 
Tax Payments Said to Be Diverted
The deals allowed Lincoln to report taxable income, according to Leventhal. It could then make cash payments to its parent, American Continental, in the guise of the subsidiary's portion of payments to American Continental's tax obligation. But in a racketeering lawsuit, regulators have argued that rather than going to the Internal Revenue Service Lincoln's tax payments were diverted to highly speculative ventures ranging from junk-bond deals to corporate takeovers.
''The 15 transactions we analyzed were accounting-driven deals, created for the appearance of profit,'' Roger A. Johnson, a Leventhal partner, told the House Banking Committee recently. ''They involved barren desert land, miles from the population center of Phoenix, and are likely to be undeveloped during this century. In economic reality, these transactions provided no profit but instead exposed Lincoln to huge economic losses.''
Here are four examples from the Leventhal report, along with Arthur Young's response:
* In October 1986, the U. S. Home Corporation purchased from American Continental 425 acres of Hidden Valley, an 8,000-acre tract of barren land outside Phoenix that American Continental had begun acquiring in 1985. While American Continental booked a $3.3 million profit on the deal, Leventhal concluded that it was phony because the sale included a separate provision requiring American Continental to buy back the Hidden Valley land, which it eventually did. Arthur Young's response: There was no repurchase obligation.
* In March 1987, Lincoln sold 1,000 acres in Hidden Valley to a company known as Westcontinental Mortgage Investment. While Lincoln booked an $11.1 million profit on the deal, Leventhal says the sale was a hoax because Westcontinental received the down payment for the purchase from its corporate parent, E. C. Garcia & Company, which Leventhal contends borrowed the down payment from Lincoln. Arthur Young's response: Documents prove that the loan from Lincoln to Garcia was not used as a down payment for the land purchase.
* In August 1987, American Continental sold 963 acres in Hidden Valley to a concern called Richmond American Homes, a subsidiary of M.D.C. Holdings Inc. of Denver, recording a $13.2 million profit. Leventhal says the sale was a sham because at the time that it was selling the land to Richmond American, American Continental was also financing another company's purchase of land from Richmond American. Since, according to Leventhal, Richmond American would not have had the down payment for its purchase unless it had sold its land, the net effect of the two deals is that American Continental provided Richmond American with a down payment. Under generally accepted accounting principles, that arrangement would have nullified the sale. Arthur Young's response: There was no evidence at the time suggesting that the two deals were linked.
* In a series of transactions beginning in May 1987, American Continental claims to have sold its interest in the profits of Rancho Vistoso, a 7,626-acre planned community outside Tucson, Ariz., for a $15 million profit. Leventhal argued that the deal was accounted for improperly because it involved American Continental's actually swapping its profit participation for land. Arthur Young's response: The profit participation was, indeed, sold - for land.
In its report, Leventhal emphasized that it was commenting only on American Continental's accounting and was not evaluating Arthur Young's audit work. Still the fact remains that Arthur Young approved American Continental's 1986 and 1987 financial statements without qualification, which included accounting that Leventhal now contends was flagrantly improper.
 
The Last Straw
Auditor Refuses A Lincoln Demand
By early 1988, Arthur Young and American Continental were arguing repeatedly over accounting issues. These ranged from the losses that American Continental was booking on its real estate to how quickly the company was recognizing profit. In virtually all instances, Arthur Young maintains, the firm's auditors encouraged American Continental to be conservative, ordering it to reduce reported profits by $20 million in 1987.
But Arthur Young officials said American Continental would not listen, eventually pushing them to a point where they no longer felt comfortable being associated with American Continental's financial statements.
The final rupture came Oct. 5, 1988. At a meeting at Arthur Young's Park Avenue headquarters in New York, American Continental officials learned that Arthur Young auditors would not certify American Continental's 1988 financial statements if they included a $55 million gain the company planned to book following an exchange of assets with Sir James Goldsmith, the British financier.
Despite a presentation on Lincoln's behalf by Sidney Davidson, a renowned accounting scholar from the University of Chicago, Arthur Young's auditors insisted that the asset swap was merely an even exchange that did not merit the recognition of gain.
 
Keating Incensed
Mr. Keating, American Continental's chairman, who also attended the meeting, was incensed. In a private session with Mr. Gladstone, Mr. Keating insisted that Janice I. Vincent, who replaced Mr. Atchison as the Arthur Young partner in charge of the American Continental account, be taken off the engagement. Mr. Gladstone refused.
Ms. Vincent recalled Mr. Keating telling her, ''Lady, you've just lost a job.'' But, she added: ''That did not happen. Rather, he ended up losing an accounting firm.''
On Oct. 13, Hugh Grant, an Arthur Young vice chairman, traveled to American Continental's Phoenix headquarters to ''discuss the engagement,'' Arthur Young officials said. It was at that meeting that Mr. Grant informed American Continental that Arthur Young would no longer be the company's auditor.
 
The Wisdom of Hindsight
Today, Arthur Young officials acknowledge that the American Continental engagement has been filled with unexpected turns, and probably should never have been accepted in the first place.
Yet that judgment assumes the wisdom of hindsight, Arthur Young executives note. Mr. Gladstone insists that once Arthur Young detected problems at Lincoln and American Continental, it stood firm and challenged its client.
''It's not like everything they had recorded Arthur Young waved a wand over and accepted,'' Mr. Gladstone said.
Late in 1988, Touche Ross became the auditor of Lincoln and American Continental, and it is still its auditor of record. In the Los Angeles lawsuit, the firm is charged with associating itself with Lincoln, whose integrity has been questioned for some time. The bondholders contend that Lincoln would not have been able to sell as many bonds as it did without Touche's involvement. A lawyer for Touche said he presumed the firm would defend itself.

HEADLINE: Debate on 'Dollarization' Is Growing in Argentina

BYLINE: By SHIRLEY CHRISTIAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, Dec. 27

 BODY:
The return of runaway inflation and the collapse in value of the national currency have opened a growing public debate over whether Argentina should simply adopt the United States dollar as its money.
Proponents of ''dollarization'' think that such a step would reduce inflation to the minimal levels known by the United States, Japan and Europe because the Argentine Government would lose the capacity to print money to cover its immense fiscal deficits.
Contributing to the argument in favor of a dollar economy is that more than enough dollars are circulating in Argentina's underground economy or tucked away in safes and strongboxes to feed an official dollar economy, should it be created. $5 Billion in Dollars Argentines are thought to have about $5 billion in dollars inside the country, mostly in cash, and something in the range of $50 billion invested outside - representing one of the world's highest ratios of flight capital to the size of the economy. 
Private economists and financial analysts have been talking about the idea - pro and con - for several months, but remarks today by the Economy Minister, Erman Gonzalez, in a radio interview suggested the debate may have found its way into the Government as well.
Mr. Gonzalez said he viewed the idea ''with displeasure'' but said the country was being pushed toward ''dollarization'' by the recent run on dollars coupled with the reluctance of grain exporters to exchange their hard-currency earnings for australs, the local currency.
''Technically, there would be nothing wrong with total dollarization,'' Mr. Gonzalez said, ''but there is something wrong from the standpoint of a country that wants to maintain its autonomy.''
 
Other Effects Are Seen
He also said in the interview that converting to the dollar would probably be followed by efforts to align internal salaries and prices with those of more developed countries. But he added that such changes would be complicated by the less-productive structure of the Argentine economy.
''I am determined to continue defending the Argentine currency and monetary system,'' he said.
Argentina's exchange rate, officially pegged at 655 australs to the dollar until the Government freed the exchange markets two weeks ago, has soared in recent days. In currency trading here, it reached 1,200 australs to the dollar on Friday and 2,000 today, before dropping slightly.
Last February, the austral stood at 17 to the dollar before starting its spectacular slide. As the new Government was taking over in July, the austral had reached a crisis point, trading around 500 to the dollar, but the new Government managed to stabilize it somewhat for the last few months at the 655-austral rate.
The dollar idea has gained increased strength in recent days after the inflation rate began to soar again. It is expected to total 50 percent or more this month and even more in January. Prices are now marked up every day.
 
A Headache for Decades
Although it has been a headache for Argentina for decades, inflation this year has exceeded that in any previous year and the rate has been matched only in few other countries.
Inflation began to soar wildly last February as the economic policies of former President Raul Alfonsin foundered and uncertainty grew over the outcome of the May presidential elections.
Inflation hit a high of almost 200 percent for the month of July alone, the month President Carlos Saul Menem took office, but it then began to fall sharply after he imposed wage and price restrictions and set forth a program to reduce deficit spending, sell inefficient state companies and increase the role of private enterprise. The cost of living rose just 5.6 percent in October and 6.5 percent in November before taking off again this month.
Two other countries, Panama and Liberia, now use the dollar as their currency.
 
Move by Grain Producers
The sharp drop in the value of the austral against the dollar was linked in part to the apparent decision of big grain producers to stockpile, rather than to sell for export, the grain they have been harvesting in recent weeks.
Normally, the producers and exporters sell their grain for dollars, which they immediately convert to australs in the central bank, thereby providing most of the dollars to satisfy exchange needs.
But financial analysts said the leading producers and exporters had decided to sit back and wait because of a combination of lack of confidence in the Government and concern that the dollar would rise even more in the next few days.

HEADLINE: Existing Home Sales Rise, Spurred by Falling Rates

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 27

 BODY:
Sales of existing homes, spurred by a big jump in activity in the South, advanced 3.2 percent in November, climbing at their fastest pace in 11 months, the National Association of Realtors said today.
The real estate trade group said sales of existing single-family homes rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.59 million units last month, the best performance since sales reached a rate of 3.92 million units in December 1988. The 3.2 percent October-to-November sales increase followed a 1.1 percent decline in October. It was the biggest percentage gain since a 4.5 percent rise in August. 
Analysts credited declining mortgage rates for the upturn in sales activity. But they said that housing sales presented a mixed picture with some areas of the country, like the Northeast, hurting because of a rapid run-up in prices in the last several years.
 
Housing Recession Fears
Sluggish sales in high-cost areas has prompted some fears of a coming housing recession, but Norman D. Flynn, president of the realtors group, said the pessimists would be proved wrong.
''People who are predicting hard times for housing are not considering how much prices rose in high-cost areas over the past few years,'' said Mr. Flynn, who cited the Northeast, where the median price is up 85 percent from five years ago.
John Tuccillo, chief economist for the trade group, predicted that falling mortgage rates would continue to bolster home sales in coming months. The national average for fixed-rate mortgages dipped to 9.69 percent last week, down from a high last March of 11.22 percent.
The median price for homes sold in November edged up four-tenths of 1 percent, to $93,000.
In November, the sales increase was led by a 9.2 percent jump in sales in the South, where homes were sold at an annual rate of 1.42 million units in November. Sales were up 3.2 percent in the West to an annual rate of 640,000 units. The Northeast posted a 1.7 percent rise, to an annual rate of 590,000 units. Sales in the Midwest were down 4 percent, to an annual rate of 450,000 units.

Yields Fall In Week

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields of taxable and tax-free money market funds surveyed by IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report declined in the week ended yesterday.
Donoghue's seven-day compounded average yield for a taxable money market mutual fund fell 4 basis points, to 8.19 percent, while the 30-day yield, which usually lags behind market activity, fell 2 basis points, to 8.22 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. 
''On the short end of the market, seasonal year-end factors tend to raise rates around this time,'' said Walter S. Frank, chief economist at IBC/Donoghue. ''The Federal Reserve has eased slightly, and we should see the results of this easing early next year, including a probable decline in the prime rate. But on the other hand we have also had economic news that doesn't contradict a soft landing for the economy, or support the notion of a recession.'' For the next week or two, the whole range of interest rates will be higher than expected, he predicted.
 
Taxable Fund Assets Off
Assets of taxable funds fell $578 million, to $360.2 billion. IBC/Donoghue's analysts said institutional funds were up, but the $1 billion decline in consumer assets more than offset the rise.
The average days to maturity of securities held in managers' portfolios declined by one day, to 41.
Among the general-purpose money market funds with assets of more than $100 million that are surveyed by IBC/Donoghue's, the Dreyfus World Wide Dollar Money Market fund again had the best return, with a yield of 9.15 percent, up a basis point from last week and 96 basis points above the average yield this week.
Tax-exempt assets declined $215 million, to $71.4 billion, as the average seven-day compounded yield increased 4 basis points, to 5.88 percent. The taxable equivalent would be 8.16 percent for investors in the 28 percent tax bracket, and 8.77 percent for those in a 33 percent bracket.
 
Top Tax-Exempt Fund
The top-performing tax-exempt fund in the week was the General California Tax Free Money Market Fund, distributed by the Dreyfus Service Corporation III in Garden City, L.I. The fund posted a return of 6.52 percent, or about 64 points above the average.
By contrast, bank money market accounts were down a basis point, to 6.35 percent, according to The Bank Rate Monitor's national index, while the average yield for a six-month C.D. fell 2 basis points, to 7.93 percent.
Among certificates with longer maturities, an average one-year C.D. was at 7.95 percent, a two-and-a-half-year C.D. at 7.91 percent and a five-year C.D. at 7.92 percent. All were down 3 basis points.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Tax Laws Spur Borrowing Boom

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
IN the era of leverage, its founders do not reside on Wall Street, public perceptions to the contrary. The boom in borrowing can, to a considerable extent, be laid at the doorstep of the Congressional tax law writers.
The tax code has always encouraged corporate borrowing by making interest payments deductible, while it discouraged companies from selling stock by not allowing them to deduct dividend payments from income. In addition, changes in the tax laws over the last several years, while advertised as discouraging takeovers, in fact helped to promote them. The issuance of debt has grown even more attractive because of the way the corporate and individual income tax laws interact. 
Before 1982, corporations might have preferred to sell bonds for tax reasons, but individuals had good tax reasons to prefer buying stocks. A rough standoff may have resulted, argues Hayne Leland, a finance professor at the University of California at Berkeley. Still, enough buyers wanted to buy stock that stock was issued.
But those tax reasons for investors to prefer stocks were reduced in 1982 and eliminated by the Tax Reform Act of 1986, when the preferential treatment for capital gains was eliminated and individual tax rates were lowered.
Indeed, 1983 was the last year in which American companies issued more stock than they bought back. In that year, there was a net issuance of $31 billion, said Laszlo Birinyi, head of Birinyi Associates. Last year, there was a net reduction of $208 billion in stock outstanding, and in the first nine months of this year the shrinkage was $143 million.
The scope of the tax encouragements for leverage may be seen in the $22.5 billion leveraged buyout of RJR Nabisco Inc. That price represented a $9.9 billion premium for shareholders, compared with the market price before the company was put into play by the first offer, Mr. Leland notes in an article in the fall issue of California Management Review, published by the Berkeley business school.
Of that $9.9 billion, Mr. Leland calculates, $8 billion, or 81 percent, was justified by the tax benefits to the company from having tax-deductible debt, rather than nondeductible stock, as the major part of the company's capitalization. Of course, some taxes were paid on capital gains by selling shareholders, so the net loss to the Government, Mr. Leland estimates, is about $6.4 billion.
''For all the lip service paid to increasing efficiency, etc., the deal is based almost entirely on tax savings,'' Mr. Leland concludes. ''The bulk of shareholder gains came at the expense of the Internal Revenue Service.''
When the 1986 tax law was passed, many on Wall Street thought it reduced the relative attractiveness of leveraged buyouts, at least slightly. Specific provisions made it more difficult to bust up acquired companies without paying taxes, and the decline in the top corporate tax rate, to 34 percent from 46 percent, seemed to mitigate the nondeductibility of dividend payments. In effect, Uncle Sam was paying 34 percent of an interest payment, compared with 46 percent before the 1986 law.
But Mr. Leland, drawing on work of Merton H. Miller, an economist at the University of Chicago, argues that those numbers tell only part of the story. Stock market investors expect to get part of their profits in dividends and the rest in capital gains. Those who buy bonds at par and hold them get all of their income as interest.
Before 1986, a top-bracket individual paid 50 percent of any interest or dividends in Federal taxes, but only 20 percent of any capital gains. Thus, that individual valued capital gains more highly.
For an investor who expected to get a quarter of the stock profit from dividends and the rest from capital gains, the net result, Mr. Leland calculates, is that each additional dollar of leverage led to a 22-cent increase in the value of the company to its investors, before 1986. If one considered capital gains to be a more important factor, the figure would be smaller. It was even less before top tax rates were slashed in the 1981 tax act.
But by reducing tax rates in 1986 and eliminating the capital gains preference, Congress raised the benefit of substituting a dollar of leverage for one of equity to 34 cents, Mr. Leland calculates.
The disadvantage of leverage is that debt severely reduces a company's operating flexibility if business turns bad. ''A deeply indebted economy is a fragile economy, subject to collapse in any substantial downturn of business,'' Mr. Leland said.
To end the debt advantage, Mr. Leland said, the Government would need to cut the corporate tax rate, raise the individual income tax rate and reintroduce a tax advantage for capital gains. That prescription is politically unlikely, to say the least.
As a result, the odds are that the leveraging of American business will continue until the lenders are no longer willing to put up the money. And that time may not come until enough leveraged companies have been forced to default.

HEADLINE: World Growth Outlook for '90

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
World economic growth will continue next year, but only barely, a business research group reported yesterday.
The Conference Board's composite leading index for 11 leading industrial countries is inching up at an annual rate of 1 percent, down from 4 percent six months ago and 5 percent a year ago. The leading index is intended to foretell economic activity.
''Throughout the industrial world, the outlook for economic expansion is not very exciting,'' said Edgar R. Fiedler, vice president and economic counselor for the group. ''Although neither a recession nor an inflationary boom is impossible in the months ahead, neither seems probable.''
One of the few countries with any vigor is Taiwan. Its leading economic index is rising at an 8 percent annual pace, the same as three months ago and is up slightly from the 7 percent rate reported six months ago.
Among the other countries included in the Conference Board's international economic scoreboard, the United States index is rising at a rate 1 percent, compared with the 3 percent released a year ago.
Japan's rate is also 1 percent, compared with 8 percent a year ago, and West Germany's rate is 5 percent, up from 4 peercent.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Bill Rates Up Slightly

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
The discount rates on Treasury bills posted moderate gains yesterday, but prices of Government couponed issues were largely unchanged in light trading.
With most primary dealers in Treasury securities having closed their books for the year, what business there was consisted of trying to reduce inventories in a market with few buyers.
''The problem is that everyone in the Street is trying to reduce their long positions at a time when there are few buyers around,'' one dealer said. ''Given a situation where perhaps six of the 40 primary dealers in Government securities will end 1989 in the black, we can't blame our managers for insisting that we square our positions and, in effect, close our books for the year.'' 
 
One-Point Jump in Funds Rate
Not even a sharp one-point jump in the Federal funds rate, which banks charge each other for temporary loans, ruffled the market or influenced prices. Normally, any sharp move in the funds rate would have an immediate impact on short-term interest rates and later on all rates because the funds are the considered the bedrock cost of credit and often a signal of Federal Reserve intentions.
Nor did the Fed's aggressive efforts to add reserves to the banking system affect this basic cost of credit. The reserves were added through systemwide Fed overnight repurchase agrreements.
''The reason the market did not react to the 9 1/4 percent funds rate or the Fed's efforts to add reserves was the technical nature of the crunch and the remedies the Fed applied,'' said William V. Sullivan Jr., senior vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds. ''Today was not only a time of seasonal pressures on bank reserves, but also the end of the two-week banking maintenance period.''
While many banks balanced their accounts last Friday, Mr. Sullivan said, a sizable number apparently did not and had only two days to do so before the end of business today. This caused a frenzied scramble for Federal funds, which produced an extraordinary rise in this rate.
This is often the case every other Wednesday, when the maintenance period ends. It is so called because banks are required to maintain a certain ratio of reserves to deposits with the Federal Reserve. A day or so before this period ends, or even on the last day, banks that find themselves short of reserves borrow the needed funds from banks with surplus reserves. The cost of these overnight loans, known as Federal funds, also determines a wide range of other interest rates, such as the interest Treasury securities dealers pay to finance their inventories.
The funds closed at 9.5 percent after trading at 9.25 percent for most of the session. The funds have been trading at around 8.25 percent in recent days.
''Given the usual holiday pressures on all sectors of the credit market, we expect the Fed funds to stay high for the rest of this week and perhaps well into next week,'' Mr. Sullivan said. ''Meanwhile, the Treasury securities market will also remain semi-comatose until after New Year's Day. Not even a relatively strong overnight rally in Tokyo helped our market.''
Steven R. Ricchiuto, chief economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, said that ''those who expect the Fed to push rates down still have a long wait.'' He added: ''For one, the important economic statistics for December, such as the employment numbers and price indexes, will be greatly distorted by the weather-induced surge in energy and food costs, as well as the return of many strikers to the labor force. The earliest we expect the Fed to act, if at all, is after the preliminary report on the fourth-quarter gross national product is released on Jan. 26.''
 
Rate News Is Negative
Indeed, the only rate news yesterday was negative: The U.S. Trust Company announced that it had raised its broker loan rate by a half-point, to 10 percent, effective immediately. But the Bankers Trust Company, the only other lender to brokers that discloses its loan rate, held its rate at 9.5 percent.
Meanwhile, in late trading, the Treasury's bellwether long bonds, the 8 1/8 percent issue maturing in 2019, was marked up 3/32, at 101 21/32, with the yield easing a basis point, to 7.97 percent.
Among other closely watched maturities, the 7 7/8's of 1999 was up 1/32, at 99 21/32, for a yield of 7.92 percent; the 7 5/8's of 1993 were unchanged at 99 5/32, with a yield of 7.87 percent, and the 7 5/8's of 1991 lost 1/32, to 99 17/32, with a yield of 7.88 percent.
At the short end of the Treasury market, the discount rate on the 90-day bills fell seven basis points, to 7.70 percent; the six-month bills lost six basis points, to 7.59 percent, and the one-year bills were off a basis point, at 7.29 percent.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Off in Thin Trading; 19-Month Low Against Mark

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar drifted mostly lower in thin trading yesterday, dipping to its lowest level since the spring of 1988 against the West German mark.
Currency dealers said the dollar remained under pressure from the continued strength of the mark and from expectations that United States interest rates will decline further because of weakness in the American economy. 
The mark has been on the rise for several weeks amid rapid changes in Eastern Europe. Many economists predict that West Germany's economy will be bolstered as more Eastern European countries, including East Germany, open their doors to the West.
 
Lowest Since May 1988
In late New York trading, the dollar closed at 1.6895 marks, down from 1.7090 on Tuesday. That is the lowest level since May 1988.
Although sentiment toward the dollar remains bullish, dealers said they expected trading to remain light in the two days before the long New Year's weekend.
In late New York trading, The dollar advanced slightly against the yen, trading at 142 yen, up from 141.85 on Tuesday. But it was weaker against the British pound, which fetched $1.6275, up from $1.6265 on Tuesday.
Most European financial markets were closed on Monday and Tuesday for the Christmas holiday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Tuesday's quotes, included: 1.5295 Swiss francs, down from 1.54525; 5.7600 French francs, down from 5.8020; 1.15735 Canadian dollars, down from 1.6005, and 1,263.75 Italian lire, down from 1,272.75.

HEADLINE: Banks' Bad Real Estate Loans Spur Rising Worry of Failures

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 28

 BODY:
Federal regulators and banking experts say they are increasingly concerned that mounting losses from troubled real estate loans could lead to a series of bank failures, straining the Federal insurance program that protects depositors' funds.
The regulators and analysts worry that in a severe economic downturn the losses at commercial banks might overwhelm the deposit insurance fund. That would force the Government to choose between raising insurance fees on the banking industry or rescuing some banks with taxpayer money.
The banks' real estate problems come on top of difficulties from other troubled loans, including losses on lending to developing countries and to other high-risk borrowers.
 
'Are of Real Concern'
L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, has issued stern warnings to bankers that real estate is ''an emerging area of real concern.'' The F.D.I.C. insures individual deposits up to $100,000 at commercial banks and is considered the front line of the Federal safety net. 
''I've been the Cassandra of real estate forecasting for some time now,'' Mr. Seidman told bankers at a meeting in New York this month. ''Unfortunately, events confirmed this view.''
Mr. Seidman and other experts say that in the last five years commercial banks have become alarmingly dependent on real estate loans. Such lending accounted for 25 percent of loans in 1985; it is approaching 40 percent this year. And two-thirds of all new lending is related to real estate.
They note that with $3.22 trillion in assets the commercial banking system is three times as large as the savings and loan industry. The size of the banking sector means that even a limited number of failures could be a drain on the insurance fund.
The weakness of some commercial banks with large real estate loans has been compared to the savings and loan crisis, but the industries are quite different. Savings institutions concentrate on real estate lending; banks have traditionally had much more diversified portfolios, lending to businesses and making personal loans as well as providing mortgages.
No one predicts that the entire banking industry will suffer the depth of trouble that shook the savings industry in Texas, and the experts do not expect a comparable regulatory failure. Bank regulators have a much better record than their savings and loan counterparts in detecting and limiting problems.
Still, regulators are getting tougher with banks in forcing them to set aside reserves for questionable loans.
 
'It's Pretty Damn Bad'
Many bankers are also worried by the effect of bad real estate loans, but most say the problem can be limited. ''It's pretty damn bad, and I hear the regulators are being extraordinarily tough,'' said Malcolm T. Murray Jr., chief credit officer for the First Union Corporation in Charlotte, N.C.
But Mr. Murray said he did not expect any big bank failures. ''There may be some hasty marriages,'' he said. ''But I am not sure the picture is quite as bleak as it has been painted.''
Charles T. Doyle, chief executive of the Gulf National Bank in Texas City, Tex., added: ''I am not overly gloomy. It is not anywhere near the kind of problem we were faced with in Texas.''
Some regulators, among them Robert L. Clarke, the Comptroller of the Currency, are taking a somewhat reassuring tone. They have announced new computer monitoring procedures and systems aimed at detecting problems much earlier at banks exposed to real estate losses.
Yet besides Mr. Seidman, some respected members of Congress on banking matters are also deeply concerned. ''You have a financial system that is at risk, and it is extremely serious,'' said Representative Jim Leach, Republican of Iowa.
 
Two Things Needed
Robert E. Litan, a senior fellow and banking specialist at the Brookings Institution in Washington, said two things were needed ''to turn the banking problem into one of the magnitude of the thrifts.'' In his view, ''you need a moderate to significant recession and a reluctance by Congress to put new money into the F.D.I.C. and allow a lot of insolvent institutions to stay open.''
At this point the F.D.I.C. can easily absorb losses from small failures. But the failure of only a few large banks could cost the fund dearly.
If the insurance fund, which now has about $14 billion, is run down, pressures would first build on the banks to pay higher insurance premiums. Later, Congress would be likely to be asked to approve more money for the fund - money that, as in the savings bailout, would come from taxpayers.
Some analysts have wondered if Mr. Seidman is trying to prepare the industry for what he sees as the inevitable increases in deposit insurance premiums that his agency was empowered to impose under the savings and loan bailout legislation.
''It is conceivable that even a moderate deterioriation could have debilitating effects on the F.D.I.C.,'' said R. Dan Brumbaugh, a financial consultant in San Francisco.
 
A Growing Dependence
What is troubling many experts, including Mr. Clarke, the Comptroller, is the growing dependence on real estate lending over the last half decade.
In the Northeast, the region with the most new real estate lending, many loans went to developers of condominiums and apartment buildings - financing that is always larger and riskier than single-family mortgages - and were issued by larger regional banks. Until recently, the big regional banks were considered the new wave of banking, replacing the huge international banks, like Chase Manhattan, Citibank and Manufacturers Hanover.
The seriousness of the problem in the Northeast seems to have taken even some top officers of regional banks by surprise.
Senior officials at the Bank of New England, for example, were buying stock in the big Boston-based bank, with assets of $31 billion, only weeks before it said it would have to set aside $700 million against possible losses on its real estate loans.
Then last week, only days after the Bank of New England report, three other big Northeast banking institutions - Dime Savings of New York: Midlantic, the second-largest banking concern in New Jersey, and Citytrust Bancorp of Bridgeport, Conn. - said they would create unexpectedly large loan-loss reserves.
The softening in real estate, and the impact on banks, appear to be reaching beyond the Northeast, however. Mr. Clarke has said that his office sees growing weakness in parts of the booming Florida market. Arizona real estate, particularly in Phoenix and Tucson, has plummeted this year. And some experts see the West Coast as vulnerable soon.
 
'Bicoastal Devaluation'
''I look at the possibility that you are going to see a bicoastal devaluation in real estate,'' Representative Leach of Iowa said.
The potential for trouble in the banking industry as a whole is compounded by several factors.
One is the savings bailout itself. For the next five years at least, the Resolution Trust Corporation, the agency created to manage the liquidation and sale of hundreds of ailing institutions, will have more than $140 billion in half-built apartment buildings, undeveloped land, homes and other troubled assets to sell - the equivalent of almost all the assets of the nation's largest bank, Citibank. This prospect will keep prices depressed and tie up investment capital.
Another factor is the condition of the global banking giants. Though banks like Citibank and Chase Manhattan do not have as big a chunk of their holdings in real estate as the large regional banks, they still have their share, and they continue to be bogged down by third world debt.
 
Squeeze on Profitability
Finally, laws that have prohibited banks from diversifying into securities underwriting and insurance, as well as geographic diversification, have placed what Mr. Clarke considers an alarming squeeze on profitability, putting pressure on banks to seek higher-risk investments. Among these investments have been ''junk bonds'' and highly leveraged transactions; the banking industry in recent months has suffered large losses on such loans.
Other regulators said they were concerned about a marked drop in credit standards. Banks' willingness to lend to businesses they might have turned down several years ago creates the potential for high losses.
''We have systemic problems with profitability,'' Mr. Clarke said in an interview last week. ''And the extent to which the necessity for earnings is forcing banks into high-risk lending.''
Some banking experts note that concern about real estate is affecting the way regulators are working. Mindful of the criticism of M. Danny Wall, who resigned recently as the Government's top savings regulator, some examiners are prompted to force banks to take large losses on their real estate holdings to avoid being accused of underestimating the risks or going easy on certain institutions, these experts say.
Some bankers and analysts say the strains are already appearing as regulators try to get a grasp on how much the real estate market has fallen in key areas. ''These markets have deterioriated a lot faster than people thought at midyear, but I feel that in recent months the regulators have turned up the volume too much,'' said James McDermott, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. ''They have become vocal and very visible, and though their point is well taken, they are tending to undermine confidence in financial institutions.'' Citicorp

HEADLINE: Nairobi Factory Gives Women Hope

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NAIROBI, Kenya, Dec. 28

 BODY:
Jacinta Wanjiku, a 30-year-old divorced mother of four children, strides through the tile-making plant on the outskirts of this city, knowledgeably checking on whether deliveries of mortar and sisal have arrived on time for the production schedules. After a recent three-week training course in England she can also check the machines.
Until she came to the tile factory earlier this year, Mrs. Wanjiku was, like the women who are her co-workers from Mathare Valley, Nairobi's notorious slum district, miserably poor.
In Mathare, hidden from the downtown high rises and the suburban lawns of Nairobi's affluent expatriate community, life is usually eeked out by selling discarded bottle tops or waste paper to pay the rent on a shack most Americans would scorn for their gardening tools. 
 
Survival Skills and Grit
But the women of Mathare Valley, usually bereft of husband, employer and never having known Western-style welfare, are considered to have unusual survival skills, managing somehow to keep themselves and a large number of children alive. It is with these skills and grit for life that women from the valley, the poorest of the poor in urban Africa, have been encouraged by the African Housing Fund, an organization supported by 23 African governments, to start and run a tile-making factory.
Thanks to a $250,000 contract negotiated on their behalf by the fund, the women are working round-the-clock shifts to produce and sell roof tiles to a construction company working on a middle-income housing project financed by the World Bank. The women are keeping the profits for housing for themselves that will eventually allow them to leave Mathare.
 
Not Much Changes for Women
Despite the emphasis by Western-run development projects in the past decade on helping the women of Africa, little has changed in the lowly status of women. Often, the critics say, the well-meaning development efforts are directed to helping women win a better position in the informal sector -producing handicraft, for example -where the proceeds are small and there is little chance in improving women's actual living circumstances.
The Humama tile factory, named after a long-existing women's group in Mathare Valley, is an attempt to bring poor women straight into the formal sector economy. And while many development projects work on the premise that food, health and education are the basics, the African Housing Fund believes that in Mathare, at least, moving out of the shacks, and their disease and crime-ridden surroundings, is the first priority.
''Before I came to the factory, I was taking care of the children, staying with people and making some dolls and leather bags,'' said Mrs. Wanjiku. ''Maybe I'd make a hundred shillings a month and then you'd buy charcoal with it or cabbages and take them to the market to sell.'' $33 a Week, Not Cabbages As a shift supervisor, she now earns 675 shillings every two weeks, or about $33, an amount worked out according to how many tiles the inspectors from the building contractor accepts. When the factory, a long, open-sided pitched roof shed with a wooden frame, opened in February and the women were new to the tile trade, many tiles were rejected for imperfections and the pay was less.
Four male technical trainers, graduates of the National Polytechnic and specialists in such fields as electrical engineering, were hired by the African Housing Fund to help train the female supervisors. Gradually, the male trainers are being withdrawn.
Eighty-five women work at the factory, each chosen by the 230 members of Humama women's groups in the Mathare on the basis of their financial need and their skills. Perpetua Omary, 25 years old, the secretary of the Humama group, so poor she slept in the alleys of Mathare, was known for her diligence at keeping good notes of the group's meeting. She was chosen as bookkeeper for the project and sent to Kenya Women's Finance Trust for business management training.
She showed a visitor impeccably kept books of accounts, detailing wages and inventory. From time to time, she visits the African Housing Fund's headquarters in Nairobi to enter her records on a computer. Mrs. Omary, a shy woman who can now afford a fake pearl necklace and wears a white laboratory-style coat to protect her new dress, said her husband beat her when she went for training. She left him, she said.
Mrs. Omary and Mrs. Wanjiku are also lucky enough to be among the 40 women chosen to live in temporary housing put up at the factory site, a privilege that means they no longer have to endure the hardships of Mathare, where a recent visitor was protected from pickpockets by a flank of six women from the Humama group acting as bodyguards.
Mrs. Wanjiku said the factory site, about four miles from Mathare was safer in another way. ''The women would get drunk in Mathare. Here there is no time to get drunk,'' she said. ''The opening of the factory is good for the ladies. We are eating well and have clothing.''
 
Better Food and Clothing
To those who still live in Mathare, the new earnings from the factory make a big difference in their ability to buy better food and clothing, if not better housing. A 30-year-old woman who travels to the factory every day showed a visitor the 15-by-8-foot tin lean-to she lives in with her five children. Before being chosen to work in the factory, she spent six months in jail after the Nairobi police swept through Mathare picking up people making changa, the alcoholic brew of maize and sugar that is illegally made as a means of making money.
The African Housing Fund has persuaded the Nairobi City Commission to give some land, left over from a middle-income housing scheme to the Humama women's group. There, from their knowledge of tile making and the profits of the factory, they will construct their own houses. Mrs. Wanjiku said she now sees the possibility of having a clean and safe home, once a fantasy.

HEADLINE: Kenya's Plan for Tower Annoys Aid Donors

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NAIROBI, Kenya, Dec. 28

 BODY:
Kenya's major financial donors, including the United States and Japan, have expressed their disapproval of plans to build a 60-story, $200 million office tower, which they say the country cannot afford.
The donors believe the expenditure on the building, which has also become a cause celebre here on environmental and political grounds, violates the spirit, if not the letter, of agreements that Kenya has with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
The $160 million loan from foreign banks that the Government has said it will guarantee, as well as a $40 million local loan, breaks an agreement that Kenya will keep its economic house in order and its commercial loans at a minimum, diplomats here said.
While the major donors have not yet threatened to cut their financial aid, it could come to that, the diplomats said. If the parliamentary bill in which the Government guarantees the loans breaks the agreements with the World Bank and the I.M.F. hundreds of millions of dollars of aid could be in jeopardy. 
President Daniel arap Moi annnounced that the 60-story tower, which would be the tallest office building in Africa, would house the headquarters of the governing Kenya African National Union and a media center run by the party. He has defended the project as a prestige edifice for Kenya and contends that its position in what is now a tree-laden downtown park is environmentally sound. The building will feature a larger-than-life-size statue of Mr. Moi.
 
Other Loans Taken Out
Until now Kenya has been praised by Western donors for being fairly prudent in its borrowing policies. But in the last few months commercial loans have been taken out not only for the building but also for aircraft and spare parts for Kenya Airways, a gas pipeline and sugar factory equipment. The loans total about $400 million, twice the size of Kenya's foreign exchange reserves.
The loan for the office tower is far the most troubling because it is not only the biggest but is money that ''could otherwise be used for the productive sector,'' a diplomat said.
The loan also comes when the Kenya economy is not looking as perky as it once did. In a public address here, the charge d'affaires of the United States Embassy, George Griffen, noted that Kenya's economic growth is expected to drop from 5.2 percent in 1988 to 4.9 percent in 1989. Foreign investment is continuing to decline, he said.
In an address to a group of senior Kenyan officials, a Japanese diplomat warned about the effect of the building loans on Kenya's balance of payments at a time when the prospects for foreign exchange earnings were not good. Japan is Kenya's largest donor, far outstripping the United States and even Britain, the former colonial power.
 
'Politically Desirable'
Western diplomats said that when they make their objections to senior Kenyan civil servants it is acknowledged that the building is economically undesirable but ''politically desirable.'' This is interpreted to mean that President Moi is determined to have it built and that no one within the Government has the power, or the courage, to stop it.
When the new United States Ambassador to Kenya, Smith Hempstone Jr., made his first call on the Finance Minister, George Saitoti, recently, the wisdom of the project was broached. Professor Saitoti said that donors were always urging Kenya to become more competitive and that to do so Kenya, like Hong Kong once did, needed a major office tower.
The leader of an environmental group, Prof. Wangari Maathai, tried to stop construction of the building by taking the issue to the High Court. But the case was thrown out on the ground that the professor had ''no right of action.''
Days later, President Moi attacked Professor Maathai, saying that as a woman she had no right to criticize. The African tradition, the President said, was for women to respect men. The next day, the Nairobi police turned up at her offices and ordered her organization out of the premises it had occupied for 10 years.

HEADLINE: Kinsman From U.S. Is Taking Greece by Storm

BYLINE: By PAUL ANASTASI, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ATHENS

 BODY:
Reversing America's low-profile diplomacy in Greece, he insists on braving the threat of terrorism by displaying the American flag wherever he goes. He does not hesitate to step into the crowd to cheer at basketball games, and he jokingly reassures Greeks that he, like most of them, is an islander - from the island of Manhattan.
After 15 years of strained relations between the United States and Greece, both members of NATO, easing tensions between the two nations may well have a lot to do with the unorthodox tactics of a Greek-American New Yorker: Michael Sotirhos, the new American Ambassador to Greece.
Mr. Sotirhos, 61 years old, arrived in Greece in September and, much to the dismay of the traditionally hostile Greek press, has plunged into a public relations campaign that his predecessors would never have attempted. In several cases, he has left his Greek audience crying for more. 
Greece first got a hint of the Ambassador's new approach when he turned up at the funeral of Pavlos Bacoyannis, the chief spokesman in Parliament of the conservative New Democracy party who was killed by far-left terrorists in September. For the first time in years, the American flag flew from the Ambassador's armored limousine. Mourners broke ranks and burst into applause at the sight.
 
Visit to Communist Headquarters
Similarly, it was front-page news when the Ambassador scored another first by visiting Communist Party headquarters to talk with the party leader. He next turned up at a hastily summoned town hall reception for Boris N. Yeltsin, the maverick Soviet legislator, while the Soviet Ambassador failed to appear.
Not only has Mr. Sotirhos been shaking up the political status quo with his maneuvering, but he has also managed to capture the public's attention with his style.
Recently, he broke with protocol by strolling onto the court to greet the stars of Greece's top basketball team. On another occasion, he mingled with fans at a heated soccer game. In both cases he was applauded and even embraced by fans.
As evidence of his adherence to the Greek Orthodox faith, Mr. Sotirhos attends Mass every Sunday at churches in Athens and sometimes sings along with the choir. Always, he wears an American flag pin in his lapel.
''We're going to take every necessary security precaution, but we're not going to hide,'' a diplomat recalls the Ambassador telling staff members. ''Having armored cars and bodyguards, that's security. Not flying the flag is hiding.''
 
A New Approach
The Ambassador's new approach differs considerably from diplomatic practices adopted since 1974, when simmering anti-Americanism and terrorist attacks compelled most Americans to maintain a low profile.
Now, Mr. Sotirhos has ordered that the American flag fly on all occasions. He has encouraged diplomatic personnel to widen the circle of leaders they meet to include Communists and to seek contact with the general public.
At meetings with American servicemen, he urges them to emphasize rather than hide their official American status. ''Go out, go to the countryside, find the mayor and introduce yourself as an American,'' he personnel, according to the diplomat.
''Anti-Americanism has been declining for the past few years,'' another foreign diplomat said. ''But the new Ambassador is accelerating the gradual decline of anti-American sentiment and taking it one step further to revive traditional pro-Americanism among Greeks.''
The United States and Greece had warm relations in the years after the World War II, largely because of American military and economic aid and the fact that many Greeks had relatives or close friends in the United States. But American tolerance of the right-wing dictatorship, which ruled Greece from 1967 to 1974, and of the Turkish invasion and continuing occupation of Cyprus led to a reversal of sentiments, violent demonstrations and terrorist attacks. More Greeks Favor U.S. Matters have improved in recent years. According to Eurodim opinion polls, an independent polling bureau, 59 percent of Greeks questioned in March would like an improvement in Greek-American relations, compared with only 31 percent in March 1981. But Panayotis Dimitras, the director of the bureau, says research shows that one in three Greeks today remains unreservedly hostile to the United States and unconditionally wants the expulsion of the American bases and Greece's withdrawal from NATO.
While developments in Eastern Europe and the decline of Communist domination may be one coincidence explaining Mr. Sotirhos's warm reception, the Ambassador also has the advantage of being the first Greek-American in the post. His wife, Estelle Manos, is also Greek-American, and both speak Greek fluently.
The advantage of language and the ethnic connection is evident in most of the Ambassador's public appearances. One witness recounted an incident when Mr. Sotirhos, questioned by an elderly couple in the streets of a small town, informed them that his father was from the island of Kythira and his mother from the island of Milos.
''So you are a Nisiotis, an islander, like us?'' the couple asked him.
''Yes,'' the Ambassador replied. ''I'm from Manhattan.'' A Background in Business Born in New York City, Mr. Sotirhos studied business at City College and founded Ariston Interior Designers. He was also a partner in Marta Realty and Hampton Properties of New York. He served in numerous public and political posts and received honors ranging from the man of the year for the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation to the Republican Party's ethnic man of the year. His last assignment was as Ambassador to Jamaica.
So far, Mr. Sotirhos's public diplomacy in Greece seems to be paying off. Both the conservatives and the Socialists have indicated acceptance of his proposal for extending the May deadline on the expulsion of the American bases, thereby allowing time to renew the accord. And though he has not won agreement from the Communists on the bases, he broke new ground when the party's leadership conceded that economic and cultural exchanges between Greece and the United States should increase.
''The Ambassador deplores the poor state of Greek-American relations over the last 15 years,'' another senior diplomat said. ''He feels that too much time has been wasted on such issues as the bases and terrorism. Instead, he wants to concentrate on bilateral ties, on strengthening educational and economic exchanges.''
''He's not a career diplomat but a practical businessman,'' the diplomat said. ''He puts protocol aside and gets things done.''

HEADLINE: China Line: No Thawing

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIJING, Dec. 28

 BODY:
Government anxiety over the domestic impact of the fall of Nicolae Ceausescu in Rumania makes it less likely that the Chinese leadership will respond substantively to President Bush's request for the easing of martial-law restrictions before Congress returns to Washington on Jan. 23, ready to do battle with Mr. Bush over his overtures to Beijing.
Mr. Bush drew significant criticism at home early this month when he sent his national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, to China, six months after the Government's crackdown on the student-led democracy movement. The President felt it was time to begin to restore relations with China, and Mr. Scowcroft, saying he came as ''a friend,'' urged the Chinese to lift martial law and end the repressive measures that followed the June killings.
The criticism of an American ''kowtow'' to a tarnished Chinese leadership heightened when it was revealed that Mr. Scowcroft had also visited Beijing in July, barely a month after the killings and despite a White House ban on high-level contacts. 
 
Congress and Bush at Odds
Legislators vowed to pass laws imposing new sanctions against China when they returned to work. Mr. Bush then proceeded to lift some economic sanctions on doing business with China.
American officials said they wanted the Chinese to lift martial law, stop the continuing series of investigations, trials and executions, restore normal information flows to Western embassies and allow a noted dissident and astrophysicist, Fang Lizhi and his wife, who had sought refuge in the American Embassy here, to leave the country.
The Chinese agreed to allow a Voice of America correspondent to work again in Beijing, repeated an earlier promise not to sell medium-range missiles to Syria and softened their invective about the United States and Mr. Fang, whose case still appears to be under serious discussion.
But senators and members of Congress were already saying this response was insufficient to justify Mr. Bush's gamble, which was fast becoming a central issue for Democratic Party criticism of the President when the invasion of Panama and the upheaval in Rumania diverted attention from China.
 
China Increasingly Isolated
Asian and Western diplomats here agree that Mr. Bush remains dependent on Beijing to provide some return on his diplomatic and political investment, and that after Rumania, an increasingly nervous and isolated China is less likely to reciprocate.
Watching the collapse of Communism in much of Eastern Europe, China had drawn closer to Mr. Ceausescu, pledging ''militant unity'' and ''revolutionary friendship'' with an old-style Stalinist who had maintained close relations with Beijing during the Chinese-Russian split.
Diplomats and students say security forces here were placed on alert and reinforced after Mr. Ceausescu's spectacular fall, with instructions to monitor any student gatherings and even to follow any groups of students who left the campuses.
 
Student Posters Ripped Down
In the last few days, at least three posters have gone up at Beijing and Qinghua universities, students said. The posters were quickly ripped down. At Beijing University on Saturday, two days before Mr. Ceausescu's execution, one poster called him a ''lost dog,'' and suggested that he might be coming to China to join four other dogs - Deng Xiaoping, the senior leader; Prime Minister Li Peng; President Yang Shangkun, and the party chief, Jiang Zemin.
At Beijing University on Wednesday, according to The Associated Press, some students hissed at the State Council spokesman, Yuan Mu, when he came to answer questions from a ticket-only audience of some 300. When asked about Rumania, Mr. Yuan, standing up and banging his hand on the table, said, ''No matter what the situation is in the rest of the world, China will always walk the path of socialism, uphold the socialist flag and adhere to the leadership of the Communist Party of China.'' #3 Factors Blamed for Collapse As the party struggles with the aftermath of Rumania, the tone of argument is becoming increasingly aggressive. Two weeks ago, in a high-level party meeting to discuss Eastern Europe, the collapse there was put down to three factors: the influence of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union, who is regarded as something of a dangerous madman; the presence in Eastern Europe of ''uneradicated bourgeois and social democratic elements,'' and ''the interference in internal affairs'' by capitalist countries, in particular the United States.
The feeling, one party member said, is of defiant pride: that without China, there would be no true Communism surviving.
''This is not a time to expect concessions from the Chinese leadership,'' a senior Western diplomat said. ''They've got enough to worry about without lifting martial law. Bush may have been right in theory, but it seems he may have misjudged his timing.''

HEADLINE: Once-Prized Area Struggles To Recoup Quake's Losses

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 28

 BODY:
When night falls and lights go on in houses throughout the city, whole blocks of the Marina district stand black, the rows of dark windows mute testimony to the damage left behind by the Oct. 17 earthquake.
''It's a ghost town,'' said Bob Mulhern, owner of a neighborhood bar where the Marina's remaining residents gather to commiserate about the cracks in their foundations, the contractors shoring up their houses, the patina of dust that coats everything they own and the rumble of jackhammers and backhoes that still clog their streets.
Residents, merchants and realtors estimate that 3,000 people, 15 percent of the Marina's population, have quit this neighborhood on the edge of San Francisco Bay, one of the city's most prized addresses until two and a half months ago, when dozens of buildings set on unstable landfill buckled, collapsed or burned in the quake.
The setting is no less spectacular these days, with the Golden Gate Bridge and the Marin Headlands in the distance, yachts bobbing in the harbor and sunsets that wash the sky with bright strokes of pink and orange.
 
Now a Desolate Place
But the Marina is now a desolate place. Scattered throughout the area are muddy, vacant lots where apartment houses once stood, condemned buildings that are empty until they are restored to safety and structures declared habitable but no longer attractive to the young professionals who once rented here. 
''If you look at the mailboxes, only about 50 percent of the names are left, and I'm sure only a quarter of us are still in the building,'' said Gene Ann LaMoria, who is about to move from an apartment on Cervantes Street, one of the hardest hits blocks in the Marina, to a condominium across the bay in Sausalito. ''On bedrock,'' she noted.
By and large, it is the young renters who have fled the Marina, leaving behind the elderly men and women who will not uproot themselves after a lifetime in the same place or who cannot afford to move from rent-stabilized apartments. Also wedded to the Marina, at least for the time being, are the homeowners who have sunk their savings into houses that ranged in value from $600,000 to several million dollars before the quake and would now sell, some realtors say, for a third less.
The exodus of renters has been costly for neighborhood merchants, who depended on the free-spending young residents. And outsiders have stayed away from the Marina shopping strip, initially because repair work on nearby buildings, gas lines and water mains made the area a maze of detours and roadblocks, and more recently because the scars of the earthquake are depressing and unsettling.
 
'A One-Two Punch'
''It's a one-two punch,'' said Harold Hoogasin, a florist and president of the Marina Merchants Association, referring to the loss of business from both residents and nonresidents. ''And I can't in my heart blame folks. Who wants to look at devastation?''
The neighborhood has lost vibrancy in other ways as well. There are still joggers and kite-fliers on the Marina Green, a strip of parkland that borders the bay, but their numbers are way down since the quake temporarily turned the grassy area into a staging ground for utility crews and the site of makeshift showers for residents without hot water. Utility service was restored around Thanksgiving, but the Green remains marked by the temblor, its once-flat surface buckled and its running paths cracked.
''The young guys and gals, the joggers and the bicyclists, you don't see as much of that anymore,'' said 66-year-old Bernard Boren, who has lived in his Marina apartment for 25 years and has no intention of leaving.
So far, landlords with vacant apartments have resisted lowering rents to attract new tenants, largely because local rent control laws would then lock them into annual increases of 4 percent on a smaller base. ''For Rent'' signs abound, some advertising the available apartments as ''Safe.'' Several local realtors said the current vacancy rate is 60 or 70 percent, as against 2 percent before the quake, although they assumed the area would regain its popularity as time passed and memories of the earthquake receded.
Homeowners, unlike renters, have shown no signs of fleeing the neighborhood. Many admit in private that they have no choice but to stay, given the depressed value of their houses. But to say that out loud would make a bad situation worse, so most homeowners declare that they love the Marina for its beauty, would not dream of leaving and are not frightened at the prospect of future earthquakes.
''It's basically a great area,'' said Audrey DiFilippio, a homeowner. ''Sure some people left, but the initial outpouring, that's over now.''
Mr. Mulhern, the bar owner, is skeptical. ''They're so stuck that they have to think positively,'' he said. ''I know that if they could get a fair price, 30 percent of them would sell. They can't, so they'll do rehab, wait it out, pray nothing happens for two years and then put the house on the market.''
 
Instant Experts on Construction
In the meantime, it seems, everyone here has become an instant expert on construction techniques and soil conditions related to earthquakes. Homeowners talk incessently of retrofitting and liquification, arcane vocabulary that has become commonplace since the quake.
Houses that cracked or toppled are now propped up on wooden cribbing while new foundations are laid beneath them. Houses that withstood the quake are getting plywood shearing in the walls and 8-inch bolts in their foundations to secure them better next time around. People who can afford it have hired soil engineers to drill holes in their backyards searching for bedrock, which is 40 feet below the landfill on certain lots and 265 feet down on others. The rest of the residents are waiting impatiently for the results of soil tests being conducted by Federal, state and local governments.
These bleak winter days, the streets here are often empty except for construction workers, movers and tourists, who since the quake have flocked to the Marina with their cameras to record the destruction. The tourists poke their noses in open doors to watch the progress of construction, touch the wide cracks in the stucco facades and pose for pictures before the inspection notices that categorize houses as safe or unsafe for habitation.
There are 11 vacant lots in the Marina district where collapsed buildings once stood, including one at the corner of Beach and Divisadero Streets, where millions of television viewers watched the city's most spectacular blaze on Oct. 17, and another at Filmore and Cervantes Streets, where an infant and two adults died in the rubble of a three-story building. It is this empty lot that has become an evolving tableaux of the neighborhood's suffering in the months since the earthquake.
At first, the lot on Cervantes Street was heaped with the possessions of the 40 people who had lived there: golf clubs and lampshades, a vacuum cleaner and an empty bleach bottle, dated copies of Life magazine and the attachments for a Cuisinart food processor.
Then the debris of daily life was cleared away and an angry sign took its place, handwritten by an unknown author on a piece of plywood: ''People like you with your children coming to our neighborhood to take pictures is truly sick.''
Now, new fencing keeps the tourists away and the anger seems to have cooled, giving way to a quiet sadness. Several white carnations are laced in the steel mesh and a Christmas tree stands in the center of the lot.

HEADLINE: FLORIDA GOVERNOR SEEKS DISASTER AID

BYLINE: By ALAN JUDD; New York Times Regional Newspapers

DATELINE: TALLAHASSEE, Fla., Dec. 28

 BODY:
Gov. Bob Martinez sought Federal disaster aid today for Florida farmers whose crops were damaged in the statewide freeze last weekend.
Mr. Martinez asked the Federal Agriculture Secretary, Clayton Yeutter, to approve low-interest disaster-relief loans to Florida farmers, many of whom saw crops wiped out as temperatures plunged.
Calling the freeze ''devastating'' to the state's agriculture interests, Mr. Martinez said in a letter to Mr. Yeutter, ''Preliminary damage reports show that the freezing temperatures caused extensive damage to the citrus, sugar cane and vegetable producing regions, as well as heavy losses to ornamental crops, nurseries and tropical fish breeders.'' 
Mr. Martinez, who did not give an estimate of total losses, also declared all 67 Florida counties to be disaster areas as a result of the freeze.
 
U.S. Survey of Losses
Federal agriculture officials will survey losses in each county before determining whether Florida farmers qualify for disaster loans from the Farmers Home Administration.
Mr. Martinez has not yet decided whether to ask President Bush to declare the state a disaster area, said Jon Peck, the Governor's press secretary.
If the President takes that action, it would make low-interest loans available to other Floridians who suffered losses, not just farmers, and would provide emergency unemployment benefits to farm workers who were put out of work by the freeze.
State officials need detailed, county-by-county damage reports before Mr. Martinez could seek disaster aid from the President, Mr. Peck said, and the Agriculture Department's survey will provide that information.
The two-day freeze severely damaged citrus and vegetable crops deep into South Florida. Some citrus growers have estimated that they lost at least 40 percent of their crops, and many vegetable crops were wiped out.
It will take agriculture officials three to four weeks to gather the information Mr. Yeutter will use in deciding whether to grant disaster aid, said Wilbert Campbell, director of the Farmers Home Administration's emergency designation staff in Washington.
Disaster loans carry a 4.5 percent interest rate, and farmers may take as long as 20 years to repay. Farmers could receive loans no greater than their actual losses, as high as $500,000.
Today Mr. Martinez also extended an emergency order allowing trucks hauling fruit and vegetables to processing plants to exceed weight limits on state highways.

HEADLINE: Tempers Rise Over Fate of Rare Book Collection at Harvard

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Dec. 28

 BODY:
A frozen hush lies over the Charles River here in the holiday lull, but tempers on both banks remain hot over the future of a rare-book collection established 51 years ago at the Harvard Business School.
The feud centers on the Kress Library of Business and Economics, a trove of 37,000 economic history texts, some of them hundreds of years old. The collection, housed in the business school's Baker Library, is regarded as one of the world's finest. It was begun in 1938 with money given to the school by Claude Washington Kress, one of three brothers who made a fortune in dime-store retailing. 
Now some say the Kress legacy is threatened by a tougher attitude toward the bottom line, both at the business school, on the Boston side of the river, and in the rest of the university's library system on the Cambridge side. A reorganization of Baker Library has been carried out, merging the Kress collection staff with those of other archival materials. Some fear the change is the first step toward making the Kress collection inaccessible, since library visitors often require substantial assistance in using rare books.
The university's various graduate schools and faculties are set up as separate entities, each with its own budget that is controlled by the school. The business school's library budget is independent from the budget of the rest of the university's 12-million volume library system. Thus, the handling of the Kress collection is mostly the province of the dean of the business school, John H. McArthur. The dean could not be reached for comment. A spokeswoman for the business school said he does not speak to reporters. #4 Quit in Protest So far, three of the five staff members who oversaw the Kress collection have resigned to protest the changes, as has the associate director of Baker Library. A delegation of professors urged the university's president, Derek C. Bok, to intervene and protect the collection. In the absence of a declared plan for the collection, rumors are flying. Some reports have the collection being moved to a storage building in Southborough, Mass., or locked away in favor of microfilms.
''There has been an almost spontaneous cry of dismay,'' said David S. Landes, a professor of history and economics who met with Mr. Bok over the future of the collection. ''This was clearly intended to be a secret operation, and the business school is surprised and discommoded by this reaction.''
Mary Chatfield, the head librarian at Baker Library, said no final plan had been settled upon. ''I'd really like to allay these rumors that we're the Hunnish horde over here, doing some dreadful thing,'' she said. Long-term plans call for a renovation of the library building in the next 10 years, and all its books will be removed while that work is carried out, she said. ''We wanted to make sure our most rare and fragile materials are handled with a lot of care,'' she said.
The controversy is fed by disagreement over who uses the collection and who ought to pay to sustain it. In meetings last summer, officials at the business school ''said the Kress collection needs to be rationalized,'' said its former curator, Ruth R. Rogers. ''The collection stops at 1850, and much of it is in French, German or Italian,'' she said. ''More and more, it is not what the school is doing.''
Others say most of the collection's users are from outside the business school, and therefore another wing of the university ought to support it.
 
Merging of Staffs
During the summer, school officials announced a plan to merge the Kress staff with those of Baker Library's manuscripts and archives collections.
''It was brought to our attention that we should reorganize, and so we formed a department of special collections,'' Ms. Chatfield said. ''One of the main reasons for this consolidation was to oversee all the preservation activities that were going on in Baker Library. It was an opportunity to leverage our staff.''
Others say the reorganization was dictated by budget constraints that are afflicting libraries everywhere. ''In any kind of an organization, there are going to be reductions of staff, but that is not going to be a mortal blow,'' said Thomas K. McCraw, an economic historian and professor of business history. ''Every library in the world is going through a budgetary crisis.''
The director of Harvard's library system, Sidney Verba, said he hoped the Kress collection would remain accessible to scholars and students. ''If the business school doesn't keep it, it would be preferable to move it to another location on the campus,'' he said. ''I'm very anxious to see that the collection is maintained in a way that people can get access to it, and I would very much prefer to see it stay in Baker Library.''
But the decentralized manner in which Harvard's schools are run means the administration has little to say about what happens except in the most extreme case.
''The dean of the business school makes the decisions,'' Professor Verba said, ''but if it were a major decision, such as disposing of the Kress collection, it would have to be done in consultation with the president and with me.''

HEADLINE: Why Hong Kong Is Turning Back Boat People;
Illegal Immigrants

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''Sinking the Boat People'' (editorial, Dec. 9) suggests that Hong Kong is in violation of Article 33 of the United Nations Convention on Refugees by repatriating Vietnamese boat people.
But it is precisely this article - that no one fearing persecution because of race, religion, membership in a particular social group or political opinion should be forced to return to his country - that provides the basis for finding many of the Vietnamese boat people illegal immigrants.
This determination has been made after exhaustive screening and appeals designed and monitored by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, which may still declare any person to be a refugee, even if that person has been screened out and had his appeal rejected. It has done so in more than 100 cases. 
The United States abides by the same criteria, as the boat people in Hong Kong have been told by United States officials visiting them - counseling that is vital because nearly all the boat people left Vietnam with the expressed hope of going to America.
The Lawyers Committee on Human Rights has chosen to present a highly distorted and misleading picture of how the authorities in Hong Kong are handling this difficult problem. It is nonsense to suggest that the boat people are ''helpless to contest adverse findings.''
The reason so few of Hong Kong's boat people are eligible for refugee status is largely that more than 90 percent are from North Vietnam. Relatively few can show a well-founded fear of persecution.
You call for a one-year grace period so that the United States, Britain and others can come up with a better solution, notwithstanding the agreement reached by the international community at a conference in Geneva last June that all illegal immigrants would have to go home.
In the last year, Hong Kong has had to cope with a flood of boat people. If nothing is done before the next ''sailing season,'' which begins in February, another substantial influx is likely over the next 12 months. A grace period would, therefore, only exacerbate the problem.
There is, finally, no question of sending illegal immigrants home without firm assurances from the Vietnamese Government of proper reintegration.

HEADLINE: Why Hong Kong Is Turning Back Boat People

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your reporting on Vietnamese boat people in Hong Kong, most recently in ''Hong Kong Forcibly Returns 51 Boat People'' (front page, Dec. 12), misrepresents the problem. Having lived in Hong Kong and having volunteered in the Vietnamese detention camps, I share your viewpoint that their situation is pitiable, but the blame for it cannot rest solely, or even mainly, on the shoulders of Hong Kong.
When the British Government of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher proposed making Hong Kong the port of first asylum for Vietnamese boat people, it was proposing a system in which Hong Kong was a clearinghouse for refugee resettlement to Britain, its allies and its European partners. It is the failure of those countries to accept the Vietnamese influx that has caused the backlog of boat people in Hong Kong. 
You note that some 13,000 individuals who have been granted refugee status by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees await resettlement, and it is the 40,000 who were not declared refugees who face repatriation. You fail to explain that this distinction between economic and political refugees is not Hong Kong's but the creation of destination countries, like the United States, which do not accept economic refugees. For those who do not receive refugee status, the system does not work.
For many readers, repatriation will seem cruel in any case, and they may wonder why Hong Kong does not absorb these immigrants. The answer is threefold: (1) the boat people do not want to settle in Hong Kong - they are willing to wait almost endlessly for resettlement, but they see Hong Kong only as a way station; (2) while Hong Kong is wealthy compared with Vietnam, it is crowded and ill equipped to provide social welfare to so large a group, and (3) China, which resumes sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997, has indicated it will not accept the Vietnamese boat people.
Beijing has also indicated that it will use the Army if necessary to quell social disturbance in Hong Kong. Since riots in the camps (which are frequent, as there are groups from both North and South Vietnam) would qualify, the specter of Chinese troops in Hong Kong has added weight to the arguments of those proposing rapid repatriation.
Hong Kong is composed of refugees; more than half of its population derives from the flood of humanity that left China after 1949. Hong Kong residents understand the risks one takes in starting a new life elsewhere. But they too face an undesired repatriation, in 1997, and must prepare for it as best they can. The decision to repatriate the Vietnamese refugees was not made lightly, but only after years of feeding them, keeping them and hoping that destination countries would accept them. Given our own failure, can we blame Hong Kong?

HEADLINE: Deregulation Created Our Thrifts Crisis

 BODY:
To the Editor:
For many years, the thrift industry enjoyed the protection of Regulation Q, which controlled the maximum interest to be paid to depositors. The thrifts could then write fixed-rate mortgages at interest rates that provided a modest ''spread'' over deposit cost. Thus, the traditional commitment of the thrifts to provide housing finance was made more secure. 
All went well until the rise of money market funds and other unregulated competition for the depositor's dollar. This was accompanied by an outcry from elderly depositors, organized under the title Gray Panthers, lobbying for abolition of Regulation Q. When the Government began to respond, by slowly dismantling deposit rate regulation, many thrifts could see the handwriting on the wall. If they continued raising deposit rates to meet unregulated competition, they could not survive on the meager returns from fixed-rate mortgages entered into 5, 10 or even 20 years earlier.
The thrifts approached Washington proposing that the Federal Government take over some low-rate mortgages at par, for a limited adjustment period, to give time for the thrifts to alter their asset mix. Thereafter, say in five years, the thrifts would repurchase the mortgages at par. Meanwhile, the portfolios would have been diminished by amortization, somewhat reducing the problem.
This helpful, but by no means perfect, palliative was rejected as too costly. It might have been less costly than the expenses facing us now.
Instead, the Government, aided by action of state legislators, began dismantling the asset controls and usury limitations that had hampered thrifts from asset reallocation. The barriers to conversion of mutuals into stock companies also began to come down, which made it easier for high rollers to crowd into the thrift industry. Thus the door was opened to speculation, negligence and, in a few cases, outright criminality.
It's a pity that the foresight of reputable thrift leaders did not receive encouragement from the regulators and legislators. All of us must now pay the price.

HEADLINE: Metal Detectors Make Schools Like Prisons

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Sandra Feldman, head of the United Federation of Teachers, advocates use of metal detectors in each school that requests them (news article, Dec. 7). I'd like to point to some possible limitations and unintended consequences of the security system Ms. Feldman advocates. 
In the school at which I work, since the installation of the system, fights, disruptions and, especially, assaults on teachers are up - with no corresponding increase in overall safety. More important, a jailhouse atmosphere inappropriate to an educational setting has resulted, relegating teaching and learning to a secondary status at best.
Three of the deaths Ms. Feldman refers to took place outside of schools and were caused by offenders the security forces would not have been able to search. The fourth death, of Alexander Stephens at Alfred E. Smith High School on Nov. 13, could better have been prevented had undercover officers been present. Undercover officers would be less disruptive of school routine, more economical and more reflective of a humane concern for the majority of the students.
A student intent on serious crime is not dissuaded by a security force whose appearances are telegraphed by a truck parked on or near school grounds.

HEADLINE: IN THE NATION;
Gorbachev At Bay

BYLINE: By Tom Wicker

 BODY:
The revolt of the Lithuanian Communist Party has brought Mikhail Gorbachev face to face with the most threatening consequence of his reform policies. If nothing is done, he told the party Central Committee in Moscow, ''we will deliberately be heading toward the disintegration of the Soviet Union.''
Yet, what can he do? And from the West's point of view, would that disintegration be undesirable?
Mr. Gorbachev's planned trip to Lithuania clearly is an exploratory measure, in which he hopes to find some way out of the crisis caused by the Lithuanian party's declaration of independence from the Soviet Communist Party. Lithuanian party leaders also have explicitly declared that their goal is an independent Lithuanian republic. 
That goal takes on added force from Moscow's previous admission that its absorption of the Baltic States, including Lithuania, during World War II was ''illegal.'' No one doubts, moreover, that the Lithuanian people, not just a few political leaders, support the idea of independence.
After permitting limited steps toward democracy within the Soviet Union itself, after permitting the nations of Eastern Europe to renounce their externally imposed Communist governments and move toward self-determination, and after condemning efforts to repress this movement in Czechoslovakia and Rumania, Mr. Gorbachev would have to reverse himself totally, as well as his reform program, if he were to smash the Lithuanian independence movement by force.
To do so, first of all, might involve much bloodshed - witness the toll of Rumanians sacrificed to Nicolae Ceausescu's effort to cling to power. Armed repression in Lithuania also would cost Mr. Gorbachev most of the credibility he has in the West as a genuine reformer intent on undoing some of the worst aspects of the cold war years; that would be costly to his reform plans for the Soviet Union, which are highly dependent on Western cooperation. And though repression might manage the problem temporarily it could not solve it permanently - in Lithuania or in other restive Soviet republics.
On the other hand, if Mr. Gorbachev takes no effective steps to mollify the Lithuanians - if any such steps are possible - it can hardly be doubted that they will proceed toward independence. That, in turn, surely would set off similar independence movements in the other Baltic States, Latvia and Estonia, perhaps also in other dissident Soviet republics -leading, Mr. Gorbachev warned, ''to the disintegration of the Soviet Union.'' Latvia seems already to be following Lithuania's course.
Some bitterly anti-Soviet Americans undoubtedly would celebrate such disintegration - the final victory of the capitalist West over ''the evil empire'' with which the U.S. and its allies have been engaged in cold war for nearly a half-century; the downfall of what they regard as the most oppressive of the world's states.
The disintegration of any great nation, however, is not so simple a matter as its disappearance. Soviet leaders, from Mr. Gorbachev down, can hardly be expected to acquiesce in any development so cataclysmic to them or to their heritage and culture; in fact, their permissive course in Eastern Europe was a recognition of necessity and reflected their desire to preserve their own regime rather than imperil it in a vain attempt to impose their will on surrounding states.
Who knows what forces, in a disintegrating nation, might seize power, or to what methods they might resort in trying to redeem the situation? Even a truncated Soviet Union, so threatened and so led, and with a mighty nuclear arsenal, could prove a far more serious threat to peace than any Soviet regime so far. A threatened and crumbling Soviet Union also could become a more malignant oppressor of its own peoples. And what effect on stability in Eastern Europe, and elsewhere around the rim of the present Soviet Union, might there be from the emergence of a handful of new nations eager to recoup the lost years of captivity?
If the U.S., despite its actions in Central America, stands for the self-determination of peoples, it can hardly oppose the ultimate independence of Lithuania and other captive Soviet republics. There may be better and safer ways to realize that independence, however, and better ways for the U.S. to support it, than through the ''disintegration'' of the Soviet Union. A sound Soviet economy, leading to a stable Soviet political regime, promises more to the West - and perhaps even to Lithuania - than a disintegrating nation desperately trying to salvage itself.

Someone to Call When Jobs End And Pain Grows

BYLINE: By WAYNE KING

DATELINE: LAKEWOOD, N.J.

 BODY:
rrFifty-seven-year-old George Jagger had worked at the Excel Wood Products Company here for 11 years before he was laid off last April.
He had suffered several disabilities, serious back problems and mysterious fractures that seemed to have little or no cause. Before the layoff, the Teamsters union medical plan at the plant paid most of his medical bills, ''well into the thousands,'' but since then, the union contract expired and the union ''just walked away'' the workers say.
All but about 40 of the 400 employees have been laid off. The plant owner informed them last February that the plant would ultimately be closed. It was about that time that Mr. Jagger learned he had osteoporosis, a disease that causes bone degeneration, and that caused his fractures. He still managed to get two other jobs, in a ceramics factory and as an electrician's helper, but his back collapsed again and he had to quit. 
It has been tough, but with the support of his co-workers and a self-help group called the Worker Resource Center, he is ready to try again. He is participating in a federally financed rehabilitation program that includes physical therapy and job retraining that will enable him to take on employment that will not threaten his disabled back.
''I've been looking for work that wouldn't affect my back,'' Mr. Jagger said. ''I didn't know about the vocation rehab. If I had known, I would have looked into it a year ago.''
The training was arranged through the Worker Resource Center, a three-year-old private nonprofit group that is trying to fill the vacuum that invades worker's lives when their jobs disappear. It is just when workers need help the most - when their jobs are gone -that little help is available.
''Unions represent people when they have jobs,'' said Stanley Fischer, who was president of the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers local at a 3M plant in Freehold that laid off 360 workers when it closed in 1985. ''After the closure, the workers really didn't have anybody to represent them,'' said Mr. Fischer, 39, who had worked at the plant for 19 years and made $10 an hour as a machine operator.
Mr. Fischer's union - down to 90,000 members from nearly twice that 15 years ago - sent in a transition team, but could do little in the long term. Several of the laid-off workers talked of suicide. Alcoholism and stress-related illness increased, family quarrels erupted and child abuse went up.
With a $25,000 donation from Bruce Springsteen, whose song ''My Hometown'' about growing up in Freehold amid industrial collapse became a blue-collar anthem, Mr. Fischer formed a group called Hometowns Against Shutdowns that also enlisted Willie Nelson, Ed Asner and a score of other celebrities.
But he soon realized it was a losing battle -plant shutdowns in America are dictated by the incontrovertible bottom line - and the Worker Resource Center evolved, as he puts it ''to deal with the carnage.''
Since then there have been a dozen other shutdowns displacing more than 3,000 workers in Ocean and Monmouth counties alone - 600 at CIBA-Geigy Chemical in Toms River, 550 at Charles of the Ritz in Holmdel, among the bigger ones - and the center is trying to pick up the pieces.
At Holmdel a laid-off mother of three developed hysterical breathing problems, withdrew to her home and began keeping the children home from school to be with her. Here in Lakewood a diabetic in his 50's could no longer afford insulin. The center arranged counseling for the woman and arranged for a pharmaceutical company to donate the insulin for the diabetic. There are 75 outstanding medical claims totaling more than $40,000 and neither the company nor the union is willing to pay them.
But for the most part, the center relies on peer counseling: laid-off workers meet from once a week to once a month, as they do in a church here, to talk about their problems. Here, they are mostly Hispanic, and a number do not speak English.
Leon C., 72, a Colombian without papers, made $4 an hour as a cleaning man and assembly line helper, but was asked by his family to leave home after he lost his job because he could no longer pay his way.
Rafael Gonzales speaks no English, and his Spanish is mangled by a severe speech impediment. The center is trying to find a way, without insulting him, to introduce the idea of speech therapy. Tuesday was his 51st birthday, and about a dozen other laid-off workers sang ''Happy Birthday'' at a supper after the meeting. Mr. Gonzales and several others took extra plates home with them.

HEADLINE: Court Rules on Assessment Of Subsidized Units in Jersey

BYLINE: By GEORGE JAMES

 BODY:
A New Jersey appeals court has ruled that subsidized housing should be assessed for tax purposes on its actual purchase price, rather than on its higher market value.
A three-judge panel of the Appellate Division of Superior Court on Wednesday reversed a 1988 State Tax Court ruling that allowed Ridgefield Park to assess condominiums bought under the state's affordable-housing guidelines without regard for restrictions on their resale intended to preserve their lower prices.
For advocates of affordable housing, the decision affirmed New Jersey's commitment to building affordable housing. But others, including the New Jersey State League of Municipalities, see the ruling as eroding the tax base of many communities. 
There are about 3,000 to 4,000 units built under the state's affordable-housing guidelines, with another 13,000 to 20,000 planned or under construction.

Deed restrictions, in order to assure a unit's affordability, limit resale value to the initial purchase price plus consumer price index increases. In the decision, Judge Sylvia B. Pressler, wrote that such restrictions must be considered by assessors in fixing assessments.
The deed restriction, she wrote, is ''a restriction whose burden on the owner is clearly designed to secure a public benefit of overriding social and economic importance, namely the maintenance of this state's woefully inadequate inventory of affordable housing.''
Kathleen Dunleavy, one of two homeowners who had appealed the assessments, said she was ''thrilled, because, aside from expecting a tax refund, ''to tell you the truth, I think a lot of people will benefit from this decision.''
Mrs. Dunleavy, a 31-year old divorced mother of a 10-year old boy, had been paying about $2,000 in taxes based on full market value as opposed to $1,000 she would have paid under the deed restriction on a condominium bought in 1981 for $40,000.
 
Decision to Be Appealed
Martin T. Durkin, the lawyer for Ridgefield Park, said he had conferred with the Mayor and Commissioners and would appeal the decision.
''They were somewhat disappointed because there's a lot of tax exempt property in Ridgefield Park,'' Mr. Durkin said. When the village meets a goal of about 120 units of affordable housing, it stands to lose about $120,000 in taxes because of the decision, he said.
In 1975 and 1983 rulings, the New Jersey Supreme Court required the state's 567 communities to include in their zoning plans housing for low- and moderate-income people. The rulings stemmed from a zoning case in Mount Laurel near Philadelphia.
Sidna Mitchell, a spokeswoman for the state Council on Affordable Housing, said, ''We're delighted because obviously the effect of this decision will be to continue to insure the affordability of the units.''
Under the Mount Laurel formula, after a 10 percent down payment for a unit has been made, the monthly principal, interest, insurance, condominium fees and taxes cannot exceed 28 percent of a family's gross monthly income.
Brian Campion, a Paramus lawyer who represented Mrs. Dunleavy and another resident, Wayne Prowitz, said assessments on full market value would have required developers to absorb the cost of the increased taxes and discouraged the building of affordable housing.
But Jim Moran, legislative analyst for the New Jersey State League of Municipalities said the decision would cause the ''tax burden to fall more heavily on other homeowners'' in many communities, including the elderly.''

THE ECONOMY
 
Federal regulators and banking experts are concerned that mounting losses from troubled real estate loans could lead to a wave of bank failures, straining the Federal insurance program that protects depositors' funds. The danger, regulators and analysts say, is that when the country enters an economic downturn, as most economists say it eventually must, the losses at commercial banks may be so large that the Government might have to raise insurance fees on the banking industry or rescue some banks with taxpayers' money.

HEADLINE: American Express to Sell Geneva Bank for $1 Billion

BYLINE: By KURT EICHENWALD

 BODY:
The American Express Company has reached an agreement to sell its Geneva-based private banking subsidiary to another Swiss banking institution for about $1 billion, American Express said yesterday.
The unit, the TDB American Express Bank, serves only wealthy clients and has assets of about $12 billion. The assets will be assumed by the Compagnie de Banque et d'Investissements of Geneva, or CBI, a leading private banking and asset-management institution in Switzerland.
Under the terms of the deal, a new bank, to be known as the TDB-CBI Bank, will be created through a combination of the institutions. CBI will own 80 percent of the new bank, with American Express owning 20 percent. 
The new bank will be headed by Edgar de Picciotto, CBI's managing director and primary shareholder.
Executives with American Express said yesterday that deposits at TDB American Express would be transferred to the new institution and that CBI would undertake a marketing effort to persuade American Express Bank's clients to invest their deposits with CBI's asset-management activities. Those activities will operate out of the combined bank.
The sale of TDB American Express ends a six-year effort by American Express to break into the clubby world of international banking in Switzerland, and signals that its original hope to become a comprehensive international financial institution did not succeed.
Indeed, while American Express will be selling the subsidiary for more than what it paid for it, the company executives said that changes within the structure of the bank, along with inflation, would mean that the New York-based company would make only a small profit on the sale.
The American Express executives said the agreement to sell the Geneva operation stemmed from a decision last summer to abandon those businesses that it could not dominate.
 
'Critical and Core' Focus
''Because we have so many businesses, we knew we needed to focus on those criticial and core to us,'' said G. Richard Thoman, the president and chief executive of the American Express International Corporation, the unit of the American Express Company that oversees its banking operations. ''The first thing that we decided was that we had to stick to those businesses where we could be the leader.''
Mr. Thoman said that the money from the deal would be used to build up the company's other international financial specialties, including charge-card and other travel-related services.
Negotiations with CBI began about six weeks ago. But European executives outside the company who were familiar with the situation said yesterday that American Express had approached CBI for the second time in three years.
The sale does not affect the American Express Bank Ltd., which has 86 locations in 39 countries. Unlike the Swiss banking operations of TDB American Express, which attracts the wealthiest of clients, these banks serve a broader range of wealthy clients and their businesses.
The company said it expected its American Express Bank Ltd. unit to continue operating in Switzerland through a license to serve its global clients.
 
Flagship Operation
But TDB American Express had been the flagship of the company's international banking effort. American Express bought the bank's core operation, the Trade Development Bank, from Edmond J. Safra, who founded the institution in the 1950's and has developed a reputation for being one of Geneva's leading bankers. The operations were sold to American Express in 1983 for $520 million, with the understanding that Mr. Safra would continue to direct the banking operations.
But Mr. Safra left American Express within two years amid rumors that strains had developed between him and the company's top management in New York. Mr. Safra was allowed to buy back portions of the Trade Development Bank as part of a separation agreement, and they formed the nucleus of the banks he now runs, Safra Republic Holdings S.A. and the Republic New York Corporation, the parent company of the Republic National Bank of New York.
Like TDB American Express, Mr. Safra's operations cater to wealthy clients.
 
Disinformation Effort
The resulting competition between Mr. Safra's banking operations and TDB American Express led to one of the more unusual events in American Express's history. In August, the company apologized to Mr. Safra for conducting a disinformation campaign that led to defamatory news articles about him. The articles, some of which had been found libelous by foreign courts, linked Mr. Safra and the banks he controlled to drug trafficking, organized crime and the Iran-contra affair.
In settling the matter, American Express agreed to pay $8 million to four charities. Executives with the company have said that the campaign resulted from overzealous executives competing with Mr. Safra.
The American Express executives said yesterday that the sale of TDB American Express was not related to last August's events. They declined to say whether they had approached Mr. Safra about selling him the Geneva operation, although they said they had been approached by interested parties whom they declined to name.

Reality's the Thing This Field Needs

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

DATELINE: ATLANTA

 BODY:
FOR the thousands of economists attending the annual meetings here of the American Economic Association, and for the millions of people in the world undergoing rapid and often chaotic change, there is a crucial question: How good is the state of economics?
The answer from some leaders of the profession: Not so good. Herbert A. Simon of Carnegie-Mellon University, a winner of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science, contends that the differences and sharp conflicts among economists demonstrate that the state of economic knowledge is insecure.
''The public is not mistaken in its perception that economists disagree frequently and vociferously,'' Mr. Simon said. ''We have Keynesian economics, monetarism, supply-side economics, rational expectations and budget balancing, not to mention free trade, protection for infant industries, and proponents of the income tax, the single tax, the sales tax and almost no taxes at all.'' 
Michael J. Boskin, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, sought to resolve these clashes by taking what he called a ''pragmatic, eclectic'' position. He said the public could not expect to find a ''pure monetarist, pure Keynesian or pure rational expectationist'' on his staff. ''We are not sticking slavishly to any one of them,'' he said, adding, ''This view is shared by most people in the Administration and fits in with the way President Bush thinks.'' He counseled much greater humility for economists.
Despite differences among economists on both analyses and policies, some critics insist that economists share a common and incorrect approach to understanding human behavior - that they exaggerate human rationality, alleging that people act on the basis of calculations and forecasts of how they can get the most income, profits or well-being.
Kenneth J. Arrow of Stanford University, who won the Nobel Memorial Prize in 1972, observed in an essay in a new book, ''The State of Economic Science,'' that ''the impossibility of carrying out such calculations is manifest from everyday observation and confirmed by the inability of economists using our theory and our computing power to make good forecasts - even good contingent forecasts.'' A contingent forecast is one based on certain assumptions.
Mr. Arrow noted that in experiments, cognitive psychologists had found systematic kinds of bias in human behavior, strongly contradicting the economists' assumption of rational behavior. Both Mr. Arrow and Mr. Simon urged the economists to learn from these psychological studies.
The inability of economists to forecast reliably remains a persistent criticism of the profession. There is increasing question, after the development of chaos theory in mathematics, about whether economic systems, given their complexity and the possibility that small changes in some variables will produce enormous changes in the overall system, is inherently chaotic and does not lend itself to dependable forecasts.
Even some of the most mathematical economists now complain that the field has become overly wedded to abstract theories and too careless and casual in amassing the empirical data on which understanding must be based.
While noting that no serious economist opposes applying mathematical techniques to economics, Henry Woo of the Hong Kong Institute of Economic Science said, ''What causes concern over present-day economics is the dominance of mathematics almost to the exclusion of other methods of inquiry and the imposition of a mathematical finality on the subject.''
Despite this bill of indictment, economists remain a cocky and feisty group. Because they are consulted routinely by public, press and Presidents, they believe, perhaps correctly, that they are the only wheel in town. Economics is certainly too important to be left to non-economists, with their own heavy political or personal interests.
But there is more to be said in behalf of the best of the profession. They have over the years developed concepts of the interdependence of elements within a system that are not obvious to lay people looking at one event at a time. They have tackled problems, increasingly interesting to other sciences, of decision-making in the face of uncertainty. And they have sometimes shown an imagination and inventiveness in problem-solving that society urgently needs.
The danger is that economists, with their infatuation with abstruse theory, neglect the hard empirical work on which public policies must depend.
In brief, as some outstanding economists see it, the field needs to be both richer in its intellectual and empirical content and more of a science in the true sense. As Mr. Simon put it: ''What distinguishes science from every other form of human intellectual activity is that it disciplines speculation with facts. Theory and data are the two blades of the scissors. But the metaphor is not quite right, for the blades are not symmetrical. When theories and facts are in conflict, the theories must yield. Economics has strayed from that simple principle, and it must return to it.''
One way of getting there is for more economists of this generation to get as involved in economic problem-solving as their predecessors during the Depression, World War II and the Marshall Plan.

HEADLINE: Slower Growth Is Seen For U.S. Manufacturers

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 28

 BODY:
American industry should enjoy an eighth straight year of expansion in 1990, but the gains among manufacturers, at 2 percent, will be lower than this year's 2.2 percent, the Commerce Department said today.
High-technology and health-related industries are expected to post the biggest increases in growth, with the auto makers and construction prominent among the laggards.
''Over all, in 1990 we see continued but slower growth for the vast majority of industries, both manufacturing and services,'' said J. Michael Farren, Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade. ''This is consistent with the expected overall performance of the United States economy.'' 
 
Based on G.N.P. Assumptions
Mr. Farren briefed reporters as the department published summaries of ''U.S. Industrial Outlook,'' its annual survey of the prospects for more than 350 manufacturing and service industries.
The survey was based on the Bush Administration's mid-1989 assumption that gross national product would rise by 2.3 percent next year. But if a recession occurs, the department's expectations will not be met, one official ackowledged.
Although officials cautioned that the survey did not constitute a forecast for the entire economy, the Outlook's broad scope excludes only government, utilities and wholesaling among the major sectors.
One of the more noteworthy items disclosed by the publication is that receipts from foreign visitors to the United States this year will for the first time exceed spending by Americans traveling abroad. With total expenditures for travel services expected to rise nearly 7 percent in 1990, the United States will run a trade surplus of more than $1 billion in this area, the department said.
 
Growth in Chemical Exports
Another positive sign involved exports, which have shown little growth in recent months.
The chemical industry, which by some measures is the nation's biggest industrial exporter, is expected to post ''moderate'' growth, with its exports rising above $38 billion. ''This industry is at the focal point of a 'new material' renaissance,'' Mr. Farren said. The industry has been shifting its focus to high-value-added speciality products from inexpensive bulk chemicals.
Aerospace, probably the No. 2 exporter, will show a 3.5 percent increase in constant-dollar shipments despite a decline in military sales, the department predicted. More than 500 large commercial jets are to be delivered next year, more than three times the number in 1984.
Other strong industries are projected to be medical equipment and measuring and control devices. The paper industry is expected to show ''steady growth'' and sales of wood products, while slow domestically, are expected to rise abroad.
 
'A Lot of Export Strength'
''There's still a lot of export strength out there,'' said Jonathan C. Menes, director of the Office of Industry Assessment.
Of the 193 manufacturing industries in the survey, 150 of them are expected to grow, officials said.
The manufacturers and the service industries covered in the Outlook are measured by revenues, receipts, expenditures, manufacturing value or other benchmarks and cannot be directly compared.
On the negative side, the auto makers in 1990 will suffer another year of falling sales, the department said, although the decline should be less than 100,000 vehicles units, far less than this year's drop of 600,000 vehicles. Analysts saw little change in the overall market share for imported vehicles, but they expect the Japanese to continue to take market share from European luxury cars.
Construction activity was projected to be about the same in constant dollars, with housing starts probably flat after a drop of 90,000 this year. The value of residential construction, however, should rise because of an increase in home improvements and a greater proportion of larger new homes.
 
Services Lead the Way
Service industries are again expected to outperform manufacturing industries, the department said, but it provided no aggregate growth rate. Business and information services will lead the way. In the first half of 1989, business services generated a trade surplus five times the rate of 1985.
The 500-page Outlook, prepared by 130 industry analysts supported by economists and statisticians, is to be available at the end of January for $27 through the United States Government Printing Office and at its 23 regional bookstores.

HEADLINE: Eastern Plans Wage Cuts, 600 Layoffs

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS

 BODY:
Eastern Airlines said yesterday that it was laying off 600 employees, mostly managers, and cutting wages by 10 percent or 20 percent for about half its work force.
Thomas J. Matthews, Eastern's senior vice president of human resources, estimated that the measures would save the carrier about $100 million a year. He said at a news conference in Miami that the steps had been taken because of Eastern's sale of the airline's Latin American routes to American Airlines for $471 million and because of a decision to downsize. 
The carrier disclosed last week that it would scale back its operations to two-thirds its size before a crippling strike began on March 4 and said that some ''furloughs'' would result.
 
Back to Earlier Plan
Several months ago, Eastern, buoyed by its ability to rebuild faster than expected under the protection of the Federal bankruptcy court, said it was planning to rebuild to about 80 percent of the size it had maintained before the strike by machinists' union began. The carrier's pilots and flight attendants walked out in sympathy, but called off their actions before Thanksgiving.
But last Friday, Eastern said it had decided to go back to its original, more modest plan. Mr. Matthews said yesterday that the decision had resulted from low traffic, stiff competition in Miami from such carriers as Pan Am and an uncertain economic outlook for next year.
He said Eastern planned to file its reorganization plan soon with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York.
Eastern sought bankruptcy protection five days after the strike began last March, and, with the approval of the court, has sold more than $1.5 billion in assets to keep operating and to reorganize.
Judge Burton R. Lifland, the chief judge of the court, has supported Eastern management's attempt to rebuild the carrier, which has most of its routes on the East Coast.
The 10 percent wage cuts will affect the more senior employees, not the new and recently hired workers who receive much lower wages. The 20 percent cut will affect senior management.
 
Some Not Affected
Mr. Matthews said the job cutbacks, totaling about 3 percent of its employees, would not affect pilots, mechanics or flight attendants, who make up most of Eastern's work force of 20,000. He added that the current layoffs would be the last for Eastern to put into effect under its reorganization plan.
Many of the reductions will be made in the Miami area, where Eastern is based and where flights will be cut to 50, from 75, by Jan. 31. Other reductions will be made when American takes over the Latin American routes on July 1.
The Pan Am Corporation said yesterday that it would object to the route sale to American, which must be approved by the Justice Deprtment, the Transportation Department and the bankruptcy court.
Eastern plans to rebuild by making Atlanta its primary hub and expects to operate about 75 percent of its flights from there.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
An Emblem Is Renewed For Merrill

BYLINE: By Randall Rothenberg

 BODY:
AMERICA can rest on this last weekend of the 1980's secure in the knowledge that ''Merrill Lynch is bullish on the 90's.''
On Sunday, the brokerage house that took the bull out of the pasture and thrust him into Wall Street nearly two decades ago (where the menagerie also included the Dreyfus lion) will premiere the latest stage in the evolution of its lasting advertising concept.
Actually, the new broadcast campaign, which will saturate televised sports events on Sunday and Monday, is the confluence of two themes that Merrill Lynch has been developing through its advertising agency since 1986, Bozell. While extolling the risk-taking investor symbolized by the bull, the commercials close with the slogan the company introduced last year, ''A tradition of trust.'' 
The underpinning of the campaign was revealed in a handwritten statement written and read by Bozell's chief executive, Charles D. (Chuck) Peebler Jr., in an early-morning interview two days after Christmas.
Mr. Peebler went on for many minutes about how ''Merrill Lynch believes in the American spirit,'' which he said was exemplified by the country's 138 million telephones, $25 billion in annual charitable giving, 47 electrical appliances in the average American home and mere 18 minutes it takes the average American to earn enough money to purchase a pound of hamburger. ''Sometimes,'' Mr. Peebler said, ''the positives don't get accentuated the way they should.''
Fortunately, such dryly statistical positives are not accentuated in Bozell's new ads for Merrill Lynch. Instead, the commercials are a showcase for the creative reformation that Jay Schulberg promised to instigate when he left Ogilvy & Mather last year and became creative director of Bozell, New York.
The three dramatic spots are visually surprising panoramas that use much of the technical trickery familiar from the plethora of MTV-influenced ads on the air. But they use the technology in soft and inspiring, rather than harsh and jarring, ways.
''We wanted to be future-oriented without looking too high tech,'' said Paul Critchlow, Merrill Lynch's director of corporate communications.
In ''Skies,'' for example, a bull marches silently across a plain, while in the sky above him a century's worth of images glide by, from biplanes and doughboys to Iwo Jima and Yalta to Solidarity and the space shuttle.
''The point of that commercial is the role Merrill plays in understanding and interpreting events for its customers,'' said Charles Mangano, the company's director of corporate advertising.
Interestingly, the other two commercials, ''Bullseye'' and ''Glass Hallway,'' also use sky imagery.
In the first, which addresses the importance of family savings to America's economic competitiveness, the camera pulls back from a simple slice of life - a mother sending her child off to school - to present the scene in an ever-wider context, showing in turns aerial views of their block, neighborhood, town, state, nation and planet. In the end the globe turns out to be a reflection in a bull's eye.
''Glass Hallway'' opens on an office corridor, transparent except for an endless series of doors, and suspended in midair. As the announcer talks about the future's ''limitless possibilities,'' the camera goes through the doors, skimming through a toxic-waste dump and an old-age home, then to more uplifting scenes of a robotics factory and active senior citizens. Here, the bull is a subtle presence, reflected in the grain of a desk.
''Creatively, the point is to break out of the sameness in the financial services category,'' Mr. Schulberg said. ''Everyone is saying, 'Let us manage your money.' No one until now is saying it in a distinctive way.''

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Security Prices Advance

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities moved higher in very light trading yesterday, as dealers took advantage of a recent fairly steep drop to do some buying.
''We have had a nice little tailspin over the last few days, with yields on some securities rising by as much as 25 basis points,'' one government bond trader said.
''We got roughly a 5-basis-point reversal from those levels during this session, and I think we are poised for a rally once the new year begins. But the key will be what the December employment data show a week from Friday.'' 
The urge to buy was buttressed by a dip in energy prices and a firmer dollar. Despite the importance of the December employment data, traders were unmoved by a weekly report that showed a slight rise in initial unemployment claims.
''On balance, dealers spent the last couple of days closing their books,'' said Raymond W. Stone, a managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates, a firm that provides research and commentary on the credit and foreign exchange markets. ''For the most part, both dealers and investors have just been riding out the last few days of the year.''
 
Collapse of Bond Dealer
Traders said the collapse of Swink & Company, a small Arkansas bond dealer, had little impact in the credit markets.
On Wednesday the company, which is based in Little Rock, said it had permanently closed its doors after sustaining more than $1 million in losses trading government bonds.
''A trading loss of that size is not big enough to cause even a ripple in this market,'' one bond trader said.
By late yesterday, the Treasury's 8 1/8 percent bonds of 2019 were offered at a price of 101 7/8, up 7/32, to yield 7.95 percent.
Among note issues, the 7 7/8 percent 10-year notes were offered in late trading at 99 29/32, up 1/4 of a point, to yield 7.88 percent. And the 7 3/4 percent five-year notes were offered at 99 5/8, up 7/32, to yield 7.82 percent.
 
Short-Term Bill Rates
Short-term Treasury bill rates eased slightly even as the overnight rate for bank loans in the Federal funds market moved sharply higher.
Year-end financing pressures often push the funds rate higher at the end of December, and yesterday's increase came as no surprise.
Yesterday the rate traded in a range of 9 3/4 percent to 9 3/8 percent, more than a full percentage point above the 8.25 percent level that most money market analysts say is the Fed's current target for the funds rate.
Treasury bill traders ignored the increase in the cost of overnight money, and bill rates moved lower.
By late in the day, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 7.67 percent, down a basis point, or hundredth of a point. Six-month bill rates fell by 5 basis points, to a late offered rate of 7.52 percent. One-year bill rates fell by a similar amount, to a late offered rate of 7.22 percent.
Mr. Stone and other analysts said that if anything today's activity is likely to be even more subdued than yesterday's session, as market participants head off for the long New Year's Day holiday weekend.
''Friday should be a real ho-hummer,'' Mr. Stone said.
Elsewhere, participants in the secondary markets for corporate and tax-exempt municipal bonds said that activity was extremely light. Prices of most issues were unchanged on the day.
No new issues of corporate or municipal debt were priced yesterday.
In other developments, the Federal Reserve Board reported yesterday that all three measures of the nation's money supply rose during the week ended Dec. 18. The report had no impact on prices in the credit markets.

HEADLINE: Dow Rises 7.90 Points, To 2,732.30

BYLINE: By PHILLIP H. WIGGINS

 BODY:
Stock prices rose across a broad front yesterday, but the advance was tempered by end-of-the-year selling.
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 7.90 points, to 2,732.30, as advances on the New York Stock Exchange outnumbered declines, 842 to 673. The Dow moved in only about a 13-point range throughout the day. 
Volume on the Big Board contracted to 128 million shares, from 133.7 million on Wednesday.
In the broader market. the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks gained 1.86 points, to 350.67, while the New York Stock Exchange composite index added 0.90, to 193.59.
''The stock market is digesting a change in leadership,'' observed Rao Chalasani, the chief investment strategist at Prescott, Ball & Turben Inc. in Cleveland. ''Money already is moving away from popular stocks, such as some consumer staples and insurance issues, into recently unpopular groups like chemicals, paper, technology and regional banks. This change in leadership seems to be for real.''
 
Champion Jumps to $30.75
He noted, for example, that Champion International, the large building materials and paper products company based in Stamford, Conn., rose 1 3/8, to 30 3/4, in active trading.
Campbell Soup climbed 4 3/8, to 57 3/8, on renewed buyout speculation after a group of Dorrance family members said it wanted to sell its 17.4 percent of the company, based in Camden, N.J. The opening of trading in the stock was delayed because of an imbalance of buy orders, traders said.
Polaroid jumped 3 points, to 44 1/4. An analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities, Alex Henderson, reiterated a strong ''buy'' recomendation on the company, based in Cambridge, Mass., after raising his estimate of the damage award the company would receive from Eastman Kodak in a patent-infringement case to $1.5 billion, from $800 million to $1 billion. Kodak, with headquarters in Rochester, was unchanged at 40 3/4.
For the second day, foreign funds were among the biggest percentage gainers on the Big Board, as they apparently continued to benefit from anticipation of economic change in the Eastern bloc. The Austria Fund rose 2 1/2, to 19 1/2; Spain Fund gained 3, to 31 1/2, and Germany Fund rose 1 3/4, to 19, buoyed by Japanese buying.
Blue chips dominated the most active list, with Philip Morris rising 7/8, to 41 1/8, Chase Manhattan unchanged at 34 3/4 and I.B.M falling 5/8, to 94 1/8.
On the American Stock Exchange, the market-value index gained 0.94, to 373.90, while in over-the-counter trading, the Nasdaq composite added 1.17 points, to 449.98.
In Tokyo, the Nikkei index of 225 issues ended the year at a record 38,876.94, rising 75.31 points, or 0.19 percent.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Is Up Sharply in U.S. After Mixed Day in Europe

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar finished sharply higher in domestic trading yesterday after a mixed performance overseas.
Trading was thin in Europe, where the dollar was buffeted by trading in other currencies. Dealers in Frankfurt said the Bank of England and the central bank of the Netherlands had intervened to curb the strength of the West German mark against their currencies. 
But when dealings shifted to the United States, the dollar moved sharply higher on technical factors, traders said. The dollar's biggest move came against the yen, which was adversely affected by reports of political uncertainty in the face of coming elections.
 
'Thin Market' Noted
The dollar traded in seesaw fashion throughout the session. Its moves were ''accentuated by the thin market,'' said Michael McDonald, a trader at Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago.
''The mark remained the strongest currency in the world,'' he said, noting that interest-rate differentials are tipping in favor of West Germany over the United States. Further bolstering the mark is the assumption that the opening of East Germany will spur a demand for West German products.
In Tokyo, the dollar rose to 142.15 Japanese yen, from 142.10 yen on Wednesday. Later in London, it rose to 143.15 yen. In New York the dollar closed at 143.55 yen, up from 142.00 yen on Wednesday.
In London, the British pound fell to $1.6137, from $1.6255 late Wednesday. In New York it cost $1.6045 to buy 1, cheaper than Wednesday's $1.6275.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Wednesday, included: 1.6875 West German marks, up from 1.6855; 1.5390 Swiss francs, up from 1.5295; 5.7675 French francs, up from 5.7600; 1,264.15 Italian lire, up from 1,263.75, and 1.1568 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1574.
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Wednesday, included: 1.6905 West German marks, up from 1.6895; 1.5385 Swiss francs, up from 1.5355; 5.7665 French francs, down from 5.7760; 1.9000 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9080; 1,264.50 Italian lire, down from 1,266.00, and 1.1563 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1587.

HEADLINE: Explosive Drug Use Creating New Underworld Prisons

SERIES: Drugs and the Law
Last of three articles:
Addiction Behind Bars

BYLINE: By ANDREW H. MALCOLM

 BODY:
Drug use inside prisons across the United States has become a major problem with a variety of consequences, including threats to prison order, violence among inmates and corruption of guards and other employees.
After years of denying or overlooking the existence of illicit drugs behind the towering walls and ribbons of razor wire that encircle their institutions, prison administrators, as well as academics, have only just begun to study the precise scale of inmate drug abuse.
But a series of interviews, visits to prisons and reviews of the professional literature in recent weeks indicate the problem is more widely acknowledged. Controversial steps are already being taken to combat the surprising ingenuity of prison drug smugglers. And many prison officials express resignation that the problem will never be solved without Draconian measures that American society seems unwilling to impose. 
''There's been a real explosion of drug use in prison,'' said Dr. Harry Wexler of Narcotics and Drug Research Inc., a nonprofit company that does considerable research with Federal grants. ''The explanation is simple: There's been a real explosion of drug users going to prison.'' William Flower, a spokesman for the Connecticut Department of Correction, added, ''What you have on the street is what you have on the inside.''
More than three dozen states are operating under some kind of court order controlling overcrowding, and tough enforcement of drug laws has worsened that problem as more men and women have been convicted of drug violations. Estimates of the prisoners personally involved with drugs now range from 40 to 90 percent.
Thousands of new cells are planned or under construction, costing billions of dollars. President Bush's new anti-drug program contains an 85 percent increase in Federal money for prison construction.
Never in the nation's history have so many of its citizens been imprisoned. As of June 30, state and Federal prisons contained 673,565 prisoners. That was an increase of 7.3 percent, or 56,004 prisoners just since January, a larger increase in six months than the nation has ever experienced in a whole year.
Formal drug rehabilitation treatment within prisons is just in its infancy, and many of those facing long sentences for drug offenses like trafficking were drug abusers themselves.
Often during their daytime rounds of noisy prison common rooms, guards detect the familiar glazed look of an addict intoxicated on drugs. They tell of coming upon inmates shooting up in the private shadows of their cells, and at night, the guards say, they routinely smell marijuana smoke drifting out from the darkness behind the bars. Inmates, too, tell of witnessing frequent drug use.
''I've seen more drugs in here than out there,'' said Charles Capers, a 37-year-old, six-time convict in the Connecticut penal system.
Sharon A. Williams of the National Criminal Justice Reference Service, said, ''The prison drug problem is beginning to emerge now,'' adding, ''You couldn't talk about it before.''
Not every prison system admits to a major problem. Greg Bogdan, a spokesman for the Federal Bureau of Prisons, whose institutions hold about 7 percent of the nation's prisoners, said 49,936 random urine tests of Federal prisoners in the nine months ending last June 30 found only 2.2 percent testing positive, half the 1986 rate.
It is generally in the far larger state and county prison systems that the problem is detected and now openly discussed.
''Prisons are an incredible captive drug market,'' said Bob B., a former New York prison counselor and onetime heroin addict who asked that his full name not be used. ''Drugs inside can bring three times their street value.'' He told of counseling prisoners fearful for their lives because they were caught in wars among inmates competing for control of drug sales. He himself admitted smuggling in some drugs on occasion.
Indeed, announcements of arrests of prison staff for drug smuggling have become frequent. In Michigan, some prison personnel were charged with accepting bribes to arrange for some inmates to transfer from one institution to another to expand the prison drug rings.
 
The Smugglers
 
Liberalized Visiting,
Ingenious Conduits
Though prison staff involvement in drug smuggling and sales is a serious problem, the principal transporters of drugs into prisons, the officials say, are visitors. And the increasingly large numbers of visitors make thorough individual searches unrealistic, if not impossible, given current liberalized visiting policies and procedures. Drug deliveries by visitors and payments to drug suppliers are easily arranged from inside by unmonitored pay phones, the officials said.
The drugs arrive in prison in many imaginative manners - squeezed into the bindings of books, hidden on the back of stamps, inside a girlfriend's bra or a baby's diapers and stuffed into rectums or vaginas.
Searches are often prohibited by courts unless there is good reason for suspicion. To establish such probable cause, all visitors to New York City's Rikers Island prisons, for instance, are assigned numbered seats on special buses. After a short ride, visitors are removed from the bus while trained drug-sniffing dogs check each seat. When the dogs, with names like Curley, Melvin, Major and Roscoe, indicate strong interest in a particular seat, the occupant is required to undergo a thorough body search or his or her visit is canceled.
 
Thick Glass Is Gone
The scale of the problem in checking visitors is evident in the crowded New York City jail system. It has 20,300 prisoners in its 15 institutions, 2,810 more than last December. It has 12,293 employees, including 10,210 correction officers, or guards. Each year the system must also process nearly 400,000 visitors, or several visitors for each prisoner.
And while visitors are screened by metal detectors and a handful of guards monitor the visiting rooms, security is nothing like the popular image from old movies, with prisoners and families separated by thick glass and conversing by telephone.
In the last decade or so, prison philosophy has emphasized helping prisoners maintain family ties as an integral part of their long-range rehabilitation. So most institutions now allow what are called ''contact visits.'' Typically, dozens of prisoners sit across open tables from visitors, holding hands. Embraces and kisses are allowed at the beginning and end of the visit.
One popular means of transmitting drugs is to exchange a balloon packed with drugs during a kiss. Some prisons videotape visiting rooms, and guards replay tapes of the initial embraces to spot suspicious kisses. Those prisoners will then undergo a particularly rigorous examination by guards after the visit before being returned to their cell.
Some prisoners have been known to swallow the balloon before such searches and to recover the drugs later either by induced vomiting or retrieving the container from their own excrement in a day or two.
 
'Sit Around and Connive'
Another exchange method is for a visitor to deposit the drugs in a designated prison washroom, which is then very promptly ''cleaned'' by an inmate crew. Still another is for the visitor to flush a bag of drugs down a prison toilet for waiting inmates to fish from the institution's sewage treatment plant.
Michael A. Chernovetz, warden of the Community Correctional Center in Bridgeport, Conn., said most citizens are unaware of how prisons are run today. ''They think every institution is always locked up tighter than a drum,'' he said. ''But the fiscal reality is that I've got to have nonviolent inmates performing many maintenance and caretaker jobs - sweeping driveways, cutting grass, putting out garbage. That inmate earns 75 cents a day. A staff member earns a little more than that. I can't have one staffer stand behind every inmate who goes outside for a few minutes.
''And all it takes is a phone call to a girlfriend to tell her to leave the bag in the third bush from the corner. We even have mothers bringing in the stuff. We try to get as much as possible. But these guys have a lot of time to sit around and connive.''
 
The Impact Inside
 
Corroded Order,
Imported Hostility
Warden Chernovetz and others say the impact of drugs in prison is not so much that prisoners intoxicated by drugs are likely to assault officers, although that has happened. It is more the danger to the institution of importing wholesale into prison the violent, grievance-filled, debt-ridden drug culture of the streets. A more hostile environment results, with the inmates more prone than ever to argue and fight among themselves.
Prison authorities say the underground drug economy creates a generally unsafe environment that corrodes order, reduces the effectiveness of academic and drug treatment programs and can create staff corruption.
''Sometimes,'' said Bob, the former New York prison counselor, ''these inmates were counseling me like an out-mate. They thought I was a fool, coming into prison every day voluntarily for my $23,000 a year and getting high only on the weekends. They arrived in cuffs, were high seven days a week and had a definite date to get out and start making their 100 G's a year dealing drugs.''
''The guards and the bad guys in prison come from the same neighborhoods,'' Bob added. ''The nice guys became guards going to work every day and the nasty guys became occasional inmates. But, you know, if you go to the zoo every day, when you come home, you begin reeking of the zoo.''
 
Problems in Local Jails
The Illinois Department of Corrections reported earlier this year that 66 employees had been arrested in the previous three years on drug and other illegal contraband charges. In one recent six-month period nearly 650 inmates and 100 visitors were involved in such contraband cases.
''We have a bigger problem than society in general,'' the Cook County Sheriff, James O'Grady, said in Chicago after three deputies were among 19 charged last spring in Federal indictments with running a drug ring to supply inmates in the county jail. Two Connecticut guards were arrested for drug smuggling this fall. In Michigan, a Federal-state study group is investigating reports that state corrections officials allowed visitors to smuggle illicit drugs and protected inmates from searches in return for payments of up to $1,000 a week by dealers.
Ruby Ryles of New York City's Department of Correction said that in the last 18 months, 17 department employees had been arrested on prison drug charges. ''Inmates are very creative finding ways of getting drugs in,'' she said. ''But we're creative in finding them, too.''
 
In Search of Solutions
 
Stiff Enforcement
And Interdiction
Phil Seelig, president of the Correction Officers' Benevolent Association, which has 9,000 members in the city penal system, said that guards who had been arrested on drug charges had been enticed to participate and that the ''widespread drug problem'' in city jails resulted from lax security procedures for visitors and failure to properly prosecute prisoners found with drugs.
''We'd also like to see contact visits abandoned and more thorough regular searches of cells,'' he added. As a result of manpower and time constraints, he said, guards can search the accommodations of only about 50 inmates a day out of 2,000 in each unit. ''That doesn't even make a dent,'' he said. ''The drugs just flow into the unsearched area for a while. And those found with drugs should get more time, not just disciplined.''
Wisconsin has stressed enforcement within prison over interdiction. It uses random announced urine tests to discourage drug use, with progressively stiffer disciplinary penalties imposed with each positive test result. Positive test results shrank over three recent years from around 30 percent to the 3 to 6 percent range, with higher rates in the higher security prisons. Officials say this has meant the removal of 1,150 drug users from the prison market in the same period.
 
Rare Searches of Guards
Search procedures vary. Most systems use metal detectors on visitors, and some use them on guards. South Carolina does a pat-down search of all visitors, but other states hesitate without probable cause, fearing lawsuits. Many systems rely on random inmate strip searches after visits.
Guards could be searched but rarely are without a solid tip. ''That would be really awkward, officers searching officers,'' said Mike Van Winkle of California's prison system.
Mr. Chernovetz of the Connecticut system said: ''Sure, some officers are camels. It would be naive to say that some are not drug-involved.''
Many systems are subjecting newly hired officers to rigorous investigation and drug testing. And Florida has begun stiff prosecution of staff members found with drugs. ''Our best deterrent,'' said Bob McMaster of Florida's Department of Corrections, ''is to let our own people see that we're going to be very tough on our own people.''
''Sure,'' said Mr. Flower of Connecticut, ''you could stop all drugs getting into prison. You'd clamp down so hard - no human contact, no visits, no exchanges - it would create an inhuman, explosive situation probably worse than what we've got.''

HEADLINE: AFTER NORIEGA: VATICAN IS BLAMING U.S. FOR IMPASSE ON NORIEGA'S FATE

BYLINE: By ROBERTO SURO

 BODY:
The Vatican blamed the American Government yesterday for the impasse over Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega's fate, calling the United States an ''occupying power'' with no right to demand that the ousted dictator be handed over to its forces.
The chief Vatican spokesman, Joaquin Navarro-Valls, told journalists in Rome yesterday morning that General Noriega was being urged to leave the Vatican's diplomatic mission in Panama City of his own free will.
Mr. Navarro also said that it was up to the Panamanian Government to seek custody of General Noriega if he was to face criminal charges but that so far no such request had come from Panama.
 
Signs of Impatience
Although in its public statements the Vatican continued to characterize contacts with the Bush Administration as friendly, Roman Catholic Church officials began showing signs of impatience with the Administration's insistence that General Noriega must be turned over to American troops, and for the first time American behavior in Panama was publicly criticized yesterday by the Vatican.
The White House reacted to the Vatican statements by insisting that all is well in relations with the church. 
''The Vatican's doing a fine job,'' said Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman. ''We appreciate their efforts. We will continue to work with them in a positive way.''
 
'A Very Difficult Situation'
''It's a very difficult situation, very tense circumstances,'' Mr. Fitzwater continued. ''Our interest is in establishing a harmonious relationship with the Vatican. The Vatican is acting responsibly and cooperatively. We are going to calmly go about pursuing this matter.''
Roman Catholic leaders in the United States have reacted with indignation to criticism of the Vatican. John Cardinal O'Connor of New York said on Thursday he had been ''appalled by the attacks against the church and the Holy See.''
When Mr. Navarro, Mr. Fitzwater's counterpart in the Vatican, was asked about the blockade of the Papal Nunciature in Panama City by American troops and their practice of blasting the building with rock music, he said it was ''a very serious matter,'' unacceptable under international law because it interfered with diplomatic activity.
Senior Vatican officials interviewed by telephone yesterday said the apparent effort at psychological warfare was ''ludicrous'' and ''childish.''
Loudspeakers outside the Nunciature have been playing tunes like ''Voodoo Chile,'' ''Nowhere to Run'' and ''Smugglers Blues'' in what appeared to be an effort to irritate General Noriega.
Mr. Fitzwater was asked at his briefing in Corpus Christi, Tex., on Thursday about whether playing loud rock music outside the Papal Nuncio's residence was further fraying already frayed nerves inside the building. He replied, ''It was an attempt to disrupt communications so that we could have some guarantees of the security of our conversations.''
''You may recall during the Moscow summit when we had the morning meetings in the Moscow Embassy and all around, we had music playing of various kinds to disrupt microwaves and so forth,'' he said. ''That's fairly standard practice.''
When asked about the selection of songs, Mr. Fitzwater said he was ''certainly glad to see the American sense of whimsy come forward in this situation.''
The Vatican officials, who asked not to be named, said the bloodshed caused by the American invasion had raised moral and ethical concerns for Pope John Paul II, but they asserted that opinions on the validity of the American operation were not coloring negotiations over General Noriega's status.
The officials did, however, express misgivings about the heated language the Bush Administration has used in demanding custody of General Noriega, questioning whether domestic political concerns were coloring the Administration's diplomatic posture.
''Sometimes it seems that this obsession with Noriega is being used as a screen to cover what is a very serious military operation with very high human costs,'' said an official directly involved in the negotiations over the general, who took refuge in the Papal Nunciature, the Holy See's diplomatic mission, on Dec. 24.
Another official said, ''There is an appearance of some efforts at misinformation in order to keep the pressure on us.'' He referred to articles this week in which American officials indicated that General Noriega was moving money among several European bank accounts from within the Vatican mission.
''The Americans know full well,'' the official said, ''that as one of the conditions for entering the Nunciature, Noriega accepted total isolation, no visitors and no telephone conversations.''
The official added, ''The Americans have said they want to restore constitutional and democratic rule in Panama, but on the first major issue faced by the new Government there, they are stepping in and saying in effect, 'Give Noriega to us because we are in charge here.' I am afraid it is a bit contradictory.''
 
U.S. Demand Is Rejected
In a briefing for journalists yesterday, Mr. Navarro said of the United States role in Panama, ''An occupying power cannot interfere with the work of a diplomatic mission nor demand that a person seeking asylum in that mission be handed over to it.''
''If the person who seeks asylum is considered guilty of common crimes, it is up to the Government of the country to which the diplomatic mission is accredited to ask for him to be handed over,'' Mr. Navarro said, adding that the Vatican was not discussing the Noriega case with any nations other than the United States and Panama.
Both in public statements and interviews, Vatican officials have said that the decision to grant General Noriega temporary refuge had brought an end to the fighting in Panama and that his case could be resolved through commonly accepted diplomatic norms governing asylum cases.
The Vatican diplomats also noted that the United States had itself made use of diplomatic asylum to help resolve civil conflicts aboard. They cited the cases of Ferdinand E. Marcos of the Philippines and Anastasio Somoza Debayle of Nicaragua, two deposed dictators who were given asylum by the United States and were protected from facing charges in their homelands.
 
No 'Moral Judgment' Implied
''General Noriega has not been accorded status as political refugee, and the decision to afford him temporary asylum does not imply a moral judgment about the man in any way,'' Mr. Navarro said.
He recalled that President Guillermo Endara, new head of the Panamanian Government installed by the United States, spent several weeks in the Nunciature in Panama City earlier this year when he was being sought by the Noriega Government.
The Rev. Robert Graham, a Jesuit and author of diplomatic histories for the Vatican Secretariat of State, said: ''Diplomatic asylum is a matter of common practice in Latin America, and it is accepted and acknowledged by all the nations there and by the United States as well. It is a question of Latin American diplomatic norms, not of Vatican policies or procedures. Diplomatic asylum is also very different from granting someone residence in a country as a political refugee. This is simply a device to grant temporary haven while a person's status is negotiated.''
Father Graham noted that deposed government leaders and dissident politicians in Latin America had often taken refuge in embassies. The common practice, he said, is for the embassy to then negotiate with the government in power to arrange either a safe passage out of the country or conditions under which the person would surrender to the government or simple assurances that the person could go free.
 
Clarifications Sought
A Vatican diplomat involved in Noriega negotiations said: ''A major problem is that we do not have much of a government in Panama to deal with. If someone down there could tell us what they want to do with Noriega and why, that would be a big step. If Panama and the United States could tell us that they have agreed on whether or not Noriega would be extradited to Florida, that too would be a big step. But there have to be some clarifications from Panama before we can do much unless he decides he wants to step outside and take his chances with the Americans.''
Mr. Navarro said Msgr. Jose Sebastian Laboa, the Papal Nuncio in Panama, is ''doing his best to convince General Noriega to leave the Papal Nunciature of his own free will, but he can not force General Noriega to leave the embassy.''
On another matter, Mr. Fitzwater said that a ''high-level economic delegation'' would go to Panama on Wednesday to confer with Panamanian officials on their economic needs. The delegation will be headed by Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger and Deputy Secretary of the Treasury John Robson. They will be accompanied by economic experts from several Federal agencies.

HEADLINE: Upheaval in the East: The Ceausescu Tribunal;
Excerpts From Trial Of Rumanian Leader

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 29 -

 BODY:
Nicolae Ceausescu, the executed Rumanian President, and his wife, Elena, were taken before a military tribunal in Bucharest on Dec. 25 and charged with crimes against the country. The charges included complicity in the killings of as many as 60,000 Rumanians during their 24-year rule and plundering the Rumanian Treasury. 
Following are excerpts from the military trial, as broadcast by the Viennese television. The trial was simultaneously translated into German during its broadcast in Austria, and the italicized portions represent the German translator's paraphrase of some of the courtroom testimony.
The English translation was provided by the United States Government's Foreign Broadcast Information Service.
 
NICOLAE CEAUSESCUI only recognize the grand National Assembly. I will only speak in front of it.
 
PROSECUTORIn the same way he refused to hold a dialogue with the people, now he also refuses to speak with us.
He always claimed to act and speak on behalf of the people, to be a beloved son of the people, but he only tyrannized the people all the time. You are faced with charges that you held really sumptuous celebrations on all holidays at your house. The details are known.
These two defendants procured the most luxurious foodstuffs and clothes from abroad. They were even worse than the King, the former King of Rumania. The people only received 200 grams per day, against an identity card.
These two defendants have robbed the people, and not even today do they want to talk. They are cowards. We have data concerning both of them. I ask the chairman of the prosecutor's office to read the bill of indictment.
 
HAIRMAN OF THE PROSECUTOR'S OFFICEEsteemed chairman of the court, today we have to pass a verdict on the defendants Nicolae Ceausescu and Elena Ceausescu, who have committed the following offenses:
Crimes against the people. They carried out acts that are incompatible with human dignity and social thinking, they acted in a despotic and criminal way, they destroyed the people whose leaders they claimed to be. Because of the crimes they committed against the people, I plead, on behalf of the victims of these two tyrants, for the death sentence for the two defendants.
The bill of indictment contains the following points: 1. Genocide in accordance with Article 356 of the penal code. 2. Armed attack on the people and the state power, in accordance with Article 163 of the penal code. The destruction of buildings and state institutions, undermining of the national economy, in accordance with Article 165 and 145 of the penal code. They obstructed the normal process of the economy.
 
PROSECTORDid you hear the charges? Have you understood them?
 
CEAUSESCUI do not answer. I will only answer questions before the grand National Assembly. I do not recognize this court. The charges are incorrect, and I will not answer a single question here.
 
PROSECTORNote. He does not recognize the points mentioned in the bill of indictment.
 
CEAUSESCUI will not sign anything.
 
PROSECTORThis situation is known. The catastropic situation of the country is known all over the world. Every honest citizen who worked hard here until Dec. 22 knows that we do not have medicines, that you have killed children and other people in this way, that there is nothing to eat, no heating, no electricity.
Translator: Elena and Nicolae reject this. Another question to Ceausescu: Who ordered the bloodbath in Timisoara? Ceausescu refuses to answer.
 
PROSECUTORWho gave the order to shoot in Bucharest, for instance?
 
CEAUSESCUI do not answer.
 
PROSECTORWho ordered the shooting into the crowd? Tell us?
Translator: At that moment Elena says to Nicolae: Forget about them. You see, there is no use in talking to these people.
 
PROSECUTORDo you not know anything about the order to shoot?
Translator: Nicolae reacts with astonishment.
 
PROSECUTOR There is still shooting going on. Fanatics, whom you are paying. They are shooting at children, they are shooting arbitrarily into the apartments. Who are these fanatics? Are they the people, or are you paying them?
 
CEASESCUI will not answer. I will not answer any question. Not a single shot was fired in Palace Square. Not a single shot. No one was shot.
 
PROSECUTORBy now, there have been 34 casualties.
Translator: She says cynically! Look, and that they are calling genocide.
 
PROSECUTOR In all district capitals, which you grandly called municipalities, there is shooting going on. The people were slaves. The entire intelligentsia of the country ran away. No one wanted to do anything for you anymore.
 
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKERMr. President, I would like to know something. The accused should tell us who the mercenaries are. Who pays them? And who brought them into the country?
 
PROSECUTORYes. Accused, answer.
 
CEAUSESCU I will not say anything more. I will only speak at the Grand National Assembly.
Translator: Elena keeps whispering something to him. Prosecutor: Elena has always been talkative, but otherwise she does not know much. I have observed that she is not even able to read correctly, but she calls herself an university graduate.
Translator: Elena answers: The intellectuals of this country should hear you, you and your colleagues.
Translator: The prosecutor cites all academic titles she has always claimed to have.
 
ELENA CEAUSESCU The intelligentsia of the country will hear what you are accusing us of. ...
Translator: Prosecutor: The world already knows what has happened here.
CEAUSESCU I will not answer you putschists.
 
PROSECUTOR The Grand National Assembly has been dissolved. CEAUSESCUThis is not possible at all. No one can dissolve the National Assembly.
 
PROSECUTORWe now have another leading organ. The National Salvation Front is now our supreme body.
 
CEAUSESCUNo one recognizes that. That is why the people are fighting all over the country. This gang will be destroyed. They organized the putsch.
 
PROSECUTORThe people are fighting against you, not against the new forum.
 
CEAUSESCUNo, the people are fighting for freedom and against the new forum. I do not recognize the court.
 
PROSECUTORWhy do you think that people are fighting today? What do you think?
 
CEAUSESCU As I said before, the people are fighting for their freedom and against this putsch, against this usurpation.
Translator: Ceausescu claims that the putsch was organized from abroad. ...
Translator: The prosecutor asks the counsel for the defense to ask Ceausescu whether he knows that he is no longer President of the country and that Elena Ceausescu has also lost all her official state functions, and that the Government has been dissolved.
The prosecutor wants to find out on which basis the trial can be continued. It must be cleared up whether Ceausescu wants to, should, must, or can answer at all. At the moment the situation is rather uncertain.
Now the counsel for the defense, who was appointed by the court, asks whether Nicolae and Elena Ceausescu know the aforementioned facts - that he is no longer President, that she has lost all official functions. He answers:
 
CEAUSESCU I am the President of Romania and I am the Commander in Chief of the Rumainian Army. No one can deprive me of these functions.
 
PROSECUTOR But not of our army, you are not the Commander in Chief of our army.
 
CEAUSESCUI do not recognize you. I am talking to you as simple citizens at the least, as simple citizens, and I tell you: I am the President of Romania.
 
PROSECUTOR What are you really?
 
CEAUSESCU I repeat: I am the President of Rumania and the Commander in Chief of the Rumanian Army. I am the President of the people. I will not speak with you provocateurs anymore, and I will not speak with the organizers of the putsch and with the mercenaries. I have nothing to do with them.
 
PROSECUTORYes, but you are paying the mercenaries.
 
CEAUSESCUNo, no --
 
ELENA CEAUSESCUIt is incredible what they ae inventing, incredible.
 
PROSECUTOR Please, make a note: Ceausescu does not recognize the new legal structures of power of the country. He still considers himself to be the country's President and the Commander in Chief of the army.
Why did you ruin the country so much? Why did you export everything? Why did you make the peasants starve? The produce which the peasants grew was exported and the peasants came from the most remote provinces to Bucharest and to the other cities in order to buy bread. They cultivated the soil in line with your valuable orders and had nothing to eat. Why did you starve the people?
 
CEAUSESCUI will not answer this question. As a simple citizen, I tell you the following: For the first time I guaranteed that every peasant receives 200 kg. wheat per person, not per family, and that he is entitled to more. It is a lie that I made the people starve. A lie, a lie in my face. This shows how little patriotism there is, how many treasonable offenses were committed.
 
PROSECUTORYou claim to have taken measures so that every peaant is entitled to 200 kg. wheat. Why do the peasants then buy their bread in Bucharest?
Translator: The prosecutor quotes Ceausescu, Ceausescu's program.
 
PROSECUTORWe have wonderful programs. Paper is patient. However why are your programs not implemented? You have destroyed the Rumanian villages and the Rumanian soil. What do you say as a citizen?
 
CEAUSESCUAs a citizen, as a simple citizen, I tell you the following: At no point was there such an upswing, so much construction, so much consolidation in the Rumanian provinces. I guaranteed that every village has its schools, hospitals and doctors. I have done everything to create a decent and rich life for the people in the country, like in no other country in the world. ...
 
PROSECUTORWe have always spoken of equality. We are all equal. Everybody should be paid according to his performance. Now we finally saw your villa on television, the golden plates from which you ate, the foodstuffs that you had imported, the luxurious celebrations, pictures from your luxurious celebrations.
 
ELENA CEAUSESCUIncredible. We live in a normal apartment, just like every other citizen. We have ensured an apartment for every citizen through corresponding laws.
 
PROSECUTORYou had palaces.
 
CEAUSESCUNo, we had no palaces. The palaces belong to the people.
Translator: The prosecutor agrees, but stresses that they lived in them while the people suffered.
 
PROSECUTORChildren cannot even buy plain candy, and you are living in the palaces of the people.
 
CEAUSESCUIs it possible that we are facing such charges?
 
PROSECUTORLet us now talk about the accounts in Switzerland, Mr. Ceausescu. What about the accounts?
 
ELENA CEAUSESCUAccounts in Switzerland? Furnish proof!
 
CEAUSESCUWe had no account in Switzerland. Nobody has opened an account. This shows again how false the charges are. What defamation, what provocations! This was a coup d'etat.
 
PROSECUTIONWell, Mr. defendant, if you had no accounts in Switzerland, will you sign a statement confirming that the money that may be in Switzerland should be transferred to the Rumanian state, the state bank?
 
CEAUSESCUWe will discuss this before the Grand National Assembly. I will not say anything here. This is a vulgar provocation. ...
 
PROSECUTORNote the following: the defendant refuses to sign this statement. ...
Translator: The prosecutor to Elena: You have always been wiser and more ready to talk, a scientist. You were the most important aide, the number two in the Cabinet, in the Government.
 
PROSECUTORDid you know about the genocide in Timisoara?
 
ELENA CEAUSESCUWhat genocide? By the way, I will not answer any more questions.
 
PROSECUTORDid you know about the genocide or did you, as a chemist, only deal with polymers? You as a scientist, did you know about it?
Translator: Here Nicolae Ceausescu steps in and defends her.
 
CEAUSESCUHer scientific papers were published abroad!
 
PROSECUTORAnd who wrote the papers for you, Elena?
 
ELENA CEAUSESCUSuch impudence! I am a member and the chairwoman of the Academy of Sciences. You cannot talk to me in such a way!
 
PROSECUTORThat is to say, as a Deputy Prime Minister you did not know about the genocide? ...
 
CEAUSESCUShe was not a deputy prime minister, but the First Deputy Prime Minister!
 
PROSECUTORThis is how you worked with the people and exercised your functijons! But who gave the order to shoot? Answer this question!
 
ELENA CEAUSESCUI will not answer. I told you right at the beginning that I will not answer a single question.
 
CEAUSESCUYou as officers should know that the Government cannot give the order to shoot. But those who shot at the young people were the security men, the terrorists.
Translator: Elena Ceausescu explains.
 
ELENA CEAUSESCUThe terrorists are from Securitate.
 
PROSECUTORThe terrorists are from Securitate?
 
ELENA CEAUSESCUYes.
 
PROSECUTORAnd who heads Securitate? ...
Translator: The court notes that the investigations have been concluded. Then follows the reading of the indictment.
 
PROSECUTORMr. Chairman, we find the two accused guilty of having committed criminal actions according to the following articles of the penal code: Articles 162, 163, 165, and 357. Because of the indictment, I call for the death sentence and the impounding of the entire property of the two accused.
 
PROSECUTORSo far, they have always claimed that we have built this country, we have paid our debts, but with this they bled the country to death and have hoarded enough money to ensure their escape. You need not admit your mistakes, mister. In 1947, we assumed power, but under completely different circumstances. In 1947, King Mihai showed more dignity than you. And you might perhaps have achieved the understanding of the Rumanian people if you had now admitted your guilt. You should have stayed in Iran where you had flown to.
Translator: In response, the two laugh and she says: We do not stay abroad. This is our home.
Ceausescu is accused of having never understood what was important in this country, of having never understood the people, and of course, he does not understand the seriousness of the current moment, either.
 
PROSECUTOREsteemed Mr. Chairman, I have been one of those who, as a lawyer, would have liked to oppose the death sentence, because it is inhuman. But we are not talking about people. I would not call for the death sentence, but it would be incomprehensible for the Rumanian people to have to go on suffering this great misery and not to have it ended by sentencing the two Ceausescus to death. The crimes against the people grew year by year. They were only busy enslaving the people and building up an apparatus of power. They were not really interested in the people. (Picture is cut off).
Translator: After an outage of transmission of Rumanian television, the speaker announces the verdict in the trial of Elena and Nicolae Ceausescu is the death sentence. All their property will be impounded.

HEADLINE: Florida Migrant Workers Seek Aid After Freeze

HEADLINE: Home Thoughts of a Rumanian At a College Haven in the U.S.

BYLINE: By RICHARD F. SHEPARD

 BODY:
Last December when Norman Manea was invited to exercise freedom of thought as a writer and a teacher at Bard College, nobody foresaw what would be happening in Eastern Europe.
Mr. Manea is a 53-year-old author from Rumania, the last of the Warsaw Pact countries to oust a Stalinist leader. His comments and his philosophies had earned him the obloquy of official Rumanian publications as an elitist and a Jew, a situation that encouraged him three years ago to seek more tolerant surroundings in the West.
Why the authorities let him out is one of those unanswerable questions that often arose about Eastern bloc countries before the glacier began its precipitate thaw. Mr. Manea said yesterday that it was more than coincidence that writers were in the forefront of the recent upheavals in that part of the world.
His writings, novels and short stories have been published in German, Dutch, Hebrew, Spanish, Swedish and lately English. 
 
The Main Offering: Freedom
The program that brought him to the Bard College campus at Annandale-on-Hudson in Dutchess County is recent and is intended, in the words of its prospectus, to ''provide serious and gifted writers, scholars and artists from outside of the United States and Western Europe, who are living under conditions that do not permit the free development and expression of their accomplishments or their ideas, with the opportuniy to pursue their work in a nonpartisan environment in this country.''
It is called the International Academy for Scholarship and the Arts and was established by Bard with the help of a $100,000 grant from the Ford Foundation. The academy is actually a consortium of liberal arts colleges, among them Bryn Mawr, Dartmouth, Davidson, Haverford, St. Augustine's, Vassar and Lincoln University. Mr. Manea is the second participant in the program; the first was Miklos Haraszti, a Hungarian dissident writer, poet and sociologist, who was chosen for 1988-89.
The burst of liberalization in Eastern Europe is not a threat to the program, but it will probably cause a change in direction in the quest for writers who have governments reading over their shoulders.
''It will shift the focus,'' said Leon Botstein, the president of Bard. ''There has always been the assumption that it would go from place to place. Freedom of expression is a problem elsewhere as well. There is China as well as countries in the Middle East and Africa. We originally said we hoped the program would not be for East Europe alone. Now it turns out, East Europe needs it least.''
 
Fellowships Offered Elsewhere
Bryn Mawr and Vassar have each given fellowships to Chinese intellectuals. Bryn Mawr's is to a physicist and Vassar's to an economist.
Mr. Botstein explained that the participants in the program need not be engaged in the struggle against dictatorship.
''Writing in un-freedom creates codes through allusion and imagery,'' Mr. Botstein said. ''Where Americans think of these as literary techniques, in other countries they are used as a method of communication, as a way of preserving memory. Much of the political discussion is done through allusions to the past.
''Our judgment of freedom is one of movement. What is freedom for these people is freedom of expression. What Haraszti and Manea are transmitting to American students is that ideas matter. How little Americans know about European intellectuals! The role of being an intellectual is not to earn a living; you are one because it has political consequences, you find a voice to exert leadership. In the United States, an intellectual is often considered marginal, an esthete, but there he or she is at the center of things.''
 
The Ignorance of Americans
Mr. Manea, now almost at midpoint in his stay at Bard, has found academia in America to have areas of self-inflicted ignorance. The course he is teaching is called East European writers, and those under scrutiny include, among many others, Milan Kundera and Josef Shvorecky of Czechoslovakia, the Rumanian Eugene Ionesco and Danilo Kis, a Yugoslav who died just this year.
''I have 24 students,'' Mr. Manea said. ''I think there is a lower level here in a general cultural way. Some students are very good, intelligent, innocent and honest, like good students in Europe, but they lack knowledge and their political knowledge is lower. They are not familiar with Eastern Europe, even though they are interested in what's happening there. They are not really prepared in high school for the geography and history, so I started the class with a map that shows where East Europe and its capitals are.''
''The students are also different from students in Europe because very few have other languages,'' he said. ''I find it very interesting to understand the American youth and I hope it's interesting for them to understand me.''
In the spring, Mr. Manea will be teaching the other of his two courses, Holocaust and literature, a study of short fiction and novels by Franz Kafka, I. B. Singer, Primo Levi, Giorgio Bassani and others. It is a subject he is also pursuing under a Fulbright Scholarship.
 
Preoccupations of a Survivor
Mr. Manea, who was born in Bukovina in 1936, was deported in 1941 to a concentration camp in the Ukraine, where he remained with surviving family members until 1945. As a survivor of extermination policies, physical on the part of Nazis, intellectual on the part of the Communists, the author is immersed in these subjects. He has observed how the techniques of one may be applied by the other, and his 10 books, mostly novels, reflect behavior that threatened physical extermination in the Nazi camps and literary extermination under Stalinist rule.
The literary war began for him in 1981 when, in an interview, he called for writers to take stronger moral stances and reacted to anti-Semitic articles published in Rumanian periodicals. For years afterward, Mr. Manea was subjected to anti-Semitic attacks in the press. In 1986 a collection of his essays won the Prize of the Writer's Union of Rumania. The Government-run Council of Socialist Culture rescinded the prize. His wife was working and this helped tide them over periods when his own income was diminished.
''Anti-Semitism was only one aspect of a dark situation,'' the writer said in in a discussion of the era just ended. ''It was not the most important, but only one of the characteristics of an economic, political and moral crisis that was linked to all of the other aspects of crisis. Forms of life, of creation, of resistance, sustain themselves today in Rumania as much as possible through culture. That is why hatred and repression is primarily directed against cultural figures. When these figures are Jews also, there are also supplementary 'accents' to attack.
''We saw how important culture was in bringing about the changes in Rumania, because we saw a gifted poet, Mircea Dinescu, as the first to announce news of the change. I think that it's not by chance that we now have the President of Czechoslovakia a playwright, the Prime Minister of Poland a journalist and the announcement of change in Rumania by a courageous poet.''
 
A U.S. Book Contract
Mr. Manea has signed a book contract with Grove Press for publication of his short stories that follow a single character from childhood to maturity, first during the Holocaust and then during the Stalinist decades. Mr. Manea said that the book may be out in English translation by the end of next year.
When he first arrived in America, Mr. Manea was reluctant to speak too bluntly about Rumania's ruling class so that he might keep a foot in the door if he wanted to return. Now his last family ties with the old country have been cut and life in the West gave him a taste of freedom even before the turbulent unshackling of repression in his native land.
''My situation has changed,'' he said, ''and I can speak more freely. But the revolution in Eastern Europe went to the intellectuals. We saw that the writer is not only at his desk but in the public squares.''

HEADLINE: Koch Takes His Leave From City Hall

BYLINE: By RICHARD LEVINE

 BODY:
Edward I. Koch walked out of City Hall for the last time as mayor yesterday, his passionate and sometimes obstreperous tenure as New York City's chief executive virtually at an end.
Mr. Koch spent the last weekday of his 12th year in office writing letters, visiting several police precincts, taping a television program, attending an open house at City Hall for senior city employees and coping with one more emergency: a Bronx explosion that left large portions of that borough and Manhattan without electricity, disrupted subway service and delayed Mr. Koch's departure from the building by about a half-hour.
The Mayor's third term officially ends at midnight tomorrow, but aides said he had no plans to return to City Hall, which has so long been his domain, until Monday morning, when his successor, David N. Dinkins, will be inaugurated as the city's 106th mayor.
Mr. Koch seemed in an upbeat mood throughout the day, in keeping with his often repeated assertion these days that his defeat in the September primary was actually his ''liberation.''
 
'I Leave With Joy'
''People think that somehow or other I should be forlorn,'' he said as he chatted with reporters in the morning. ''Not at all. I leave with joy.'' 
The Mayor's public schedule for the day had only one entry: the open house, which was in keeping with a tradition observed when his two predecessors, John V. Lindsay and Abraham D. Beame, left office.
But when he returned to City Hall in the late afternoon after a stop at a police station house in Manhattan, he got a surprise: members of the Pipes and Drums of the Police Department's Emerald Society had assembled on the steps leading up through the rotunda. As he stood on the landing, looking out at hundreds of colleagues, supporters and friends and listening to the bagpipes, he sighed several times and appeared to be fighting to maintain his composure.
Asked a few moments later whether he had cried, Mr. Koch said, ''A tear or two.''
Then he slowly made his way through the crowd to his office in the west wing, where the paintings and photographs had already been removed from the walls, save for the official portrait of Fiorello H. La Guardia. There, Mr. Koch discussed the Bronx explosion and its impact with aides and with Mr. Dinkins, who had stopped by, the Mayor-elect said, to say ''hello and goodbye'' to his predecessor.
At an impromptu news conference in the Blue Room, Mr. Koch said he had been reassured that power would be restored within an hour. The Mayor said he would stay in City Hall until the situation had been resolved. ''This is no imposition,'' he said. ''This is my job.''
He left City Hall at 5:38 P.M., making his way across the inaugural platform and then taking the arm of Diane Mulcahy Coffey, his chief of staff.
 
Subdued Mood
The building had an outwardly festive appearance yesterday, with its facade already bedecked with bunting and banners. But inside, dozens of cardboard boxes containing mayoral papers were stacked in the halls, destined for the archives and for Mr. Koch's new apartment.
As commissioners and others gathered for the open house, the mood was subdued. Asked if it were a sad occasion, Stanley E. Grayson, who is leaving his post as Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development, said, ''Melancholy is perhaps a better way to describe it.''
In any event, the party did not last long. Workers had picked up the rugs and begun cleaning up by 6 P.M.
Mr. Koch arose yesterday at 5 A.M., a half-hour earlier than usual, went to his gym, stopped by the 113 Police Precinct station house in Jamaica, Queens - one of three he would visit during the day - and had breakfast with the author Alistair Cooke at the Carlyle Hotel, breaking yet another mayoral diet, an aide said.
 
Saying Farewell in Person
Chatting with reporters in the morning, he jokingly likened the goings-on at the seat of municipal government to the fall of Saigon. The only thing missing, he said, ''was the sound of the helicopters to take you out.''
Later, he taped a television interview program at the studios of WCBS-TV, learned of the Bronx fire and visited the site, then stopped by two more police station houses in the Bronx and Manhattan.
He said he planned to visit three more station houses over the weekend, fulfilling his intention to stop at all 75 precincts in the city and say farewell in person. Mr. Koch said he might go to a movie tonight.
He is scheduled to attend a New Year's Eve ceremony at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, his last official appearance. He will host a party that evening at Gracie Mansion for 75 friends and relatives, then head for his new apartment on lower Fifth Avenue at ''check-out time,'' which he said was 3 A.M. Monday.
 
Several Jobs Ahead
On Tuesday, Mr. Koch said, he will report to the Manhattan law offices of Robinson Silverman Pearce Aronsohn & Berman, where he will be a partner.
Since the primary, Mr. Koch has also accepted jobs as a radio and television commentator, newspaper columnist and lecturer. Though he never discusses specifics, he has made it clear he expects his third career to be his most lucrative.
Mr. Koch was a lawyer and then a City Councilman and a United States Representative before he prevailed over a crowded field in the mayoral campaign of 1977. His tenure began with New York City close to insolvency but spanned a time of unexpected prosperity in which the city's economy, driven largely by Wall Street, boomed, tax revenues soared and the annual municipal budget doubled, to $26 billion.
The Mayor's third term comes to an end, however, with the city once again facing fiscal difficulties. Though its credit rating has remained sound, it is under increasing pressure from social ills like homelessness, AIDS and drug abuse, at a time when it can scarcely afford new programs.
Mr. Koch, who frequently recalled the fiscal troubles he inherited and his role in resolving them during his last, unsucessful campaign, continued to monitor the budget, and his administration has twice modified the spending plan for the fiscal year that ends in June, lowering estimates for revenues and cutting expenses.
But for the most part the Mayor has made few decisions of consequence since losing the primary, keeping an uncharacteristically low profile for a politican some considered a quintessentially feisty New Yorker, others considered divisive and abrasive and still others, no doubt, regarded as both.
His quiescence, along with his support for Mr. Dinkins, were credited with helping fuel what has been characterized as a wave of ''premature nostalgia'' for a political figure who was once overwhelmingly popular but saw support fade after a series of corruption cases at the start of his third term and his harsh criticism of the Rev. Jesse Jackson during the New York State Presidential primary in 1986.
''Reporters who beat the hell out of me are suddenly saying nice things about me,'' Mr. Koch noted last week. ''When you've been defeated, you don't make any decision of great importance, and when you don't make decisions you don't alienate anybody.''
 
Raising Mayor's Ire
That is not to say that Mr. Koch has always held his tongue. On Thursday, at his last bill signing, he listened as some black residents of South Jamaica, Queens, and others argued with police officers and officials who had gathered in the Blue Room to speak on a law renaming a street for Edward Byrne, an officer slain while guarding the home of a witness in a drug case.
When several speakers could not resist pointing out that the Mayor would soon be the ex-Mayor, and some taking credit for the transformation, the Mayor merely listened. But when others said that the officer did not deserve to be memorialized, it prompted the Mayor's ire.
Before signing the bill, Mr. Koch said some of the comments ''sickened me . . . as nothing has in 12 years.''
He told that story a few times yesterday. But Mr. Koch seemed determined to end his tenure as gracefully as he could.
''I'm grateful to God and the people of New York City - I hope nobody objects to me putting God first - who gave me an opportunity,'' he said at one point. ''I thank them.''
Even so, when he saw the platform on which Mr. Dinkins would take the oath of office on Monday, he could not resist joking that it was ''at least twice and maybe three times as big as the platform they had for me.''
After a pause and a smile, he added, ''He's entitled to it.''

HEADLINE: Businesses Press Cuomo to Keep Income-Tax Cut Set for Next Year

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Dec. 29

 BODY:
Despite appeals from the Cuomo administration, business groups across New York State are preparing for a high-pressure campaign to save the income-tax cut scheduled for next year.
''Tax cuts are not the problem, spending is,'' the Upstate New York Roundtable on Manufacturing asserted in a statement recently. The group, representing more than 100 manufacturers, declared itself ''strongly opposed to any delay or repeal'' of the tax cut and vowed to press state lawmakers on the issue when they return to Albany next month. 
The Greater Syracuse Chamber of Commerce went a step further, assembling ''save the tax cut'' kits to make lobbying easy. The kits contain sample protest letters urging lawmakers to preserve the tax cut, as well as orange balloons bearing the message ''Don't Let the Air Out of NY's Economy.'' For $37.50, a company can buy 25 kits.
 
Fierce Fight Likely
Earlier this month, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's economic advisory committee, whose members include some of the most prominent business leaders in New York, suggested that the tax cut be delayed to help the state solve its fiscal problems. The report seemed to indicate that the Governor had won support from business for a delay in the tax cut.
But the protests from business groups, coming even before the Governor has announced his proposed budget for next year, indicate that he has not succeeded in swaying much of the state's business community. And given the power that business has traditionally wielded in Albany, especially in the Republican-controlled State Senate, it augurs a fierce fight over the tax cut next year.
For the last several months, Governor Cuomo has been toying with the idea of delaying the next phase of the state's tax-cut program, suggesting over and over that the money could be better used fighting drugs or improving education. But he has refused to say whether he will propose delaying the tax cut when he presents his budget next month, and aides to Mr. Cuomo insist that he has not yet made up his mind on the issue.
The next phase of the four-year tax-cut program, initiated in 1987, is scheduled to bring the state's top income-tax rate down to 7 percent from 7.5 percent. It would cost the state an estimated $400 million during the fiscal year that starts April 1, at the same time that the state is facing a budget gap estimated at more than $1 billion.
Over the summer, Mr. Cuomo appealed to business groups to keep an open mind on the tax cut. Some groups, like the New York City Chamber of Commerce and Industry, have heeded the Governor's call and refrained from taking a firm position on the issue. But a growing number of business groups, including the state's largest business lobby, the Business Council of New York State, have come out against a delay.

THE ECONOMY
 
The index of leading indicators edged up 0.1 percent in November after modestly declining in October, the Commerce Department reported. That was in line with expectations and was seen as a further indication that the nation's sharply slower economic growth is unlikely to deteriorate into a recession. Five of the index's 11 components contributed to the increase, led by a rise in manufacturers' new orders for consumer goods and materials. [33.] 
 
Farmers received 0.7 percent more for raw products in December than in November, the Agriculture Department said. [34.]
 
The United States is headed for permanent levels of dependence on oil imports higher than those that led to havoc in the 1970's, many experts are saying. [33.]
 
MARKETS
 
Stock prices rose strongly, ending the second-best year of the decade, in percentage terms, for the Dow industrials. The Dow settled at 2,753.20, up 20.90 for the day, 41.81 for the week and 584.63, or 27 percent, for the year. [33.]
 
Treasury note and bond prices were mostly lower, and bill rates were mixed, in the final trading session of a year characterized by gradually rising prices of Treasury and investment-grade corporate debt issues and by declining values of ''junk bonds.'' [36.]
 
Prices of heating-oil futures rebounded to close at a six-year high, and gasoline futures jumped amid signs that moves to produce more heating oil are cutting into gas supplies. [41.] The dollar closed higher in light trading. Gold prices rose, with bullion for current delivery ending at $402.50 an ounce on the Comex. [41.]
 
COMPANIES
 
Antonovich Inc. has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The move by the New York-area fur retailer follows the announcement by a competitor, Fur Vault, that it would sell its unprofitable retail operations. Fur retailers face new competition from foreign companies, like Jindo of Korea, and are under pressure from animal rights groups.[33.]
 
Some airlines are seriously considering raising fares or adding ticket surcharges to offset higher fuel prices, people in the industry say. The moves could come just before the time of year when carriers generally cut their fares. [33.]
 
The City of Chicago plans to terminate its franchise agreement with Commonwealth Edison as of Dec. 31, 1990, the company said. Analysts see the action as a first step in negotiations for a new franchise agreement with the big electric utility. [35.]
 
An Australian court appointed receivers and managers for the Bond Corporation's brewing interests. News reports speculated that the move marks the beginning of the end of Alan Bond's diversified empire, which includes G. Heileman in the U.S. [35.]
 
Campbell's chairman said the first choice to become chief executive had accepted the post. The person's name was not announced. [35.]

HEADLINE: Worrying Anew Over Oil Imports

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 29

 BODY:
After a long period of complacency during which American reliance on foreign oil fell sharply and the price dived to under $10 a barrel, the United States is now headed for permanent levels of dependence on imports that are higher than those that led to havoc in the 1970's, many specialists say.
The United States relies on foreign suppliers for 43 percent of its petroleum needs, and some experts say that may go to 60 percent by the turn of the century. But there is a difference this time. The pinch has been gradual, largely because of lessons learned on both sides of the oil equation. That difference makes the risk of a return to gasoline lines seem more remote than in the mid-1970's, when imports last moved above 40 percent.
Still, with the aid of exceptionally cold late autumn and early winter weather in much of the nation, the price of crude oil has climbed to about $22 a barrel. And in trading today on the New York Mercantile Exchange, heating oil jumped to its highest level in almost six years. 
 
Increasingly Worrisome Threat
The combination of higher prices and the fact that daily domestic oil production fell in 1989 by a record 500,000 barrels has many analysts warning that the American dependence on foreign oil will pose an increasingly worrisome threat in many ways in the 1990's.
''One of the most serious issues facing the United States is how to cope with the growing imports of crude oil and refined products that arise from increased consumption combined with declining domestic production,'' a diverse panel of international business, labor, government and other specialists concluded in a report published this month by the Atlantic Council, a Washington-based center that specializes in economic and other international issues. ''This aggravates balance-of-payments problems, adds to the budget deficit, is likely to lead to higher world oil prices and affects national security.''
Addressing some of the concerns in a speech in London in October, Hisham M. Nazer, oil minister for Saudi Arabia, made it clear that maintaining a steady flow of oil to the West was in the best interests of producers and consumers alike, saying it was ''a purely commercial equation.'' He added: ''We will add political variables to it only to our mutual peril. Let me simplify it even further. You need the oil. We have the oil.''
 
U.S. Output May Fall Further
Although some in the industry believe that American production can at least be stabilized and that the decline can probably be reversed with single-minded efforts, most analysts expect that environmental and other constraints will cause production to continue to fall. This year's average of 7.6 million barrels a day, down from 8.1 million in 1988, was the fourth straight annual decline and was the lowest production level since 1964. Output peaked at 9.6 million barrels a day in 1970.
James E. Akins, a former Ambassador to Saudi Arabia, said in an interview that he considers this a ''frightening'' trend and held that the United States would be ''lucky'' to hold its imports at the turn of the century to the 60 percent that the Department of Energy forecasts to be the worst eventuality.
Spurred by the sharp increases in the world price of oil, which curbed demand and elicited large new supplies from Western sources that could get a decent return for the money they have sunk into new wells, the 1980's was a period of relative energy complacency. President Jimmy Carter's 1977 declaration of the ''moral equivalent of war'' to head off possible national catastrophe was largely forgotten.
American dependence on foreign oil dropped to 28 percent over all in 1982 and 1983, from a peak of 46.5 percent in 1977, and the reliance on Middle East sources dwindled even further as Britain, Mexico, Nigeria and Norway joined Canada in the forefront of American suppliers.
 
Causes of U.S. Complacency
Even a long war in the Persian Gulf between major oil producers, Iran and Iraq, failed to give oil much urgency as pipeline networks expanded, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries fell into disarray over quotas and the United States endured a severe two-year recession. In 1986, the price of oil collapsed, falling briefly in the spot market to less than $10 a barrel, from $27 at the beginning of 1986.
Meanwhile, the United States was building a strategic reserve along the coasts of Louisiana and Texas that now holds 580 million barrels -enough to replace all imports for about 80 days - and allies have also created stockpiles.
But with American production in the late 1980's slumping badly and the economy riding on seven years of practically uninterrupted growth, imports are again looming large. At an average 7.3 million barrels a day in the four weeks ended Dec. 15, imports are about 500,000 barrels higher than a year ago and 1.2 million above the levels of November-December 1987.
 
Oil at 44% of U.S. Trade Deficit
Although imported oil costs the nation less than one-tenth as much as President Carter once feared it would cost by 1985, the $49 billion or so it will cost this year can only increase, many analysts agree. Moreover, oil's proportion of the American trade deficit was more than 44 percent through the first 10 months of the 1989. In some months it was more than half.
Most worrisome to various analysts, however, is the prospect that OPEC appears to be regaining leverage as demand rises, particularly in the third world and perhaps also before long in Eastern Europe, as production falls elsewhere. Britain, as well as the United States, is now beyond peak output, and many specialists believe that the Soviet Union, the world's biggest producer, may have to reduce exports even if it manages to keep output from falling.
To be sure, other industrial powerhouses like West Germany and Japan must import nearly all their oil. But they and most other countries tax it at near-punitive rates and use it much more sparingly.
 
Drop in OPEC's Share of Market
OPEC had seen its share of the world market drop to less than a third in 1985, from about half during the 1970's. It is now benefiting handsomely, however, as strong demand, aided by very cold weather in the United States, has helped push the price back up to $22 a barrel.
''World oil consumption is again on the rise, and OPEC's dominance is being re-established,'' asserted the Jefferson Energy Foundation, a Washington group that promotes United States oil production.
What's more, some analysts note, the OPEC members in the Persian Gulf - Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Iran and Iraq -are for various reasons becoming even more influential within the organization, at the expense of Indonesia, Nigeria and other members.
 
'Serious Geopolitical Issues'
''There is general agreement that proven world oil reserves are adequate to meet world needs and U.S. import requirements for several decades,'' the Atlantic Council report said. ''However, production will become increasingly concentrated in a few countries, in particular the Arabian Gulf producers. This raises serious geopolitical issues for the U.S. and its allies as dependence on the Middle East grows. The cost of oil imports for the U.S. economy could double between now and the year 2000 -from eight-tenths of 1 percent of gross national product to 1.5 percent of G.N.P.''
Edward H. Murphy, an official of the American Petroleum Institute, agrees.
''For sure,'' he said, ''OPEC is going to have more control in the 90's than in the 80's.'' The question, Mr. Murphy added, is whether it will be disciplined enough to bring about steady, albeit moderate, price increases over the long term or whether short-term demands for revenue could cause wild gyrations and instability.
 
OPEC Capacity Race Possible
Some, in fact, believe a capacity race has already begun within OPEC - with major expasions reportedly planned by Saudi Arabia, the other Gulf producers and Venezuela - that could raise its production capability 20 percent by the mid-1990's and prevent the group from reasserting effective power to increase prices. Mr. Murphy said this race could occur but so far ''we haven't seen the evidence'' of significant actual expansion.
Still the Atlantic Council panel sees such a threat to oil sufficiency - as well as being worried about pollution, climatic change and the need for highway repair - that it proposes an additional 50-cent-a-gallon Federal tax on gasoline, to be phased in over nine years.
The idea of a stiff gasoline levy to curb demand and raise revenue has been endorsed by various Government and other officials but hotly opposed, among others reasons, as unfair to drivers in the West where trips are generally longer.

HEADLINE: New Economic Puzzle: East Bloc

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Dec. 29

 BODY:
The upheaval in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe has many American economists scrambling to understand the biggest issue in economics today: how to transform a centrally run economy into one dominated by free markets.
Only a handful of economists in the United States, probably fewer than 200, are expert in Eastern bloc countries, having rejected the study of these non-market economies as a dull specialty. Equally important, a main tool of American economists - computer simulations of existing economies - cannot be easily adapted to those in radical transition.
''Most of us don't know how the Eastern bloc institutions and state enterprises work or how to model an economy that is half market-driven and half controlled by bureaucrats,'' said Robert M. Solow of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
 
Shortcomings Evident
The shortcomings were evident in interviews here at the annual convention of the American Economic Association, attended by several thousand economists, most of them college and university professors. 
Mr. Solow, for example, said he had made his first trip to the Soviet Union only last fall - a weekend excursion from Stockholm, where he had attended the Nobel Prize ceremonies. (He won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science in 1987.) Other American economists are visiting the East bloc, while Russian and Eastern European economists -equally puzzled about transition economics - are coming here. Several were among the economists who attended the convention that ends Saturday, among them Jaroslaw Pietras, a 34-year-old University of Warsaw professor on a Fulbright fellowship at Duke University.
''The transition will inevitably bring irrational behavior from people not used to the unemployment and dislocation that come with free markets,'' Mr. Pietras said. ''In your more stable country, economists aren't trained to deal with unexpected behavior.''
Nevertheless, Mr. Pietras is studying American trade practices that might be applied in Poland. And Russian economists are turning to Westerners steeped in free markets.
''If you are the head of a Russian economics institution, the status thing to do is to have some American economists as consultants,'' said Ed A. Hewett, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. As one of the handful of American specialists in Soviet economics, he consults almost daily with his Russian colleagues. He brought one, Genadi Zateev of Gosplan, the Soviet state planning agency, to the conference, and Mr. Zateev declared, rather metaphorically, that the Russian economy was experiencing one of its worst years since World War II.
''The old system has been condemned and a new one not created, so the economy is between two chairs,'' he said. ''It looks like someone standing in front of a curved mirror -bifurcated.''
Mr. Zateev spoke at a session on transition economics conducted by Mr. Hewett. It was so crowded that a loudspeaker was set up for the overflow of professors seated on folding chairs in the hallway. Besides Mr. Zateev, the session featured various American economists speculating on the first steps in tranforming a centrally planned system to a market economy.
 
No Guide and Few Precedents
They noted that there is almost no literature to guide them and very few precedents. Through most of the postwar period economists everywhere assumed that free market and centrally planned systems would exist separately, in a sort of permanent standoff, and neither would evolve into the other.
''I never had a course in graduate school called how to create a market economy,'' said Mr. Hewett, a University of Michigan graduate in the 1960's. Now he and others, including Janos Horvath, a Hungarian-born professor at Butler University, are organizing weeklong sessions, starting next month, at which American and Eastern economists will try to work out transition theory.
The difficulties in doing this were evident at Mr. Hewett's session. The panelists rejected the cold-turkey approach in which a country goes quickly from central planning to free markets, as Poland is more or less attempting to do. This approach calls for the creation of a convertible currency, commercial loans, private companies, new tax laws, and an end to price controls and state subsidies of unprofitable operations - all in one temporarily chaotic swoop.
Among the chief obstacles to the cold-turkey transition cited by the Mr. Hewett's panelists is the huge sums of money held by Russians and many Eastern Europeans who have been forced to save because their economies produced so little to buy.
 
How to Harness Savings
As a means of harnessing this ''savings overhang,'' Ronald I. McKinnon of Stanford University, who has immersed himself in transition economics, proposed a ban on credit to newly entrepreneurial companies in the East, forcing them instead to finance expansion through accumulated profits.
Profits would be big because the companies, as they grew, would be able to raise prices easily, confident that consumers would spend their savings on the new supply of sought-after goods without quibbling over price. Only after the excess savings had been absorbed would credit be allowed and restrictions on imports be fully lifted.
Neither Mr. McKinnon nor anyone else knows whether this strategy would work. He and others suggest it in part because something similar was successfully imposed on West Germany after World War II. The allied forces issued too much occupation currency and the Germans had a lot of money in their pockets. To absorb it, the allies forced companies to pay for rebuilding in the late 1940's with their own funds. To get those funds, the companies pushed up prices and thus increased their profits.
 
Dedicated to Mathematics
But this sort of theorizing is not the way most American economists operate, dedicated as their profession is to mathematical formulas run on computers to simulate the real world. Economists use these models to determine what might happen to car prices, the value of the dollar, wage levels or unemployment if, say, consumer interest rates were moved up or down by a percentage point.
But such models operate best in static economies where assumptions about people's reactions can be built into the equations. But these models are not very useful in transition economics, said Paul Blinder of Princeton University, except for their application to specific issues, such as what effect a currency devaluation in Czechoslovakia might have on that country's exports.
''It is not easy to apply models more broadly to a country that does not know how much like America it wants to look and how to get its economy there,'' he said.
 
Assumption About People
Another problem is that the models rely on an assumption about human behavior that might not hold up well among people who have lived for 40 years in Marxist economies. The assumption is that people in Western economies will always calculate and seek the lowest-priced goods, the highest wage, the best deal - in sum the greatest possible command over goods.
While the concentration on computer modeling fails to equip thousands of American economists for an important role in transition economics, the nation's small group of Marxist economists is not much better off.
Paul Sweezy, the 79-year-old co-editor of the Monthly Review, a socialist journal, explains why. ''A lot of the younger people in the left think that the Eastern Europeans will be good social democrats, but that is fantasy because they can't afford the Swedish type of welfare,'' Mr. Sweezy said. ''I don't know what direction the Soviet Union will go, but the small East European countries will be absorbed in the capitalist world, more or less rapidly.''

HEADLINE: Leading Indicators Rise 0.1%

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 29

 BODY:
The Government index intended to forecast the economy edged up one-tenth of 1 percent in November after a modest October decline, the Commerce Department reported today.
The result, which was in line with expectations, was taken as a further indication that the sharp slowing of economic growth is not likely to deteriorate soon into a downturn.
''The economy is sluggish, but it is not heading into recession,'' said William C. Melton, chief economist for I.D.S. Financial Services in Minneapolis. 
 
Orders Up Sharply
Five of the 11 components of the index of leading indicators contributed to the November increase, paced by a rise in manufacturers' new orders for consumer goods and materials. Of the six elements holding the index down, the biggest was a decline in the price of materials that are particularly sensitive to swings in the business cycle.
Two gauges, compiled by New York investment firms, paint a more negative picture than the Commerce Department's data.
Although the Composite Forecasting Index compiled by Safian Investment Research edged up one-tenth of a point in November, it was only the second advance of the year. The other was in August.
Jesup & Lamont, whose macro-economic index signaled recession in August, said that since the index typically gives five months' warning ''this suggests that the economy is now moving into recession.'' For November, the index fell again, to a reading of minus 71.
The Commerce Department's index, which has now risen six times this year and fallen five, stands at 144.7, scarcely higher than the 144.1 of November 1988.
The other components besides manufacturers' orders that lifted the index last month were a decline in initial claims for state unemployment insurance, a rise in contracts and orders for plant and equipment, a rise in the M-2 money supply and a rise in manufacturers' unfilled orders.
Holding the index back were, besides the decline in sensitive materials prices, lower stock prices, diminished consumer expectations, a decline in the length of the workweek, a decline in building permits and a quickening of deliveries by suppliers.
Revisions to earlier figures show that the leading index eased three-tenths of 1 percent in October, instead of four-tenths as initially reported, while the September gain was one-tenth instead of three-tenths.
The department also reported that its indexes of coincident and lagging indicators each increased four-tenths of 1 percent in November. The rise in the coincident index, which gauges current business activity, was the first since August. The rise in the lagging index, whose components tend to change direction after the economy as a whole, was the biggest since May.

HEADLINE: Stocks Close Strong Year Witha Gain

BYLINE: By PHILLIP H. WIGGINS

 BODY:
Stocks rose strongly yesterday in sharply higher trading, capping the Dow Jones industrial average's second best year of the decade in percentage terms.
For the year, the Dow surged in value by 27 percent and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 27.3 percent. The Dow's gain was the fifth best rise in the postwar years. In 1985, the Dow showed its best rise of the 1980's, 27.7 percent. 
Among the smaller-capitalized stocks, the Nasdaq composite index climbed 4.84 points yesterday, to 454.82, gaining 19.3 percent for the year, while the Amex market value index jumped 4.10 points, to 378.00, and posted a yearly gain of 23.5 percent.
Yesterday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 20.90 points, or 0.76 percent, to 2,753.20, as a late ''window dressing'' rally - when institutions seek to even out their positions -lifted equities in the final minutes of trading. For the week, the Dow gained 41.81 points, or 1.5 percent.
Since Dec. 30, 1988, when the Dow closed out the year at 2,168.57, the Dow has gained 584.63 points.
Advances on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday outnumbered declines by more than 2 to 1, with 1,083 issues gaining in price and 484 retreating. Volume on the Big Board jumped to 145.9 million shares, from 128 million on Thursday.
In the broader market yesterday, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 2.73 points, to 353.40, while the New York Stock Exchange composite index gained 1.45 points, to 195.04, a 24.8 percent gain for the year.
''There were three influences at work in the market today that spurred the rise,'' said David Bostian Jr., managing director and chief investment strategist at the Jesup & Lamont Securities Company. ''One was traders buying depressed stocks; second was index funds putting their cash flow to work at the end of the quarter, and third was the continuation of the institutional portfolio markup that occurs at the end of quarters and the year-end. The latter two will be gone on Tuesday,'' Mr. Bostian continued, ''which will increase the chances that market averages will be headed down.''
 
News on Indicators Ignored
Traders said that the stock market largely ignored the Government's report of a one-tenth of 1 percent rise in the index of leading indicators for November, which was generally in line with expectations.
''Nineteen eighty-nine was an excellent year for the U.S. equity markets,'' said Bernard Spilko, senior vice president at the Zurich-based Bank Julius Baer. ''The Eastern European bloc restructuring should ultimately increase earnings multiples of large U.S. international companies.''
He said that a more relaxed military posture should also help reduce the United States budget deficit, which in turn should allow the Federal Reserve Board to lower interest rates.
 
Good Performance for Year
George O. Zimmermann, director of research at Gruntal & Company, said that the market and the economy's performances this year were a pleasant surprise to many. ''As we entered 1989, the yen was at 125 to the dollar,'' he recalled. ''All was well with 'Smokestack America,' and the trade gap was narrowing. In the meantime, economists were calling for a recession, and the Dow was selling at only 10 times earnings.''
He said he felt the $25 billion buyout of RJR Nabisco Inc. by Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company was the ''high-water mark'' for buyouts of that size, recalling that on Oct. 13 the proposed $8 billion buyout of the UAL Corporation was aborted. ''Carrying through to 1990, we believe that transactions of this nature will not be as frequent because of a weak high-yield bond market,'' Mr. Zimmermann added.
Other analysts said that the new year should bring lower interest rates. They said the recent drop in the Federal funds rate to below 8.5 percent and higher prices for long-term Government bonds could prompt growth in consumer spending. They said that while the nation may slide into a mild recession or slowing economy in 1990, another long-term economic expansion is highly probable, as interest rates reach their lows probably by the summer of 1990.
Active blue chips yesterday included A.T.& T., off 1/8, to 45 1/2; Pan Am, up 1/8, to 3 7/8; Philip Morris, up 1/2, to 41 5/8; I.B.M. unchanged at 94 1/8, and Eastman Kodak, up 3/8, to 41 1/8.

HEADLINE: Prices Paid To Farmers Increase 0.7%

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 29

 BODY:
The prices received by farmers for raw products rose seven-tenths of 1 percent from November to December, leaving the monthly average 2.1 percent above the level of December 1988.
According to the preliminary figures released today by the Agriculture Department, the department's price index averaged a record high for the year, surpassing the record set five years ago.
Higher prices for hogs, cattle, milk and eggs were mostly responsible for the increase from the November average, the department's Agricultural Statistics Board said. Lower prices were reported for lettuce, oranges, cotton and broilers. 
 
Milk Prices Up Sharply
The December milk price was the highest on record, and the average price for hogs was the highest since October 1987.
Most of the price information was collected at midmonth before severe cold swept into Florida and Texas, destroying citrus and vegetable crops. The preliminary figures will be revised next month.
John Buche of the department's National Agricultural Statistics Service said the preliminary 12-month price average for all farm commodities, about 147 percent of a 1977 base figure used for comparison, was the highest on record. The previous high was 142 percent in 1984; the 1988 average was 138 percent.
No new figures were provided on prices that farmers paid to meet expenses. That index is now computed only every three months. The most recent such index, for October, was up 2.9 percent from the comparable 1988 figure.
 
Estimate on Income
On Dec. 20, the department's Economic Research Service estimated that net cash income of farmers in 1989 might be $52 billion to $57 billion, compared with a revised estimate of $57.2 billion in 1988. This would be the fourth straight year in which net cash income exceeded $50 billion.
Department economists say the income decline in 1990 is mostly because of higher expenses as farmers put more land back into crops, and because of reduced Federal payments.
Net cash income is the money that farmers have left from gross cash income after cash expenses, including Government payments and proceeds from crops grown previously but sold during the year. It is not equivalent to profits because it does not take into account depreciation.
Based on the preliminary figures, the December price index for livestock and poultry rose 2.4 percent from November and averaged 9.7 percent more than a year ago.
The meat-animal portion of the index was up 2.9 percent from November and 8.4 percent from December 1988. Dairy prices rose 2.5 percent from November and 18 percent from a year ago.

HEADLINE: Patents;
Financial Instruments Protected

BYLINE: By Edmund L. Andrews

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
ONE of the truisms of the financial services industry - that no good idea goes uncopied -may not be true much longer.
Drawing on the ability to patent their own computer software needed to put their ideas into use, a few companies have patented such financial instruments as a novel certificate of deposit or an insurance policy in recent years.
Thus, they have overcome well-established patent law, which holds that financial products and services, which are ideas rather than inventions, are not eligible for the same patent protection as products. And their patents are being validated at the Patent and Trademark Office and in court. Since the early 1980's, Federal courts have increasingly ruled that software can be patented if it is part of a system that performs a specific function. 
Lawyers warn that the case law in the area is still ambiguous. But the financial implications could be profound for banks, brokerage firms and insurers, which have rarely tried to obtain patents for their ideas in the past. Until now, most companies have had to rely on trademarks, which protect a name or a logotype, and copyrights, which prevent the exact copying of language or symbols.
 
Hint of Change
The first hint of change came in 1983, when Merrill Lynch successfully defended a patent covering its Cash Management Account, a computerized trading account that automatically invests earnings from stocks and bonds in interest- bearing accounts and lets customers borrow against their portfolios. Two rivals, Paine Webber and Dean Witter Reynolds, attacked the patent as invalid, but a Federal judge upheld Merrill Lynch, which then forced its competitors to pay for a license on the idea.
A second suit was resolved in November, when the College Savings Bank of Princeton, N.J., which patented a certificate of deposit used to save for college expenses, sued and obtained royalties from the Centrust Savings Bank of Miami.
During the last two years, a handful of other financial products and services have also been patented. Merrill Lynch has obtained at least two more patents related to its Cash Management Account and a patent for a system to calculate employee relocation costs.
Another patent, issued to Henry L. Fox of Jericho, L.I., covers a method for determining the premium cost for insurance policies against adverse weather conditions. Yet another patent, issued to Jeffrey Cohen and Ian Robertson of Boca Raton, Fla., covers a buying club to offer a novel rebate for members when they purchase goods or services.
 
Particular Calculations
Typically, the patents cover a system that carries out particular calculations crucial to the financial product or service. In effect, this provides patent protection for the financial service itself.
The College Savings Bank, founded by Peter A. Roberts, has come closest to patenting a pure financial instrument. Mr. Roberts invented a certificate of deposit that is guaranteed to provide parents a hedge against inflation in college tuition. The C.D. is based on historical cost data at 500 colleges. The data show that college costs rise faster than the general rate of inflation.
To hedge against that, parents can set aside money for schooling at today's prices - plus an additional amount to cover inflation that exceeds any interest income the money will generate. This allows the College Savings Bank to guarantee that a year's payment of tuition now will cover a year's tuition when the child enters college.
Mr. Roberts obtained three patents on a computer system that calculates the amount required for one year at a particular school and initiated the system in late 1987. When Centrust started selling a similar product last year called College Prep Account, he sued the bank for infringement. In November, Centrust settled the suit by agreeing to pay an unspecified royalty.
Mr. Roberts obtained patents 4,752,877; 4,722,055 and 4,642,768.
 
An Unusual Rebate
Mr. Cohen and Mr. Robertson have patented what amounts to a buying club that will give members an unusual rebate when they buy goods and services.
Under the system, vendors agree to offer goods at a discount to club members, who would also be guaranteed a rebate on each purchase. But the rebate money would be turned over to an insurance company, which would guarantee the customer an annuity after 20 years. The annuity, which would be calculated and tracked by the patented computer system, would be based on the rebates and the accumulated interest and would be a form of retirement savings.
According to the inventors' attorney, Robert C. Kain Jr. of Miami, the inventors never succeeded in commercializing the idea, and patent rights are up for sale. The inventors received patent 4,750,119.
 
Weather Insurance
Mr. Fox patented a method for insuring people against weather from floods to droughts. Using historical data on the frequency of weather conditions in a given area, the system would calculate the likelihood of risk, weigh that against the amount and duration of insurance protection being sought and determine the appropriate premium.

All-Terrain Vechicles: Still a Safety Hazard

BYLINE: By BARRY MEIER

 BODY:
Nearly two years after the birth of an elaborate plan to reduce deaths involving all-terrain vehicles, the number of youngsters being killed in such accidents is little changed.
The Federal Consumer Product Safety Commission estimates that the 1989 death toll in such accidents will be about 299, with 40 percent of the dead being children under 16 years old.
Injuries, however, have declined in the last three years. All-terrain vehicles have oversize tires capable of traversing rugged terrain. 
Even as the death toll continues, manufacturers are eliminating their child-size models in favor of heavier and faster ones. Consumer advocates see this as ironic because the industry defeated a move in Congress to ban child-size vehicles, arguing among other things that a ban would merely divert children to larger, more dangerous models.
Youthful drivers of all-terrain vehicles are most often killed when they lose control and the vehicle flips over on them or when they drive on public roads and are hit by other vehicles.
In April 1988, Judge Gerhard A. Gesell of the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia approved a consent decree meant to limit use of these vehicles. The makers and distributors of all-terrain vehicles agreed, among other things, to stop selling three-wheel models, to keep powerful four-wheelers out of youngsters' hands and to provide free driver training.
''No decree designed to protect consumers has ever gone this far in meeting such a massive national consumer problem,'' Judge Gesell said. The decree settled a suit filed by the Consumer Product Safety Commission against the five all-terrain vehicle companies.
But today the safety plan is in disarray. Dealers are not bound by the agreement, and many continue to recommend high-powered vehicles to adults who are buying them for children, according to several studies. And efforts to persuade states to legislate age and license requirements have foundered for the most part.
The agreement was bitterly contested by consumer groups, who said the manufacturers should buy back vehicles that were deemed unsafe. Today these critics say the consent decree is an example of a safety program that pulled its punches and is thus failing to do what it was intended to do.
''We have an extremely hazardous product that has escaped regulation,'' said Dr. Jeanine Jagger, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Virginia Medical School who advocates stricter laws on these vehicles.
 
Injuries Drop; Deaths Constant
Some regulators and industry spokesmen disagree. They say that the decree publicized the hazards of the vehicles and that injuries are falling in response. Proponents of the plan say the continuing deaths are a result of a lack of parental supervision and of tough state laws. Officials of the Commission say they cannot explain why injuries are falling, while deaths appear constant.
The controversy over all-terrain vehicles reaches back to the early 1980's when rising death and injury tolls led consumer and medical groups to call for Government action; Government statistics showed that deaths were highest among children 13 to 15 years old.
In December 1986 the Consumer Product Safety Commission voted to sue all five all-terrain vehicle companies: Honda, Kawasaki, Suzuki, Yamaha and Polaris. The Government demanded that the companies offer refunds, post safety warnings in sales rooms and offer free driver training.
''Our feeling was that these products were dangerous and had been misrepresented as safe,'' said Anne Graham, a commissioner.
But the demand for refunds was abandoned and a complex settlement negotiated. Along with agreeing to end sales of three-wheelers, the industry said it would prevent dealers from selling adult-size vehicles - those with engines bigger than 90 cubic centimeters - for use by youngsters under 16.
Four studies, including an undercover inquiry by the Commission, have all shown that many of the nation's 5,000 all-terrain vehicle dealers are still suggesting that adults buy large vehicles for children under 16.
Many dealers say the reports are wrong. ''Every dealer I know abides by the rules,'' said Hy Weitzman, executive director of the California Motorcycle Dealers Association, a trade group in San Bernardino, Calif.
Recent interviews with distributors show that to date only two dealers nationwide, both Suzuki outlets, have faced any disciplinary action by the companies for recommending large vehicles for children. Suzuki dropped one dealer and placed the other on probation, said John Walsh, legal affairs manager for American Suzuki Motor Corporation in Brea, Calif.
While more than 30 states have passed some laws affecting use of these vehicles, only a handful require licensing or have set 16 as a minimum age for operators of adult-sized machines, according to data complied by the Specialty Vehicle Institute of America, a trade group. Opposition to such laws has come from both dealers and enthusiasts. In Wisconsin a law to make 16 the minimum age for operating adult-size machines is opposed by the Wisconsin All-Terrain Vehicle Association, a user group. ''I see the age limit as artificial and totally unnecessary,'' said James Baxter, the group's executive director.
Enthusiasts like Mr. Baxter said they think many youngsters under 16 are big enough to use adult-size machines properly, and can be easily trained to handle them safely.
Proponents of tougher state legislation feel frustrated by such opposition. ''There are a lot of parents who think that nothing bad is going to happen to my child,'' said Bonnie Sumner of Milwaukee, whose son was badly injured in an accident involving an all-terrain vehicle in 1984.
 
Number of Machines Declines
Though only 11 percent of buyers of all-terrain vehicles nationwide are taking driver training programs, the rate is over 50 percent in a few states, among them Colorado and Minnesota. The number of the vehicles reached a record 2.6 million last year, but declined to 2.4 million this year. If it continues to dwindle, childhood deaths are expected to do so as well.
But the pace of that decline, some fear, may be slowed by another trend - the increasing power of ATV's. These days only one manufacturer, Suzuki, produces an all-terrain vehicle deemed suitable for children under 16. Meanwhile, producers have been souping up their products, statistics suggest. For example, while roughly half the all-terrain vehicle models on the market in 1986 had engine displacements greater than 200 cubic centimeters, that number had increased to some 70 percent by 1988, said Gregory Rodgers, an economist for the Commission.
Some child-size vehicles remain in stock, but as they are sold even enthusiasts like Mr. Baxter have little doubt about the hazards posed to children by the faster machines. ''It does mean that young people who do come into the sport could be exposed to greater risk,'' he said.

SOUTHERN COMFORT The Garden District of New Orleans, 1800-1900.
By S. Frederick Starr.
Photographs by Robert S. Brantley. 308 pp. Cambridge, Mass.: The MIT Press. $35.
NEW ORLEANS is famous for jazz, Cajun and Creole food, Mardi Gras and the French Quarter. Rediscovered by Americans in recent years, it has become an increasingly popular setting for television shows and motion pictures, and its reputation for decadence and sensuality has earned it the nickname of ''the Big Easy.'' 
One of New Orleans's leading tourist attractions, however, has nothing to do with either its proverbial licentiousness or its colonial past - it is an uptown neighborhood, composed largely of 19th-century homes, known simply as the Garden District, and it is the subject of ''Southern Comfort: The Garden District of New Orleans, 1800-1900,'' S. Frederick Starr's beautifully illustrated, highly readable book.
Tourists can be seen strolling through the Garden District at any time of the year, in winter chill or sweltering summer heat, guidebooks in hand, pausing to inspect the various Greek Revival and Italianate houses. Century-old oaks shade the streets; sidewalks are often made of brick or flagstone; there are numerous wrought-iron fences. All summer long - in the patches of random sunlight - waxen-barked crape myrtles add their airy blossoms of red, purple, pink or white to a landscape already dotted with magnolias.
Many of the town houses are immense, sometimes completely filling their narrow lots. Greek-columned porches abound, as do intricate cast-iron railings. Smaller cottages add to the harmony of the whole, with their shuttered floor-length windows and gingerbread ornamentation. Lost in this part of town, you could easily imagine that you have left the modern world. The very scale of the dwellings, with their 14- and 15-foot ceilings, gives them an otherworldly quality.
These ingredients - gnarled branches, drowsy heat, crowded gardens with Corinthian capitals rising behind them - combine to create an ambiance unrivaled anywhere else in the United States. There is a spell at work in the Garden District that embraces the dilapidated old house as well as the splendid restoration; the workingman's double (two-family) cottage and the towering Italianate villa. On certain evenings the sky turns violet beyond the trees, then fades slowly into a pure and incandescent gold. The song of the cicadas, the random cry of birds, the leafy canopy overhead suggest an enchanted woodland rather than a big-city neighborhood.
The visitor cannot help wondering how such a place has survived, or how it ever came to be. ''Southern Comfort'' has the answers. It is a multifaceted study of the Garden District from its inception in the early 1800's until the end of the 19th century. In an economical and enjoyable style, Mr. Starr, the president of Oberlin College in Ohio, who spent two years as the scholar in residence at the Historic New Orleans Collection, discusses the entrepreneurs who settled the neighborhood, the fortunes they made - in cotton, wholesaling and the like - and the architects and builders they hired to create their often ostentatious mansions. Building materials, interior furnishings and ornament, the servant population and the social life of the neighborhood are all considered. Fully footnoted, the book is a valuable contribution to Southern history and to the history of both American architecture and American cities.
Mr. Starr shows how this most Southern of places was a neighborhood of newly arrived self-made millionaires as opposed to Louisiana-born planter aristocrats. The Garden District houses, mostly designed by non-native architects such as Henry Howard and Lewis E. Reynolds, were built in large part by Irish and German immigrant labor. Standing ''at the threshold between the ancient handcraft tradition and modern industrialization,'' in Mr. Starr's words, the Garden District used slate from Wales for its roofs, flagstones from England and Germany for its sidewalks and garden paths, standardized marble mantels and mass-produced ironwork. French cylinder glass went into its windows.
Though slaves lived and worked in the Garden District, its opulent standard of living was not dependent on the slave economy. Some residents owned no slaves; Irish domestics were common. Occupied by the enemy early during the Civil War, New Orleans and the Garden District survived intact. And in the critical years that followed, Mr. Starr says, ''the rural economy of the lower Mississippi Valley was bled not by Yankee loan sharks directly but by New Orleans bankers and factors domiciled in the Garden District.''
In sum, the history of the Garden District is an American tale. Continuing cycles of boom and bust had their impact as freshly minted millionaires went broke within a few years of erecting the homes that advertised their affluence. Before the end of the century the Greek Revival and Italianate styles had given way to the Queen Anne Victorian style.
It may surprise some readers to learn that the depressed modern economy of New Orleans has been partly responsible for the survival of most of the Garden District. In more progressive, prosperous places, old houses were razed by the thousands to make way for more profitable development, and indeed, as Mr. Starr points out, the oil boom of the 1970's saw enormous destruction in New Orleans as well.
But what Mr. Starr fails to mention is that the 1970's also brought about a national interest in restoring old urban homes. Hundreds of thousands of urban pioneers in San Francisco, Boston, Philadelphia and other cities moved back into the neighborhoods bordering downtown to reclaim the beautiful structures that had fallen into neglect. Preservationists organized themselves; restoration and refurbishing became big business. The prices of vintage houses skyrocketed. New Orleans was no exception to the national trend. This spirit has survived the end of the oil boom, and New Orleans is now militantly protective of its splendid old homes. Mr. Starr's statement that ''there have recently been a few signs that further demolition in the Garden District may finally have been checked'' does not do justice to the present state of the preservationist movement.
''Southern Comfort'' can also be faulted for not doing justice to the esthetic quality of the Garden District and its overwhelming effect upon visitors as well as residents. Mr. Starr's constant comparative observations and some of his criticisms - that only two architects working in the Garden District ''exhibited a measure of genuine originality''; and that, in the 1870's, New Orleans failed to develop an authentic regional style - seem curiously cold, if not sour. His overall tone is rather cool, and though his many negative sentiments may be accurate and historically interesting, his lack of apparent enthusiasm for the marvelous end product of grand design, accident, boom and misfortune is a bit confusing.
After all, it is possible that innovation and originality are beside the point in the Garden District. For no matter how similar its houses may be to others in Charleston or the rural Carolinas, or anyplace else, the enclave as a whole is like no other. That it has endured in the heart of a busy city, just minutes from downtown high-rises, only adds to its mystery.
Surely some analysis or discussion of the neighborhood's undeniable beauty and romance would have broadened the scope of the work, and should not be seen as inimical to sound scholarship. Perhaps in seeking to avoid ''moonlight and magnolia'' superlatives, Mr. Starr has gone a little too far in the other direction.
Be that as it may, ''Southern Comfort'' is a landmark piece of scholarship on the area. Its numerous photographs, maps, architectural plans and other illustrations bring together an amazing amount of significant material. In addition to placing the Garden District in national and historical context, Mr. Starr has done a wonderful job of describing, analyzing and documenting the various elements that went into the creation of this remarkable neighborhood.

HEADLINE: Gone Fishing On the Bridges of Florida

BYLINE: By HENRY LEIFERMANN; HENRY LEIFERMANN is a writer who lives in Florida.

 BODY:
IT'S another easy morning on Little Jim Bridge in Florida's Indian River country, the sun just beginning to warm the backs of the regulars fishing from the catwalks and debating, again, how best to hook the noble snapper.
Just across the mangrove flats, shiny charter fishing boats are running out Fort Pierce Inlet, their captains and clients bound for the open Atlantic Ocean to pursue, more or less, the same fish swimming under the bridge. Similar scenes are happening daily, and frequently nightly, in Florida on bridges all along the Atlantic coast, the Gulf of Mexico coast and in the Keys.
By sunset on Little Jim and other coastal bridges, a socially structured and gregariously seasoned gumbo of old-time and first-time anglers will have come and gone from the fishing catwalks. They take with them a taste of, and perhaps a catch from, one of the most popular and least publicized forms of saltwater fishing - and of simple fun - bridge fishing. 
Bridge fishing is easy and inexpensive. Simply park nearby and walk onto the catwalks separated by guardrails from the bridge traffic. There is no need for a boat, a guide, much fishing gear or a license. The coastal bridges are inviting for their scenic views, so take folding chairs and a cooler of drinks and snacks, because bridge fishing frequently and invitingly has nothing to do with fishing.
Travelers and residents, regulars and rookies, retirees and children from every social, economic, ethnic and racial group living in or visiting Florida go bridge fishing. They line the catwalks and take in the parade of small boats, or the sunset, from the Honeymoon Island bridges at Dunedin near Tampa on the Gulf Coast, bridges leading to secluded Honeymoon Island State Park.
They drive cars onto and park along the old Three-Mile Bridge in the western panhandle at the Pensacola Bay town of Gulf Breeze and watch Navy pilots flying from Pensacola Naval Air Station.
In Miami's Biscayne Bay, MacArthur Causeway (U.S. 41) bridges leading to Miami Beach offer closeup views of Caribbean cruise ships plying Government Cut between their docks and the Atlantic Ocean.
Along St. Augustine's Vilano Bridge, spectator-anglers have a vista of passing yachts in the Intracoastal Waterway and miles of saltwater marsh along the Matanzas River.
In the Keys, where sunrises and sunsets are among Forida's most spectacular, bridge fishers pitch tents for shade on both ends of the old Seven Mile Bridge at Marathon.
As Bobbie Miner, owner of the Little Jim Bait & Tackle shop and marina, said: ''A lot of it is not serious fishing. It's social.'' Her store, next to Little Jim Bridge, is on the State Route A1A causeway leading to North Hutchinson Island, crossing the Indian River lagoon from the mainland and Fort Pierce on Florida's south-central Atlantic coast.
Capt. Bill Lomax, a retired commercial fisherman who often works part-time in the store and enjoys people watching, points out parents who have found something different for themselves and their vacationing children to do. ''They bring their kids, the grandchildren, even the neighbor's kids. The kids love it, it costs hardly anything, and I'll tell you what: fishing is still the greatest thing going,'' he said. FROM a bridge, the simply curious or the serious landbound angler gets access to species normally also caught from a boat in the ocean or in saltwater bays. These include tarpon, grouper, snapper, jacks, barracuda and shark, almost every saltwater fish except swordfish, sailfish or tuna, pelagic species that normally spend their entire lives in the open ocean. Most of the bridges lead from the mainland to the many barrier islands and beaches along Florida's coasts. Some cross broad lagoons like the Indian River; others cross inlets, and some are part of the chain of bridges liking the Keys.
Although most of the bridges are not directly on the ocean or the gulf, the waters they span are dominated by one or the other, which makes coastal bridge fishing saltwater fishing.
If the bridge is meant for fishing, it will have catwalks along one or both sides, usually about 25 feet above water at the level of the roadway. If the bridge is not meant for fishing, it will be posted ''No Fishing From Bridge,'' a sign to look for or ask about since some bridges are closed to fishing even though they still retain old fishing catwalks.
Florida imposed its first saltwater fishing license this year ($30 a year for nonresidents), but fishing from a bridge, a pier or the ocean shore is exempt from the license requirement.
All the best coastal fishing bridges have a version of the Little Jim Bait & Tackle shack nearby - for sandwiches, snacks, drinks, gossip and lore and for fishing advice for beginners, such as the fact that you don't need fishing gear of your own to enjoy bridge fishing.
Mrs. Miner recommends buying a ''yo-yo,'' a big, plastic arm bracelet with curved edges to hold fishing line like thread on a spool. Tie on a hook, sinker and bait (the store that sells it will show you how), then whirl the line overhead and sling it out and down into the water. About $20 buys the entire rig.
There is no predicting what you will catch, and usually a regular fishing nearby can identify it for you. Bear in mind that you might catch nothing but a good time, which is why they call it fishing, not catching.
Mrs. Miner's store, and Little Jim Bridge itself, are classics of the genre. Inside the store are boxes of lures and hooks, spools of line, stacks of weights and floats, a freezer of bait, a cooler of beer and T-shirts and baseball caps with the legend ''Little Jim Bait & Tackle.''
Outside, under a sloping roof, is the veranda, with a view of Little Jim Bridge a long cast away. The shady hangout is furnished with items salvaged over the years, such as picnic tables covered with old carpeting and swivel chairs, whose vinyl cushions are cracked and split but are as comfortable as a favorite rocker.
Mrs. Miner has run her place for only 10 years. The bridge, first in wood, later in concrete, has been there since 1926, and some of the regulars have been fishing from it nearly that long, since childhood.
Some of the regulars are self-proclaimed Florida Crackers, old-timers who look askance at the newcomers who live in high-rise condominiums on the nearby beach. Okeechobee Red, Bailey Quattlebaum and Lake Erie Earl are among the regulars.
Captain Lomax said, ''You can't tell who's a local anymore. People spend six months here and six months up North. But if you see a guy fishing with the reel upside down, you know he's from New Jersey or Boston.''
Upside-down fishing, he explained, is with the rod held so that the reel is on top, along with the eyelets through which the fishing line passes. The captain merely shakes his head at the Northerners who get their share of fish despite going about it all wrong.
Motorists visiting Florida might wonder, as they drive over a fishing bridge, just why anyone would want to fish from a bridge. The answers are, for one, because that's where the fish are, and for another, no, it is not dangerous.
Bridge fishermen need to take care not to rear back and cast a rig of snook hooks and lead weights that might snare a passing convertible behind them. They should also resist climbing over the catwalk rail and entering the traffic lanes to reel in a catch.
There are signs on bridges that open for boats. The ''No Fishing Between Signs'' warnings at either end of the draw spans are not to protect anglers who might be too preoccupied to get off when the span is going up. The warnings are to prevent the shouting contests that can occur when a boat passes under the bridge, snagging hooks and lines in the process.
Any bait or tackle shop along Florida's coasts can direct visitors to the nearest fishing bridge. The best bridges have a strong tidal flow beneath them, such as those near inlets to the Atlantic or the gulf and those near the mouth of bays and rivers. There are scores of good coastal fishing bridges, too many to list, among the hundreds of bridges along Florida's coasts.
In the Keys, bridge fishing is a virtual art form and way of life because there are so many bridges, so little beach for surf casting and such spectacular scenery. This year the state Department of Transportation began turning over many old Keys bridges they have replaced with new ones to other state and local agencies for use as fishing bridges.
The old Seven-Mile Bridge is among the most popular. David Krug, a Marathon resident and supervisor in the Keys for the highway department, also recommended the bridges on either side of Craig Key, which is south of Key Largo and north of Marathon.
Those bridges, called Channel Two and Channel Five, Mr. Krug said, ''are probably the two best fishing bridges in the Keys. You can walk the whole length of them on the catwalks. On Channel Two, get there early before the shrimpers.''
In the Lower Keys, the Kemp Channel Bridge at Summerland Key and the Spanish Harbor Bridge at Bahia Honda State Recreation Area are designated as fishing bridges. In the Upper Keys, try the Card Sound Bridge (State Road 997 to Key Largo from the mainland) and visit Alabama Jack's, an open-air restaurant and gossip shop.
As improbable as it may seem, people do catch shrimp as well as fish from the coastal bridges. Shrimp spawn year round in Florida, but the best spawning runs, and therefore the best shrimping times, are from January through March, especially after a cold snap. Veterans recommend shrimping at night, three days before or after a full moon, on an incoming or outgoing tide.
Hang a lantern or some other light above the water. The light attracts the shrimp drifting by on the tide, and the shrimper simply dips them out of the water with a fine-meshed, long-handled net available in most fishing tackle shops.
The light and the shrimp also attract fish, and anglers can pick up a bonus catch by tossing out a bottom rig just beyond the lighted area. For bait, try a fresh shrimp. There is almost as much advice available for beginning fishermen as there is - potentially - fish to catch. A generally accepted recommendation is to have your bait, tackle, chairs and coolers on the bridge and ready to fish a half hour before the tide starts to change.
There are four tides a day, two lows and two highs, each lasting six hours. Experts like Jerry Metz, an Indian River guide based at Little Jim Bait & Tackle, said it is best to fish the first two hours of the outgoing (low) tide through the last hour of the incoming (high) tide. Peak feeding and fishing occurs on the tide change, he said. Nearly everyone recommends using live bait (shrimp, mullet, pigfish, pinfish, goggle-eyes or whatever the regulars use). Generally, that is whatever small baitfish they can catch or buy.
More experienced bridge fishermen recommend taking two rods for this kind of fishing, one light enough to be sporting on the mostly small species that make up the bulk of the catch (rigged with 10-pound line, for example) and the other heavy enough to lift a large, struggling fish 10 to 15 feet into the air (20-pound line).
The veterans often take with them personalized fish-landing systems like a long-handled net. They also avoid leaders with snap-fasteners for attaching the hook, because the device frequently straightens out and releases the hook under the stress of reeling a thrashing fish up to the bridge.
There are potential hazards for fishing lines around a bridge. Barnacles, coral and shellfish as well as rough pilings can slice a line. Some veterans recommend using a six-foot section of heavy leader line.
If you let it, bridge fishing, like any other type of fishing, can overwhelm you or delight you with the available gimcrack gewgaws and do's or don't's lying in wait as bait for beginners. It requires no skill beyond congenialty and conversation, with a taste for the scenic in nature and the individual in people, to savor the best that bridge fishing has to offer.

HEADLINE: Talking: Appraisals;
Lenders Becoming Warier

BYLINE: By ANDREE BROOKS

 BODY:
IN the last few months a growing number of appraisals being made by lenders are falling short of the price agreed upon by buyer and seller.
Say, for example, the buyer and seller decide that $180,000 is a fair price for a home and they sign a contract to that effect. In the past the lenders tended to go along with that decision. But not anymore. Lenders are increasingly likely to decide that such a property is probably worth, say, $160,000. 
''Many of our appraisals are coming in about 5 to 15 percent lower than the purchase price,'' noted Walter Henderson, first senior vice president of Mechanics and Farmers Savings Banks, which has headquarters in Bridgeport, Conn.
The upshot is that the lender will probably not allow the borrower as much financing as had originally been anticipated. But that does not mean the deal will fall through. There are ways around such a problem.
First, it may be worth knowing that the phenomenon is so widespread that rushing to another lender is probably not effective, although it occasionally helps. Low lender appraisals are occurring as a direct result of the national savings and loan crisis, which has led to stricter monitoring by authorities of banking practices. Most lender are thus more nervous and, therefore, more cautious.
The extreme conservatism is being exacerbated by rapidly deteriorating real estate values, especially in the Northeast. Thus, by the time a home closes 30 to 90 days after the appraisal, it may be worth even less, ''so we have to factor in the possibility that the price could drop even lower,'' said Bernard Goodman, a partner in Goodman Marks Associates of Mineola, L.I., which regularly handles appraisals for Long Island lenders.
In other instances the buyers may have been fully aware they were paying slightly more than market value but ''were probably willing to do so,'' said Mr. Goodman, ''because they were anxious to get a certain amenity like a particular school district.'' Lenders did not used to care too much because values would soon catch up; today it it just the opposite.
Yet another reason for low appraisals is that lenders are becoming increasingly uneasy about the economy. ''They worry that borrowers may have difficulty meeting payments if personal income is affected,'' said Mr. Goodman. Should that occur and the property ends up being foreclosed, the lender wants to be certain that at least the size of the outstanding mortgage loan can be recouped. Thus, a mortgage being written for 80 percent or more when values are dropping can be dangerous if market value has not been very conservatively established in advance.
So far only about 10 percent of lender appraisals are falling short of the contract price. ''It would be much higher,'' said Edwin Haflich, a partner in Haflich, Timpanelli & Zeidel, an appraiser in Trubull, Conn., that regularly does work for banks, ''except that in the past few months only the sellers who were willing to make really good deals were finding buyers.''
The properties most frequently affected are condominiums, according to Mr. Henderson, the Connecticut banker, because prices have been weakening most rapidly in this area of the marketplace.
According to Mr. Haflich, low appraisals may also cause some nasty surprises for sellers being relocated by a corporation. When unable to sell their homes, such employees are usually offered the chance to unload them to a relocation home purchase agency, such as Homequity. The custom in these situations is for the employee to get the average of two separate, independent appraisals. But both appraisals may come in far lower than anticipated, he said, ''because we have to assume that house will not sell on the open market for three months or more. And who knows what the value will be then?''
A BUYER who finds that the lender has decided a home is worth less than the contract price can also try to renegotiate with the seller. ''We have seen quite a few instances where the buyer was able to negotiate a lower price,'' said Clark Halstead, managing partner of the Halstead Property Company of Manhattan. In a soft market, sellers are likely to be flexible, he maintained, because they know they might face the problem with another buyer. They may also be under time pressure to sell.
The buyer can try to persuade the lender to change his decision by presenting facts that support the contract price. ''You or your broker should request a copy of the data on which the bank made its decision,'' said Peter Helie, chief operating officer at William Pitt Residential Real Estate of Southern Connecticut. ''And then try to come up with figures that justify what you are paying.''
If no broker is used, an appraiser can be hired to compile an independent set of figures. Expect to pay around $300 for such a service. Sometimes, it can be done at no cost.
Roberta Faulstick, vice president of sales and marketing at William B. May Company of New York City, recalls an instance last summer where a buyer agreed to the full asking price of $750,000 for a Park Slope brownstone. The lender's appraiser said it was worth only $700,000, which meant the loan being requested would exceed 80 percent of value, which the lender would not permit.
''So we asked the bank to get a second appraisal,'' said Ms. Faulstick, ''and offered to pay if it came in at the same price or lower.'' It did not. The second figure was $725,000, enough, she said, to keep the loan under 80 percent of value.
Another alternative is for the buyer to make a larger down payment, a solution chosen by Paul and Susan Stafford of Fairfield Conn. The appraisal for the three-bedroom home they were buying came in at $9,000 less than the contract price. This resulted in the lender's asking for $3,000 more towards the down payment so the loan would not exeed prudent limits.
To lower the size of that loan by lowering the contract prce was not feasible, said Mr. Stafford, because, ''with only two weeks to go to the closing we didn't want to start renegotiating. It would have cost up extra time, which would have been worse.'' So the couple chose instead to pay the additional sum out of cash reserves.
Finally, if the buyer is not borrowing to the limit of his available credit, the difference required by the bank might also be made up through seller financing, said Ms. Faulstick. For example, say there was a $15,000 difference between the contract price and the lender's appraisal. The seller might offer a personal loan for the extra amount the lender is requesting.

HEADLINE: Czech Couple Keep Eye on Homeland

BYLINE: By ROBERTA HERSHENSON

DATELINE: BRIARCLIFF MANOR

 BODY:
AS history is made in Prague, an American couple with strong ties to Czechoslovakia have watched the events on television in their home here. Milena Jelinek, an assistant professor in the film division of the Columbia University School of the Arts, personally knew many players in the current drama before coming to the United States in 1960.
Frederick Jelinek, who left Prague as a teen-ager in 1949, had returned often with his wife to visit her family (his own family is now scattered, with no one left in Czechoslovakia). He was also there twice in the 1970's as an invited lecturer at the Institute for Information Theory and Automatization of the Czechoslovakian Academy of Sciences in Prague. Dr. Jelinek, who holds a doctoral degree in information theory from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, heads I.B.M.'s speech-recognition research team at its Yorktown Heights headquarters.
The team has developed a voice-activated word processor that translates speech into type. 
The Jelineks were introduced in Prague by the Czech film director, Milos Forman at the 1957 premiere of ''Easy Life,'' a film shown throughout Czechoslovakia for which Mrs. Jelinek - then a student named Milena Tobolova - had written the screenplay. She and Mr. Forman were colleagues at Prague's Film and Television School of the Academy of Musical Arts. Dr. Jelinek - who had known Mr. Forman from childhood - was on a visit to Prague.
For the next three years, Dr. Jelinek tried to get the woman he wanted to marry out of Czechoslovakia. In 1960 he succeeded - through the combined efforts of Jerome Wiesner, a former president of M.I.T. and President Kennedy's science adviser; and the Cleveland industrialist Cyrus Eaton, who had influence with Nikita Khruschev; and finally, Mr. Khruschev himself.
This illustrious exit was preceded by a period spent as a ''non-person,'' Mrs. Jelinek said. When the Government learned she wanted to leave, she was suspended from film school and dismissed from her job. But because she left legally, she was able subsequently to visit her parents - who have recently died - and her sister's family and to keep in touch with the country's mood.
The couple said they were surprised, however, over the tumultuous events of the last six weeks. During this time the hard-line Communist President Gustav Husak resigned, the Communist monopoly was dissolved and the dissident playwright Vaclav Havel - whom Mrs. Jelinek knew as a student - was agreed upon as the new President by both the Communist Party and the opposition Civic Forum.
The Jelineks had last been in Czechoslovakia in June, when Mrs. Jelinek addressed an international congress of film students. The Czech students had avoided her then, responding, she concluded, to the usual fear tactics of the Communist regime aimed at keeping the Czech population and foreigners apart.
''I wouldn't have suspected that the mood in three months would be this open revolt,'' Mrs. Jelinek said in a recent conversation with the couple in their living room. Their children, Hannah and William, now in their 20's, grew up in the house, with its wooded setting. Graphics by Czech artists who are friends of the couple line the walls.
Dr. Jelinek agreed that there had been ''no revolutionary mood'' last spring, despite certain hints at change. A songwriter named Jiri Suchy, who had written songs for Mrs. Jelinek's films but hadn't been allowed to perform on television since 1968, was appearing in a Prague theater. A petition circulated by a group of artists requesting a more responsive Government had been signed by thousands.
Dr. Jelinek described a system within the Communist system that still flourished in June. Based on what he called ''ingenious barter,'' it consisted of ''everybody helping everybody else'' and ''making deals'' to have a comfortable life.
 
A 'Niceness' Has Grown
''Everything you get has to be a favor from someone,'' Dr. Jelinek said. As a result, he noted, a certain ''niceness'' almost as a philosophy, has grown up under the regime.
''Being nice to each other became the way to survive, to continue having the Czech nation'' in the face of Russian domination,'' Dr. Jelinek said.
On the other hand, an extreme case of materialism grips the nation, he said. ''There is no more materialistic society than a socialist society,'' he added. ''That's all they do, all they think about. The whole family works all the time just to have a car.''
The coin's other side is ''you simply don't have things that you somehow imagine would make a difference,'' his wife said.
Mrs. Jelinek said she did not believe, however, that a desire for ''things'' had fueled the revolution. ''They are demonstrating in the streets because they are not going to allow the Soviet Union to take responsiblity for their lives anymore,'' she said. ''You will exchange social security for responsibility over your own life.''
 
Watches TV for Changes
In 1956 the screenwriter herself protested in the street, but she said she had ''left too soon'' to be among the group of compatriots from the Prague Spring era of 1968 now celebrating in Czechoslovakia. She did not keep in touch with the many artists she knew in Prague, for fear of endangering them. She now watches television to learn of the changes for which she once marched.
''You see these flags and hear these songs and you thought it would never happen,'' Mrs. Jelinek said of the general strike and demonstrations in late November that led to the recent developments. ''Of course, I wanted to see every shot and every face on TV.'' Yet despite the emotional pull to be there and the expense of long telephone calls to family in Czechoslovakia, neither Jelinek is catching the next plane to Prague. While many Czech intellectuals living abroad have been called to return, they have not been asked.
Dr. Jelinek said that he is unknown in the country, having left so long ago. Despite the reputation he has gained on the international lecture circuit, people from his field in Czechoslovakia were ''never allowed to go to our conferences,'' he said.
His situation is unusual because in exchange for a two-year scholarship to M.I.T. from the Mid-European Study Center, a division of the now disbanded Committee for a Free Europe, Dr. Jelinek had agreed to use his education for the benefit of Czechoslovakia if the country ever became free.
Now he is not needed, he said. Besides, he added that he ''wouldn't quit I.B.M.''
Mrs. Jelinek maintained that Czechoslovakia has ''plenty of people who teach film'' and that her presence wasn't necessary. The company spoke of Mr. Forman, now famous for such films as ''Amadeus'' - as well as another Columbia professor, the director Vojta Jasny, who were returning to Prague and being ''welcomed at the airport.'' It was a matter of when you left and with whom you shared struggles, the couple they agreed.
At Columbia, however, Mrs. Jelinek has helped the Czech cause in several ways. She organized a telegram of support to be sent from Columbia film students to the students at her former school in Prague, who, she said, were ''at the center'' of the November strike.
She said she is also in touch with ''various organizations'' requesting aid - such as cameras and videotapes for film students, whose strike has extended through recent weeks. The Columbia film division has had a strong Czech component for many years. Faculty members in addition to Mrs. Jelinek and Mr. Jasny have included Mr. Forman, who is on leave as co-chairman of the division; the Czech Frank Daniel, a former co-chairman and now dean of the film school at the University of Southern California.
The Jelineks said they were optimistic about Czechoslovakia's future, despite what Dr. Jelinek said would be ''enormous economic problems.''
''No one knows how to make the transition,'' from Communism to a market economy which is ''what the people want,'' he said. ''No one wants to have capitalism, but I think you can't have a market economy without capitalism,'' he added.
Observing that capitalism is ''the final aim,'' he said he didn't know how it could be achieved.
''I think it's extremely important not to antagonize the workers,'' Dr. Jelinek added. In their visit last spring to the Czech countryside, the couple said they had found that many farmers did not want change. ''The fact is, agriculture is really quite all right,'' Mrs. Jelinek said. ''The cooperatives are bringing profits back to the people.''
Over the years, Dr. Jelinek has had several run-ins with border police as he was leaving Czechoslovakia. Once he was arrested and interrogated - although quickly released - while taking pictures of the unmarked barracks at the concentration camp where his father, a dentist, died of typhoid during World War II.
Now, looking toward continued reform, he pointed out that ''the army is still run by Communists.''
''The question is who has the arms,'' his wife said. ''You have to have the army on your side and you have to know what to do with the secret police. You have to know you won't be occupied by the Soviets. The Soviet tanks are still on the territory.'' She recalled Mr. Havel, as she knew him 30 years ago.
''He was a member of a small circle of artists,'' Mrs. Jelinek said. ''He was always very shy. Everyone knew his uncle was the owner of a film company.''
''He comes from rich people and a bourgeois background,'' said Dr. Jelinek of Mr. Havel, who spent four months in prison this year for subversion. Most of the dissidents were Communists at one time,'' he added. ''Havel never was.''

HEADLINE: ARCHITECTURE/DESIGN
ARCHITECTURE VIEW; From Friend to Mysterious Alien Force in 40 Years

BYLINE: By Thomas Hine; Thomas Hine is the author of ''Populuxe,'' published by Knopf, about design in the 1950's. He is working on a book about imagining the future.

 BODY:
Things from the late 1940's are suddenly quite interesting, not because baby boomers are nostalgic for a moment that was just before their time but because, as eras end, it is natural to look back at their origins and think about some of the roads not taken.
As the postwar era ends its nearly 45-year run, it is time for a look at Eames chairs, Quonset huts, be-bop, action painting, Alexander Calder's improvised kitchen utensils, Raymond Loewy's 1947 Studebaker and Mary Martin singing in the shower.
All of these are phenomena that represent, in some way, a fresh spirit that was prevalent in the United States just as the postwar era was beginning. But their attitude of innovative materialism has been missing from our culture for some time.
Several of them are addressed or at least alluded to by recent exhibitions and books, including the shows ''Blueprints for Modern Living'' at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles and ''The Intimate World of Alexander Calder,'' at the Cooper-Hewitt, each of which has an accompanying catalogue, and the book ''Eames Design,'' published by Abrams. 
Postwar America is famous for its prodigious but careless consumption of things. We now have more cars registered than there are licensed drivers, occupy more than twice as much developed space per person than we did in 1945, and lay down landfills that rival the great pyramid at Giza.
Today we build classical porticoes out of plastic foams that can be pierced with a butter knife, showing that we value the image more than the substance. The Seabees with their 50-gallon oil drums, Alexander Calder with his wire, Charles and Ray Eames with their plywood, Jackson Pollock with his paint - all were far more interested than we in the things themselves. They played with things and found new possibilities in them. Yet theirs promised to be a materialism that stopped short of the idolatry implicit in prewar European modernism. The war had been a reminder that materials and technology were, above all, useful. They had no meaning by themselves, but could serve as tools to build and protect a way of life. God did not reside, blasphemously, in the details, but rather in the inspiration that made these things into expressions of life and its infinite possibilities.
The saving grace was probably a faith in the possibilities of improvisation, not just in painting and jazz but even in architecture and design. While Calder had been putting found materials to both practical and artistic uses for decades, the principal impetus for the improvisatory spirit was the war, which had imposed stern disciplines on budgets and materials. The architect Bruce Goff, serving in a naval construction battalion, used string and an electric fan blowing on balloons to create a club on a naval base. Even after the war was over, he kept on using Quonset huts, bending their barrel-vault structures to make houses that were new and entirely unexpected.
But the improvisatory spirit was widespread and shared by people who would never design anything again. Certain expedients became standard procedures. For example, it is likely that the shower under which a real-life Nellie Forbush (from the musical ''South Pacific'') would have washed that man right out of her hair would have been fashioned from oil drums, modified to catch rainwater and be heated by the sun, a primitive solar hot-water system. (It's also likely that her fellow nurses would have told her to stop using all the hot water, rather than joining in the chorus, but then again, nobody ever left a show humming the plumbing.) The clever G.I. was a motif that ran through countless magazine articles from late 1944 on. Women's magazines promised that returning soldiers would be able to fulfill their wives' and fiancees' deepest fantasies: they'd be able to fix things. But even girls could be handy. In 1946, House Beautiful devoted an article to one Thelma Brunette (a blonde), who had, with the help of her father, turned a double-decker bus into a home, complete with fireplace, on the beach at Malibu.
A few miles away, in Pacific Palisades, Charles and Ray Eames were planning what became a landmark of easygoing technology, their own house. Charles Eames did the first design (with Eero Saarinen) in 1945, but because of materials shortages and other problems, the industrial parts from which it was to be built were not delivered until 1948. With the materials on hand, Eames made them into an entirely different building, actually a pair of buildings, one of the most delightful and celebrated designs of the entire postwar era. It is also one of the most written-about, so there is no need to say much here, except to note that one of its best qualities is that it appears to be an artful expedient rather than an artistic expression. Alone among the celebrated glass-and-steel houses of the immediate postwar era, it did not seem to oppress its occupants. The house does not express the tyranny of what many modernist architects spoke of, in near-religious terms, as The Solution. It is a neutral container that admits life. (In fact, the casualness of the Eameses' living style - the exquisite clutter that made visiting there so memorable - was very carefully maintained. Comparisons of photographs from different times show that things that seemed merely to have been scattered about were allowed to move barely a millimeter from decade to decade.) The Eameses became famous for their plywood-and-metal chairs, which grew out of their war work developing splints for wounded soldiers and drew on wartime advances in wood molding, glues and synthetic rubber for shock mounts. Today their house represents a rare example of a humane materialism that many observers hoped would become widespread as the country shifted from war to peace. This was a matter-of-fact modernism, one that would not celebrate machine technology and materials but simply recognize their enormous usefulness. They had helped win the war and could also lead to an era of prosperous and comfortable peace. It was natural to assume that veterans of mechanized warfare and improvised living would feel at home with the new, as would the many women who spent the war working in factories.
These postwar hopes were mixed with fears that the industrial machinery that had produced the victory would be allowed to slump back into depression. Thus, even before the war ended, Americans were encouraged to aspire to new suburban houses, filled with new appliances, as their reward for wartime sacrifices. We were urged to dream about beating our tanks into bungalows.
It seemed to be a moment for innovation. Buckminster Fuller, who had already been dreaming of inexpensive metal houses in easy-to-build kits for 20 years, had Beech Aircraft as a backer, and even announced that he was ready to take orders. Walter Gropius revived Bauhaus dreams of factory-made housing and helped start factories on both coasts to produce it. There was a sudden proliferation of car makes, including the Tucker, the subject of the 1987 movie. DeFoe Shipbuilders announced a homey, metal Cape Cod house, while Kaiser, who had produced the liberty ships, started making dishwashers, garbage disposals, and that peculiar car, the Henry J. Postwar materials shortages kept many of the most visionary schemes from getting off the ground. And Federal Housing Administration and Veterans Administration mortgage insurance policies discriminated against anything that looked too modern (along with houses that were old or in racially integrated neighborhoods). While Levitt and other developers were able to respond to consumer demand with mass-produced housing, war plants were never converted to produce metal house kits. It's likely that people would not have liked them, and that the modernism the war represented was something they never wanted to see again. But we'll never know, because the military plants never needed to find other products to make. The menace of the Soviet Union under Stalin replaced that of the Axis powers, and soon there was war in Korea.
The production of consumer goods did revive, and a lot of novel products were offered. Many of the appliances of the immediate postwar era look prehistoric today, since they represent evolutionary dead ends on the way to material goods that have since become inescapable. Television screens resided deep in wooden cabinets, from which they were reflected, dimly, by mirrors, or they were behind enormous magnifying glasses. The Kaiser Fleetways dishwasher was cylindrical, and it popped out of the counter top, like a periscope, for loading. One company, Thor, brought out an appliance that could wash both clothes and dishes, though not at the same time.
Even the Loewy-designed Studebakers, probably the most advanced mass-produced cars of the period, have the awkward look of something new trying to be born. People claimed not to be able to tell which way they were going - largely because these cars offered unprecedented visibility both front and rear. Their look was open at a time when many of their competitors appeared designed for defense.
By the 1950's the visionaries had dropped out of the marketplace and the giant-sloth appliances had become extinct. But more important, goods had become dematerialized. We learned to become attached not to any particular thing but to the practice of buying things. General Electric told us that its product was not stoves or steam irons, but progress itself. As long as G.E. and its counterparts kept working to improve our lives, the rest of us wouldn't have to worry. Each new generation of products would be so great an advance over its predecessors that it would be unnecessary to ask whether the new things were better than the old. Features multiplied. The workaday turned stylish. Blenders, for example, offered the meaningless choice between ''puree'' and ''liquefy.''
This process has continued, and the more ideals we embrace, the more trash we produce. Like dustballs under the bed, objects proliferate beneath such abstractions as comfort, convenience, progress, prestige. Even our weapons were said to advance some abstraction, like credibility, say, rather than accomplish any concrete goal. (The most powerful weapon was, of course, something that could not be used in any rational way, which pushed the cold war toward the conceptual.) Our lives fill up with products that few of us can understand, let alone repair. We tend to view technology as a mysterious alien force, rather than as the sum of our improvisations, the activity that makes us human.
The easy confidence of the immediate postwar world will never be recovered, and the popular modernism it was expected to produce was probably little more than wishful thinking in the first place. Still, it might be possible - even necessary - to be at ease once again with our artifacts. Issues that seem remote from design, including the proliferation of garbage and the difficulty of sustaining an economy that consumes more than it produces, may force Americans to take their materialism seriously again.

Floria Starts With Support, Confidence and Big Problems

BYLINE: By JOSEPH F. SULLIVAN

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
James J. Florio has vowed to be a much different Governor of New Jersey than Thomas H. Kean, in management style if not in his policies. But the discussions of changes he hopes to make in the structure and substance of government are likely to be overshadowed by the slowing economy and a looming fiscal crisis.
The 52-year-old Democratic Representative, who will be sworn in as New Jersey's 49th Governor on Jan. 16, has indicated that he will be a hands-on manager. It would be a marked departure from the style of Governor Kean, who has preferred to delegate authority and lead by persuasion in his eight years in office. In addition, Mr. Florio says he will centralize decision-making, seeking more coordination among cabinet-level officials. 
But while Mr. Florio has discussed his philosophy of management in naming his first six cabinet appointees, he is likely to come into office not as a managerial innovator but in the unpopular role of a budget cutter. For example, recommended pay raises for top state officials will be delayed until 1991 at Mr. Florio's request. After seven years of economic growth, Mr. Kean predicts that his successor will have to raise taxes or cut services in his first year. Mr. Kean faced a similar problem in 1982, his first year in office, and helped enact increases in both the sales and income taxes to close a budget gap.
Mr. Florio's transition team is made up largely of the people who ran his campaign. While there have been few surprises in his appointments thus far, the search is expanding beyond New Jersey. With his landslide victory in November over his Republican opponent, Representative Jim Courter, politicians say that Mr. Florio has few political debts to repay in picking his administration, and Mr. Kean also recruited out of state.
Executive recruiters have been consulted, and a week after the election, Steven P. Perskie, the director of Mr. Florio's transition committee, met with Mayor Edward I. Koch of New York City and Stanley Brezenoff, the First Deputy Mayor, to see if any departing members of the Koch administration might consider moving to New Jersey. ''They were very cooperative, and so far about 40 resumes of some very talented people have been forwarded to us for screening,''
Mr. Perskie said. The candidates could possibly fill jobs from middle management up to cabinet level, he said.
After the initial appointments, the pace of filling the more than 20 cabinet seats and other administration posts has slowed. One reason is Mr. Florio's stipulation that members of his administration be prevented from doing business with the state government for a time after they leave office. The length of this ban and its terms have not been set.
Those who have agreed to serve are regarded by politicians and political scientists as moderate and pragmatic choices. They are Robert J. Del Tufo, a former United States Attorney for New Jersey, who will be Attorney General; Superior Court Judge Judith A. Yaskin, who will become Environmental Commissioner; Scott Weiner, Mr. Florio's campaign treasurer, who will head the Public Utilities Board; Mayor Melvin R. Primus of Camden, who will be Community Services Commissioner; Raymond L. Bramucci, the director of Senator Bill Bradley's New Jersey office, who will be Labor Commissioner, and George R. Zoffinger, executive vice president of the First Fidelity Bank, who will be Commerce Commissioner. In making the appointments, Mr. Florio has emphasized what his staff says is a horizontal rather than vertical view of state government. Instead of a collection of departments operating independently, as many agencies in New Jersey and other state governments do now, Mr. Florio stresses solving problems that cross departmental lines by teams of cabinet-level officials. As an example, Mr. Florio said the first assignment of the new Labor and Commerce Commissioners will be to compress and coordinate some 63 job training programs that have sprung up around the state under various state and Federal programs.
Prof. Stephen A. Salmore of the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University said that Mr. Florio's intial appointees are ''a good blend of politics and competence,'' but he said the Attorney General's appointment was a bit of a surprise. ''Usually a governor appoints a political ally as attorney general because of the sensitivity of the position,'' he said. ''Del Tufo is certainly not an enemy, but neither is he politically identified with Florio.''
Professor Salmore said it is clear that Mr. Florio is ''carefully constructing a team that he is comfortable with.'' But he said the idea of cabinet members working as a team is novel. ''Traditionally, cabinet members end up being turf-conscious,'' he said. ''It's almost inevitable. It will be interesting to see if Florio's idea works.''

For Some, There's No Aid When the Crops Freeze

BYLINE: By JEFFREY SCHMALZ

DATELINE: IMMOKALEE, Fla.

 BODY:
When everything comes together right, when the Florida sun stays warm, Antonio Francisco can pick 90 buckets of tomatoes a day.
At 40 cents a bucket, that means $36. ''It doesn't make me a rich man,'' the 28-year-old Guatemalan immigrant said. ''But I can get along. It's O.K.'' 
But everything has not come together right this year in the agriculture belts of Florida and Texas. Last weekend, for the third time in the 1980's, Florida's vegetable fields and citrus groves were hit by freezing temperatures. The fields around Immokalee and elsewhere in southern Florida that should be ripe with tomatoes and beans and cucumbers and squash are instead a blackened brown.
Mr. Francisco, like thousands of other pickers, has no work. Florida had crop-killing freezes in 1983 and 1985, but has no procedures in place to aid the people who are frozen out of their livelihoods.
In Texas, where officials estimated last week that 60 percent of the Rio Grande Valley citrus crop and 80 percent of the vegetable crop were lost, state agencies and the American Red Cross announced plans to open four relief centers for farm worker families. But like thousands of others in Florida, where private relief efforts were still in the process of being organized, Mr. Francisco has nowhere to turn.
Gov. Bob Martinez declared a disaster in all 67 Florida counties, setting in motion the process that could bring Federal aid. But officials say it will be weeks before they can complete the loss estimates that are a prerequisite for Federal relief. And even then, access to Washington's thinly stretched resources is by no means guaranteed.
Many pickers, in the meantime, are ineligible for unemployment benefits because their employers, in violation of the law, never paid into the unemployment insurance fund on their behalf. Others are illegal immigrants who are leery of approaching officialdom for help and would be ineligible anyway.
Florida, which is usually ranked at or near the bottom of states in terms of social-services spending, offers welfare benefits only for families with children, not for single people like Mr. Francisco. So what will he do?
Like many other pickers, Mr. Francisco will probably go a bit north, to Florida's citrus belt, where growers are frantically hiring as they rush to get their cold-damaged oranges out of the fields and processed into juice before they rot. But the rush in the orange groves will last only four weeks or so, then there will be nothing for two months as everyone waits for the next crop of vegetables to ripen - assuming, that is, that the freezes are over for this season.
Until then, many pickers will simply live in tents or cars or whatever other makeshift shelter they can find. They will eat at soup kitchens, like the one run here by the Roman Catholic church.
''The growers want 5,000 to 10,000 people sitting around waiting for the crops to ripen,'' said Robert Williams, a lawyer for Florida Rural Legal Services, which provides legal aid to farm workers. ''But then when there's an emergency like this, they pretend the farm workers don't even exist.''
No one can say exactly how many of Florida's 200,000 to 250,000 farm workers are illegal immigrants. State officials and farm worker representatives say that roughly 20 percent of the workers are American blacks; 15 to 20 percent are Haitian immigrants, some here legally, some not; about 20 percent are Mexican-Americans, and another 20 percent are Mexicans who are illegal immigrants. The rest are Central Americans, primarily illegal immigrants from Guatemala. Farm worker representatives said the Guatemalans were often willing to work for less than the legal minimum of $3.35 an hour.
State officials and farm worker representatives said that despite tough new Federal laws against hiring illegal immigrants, they could not think of any case in Florida in which a farm owner had been fined for hiring them. Proof that the employer had reason to know that the worker was here illegally is difficult to establish.
''I know of eight Guatemalans in Dade County last month where the grower paid them for the first two weeks, then decided not to pay them for the third week,'' said Gregory Schell, a lawyer for Florida Rural Legal Services. ''He said, 'I know you're illegal.' I told the workers, 'I can get you the money.' They said: 'No. He'll call Immigration.' ''
Florida officials are pressing the Bush Administration to declare a Federal disaster, opening up loans to growers and waiving some conditions for receiving unemployment compensation and making the money available to some farm workers who cannot receive it now. But the Federal Government is reluctant.
Federal officials say that disaster funds are running low because of Hurricane Hugo and the San Francisco earthquake. And they point out that Florida has drawn on disaster aid twice before in this decade for crops lost to cold weather. More and more, Federal officials say, they are coming to believe that freezes in Florida are simply part of an agriculture cycle that growers and workers are going to have to come to grips with.
The extent of crop damage this time is still being assessed, but the human toll in the Tampa area and in Dade County adds up to perhaps 25,000 field hands thrown out of work.
''It's scary to see all these people just standing around this time of year.'' said Mr. Francisco, the tomato picker. ''They got nothing to do but get in trouble.''

In College Sports, The Real Players Collect Millions From The Networks

BYLINE: By JOE LAPOINTE

 BODY:
Jim Brock is executive director of the Cotton Bowl football game, which will pay its competing teams about $3 million each to play in Dallas tomorrow afternoon. The five big bowl games - Cotton, Rose, Orange, Sugar and Fiesta -will pay their 10 teams a total of about $36 million, much of the money coming from television. In total, the 18 post-season bowl games will pay their 36 schools about $60 million this year, Mr. Brock said, up from $53 million a year ago.
Talking about money from bowl games and other big events of college sports, Mr. Brock described one school's athletic director as ''a sharp cookie,'' another as ''a good operator'' and praised several others in similar terms. It sounded as if he were describing wheelers and dealers of big business rather than leaders of amateur sport. 
''It is a big business, no question about it,'' Mr. Brock said of college sports. ''It's getting bigger and bigger and bigger.''
The recent seven-year contract between CBS and the National Collegiate Athletic Association for broadcasting the men's basketball tournament starting in 1991 is for $1 billion. It will increase the tournament's television money from $55 million in 1990 to an average of $143 million a year in the next seven years.
The College Football Association, which represents 66 football schools, is negotiating a new contract to replace one expiring with CBS that now pays the association $16 million a year. The new deal is likely to pay more. The 20 schools of the Big Ten and Pac 10 conferences have a contract with ABC that pays them an average of about $16 million a year for regular-season football games, not including the $12.2 million split between the two teams in the Rose Bowl.
How does this kind of cash change college sports, if at all? Are universities getting rich from the efforts of unsalaried performers? Does this encourage cheating to win? Or does the money support other sports and make intercollegiate athletics accessible for more students in more sports?
It takes money to make money and not everyone shows a profit. Robert Atwell, the president of the American Council on Education, which represents 1,400 college and university presidents, estimates that the nation's colleges spend about $1 billion a year on all sports and take in less than that in revenue from television, tickets and other sources.
But some schools make money. One is Notre Dame, which will earn $4.1 million by playing Colorado tomorrow in the Orange Bowl. The Rev. E. William Beauchamp, the executive vice president of the university, says Notre Dame budgets about $9 million a year to operate 20 intercollegiate sports. ''Football and basketball provide the revenue that supports the rest of your athletics,'' he said. ''Especially football.''
Richard Rosenthal, the Notre Dame athletic director, says the university takes in more from sports than it spends. ''We keep our head above water,'' Mr. Rosenthal said, adding that 80 percent of the school's sports income is generated by football, which spends about 35 percent of the budget. He said about 30 percent of his operating budget comes from television money.
''I don't think the so-called prize money is really the inducement for people to cheat,'' he said. ''The illusion and allegation of abuse coupled to money is a little misplaced. People who would take short cuts to win will do so anyway, with or without money.''
Richard D. Schultz, the executive director of the N.C.A.A., says opinion surveys tell him that the public perception of college athletics is a negative one. Changes are needed, he said, starting with a different way to distribute television money from the basketball tournament. Now, winners get the most.
A wider distribution of the money, or ending the system of putting it only into the winners' pool, would be a big change from the current formula under which a school can earn $274,000 for making the first round of the basketball tournament and $1.37 million for making the Final Four. Mr. Schultz says he will urge changes before the new television contract takes effect in 1991.
 
Needing Control
''Right now, colleges and universities are not perceived as controlling their athletic programs,'' Mr. Schultz said. ''You are what you are perceived to be. We need to re-style some things. Universities need to be in control of their athletic programs, and I'm not so sure they always are.''
Some outside critics tend to have a harsher view. They argue that the only way to reform college sports is to tear down the present structure, declare the games to be professional entertainment and pay the players. An advocate of this approach is Rick Telander, a former football player at Northwestern and a writer for Sports Illustrated magazine whose book, ''The Hundred Yard Lie,'' stirred debate and angry reaction in college football circles when it was published this year. ''An ethical housecleaning would turn the whole chummy system into chaos, even if it ultimately brought integrity to the game,'' he wrote. ''So let's forget about the N.C.A.A. as being anything other than an anchor against progress.''
In a recent interview, he said, ''I know I come off as an extremist. But I'm saying nothing that hasn't been said for 100 years. I don't blame TV. I don't blame the N.C.A.A. But at some point you can't keep exploiting free labor. It reminds me of the pre-union days in mining.''
Mr. Atwell of of the American Council on Education said Mr. Telander's book is ''right.'' But he opposes declaring big-time college sports to be professional. Like Mr. Schultz, he favors a redistribution of money, starting with the basketball tournament and the 290 Division 1 schools that field teams for the sport. ''Take the billion and divide it by 290,'' he said. ''That would send a powerful message. Cut the tie between money and winning. I always say money is the single most important factor in corruption of college athletics. You throw that much money on the table and all sorts of bad things can happen.''
 
Not All Are Rich
Mr. Atwell nevertheless argues that the perception of wealth is incorrect. ''One of the great myths is that colleges are getting rich from sports,'' he said. ''They are not.''
That argument is backed by Chuck Neinas, the executive director of the College Football Association, and Jim Delany, the new commissioner of the Big Ten.
Mr. Neinas noted that since Federal legislation of the 1970's forced colleges to expand women's sports, the athletic departments have had to absorb second athletic programs. These new programs, along with inflation, ''obviously strained the budget,'' he said. For most athletic departments, he continued, ''Gate receipts remain the most important financial element, combined with donations and gifts.''
Mr. Delany said that about 30 to 50 percent of the athletic budgets in his conference are financed by television money. At the same time, he noted, some athletic departments in his conference are in debt.
''They feel if you have a $10 million indoor football-practice facility, I have to have one, too,'' he said.

As Ideology Recedes, The U.S. Rearranges Its Global Struggles

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Viewing American foreign policy these days can seem a bit like watching a badly dubbed and poorly edited foreign movie. The actors often seem to be speaking the wrong lines and their actions often seem to be all out of order.
Consider the last two weeks. One day the United States intervenes in Panama and the next day it virtually invites the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact to invade Rumania to support the democracy movement there. One day the Administration sends two senior officials to Beijing to patch up ties with China, apparently out of concern that the Chinese leadership, if alienated, might rush into an embrace with Moscow, and the next day it invites the Soviet Foreign Minister to visit NATO headquarters. For years the United States railed against the Marxist Sandinista Government in Managua, but it turned out that the threat deemed worthy of an invasion was from a 19th-century-style tinpot dictator in Panama. 
Is there a method to this melange? Actually, yes. The ideological competition between East and West, so prominent in global politics in the last 40 years, is giving way, making what was unimaginable a year ago, such as a visit by Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze to NATO headquarters, almost routine. At the same time, more traditional power politics is becoming more apparent.
In the classic form of power politics, ideologically inspired actions take a back seat to basic territorial and economic imperatives. Dominant powers assert themselves in their own regions or spheres of the world while competing for mastery in areas where there is an opportunity for a contest. This is the real meaning of the Panama invasion, and of Moscow's insistence on keeping Eastern Europe in the Warsaw Pact, even while allowing it to retreat from Communism.
The object of this game of nations is not necessarily a freer world or a workers' paradise, but survival of the fittest and everything this requires: influence, resources and allies.
When the glow over the end of the cold war fades, watch for Washington and Moscow to go on competing for advantage on the Eurasian land mass, just as they have for nearly a half-century. ''The end of the cold war does not mean an end of a global competiton between the superpowers,'' said Michael J. Sandel, a political theorist at Harvard. ''Once the ideological dimension fades, what you are left with is not peace, harmony and sweetness, but old-fashioned global politics based on dominant powers competing for influence and pursuing their national interests.''
But, at least in the view of some critics, it seems that not everyone in the Bush Administration - particularly the President - is alive to the subtleties of this transition and the new opportunities it may be opening. President Bush has never fully explained his decision to send his national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, on two secret missions to China, except to say that for geopolitical reasons he did not want to isolate Beijing by punishing its leadership too harshly for the murders in Tiananmen Square. Some in the Administration argue that such a policy is the essence of ''realist'' power politics.
To the critics, though, it seems a bad imitation. To be sure, it might not be in America's interest to be isolated from China, both because China is the biggest power in Asia and because of the potential for a Moscow-Beijing alliance against Washington. But the question is not whether links between the United States and China should be maintained but on whose terms and, in the wake of Tiananmen Square, with what timing. And with whom should these ties be maintained - with the current aging Chinese leadership or with the next generation of the Chinese people?
Given the changes in Moscow, Beijing's leaders are not in the same pivotal position in the superpower contest that their predecessors enjoyed two decades ago. And given the alienation of today's leaders from their people, their future tenure is questionable. Therefore, the critics argue, catering to the sensibilities of Deng Xiaoping and his colleagues isn't realism, but an anachronism.
''The Scowcroft China mission is a classic case of cultural lag: a President applying 1970's thinking to a 1990 situation,'' said Edward N. Luttwak of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. ''The United States-China relationship in the 1970's was a natural coalescence against a dynamically expansive Soviet Union. With Soviet activism in decline, the importance of the Beijing-Washington strategic relationship declines as well. Certainly Washington need not worry that Beijing will be driven into the arms of Moscow. Today it is the economic relationship that is increasingly important, and in that relationship the United States is the giver and China the taker.''
In addition to traditional power politics, something more is emerging as the ideologically driven East-West competition wanes. Moral concerns like human rights could take on new force, while the environment, terrorism, drugs and above all economics rise as factors in international relations. In the days when power depended on who had the biggest army and navy, it was easy to identify which country was predominant. Today, a country's balance of trade is becoming as important an indicator of its status as its place in the balance of power. In this economically interdependent world, America's place will increasingly depend as much on how it deals with its trade deficit with Japan as on how it coexists with the Soviet Union in Europe.
''In many third world areas, we will find ourselves both competing with and cooperating with the Japanese and not the Soviets,'' Geoffrey Kemp, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment, argued. ''The Russians just are not going to be players. Aside from military equipment, the Soviets have nothing to sell. Not only are they unable to compete with Europe, Japan and the United States, but also with their own former satellites in Eastern Europe - which is naturally going to draw Eastern Europe westward and leave the Soviets with a shrinking pie.''
As long as the world economy continues to expand, there will be room for the United States, Europe and Japan to act in cooperation, Mr. Kemp noted. But, he added, if there is a global recession ''one would be foolish to assume that this will remain the case.''

A Decade Ends, And the Nouvelles Of New York Are Not Invited

BYLINE: By GEORGIA DULLEA

 BODY:
There was a moment in December 1980, when then President-elect Ronald Reagan was kneeling on the floor of Brooke Astor's Park Avenue apartment after one of her important black-tie dinners. He was looking for a diamond earring she had dropped and together they were laughing. It was an oddly glamorous moment, the philanthropist, the President and the lost diamond.
Soon after that there appeared on the New York social scene the first glints of the gilded era of the 80's. This was a lavish spectacle of wealth and the props of wealth fueled by the sort of fast money from Wall Street that made the word millionaire obsolete. Parties were the thing in this era, million-dollar birthday parties for the middle-aged. 
''In my day, a million was a lot,'' said Mrs. Astor, who put the rich-rich on the charity circuit. ''Today, a billion is more like it.''
The pace setters of the decade were a handful of financial wizards and their younger second or third wives. Suddenly they were everywhere - in the flesh and in print. One could turn to the business section and read about the deals they did and the money they made and then, flipping to the gossip columns, read about the showy ways in which they spent the money.
The ubiquitous billionaires and their followers had no official name until the second half of the 80's when John Fairchild, looking up from a table at Le Cirque, christened them Nouvelle Society. He launched the name in his publications, Women's Wear Daily and W. Nouvelle couples became cultural icons and, in time, objects of criticism.
Glossy magazines devoted articles and even cover stories to their enchanted life styles. One could be at home - a Rubens in the drawing room, a Renoir in the bath - with Gayfryd and Saul Steinberg. Or John and Susan Gutfreund, who entertain with four kinds of caviar. Or Henry Kravis and Carolyne Roehm, who eats Oreos for breakfast.
One could travel via magazine for weekends at their country places, smell their flowers and pet their dogs. One could be there for family birthdays and wedding parties at places like the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
 
A $17,000 Cake
In their conspicuous consumption, the Nouvelles were consumed by the public and served up by a press for whom the point of the story increasingly became not how lovely, but how much. The cake for the wedding of Laura Steinberg and Jonathan Tisch reportedly cost $17,000. Ummm, delicious. Taste that money.
Signs that the social spectacle might be souring came in 1986, when Felix and Elizabeth Rohatyn, a couple with social clout, questioned the opulence of charity balls. The biggest balls were run not by the Nouvelles, but by Old Guard figures like Mrs. Astor, Pat Buckley and Annette Reed.
Yet the Nouvelles, with their big-money connections, were selling $100,000 worth of tables and their friends wouldn't come to dowdy parties. The Rohatyns were squelched.
Then came Oct. 13, 1987, the stock market plunge and Wall Street jitters. Never mind. A week later Nouvelle socialites stepped out in $25,000 poufs to welcome Christian Lacroix, with his couture collection, Luxe, to New York. Then Tom Wolfe's social satire in ''The Bonfire of the Vanities'' - ''Hemorrhaging money!
In some ways, the style of this new society seemed of another century. The period of Louis XIV was mentioned more than once. Donald Trump compared the workmanship on his Trump Towers apartment to Versailles. Court caterers, florists, party planners, decorators and even a troubadour arose to satisfy new and expensive tastes. Auction houses and antiques dealers threw open their doors. Fashion designers stretched out their arms.
In other ways, the Nouvelles seemed the purest expression of the Reagan economic philosophy, which celebrated personal wealth. If this philosophy blurred class distinctions, press agentry buried them.
After all those stories about all those parties, the public could hardly be expected to discern any difference between Pat Buckley of the Old Guard and Ivana Trump of the Nouvelles - not with Mrs. Buckley and friends posing for the paparazzi on the Trump yacht.
 
Stung by Excesses
Nor did the public really care. But the Old Guard did, and by the summer of 1988 its members were being stung by the Nouvelle excesses.
''It's Marie Antoinette time,'' Mrs. Buckley remarked that fall. ''It's the new people. They're getting us mixed up with them.''
Everybody agreed it was time to tone down, at least in public. Liz Smith declared the Nouvelle Austerity on the charity circuit. No more fancy foods and flowers. Shades of the Rohatyns. Some couples said they would cut down on parties, stay home and boil an egg. Maybe some did. Others put on evening clothes and went out again.
The Reagans left the White House. Jerry Zipkin, Nancy Reagan's confidant and permanent representative to New York, though, was still squiring women whose husbands were too busy or too bored to take them to parties. The spring social season was somewhat muted. The Nouvelles had gone underground.
Suddenly last summer, back-to-back fantasy parties broke out. The revels were miles from New York, but news of Nouvelles travels. First was the $1 million party Gayfryd Steinberg gave for her husband in Quogue, N.Y. The next week brought reports of the $2 million-plus party Malcolm Forbes gave for himself in Tangier, Morocco.
That did it. More criticism. More satire. In November 1989, Mrs. Astor, again in diamonds, presided at another important black-tie dinner. As the cameras clicked, she covered her necklace with a chiffon scarf. Her photo appeared in Women's Wear Daily, with those of other women wearing the discreet jewelry of the new Soft Society.
''Forget the hard flash of the Nouvelle Society Eighties,'' said an article accompanying the photographs. ''People are fed up with opulent excess and social showoffs.''

It May Prove Difficult to Let Panama Get On With Its Life

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER

DATELINE: PANAMA

 BODY:
As American troops sought to secure order here last week after having ousted Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega from power, the American invasion of Panama turned into an occupation.
No sooner had resistance from the last remnants of General Noriega's forces ended than United States troops and diplomats assumed police duties and supervised the organization of a civilian government -functions reminiscent of the ''elder brother'' role Americans have played here since Theodore Roosevelt created the country to be able to build the Panama Canal.
The critical question is how long the Americans intend to fill the vacuum left by the ouster on Dec. 20 of General Noriega and his Panama Defense Forces, which dominated every government here for 21 years.
''It is too soon to start putting a date and a number together,'' said a Pentagon spokesman, Pete Williams. But civilian officials, both American and Panamanian, were thinking of the matter constantly. They appeared to agree that the sooner the withdrawal takes place, the better. 
''The longer the troops are here, the greater will be the temptation for both sides to fall back into all the bad habits of the colonial relationship that the Panama Canal treaties were intended to end,'' a European diplomat here said. ''This Government needs to establish itself as an independent entity, and it cannot do that so long as the 82d Airborne Division is on every street corner.''
For the moment, the American presence is overwhelming.
The President installed by the Americans, Guillermo Endara, and his Cabinet spent their first days operating out of cramped quarters in the Foreign Ministry building because the presidential palace was in the hands of American authorities.
When Foreign Minister Julio Linares went to meet the diplomatic corps for the first time, he did so in an American Embassy vehicle. At least initially, security for top Panamanian officials was being provided by Americans because the loyalty of what remains of the Panama Defense Forces was still in question.
 
A Question of Legality
In addition, American and Panamanian officials were reluctant to address the legal justification for spiriting Col. Luis del Cid, accused of being one of General Noriega's accomplices in crime, off to Miami last week to face charges of drug trafficking and racketeering. American officials said the action was necessary because the Panamanian Constitution does not permit the extradition of Panamanian citizens to the United States.
Mr. Endara disagreed with suggestions that the country had surrendered some of its sovereignty in exchange for ridding itself of General Noriega and his mafia. ''We will maintain our independence,'' he said. ''The gringos don't plan to affect our independence.''
But that argument has not convinced most Latin American countries. They continued to hold back on diplomatic relations with the new Government, which had informed the world of its assumption of power on a United States Government fax machine.
Latin American diplomats said that some members of the Organization of American States favored linking such recognition, as well as Panama's readmission to the Group of Eight, the regional club of democracies, to the withdrawal of American troops.
The Bush Administration's ouster of General Noriega was of concern to Cuba, whose ambassador here was detained briefly by American troops, and to Nicaragua, which has been able to circumvent an American economic embargo only by using Panama as a resupply center for needed goods and equipment.
Both countries have lost a valuable ally and, acting together, they began efforts last week to have the United Nations condemn the American invasion.
Both Cuba and Nicaragua have also said, at least for domestic consumption, that they feared that the invasion of Panama might presage similar moves against them.
A few Panamanians and some officials of other Latin American countries have suggested that one way for the Endara Government to put some distance between itself and its American patrons would be to call new elections to ratify the results of the vote last May, in which Mr. Endara achieved a majority only to see it nullified by General Noriega.
But in his first news conference, Mr. Endara quickly quashed the notion of a new ballot. ''We were elected for five years,'' he said, ''and it is our obligation to serve that term.''
Later, the same electoral tribunal that had deprived him of victory in May declared him the winner and allowed him to drop his ''provisional'' title and become full ''constitutional President.''
The United States' desire to get out of Panama quickly could well be blocked by the need to clean out the Panama Defense Forces so that another Noriega can never take power.
A senior American Embassy official here said that the replacement for the Panama Defense Forces, the new Public Force, ''is basically the same officers, the same men, the same structure'' as General Noriega's corrupt and brutal military, ''except that they say they support democracy where before they said they supported Noriega.''
 
A Problem to Confront
''There is a problem to be worked on, no question about it,'' the American official added.
The difficulties range from possible criminal charges against senior officers to assuring that the new forces accept the principle of civilian supremacy.
Panamanians of all classes seem for the moment not to be disturbed by the prospect of a long-term American presence, and are counting instead on an American bonanza. But such a bonanza is unlikely to materialize, and this raises the possibility that expectations will give way to resentments when they are not fulfilled.
The rich, for example, anticipate a huge flow of investment back into the country's offshore banking industry. The middle class expects Washington to pick up the tab for stores and residences destroyed in the fighting and subsequent looting. And the poor assume that the American authorities will provide them with food and shelter.
''We belong to you, and we need you to take care of us,'' Waldina Samaniego, a 33-year-old Panamanian woman, said to a Spanish-speaking American soldier guarding a military installation in the working-class neighborhood of San Miguelito one morning last week.
''Everything is being taken care of,'' the soldier reassured her.
Whether both sides will still be saying the same things three months from now will say much about the shape and the character of the new Panama.

HEADLINE: WEEK IN BUSINESS;
Commodity Prices Spurred by Cold

BYLINE: By Steve Dodson

 BODY:

Cold weather drove prices up sharply for several commodities last week. Futures contracts for heating oil reached six-year highs, peaking at $1.02 a gallon before profit taking caused declines at week's end. In November, heating oil futures sold for slightly less than 60 cents a gallon. An explosion that shut down the nation's second-largest refinery, an Exxon complex in Louisiana, added to the upward pressure. The record-breaking cold extended into Florida and south Texas, damaging winter crops of fruit and vegetables. Orange juice futures rose to $1.65 a pound; the previous week they had traded around $1.25. The Brazilian authorities pushed prices up further when they said they were suspending orange juice exports while they assessed the price situation.
Control of Campbell Soup could be unraveling because of a split in the Dorrance family, which owns almost 59 percent of the shares. Since the death of Campbell's chairman, John T. Dorrance Jr., in April, the family had been saying that it wanted to keep the company. But last week three of his nieces and their husbands, who collectively control 17.4 percent of the company, told the S.E.C. they wanted to sell their interests. Mr. Dorrance's two sons and one daughter control 31 percent of the company and are still saying they oppose a sale. The day of the nieces' announcment Campbell's stock rose $4.375 a share, to $57.375. 
A new enforcement chief was named at the Securities and Exchange Commission. The choice was William R. McLucas, 39 years old, who has been with the commission for 12 years and has worked on many of the big insider-trading cases. He will succeed Gary G. Lynch. The head of the S.E.C., Richard C. Breeden, also announced the formation of a new enforcement unit to deal with fraud against individual investors by banks and savings institutions.
The Bank of New England is shopping for a new chief executive as it struggles to deal with mounting losses on real estate loans in the troubled New England property market. The board of the nation's 18th largest bank said Walter J. Connolly would leave the post as soon as a replacement was found. There was no mention of whether he would remain as chairman. The Boston-based bank earned about $122 million in the first nine months of this year, but it expects a fourth-quarter loss that analysts say may exceed $500 million.
A stake in Bank of Boston was bought by Laurence A. Tisch, the president of CBS. Bank of Boston is also suffering from poor real estate loans. The Tisch group paid $94.5 million for a 6.6 percent stake.
The leading indicators were up a scant one-tenth of a percent in November, suggesting that growth in 1990 will be weak at best. The decline in the October index was revised to three-tenths of a percent instead of four-tenths . . . Sales of existing homes rose 3.2 percent in November, the biggest gain in 11 months.
The financial markets were quiet in a holiday week. In Tokyo, Japanese officials raised the discount rate to 4.25 percent, from 3.75 percent, but that did not keep the Tokyo stock market from ending the year with a record high close of 38,915.87 on the Nikkei average, up 20 percent in 1989. The Japanese rate increase was partially intended to help the dollar, and the dollar did show some modest gains on the yen. The bond market in the United States showed a little uneasiness about inflation because of the jump in some commodity prices, but volume was thin and the action was not considered significant. In stocks, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 41.81 points during the week and closed at 2,753.20. That is 584.63 points, or 26.96 percent, higher than where it began 1989 at 2,168.57.
Receivers were appointed in Australia to oversee the brewing interests that are the main business of the Bond Corporation. The court action, taken on a request by Bond's bank lenders, was seen as a grave threat to the diversified empire that Alan Bond built. The holdings include G. Heileman Brewing of La Crosse, Wis.
Eastern Airlines is cutting 600 jobs and reducing the salaries of half its work force by 10 to 20 percent. The changes will affect mostly managerial employees. Eastern said it would need fewer workers as it scales back operations as part of its plan to emerge from bankruptcy.
Miscellanea. American Express will sell its Geneva-based private banking unit to CBI, a Swiss financial institution, for $1 billion. The unit, with assets of about $12 billion, serves wealthy clients . . . The consensus on the Christmas shopping season seemed to be sales gains of about 4 to 6 percent over the previous year, with heavy discounting holding down profits . . . Fares on the Trump and Pan Am Shuttles are going up to $119, from $99, one-way on flights between New York and Boston or Washington.

HEADLINE: Prospects;
How High for Oil?

BYLINE: By Barnaby J. Feder

 BODY:
Frigid temperatures across much of the United States this month sent demand for heating oil soaring, providing a final upward jolt to crude oil prices. Some spot crude traded at prices up 40 percent or more from a year ago. Will these prices hold? Five experts on oil offer their views. 
 
Phillip Chisholm
 
Executive director, Petroleum Marketers Association of America, Washington.
The big price hikes in products like home heating oil over the past two weeks don't represent a long-term trend. When the weather breaks, we will return to price stability, at least for the duration of 1990. A lot of things could upset that, such as a tax on imported oil. A year ago at this time, no one would have predicted the Exxon Valdez accident and the short-term run-up in prices that caused. But absent such blips, you'll see stability. You won't see gasoline prices go above last year's peaks next year, for example.
 
Morris Greenberg
 
Director of energy services, the WEFA Group, Bala Cynwyd, Pa.
There's a lot of uncertainty about the balance in the first half of next year. It looks like there're ample supplies and prices should come down. I wouldn't expect OPEC to be able to cut output so the oversupply could be particularly significant if the economy weakens. But there could be significant volatility. There's far more reliance on Middle East supplies than we got used to in the middle 1980's. That makes it more difficult to react to short-term shocks, such as the recent cold weather. And refiners and consumers have gotten into the habit of living with smaller inventories, which contributes to volatility.
 
Michael Canes
 
Chief economist, American Petroleum Institute, Washington.
Production has been declining in the U.S. at a pretty rapid rate. It should help production that prices are up from a year ago but the drilling rate is still low. Overseas, there are some places coming on - especially North Yemen and India, where it replaces imports - but others are past their peak. Right now, the trends are toward increased OPEC export capacity. But how much of that comes on in 1990 is unclear. Non-OPEC supply should diminish. On balance, OPEC's hand will be strengthened, which could mean upward pressure in the crude markets.
 
Daniel Yergin
 
Cambridge Energy Research Associates, Cambridge, Mass.
Demand is growing. It's strongest in the Far East, but there are signs of it elsewhere including in some developing countries. There will be a lot of discussion in 1990 about the rate at which surplus capacity is disappearing. It's been eaten up a lot more rapidly than people expected a couple of years ago. And the environmental agenda will begin shaping the energy outlook for the whole decade. Natural gas looks like it will be the big beneficiary. I would expect to see stepped up domestic exploration for both oil and gas.
 
Phillip K. Verleger Jr.
 
Visiting Fellow, Institute for International Economics, Washington.
I think prices are going to weaken toward the end of the first quarter, probably substantially. We have classic unexpected seasonal demand now because of the cold weather, but as that wears off you will see the effects of OPEC setting its production levels too high. West Texas Intermediate, for example, will decline to between $18 and $19 a barrel, then climb back to about $20 by the end of year. That's assuming the economy performs as expected - about 1 percent growth in G.N.P. The other big uncertainty is the U.S.S.R. If their production drops more than 4 percent, prices could stengthen.

HEADLINE: Banking's High-Tech Retail Chase

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
IN the battle among banks for retail customers, the victors are likely to be those that use high technology best. So banks are now spending more than $10 billion a year on electronic technology to attract more customers, serve them more efficiently and keep staffs free to sell more profitable products.
The contest is evident everywhere. Customers of the People's Bank of Bridgeport, Conn., can call from auto showrooms to arrange a loan in as little as 15 minutes. Chase Manhattan promotes its credit cards by listing 34 features, including a free worldwide message network and a legal services program. Teller machines of the National Bank of Commerce in Memphis dispense coupons redeemable for Campbell soups. When the Dollar Dry Dock Savings Bank of New York was raiding customers from a nearby Chemical Bank branch, Dollar Dry Dock teller machines were programmed to flash a reminder about free gifts every time a Chemical customer slipped in a card.
These skirmishes reflect the struggle to wring profits from retail banking and the extent to which innovative marketing will depend on technology. Automated teller machines, telephones and plastic cards are the weapons. Long gone are the days when banks could be content to pump out generic Visas and Mastercards. Now they are trying to become brand names in their own right. 
The cashless society is still a long way off, but banks are hastening the day when going cash-less might be easier than going card-less. Twenty years ago, when Chemical Bank installed the nation's first automated teller machine, it was a primitive contraption that did nothing but dispense cash in $15 and $30 lots. Back then, BankAmericard, the forerunner of Visa, was a local program of the California-based Bank of America. And when a customer called a bank, another live person came on the line.
 
Following Customers Everywhere
Now, a web of computers, telephones and plastic cards lets banks serve their customers wherever they travel and work. ''The credit cards allowed banks to follow their customers across state lines and provide banking services nationally, despite the antiquated branching laws,'' said D. Dale Browning, the president of Colorado National Bank. By giving customers instant loans at any store that accepts credit cards, banks created an industry that is now one of the most profitable parts of their business.
Teller machines now dispense cash down to the penny, accept deposits, transfer money and, in the newest models, help customers apply for mortgages and loans. Banking by phone handles everything from auto loan applications to bill-paying, all with beeps, tones and recordings.
Teller machines and telephone banking services have not generated the same profits as credit cards. But they are crucial for consumer banking, especially in large cities where competition is most intense. Both let banks cut costs and extend their reach far beyond their home states.
Automation and electronics can help limit the growth of costly bank branches, 40 percent of them money-losers. Branches will not disappear. But bankers want teller machines and telephone banking to free the branch staff for selling more profitable products like mutual funds.
Gradually, bank customers are learning to love teller machines, if not as much as bankers would like. Banks have fueled the romance by linking teller machines nationally. ''Customers for some time have come to assume that merchants - with some exceptions like grocery stores - will accept credit cards,'' said J. Paul Bouchelle, executive vice president at the First National Bank of Albuquerque, N.M. ''Now we are reaching a point with automated teller machines that when they see one, they are inclined to expect that they have a card that will let them get cash.''
The nation's 70,000 automated teller machines still belong to individual banks, but almost all also belong to at least one of more than 600 sharing systems. Machines in these systems can serve customers of other banks. Chemical Bank has more than 300 automated tellers, but its customers have access to 28,000 terminals around the country - more, it contends, than any other bank.
The two largest networks of automated tellers - Plus System Inc., an affiliate of Visa, and Cirrus System Inc., a subsidiary of MasterCard - have agreed to grant access to each others' members. When the competing systems link up in June, customers will find that their cash cards work in 44,000 terminals.
Bankers say their surveys show that machines please. ''The automated teller machines answer real consumer dissatisfactions - the inability to get cash after banking hours and long teller lines,'' said Douglas D. Anderson, an executive vice president at the Corestates Financial Corporation in Philadelphia.
But the machines often do not eliminate enough flesh-and-blood tellers for banks to realize any savings. Studies show that a heavily used automated teller can handle transactions for a third to half the cost of a human teller. But if volume is lacking, the machine can cost more than twice as much as the employee.
Bankers have developed a score of strategies for the machines to grind out profits. The North Fork Bank and Trust Company of Long Island installed teller machines near the beaches but far from most of its own customers. The 39-cent fee collected for each use by another bank's customer more than cover the machines' $10,000 to $12,000 annual cost.
In New York, the Dollar Dry Dock Savings Bank flashes ads for its other products during pauses between transactions. Citibank executives say their New York network of 1,100 machines has been a key to expanding its share of the New York consumer market to more than 13 percent from less than 5 percent in 1977.
 
Banking by Phone
Telephone banking also reaches far beyond the traditional, local branch. Customers can send instructions to a bank computer using the tones on push-button phones. According to a survey last year by Banking and Computer magazine, 23 percent of financial institutions were offering telephone banking compared with 13 percent in 1987.
Executives of the People's Bank of Bridgeport, Conn. say that their early introduction of banking by phone has been vindicated. ''When we began the bank by phone service in 1974 it was a very unusual feature,'' said Pat Matteson, a senior vice president. People's finds it has toinnovate to stay ahead ofother banks with telephone service. The Connecticut bank has added loans by phone, handling as many loans as several branches combined. Customers waiting in automobile showrooms can get approval in as little as 15 minutes. Last year, about 30 percent of the bank's individual retirement account rollovers were handled by phone.
Bankers hope more customers let their fingers do the banking. George W. Cole, director of marketing at Periphonics, a vendor of bank-by-phone equipment, noted that for the cost of one telephone operator, a bank can buy the computers and software to handle four phone lines simultaneously, 24 hours a day. ''As much as 25 percent of the calls come on weekends, when most people do their shopping, but the banks are closed,'' Mr. Cole said. Although three-fourths of the calls are for account balances, Mr. Cole said that telephone banking was expanding to include bill-paying. Customers can push buttons on their phones to give the bank instructions for writing checks.
 
Credit Card Boom
To steer more account-holders toward the telephones, some banks offer incentives. At the National Westminster Bank of New Jersey, the 40 percent of its customers who bank by phone earn a half-point more interest on their money market accounts. Thomas J. Dzurkoc, a bank vice president, said that because these customers are not allowed to write their own checks on such accounts, costs are reduced. ''An even greater benefit to us is that bank-by-phone customers are more loyal, have more account relationships and keep higher balances,'' he said.
The credit card business was a money-loser as recently as 10 years ago, but banks have turned it into one of their most profitable lines. There are 190 million cards, with unpaid balances of more than $113 billion. In the wallet wars, it counts to be the first one a consumer reaches for.
The business is profitable enough to attract new competitors like Sears, Roebuck & Company, whose 29.6 million Discover cards are accepted by a million merchants. And A.T.&T. - whose telephone cards are the most widely used credit cards of all - is expected to introduce a more broadly accepted credit card soon.
The 5,000 banks that issue credit cards are spending millions on advertising to convince consumers that their cards are somehow unique. Bankers are no longer content to remain anonymous behind the Visa and Mastercard logos - they're putting their own up front.
As more cards are concentrated among a few dozen large banks, they are less willing to have their products regarded as generic commodities. Like food companies competing for supermarket display space, bankers plot to put their plastic in the most accessible slot in consumers' billfolds. And they want distinctive brand names. Citibank, easily the largest bank card issuer in the country, with more than 25 million cards, addresses the issue directly in its television commercials: ''Not just Visa. Citibank Visa.''
Les Dinkin, a management consultant at KPMG Peat Marwick, said that a brand image can be as valuable for a bank as for a food product. ''It allows a company to charge a premium price for their product, and creates a better platform for expansion.'' After 20 years of promotions, Visa and Mastercard have won wide acceptance. ''But the banks were left without a proprietary product, and now have to overcome the perception that one card is pretty much as good as another,'' he said.
While only Citibank advertises on television nationally, thousands of other banks are filling mailboxes and crowding hotel check-out counters with their card offerings. But large banks are expanding their market share, using many of the same advantages that caused small banks to fight nationwide branching. ''The smaller and medium-sized issuers don't enjoy the economies of scale and the economies of sophistication that the major issuers have,'' said Scott P. Marks, chairman of FCC National Bank, the Delaware bank that issues cards for the First Chicago Corporation.
Economies of scale begin with a credit card loan portfolio of $1 billion to $2 billion, allowing the purchase of computers to reduce paperwork, Mr. Marks said. The economies of sophistication come with a portfolio of at least $3 billion, enough to hire marketing specialists. As one of the banking industry's five largest card issuers, Mr. Marks said, ''I can acquire new accounts more cost efficiently . . . and I can stimulate usage of the cards more effectively.''
As banks quest for brand identity, they have introduced all sorts of special features, which are inevitably matched by competitors. Chase Manhattan was among the many banks to match American Express's insurance for recent purchases.
Mr. Marks of First Chicago says that annual growth of more than 20 percent in credit card balances over the past five years means that the industry has yet to mature. ''Over the next five years, I expect the industry to continue growing comfortably in double digits, but not as fast as the past five years,'' he said. Next: Debit Cards? The next generation of cards is proving harder for banks to promote. Bankers want customers to regard their teller cards as debit cards and use them for much more than cash withdrawals. The cards would make it easy for merchants with the proper terminals to accept payment by automatically deducting funds from customers' bank accounts. Banks would gain tremendous savings as the volume of paper checks fell.
But debit cards face several obstacles, according to Gary S. Roboff, a vice president at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company and president of the New York Cash Exchange, the largest regional network of teller machines. ''The problem for the industry has been a lack of agreement about how the costs should be shared among merchants, bankers and consumers,'' he said. While Visa and Mastercard have considered a nationwide debit card, neither has promoted the idea aggressively enough. ''No single bank can afford to build its own system alone,'' Mr. Roboff said. ''And merchants' main concern is selling goods, so they want to be sure that whatever system they take will accept everybody,'' not just the customers of a particular bank.
Bankers are not abandoning the effort. In October, the New York Cash Exchange introduced a system of terminals at check-out counters in Wegman's Supermarkets. The terminals accept a wide variety of cards.
But Mr. Anderson of Corestates says that consumers will require more incentives to welcome debit cards. ''It may be necessary to make it economically attractive for consumers to use it, or put another way, economically unattractive not to use it,'' he said. Grocery stores already have some incentives, he added. It costs them 50 cents to process a check, and only slightly less to handle a cash purchase necessitating cash counting, security and insurance. As computers have become cheaper, the cost of processing an electronic payment has fallen to about 25 cents.
For bankers, finally establishing a presence at grocery check-outs is not just a distant dream. If they have their way, the day may be approaching when cash is no longer king.

HEADLINE: 'Open Outcry' Works Well and Cheaply

BYLINE: By Morton Lane; Morton Lane is president of the Discount Corporation of New York Futures. He is a director of the Futures Industry Association.

 BODY:
FOR a number of very basic reasons, I think the open outcry system of trading futures contracts will be with us for a long time to come. The pit system is cheap, efficient and enormously successful. In contrast, the architects of computerized trading systems have yet to show that they can compete economically with the pit system.
Consider: In 1988, the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange produced nearly 60 million transactions in the pits on a contract volume of 220 million. Volume is even higher this year, and has grown every single year since financial futures were introduced in 1972. Billions of dollars worth of financial transactions are processed through the system every day. 
The futures pits are both durable and adaptable. The pits in which we trade Eurodollar and Treasury bond futures are simply adaptations of the pits in which Chicago has traded corn and cattle for decades.
The financial world trades futures in massive volume, and it does so because futures are cheaper to trade than the real thing. Perhaps the most striking evidence of this is that primary government securities dealers, who can trade actual Treasury notes and bonds more cheaply than anyone, choose to do nearly one-fourth of all their Treasury bond transactions in the pits in Chicago rather than in their own cash market.
For computers to compete with such a successful mechanism, they must offer better transactions at lower cost. The most obvious of these costs, fees paid by traders to the exchanges, are currently very low. The Chicago exchanges charge members between 20 and 50 cents per contract for each of those 220 million contracts that they trade. Non-member commissions are much higher, but these have been driven down by competition to about one-third of what they were at the beginning of the decade.
Contrast this with early indications of fees on the new electronic exchanges. The semi-automated Tokyo International Financial Futures Exchange recommends customer commissions which are two to three times the rate of existing levels. Globex - the automated system proposed for the Chicago Mercantile Exchange - is expected to increase member fees by several multiples of what they now pay. Given the choice between the pit and the personal computer, I doubt that many will pay extra for the pristine circuitry of computerized trading. A more subtle cost of trading is the bid/ask spread. This is the amount a trader would have to pay to reverse a trade immediately. The spread can also be viewed as what market makers earn in exchange for providing bids and offers.
Futures pits have been remarkably efficient at providing tight bid/ask spreads. Aided by the low exchange fees, traders compete fiercely to provide market-making services. The result is that in the most active commodity pits - the Eurodollar and Treasury bond and note pits - the bid/ask spread is only one tick (the minimum bid possible on the exchange) wide.
Whether the computerized systems can meet the one-tick bid/ask spreads that are available already in the Chicago (and Singapore, for that matter) trading pits is a question that will bedevil the electronic markets. If the traders who compete to provide such markets have to pay more to trade, how can they bid and offer as aggressively as they do in the pits? And if the bid/ask spreads are wider and the bids and offers smaller in the computerized systems, why should anyone trade there? RECOGNITION of this potential flaw in Globex may be the reason behind the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's recent decision to suspend fees for a limited time and for a limited number of large market participants when Globex finally opens next year. If so, they are on the right track, but temporary solutions will not be enough. Finally, there are intangibles that have to be overcome. Locals see the flow of orders and are confident that they are at the center of all such flows. A trader at a terminal will not have as much information. This will increase his risk for which he will need to be compensated. This will again translate in to wider spreads.
I don't mean to suggest that computer trading will not find its niche. It will certainly become cheaper. Nor do I want to suggest that computers cannot help improve the pits by providing certain other functions more efficiently. They already do.
The computer and futures industries have been running on parallel tracks for more than a decade. My guess is that they will continue to march forward together. But I suspect that in the year 2001, when computers are even faster and more powerful, the pits will continue to exist.

Not Everyone Makes Resolutions

BYLINE: By TRISH HALL

 BODY:
For some people the dawn of the century's final decade is not an occasion for cosmic resolutions or personal soul searching.
''I just want to get through it,'' said Susanne Volk, who has made the same vows she makes every year: to get in shape and to pay off her bills. Ms. Volk, who is 27 years old and works as the personal assistant to a rich and famous New Yorker, said the new decade does not coincide with any milestones in her life. ''I'm not 30, I don't have a new job and I'm not getting married,'' she said. She is going to a black-tie dance tonight at the Harvard Club, however, rather than the usual bonfire party with friends. ''It seems more festive,'' she said, ''more memorable.'' 
But for others who were stopped in their holiday wanderings and asked about the New Year, the turn of the last decade of the century is a special time, made more meaningful for some by the recent events in Eastern Europe. ''This year seems like a focal point for change,'' said Christopher Walsh, a 24-year-old accountant at Prudential-Bache Securities who recently moved to New York. ''People are moving together.'' Maybe that will help him carry out his New Year's resolution: he is hoping to meet more people.
 
The Business of the Future
Richard Pait, a captain in the United States Army, said he is excited about the new decade. Because he is convinced that future battles will be economic, he has resolved to go into business when he retires in six years, at the age of 37. ''The shaping of the world will cease to be through military might,'' he said.
Gerard Koch, who is retired from the Museum of Natural History, is glad this decade is ending. ''The '80s were bad, very bad,'' he said. ''There is more hope now than there has been in a long time.'' As for resolutions, however, he has more or less given up on them. ''If I want to do something, I'll do something,'' he said.
Avis Langston, too, is glad to be rid of the 80's, which she associates with ''all those drug problems.'' Of the 90's she said, ''I know this is going to be something different, and I hope it's something good.'' Mrs. Langston, an immigrant from Aruba who lives in Brooklyn and works for Marriott Food Service, also has some hopes that lie closer to home. ''I want to lose 10 pounds, and to do my best for my son, for him to grow up in the right way,'' she said.
Juan Ortega, who works as a security guard for the World Financial Center and lives in Brooklyn with his wife and two sons, is less optimistic. As the decade has progressed, he said, he has seen more grimness in the hundreds of people who cross his path each day. ''Everybody is busy,'' he said. ''They go their own way.'' His life is different. He will spend tonight with his five brothers and four sisters, paying homage to their mother, who died almost two years ago. ''For me it's a special occasion,'' he said. ''We get together and we remember my mother. She was a nice person who helped people.'' There will be food and drinks and talk. ''Some will cry. Some will be quiet,'' he said. ''When you have lost your mother, that is something to remember all your life.''
 
Just Another Work Night
For some people, New Year's is just another work night. Sandy Dehner, who coordinates equipment hookups for Reuters, the news service, has a second job as a waitress, and she'll be working tonight. ''I just want to save money and stop spending so much,'' she said. Ms. Dehner, who is 25, said the 80's was her time to grow up. ''I accomplished all the things I wanted - a job, a car - and now it's time to settle down, get married and have a family,'' she said.
Della Fraites, who has been selling stuffed animals at her daughter's pushcart in the South Street Seaport, said she will spend the evening disassembling the business to meet a midnight deadline. ''That's when our lease runs out,'' she said. ''That's how exciting my New Year's is.''

HEADLINE: WHEAT RIFT SPLITS NIGERIANS AND U.S.

BYLINE: By KENNETH B. NOBLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LAGOS, Nigeria

 BODY:
A bitter trade dispute with the United States over wheat imports is posing a tough challenge for Nigeria's President, Gen. Ibrahim Babangida, and is likely to come up when he visits Washington next month to meet with President Bush.
The dispute arose over Nigeria's decision in 1986 to ban the importing of wheat and other basic food items in an effort to increase domestic food production.
Before the ban, Nigeria spent around $250 million a year on imported wheat, mostly from the United States, making it the sixth-largest market for American wheat. Overall, Nigeria - with more than 100 million people - has usually been the largest market for American goods in black-ruled Africa. 
American officials here in the Nigerian capital have strongly criticized the ban as an unfair trade practice and have warned that the Bush Administration may take retaliatory steps for Nigeria's open refusal to buy American wheat.
''This is going to be the ey issue when Babangida goes to Washington, and there's going to be a lot of effort made to resolve this issue,'' a United States official here said. He added that the Administration is under pressure from Americann farmers' groups to retaliate unless Nigeria soon opens its markets.
 
U.S. Pressure Lacked Subtlety
In the view of Nigerian officials, the dispute has been sharpened by what they consider the impolitic way that American officials here have put pressure on them to end the ban. Nigerian officials were particularly angered by a speech by the former United States Ambassador, Princeton Lyman, who said that the import ban was counterproductive because it encouraged smuggling.
''If Nigeria bans American agricultural products,'' Mr. Lyman said, ''and then smuggles in wheat flour and rice from other sources, the issue becomes much more serious between us.'' He estimated that at least 300,000 tons of smuggled wheat flour and rice are entering the West African country each year.
Citing trade legislation that requires that the Administration report to Congress those countries that discriminate against American imports, Mr. Lyman added, ''Trade sanctions are called for if no redress is possible.''
The Nigerian position has since hardened, and the reasons, many political analysts here say, have less to do with agricultural production than with national pride.
''The Americans miscalculated how important this issue is to us,'' a senior Nigerian diplomat said. ''They don't seem to understand that our primary objective is economic self-sufficiency, and making money for American wheat farmers pales by comparison.''
 
No Edicts for Nigerians
''Nigerians hate more than anything else to have someone come and tell us what to do, or to dictate to us,'' said Akindele Oyebode, a law professor at the University of Lagos. ''That's a great insult.''
In a much-quoted editorial, the official New Nigerian said the ban on wheat imports should be maintained despite the ''threat'' by Ambassador Lyman. ''The fundamental question,'' the editorial argued, is whether Nigeria will be able to ''get rid of the idea of accepting bread as a major consumer item in our basic food.''
Later, the United States Embassy, in an effort to dilute criticism here of American trade policy, issued a statement saying there were no immediate plans to impose trade sanctions. ''There is absolutely no blackmail, subtle or otherwise, intended in the American position,'' the statement said.
In recent weeks, however, in preparation for the President's visit, efforts to resolve the issue have intensified. ''We're at an impasse,'' an American official conceded.
When Nigeria became independent from Britain in 1960, its agricultural products were the prime source of export earnings, and subsistence farming fed many. But the oil boom of the late 1960's and 1970's changed that. It lured millions from the farms and villages to seek riches in the cities. Eventually, oil prices collapsed, but agriculture did not revive.
 
Necessity Breeds Austerity
The growing fragility of Nigeria's economy in the early 1980's prompted the Government to adopt a stringent austerity program. From the beginning, reducing agricultural imports while improving domestic food production was a major element.
So far, according to statistics provided by the Nigerian Government, wheat production has dramatically increased since the import ban - from virtually nothing five years ago to more than 500,000 tons in 1989. During the peak import years, Nigeria bought roughly 1.4 million tons of American wheat a year, in addition to rice, dairy products and sugar.
But Western economists and agricultural experts, in recent interviews, disputed the Government's wheat-production estimates. And a 1989 report by the United States Department of Agriculture called the Nigerian estimates exaggerated and said ''production of over 100,000 metric tons is unlikely.''
''The problem,'' a Western economist said, ''is that the wheat ban is enormously popular here because it seems to be working. And politically, that makes it almost impossible for Babangida to abandon it, lest he appear to be bowing to pressure from the United States.''

HEADLINE: Threatened Northwest Flight Lands Safely

BYLINE: By ERIC WEINER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Dec. 30

 BODY:
With fortress-like security thrown up to meet a threatened attack, an almost empty Northwest Airlines jumbo jet from Paris landed here today, uneventfully except for the crush of reporters and television crews assigned to greet the few passengers.
Most of the 130 people originally booked on the plane, a DC-10 that holds 284 passengers, changed their plans after the airline began informing ticket holders on Thursday of a ''security threat'' against the flight.
Flight 51 left Charles de Gaulle Airport this afternoon, delayed two hours because of fog, with only 22 passengers on board, including a public relations representative from Northwest and three reporters. After a nine-hour flight, the plane landed at Detroit's Metro Airport shortly before 5 P.M.
''It went off without a hitch,'' said Robert Gibbons, a company spokesman in Minneapolis. 
Passengers arriving here told of spacious seating, free drinks and a feeling of camaraderie. As they entered the airport they were cornered by reporters who outnumbered family members by at least 2 to 1.
''It was a personal stance for me,'' said Suzanne Chenault of Yosemite, Calif. ''I didn't want to take the easy way out.''
Mr. Gibbons said the airline had given the three cockpit crew members and six flight attendants a chance to switch to another flight, but none did.
Northwest acknowledged the threat and began notifying passengers after the Swedish newspaper Kvallspospen carried accounts of it, Mr. Gibbons said.
 
Action Spurs Debate
Aviation security experts said public disclosure of such threats may become more common, and Northwest's action has spurred debate about the advantages of such warnings.
''Terrorists have this tremendous psychological hold over the American public,'' said Bruce Hoffman, a terrorism expert with the Rand Corporation, a research organization. ''Even by not doing anything, they can cause this panic.''
The airline chose not to cancel the flight but took extra security measures for it and all of its flights between Europe and the United States. Northwest offered to book ticket holders on another flight - even on a competing airline - without any penalty.
Northwest and the Federal Aviation Administration declined to say exactly what extra security measures were taken for the flight.
''It would have been the safest airplane in the world to fly,'' said John Leyden, a spokesman for the aviation agency.
Still, at least one passenger was seen nervously clutching a good-luck charm before boarding the flight in Paris.
Security measures at De Gaulle Airport included bomb-sniffing dogs, the use of sophisticated color X-ray machines and hand-searching to check each piece of luggage. At the airport in Detroit, the plane parked half a mile from the gate and passengers were taken to the terminal by bus.
The British news agency Reuters said the Swedish newspaper, citing security sources, quoted an anonymous caller as saying that the action was planned as revenge for the life sentences given two Palestinians in Sweden last week for bomb attacks in three European cities, including a 1985 bombing of a Northwest office in Copenhagen. Northwest, saying it was acting on the advice of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, would not disclose where the call was received or any other details.
Each year, the airlines receive about 400 anonymous threats, but few are aimed at international flights and even fewer are as specific as the one against Flight 51, said Robert Buckhorn, an F.A.A. spokesman. Airlines have notified ticket holders in the past of bomb threats, but never as publicly or with as much advance notice as Northwest had.
Northwest's move was applauded by families of the victims of the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 a year ago over Lockerbie, Scotland, in which 270 people died. The families have criticized the airlines and the Government for not warning ticket holders of a threat against the flight.
Two weeks before the crash of the Pan Am flight on Dec. 21, 1988, the United States Embassy in Finland was warned by a telephone caller that a bomb attack might be carried out against a Pan Am flight over Frankfurt. The United States Government then notified airlines, airports and embassies in Europe, but passengers received no word of the threat.

HEADLINE: H.U.D. Windfall - Subsidies for the Subsidized;
In New York, H.U.D.'s Vouchers Pay for Already Cheap Housing

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINERIP

 BODY:
The showpiece of the Reagan Administration's housing program was a voucher system, created to give a cash subsidy to poor people so they could choose their own rental housing.
But when the voucher system did not work well in New York City, officials of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, eager to fill their quotas, approved vouchers for about 600 families already living in subsidized housing. Under this double subsidy, the families' already low rents dropped to the point where some are now paying no rent at all.
Most of the 600 families who received the H.U.D. vouchers beginning in 1987 were long-term working-class residents of desirable apartments subsidized by New York State and New York City under the Mitchell-Lama program. Typically, they were paying rents of $250 to $300 before being approved for the H.U.D. vouchers. 
 
Most Pay Less Than $50
An examination of city housing records by The New York Times indicates that two-thirds of the 600 families getting vouchers are paying less than $50 a month in rent as a result; 88 percent are paying less than $100. And 7 percent are paying no rent, just a $38 monthly utility fee.
Through the vouchers, which are good for five years, H.U.D. has been giving almost $2 million a year to 600 New York households that were already subsidized, city records indicate. About 20 percent of the vouchers given out in New York City in 1987 and 1988 went to these families.
At a time when hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers are homeless or living doubled-up with friends or relatives, and when city and state officials are pleading for more Federal housing aid, the sizable double subsidy approved by H.U.D. and city officials has surprised even residents of the buildings where families getting the vouchers live.
''There's a lot of people paying $30 or $40 a month rent now who I know could afford to pay more,'' said Donna Mantin, a teacher who is president of the board of Luna Park, a Mitchell-Lama complex in Brooklyn where about 150 families were issued vouchers. ''This money should go toward other programs and people who could use it more.''
While it is difficult to find anyone who says the double subsidy was the best use of scarce Federal housing dollars, it appears that no laws or H.U.D. rules were broken. But it is clear that a program created to help people find housing ended up being used in New York City to assist people who already had housing.
Starting in 1987, H.U.D. officials nationwide were under tremendous pressure from Washington to make the voucher program succeed. The Reagan Administration had made huge cuts in Federal building programs; the voucher plan was one of the few programs to receive more money. It was tailored to the Administration's free-market philosophy: give poor people a housing stipend that they can use to find an apartment in the location and price range of their choice.
Each of H.U.D's 10 regional offices was given a quota and told to distribute rent stipends as quickly as possible. In fiscal year 1987, the New York regional office was directed to give out 12,000 vouchers.
 
Giving Money Away Proved Difficult
Giving money away sounds easy, but it was a difficult task in New York City, where a typical voucher stipend of $250 a month is far below the true market rents. Eight of every nine families on the New York City public housing waiting list who are offered a voucher return it, unable to use it because rents are so high and vacancy rates so low.
But H.U.D. officials in the New York region were determined to meet their voucher quotas. And they did, partly by approving vouchers for hundreds of people already living in subsidized buildings and partly by using the vast majority of the vouchers outside New York City, in other parts of H.U.D.'s New York regional office, like Puerto Rico and upstate New York.
That vouchers are given to reduce rents so dramatically for people already living in subsidized apartments appeared to surprise several top H.U.D. officials who were told by a reporter. John Dellera, the H.U.D. regional counsel in New York, asked if it was possible that the rents were so low because of a clerical miscalculation.
A H.U.D. official in Washington, hearing examples of rents, said, ''Oh my God, I don't believe it.''
Housing advocates reacted angrily. ''Given the incredible housing need in this city, it's an absurd situation,'' said Steven Banks, director of the New York City Legal Aid Society's Homeless Family Rights Project.
Asked if he knew of anywhere else in the country where vouchers were used in this manner, a H.U.D. spokesman in Washington, William Glavin, said, ''Not that we know of.''
Edmund R. Davis, the deputy regional administrator of H.U.D.'s New York office, acknowledged that the 600 families might have enjoyed ''a windfall.'' Yet these were very poor people, he added, making $6,000 to $12,000 a year, and he said choosing them did not represent a significant misuse of the voucher program. ''It's hardly an earth-shattering issue,'' he said.
Mr. Davis said that if anyone was at fault, it was the New York City Housing Preservation and Development Department, for suggesting these buildings to H.U.D. and for being so slow to use vouchers elsewhere.
The City Housing Commissioner, Abraham Biderman, said the city tried, largely unsuccessfully, to use the vouchers for people who had no housing. The department, which is renovating thousands of abandoned buildings across the city, planned to save the vouchers until those apartments were ready, but that was not fast enough for H.U.D., Mr. Biderman said. He said the Mitchell-Lama buildings were among the few places where the city could use vouchers quickly enough to please H.U.D.
''Would it have been better to make the voucher subsidy less deep and use this money for rehab?'' Mr. Biderman asked. ''Obviously, yes.''
 
H.U.D. Calls $428 A Fair-Market Rent
The voucher program in New York City was aimed at people with very low incomes. To qualify, a family of four can earn a maximum of about $16,000; a single elderly person can earn up to $11,000. To calculate the amount of voucher a recipient is entitled to, the Government first makes an estimate of the local ''fair market rent.'' Then it pays the difference between the fair-market rent and 30 percent of the applicant's income.
The fair-market rent set by H.U.D. for a one-bedroom apartment in New York City in 1987 and 1988 was $428. So if a family's income was $833 a month ($10,000 a year), 30 percent of its income would be $250 a month. The $250 monthly income subtracted from the fair-market rent of $428 would result in a voucher worth $178.
The family then is free to take the $178 voucher and use it for any apartment it can find. If it finds a bargain, it can wind up paying less than the Government standard of 30 percent of its income for rent; if it wants a nicer place, it can pay more.
In New York City, however, there are precious few one-bedroom apartments available for $428 a month that meet H.U.D. quality standards - except in the Mitchell-Lama buildings, with their artificially low rents.
This created a problem for poor people, who kept returning the vouchers unused. It created a problem for H.U.D. officials in New York, who were under pressure to meet voucher quotas set in Washington. And it created a problem for New York City housing officials, who were under pressure from H.U.D. to find some fast use for the vouchers.
''We were trying every way to use vouchers,'' Mr. Biderman said. ''The program just doesn't work in New York City.'' in 1987, Housing Preservation and Development officials came up with the idea of using the vouchers in the Mitchell-Lama buildings. ''We had to use them this way or lose them,'' Mr. Biderman said. ''This way at least we helped people of New York City.''
H.U.D. officials enthusiastically agreed, lending two dozen staff members to the city for several months to calculate which residents would receive the vouchers, a highly unusual move.
Mr. Davis said the H.U.D. staff did most of the certifications because the city was moving too slowly to help find needy people.
 
'People Feel Lucky To Live Here'
Typical of the buildings chosen for vouchers were two in Brooklyn: Lindsay Park in Williamsburg and Luna Park in Coney Island. These are large complexes of 20-story brick buildings put up in the early 1960's with low-interest mortgages and tax abatements from the city and state to make them affordable. Residents tend to be government and office workers or retired people. Virtually none are on welfare.
The apartments are considered highly desirable. The waiting list to get into the 1,587-unit Luna Park complex is eight years, said Mrs. Mantin, the board president. The manager of the Lindsay Park complex, Lou Campbell, said: ''People feel lucky to live here. It's a pretty nice place, really.'' To tour Lindsay Park's seven buildings last week was to see basic, comfortable apartments, immaculately clean hallways and grounds, lobbies decorated for the holidays and six outdoor swimming pools.
It was residents of these buildings who were paying more than 30 percent of their income for rent who were chosen to receive vouchers by city and H.U.D. officials. The housing officials picked Mitchell-Lama buildings that had a higher proportion of poor people.
Before 1987, what H.U.D. would have done in such situations was to issue a certificate to reduce a tenant's rent to 30 percent of his income. If a tenant was making $8,000 a year and paying $270 a month in rent - 40 percent of his income - he would have been issued a certificate for $70, to bring his rent down to $200 a month, 30 percent of his income.
But using the voucher - a tool designed for the free market - in buildings where rents had already been subsidized well below market value created a windfall. Under the voucher program, that same person making $8,000 a year and paying $270 a month for rent would get a voucher for $228 a month. That amount represents the difference between the $428 fair-market rent rate and the $200 that is 30 percent of his income.
Under the voucher system, this person's rent would be reduced to $42, plus a $38 a month utility fee.
 
One-Third Pay $20 or Less in Rent
Through a request filed with the city under the Federal Freedom of Information Act, The Times obtained income and rent information on 113 of the approximately 600 households in the Mitchell-Lama buildings who received vouchers in 1987 and 1988. City officials say they are representative of all 600. The city has about 135,000 Mitchell-Lama units. The residents' identities were not revealed.
All pay a monthly utility fee of $38 for heat and electricity, which is excluded from the calculations. Of the 113 households, a third were paying $20 or less for rent after the voucher and 55 percent were paying $40 or less.
After the voucher, most were paying 10 percent to 15 percent of their income for rent and utilites.
These are some samples from the list:
* A single person in a one-bedroom apartment with an annual income of $5,563, who was paying $258 a month, now pays no rent after the voucher.
* Two people in a one-bedroom apartment with an income of $7,566, who were paying $275, pay $26 after the voucher.
* Two people in a one-bedroom apartment with an income of $11,132, who were paying $245, pay $55 after the voucher.
Even people critical of using vouchers this way emphasize that the recipients in these cases were very-low-income people, who were hardly getting rich off the program. But they say it shows the folly of relying so heavily on one housing program nationwide.
''The voucher program works in Dallas, where you have a high vacancy rate,'' said Robert Hayes, founder of the National Coalition for the Homeless. ''But the way they've used it here reflects a very cynical manipulation.''
''A lot of these people need some subsidy,'' Mrs. Mantin said. ''This just wasn't the way to do it.''
 
Meeting the Quota 'Was an Obsession'
On one point there is wide agreement. Joseph D. Monticciolo, the former administrator of the New York regional office of H.U.D., made it clear that the quota would be met, no matter what, H.U.D. officials said. Throughout 1987, a weeky tally was kept of how many vouchers had been allocated.
''Meeting the voucher goal was an obsession to Mr. Monticciolo,'' said David Burns, H.U.D.'s regional economist in New York. ''The subject used to dominate the weekly meetings with his top staff. He considered this his most important goal and he was going to meet it. It disrupted other work in the office. Many people were diverted.''
Mr. Monticciolo's attorney, Robert Hill Schwartz, did not return repeated phone calls last week. But Mr. Dellera, a H.U.D. spokesman, agreed that there was major pressure in the office and that H.U.D. officials, in turn, pressed the city to use the vouchers quickly.
Officials of several housing authorities in New York State that were issued housing vouchers in the spring of 1987 said they were taken away a few months later because Mr. Monticciolo wrote that the local officials were not moving fast enough to have the vouchers used up by the end of the fiscal year, Sept. 30.
George Lyons, director of the Ellenville Housing Authority, in Ellenville, N.Y., said he was given vouchers in May and had them withdrawn in July, though he felt he could have used them. ''They didn't listen,'' he said. The demand to use the vouchers quickly in 1987 set off a major dispute between H.U.D.'s New York office and the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development that continues today.
H.U.D. officials say the city dragged its feet on vouchers because it was skeptical of the program and unfamiliar with it. ''You're on the wrong track if you think it's H.U.D.,'' said Mr. Davis of H.U.D. ''H.P.D. has not lifted a finger'' to make the voucher program work, he said.
Mr. Davis noted that over the course of three years, about 2,500 families on the long waiting list of the New York City Housing Authority were able to find apartments using the vouchers. But he acknowledged that those families were a small minority. Eight of nine families that received the vouchers had to return them unused. And Housing Authority officials have criticized the voucher system as unsuitable for New York City.
Whether the city did not try hard enough or the program was ill conceived, New York City families used far less than their share of vouchers than the rest of the H.U.D. New York region. In 1987 and 1988, about 20,000 vouchers were used in the region, which includes New York, New Jersey, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Fewer than 20 percent of these went to New York City families, although the city's proportionate share of such financing programs in the H.U.D. region is normally twice that, 40 percent.
''Monticciolo put a lot of pressure on the other area offices to make up the shortfall for New York City,'' Mr. Burns said. ''I think the city and state got hurt.''
Mr. Biderman of H.P.D. said the heart of the problem was that Federal funds are really needed to create new affordable housing. Until that happens, he said, vouchers will not have an impact in New York. He pointed out that at the start of the Reagan Administration, the Federal Government was financing ''gut rehabilitation'' of 6,500 units a year in New York City and now is financing a few hundred units a year.
He said the city was slow in using the vouchers because New York officials were hoping to use them in an innovative way. The city's plan was to undertake major renovations of abandoned buildings and save the vouchers to use them as the buildings were opened. But that was nowhere as fast as using them in Mitchell-Lama buildings like Luna Park.
Mrs. Mantin said that when representatives of the Luna Park residents' board started hearing about the unusually low rents, they questioned city housing officials, but were told everything was being done by the rules.
''I guess on paper, it all looks proper,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Upheaval in the East: Espionage;
It's Still Business as Usual for Spies, Even as the Eastern Bloc Rises Up

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 30

 BODY:
For years, experts have dubbed Czechoslovakia's spy agency the ''two Czech'' service. Agents of the Office for the Protection of State Secrets got one check from Prague, the pun goes, and another from their real bosses at K.G.B. headquarters in Moscow.
The disturbing news from Eastern Europe this winter, American intelligence officials say, is that the punch line has not yet changed.
Despite a democratic revolt that has shaken Communist rule in Czechoslovakia and five other Eastern bloc states, those nations' espionage agencies have not slackened their vigorous efforts to steal Western technology and military secrets, often at Soviet direction, several officials said in interviews.
''We don't see very much indication that any of these countries are diminishing their overseas intelligence activities, with the possible exception of a somewhat greater emphasis on their own interests as opposed to the broader interests of the East bloc,'' a State Department official said. 
 
Infancy of Democratic Revolt
That official and others caution that the democratic revolt is still in its infancy. Eastern bloc spy agencies, they predict, will eventually warm to Western-style government and to inducements, like trade agreements, that will reduce their incentive to spy on the West.
They also agree that the radical changes in the East bloc will eventually cripple the ability of the Soviet Union's primary intelligence agency, the K.G.B., to use its old allies as surrogates in espionage battles between East and West.
''In general, what liaison there was is going to break down further; no question about it,'' said an Administration expert who declined to be identified.
''If I were Kryuchkov I wouldn't be a happy man right now,'' he said. Col. Gen. Vladimir A. Kryuchkov is the K.G.B. chief.
Yet there are few signs that such changes are occurring this winter. On the contrary, several Administration officials and private experts said, the K.G.B. appears in some cases to have stepped up its ''tasking'' of Eastern bloc agencies for specific missions against Western targets.
 
Communists in Control
Of the six nations swept by pressures for democratic change - Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Rumania and East Germany - Communists allied with the Soviet Government remain in apparent control of intelligence-related agencies in all but Czechoslovakia and Rumania.
Intelligence experts also noted that there has been but a trickle of defectors from Soviet bloc spy services during the democratic upheaval, although defections usually increase in times of political uncertainty.
Although Central Intelligence Agency officials refused to be interviewed, the Director of Central Intelligence, William H. Webster, said publicly this fall that the warming of East-West relations is stirring an increase in espionage, not a decrease.
In remarks Nov. 29 to the National Press Club, Mr. Webster said it was too early to tell whether Eastern bloc nations would curb their spying on American targets.
''Let us not assume that because we are getting friendly and seeing freedom come up from the streets, that freedom has been endorsed by some of those aggressive intelligence services,'' he said.
 
Well-Founded Concern
Mr. Webster's concern is well-founded, officials say. While the public views espionage as a purely Soviet affair, some of the decade's most damaging spies were recruited and run by the K.G.B.'s East bloc allies.
East German agents managed a ring of spies from 1978 to 1988 inside one of the United States' most sensitive electronic listening posts, atop a wooded hill in West Berlin. The American inquiry into the case has produced one espionage conviction and a guilty plea and is continuing, the Federal Bureau of Investigation said Friday.
Czechoslovak and Polish agents this decade have sought Western military and technological secrets with great success, and Hungarian agents ran a spy network within United States Army installations in Europe that acquired some of NATO's most tightly held war plans.
Much, if not all of that information was sold or given to the Soviets. ''Obviously, these are still countries that had their own interests, but historically the K.G.B. could get access to just about anything they wanted,'' said W. Douglas Gow, the F.B.I.'s new assistant director for counterintelligence.
 
Change Is Unlikely Soon
Mr. Gow and others say they anticipate some easing of the K.G.B.'s grip, but few expect serious change soon. For one thing, they said, the new civilian rulers in some nations - playwrights, coal miners, exiles - are probably too naive or too consumed by economic problems to worry about spying.
''We've often found that changes have taken place in the East bloc countries without any similar changes taking place in those countries' foreign-intelligence-gathering networks,'' said John C. Whitehead, Deputy Secretary of State in the Reagan Administration. ''That's not because the new governments wanted to keep the networks in business, but simply because the new people in office didn't know what was going on in their own services.''
In any case, friends of the Soviet Government appear to control most spying outright through the interior ministries, which generally manage the domestic secret police and espionage.
For example, Poland's Solidarity leadership conceded the Interior Ministry to Communists in what some American officials called a tacit agreement with Mr. Gorbachev to allow a peaceful transfer to democracy.
 
Intelligence in East Berlin
East Germany abolished its Ministry for State Security and its hated secret police, but re-established an intelligence service that will report to Prime Minister Hans Modrow, a Gorbachev favorite.
''No one will be so naive as to think that our country is the only one in the world that can do without intelligence service reconnaissance abroad,'' the East Berlin newspaper National-Zeitung said two weeks ago.
Even in Czechoslovakia, where the Interior Ministry has been moved from Communist control to a troika that includes two leaders of the opposition, American officials say they see no change so far.
Other East bloc nations are likely to feel the same need to spy on the West as long as a vestige of the cold war remains, some experts noted. Zdzislaw M. Rurarz, a former Polish diplomat who defected to the United States in 1981, noted pointedly in an interview that the United States was undoubtedly continuing to spy on the Solidarity-run Government there.
It would be foolish, he said, to expect the Poles not to reciprocate.
 
Two Question Marks
The two question marks are Hungary and Rumania, American officials say. In Rumania, it is unclear whether the Communist or anti-Communist factions of the ruling Council of National Salvation will gain the upper hand, but hatred of Communism runs so deep that many experts doubt that the Communists will prevail.
Hungary's intelligence directorate is Communist-run, but the state has dismantled the Communist Party bureaucracy, leaving it in civilian control. The United States has also warned Hungary that thefts of American technology will kill plans to ease curbs on the legal export of those technologies.
''The Hungarians seem further along than anybody,'' one official said, and have even offered to help prevent the leak of sensitive technologies to hostile countries.
In an apparent bow to American intelligence concerns, Hungary's new Government this fall deported Edward Lee Howard, a turncoat C.I.A. agent who in 1985 helped the K.G.B. destroy much of the agency's Moscow espionage network. The Hungarians have denied deporting Mr. Howard, but American officials confirmed a Los Angeles Times report of the action. 'Net Loss' for the K.G.B. How deeply the K.G.B. will be hurt by the East bloc changes looms as the biggest unanswered question of all.
Roy Godson, head of the Washington-based National Strategy Information Center and a well-known intelligence scholar, called any democratic change ''a net loss'' for Soviet intelligence. But he cautioned against euphoria.
''The Soviets wouldn't have relied on just official cooperation,'' he said. ''It would be surprising if they haven't unilaterally penetrated friendly services with their own agents, too.''
