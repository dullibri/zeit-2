HEADLINE: Fuel From Waste, Poised at a Milestone

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- For years, scientists and engineers have been juggling various combinations of acids, steam, bacteria, catalysts and the digestive juices of microorganisms to convert agricultural waste and even household garbage into motor fuel.
So far, such alternative fuels have not moved beyond small pilot plants, despite federal incentives to encourage companies to develop them.
But that could be about to change.
Officials at two companies that have built multimillion-dollar factories say they are very close to beginning large-scale, commercial production of these so-called cellulosic biofuels, and others are predicting success in the months to come. 
In Columbus, Miss., KiOR has spent more than $200 million on a plant that is supposed to mix shredded wood waste with a patented catalyst, powdered to talcumlike consistency. Its process does in a few seconds what takes nature millions of years: removes the oxygen from the biomass and converts the other main ingredients, hydrogen and carbon, into molecules that can then be processed into gasoline and diesel fuel.
KiOR aims to turn out 13 million gallons of fuel a year and has already lined up three companies to buy its output, including FedEx and a joint venture of Weyerhauser and Chevron. KiOR said on Thursday that it had begun producing what it called ''renewable crude'' and intended to refine that into gasoline and diesel that it would begin shipping by the end of the month.
And Ineos, a European oil and chemical company, is putting the final touches on a plant in Vero Beach, Fla., that would cook wood and woody garbage until they broke down into tiny molecules of hydrogen and carbon monoxide. Those molecules would be pumped into a giant steel tank, where bacteria would eat them and excrete ethanol. The company has spent $130 million on the plant, which is supposed to make eight million gallons a year, about 1 percent of Florida's ethanol demand. The plant is next to a county landfill, and executives covet the incoming garbage.
Both plants are far smaller than typical oil refineries, but commercial production at either one -- or at any of several of the plants that are a step behind them -- would be a major milestone in renewable energy.
At such plants, the goal is sometimes to make ethanol and sometimes gasoline or diesel fuel or their ingredients. The pathways to make the biofuels are varied. But the feedstocks have something in common: they are derived from plants and trees, but not from food crops like corn kernels, which are the basis of most of the biofuel currently made in the United States.
Often, the raw ingredients for the cellulosic biofuels are the wastes of farms, paper mills or households, with a value that is low or even negative, meaning people will pay the fuel producers to dispose of them. And the companies developing the new fuels say that their products produce far fewer carbon emissions than petroleum-based gasoline and diesel.
KiOR says that its fuel will release one-sixth the amount of carbon dioxide as an equivalent amount of petroleum fuel. That is mostly because every tree or woody plant fed into its process will eventually be replaced by a new tree or plant, which will suck carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. And a byproduct of its factory is surplus electricity, which will be exported to the grid, displacing electricity that would otherwise be generated from natural gas or coal.
Ineos goes a step further, saying its production process actually reduces the overall amount of carbon in the atmosphere. ''We could make the argument that we're carbon-negative,'' said Peter Williams, the chief executive. The reason, he said, is that electricity produced from its plant averts emissions that would have come from other electricity sources.
Just becoming the first company to produce commercial volumes of these alternative biofuels is no guarantee of commercial success. That depends on further optimizing production processes to get more gallons of fuel per ton of raw materials at lower operating costs.
Industry officials say that profits also depend on continued high prices for oil, the commodity that biofuels would replace, and a continuation of a federal government mandate that requires fuel blenders to mix a certain percentage of biofuels into the gasoline sold at service stations.
''Sustainability requires good economics,'' Mr. Williams said.
Many companies have produced biofuel successfully, but only in quantities characteristic of a factory that makes fine whisky or perhaps perfume. The trick is to get reliability up and costs down to a level that allows operation on a large scale.
Government policy has anticipated far more technical progress than the industry has made. Congress set a goal of 250 million gallons of cellulosic biofuel for 2011 and 500 million gallons for this year, but the Environmental Protection Agency cut the requirement to six million gallons for 2012 because of the lack of commercial production.
Six governors, oil refiners and companies hurt by high corn prices have asked the agency to waive its requirements for ethanol and other renewable fuels. Some single out the corn ethanol mandate, but others want the quota for cellulosic fuels waived, too, partly because there is no actual production.
The cellulosic biofuel industry has asked the E.P.A. to keep all the rules intact. Waiving the rule for corn ethanol would discourage investment in advanced biofuels as well, said Brent Erickson, a spokesman for BIO, a trade organization. ''You can't de-link them,'' he said.
The agency was expected to rule on Tuesday, but instead said it would rule ''shortly.'' To grant the waiver, it would have to find severe harm to the economy. Energy experts say that eventually renewable motor fuel could have a much bigger impact on the United States economy than renewable electricity from wind farms or solar cells. Renewable electricity saves coal and natural gas, which are cheap and domestically plentiful. Renewable motor fuel displaces oil, which is much more expensive and often imported, which poses a host of national security and trade issues.
If either Ineos or KiOR began commercial production, it would break a long string of overly optimistic promises made by the industry and the government.
In October 1998, for example, the Energy Department showed off a plant in Jennings, La., that made ethanol from sugar cane wastes; the department said it would reach commercial production within a few years. At the time the plant was owned by a government-subsidized firm called BC International, which was later reorganized and renamed Celunol. Then it was taken over by Verenium, which, with backing from BP, tried another method. BP announced on Oct. 25 that it was dropping plans for a commercial plant based on technology piloted at Jennings, although it still does research there.
Mascoma, based in Cambridge, Mass., and backed by General Motors and Khosla Ventures, among others, is trying to make ethanol from wood waste. Samir Kaul, a board member representing Khosla, confidently predicted in 2006 that it would be in commercial production by 2008, but that goal remains elusive.
Iogen, an established Canadian producer of enzymes, began producing ethanol from wheat straw in 2004, and said in the fall of 2005 that it hoped to announce plans for a commercial plant by the end of that year. Eventually, it announced plans for a plant in southern Manitoba, but in April of this year it dropped that idea, and laid off some workers at its Ottawa headquarters.
But new chemistry technology, like hope, springs eternal.
POET, a major producer of ethanol by conventional means, is building a plant in Emmetsburg, Iowa, that is supposed to digest 700 tons of corn cobs a day and feed the resulting sugars into a conventional ethanol plant next door. The goal of the project, which is supposed to be ready by late 2013, is to produce 20 million gallons of cellulosic ethanol a year.
Abengoa, a Spanish firm, has been running a pilot plant in Salamanca, Spain, and in June 2011, broke ground on a $350 million commercial plant in Hugoton, Kan., that is now 50 percent complete, according to Manuel Sanchez Ortega, the chief executive. It is currently slated to open in the third quarter of next year and is supposed to make 25 million gallons of ethanol a year from agricultural waste, wood waste and nonfood crops.
And a variety of smaller companies are a step behind.
The holy grail is to find a way to profitably make renewable fuels from otherwise wasted biomass, as opposed to valuable food crops.
''If we can do it with biomass, then there is no more discussion of food versus fuel; it's over,'' Mr. Ortega said.

HEADLINE: A Market In Emissions Is Set to Open In California

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER

 BODY:
SAN FRANCISCO -- California's fledging market-based system for reducing greenhouse gas emissions makes its formal debut on Wednesday with its auction of state-issued pollution allowances. 
More than six years in the making, the state's so-called cap-and-trade program sets limits on carbon dioxide emissions for virtually all sectors of California's economy, the ninth-largest in the world. Emissions allowances are allotted to polluters, and companies whose emissions exceed their allocations must either obtain extra allowances or buy credits from projects that cut greenhouse gas emissions.
Almost all of the 23.1 million allowances that California has given out to utilities and industry for complying with the program in 2013 have been free; the auction will measure how they are actually valued by the market. Some 39.5 million allowances covering emissions in 2015 will also be on sale Wednesday.
Sealed bids can be submitted over the Internet in the three-hour auction, with the results to be announced on Monday.
Depending on who is talking, the auction is a historic threshold in slowing climate change, or economic self-immolation that will cause refiners, cement makers or other companies to flee.
At one time, California's cap-and-trade system, mandated by a 2006 state law, seemed a likely blueprint for a national system.
That possibility receded when federal cap-and-trade legislation died in Congress in 2010. Still, Northeastern and mid-Atlantic states are experimenting with a far more modest system that they cast as a success, even though its allowances are trading at or below minimum price.
The world's biggest cap-and-trade program for greenhouse gases, pioneered by the European Union, has struggled with a chronic oversupply of carbon allowances and sagging prices. Backers of California's experiment -- like Gary Gero, the president of the state's Climate Action Reserve, a nonprofit group that tracks greenhouse gas emissions -- express optimism about its prospects. ''We're not creating a market for a market's sake,'' he said. ''We're creating a market for addressing the serious threat of global climate change.''
The total carbon allowances distributed in California will gradually decline over the years, forcing more emissions cuts.
As California's market gears up, each business must decide whether it is more cost-efficient to reduce its emissions or buy excess allowances from other companies that do not need them.
Gino DiCaro, a spokesman for the AB32 Implementation Group, an industry alliance whose name refers to the climate change law, warned that the auction would ''extract billions of dollars from the industrial sector and our high-wage employers.''
Also, the California Chamber of Commerce filed an 11th-hour suit Tuesday to stop the auction.

HEADLINE: Energy Independence in the United States? Don't Pop the Cork Yet

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

 BODY:
HOUSTON
EVER since the Arab oil embargoes in the 1960s and 1970s, American presidents have pledged to end the country's dependence on foreign oil by drilling more at home and increasing energy efficiency. But ''energy independence'' was little more than a dreamy campaign slogan.
Now, suddenly, the dream looks to be in reach. The International Energy Agency reported this week that the United States was poised to become the world's biggest oil producer thanks to new drilling technologies in shale fields across the country. With oil production going up each month, not only are imports from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries going to drop, the energy agency predicted, but the United States will also become a net oil exporter by 2030. 
At first look, the changing energy panorama seems implausibly fortuitous, and it is no doubt a strategic game-changer. But the report also warns that the global energy future is still full of challenges, and many energy experts say any celebrations should remain muted.
Even if the United States were no longer dependent on oil from the tumultuous Middle East and North Africa, vital American trading partners like China, India, Japan and Europe would continue to import increasing amounts of oil from the region. Future price shocks at the pump would still be likely as long as the world depended on unsteady producing nations like Venezuela, Nigeria, Iraq, Libya and Iran, where politics often mixes inharmoniously with crude.
''This isn't the end of history,'' said Michael Makovsky, a Pentagon official in the George W. Bush administration. ''If we are going to be a consumer of oil, it's better that it be our oil rather than from the Middle East. But the oil market is still global, and the North American oil market will still be greatly impacted by developments in the Middle East.''
It may go without saying, but burning American oil rather than Saudi oil brings few environmental advantages. Greenhouse gas emissions from the burning of fossil fuels, which will continue to dominate the energy landscape for decades, will raise global temperatures several degrees in the years ahead, according to the energy agency. Water constraints will threaten the sustainability of energy-generating projects, like oil drilling and expanding the production of biofuels, in the United States and abroad.
And even though more American oil production will improve the country's balance of trade and produce jobs, it will not necessarily ease the tight global oil market. That is because even as rigs and pumps in the United States are producing more, oil production is now falling in the North Sea, Mexico and Venezuela. And mounting consumption of oil in Saudi Arabia and other producing countries that subsidize energy to keep domestic tranquillity is leaving less oil for export.
Nevertheless, to some, the report may offer the tantalizing prospect that American security ties to the Middle East might loosen. If the United States can surpass Saudi Arabian and Russian oil production before the end of the decade and decrease its thirst for energy by producing more fuel-efficient cars, as the agency report projects, it is arguable that future American military interventions in the Persian Gulf region would be less likely.
Why would the United States protect Kuwaiti tankers from Iranian attack, as the Reagan administration did in the late 1980s? Or fight Iraq over an invasion of Kuwait, as the first Bush administration did in the early 1990s?
Why would the Fifth Fleet, now based in Bahrain to patrol the Persian Gulf area, have to exist if the United States got all of its oil from shale fields in North Dakota and Texas and the Arctic coast of Alaska?
Unfortunately, energy and foreign policy experts say, the United States would still need to worry about the Middle East since oil prices are set globally and much of the oil traded on world markets is produced by countries like Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Iran.
The energy agency report projects that oil demand in China and India will grow considerably in the decades ahead and that Europe will remain thirsty for energy. That means oil shipments through the Suez Canal will increase, according to the report, as Egypt's future stability remains in question.
More ominous, perhaps, will be the continued global dependence on the Straits of Hormuz -- now a flash point between the United States and Iran, and historically an area of dispute between Saudi Arabia and Iran. The agency report estimated that the amount of oil passing through that narrow waterway would increase to 25 million barrels a day in 2035, or 50 percent of the global oil trade, from 18 million barrels a day in 2010, or 42 percent of the trade.
A disruption of the Straits of Hormuz would be disastrous for the economies of China, India and Japan, and it would probably spark a global recession if the blockage lasted for months. The United States could not insulate itself from the damage to its trading partners.
''We're still going to need to protect the sea lanes,'' said David L. Goldwyn, who served as the State Department's coordinator for international energy affairs in the Obama administration. ''The rise in domestic production will not diminish in any way the need for the U.S. to retain global reach, particularly in the Middle East.''

HEADLINE: Money Fund Reform Has Top Support

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- A council of top financial regulators, upset with the Securities and Exchange Commission for failing to strengthen rules governing money market mutual funds since the financial crisis, is trying to force the S.E.C. to adopt stricter regulations.
The Financial Stability Oversight Council, a group of 10 regulators that includes the S.E.C. chairwoman, voted Tuesday to offer three distinct alternatives and said it would recommend one or a combination of those to the S.E.C. for adoption. 
The options, which mirror recent changes that failed to gain enough support to pass the five-member commission, include having money funds establish a floating net asset value, replacing the steady $1-a-share price that funds use now, or forcing the funds to set aside more cash to absorb possible losses in the value of its holdings.
If the S.E.C. does not follow through on the council's proposals, officials said, the council could draw on other powers to impose its own tougher oversight on the mutual fund companies and banks that sell money market funds publicly or on the funds themselves.
The action Tuesday was the strongest instance yet of the council flexing the considerable muscle given to it by the Dodd-Frank Act, the financial regulatory overhaul enacted in 2010 after the financial crisis. The council, a centerpiece of the act, is led by the Treasury secretary and includes the chief regulators for the banking, housing finance, securities and consumer finance industries.
Efforts by Mary L. Schapiro, the S.E.C. chairwoman, to enact tougher rules on money market funds stalled last August after heavy lobbying by the industry. Three of the S.E.C.'s five commissioners had indicated that they would oppose the proposed rules.
But Timothy F. Geithner, the Treasury secretary, has consistently favored the tightened rules that Ms. Schapiro was advocating, and he persuaded the oversight board to leverage its new powers to push the S.E.C. to act.
Regulators were prompted to strengthen the rules governing money market funds after one of the largest funds, the $62 billion Reserve Primary fund, suffered significant losses on its investments in Lehman Brothers debt when Lehman failed in 2008.
The Reserve Primary fund ''broke the buck,'' meaning its net asset value fell significantly below the $1 a share that it was required to maintain. That failure prompted a run on money market funds, with investors withdrawing more than $300 billion in short order.
The panic caused the market for short-term loans between companies, known as commercial paper, to shut down even for the most financially secure companies. The Treasury Department stepped in to guarantee more than $3 trillion in money-fund assets, and the Federal Reserve devised liquidity programs to shore up the financial markets.
''At the time, there was no formal council of regulators tasked with searching for risks that could cascade throughout the financial system and harm our economy,'' Ms. Schapiro said Tuesday before the council voted on the proposal. ''With the creation of the Financial Stability Oversight Council, we are jointly committed to taking the actions necessary -- and making the tough calls required -- to avoid the type of financial collapse that this nation experienced in the fall of 2008.''
Mutual fund industry officials, who have been offering their own proposals, immediately expressed disapproval of the action. ''It's deeply disappointing that the council has proceeded without giving due weight to the views of fund sponsors, investors and the issuers who depend upon money market funds for vital financing,'' said F. William McNabb III, chief executive of Vanguard and head of an industry money market funds group.
The council's recommendation presents three alternatives, and officials said the council might adopt one, a combination of any of the three, or all or parts of other plans that have been offered by the mutual fund industry and others.
One action would require money funds to have a floating net asset value, or share price, instead of their current fixed price, an option that Ms. Schapiro called ''the pure option, the simplest option, and the option that is most consistent with the S.E.C.'s regulatory approach to investment products.''
Another option would allow a $1 price but require funds to have a buffer of 1 percent of assets to absorb day-to-day fluctuations in the value of a fund's investments; in addition, it would permit investors with more than $100,000 in a fund to withdraw only 97 percent of their assets immediately. The rest would be first in line to absorb the fund's losses, thus discouraging redemptions.
A third proposal would require funds to have a buffer of 3 percent to absorb losses.
The oversight council will accept public comments on the proposals for 60 days beginning once the proposals are printed in the Federal Register, a process that takes several days.
Only the S.E.C. can enact regulations on money market funds. But if it fails to heed a council recommendation, the oversight group could designate individual funds or fund companies as ''systemically important,'' making them subject to even tougher oversight by regulators.
The council's action was applauded by advocates for tougher financial regulation, including Sheila C. Bair, the former chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, who now oversees the Systemic Risk Council, a nonpartisan group formed by the Pew Charitable Trusts.
''Never again should policy makers be forced to choose between a financial meltdown or a taxpayer bailout of money market funds,'' Ms. Bair said. ''I hope the Securities and Exchange Commission will recognize the risks posed by these products and implement the needed reforms.''

HEADLINE: A Michigan City Bets On Food for Its Growth

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER

 BODY:
GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. -- The idea of building a year-round public market to tie the city's skilled chefs to the region's big complement of young farmers had already attained an air of inevitability by the time this Midwestern city held its first Restaurant Week three summers ago.
Next year, just in time for the fourth annual Restaurant Week, Grand Rapids is scheduled to open the $30 million, 130,000-square-foot Downtown Market, a destination that is expected to attract 500,000 visitors a year. The three-story brick and glass building, under construction in a neighborhood of vacant turn-of-the-20th century warehouses, is intended by its developers to be a state-of-the art center of commerce for the culinary arts and fresh local foods.
It is also seen as having the potential to accomplish much more. 
''This project fills a variety of needs,'' said David Frey, chairman of the Frey Foundation and co-chairman of Grand Action, a nonprofit group of local business leaders that joined the city's Downtown Development Authority to raise money for the market and to build it. ''It creates a lot of synergy for the development that's been happening in Grand Rapids for some time now.''
The Downtown Market, in effect, is the newest piece of civic equipment built here since the mid-1990s to leverage the same urban economic trends of the 21st century -- higher education, hospitals and health care, housing, entertainment, transit, and cleaner air and water -- that are reviving most large American cities.
Few small cities, and possibly none in the industrial Midwest, have been nearly as successful. One reason is the distinctive partnerships formed between this city's redevelopment agencies and wealthy industrialists and philanthropists. Hundreds of millions of private dollars have been raised here to build a downtown that encourages entrepreneurs, develops career-track jobs and attracts new residents.
The civic projects built in the urban core by public-private partnerships since 1996 include the 12,000-seat Van Andel Arena, the $60 million new home for the Grand Rapids Art Museum, the $220 million DeVos Place convention center, $1 billion in hospitals and the new headquarters of the Michigan State University College of Human Medicine, several parks and the downtown campus of Grand Valley State University.
This small city, Michigan's second-largest behind Detroit, was floundering a generation ago with a shrinking and aging population and poor job prospects for young people.
But it has been transformed. Today, Grand Rapids is full of young professionals in good careers, who enjoy a low cost of living, first-rate restaurants with locally brewed beer and a variety of residential options near work. The population has rebounded to nearly 190,000, from a post World War II low of 181,000 in 1980, and the region's jobless rate fell to 6.7 percent in September, 1.8 percentage points below a year ago and well below the state rate of 9.3 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
''One of the elements that serves what we're doing here is to build pedestrian corridors downtown,'' said Mike VanGessel, president and chief executive of Rockford Construction. Rockford has invested more than $60 million to convert 13 mostly vacant warehouses and office buildings near the Downtown Market into 400,000 square feet of residential, retail and office space. One of the projects is GRid 70, a four-story office building a few blocks north of the market, where top designers for the region's sport shoe and office furniture manufacturers work.
''The people this city attracts now want to be near things,'' Mr. VanGessel said. ''They want to walk, not drive. The Downtown Market is close. It's part of the answer to, 'How do we keep doing the next right thing for retaining our talent?' ''
It turned out that the next right thing was to focus on fresh local food. Like hundreds of other cities, Grand Rapids has an outdoor seasonal farmers market that operates on Fulton Street four days a week. The Downtown Market fills what city leaders saw as a different need -- a year-round, seven-days-a-week public market that would be a place to shop for local foods and a destination for residents and visitors.
The Downtown Development Authority and Grand Action looked to Boston's Faneuil Hall, the market in Grand Central Station in New York, the Ferry Building in San Francisco, and Detroit's Eastern Market as institutions that encouraged commerce and civic spirit by acting as urban squares. Good local food set the table, so to speak.
The design plan for the Downtown Market includes space for food production and processing, a commercial kitchen to provide an incubator for new businesses and another to educate students in food preparation and healthful eating. A greenhouse will occupy the roof and two restaurants are planned. Enough space is available indoors and out for banquets, civic events and more than 60 vendors. The market was built with nontoxic materials, and has advanced systems for energy efficiency, natural lighting, waste management, recycling and water conservation.
A feasibility study, completed in March 2010 by Market Ventures of Portland, Me., found ample reason for Grand Rapids to pursue the project. Some 12,220 farms in the 11-county agricultural region that surrounds Grand Rapids bring in a total of $2 billion in annual revenue. Many of the growers produce fruits and vegetables, including specialty crops, for sale at a public market.
The study forecast that the Downtown Market, which occupies a 3.5-acre site close to highway exits and the Grand River, would achieve gross annual sales around $25 million, and generate more than 600 jobs. A small staff could manage the market, and its annual income is expected to total $2 million, with expenses reaching $1.5 million.
One measure of the market's popularity is that nearly 8,000 people have already signed on to a Facebook page supporting the market that was posted by an enthusiastic resident. Another measure of its visibility is that developers are adding 312 apartments, and 33,000 square feet of retail space in 13 new and renovated buildings in the neighborhoods closest to the Downtown Market, according to city figures.
The city's transit agency plans to build a $39.8 million rapid transit bus line, Michigan's first, the agency said. The line, with dedicated lanes and station stops, is intended to transport passengers from the suburbs to downtown much faster than an ordinary city bus route. Construction starts next year and a station stop is planned on Division Avenue, one block from the market.
Mimi Fritz, the market's new executive director, is hiring five staff members and developing a mix of local farmers, businesses, restaurants and programs to inhabit the building.
''It has to be good, feel authentic and develop into a distinctly Grand Rapids experience,'' she said.
Helping with those choices is Chris Muller, president of M Retail Solutions and a specialist in developing public markets. ''We are being careful and selective about what goes in the market,'' he said. ''People will come if it's a pretty cool platform for food.''

HEADLINE: Virginia Tries to Circumvent Obama to Allow Energy Drilling

BYLINE: By ALISON FITZGERALD

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- When Doug Domenech looks out at the Atlantic Ocean, he sees oil and natural gas and jobs and revenue. Standing between him and those prizes are President Obama, the Navy and whales.
Mr. Domenech, Virginia's secretary of natural resources, is undeterred. He and the state's Republican governor, Bob McDonnell, have teamed up with Virginia's two Democratic senators to try to do an end run around the president and put Virginia's coast on the energy map through an act of Congress.
The state is trying to restore a lease sale for energy exploration that was canceled in 2010 after the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Its efforts have made Virginia the new epicenter of a campaign by energy companies to gain a toehold in the potentially vast resources hidden beneath the Atlantic.
''The administration not only took away our sale, but they didn't reinstate it into the next five-year plan. They booted us off to 2017,'' Mr. Domenech said. ''That's what made us start pursuing other avenues in Congress.'' 
Oil companies and government officials think there is oil and natural gas off the East Coast. Exploration, however, has been blocked for more than 30 years after a devastating spill off the coast of California turned public opinion against offshore drilling.
That political environment changed over the last decade as oil prices soared and the American public and politicians weighed their fears of offshore drilling against the geopolitical threat of being dependent on oil from hostile nations or unstable regions.
Now seven companies, including Global Geo Services of Houston and WesternGeco, a subsidiary of Schlumberger, have applied for permission to conduct seismic studies along the East Coast from New Jersey all the way to Florida. Efforts are focusing on Virginia because the public, politicians in both parties and energy companies all favor opening the waters to drilling.
To proceed, the would-be explorers will need to bypass the vocal opposition of those who say that even the preliminary survey work would harm endangered whales, and of the Navy, which uses the waters off Virginia as training grounds for its base in Norfolk.
''It's an important frontier, and it's right next to a large market,'' said Joe Gagliardi, vice president for marine programs at Ion Geophysical, a company in Houston that has applied to spend six months conducting two-dimensional seismic surveys from New Jersey to Florida. ''The Eastern Seaboard market is huge.''
The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management estimates that there are 3.3 billion barrels of recoverable oil on the Atlantic's outer continental shelf and 31.3 trillion cubic feet, or 886.3 million cubic meters, of natural gas. The estimates are based on two-dimensional seismic surveys that were done in the early 1980s.
While they are careful to say that they have no idea what energy resources might be hidden beneath the Atlantic, energy executives say they believe that the bureau's estimates are low, noting the industry's history in the gulf.
''Initial estimates in the gulf were five billion barrels of oil,'' said Andy Radford, senior policy adviser at the American Petroleum Institute. ''We've already produced over 20 billion, and current estimates are that there are 48 billion more.''
There are other indicators that drilling there could lead to big discoveries.
''We know there are oil seeps all along the East Coast of the U.S.,'' Mr. Gagliardi said. ''Naturally the earth is leaking oil on a daily basis. There's a natural petroleum system out there.''
The Eastern Seaboard of the United States was once connected to the coast of West Africa before the continent split in two and the pieces drifted apart, creating the Atlantic Ocean. Nigeria alone has more than 37 billion barrels of proven reserves, much of it off the coast in deep water.
Tullow Oil, a company working on the same theory, struck oil last year off the coast of French Guiana. The company, which is based in London, said it had begun exploring in the area because it thought the geology mirrored its earlier successful discoveries across the ocean off the coast of West Africa.
''I personally believe that the East Coast of the U.S. does have the ability to be the prolific economic basin,'' Mr. Gagliardi said. ''However, there's such a huge data gap that even the government doesn't know the potential of the East Coast.''
Virginia was on the verge of becoming the Atlantic's drilling pioneer when, in March 2010, Mr. Obama announced he would offer mineral leases in a triangle of 2.9 million acres off the state's coast.
A month later, the oil rig Deepwater Horizon, working for BP, sank in a fiery blaze in the Gulf of Mexico, and oil leaked for months. Mr. Obama halted all new drilling in the gulf and all new lease sales everywhere else.
When Mr. Obama finally proposed his new five-year drilling plan in November 2011, Virginia was not included.
That is when the battle turned to Capitol Hill. The Republican-controlled House passed a bill that would order the ocean bureau to start selling oil leases off the coasts of Virginia and South Carolina.
Virginia's two Democratic senators, Mark Warner and Jim Webb, made their own proposal to direct the Interior Department to begin lease sales in an expanded area off Virginia and to give the state a share in the revenue.
''At this point we feel that Congressionally directed is better because that's where you get the revenue-sharing and the lease sales,'' said Mark Brunner, Mr. Warner's senior energy policy adviser.
Even if that law were passed, oil companies would then face the Navy, and whales.
Virginia is home to Naval Station Norfolk, the world's largest naval base, with 75 ships and 134 aircraft. A February 2010 Defense Department report said oil drilling in the area off Virginia that had been designated for leasing would interfere with military operations. Mr. Brunner said the Navy would allow drilling on a case-by-case basis.
Advocates for marine mammals have written thousands of letters and testified at public hearings, arguing that seismic surveys of the outer continental shelf would hurt endangered whales. The tests are scheduled to begin early next year.
''Seismic exploration isn't just the prelude to something bad -- it is in itself an assault on our coasts and oceans,'' said Michael Jasny, a senior policy analyst at the Natural Resources Defense Council.
Geophysical surveyors blast high-powered air guns under water and record the sound as it bounces off the various layers under the earth's crust.
Mr. Gagliardi said the technology was used worldwide, including in the Gulf of Mexico and in the Arctic.
Even so, the underwater blasts can interfere with the whales' communication, threatening their ability to reach feeding and calving grounds, Mr. Jasny said.
''Imagine dynamite going off in your neighborhood every 10 seconds for weeks or months on end,'' he said.
The most recent surveys of the Atlantic are more than 30 years old, conducted in the early 1980s, just before Congress imposed a moratorium on drilling off the Atlantic and Pacific Coasts in 1981. In 1990, President George H. W. Bush augmented the Congressional action with an executive order of his own.
In July 2008, President George W. Bush lifted his father's ban. Congress ended the statutory moratorium three months later.
On Jan. 16, 2009, just days before he left the White House, President Bush released a five-year drilling plan that included three lease sales in the Atlantic. Mr. Obama withdrew that plan and released a new one a year later that included the Virginia sale. That was scuttled after the gulf oil spill.
''It's like looking at a bunch of Christmas gifts that are wrapped,'' Mr. Domenech said, speaking of the riches that might lie under the ocean bottom. ''They're a similar size to a box of chocolates that you received last year, same size and shape. But until you open it, you don't know what's in there.''

HEADLINE: Russia Sees New Benefits To Shale Oil Extraction

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER

 BODY:
TALLINSKY, RUSSIA -- For decades, a little-known Cold War technological race played out in the oil fields of the United States and Russia: a race not into space, but deep underground.
The superpowers were searching for a means of extracting oil and natural gas from highly impermeable geological formations like shale rock, a potentially abundant source of petroleum, as the shale boom in the United States today is showing.
The long U.S. struggle to unlock so-called tight rock deposits is well documented. The Soviet effort is less so, though it included, as in the United States, a secretive program that led to the detonation of a nuclear device in a tight rock formation, an engineering approach that ultimately failed.
The industry eventually settled on hydraulic fracturing -- the technique of pumping a gelatinous liquid made from the flour of guar into a well. Guar is a starchy grain that grows in India. Under high pressure, this pudding-like mixture opens up cracks to release the oil and natural gas trapped in the rock more efficiently than any bomb. 
Russia, the world's largest energy exporting nation, had set aside its efforts to extract oil and natural gas from tight rocks because it had other reservoirs that were easier to tap. But it is now again jumping back into the race to pump so-called unconventional oil deposits.
''They have a tremendous amount of oil in the ground that is very accessible,'' said Tom Reed, the chief financial officer for Ruspetro, an independent oil company that specializes in one type of challenging oil deposit in Siberia that stumped a generation of Soviet geologists.
The trick this time is not competition, but imitation. Oil service companies are importing technologies like fracturing for what some energy analysts say will become a shale oil boom in Russia to rival what has happened in North America.
''By necessity, Americans have gotten really good at squeezing the last drop of oil out of rock,'' said Mr. Reed, a Californian who got his start in business in Russia trading distressed debt in the 1990s.
The Russian government has until now viewed the spread of such technologies from the United States largely negatively, because of their implications for the European natural gas market: Large shale gas deposits in Poland and Ukraine threaten exports from Moscow-based Gazprom, one of the world's largest natural gas companies. Shale oil, in contrast, could be a boon for Russia.
Several oil companies operating in Russia, including Ruspetro, have begun profitably extracting oil from shale rock and other difficult geological formations in Siberia, holding out hope that the type of advanced drilling techniques used in recent years in North America can be widely adopted there, too.
In another sign of the buzz around shale oil in Russia, Exxon Mobil is in a joint venture agreement with Rosneft, the state oil company, to drill test wells into a Siberian shale oil field. Statoil and Shell, also through joint ventures, are drilling or plan test wells in Russian shale beds. Lukoil has a pilot shale project.
Later this year, the Russian government is expected to propose to Parliament a hefty tax break for companies producing offshore and from tight oil deposits. The biggest beneficiary will be Rosneft.
The tax break is intended to make shale oil production viable in Russia.
It is expected, for example, to allow Rosneft to reclassify tight oil reserves, including Siberian shale, as economically recoverable.
The additions could add 5 billion barrels to Rosneft's existing reserves of 23 billion barrels of oil.
Because of this anticipated revaluation of tight oil reserves in Russia, Bank of America Merrill Lynch has advised clients to buy Rosneft stock.
The U.S. Geological Survey estimates the overall supply of Russian shale oil in West Siberia at 80 to 140 billion barrels. Even a portion of that would add significantly to Russia's current conventional reserves of 67 billion barrels of oil.
There is one important distinction between the industries in the two countries. Small independent oil companies led the unconventional oil boom in the United States, reversing the decline in U.S. oil output that began in the 1970s as fields were tapped out, the stage Russia is entering today.
Companies like Anadarko, Apache or Chesapeake experimented with sites that larger companies considered too costly to produce. Over the years, costs dropped.
In the United States, a swarm of risk-taking, privately owned small enterprises produce about 50 percent of the of oil output, with the majors accounting for the rest.
Russia's independent sector is so small as to almost go unnoticed. Ruspetro, which pumps an unusual oil deposit in western Siberia known as a channel sand, listed shares on the London Stock Exchange in January and pitched investors on the idea of attracting a North American-style independent company to Siberia. Other small operators in Russia include Urals Energy, PetroNeft and Irkutsk Oil.
Ruspetro stock has slumped along with the Russian market since the company's initial public offering, but Ruspetro's oil output has grown steadily: it now pumps 6,100 barrels per day, up from little more than a thousand last year. Its proven reserves are 183 million barrels of oil; it has an operating loss today because of investment in new wells.
Above ground, the Ruspetro field is a flat and featureless place of cedar and birch forests, looping streams of muddy, icy water and peat bogs. The Khanty, a native people, sometimes hunt there.
But below ground, the field, according to the company co-founder, Don Wolcott, an authority on Siberian geology and the former senior vice president for Yukos oil company, resembles nothing so much as Texas.
The anvil-shaped license area was the mouth of a Jurassic river 145 million to 220 million years ago. It left sandbars on its bank that became sandstone reservoirs. Mr. Wolcott first saw the seismic maps of the area at an auction in Moscow and decided to buy the site on the spot -- later forming a company to do so -- based on his knowledge of new technical possibilities in the industry from having worked channel sand reservoirs in Texas.
Tapping these tricky deposits is a business that does not seem suited to the blunderbuss approach of the state giants.
Ruspetro is profitable when its geologists can successfully reimagine the meandering contours of the old river, which flowed in lazy oxbows and broad reaches toward an ancient sea.
The goal is to hit the sandstone ''lens'' deposits of curving former riverbank, with a well sunk from the featureless plain above. A well costs about $2 million.
''It's like William Tell shooting an apple off his son's head,'' said Mr. Reed, the chief financial officer, ''because the margin between success and disaster is tiny, it works best if the one who is aiming has a personal stake in the outcome.''
Russian state companies, meanwhile, have shown poor capital discipline. Gazprom's capital outlays in 2011, for example, were about $42 billion, producing the result of maintaining gas output at about the same level as the year before.
The Ruspetro license area also covers a part of the Bazhenov shale, an oil-saturated layer underneath much of western Siberia, about 30 meters or 90 feet thick. This is also the target of Exxon's pilot project with Rosneft. The Bazhenov is considered similar in its vast potential to the Bakken shale in North Dakota, perhaps the most successful U.S. oil shale patch. The Bazhenov, however, is far larger.
Ruspetro is now in negotiation with DeGolyer & MacNaughton, a reservoir appraisal company, to add up its reserves. Those figures could tell the market that Siberian shale oil is now real.
If a nuclear approach had worked, the market might have made this discovery years ago. Russia tried creating cracks by detonating nuclear explosives in a tight rock formation in the northern portion of European Russia, called the Timan-Pechora Basin, according to a history of the Russian oil industry, ''Wheel of Fortune,'' by Thane Gustafson. In total, the Soviet Ministry of Oil detonated 13 nuclear devices in oil fields under an experimental program.
The Soviet Union did use nuclear blasts successfully to shut in runaway gas wells, an idea the Obama administration specifically ruled out in 2010 during the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.
In the United States, a government project called Ploughshare, run partly out of what became known as the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, experimented with using nuclear blasts for civilian engineering purposes, and in 1967 it detonated a device underground in a shale rock natural gas reservoir at the Gasbuggy nuclear site in New Mexico, according to the Department of Energy.
Both Soviet and U.S. experiments with nuclear explosions in tight rock formations, were failures, irradiating the fuel or vitrifying the rocks.
Today all that separates Siberia from sharing in a North Dakota-style shale boom is government policy, Vyacheslav Bolshakov, the chief fracturing engineer at Ruspetro, said in an interview.
The technological toolbox for producing oil from shale -- horizontal drilling, hydraulic fracturing, computer seismic studies and other services and equipment -- is available on the oil services market. But without tax changes, costs would exceed the return on oil produced.
''We have everything we need right here in Russia,'' Mr. Bolshakov said, ''except for profit.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Natural Disasters Hinder Progress in Asia, Development Bank Says

BYLINE: By BETTINA WASSENER

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- Asia's rapid economic progress risks being undermined by the rising number of floods, landslides and other natural disasters that hit the region, according to a new report by the Asian Development Bank, published on Tuesday. 
Coming just two weeks after a massive storm battered the east coast of the United States, wreaking havoc in New York and surrounding areas, the development bank's study provided a stark reminder that Asia and its many densely populated and rapidly expanding coastal cities are particularly vulnerable to weather-related disasters such as storms and floods.
''The region has borne the brunt of the physical and economic damage of the sharp rise in natural disasters since the 1980s,'' the bank wrote. ''Its people are four times more likely to be affected by natural disaster than in Africa and 25 times more than in Europe or North America.''
Disaster-related losses could top $19 billion a year, and the increasing frequency and severity of natural disasters can ''slash economic growth and development,'' the report commented.
Weeks of flooding in low-lying areas of Thailand, for example, inundated homes and factories, paralyzed much the country's manufacturing sector and caused many billions of dollars in damages late last year.
Similarly, floods and landslides cost the China some $18 billion in 2010 alone, the bank said.
''We have thought for too long that natural disasters come and go, that they are just an interruption to development, and that they can be dealt with after they strike,'' commented Vinod Thomas, the director general of the Independent Evaluation department, which evaluates the policies and strategies of the A.D.B and compiled the report.
In developing Asia, rapid and often chaotic urbanization, poorly managed rural land use and deforestation exacerbate the impact of storms and rising sea levels.
In a bid to dull the impact of future disasters, more emphasis should be placed on disaster prevention, rather than post-disaster recovery, the study recommended. By some measures, the report said, ''one dollar invested today in reducing disaster risk saves at least four dollars in future relief and rehabilitation costs.''

HEADLINE: Defense Opens Insider Trade Case With Attack on Witnesses

BYLINE: By PETER LATTMAN

 BODY:
Jurors were presented with a stark choice in the insider trading trial of two former hedge fund managers. The defendants were either the senior links in a "corrupt chain" of Wall Street traders, or scapegoats for the criminal conduct of their subordinates.
On Tuesday, a jury heard opening arguments in the trial of Anthony Chiasson, a co-founder of the now-defunct Level Global Investors, and Todd Newman, a former portfolio manager of Diamondback Capital Management. They are accused of conspiring with six others to earn roughly $70 million from illegal trading in technology stocks. 
The other six defendants have pleaded guilty and are cooperating with the prosecution. Two of the six, Jesse Tortora, a former Diamondback analyst, and Spyridon Adondakis, who goes by Sam, a former analyst at LevelGlobal, are expected to be the government's main witnesses.
They "will paint a picture of a corrupt network of professionals who chose to break the rules and to trade on inside information all in order to make a quick buck," said Richard C. Tarlowe, a prosecutor.
Yet the defense spent much of Tuesday attacking the credibility of the government witnesses. "The biggest mistake Todd Newman ever made, and the reason he's sitting here today, is because he hired Jesse Tortora," Stephen Fishbein, a lawyer representing Mr. Newman, said in his opening statement.
"Sam Adondakis is an easy, practiced liar," said Reid H. Weingarten, a lawyer for Mr. Chiasson. "His word cannot be trusted."
Early this year, federal prosecutors in Manhattan charged the eight Wall Street traders with participating in a "tight-knit circle of greed" that relied on secret financial information provided to them by corporate insiders at the computer company Dell and the chip maker Nvidia.
The trial, in Federal District Court in Manhattan before Judge Richard J. Sullivan, is expected to last six weeks. If convicted, the defendants could be sentenced to at least 25 years in prison, though they probably would receive far less time.
On Tuesday, prosecutors described how confidential information moved "across a corrupt chain of people" and ultimately into the hands of Mr. Chiasson, 39, and Mr. Newman, 47. That information, Mr. Tarlowe said, gave the defendants "an unfair advantage over honest investors who were playing by the rules."
The prosecution previewed several pieces of evidence, including e-mails and instant messages among the defendants and their analysts. The communications, according to the government, suggest that in 2008 the managers had secret information about Dell's gross margin numbers, crucial figures in its earnings release. With access to those inside numbers, Level Global made $50 million and Diamondback about $2.8 million by betting against Dell stock before the company released its earnings, the prosecution said.
Lawyers for the defense spent much of their opening statements trying to distance their clients from those accused of being their co-conspirators.
Mr. Tortora and Mr. Adondakis, with a few of the other defendants, worked together earlier in their careers as technology industry analysts at Prudential Equity Group in San Francisco. Mr. Weingarten, a lawyer for Mr. Chiasson, said that the group referred to themselves as "the clique" and likened themselves to "Fight Club," a 1999 cult film about a secret, underground fight club.
"The first rule of the fight club is that there is no fight club," Mr. Weingarten said, paraphrasing a famous line from the movie.
The clique "traveled together, partied together, drank together, vacationed in the Hamptons together," he said. "They were very close, and they shared information as well."
But neither Mr. Chiasson nor Mr. Newman was part of this clique, and they were far removed from the original sources of inside information, their lawyers insisted. Instead, the two defendants were depicted as upstanding, hardworking portfolio managers whose investments were grounded in legitimate research.
Both defendants processed so much data over the course of a trading day, their lawyers said, that they would not have been aware of improperly obtained data. To underscore that point, lawyers for Mr. Newman showed the jury a slide highlighting how in a given year, Mr. Newman made 32,222 trades, or roughly 128 trades a day, in the stocks of 366 companies.
The defense lawyers said that Mr. Tortora and Mr. Adondakis had falsely accused their clients to protect themselves. In November 2010, Mr. Tortora had lost his job at Diamondback and was living in Florida. When F.B.I. agents knocked on his door and presented him with evidence of insider trading, his only way out was to help the government, Mr. Fishbein, Mr. Newman's lawyer, said.
"Make Todd Newman a scapegoat so Jesse Tortora does not have to face the consequences of crossing the line," said he said.
Mr. Weingarten urged the jury, which includes a dog walker and a retired postal worker, not to resent the extraordinary wealth of Mr. Chiasson, who is worth tens of millions of dollars.
"It's crazy how we pay people in our society," Mr. Weingarten said. He noted that his "beloved" New York Yankees paid Alex Rodriguez many millions of dollars a year, only to pinch-hit for him this year in the bottom of the ninth inning of a playoff game.
"In 2007, he made A-Rod kind of money," Mr. Weingarten said, referring to Mr. Chiasson. "I know you will not hold his economic success against him."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Riots Erupt Across Jordan Over Gas Prices

BYLINE: By JODI RUDOREN; An employee of The New York Times contributed reporting from Amman, Jordan.

 BODY:
JERUSALEM -- Violent protests broke out across Jordan on Tuesday night after the government announced an increase in fuel prices, inciting what appeared to be an unparalleled show of anger directed at the king after months of mounting tension in the strategically important and politically fragile kingdom.
Demonstrators burned tires, smashed traffic lights and blocked roads in several Jordanian cities. Riot police officers tried to quell some of the crowds with tear gas. There were calls for a general strike on Wednesday.
In Dhiban, a city of 15,000 south of the capital, Amman, protesters burned pictures of King Abdullah II, witnesses said. In Salt, which has been a site of popular discontent, protesters destroyed two cars outside the prime minister's home, which was empty. And in Amman, thousands of demonstrators filled the circle outside the Interior Ministry near midnight, chanting, ''The people want the fall of the regime,'' echoing similar chants in Egypt and Tunisia, where the Arab Spring began. 
''The anger and frustration from the people is at its peak all over the kingship,'' Murad Adailah, a member of the Muslim Brotherhood's political wing, Islamic Action Front, said from outside the Interior Ministry. ''This is unprecedented. The level of the slogans are the highest. This is the highest peak of tension that I've seen since the beginning of the Arab Spring.''
The eruption comes as King Abdullah has struggled to contain a growing and increasingly diverse opposition by introducing electoral reforms ahead of balloting scheduled for January and by establishing a constitutional court.
Critics have rejected these initiatives as half steps -- they complain that the court, for example, is neutered because the king appoints its judges -- and the monarchy has jailed dozens of activists on charges including incitement to change the Constitution and to overthrow the government, which can carry the death penalty. In October, the king dissolved Parliament and appointed Jordan's fourth prime minister in a year.
Facing a $3 billion deficit, attributed largely to the disappearance of financial aid from gulf states, the government tried to reduce fuel subsidies -- effectively raising prices -- by 10 percent in September, only to reverse itself a day later after thousands took to the streets. Late Tuesday, the cabinet again announced a drop in subsidies that would result in increases of 14 percent on prices at the pump and more than 50 percent in gas used for cooking, leading to what Mr. Adailah said were more than 100 demonstrations across the kingdom.
Jordan is an important ally of the United States, helping to preserve its peace treaty with Israel and offering crucial intelligence support in Iraq and on terrorism. But its stability has long been precarious, with its population of six million divided between Palestinian refugees and natives, known as East Bankers, and frequent spillover from the fighting across its borders in Iraq and Syria.
About 200,000 refugees from the civil war in Syria have flooded into the country in recent months, further taxing economic and natural resources. Jordan's divisions had for some time shielded it from the kind of unified opposition that brought down leaders in Egypt and Tunisia, but now, activists are saying, frustration has become a unifying force.
Nathan Thrall, an analyst with the International Crisis Group, a research organization that works to prevent conflicts, said that when the Arab Spring revolutions began in Tunisia, Libya and Egypt, he considered the chance of something similar happening in Jordan to be remote. Now, Mr. Thrall said, he and other experts see it as far more likely, if still a long shot.
''If people realize that things will develop in a negative way and they will not be able to make ends meet, they will take matters into their own hands,'' said Labib Kamhawi, a political activist and analyst who is scheduled to appear in court this month on charges of sedition, defamation, threatening national unity and disrespecting government institutions, based on comments he made on television in July. ''As things become more crucial and more challenging for the regime, the measures used will be tougher and more sinister.''
Zaki Bani Irsheid, vice chairman of the Muslim Brotherhood, long Jordan's leading opposition force, said in an interview before the latest flare of discontent that throughout the past two years his faction had expanded alliances with the extremists known as Salafists, unions and the loose-knit, largely secular protest movement known as the Hirak.
''Is the regime waiting for an explosion in Jordan so his end will be like the Egyptian end or the Tunisian end?'' Mr. Irsheid asked, referring to the king. ''We are insisting on creating the Jordanian spring with a Jordanian flavor, which means reforming our regime and keeping our Hirak peaceful.''
Samih al-Maitah, Jordan's minister of information -- also speaking before gas-price protests broke out -- made a parallel argument. ''The Arab Spring is not one model, it's not Mubarak in prison,'' he said, referring to Hosni Mubarak, the deposed Egyptian president. ''The Arab Spring gave us the opportunity to reform in Jordan. There were changes in the Constitution, new legislative laws and new elections that will open up the door for something more. There is success. Maybe not enough; we'll always want more.''
Among the new laws was one passed in September that the government said was needed to organize Jordan's robust online news industry, but that critics see as a crackdown on expression. The law requires Jordan's more than 400 news sites to register with the government, hire a member of the journalists' union as an editor, and keep reader comments on their servers for six months so they can be reviewed by the intelligence service. It also allows for lawsuits against both those who write comments and multiple editors for the content of the comments, which has led a dozen of the most independent sites to block reader feedback in recent weeks in protest.
''The comments give a spirit and soul to our articles, and some of them give very vital and important information,'' said Basil Okoor, who runs one of the sites, jo24.net, and heads a group of 60 of them fighting the law. ''It is a barometer. It could be a way to start to understand people, what makes them tick, and this is all in danger.''
Mr. Maitah, the information minister, said the online news industry had been ''good for Jordan,'' but that the law was needed ''to give it support for its ethics and its professionalism and to institutionalize it,'' particularly because ''people were using comments to insult people.''
But a coalition of unions, political organizations and civil society groups that formed this fall denounced the law as an ''outcast'' that ''puts Jordan on the list of authoritarian states that are hostile to Internet freedoms.''
Fadi Masamreh, 23, who reports on demonstrations for another of the news sites, Khabarjo, was arrested Sept. 12 at a sit-in at the Interior Ministry, and released along with 19 others on Oct. 24. The charges against him -- cursing the king, gathering illegally, inciting against the Constitution and the government -- are pending.
''The people will not be quiet,'' he said in an interview a few days after his release. ''Those who want to fight for change have to present sacrifices. If my arrest will be invested toward this change, I have no problem being in prison again 43 years, not 43 days.''

HEADLINE: Hospitals Ordered to Do More to Protect Kidney Donors

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK

 BODY:
ST. LOUIS -- Addressing long-held concerns about whether organ donors have adequate protections, the country's transplant regulators acted late Monday to require that hospitals thoroughly inform living kidney donors of the risks they face, fully evaluate their medical and psychological suitability, and then track their health for two years after donation.
Enactment of the policies by the United Network for Organ Sharing, which manages the transplant system under a federal contract, followed six years of halting development and debate. 
Meeting at a St. Louis hotel, the group's board voted to establish uniform minimum standards for a field long regarded as a medical and ethical Wild West. The organ network, whose initial purpose was to oversee donation from people who had just died, has struggled at times to keep pace with rapid developments in donations from the living.
''There is no question that this is a major development in living donor protection,'' said Dr. Christie P. Thomas, a nephrologist at the University of Iowa and the chairman of the network's living donor committee.
Yet some donor advocates complained that the measures did not go far enough, and argued that the organ network, in its mission to encourage transplants, has a conflict of interest when it comes to safeguarding donors.
Three years ago, the network issued some of the same policies as voluntary guidelines, only to have the Department of Health and Human Services insist they be made mandatory.
Although long-term data on the subject is scarce, few living kidney donors are thought to suffer lasting physical or psychological effects. Kidney donations, known as nephrectomies, are typically done laparoscopically these days through a series of small incisions. The typical patient may spend only a few nights in a hospital and feel largely recovered after several months.
Kidneys are by far the most transplanted organs, and there have been nearly as many living donors as deceased ones over the last decade. What data is available suggests that those with one kidney typically live as long as those with two, and that the risk of a donor dying during the procedure is roughly 3 in 10,000.
But kidney transplants, like all surgery, can sometimes end in catastrophe.
In May at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, a 41-year-old mother of three died when her aorta was accidentally cut during surgery to donate a kidney to her brother. In other recent isolated cases, patients have received donor kidneys infected with undetected H.I.V. or hepatitis C.
Less clear are any longer-term effects on donors. Research conducted by the United Network for Organ Sharing shows that of roughly 70,000 people who donated kidneys between late 1999 and early 2011, 27 died within two years of medical causes that may -- or may not -- have been related to donation. For a small number of donors, their remaining kidney failed, and they required dialysis or a transplant.
The number of living donors -- 5,770 in 2011 -- has dropped 10 percent over the last two years, possibly because the struggling economy has made it difficult for prospective donors to take time off from work to recuperate. With the national kidney waiting list now stretching past 94,000 people, and thousands on the list dying each year, transplant officials have said they must improve confidence in the system so more people will donate.
The average age of donors has been rising, posing additional medical risks. And new ethical questions have been raised by the emergence of paired kidney exchanges and transplant chains started by good Samaritans who give an organ to a stranger.
Brad Kornfeld, who donated a kidney to his father in 2004, told the board that it had been impossible to find good information about what to expect, leaving him to search for answers on unreliable Internet chat rooms. He said he had almost backed out.
''If information is power,'' said Mr. Kornfeld, a Coloradan who serves on the living donor committee, ''the lack of information is crippling.''
Under the policies approved this week, the organ network will require hospitals to collect medical data, including laboratory test results, on most living donors to study lasting effects. Results must be reported at six months, one year and two years.
Similar regulations have been in place since 2000, but they did not require blood and urine testing, and hospitals were allowed to report donors who could not be found as simply lost.
That happened often. In recent years, hospitals have submitted basic clinical information -- like whether donors were alive or dead -- for only 65 percent of donors and lab data for fewer than 40 percent, according to the organ network. Although the network holds the authority, no hospital has ever been seriously sanctioned for noncompliance.
''It's time we put some teeth into our policy,'' said Jill McMaster, a board member from Tennessee.
By 2015, transplant programs will have to report thorough clinical information on at least 80 percent of donors and lab results on at least 70 percent. The requirements phase in at lower levels for the next two years.
Dr. Stuart M. Flechner of the Cleveland Clinic, the chairman of a coalition of medical societies that made recommendations to the organ network, said 9 of 10 hospitals would currently not meet the new requirement.
Donna Luebke, a kidney donor from Ohio who once served on the organ network's board, said the new standards would matter only if enforcement were more rigorous. She noted that the organization was dominated by transplant doctors: ''UNOS is nothing but the foxes watching the henhouse,'' she said.
Another of the new regulations prescribes in detail the medical and psychological screenings that hospitals must conduct for potential donors. It requires automatic exclusion if the potential donor has diabetes, uncontrolled hypertension or H.I.V., among other conditions.
The new policies also require that hospitals appoint an independent advocate to counsel and represent donors, and that donors receive detailed information in advance about medical, psychological and financial risks.

HEADLINE: Staying Put on Wall Street, Even if Sodden

BYLINE: By C. J. HUGHES

 BODY:
More than two weeks after Hurricane Sandy came ashore in Manhattan, sending an 11-foot surge of seawater over much of the southern tip of the island, the financial district is still in tatters.
Dozens of office buildings that were flooded by the storm still lack power and are off-limits to tenants, and many streets are a chaotic mess of generators, work crews and pumps.
Still trying to gauge the extent of the damage, many landlords have been vague about when their buildings will reopen. And some tenants, who have been uprooted to tiny conference rooms in New Jersey or industrial spaces in Brooklyn, are weighing whether to come back to the neighborhood at all.
But despite the uncertainty and destruction, many analysts don't expect the bulk of tenants to pack up and leave for good, nor do they think that future tenants will rule out the neighborhood over fears they might get flooded. 
''I don't think it will become an overriding factor in the location decision,'' said John Wheeler, the head downtown broker for Jones Lang LaSalle, echoing other top brokers. ''I guess time will tell if I'm being too sanguine about this.''
Brokers add that the neighborhood remains a compelling place to locate a business. Even with some train lines hampered by storm damage, it is still amply served by mass transit, with ferry service and more than a dozen subway lines. The new apartments and condos built in recent years, along with new boutiques and restaurants, also mean that many people can now live a few blocks from their office.
Besides, rents are notably competitive with other business districts in Manhattan, at about $40 a square foot in the financial district, compared with $65 in Midtown, according to Cassidy Turley, the brokerage firm, though the downtown figure is expected to climb when the two new World Trade Center buildings come online.
Complicating the prognosis about the neighborhood's long-term health is the fact that getting an exact handle on the extent of damage has been tricky. Many major landlords have been reluctant to respond to even basic questions about the status of their buildings. And many brokers have refused to discuss individual properties.
While the city's Buildings Department declared early last week that nine downtown buildings were completely off-limits and another 445 were only partly habitable, it did not differentiate between commercial and residential structures.
Jones Lang LaSalle has been one of the few brokerage firms to tackle the issue. It concluded that a hefty 20 percent of all the major office buildings below Canal Street were closed, or 37 out of 183, according to data compiled as of Monday. And those shuttered buildings, most of which are east of Broadway, represent 29.2 million square feet of space, the data shows.
Anecdotal evidence, too, suggests the damage has been severe. Late last week, the Water Street corridor, which runs along the East River, appeared alarmingly hard-hit.
Men in white hazmat outfits pushed garbage bins on streets, which rumbled with the sounds of generators. Several traffic lights were still dark. Clumps of yellow hoses snaked up escalators and through lobbies. And security guards, protecting against looters, were more numerous than people wearing suits.
Among the buildings confirmed closed were 99 Wall Street, 199 Water Street, One Wall Street Plaza and 180 Maiden Lane. Others that appear to be closed include 55 Water Street, 85 Broad Street, 7 Hanover Square and 10 Hanover Square. Four New York Plaza, where The Daily News is based, could be closed for a year, though One New York Plaza, whose basement shopping center took on 30 feet of water, should reopen in two weeks, according to a spokeswoman for the building's landlord, Brookfield Office Properties.
Some tenants are concerned that floods will become a regular occurrence; just 15 months ago, the city was soaked by Tropical Storm Irene. These tenants say their fears were confirmed by comments that Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo made after Hurricane Sandy about how destructive weather events were likely to recur.
''He was like, 'If you don't believe in global warming, wake up and see what's happening here,' and he was right,'' said Andrea Katz, a development director for WBAI, the public radio station, which has a 10,000-square-foot space at 120 Wall Street. The lower floors of the Art Deco building, which is at South Street and owned by Silverstein Properties, were flooded by Hurricane Sandy.
Based in the building for 15 years, the station was paying a rent of ''around $30 or $40'' a square foot annually, Ms. Katz said, but it is now considering a permanent move somewhere else.
''If you can't broadcast because you're dead, that's a big deal,'' said Ms. Katz, whose apartment on nearby Fulton Street also lost heat and hot water for days. Silverstein didn't return several requests for comment.
Also mulling a relocation is Trina Byrd, a founder of Toussaint Capital Partners, a small investment bank whose office is a 4,000-square-foot space with a trading floor at 110 Wall Street near Front Street, owned by Rudin Management. Water breached its basement and lobby.
Since the storm hit, Ms. Byrd and her staff of 10 have been camped out in a conference room in Red Bank, N.J., that belongs to her lawyer, but they need to move soon. ''Right now we're just focused on the next three months, trying to find a bigger space,'' she said, ''but in the long run, a move out of the neighborhood might be a good idea.''
Yet the financial district still holds great appeal for the CGI Group, an information technology services company whose clients include the city Department of Education.
One of its offices, a 7,000-square-foot space at 90 Broad Street, is shuttered and probably will not reopen until December, said Linda Odorisio, a company spokeswoman.
In the meantime, about 20 of its employees have relocated to a raw 800-square-foot berth at the Brooklyn Army Terminal, which was made available through the city's Economic Development Corporation's ''Back to Business'' initiative. The program, began last week, offers rent-free temporary office space owned by the city as well as Muss Development, Forest City Ratner and Brookfield, and JPMorgan Chase, which owns several MetroTech buildings in Downtown Brooklyn.
Also, last week, the Real Estate Board of New York began compiling a list of spaces available for short-term stays, though most require rent. By last Friday, the list totaled 12 pages, up from six earlier in the week, though there have been few takers, according to a real estate board spokeswoman.
In that sense, CGI may represent the prevailing attitude downtown: to stay put. ''We have been in Lower Manhattan since the 1970s,'' Ms. Odorisio said. ''And we need to be where our clients are, so that's where we will continue to be.''
Even though the storm may prove to be a mere blip in the financial district's fortunes, it may change the way buildings are designed, said Steven Spinola, the real estate board's president.
In the future, generators may be removed from the basement and placed on higher floors, Mr. Spinola said. Other brokers mentioned that elevators could be made to stop at the second floor, and not the ground.
But unlike the 9/11 attacks -- the last major cataclysm in the area -- the recovery from the storm seems more manageable, Mr. Spinola said. ''With 9/11 we didn't know what to expect, and with this, it's not like we don't know where the end is,'' he said. ''We see the light at the end of the cleanup tunnel.''

HEADLINE: Occupy Wall St. Offshoot Aims to Erase People's Debts

BYLINE: By ARIEL KAMINER

 BODY:
A group of professors, documentary filmmakers, corporate dropouts and others had spent months protesting Americans' debt burden when a novel idea arose: What if they could just wave a magic wand and make some of it disappear?
The group, an offshoot of the Occupy Wall Street movement called Strike Debt, is trying to buy some of the debts that people have accrued -- which lenders often sell for pennies on the dollar to third parties who either try to collect on it or bundle it up for resale. Strike Debt, however, is not looking to collect on them; instead it plans to give some debtors the surprise of a lifetime.
''Basically what we're going to do is exactly the same as what a regular debt buyer would do, with one big difference,'' said Thomas Gokey, an artist and teacher. ''Rather than collect the debt, we're just going to abolish it.'' 
The group is holding a fund-raiser on Thursday at the Greenwich Village nightclub Le Poisson Rouge, and says it has already raised $129,000 through online donations -- enough to buy $2.5 million worth of defaulted loans, thanks to their steep markdowns. The people who incurred the debt in the first place will get a certified letter informing them they are off the hook.
The fund-raising effort has its own name, Rolling Jubilee, a reference to the biblical tradition of a jubilee year, in which all debts are forgiven and all indentured servants are given their freedom. Its more recent origin is the Occupy encampment in Zuccotti Park, where a group of protesters started talking seriously about the problem of burdensome student debt. That conversation eventually broadened to a consideration of the role of debt in American society, and Strike Debt was born.
Since then, some of the group's projects have been rebellious, like producing the ''Debt Resistors' Operations Manual,'' an explanation of the credit industry and how to outmaneuver it, including advice on how to fight, or even ignore, creditors. Rolling Jubilee, by contrast, works within the financial markets.
Mr. Gokey said he was initially wary when approaching professional debt buyers to help conduct the transactions.
''I said, look, we're revolutionaries, you might not like what we're trying to do,'' he said. ''And they said, 'Well, I've got kids; they're going to college; they're winding up massively in debt.' So they said they'd be happy to help us get started.''
Since then, the Rolling Jubilee has even won praise from Forbes, the business magazine, which said it was ''Finally, an Occupy Wall Street Idea We Can All Get Behind.''
The event on Thursday will include shows by politically minded humorists like David Rees, author of the ''Get Your War On'' comic, and Lizz Winstead, a co-founder of ''The Daily Show.'' In between there will be short acts by musicians and magicians, as well as ''radical nuns, an all-female mariachi band and a speed lecturer,'' says Laura Hanna, a filmmaker and advocate, who added, ''We see this as our coming-out party.''
Last week near the nightclub, several of the advocates had what they described as a very productive meeting in a bank, or rather, in a bank's A.T.M. lobby. It was the only place they could find to get out of the cold.
The group's first purchase will be medical debt, but it hopes to move on to tuition debt and credit card debt. Members acknowledge that the most wildly successful fund-raiser will not come anywhere near the amount that American consumers owe, estimated at more than $11 trillion.
''This is a long-term thing,'' said Christopher Casuccio, who graduated with about $100,000 in student debt. ''We all know it's going to take years to transform the economic system.''

HEADLINE: Ryan Sees Urban Vote As Reason G.O.P. Lost

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR and JENNIFER STEINHAUER; Sarah Cohen and Dalia Sussman contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- As Representative Paul D. Ryan casts about to find an explanation for the defeat of the Republican presidential ticket, on which he was Mitt Romney's running mate, he is looking to the nation's big cities for answers.
''The surprise was some of the turnout, some of the turnout especially in urban areas, which gave President Obama the big margin to win this race,'' Mr. Ryan said in an interview with WISC-TV back home in Wisconsin on Monday before returning Tuesday to Capitol Hill for the start of the lame-duck session. 
''When we watched Virginia and Ohio coming in,'' Mr. Ryan said, ''and those ones coming in as tight as they were and looking like we were going to lose them, that's when it became clear we weren't going to win.''
Mr. Ryan, now a potential 2016 presidential candidate, has repeated the sentiment in subsequent interviews. And he is not the only conservative who has embraced the notion that a surge of voters in urban America gave Mr. Obama the prize, as many Republicans try to come to grips with how an election they believed was theirs for the taking instead got away.
But his voice carries new weight as he returns to Congress with a larger responsibility to help lead his party back to the White House in the years ahead. Mr. Ryan's blunt assessment of the failures of his ticket are sure to shape the party's political future even as he returns to the immediate business of the fight over spending and taxes.
Mr. Ryan's concerns follow on the heels of other Republicans who argue that the party's lack of appeal to minority voters -- many of whom live in the nation's largest urban centers -- has made it more difficult to win the presidency.
There is some anecdotal evidence to back up the analysis that Mr. Obama was helped by his appeal in the nation's population centers. In Philadelphia and Ohio, for example, local news reports have documented dozens of city precincts where Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan failed to get a single vote. And in Ohio, turnout among blacks, many of whom live in urban areas, increased significantly over 2008.
In the nation's largest cities, exit poll data show that the president won overwhelmingly, earning almost 7 out of every 10 votes. In some states, like Pennsylvania, Mr. Obama did even better in the big cities, winning 85 percent of the vote. Mr. Romney won the nation's suburbs by a narrow margin.
But pointing to urban voters for the Republican failure to win last week does not take into account that the Republican ticket also lost big in some rural, mostly white states, like Iowa and New Hampshire.
And there is little proof from the results of the election that urban turnout over all played the decisive role in swing states like Colorado, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia or Wisconsin, where Mitt Romney lost in Mr. Ryan's suburban home district.
''What Paul Ryan misses is that the Republicans have been losing the urban vote for a long, long time,'' said Marc Morial, the president and chief executive of the National Urban League. ''Now they are losing the suburban vote, too. They are becoming more urban in their character, in their makeup, in the problems.''
In Ohio, for example, Mr. Obama received 63,000 fewer votes in the three big urban counties in 2012 than he did in 2008. In the big urban counties in Virginia, Colorado, Wisconsin or Pennsylvania, Mr. Obama also won by smaller margins than in 2008, typically receiving fewer votes. In Milwaukee, voter turnout did increase, but the Romney/Ryan ticket picked up more than half of the increased number of voters there.
Mr. Morial said he did not know why Mr. Ryan was focusing attention on the nation's urban core as the cause of the Republican losses. But he said the decision by Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan not to attend his group's annual conference was not a good sign that Mr. Ryan wants more outreach in the future.
''Certainly those types of comments do not suggest that those who lost last Tuesday are interested in an open dialogue about the challenges that our communities face,'' Mr. Morial said.
Democrats say that Mr. Ryan's remarks mask the larger issues behind the loss, and represent an inability to grasp other factors behind it.
''In our state, urban voters had two good reasons to come out,'' said Senator Bob Casey, Democrat of Pennsylvania. ''One was to support the president, and the other was the state had tried to implement voter ID laws. But assigning one factor to the case of an electoral defeat is usually pretty dangerous.''
Representative Michael M. Honda, Democrat of California, said that ''urban'' is ''just another code word for people of color.''
''But a lot of people of color live in the countryside, too,'' he added. ''He is just grabbing at straws to justify his loss.''
In an interview broadcast Tuesday with ABC News, Mr. Ryan said he did not think that the nation's voters had given Mr. Obama a mandate to raise taxes on the wealthy.
''I don't think so, because they also re-elected the House Republicans,'' Mr. Ryan said. ''So whether people intended or not, we've got divided government. This is a very close election, and unfortunately divided government didn't work very well the last two years. We're going to have to make sure it works in the next two years.''
Some of Mr. Ryan's aides said that as a candidate he had hoped to spend more time in poor urban areas to explain his theories of fighting poverty, and was restrained by his schedule. He gave an antipoverty speech in Cleveland, one of a handful of such events.
Not all his colleagues agree with Mr. Ryan's analysis, arguing that the party needs to focus on reaching a broader coalition.
''We lost many demographic groups,'' said Representative Trey Gowdy of South Carolina. ''The issue to me is why. I don't think we are one comprehensive immigration bill away from winning Hispanic voters, any more than we are one marginal rate increase from economic nirvana.''

HEADLINE: France Grants Its Recognition To Syria Rebels

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER and RICK GLADSTONE; Steven Erlanger reported from Paris, and Rick Gladstone from New York. Reporting was contributed by Neil MacFarquhar and Hwaida Saad from Beirut, Lebanon; Nick Cumming-Bruce from Geneva; and Richard Berry from Paris.

 BODY:
PARIS -- France announced Tuesday that it was recognizing the newly formed Syrian rebel coalition and would consider arming the group, seeking to inject momentum into a broad Western and Arab effort to build a viable and effective opposition that would hasten the end of a stalemated civil war that has destabilized the Middle East.
The announcement by President Franois Hollande made France the first Western country to fully embrace the new coalition, which came together this past weekend under Western pressure after days of difficult negotiations in Doha, Qatar.
The goal was to make an opposition leadership -- both inside and outside the country -- representative of the array of Syrian groups pressing for the downfall of President Bashar al-Assad. Although Mr. Assad is increasingly isolated as his country descends further into mayhem and despair after 20 months of conflict, he has survived partly because of the disagreements and lack of unity among his opponents. 
Throughout the conflict, the West has taken half measures and been reluctant to back an aggressive effort to oust Mr. Assad. This appears to be the first time that Western nations, with Arab allies, are determined to build a viable opposition leadership that can ultimately function as a government. Whether it can succeed remains unclear.
Mr. Hollande went beyond other Western pledges of support for the new Syrian umbrella rebel group, which calls itself the National Coalition of Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces. But Mr. Hollande's announcement clearly signaled expectations that if the group can establish political legitimacy and an operational structure inside Syria, creating an alternative to the Assad family's four decades in power, it will be rewarded with further recognition, money and possibly weapons.
''I announce that France recognizes the Syrian National Coalition as the sole representative of the Syrian people and thus as the future provisional government of a democratic Syria and to bring an end to Bashar al-Assad's regime,'' said Mr. Hollande, who has been one of the Syrian president's harshest critics.
As for weapons, Mr. Hollande said, France had not supported arming the rebels up to now, but ''with the coalition, as soon as it is a legitimate government of Syria, this question will be looked at by France, but also by all countries that recognize this government.''
Political analysts called Mr. Hollande's announcement an important moment in the Syrian conflict, which began as a peaceful Arab Spring uprising in March 2011. It was harshly suppressed by Mr. Assad, turned into a civil war and has left nearly 40,000 Syrians dead, displaced about 2.5 million and forced more than 400,000 to flee to neighboring countries, according to international relief agencies.
''It's certainly another page of the story,'' Augustus Richard Norton, a professor of international relations at Boston University and an expert on Middle East political history, said of the French announcement. ''I think it's important. But it will be much more important if other countries follow suit. I don't think we're quite there yet.''
Some drew an analogy to France's leading role in the early days of the Libyan uprising when it helped funnel aid, and later military support, to the rebels who had firmly established themselves in eastern Libya and would later topple Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi. But in Syria, rebels have not been as organized and have no hold on significant amounts of territory -- at least not enough to create a provisional government that could resist Mr. Assad's military assaults. The West has also refused, so far, to impose a no-fly zone over Syria, which was critical to the success of the Libyan uprising.
Andrew J. Tabler, a Syria expert at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said that the new coalition would have to create a secure zone in Syria to be successful, and that that step would require support from the United States, which was instrumental in the negotiations that led to the group's creation but has not yet committed to giving it full recognition.
What the French have done, Mr. Tabler said, is significant because they have started the process of broader recognition, putting pressure on the group to succeed. ''They've decided to back this umbrella organization and hope that it has some kind of political legitimacy and keep it from going to extremists,'' he said. ''It's a gamble. The gamble is that it will stiffen the backs of the opposition.''
France's statement also was a clear reflection of frustration with the growing death toll and military stalemate in Syria. It came a week after the re-election of President Obama, who had clearly been unwilling to consider any military policy that could hurt his prospects.
Mr. Hollande's announcement came as the rebel coalition's newly chosen leader, Sheik Ahmed Moaz al-Khatib, a former imam of the historic Umayyad Mosque in Damascus and a respected figure in Syria, made a broad appeal to Western and Arab countries for recognition and military aid. Foreign ministers of the Arab League, while approving the new group as the ''legitimate representative of the Syrian opposition,'' have not agreed on recognizing it as a provisional government to replace Mr. Assad.
France, the former colonial power in Syria, has been pressing for a more committed international effort to help the anti-Assad movement. It has pushed the United Nations Security Council and the United States to act more decisively and has promoted economic and oil sanctions against Syria, both in the United Nations and more successfully in the European Union, which had been a top consumer of Syrian oil.
Under the previous center-right presidency of Nicolas Sarkozy, France played the leading role in organizing an armed intervention in Libya to save the opposition from Colonel Qaddafi's forces. Working with the British, Mr. Sarkozy brought Washington along and helped secure a Security Council mandate that was interpreted as covering military intervention in Libya.
Russia and China have said they felt deceived, however, and both have opposed a similar Council resolution on Syria. In addition, the Obama administration has been firmly against any military intervention in Syria on behalf of a more chaotic opposition with a larger, more visible presence of radical Islamic fighters from other countries.
Still, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton has been important in pressing for a newly constituted, broader Syrian transitional council of the kind established in Qatar on Sunday.
The French have also been helping with civilian projects in areas of Syria held by opposition forces, working with locals to repair food and milk factories and to provide medical supplies and assistance. The idea, French officials have said, is to help the opposition govern and build credibility in so-called liberated areas.
The recognition by France came as new fighting raged in Syria and international relief agencies warned that the humanitarian crisis there had worsened in the past few weeks.
''People are really on the run, hiding,'' said Melissa Fleming, the spokeswoman for the United Nations refugee agency in Geneva. ''They are difficult to count and difficult to access.''
A rebel-held Syrian village at the Turkish border, Ras al-Ain, was bombed by Syrian aircraft for the second consecutive day. And tensions remained high on the armistice line between Syria and Israel in the Golan Heights area controlled by Israel since the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. Israeli tank gunners blasted a Syrian mobile artillery vehicle there on Monday in response to repeated instances of errant mortar shells landing on the Israeli side.
There were also new indications that the Syrian rebels were obtaining more sophisticated weapons without Western help. The Brown Moses blog, considered an authoritative source on arms used in the conflict, reported new images showing insurgents armed with SA-16 and SA-24 shoulder-fired heat-seeking antiaircraft missiles, apparently captured from the Syrian military. Both systems are newer generations of weapons than rebels have been seen carrying before, and pose a new threat to Syrian military aircraft.

HEADLINE: Tampa as Scandal's Social Link

BYLINE: By MICHAEL S. SCHMIDT and SHERYL GAY STOLBERG; Michael S. Schmidt reported from Tampa, Fla., and Sheryl Gay Stolberg from Washington. Michael Wines contributed reporting from New York, and Matthew Rosenberg and Ron Nixon from Washington.

 BODY:
TAMPA, Fla. -- Jill and Scott Kelley moved here about a decade ago, taking up residence in a huge redbrick home with a spectacular view of the water on Bayshore Boulevard, the city's most fashionable street. They quickly established themselves as social hosts to the powerful four-star officers who run two of the nation's most important military commands.
The Kelleys were known for their lavish parties, with extravagant buffets, flowing Champagne, valet parking and cigars for guests from nearby MacDill Air Force Base, including David H. Petraeus and Gen. John R. Allen, who now commands troops in Afghanistan. ''Tampa is the kind of community where, if you're new to the community, you can carve out your own niche,'' said Pam Iorio, the city's former mayor, who recalls mingling with Mr. Petraeus and his wife, Holly, at the Kelleys' home. ''They decided to carve out a niche with the military.'' 
Now the social link between Tampa's military and civilian elite is at the center of an unfolding Washington scandal that has already cost Mr. Petraeus his job as director of the Central Intelligence Agency and has ensnared General Allen, who was Mr. Petraeus's deputy when he was here from 2008 to 2010.
At the heart of the investigation is the Tampa woman who prompted it: Ms. Kelley, 37, who received threatening anonymous e-mails that set off an F.B.I. investigation revealing that Mr. Petraeus had an affair with his biographer, Paula Broadwell. On Tuesday, General Allen was caught up in the scandal, when the Pentagon said that it was investigating whether he had engaged in ''inappropriate communication'' with Ms. Kelley; associates of the general say the messages were innocent, and President Obama voiced support for him.
Records show that Ms. Kelley and her husband, a doctor, have been subject to a string of lawsuits over debts, according to a report in The Tampa Bay Times, which said the Kelleys owed a bank nearly $2.2 million, including attorney fees, on a building they own. They also ran a cancer charity, which appears to be defunct. A 2007 tax filing, the latest available, shows the charity raised $157,284 that year, but spent just $58,417 on program services, described as conducting research to improve the lives of terminally ill adult cancer patients.
Their parties, though, were the talk of the town. In February 2010, a gossip column in The Tampa Bay Times reported that Mr. Petraeus and his wife arrived escorted by 28 police officers on motorcycles to a pirate-themed party at the Kelleys' home, to mark Tampa's Gasparilla Pirate Fest, an annual event. Guests dined on lamb chops and crab cakes, beside hot dog and funnel cake carts, the paper said.
The couple appeared to be well regarded at MacDill, home to Central Command, which runs the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and hosts officers from more than 50 foreign countries, and Special Operations Command, which trains commandos for missions like the one that killed Osama bin Laden. The two sit side by side on the base, where generals, admirals and other high-ranking officers live in elegant homes on a spit of land that juts into Tampa Bay. Often, they invite community leaders to social receptions of their own.
Indeed, Mr. Petraeus and his wife grew so close to the Kelleys that they hosted the couple and Ms. Kelley's twin sister, Natalie Khawam, for Christmas dinner last year. Both General Allen and Mr. Petraeus also wrote letters to a District of Columbia court vouching for Ms. Khawam in a child custody dispute.
That kind of closeness -- and the Kelleys' fancy parties -- strike some military people as odd.
''I have never known there to be groupies around generals,'' said Jacey Eckhart, the military spouse editor of the Web site military.com. ''But just like in every other field of endeavor, there is a certain excitement around people that have great power. And generals, like captains of industry and certain kinds of celebrities, wield a certain kind of power.''
MacDill Air Force Base is a driving force behind the Tampa economy. The local Chamber of Commerce estimates $6.7 billion a year flows into the Tampa Bay area from the base. Military contractors and other defense-related companies dot the city. Business deals are often made in the plentiful strip clubs and steakhouses.
After the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, the base only grew in importance, as Central Command and Special Operations Command took on leading roles in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. It is unusual to have two high-level commands on the same base; that puts MacDill at the center of American military activity. The CentCom commander is typically a local star.
''He was looked at like the C.E.O. of Chrysler is in Detroit,'' said Roger Maddox, a retired military officer who lives here. ''Bigger than the mayor. His existence is what brings so much money to the community.''
The community, meanwhile, welcomes commanders who are outsiders when they arrive.
''Generally when they get down here they have no connection to Tampa but immediately they become part of the fabric of the community,'' said John Lauro, a former federal prosecutor in New York who has lived in Tampa for the past 20 years. ''People reach out to them, want to get close to them.''
Ms. Kelley worked hard to develop that closeness, and functioned as a kind of social liaison between the military commanders and the community. But some here were a bit suspicious of her.
Tampa is, at heart, a conservative Southern city whose most prominent citizens have lived here for decades. Ms. Kelley, a daughter of Lebanese immigrants who grew up in Philadelphia, and her husband, Scott, a cancer surgeon, are still regarded as newcomers.
They were often seen at the Tampa Yacht and Country Club; the late George Steinbrenner, the principal owner of the New York Yankees, was a member. And Ms. Kelley and her sister, Ms. Khawam, raised eyebrows for their 2003 appearance on a Food Network reality show, ''Food Fight.''
While other prominent Tampa residents were supporting the military in other ways -- raising money for wounded veterans, waving flags as a way of showing respect, helping military children with medical needs -- the Kelleys stuck mostly to social events, said Ms. Iorio, the former mayor.
When foreign dignitaries visited Central Command, the command's generals could count on the Kelleys to host a dinner in the dignitaries' honor. Even as news of Ms. Kelley's connection to the emerging Petraeus scandal began spreading Sunday evening, the deputy commander of the Central Command, Vice Adm. Robert S. Harward, was attending a party at her bayside home.

HEADLINE: Invitation to a Dialogue: Advice for the G.O.P.

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Now that Republicans have lost the presidential election and the party's leaders have failed to achieve their stated priority, to make Barack Obama a one-term president, debate has begun over the reasons for their failure and over the party's future. This failure seems partly due to the party's inability to cultivate credible or inspiring leaders and its commitment to tax policies that benefit mainly the rich at the expense of social services that most Americans support. 
The most basic hurdle for the Republicans, though, is arithmetical: 39 percent of the voting population leans Republican, according to the Pew Research Center, while 50 percent leans Democratic. Republicans can try to make up their 11-point gap by appealing to those who identify with neither party. But a party deriving much of its support from rural and blue-collar whites and upper-income people will lose national elections in the future because these groups are shrinking relative to groups that tend to support Democrats.
Given their numerical disadvantages, it takes no leap of logic to understand why Republicans would see suppressing voting by groups that lean Democratic as a key electoral strategy.
But the party's future prospects, and the country's, would be better served by expanding Republicans' appeal to women; to younger voters; to the growing numbers of Americans with college educations; and, particularly, to urban voters, who include most Latinos, African-Americans and Asian-Americans.
To do so, Republicans would have to offer something beyond the ''government is bad'' mantra that alienates many of these potential constituents, an economic program more credible than trickle-down tax cuts, and backward-looking social policies.
A move toward pragmatism will not come easily to a party dominated by ideological hard-liners, but electoral failure may push some Republican leaders to counter the party's dwindling appeal with policies that appeal to more Americans. We should all wish them success.

HEADLINE: What We Learned From the Storm

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, certain lessons have been learned. We now know the following: the Long Island Power Authority's distribution system is antiquated, replacement equipment is often unavailable during a crisis, coordination and supervision are frequently ineffective, and the utility is relying on outdated technology.
We saw memos being written by hand to report power failures in the field, and paper maps being used to find locations. In fact, LIPA's central administration was unable to determine the streets that lost power or had power restored. 
To understand the depth and severity of the problem, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo should press ahead with a comprehensive and immediate investigation on why LIPA was so ill prepared. We need to know what remedial steps need to be taken to confront extreme weather in the future. At the same time, we need to understand the root causes of the gas shortage and how to address a similar crisis in the future.
We have seen an obvious lack of progress since Hurricane Irene hit New York on Aug. 28, 2011. It's time for decisive action.
MICHAEL R. KOBLENZ Mayor East Hills, N.Y., Nov. 12, 2012
To the Editor:
As shocking as it was to read Joe Nocera's Nov. 10 column about the devastation and neglect of the Rockaways since Hurricane Sandy (''No Heat Till Christmas?''), it seemed all too familiar.
The Rockaways have experienced mistreatment and neglect by New York City officials since the end of World War II. When the city began major urban renewal projects after the war, including Lincoln Center, a need arose for places to relocate people displaced from the slums.
Most of them were very poor welfare recipients, and ''far far Rockaway'' became the favored dumping ground in part because of its distance from the rest of the city and its consequent invisibility.
At first, families were placed in converted wooden summer properties that lacked heat and insulation, as well as adequate electricity and plumbing. Eyewitnesses described overcrowding and horrendous living conditions; fires were frequent, and people died. Eventually, the city constructed housing projects, but before long these became infested with drugs, gang warfare and crime.
Today's inadequate response by government officials to disaster in the Rockaways is consistent with the peninsula's sad history. Thanks are due to Mr. Nocera for removing the curtain from the Rockaways' suffering and bringing the plight of its citizens to wider attention.

To the Editor:
Bill Keller's Nov. 12 online column hits on an endeavor that could well be this generation's Manhattan Project or Interstate Highway System. The idea is simply to put as much of our critical infrastructure as possible underground.
This would be a project producing thousands of jobs over a long period of time. It would immensely decrease the human misery inflicted by natural disasters like hurricanes.
It would strengthen our natural security. It would beautify the country by removing poles and lines and cables from every landscape and cityscape. It would not keep trees from falling on houses, but it would keep them from falling on power lines, shutting off electricity to homes and entire cities, and clogging city traffic by falling over into the streets.
It would save lives by removing the danger of live wires in yards and neighborhoods and just by removing the poles that speeders and drunken drivers crash into.
Many developing subdivisions are now being built with the lines underground. Retrofitting the grid of the entire country is a project eagerly awaiting action. As a nice lagniappe, family snapshots could be taken without wires and poles marring the background of every picture.

HEADLINE: The Death of Equities Seems Exaggerated

BYLINE: By RUSSELL PEARLMAN. 
Russell Pearlman is a former writer and editor for SmartMoney magazine. After writing this article, he accepted a job at Oppenheimer & Company, an investment firm, which he will begin in December.

 BODY:
THE clients of Samantha Fraelich's financial planning practice in Chevy Chase, Md., include lawyers, business owners, union tradesmen and even a couple of professional athletes. But regardless of their age, profession or income bracket, nearly all of them are asking her the same thing these days.
'' 'Is 2008 going to happen again? I can't lose another 30 or 40 percent in the market.' That's the first thing out of their mouths,'' she said. Her clients want bulletproof stock portfolios, and she tells them that's just not possible. 
Yet even after hearing that news, Ms. Fraelich's clients are still buying stocks. They want to be somewhat defensive, she says, but they have concluded that stocks beat the alternative of seeing their nest eggs go nowhere.
The conventional wisdom among many who work on or follow Wall Street is that generations of Americans have given up on stocks. As evidence of this reputed hatred, market experts point to the low trading volumes on the nation's stock exchanges and the nearly $440 billion that investors have taken out of stock mutual funds since the beginning of 2008.
Instead, Americans are supposedly saving for retirement or paying for their children's college tuition by buying bonds, bond mutual funds or so-called alternative assets. These can include a mix of investments like commodities, futures funds, hedge funds, farmland and forests.
But a look at the big picture shows that Americans haven't really taken much out of stocks at all. There is more than $5.7 trillion in stock mutual funds alone, according to the Investment Company Institute, an industry trade group that tracks mutual fund dollars. That's more than the total in bond and money market funds combined.
In addition, nearly $880 billion is invested in stock-centric exchange-traded funds. These are bundles of stocks packaged into a single product that can be bought or sold like any stock. No one knows what percentage of that sum is owned by hedge funds or other financial institutions, but individual investors probably own at least a couple of hundred billion dollars' worth, nearly equaling or perhaps exceeding the amount people have taken out of stock mutual funds.
So for all the talk that Wall Street chicanery or the market's gyrations have killed investors' appetite for equities, Americans' commitment to stocks has been remarkably strong.
What is still driving investors is the belief that most of them will have to rely on the stock market if they want to retire comfortably. Guaranteed pensions are, for most people under 40, a pipe dream.
Relying on the market can be scary. After all, these days you can follow your portfolio's fluctuations in real time on your smartphone. Even though the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has risen about 25 percent since early 2010, about 40 percent of individual investors are bearish, believing prices will fall in the next six months, according to the American Association of Individual Investors.
Fortunately, many financial advisers say, it's not that difficult for someone far from retirement to set up a portfolio that, while not bulletproof, at least has a good chance of growing significantly over time.
Stocks aren't particularly expensive on a valuation basis. Wall Street tends to value a company's stock on a multiple of its future expected profits. These days, stocks, as a group, are valued at about 15 times expected 2012 profits, a figure in line with long-term averages. International stocks, beaten down by worries about the European and Chinese economies, are even cheaper.
Stocks are also paying out a decent amount of money. More than 400 of the S.& P. 500 companies are paying a dividend in one form or another, a number not seen since 1999. Predictably profitable companies like Johnson & Johnson, Cisco and Intel are all paying 3 percent or more.
Diversification across stock sizes, sectors and countries is essential, advisers say. The likelihood of all stocks of all shapes and sizes falling in unison as they did in 2008 is pretty low.
It took Chris Murphy, 40, a Manhattan Beach, Calif., camera operator, a little time to be persuaded of the merits of diversifying, especially because it meant he would have to sell some of his Apple stock. But, on the recommendation of his adviser, he did sell some Apple and bought Verizon, a less volatile stock that pays a higher dividend. ''I've decreased our risk in case Apple tanks,'' Mr. Murphy said.
Relying on stocks, many advisers say, is not only beneficial but necessary because of how low interest rates are. A one-year bank certificate of deposit is paying, on average, 0.8 percent a year. Money market accounts pay even less. Ten-year Treasury bonds are paying just over 1.6 percent, less than the annual rate of inflation. If inflation goes up, it will eat away at the buying power of the interest the bonds pay.
''If your time frame is 10 years or more,'' said Adam B. Scott, founder of Argyle Capital Partners, a financial adviser in Los Angeles, ''you're better off in stocks.''

HEADLINE: Despite Efforts of Oil Producers, Fracking Faces Strong Opposition in Europe

BYLINE: By STANLEY REED

 BODY:
ST. ANNES, ENGLAND -- Just outside Blackpool, a town of faded cabarets and amusement rides on the Irish Sea, a drilling rig sits in a muddy farm field. The big white and yellow machine represents the latest attempt by Cuadrilla Resources to see if it can bring Northwest England the sort of shale gas revolution that has transformed the U.S. energy picture.
Cuadrilla's chief executive, Francis Egan, who joined the company four months ago after a career spent in the international oil industry at giants like Marathon and BHP Billiton, says that Cuadrilla believes there is 200 trillion cubic feet of gas beneath the company's 900-square-kilometer, or 348-square-mile, concession in the area.
''That is a huge amount of gas,'' he says. Even if only 10 percent were extractable, it would be enough to fuel Britain's current consumption for about seven years. 
Britain is one of several European countries where experts think there could be commercially exploitable shale gas. The U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates that there may be as much as 600 trillion cubic feet of recoverable shale gas in Europe, or about 40 years' consumption.
But there is still uncertainty about whether significant volumes of gas can be produced in Europe through drilling and hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, as has been done in the United States. The industry is barely getting started in Europe, but opposition is already strong.
Countries including France have banned fracking, the process of breaking up dense shale to free the natural gas.
Environmentalists, as well as many people living near possible shale gas sites, worry about the huge quantities of water that fracking uses. They also fear that shale gas will prolong the fossil fuel era by reducing the incentive to switch to cleaner but more expensive energy sources like solar and wind.
Cuadrilla's efforts in Britain are being closely watched as a test case. The company is backed by a leading U.S. energy private equity firm, Riverstone Holdings, which owns a 41 percent stake. John Browne, a former chief executive of BP and now Riverstone's chief in Europe as well as Cuadrilla's chairman, still enjoys great prestige in Britain.
''If companies like Cuadrilla can make one example work, we believe that bans in other countries may be lifted'' said Menno Koch, an analyst at Lambert Energy Advisory in London.
The results of the limited shale gas explorations in Europe so far have been mixed. Earlier this year, for example, Exxon Mobil pulled out of Poland, once considered among the most promising shale spots, after drilling just two wells. The company said the data it collected suggested that the deposits were not commercially viable.
Nearly all the companies involved in shale gas exploration across Europe say there is not yet enough information to draw firm conclusions about how much gas is there and, more important, whether it can be made to flow.
Derek Magness, Warsaw-based director of European onshore operations for Chevron, said that he and colleagues had made it a practice to hunt around in old government repositories in Eastern Europe for dusty boxes of paper drilling logs and rock core samples.
''The data we are getting gives us additional curiosity,'' he said. ''We want to be very thorough.''
Chevron has drilled two wells in Poland and is preparing to start a third. Mr. Magness said the company had identified potentially rich shale areas in a broad region extending from the Baltic to the Mediterranean. It has locked up millions of acres along this band in Poland and Romania and won a tender for more in Ukraine. Mr. Magness filled in another piece of the puzzle recently by acquiring a 50 percent stake in a privately held Lithuanian oil and gas exploration company, LL Investicijos.
Figuring out what is underground may be difficult, but most companies are finding what they call aboveground risks even more daunting.
Cuadrilla hurt its cause last year when one of its fracking operations set off small earth tremors. Mr. Egan said pumping fracking fluids into the earth lubricated natural fractures so they slid, causing the quakes.
The incident stoked opposition. Last year, three activists from a group called Frack-off entered a Cuadrilla drilling site and chained themselves to the equipment. In July, a court found them guilty of trespassing and fined them 750, or about $1,200, each.
Nathan Roberts, a Frack-off campaigner, said that his group was opposed to shale gas and other so-called unconventionals in part because these techniques required many wells to be drilled.
''If companies go ahead and look to exploit all the unconventional gases they could exploit, you are looking at tens of thousands of wells over this tiny island, which is densely populated,'' he said.
Cuadrilla is trying to defuse the opposition. The drill rig at St. Annes sits on an impermeable membrane and has water-quality and seismic monitors, and is even surrounded by piles of rolled hay bales, lest the sight of the rig disturb the birds that feed in the fields.
Climbing over the steel decks of the rig during a brief hail shower, Mr. Egan pointed to an acoustic monitor in a wire cage just beyond the fenced-in perimeter.
''There is a need to collect data,'' he said. ''There are a lot of myths.''
To find out whether the gas will flow in sufficient quantities to be commercial Mr. Egan wants to drill two horizontal wells and then fracture the rock in them to measure the output.
Cuadrilla has started to drill an 11,000-foot vertical well at the new site, but it still needs permission to go horizontal, and the decision to allow fracking may need to come from the highest levels of the British government.
Companies that want to exploit shale gas in Europe are also learning that they must tread softly or they will go nowhere.
''The days of Texas wildcatting are over. You can't just pick a spot and drill; you have to go through lots of engagement, '' said Mr. Magness of Chevron, which has had protesters block access to sites in Poland.
Exxon Mobil, which halted drilling on what it considers promising acreage in Lower Saxony in Germany in the face of local opposition in 2010, is still working to overcome fears that drilling would ruin neighborhoods. To reduce noise, the company hangs sound curtains on some of its rigs and is considering using electric motors, which are quieter than diesel-powered ones.
''You've got to convince people it doesn't have a negative impact,'' said Tristan J. Aspray, Exxon Mobil's exploration operations manager for Europe and Greenland.
In straight economic terms, producing shale gas in Europe would appear to make a lot of sense. Europe is a big gas market and, unlike in the United States, its own gas production is declining, making it more dependent on imports from countries like Algeria, Libya and, especially, Russia.
Easing this dependence is a big part of Chevron's pitch to Eastern European countries, which are entirely dependent on Russia for their gas.
''Of course this is a big chance for Europe, where we focus on energy security and understand that this might make us more independent,'' said Boguslaw Sonik, a European Parliament member from Poland.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: On the New Shopping List: Milk, Bread, Eggs and a Mortgage

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE CLIFFORD and JESSICA SILVER-GREENBERG

 BODY:
Lilly Neubauer shops Costco for paper towels, lentils and carrots -- and now, even a home mortgage.
While Ms. Neubauer, 27, said she was surprised to find the warehouse club selling financial products, she and her husband saved about $200 a month by refinancing through its Web site this year. She also bought home insurance from Costco, she said, again because it was cheaper there.
''It opened us up to the fact that Costco is more than toilet paper,'' said Ms. Neubauer, who lives in Dallas.
As the nation's largest banks stay stingy with credit and a growing portion of the population has no bank at all, major retailers are stepping into the void. Customers can now withdraw cash at an A.T.M. with a prepaid card from Walmart, take out a loan at Home Depot for a kitchen renovation or kick-start a new venture with a small-business loan from Sam's Club. This year, Walmart even started to test selling a life insurance policy. 
Consumer advocates are torn about the growth of this shadow banking industry. Financial products are making it into the hands of people who otherwise might not qualify for them, but these products are not always subject to the same regulations as bank products are. And to turn a profit, retailers generally have to charge more to people with poor credit or none at all.
''These products can come with high fees and few real protections,'' said Norma P. Garcia, a senior lawyer with Consumers Union.
For the retailers, banking products are not huge profit centers but a business strategy, meant to put money into customers' hands and get them buying more.
''You've got to remember, Walmart is intended to be a one-stop shop,'' said Charles M. Holley Jr., the company's chief financial officer.
Retailers were once interested in actually becoming banks. Sears, in the 1980s, tried a ''socks and stocks'' strategy that included acquiring the Dean Witter brokerage firm. And Wal-Mart Stores sought a banking charter for almost a decade before finally abandoning the quest in 2007.
While supermarket chains have leased space to bank branches for years, they are now offering their own products or teaming with small financial firms to do an end run around big banks. While the banks are likely to bristle at such competition, supporters of the retailers say the stores are stepping into areas that banks have abandoned.
''The banks kind of dropped the ball, and in my mind, and in the consumers' mind, they left it open for different approaches,'' said Robert L. Phillips, a professor at Columbia Business School.
Part of the lure is the so-called underbanked population -- people who use few, if any, bank services. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation estimates that roughly 10 million households in the United States do not use a bank, up from nine million three years ago. And the agency says 24 million more households have a bank account but still use nonbank financial services, like prepaid cards.
Mr. Holley said that 20 to 25 percent of Walmart customers were unbanked.
''The more kinds of services we can offer our core customer like that, the better for them,'' he said.
Last month, Walmart unveiled a prepaid card with American Express. The card operates much like a debit card except that it is not attached to a bank account. It comes with free customer-service telephone support, and fees are relatively low, but the account is not backed by the F.D.I.C.
Frustrated with the fees charged by her bank, Nancy Fry, a real estate broker in Logan, Utah, bought a prepaid card from Walmart this year. But this was even worse, she said -- she was charged $3 every time she loaded money onto the card. ''I really don't have very much money and can't afford these fees,'' she said.
Consumer advocates complain that prepaid cards are loosely regulated and can cannibalize the money put on them. Consumer lawyers have pushed for greater disclosure of fees and more stringent regulation of the card providers. The government is expected to issue new rules this year.
Walmart began to test selling a one-year MetLife life insurance policy this year, and customers can wire money or pay bills at any Walmart store.
Costco is also courting customers who are fed up with their banks. ''A lot of members think their bank fees are too high, or the trust level has gone down over the years, or they're having issues with debit and credit cards,'' said Jay Smith, Costco's director of business and financial services.
Costco sells auto and homeowners' insurance, offers credit card processing for small businesses and began making mortgages in late 2010. It does not make money on the mortgages, which are offered by small lenders, Mr. Smith said. The idea is to get people to renew their store memberships, where Costco makes a large chunk of its profit.
Home Depot, whose customers are mainly homeowners, is trying to increase sales by extending credit to people who would otherwise have trouble getting it. Last year, the company began offering loans of up to $40,000, and this year it extended its no-interest credit card payment terms. ''We have the ability to get credit to consumers in this tight credit market, and we wanted people to take advantage of that in a market where people don't have access to home-equity lines of credit like they used to,'' said Dwaine Kimmet, Home Depot's treasurer and vice president for financial services.
Mr. Kimmet said the loans were especially useful for people who needed emergency items, like a water heater, though shoppers use them for other home dcor projects as well.
They are also helpful for Home Depot, whose sales growth has been squeezed by the housing crisis.
Mr. Kimmet said the store loans, unlike home-equity lines of credit, did not require collateral, meaning Home Depot could not seize someone's house for a failure to pay.
The interest rate on Home Depot's credit card is higher than that on a typical credit card -- 18 percent to 27 percent, depending on credit score, compared with an average of 14.59 percent, according to Bankrate. But Mr. Kimmet said the retailer offered cards to people with credit scores as low as 600, below what many lenders accept.
Other retailers are also trying to make it easier for people to qualify for financial products. Office Depot and Sam's Club offer loans backed by the government's Small Business Administration, and both involve quick, one-page initial applications. More than 1,000 Sam's Club members have used the program since its introduction two years ago, the company said.
When Kent Prater was about to open a restaurant in Lumberton, N.C., he searched online for loans backed by the Small Business Administration and found that Sam's Club sold them. He applied online for a $25,000 loan and was approved for a $10,000 loan, with an interest rate of about 10 percent. With a bank, ''I think it would probably be a little bit more difficult, because of the environment -- the economy and the regulatory environment,'' said Mr. Prater, who opened Thai Chili last month.
Paco Underhill, who researches shopper behavior as founder and chief executive of Envirosell, said retailers offering financial products was only the beginning.
''The banks are going to scream bloody murder when retailers try to obtain banking charters,'' he said. ''But it's not hard for a retail organization to look across the landscape and say, 'Who are my customers, and what else could I be selling them?' ''

HEADLINE: Christie Reverses Stand on Tax Increases in Face of Rebuilding Storm-Ravaged New Jersey

BYLINE: By KATE ZERNIKE

 BODY:
Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican who has pushed aggressively for cutting and capping taxes in New Jersey during his three years in office, said Tuesday that people who lived in towns destroyed by Hurricane Sandy were likely to pay higher taxes to help rebuild. 
''It's got to be paid for,'' he said. ''There's no magic money tree.''
In a 40-minute news conference in Trenton, Mr. Christie said he expected the federal government to do as much as it had done for victims of Hurricane Katrina on the Gulf Coast to help rebuild New Jersey. And he said that municipalities would be allowed to raise property taxes more than the 2 percent limit that he signed into law in 2010 to cover costs brought on by the storm.
''No one's ever happy with higher taxes, but the fact is, what annoys people more than anything else is waste,'' he said. ''As long as they know that the money's being spent in a way that's helping to bring their town back to life, I think people will understand it's got to be done.''
It was a striking endorsement of the role of higher taxes and the federal government in helping the recovery, particularly coming from a governor who has often been held up as a leader in the movement to rein in both.
But Mr. Christie, wearing a suit and tie rather than the fleece jacket seen in his TV appearances the last two weeks, disagreed that the storm had brought on a change of heart. Unlike Mitt Romney, he said, he had never questioned the need for the Federal Emergency Management Agency. ''Emergency response is always something that I've thought was an appropriate governmental function,'' he said.
''There are plenty of instances that can happen in our country where a state by itself is not equipped to deal with the results of a natural disaster,'' he continued. ''And so the country needs to band together to help its other states to be able to get over something that has been disproportionately foisted on one or two or three states of the 50. But no, it hasn't turned me from a limited-government guy to a big-government guy.''
Mr. Christie showed little sign of backing off the 10 percent tax cut he has been pushing all year. To pay for that cut, Mr. Christie presumed that revenues would grow by more than 7 percent. With the state's unemployment rate hovering well above the national average, tax revenues have lagged far behind those predictions. The devastation of Hurricane Sandy -- with scores of homes and businesses destroyed -- has made that growth even more unlikely.
The governor said the state treasury would release figures at the end of this week projecting the storm's damage to the state economy. He has argued that as people buy things to rebuild, sales and income tax revenues may actually increase.
But he also said that he has always known ''that if something catastrophic happens, you have to adjust your position.''
''I know how to do math,'' he said. ''I'm a realist.''

HEADLINE: Congress Resumes With a G.O.P. Leadership Fight

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEISMAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The battle to shape the Republican Party's direction after its electoral losses will see its first skirmish in the Capitol on Wednesday in a House leadership fight in which the profile might be low but the symbolism is high.
The House's Republican leaders would dearly like to elevate Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington to lead the House Republican Conference, putting a female face into the pantheon of the white male Republican leaders. But standing in their way is Representative Tom Price of Georgia, one of the most conservative members of the House, who has lined up some big guns in his quest for the fourth-ranking post in the House Republican conference. 
The most important of those guns, Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, the defeated Republican vice-presidential nominee, showed no sign of retreat Tuesday in a letter sent to colleagues endorsing Mr. Price.
''In the House of Representatives, we have an obligation and a real opportunity to produce and promote a positive and principled agenda for the American people,'' Mr. Ryan wrote. ''Over the past two years, we have offered bold solutions to our fiscal and economic challenges. We must not let up.''
The McMorris Rodgers-Price clash could set the tone for the coming Congress. Lawmakers arrived Tuesday for the lame-duck session amid an atmosphere unsettled by Democratic victories. Democrats were giddy as children on the first day of school. Republicans vacillated between notes of contrition and defiance. And the shape of the 113th Congress is only starting to come into focus.
Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader, said she would announce on Wednesday morning whether she would seek another term in that post or step aside. And Senator-elect Angus King of Maine, an independent, said he was likely to say Wednesday which party he would caucus with.
Newly elected lawmakers alternated between being brash and press-shy. Patrick Murphy, the 29-year-old Floridian who apparently defeated Allen West, the Tea Party hero, was the only incoming House Democrat handed the microphone at an event introducing the large new Democratic class, and he hailed his still-disputed victory as a call for bipartisan cooperation. Meantime, Mr. West has refused to concede.
Senator-elect Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, perhaps the biggest star of the incoming class of Democrats, blew past a throng of reporters on her way to a lunch for new senators, using Senator-elect Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin as a shield.
''Pretend you're talking to me,'' Ms. Warren told her new colleague.
But for a party still grappling with the meaning of its losses, the vote by incoming House Republicans on who will lead their conference is gaining outsize importance. Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio, trying to clear the path for Ms. McMorris Rodgers and head off a divisive fight, offered Mr. Price the post of chairman of the House Republican leadership. It is not a marquee position, but it has been held by figures like Rob Portman, now an Ohio senator. But Mr. Price declined.
Instead, he set out to line up the House's most ardent conservatives behind him. In a letter also released Tuesday, the outgoing Republican conference chairman, Representative Jeb Hensarling of Texas, and the governor-elect of Indiana, Representative Mike Pence, also threw their support behind Mr. Price.
''These times demand strong, principled leadership in order to put our nation back on the path toward greater success and opportunity,'' they wrote in their letter. ''Republicans have made a commitment to the American people to put forth solutions that speak to these challenges -- solving them, not simply managing them.''
Ms. McMorris Rodgers has her own slate of heavy hitters, largely from the party's establishment. Allies say she has the support of 15 committee chairmen, including Representatives Fred Upton of Michigan of the Energy and Commerce Committee; Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida of the Foreign Affairs Committee; Peter King of New York of the Homeland Security Committee; and Darrell Issa of California of Oversight and Government Reform.
Representatives Pat Tiberi of Ohio and Tom Cole of Oklahoma -- both close allies of the speaker -- are heading Ms. McMorris Rodgers's vote-counting operation. And she has the support of Representative Tim Scott of South Carolina, now the House Republicans' most prominent African-American.
In her pitch to colleagues, Ms. McMorris Rodgers has spoken of her ''bold vision'' for conservative reform, but she has also emphasized more basic details, down to the money she has raised for Republican election efforts, her work on behalf of Mitt Romney's presidential campaign and her authorship of legislation to rescind a $100 billion line of credit for the International Monetary Fund that has been ''used to bail out Greece and the European Union.''

HEADLINE: Women Make History, for Now

BYLINE: By LUISITA LOPEZ TORREGROSA

 BODY:
NEW YORK -- Now that the crucial role that female voters played in the re-election of President Barack Obama and their record-breaking victories on Election Day are the stuff of history, feminist groups, activists, political strategists and future candidates are taking stock and plotting the next act.
But first, briefly, drink in what happened. 
The next Congress, convening in January, will have 20 female senators -- up from 17 -- the most in U.S. history. It will have a record number of women -- at least 81, with a couple of races involving women yet to be decided -- in the House of Representatives. All six Democratic women up for re-election in the Senate won their races, and five first-timers were elected: four Democrats and one Republican. Notable newcomers include the firebrand populist Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Representative Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, who will become the nation's first openly gay senator.
What's more, for the first time, the South Carolina Senate, the only all-male legislative chamber, will include a woman. And New Hampshire is sending an all-female delegation to Congress, two senators and two representatives, and elected a female governor as well.
These breakthroughs might help the United States raise its global rank in future Gender Gap reports by the World Economic Forum. The 2012 index, which measures women's economic participation, educational attainment, health and political empowerment, was released in October and ranked the United States 22nd over all -- a drop from 17th in 2011.
On Election Day, American women really did make their mark. Their ascendance can be laid at least in part at the door of right-wing Republicans who mounted what feminists -- but not just them -- saw as a ''war on women,'' with their opposition to unfettered abortion rights, required insurance coverage for contraceptives and aid to women's health organizations like Planned Parenthood. At the same time, many in the Republican Party and its media-entertainment complex of strident far-right radio and television personalities denigrated Latinos and underestimated the youth vote. Women and Latinos counterattacked, voting in droves for Mr. Obama, propelling him, with strong support from young people, to a resounding victory in the Electoral College. Comprehensive immigration reform, the lost cause of Mr. Obama's first term, is back on the front burner with a good chance of passage, and Latinos have become a key part of a new governing coalition.
But no one is resting on their laurels, least of all feminists. With post-election celebrations piping down, what's next?
''We can be encouraged, but Tuesday didn't really change the reality of where we are,'' said Siobhan Bennett, the chief executive of the Women's Campaign Fund, a Washington-based nonpartisan organization that promotes abortion rights. ''We must have equal representation on both sides of the aisles,'' she said by telephone two days after the vote. ''We have been sleepwalking since 1992. We thought this problem would somehow magically solve itself after that 'year of the woman.' Nothing could be further from the truth.''
With gender quotas having no chance of enactment in a quota-phobic United States, Ms. Bennett wants the major political parties at least to guarantee that women will make up no less than 30 percent of their political tickets.
''We must have a common purpose, a rising national consciousness that having women elected to office is essential,'' she said, ''but that national will is completely and totally lacking here.''
Ms. Bennett plans to host a diverse panel of business executives, activists and advocates in December to help fire up support for female candidates. ''We need a visionary male leader helping us,'' she said. ''If we make it just for women, like women's organizations, it's not going to happen. We need men assisting us to get over the 30 percent hump. We don't have enough critical mass. We won't get the critical mass until we get more women. But to get to that phase, we need men and women.''
Few female leaders would disagree with the need for support -- from men and women -- but tactics, strategies and missions might differ.
''We've got 20 -- 20 is good, but 20 is not enough,'' Stephanie Schriock, the president of Emily's List, a 27-year-old nonprofit fund-raising organization dedicated to the election of Democratic women who support abortion rights, said by telephone from Washington. ''What you see now is a perfect example of what you'll see in the future.''
In an informal index of women's heightened involvement, the group raised $51.2 million this year and quintupled its membership to two million.
It has been training and recruiting women, starting at the legislative level, for nearly three decades and has spotted and guided candidates like Ms. Baldwin, the senator-elect, since her early days in Wisconsin politics in the 1990s.
''We'll be ready for the next round of senatorial candidates and gubernatorial candidates and someday, yes, the first Democratic woman presidential nominee,'' Ms. Schriock said. ''We have lots of rising stars, some of them senators, and particularly our secretary of state, Hillary Clinton. I believe she's at the very top of the list.''
No doubt, the 2016 campaign is under way -- and women are in the thick of it.

HEADLINE: Shares Decline on Fiscal Concerns In the U.S. and Europe

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Stocks on Wall Street closed lower on Tuesday, as fears about fiscal battles in Washington and the troubles in Greece tipped major indexes from gains to losses throughout the day. A surge in shares of Home Depot prevented a steeper drop for the Dow Jones industrial average.
The Dow closed down closed down 58.90 points, or 0.5 percent, at 12,756.18. It would have been lower without support from Home Depot, whose stock jumped 3.6 percent after the company beat expectations for its fiscal third-quarter earnings. Home Depot is benefiting from the gradual housing recovery and rebuilding efforts after Hurricane Sandy. Its stock rose $2.22 to $63.38. 
Stocks had opened lower after European leaders postponed the latest aid package for Greece. The Dow turned positive in the first hour of trading and rose solidly through the morning, gaining as much as 83 points. Starting around 2 p.m., the average slid steadily into the red.
Other indexes also closed lower. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 5.50 points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,374.53. The Nasdaq composite index fell 20.37 points, or 0.7 percent, to 2,883.89.
Investors are trading against the backdrop of federal spending cuts and tax increases that will take effect automatically at the beginning of next year unless United States leaders reach a compromise before then.
Worries about this possibility pushed United States stocks to one of their worst weekly losses of the year last week after voters re-elected President Obama and a deeply divided Congress. Mr. Obama met on Tuesday with labor leaders and others who advocate higher taxes on the wealthy and want to protect health benefits for seniors and other government programs. The president will meet with business leaders Wednesday.
''The longer we sit and do nothing'' about the nation's fiscal issues, ''the more this market is going to oscillate between positive 40 and negative 60, until we know what's going to happen next with all this uncertainty,'' said Craig Johnson, senior technical research strategist with Piper Jaffray & Company in Minneapolis.
Mr. Johnson says he expects the S.& P. 500 to climb to 1,550 in the next six months as investors get over their lingering unease from the recent recession and companies understand better how government policy on taxes, health care and spending will affect them.
European stocks had been lower but rose after trading opened in New York. Benchmark indexes in France, Britain and Germany closed modestly higher.
Traders in Europe are concerned because finance ministers, in a surprise, postponed $40 billion in aid desperately needed for Greece. A day earlier, there was word that leaders had prepared a positive report on Greece, making it appear likely that the aid would be released.
''It's a little bit like 'Groundhog Day,' '' said Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at the ConvergEx Group, referring to the movie whose protagonist, played by Bill Murray, must relive the same day over and over. Until there is decisive news from Washington or Brussels, neither of which appears imminent, markets will remain vulnerable to short-term swings caused by headlines, Mr. Colas said.
The next major catalysts for a market move, he said, will be gauges of spending by consumers on the traditional shopping rush on the day after Thanksgiving.
The Treasury's benchmark 10-year notes rose 7/32, to 100 9/32, while the yield slid to 1.59 percent, from 1.61 percent late Friday, as demand increased for ultrasafe investments. The United States bond market was closed on Monday in observance of the Veterans Day holiday.

HEADLINE: New Leadership in China

 BODY:
The unveiling of China's new leadership this week and the government transition that follows will be enormously important for the United States and the world. When Xi Jinping replaces Hu Jintao as the Communist Party's general secretary on Thursday at the end of the 18th Party Congress, he will take control of a country that has made tremendous strides in the last decade but also faces daunting domestic and international challenges. 
China, the world's second-largest economy, has lifted millions of people out of poverty. But growth has slowed, state-run enterprises remain dominant in most industries and the gap between rich and poor is among the widest anywhere. Social and political unrest is increasing.
Record numbers of professionals, insecure about their future and seeking more freedoms, have moved to places like Australia; even poorer Chinese are leaving to work abroad as taxi drivers, fishermen and farmers. Corruption has significantly eroded trust in all levels of government.
Addressing the Congress on Thursday, Mr. Hu acknowledged that corruption threatened the party and the state. But he gave no idea how the party leaders would take on this pervasive problem, and he made no commitment to pursuing other necessary reforms. To build a modern economy, China has to break up state-owned monopolies, encourage more consumer spending, create a trustworthy banking sector and reduce reliance on investment in real estate and heavy industry.
Nor did Mr. Hu give any indication of change in the party's suffocating control of the political system, the courts, the news media, the military and civic life. He ruled out fundamental liberalization, insisting ''we must uphold the leadership of the party.'' That position is ultimately untenable in a country with growing political discontent and in a world where self-determination is becoming the norm.
Mr. Hu is handing over to Mr. Xi a government confident of its military and political clout abroad. But he is also leaving a dangerous problem by failing to manage the disputes over islands and shoals in the South China Sea and East China Sea, especially with Japan.
The new leadership also has to decide the nature of its relationship with the United States. China's military expansion and the Obama administration's decision to engage more with Asia has created new friction and mistrust. How Mr. Xi, who will be named president in March by the National People's Congress, manages this question will affect China's growing economy and the ability of both nations to address regional and international issues.
China's leadership is a collective run by consensus. It could be sometime before the new relationships shake out and the world gets a clear sense of how Mr. Xi and his new colleagues intend to make their mark. Will they pursue the recalcitrant policies favored by Mr. Hu or more reformist choices that are essential to allowing China to grow and become more of a force for stability in the world?

HEADLINE: The Role, And Limits, Of Charity

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER. 
E-mail: eporter@nytimes.com; Twitter: @portereduardo

 BODY:
Anyone doubting Americans' charity should visit the Rockaways in Queens. Volunteers from all over the city and beyond have descended upon the devastated communities, providing cash, supplies and assistance to locals marooned in waterlogged homes without food or power. They are helping to fill a void in the government's sometimes plodding response to the disaster wrought by Hurricane Sandy.
''The government is doing its own thing,'' said Brett Scudder, a community advocate from Far Rockaway who has been walking up and down the boardwalk, helping coordinate the relief effort. ''They must get things approved. We don't have time for that now.''
Roy Niederhoffer, a hedge fund manager who lives on the Upper West Side and who has been delivering aid across the area, suggests that private citizens have a big role to play. ''We can't rely on the government for all of this.'' 
Ten days after the big storm hit New York, donations to aid the relief effort exceeded $116 million.
The outpouring of support highlights how central a role charity plays in our social contract -- we Americans view ourselves as generous, yet we mistrust the government to help those in need. Our trust in charity is uniquely American. We pay less tax as a share of our income than citizens of virtually every other rich economy in the world. But we contribute more to charity than citizens of any other country.
When Democrats attacked the Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney for paying only 13 percent of his income in taxes last year, his allies pointed out that the Romneys had given nearly 30 percent of their income to charity.
Support for charity has a partisan bias. Republicans much prefer charity to taxes. Democrats are more tolerant of bigger government. Still, 95 percent of all Americans say they donate to a church or other charitable institution.
Earlier this year, Bank of America and the Institute on Philanthropy of Indiana University published their annual survey about charitable giving among high-net-worth households and found that faith in the government to help society was rather limited. Of the respondents, 91 percent said they trusted nonprofits' ability to solve societal problems. Only 56 percent trusted the federal government to do so.
Our confidence in the power of philanthropy may soon be tested. If a set of spending cuts and tax increases kick in on Jan. 1 in the absence of a budget deal between Democrats and Republicans, the size of government will shrink considerably.
Those actions would cut nearly $900 million from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The budget to teach English to immigrants would lose more than $700 million. Special education and rehabilitation would lose $1.3 billion. There would be $140 million less for financial aid for poor students.
Even if Democrats and Republicans agree on a more gradual way to reduce the deficit over time, it seems that many important programs will be reduced.
Philanthropy, then, seems more important than ever. Looming cuts to federal programs and shrinking state budgets mean that charity will have a bigger void to fill. But one of the things that induces people to give to these causes is a break on their taxes. It is legitimate to ask whether a government pressed for money should be forgoing $40 billion a year in tax breaks mostly pocketed by the rich for their charitable donations.
Should the government raise more money by cutting the charitable tax deduction for the wealthiest Americans, as President Obama has proposed, even if philanthropy itself took a hit from reduced contributions? Or should we stand by the Republican Party platform, which says that because of charities' vital role ''fostering benevolence and patriotism,'' their tax preferences should not be touched?
Whatever its merits, charity is small relative to the potential need. Total charitable contributions in the United States were under $300 billion last year -- less than 2 percent of the nation's economic output. Doubling that amount wouldn't fill the hole left by deficit reduction -- which experts estimate at about $500 billion a year in the long term.
For all the trust we put in big philanthropists like Bill Gates and Eli Broad deploying vast resources for the public good, private charitable contributions have been stuck around 2 percent of personal income for years, according to the Center on Philanthropy. Corporate donations have never increased much above 1 percent of pretax profits.
Indeed, the vast growth of the nonprofit sector since the 1980s has been fueled not by donations but by fees and payments from the government. In 2008, philanthropic contributions provided only 12 percent of nonprofits' revenue. Fees and grants from government accounted for about a third.
There is another, perhaps more fundamental argument against turning to charity to provide the kind of social assistance that a shrinking government cannot. Most philanthropists, generous as they may be, don't usually see replacing government services as their job.
The nation's philanthropists tend to prefer charity to taxes because they get to decide which cause is worthy. The flip side is that philanthropy is pretty much unaccountable to society. Unfettered by democratic controls and dictated by the preferences of donors, it doesn't have a great track record of devoting itself to our most pressing social needs.
Religious organizations receive about one-third of the nation's total charitable contributions, not including donations to religious hospitals, schools and social charities. Donations to human services charities, by contrast, which work to ease poverty, feed the hungry and the like, amount to less than 12 percent of the total.
Charity can achieve some social goals. George Soros, who has donated some $8 billion over the course of his career, credits the work of his Open Society Institute for a vast jump in the retention of children in Baltimore public schools. ''One harmful consequence of the 'No child left behind' program is that principals are trying to meet the requirements by putting troublemakers directly into jail,'' he said. ''The state is doing something which is harmful. We are trying to correct it.''
Mr. Soros notes that philanthropy can innovate more than government and can offer alternative approaches to challenges -- setting examples and developing standards to determine the success of initiatives. Still, he concedes, ''there are a lot of excessive claims about what philanthropy can and should do.''
In fact, a small portion of philanthropic efforts are aimed at helping those who most need it. A study by Rob Reich, an associate professor of political science at Stanford University, concluded that only a small share of charity redistributes income from the wealthy to the poor. A big chunk of the $40 billion donated last year to educational nonprofits went for new buildings and new programs at someone's alma mater. Donations to schools in affluent school zones tend to help their own children, not those on the other side of the tracks.
As the government grapples with how to address the nation's deficits over coming decades, Americans have an opportunity to reassess the role of philanthropy in addressing the nation's problems. Should we continue to provide lavish tax breaks? Should we demand that in return for preferential tax treatment, programs target more clearly the needs of the poor?
Many Americans might think that keeping tax breaks for donations to build, say, a new university football stadium when so many poor students can barely afford college, is not the best way to spend scarce resources.

HIGHLIGHT: A cruise rookie gets her sea legs. 

 BODY:
 A cruise rookie gets her sea legs. 
The ship had launched in Lisbon and passed Morocco before we boarded in the sleepy seaside city of Valencia, Spain, where the boardwalk is studded with palm trees, beds of red roses and tattooed skateboarders streaming by. It's the birthplace of paella, and food was about to be trending.
I was sad that we'd missed Morocco. But it turned out everyone had missed Morocco. There had been an anti-American demonstration in the streets of Casablanca, spurred by the inflammatory film "Innocence of Muslims," and a decision had been made to skip that port and spend the day at sea. Yet another reason, for some, to travel by cruise ship, in the protected and rarefied environment of a floating hotel.
My husband, Alan, and I had never taken a commercial cruise, so we were a little apprehensive. Would we feel trapped? Isolated? We're so A.D.D. - it's not just our children who bring their iPhones to the table. As it happened, I'd already lost mine at the Air France gate at LAX, which I took as a sign. But would Alan get seasick? It didn't occur to me that I would. Would we be accosted in what seemed to us a communal adventure with 1,200 strangers, or would we be able to carve out a place of our own?
Statuesque and streamlined - reminiscent of the first time I saw a 747 on a runway - the M.S. Riviera hit the seas four months ago, the newest in the Oceania Cruises fleet. M.S. Riviera stands for Motor Ship Riviera, but as if it were a vanity California license plate, I instantly transformed it to Ms. and claimed her as my own.
As we entered the double-height lobby with a sweeping staircase and a brilliant over-the-top crystal chandelier, some childlike gene kicked in, as if we'd been shipped off to high-end summer camp. Thoughts of Disneyland and the impish Eloise at the Plaza came to mind. Although I don't know what anyone would have thought of me if I'd actually "skittered" down the hallway.
A hint of luxury as we entered our cabin: a white orchid that seemed strangely at home on the water; a plate of Mediterranean figs and the sweetest wild strawberries; Wi-Fi, a little bit slow; a high-definition flat screen TV for news and entertainment in case you wanted to check out or, conversely, stay in touch, which somewhat countered the fear of claustrophobia and isolation; Bulgari soaps and bath salts; a duvet cover I wish I owned; and sliding glass doors out onto a terrace and a spectacular view of the ever changing waters of the Mediterranean Sea. Color of the sea in Valencia: sky blue.
Did I mention Vijay the butler, who would appear as if on tiptoe every morning with a white tablecloth and the breakfast of your choice? There was a kind of "Upstairs Downstairs" feeling to it all, and we tipped him practically every time he knocked on the door, although he didn't seem to expect it.
Our first night at dinner, when my Iberian (local, acorn-fed) pork chop arrived, another childhood memory kicked in, and I thought, "I wish I had some . . . ," just as the waiter magically appeared and said, 'Would you like some . . . applesauce?' " I felt like I was home.
There was a flash of light outside the stateroom curtains - that impish gene kicked in again as I quietly dressed and made my way to the top deck. The pitch-black sky lit up in a panoramic view of lightning strikes, like a well-timed electrical grid. It was incredible, until I realized, after a moment, that even though the captain was steering away from the storm, the storm might have other ideas, and it might not be the best idea to be on the highest point in the ocean in the middle of an electrical storm. But the ship had "wings" - a computer-controlled hydraulic stabilizing system - and back in the cabin, except for the streaks of light behind the curtains, we never felt as if we were in the midst of a storm at sea.
In Barcelona, after the rain had stopped, Alan and I went off on our own to the 600-year-old Barcelona Cathedral. It is the resting place of Santa Eulalia, who is guarded by 13 white geese because she died at age 13. Its neo-Gothic facade is graced by gargoyles, powerful and haunting renderings of animals both real and imagined, and in the adjacent small museum a display case holds crosses encrusted with emeralds, sapphires and diamonds so gothic in size and staggeringly beautiful that it's hard to imagine who had the girth to wear them.
It's a whirlwind way to tour six cities - the museums, churches, restaurants of your (or their) choosing - without the bother of having to pack and unpack. But there's also a secret inside the Ms. Riviera: the "Culinary Discovery Tours," hosted by the C.I.A.-trained chef Kathryn Kelly. (C.I.A., by the way, stands for Culinary Institute of America, and I wish I could put either of the C.I.A.'s in front of my name.) Chef Kelly is plain-spoken, direct, 5-foot-10 and imposing with her chef's jacket, blond hair and porcelain skin. And she has a surprising sense of humor.
A small van of 24 guests (couples, sisters, home chefs, all bound by a love of food) led by Chef Kelly and a local tour guide drove to the port city of Marseille and stopped at an outdoor farmers' market. She gave out a shopping list, ingredients to be used for that afternoon's cooking class on the ship, and doled out a small allowance. As we left the bus, she said, "Be back in 20 minutes." I came in under budget and gave her back my change. Chef Kelly inspires honesty.
The tour guide was conversant in architecture, too. She pointed out the iconic Le Corbusier apartment building - with its Mir-like facade of red-orange, turquoise and yellow blocks constructed between 1946 and 1952 - and I realized that it informed some of the work Frank Gehry went on to do in Los Angeles. I felt as if I'd already learned something that day. The van turned off the highway, past grape fields and hidden chateaus and herds of sheep that appear like Impressionist paintings on the landscape, down a dirt road to our destination, the Cassis Bodin winery at Chateu de Fontblanche, which dates back to the 17th century. Here, Chef Gui Gedda, who is 80 and perky as ever, had prepared a lunch worthy of a Michelin star or the Cannes festival, whose kitchen he ran for a number of years. As we sipped ros in the back rustic patio (actually, it was noon and I was drinking sparkling water) with a view of the grape fields a few feet away, we all felt as if we were very much "inside" Provence.
Chef Kelly's instructional method is a bit like a Russian ballet teacher's. There is a precise way to cut a shallot! Two to a station, the students had sinks, cutting boards and stove tops of their own. At the front of the class, Chef Kelly was live-screened, Food Network-style, her culinary expertise on view for her students behind her. Ratatouille was on the menu, and as one of her students, a Chinese woman who luckily had a sense of humor, added the eggplant and zucchini, the chef screamed, "This is not wok cooking." That was followed by an expert lesson in a perfect chicken aux fines herbes.+
There is also a library on the ship. Philippa Gregory was popular by the pool. But I was reading "Boomerang: Travels in the New Third World," Michael Lewis's genius but oddly pitched travelogue of the hot spots of the economic meltdown - an interesting choice as it was an interesting time to be visiting Spain and Italy. In many of the shops and restaurants, fears about the economy were palpable, and the euro was descending daily. But except for one conversation I overheard about the "imminent collapse" of the health care system, the boat didn't seem quite so anxious.
A celebrity sighting at sea - there were whispers on the deck by the pool: "Bill Gates is in town." "How do you know that?" "Well, there's Paul Allen's boat." I don't know how anyone knew they might be traveling together, but the Octopus was discreetly anchored out at sea. Midnight blue and formidable, it has two helicopters and a submarine, which I prefer to think is unarmed and mostly used for underwater fish viewing. We watched as it seemingly changed its mind, turned its engine on and made its way back out to international waters. Not really a celebrity sighting, more like a celebrity boat sighting, but still . . . it gave new meaning to the idea of being able to come and go as you please.
The people on the ship who were having the best time were traveling in packs. There was a Chinese family - a husband, his wife, her sister and brother-in-law, who all live in Amsterdam, and a man they call "uncle" and his wife, who still live in Hong Kong - who took us to dinner the last night and ordered incredibly expensive wine. The patriarch has a business importing French Bordeaux to China. (Yes, it is true that the Chinese are buying most of the French Bordeaux.) He told me that he doesn't travel to America because he said a friend of his went recently and that we "ask too many questions." Having no idea what that meant, I didn't question him further. He didn't give us his card.
It was in the run-up to the national election, and the ambient noise on the ship was somewhat political. My first night I was speaking to a very nice gentleman. I told him I was tired because I'd been to the Democratic convention the week before. His wife interrupted immediately. "Oh dear," she said, "we're not having any luck today, are we?" I turned away for a moment and when I turned back, they were gone. (My fault. I'd broken two rules of social etiquette: never mention politics to a stranger, and always speak to the woman first, especially if you're a woman.) But mostly, like seemed to find like, and there was an air of civility that generated from the top, from the charming and precise Italian captain of the ship, Luca Manzi, an officer and a gentleman.
Captain Manzi comes by his trade honestly, having done a stint in the Italian Navy. A highlight: when we docked in Monaco and were not setting sail that night, he invited Alan and me to the bridge for a glass of Champagne at sunset. The bridge was extraordinary, reminiscent of a high-tech sound studio or Mission Control, absolutely spotless, with the crew in perfectly pressed uniforms and caps. Manzi insists he likes to navigate manually, despite the vast array of computer and radar technology on a console the size of the Ritz. The view out the curved windows was spectacular - the boat show was in town - and the waters of the Mediterranean were deep blue, the color of dark sapphires, which someone told me had to do with the depth of the ocean but which I took to have other, richer connotations.
Later that night on our terrace, we watched a magnificent display of fireworks over the port of Monaco, the Casino de Monte-Carlo lit up on the hill, and I was hit with a certain wistfulness, the way you feel the week before camp is over, a feeling that there was one more stop before you had to return to real life.

HEADLINE: For Obama, No Easy Fix for Convoluted Regulatory System

BYLINE: JESSE EISINGER


HIGHLIGHT: While the rule making will speed up, the core problems with the financial system and its regulators are deeper than personnel and sadly impervious to which party occupies the White House. 

 BODY:
In President Obama's second term, financial regulation would finally appear to have the leverage.
Wall Street spent zillions on Mitt Romney, who had promised to roll back financial reform, and lost. Elizabeth Warren now sits in the world's greatest deliberative body. With the election behind us, regulators are likely to be less intimidated by the specter of being hauled in front of Congress and yelled at, especially by House Republicans.
Already, the Obama administration has been moving to install tougher regulators than it had in the early part of its tenure. The early first-term financial regulatory heads were either conciliators or placeholders. Mary L. Schapiro had to reinvigorate a Securities and Exchange Commission that was demoralized from its failures to catch Bernard L. Madoff and to foresee the financial crisis. Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner had to deal with the 2008 crisis and its aftermath, and sidelined banking accountability. Others - like John G. Walsh, who was the acting comptroller of the currency, and Edward DeMarco, who is the acting director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency - have been perceived by reformers as active roadblocks.
 The second-generation appointees, like the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's Richard Cordray and the new comptroller of the currency, Thomas J. Curry, actually evince a desire to regulate.
What's more, the pace of regulation should accelerate. Regulators have been slow-walking the Dodd-Frank overhaul. Only a third of the rules have been completed - and worse, a third haven't even been proposed, according to the law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell. And it only got worse as we approached the election, because nothing is more abominable to Washington regulators than to become an election issue. If a decision could be ducked or a rule delayed, they did it. At that pace, financial reform would have been completed sometime in the second term of the Sasha Obama administration.
Surely, reformers can now ride in and save the day, right?
Alas, no. While the rule making will speed up, the core problems with the financial system and its regulators are deeper than personnel and sadly impervious to which party occupies the White House. They are bipartisan and structural.
The examples of bipartisan cowardice and ineptitude are legion, but one of the most telling involves a particularly dispiriting disappointment of Ms. Schapiro's tenure at the S.E.C.: the failure to figure out a solution for money market funds, which are able to mask their risk under the current rules. It was a shared fumble, with a Democratic commissioner joining Republicans in proposing more study of the topic in order to issue a report calling for more study.
The structural issues go deeper. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission still exist as two separate agencies, a huge missed opportunity for Dodd-Frank and one borne of politics. The C.F.T.C. is protected (and bashed) by the Senate Agriculture Committee, the S.E.C. by the Senate Banking Committee. Merging the agencies would mean that one of those committees would lose power, so forget about that. Gary Gensler, the head of the commodities commission, has been tough, but has been limited by his agency's paltry resources. And, anyway, these agencies are still run by commissions, not single heads, and they rely on Congress for their financing. It's little surprise that such a structure creates plodding impotence.
"One of the biggest weaknesses of Dodd-Frank is that we failed to look long and hard at true independence of regulators," a frustrated and regretful Senate staff member, who worked on the legislation, told me the other day.
This failure plays out in almost comical ways. The market for credit-default swaps, a common derivative, is unified in the business world, but its regulation is split between the C.F.T.C. and the S.E.C. The solution was to let the C.F.T.C. oversee swap indexes of 10 or more components, with the S.E.C. regulating trades in single-company swaps and - get this - indexes with up to nine components. In the real world, traders go long (or short) indexes of credit-default swaps and hedge with the individual names or vice versa. So, how's that supposed to be overseen? When one agency looks over one half of the trade, the other regulators are mandated to close their eyes, put their hands over their ears and say, "La la la la la la la"? Don't worry: The regulators are hard at work jury-rigging a fix as I write this.
Or take the Volcker Rule, one of the most prominent symbols of the financial overhaul. The rule, which was intended to prevent banks from speculating with money backed by taxpayers, is still not finished almost two and a half years after Dodd-Frank passed. It's the subject of multiple-agency negotiations, which are going about as well as that phrase would suggest. Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, had called on the regulators to finish up by Labor Day. That came and went. Senators Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, and Jeff Merkley, Democrat of Oregon, the authors of the provision,fired off a letter a few weeks ago, urging the regulators to finish their work.
Now, it would be good if regulators were assiduously working to simplify the rule, which is a bloated monstrosity filled with loopholes and exemptions. But they aren't. Instead, they're squabbling over petty turf issues.
In "Bleak House," Dickens wrote of a legal case: "This scarecrow of a suit has, in course of time, become so complicated that no man alive knows what it means." Today, he would set the novel in Congress. Dodd-Frank is so sweeping in scope yet so picayune in application that it will be close to impossible for the public to tell whether it's making a difference.
No second term can alter that.

HEADLINE: There's a Great Way Big Businesses Could Help Small Businesses

BYLINE: ROBB MANDELBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: In recent years, big corporations have used their size to rewrite the rules for paying the small businesses that supply them. In many cases, terms have gone from 30 days to 90 days. 

 BODY:
We have just published an article exploring what appears to be a burgeoning trend among big businesses: helping small businesses - with loans, mentoring, new opportunities and sometimes a combination of all three. While the story focuses on the efforts of Boston Beer Company, large companies across the commercial spectrum, including financial giants and national retailers, have joined in.
But if you ask Matthew Griffin, a small-business owner in Carmel, Ind., what's the best thing big businesses can do to help small businesses, he would probably say: pay their bills promptly.
Mr. Griffin, owns Baker's Edge, which makes serpentine baking pans ("The Brownie Pan for Edge Lovers!") sold at specialty kitchen stores and some catalogs. In 2009, he said, several of the retailers he sells to announced in mid-contract that they were changing their payment terms to 90 days from 30 days, which had been standard. Another one of his retailers, Costco Wholesale, Mr. Griffin said, insisted from the outset that it would pay bills in 60 days.
"I'm burning up my line of credit, paying interest, and they're dragging their feet," said Mr. Griffin, who employs two people directly and said he supports the equivalent of another three to six jobs at the contract factory in Minnesota that makes his pans. "You're the smallest guy on the totem pole, and you feel like you're carrying the largest amount of risk and debt to feed the larger beast."
In recent years, giant companies - and not just retailers - have used their size to rewrite the rules for paying the small businesses that supply them with inventory, products for own their use, and services. And though Mr. Griffin first noticed this after the recession hit, many of the companies engaging in this practice are not exactly hard up for cash.
In early 2011, Jeffrey Leonard, a clean-tech private equity fund manager, wrote in the Washington Monthly that Cisco Systems was increasing its payment time from 30 to 60 days, despite handsome profits and nearly $39 billion in cash on its balance sheet. In June, the Wall Street Journal reported that Apple, Wal-Mart, and Ford Motor Company were among corporations that had increased the amount of time they take to pay vendors. And Costco, which takes 60 days to pay Mr. Griffin, has about $5 billion on hand.
Alan Bubitz, a vice president and general merchandise manager at Costco, said that at that store, payment times to vendors are negotiated and are generally tied to the time it takes to sell the merchandise. "We want to sell the merchandise before we have to pay for it, and in essence the vendor will fund the inventory," Mr. Bubitz said. "So if it takes us 60 days to sell the merchandise, and he wants to be paid in 10, we're sitting on the cost of money. It's not a very good way to do business."
The founder of Boston Beer, Jim Koch, said that when he was starting out, he, too, had difficulty getting customers to pay, which of course rankled him, since many of his customers were "large, well-capitalized businesses, while I was scrounging for money and paying credit card rates."
His solution? He asked his customers if they would pay him in five days rather than 30, just for the first year. "I would explain to them, I'm just starting out," he said, "I'm solid - 'cause you don't want them to think you're going to go broke - but if you pay me faster, I'm going to put it back into Sam Adams, and you'll make more money selling it."
More often than not, Mr. Koch said, simply posing the question worked. If it didn't, he'd offer a 1- percent discount for a five-day payment. "Every company has standard practices around this sort of thing. It doesn't mean it's not negotiable," Mr. Koch said. "There's always someone with discretion, to help you out. Most small businesses don't ask, and if they do, they take the first no. Generally, the first person you deal with doesn't have the discretion to change the policy. Don't take no from somebody who's not authorized to say yes."
You're more likely to get that yes, Mr. Koch said, if you couch the proposition in "win-win" terms. "It doesn't have to be business or financial -- it can be a good deed," he said. "It makes people feel good to say yes. And as a customer, they generally want to see you succeed."
As for the terms Boston Beer sets for its own vendors, a spokesman e-mailed to say that payment is on average 45 days, "but there is a significant range around that average." In our conversation, Mr. Koch said that payment varied by the type of transaction. "Some people you E.F.T." - electronic funds transfer - "money right away, some you pay in 30 days, some we pay in 60 days."
But, he said, the distinction is not based on the vendor's size. And "if somebody asks us to pay them early, then we'll pay them faster," he continued. "We might ask for a 1-percent discount. But like most things, it's ultimately negotiable."
What's been your experience? Are you having problems getting big companies to pay quickly? Have you tried to negotiate with them? And what do you make of Boston Beer's efforts to help small food and beverage businesses?

HEADLINE: What Job Openings Tell Us

BYLINE: CASEY B. MULLIGAN


HIGHLIGHT: A drop in the supply of workers, as much as a drop in demand, can explain the high ratio of unemployed to available jobs, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Casey B. Mulligan is an economics professor at the University of Chicago. He is the author of "The Redistribution Recession: How Labor Market Distortions Contracted the Economy." 
A high ratio of unemployed to job openings means that the unemployed are competing a lot for jobs, many news reports say, when it fact it could indicate the opposite.
It's true that a reduction in labor demand - from, say, a new tax on employers - would motivate employers to get by with fewer employees. As they do, employers would reduce job openings and lay off workers. One result would be fewer job openings and more unemployed people, and thereby more unemployed people per job opening.
But a reduction in labor supply in the form of additional subsidies for unemployed people would have similar effects. Unemployed people would be choosier about the jobs they accept, especially the low-wage ones. With more help for people after layoffs, employers and employees in struggling industries would do less to avoid layoffs, especially layoffs from low-paying positions. Either way the result would be more unemployed people.
Subsidies for unemployed people also make labor more expensive as low-wage jobs are more likely to end by layoff and unemployed people can be choosier about the jobs they take. When labor is more expensive, employers have an incentive to get by with fewer employees and for that reason may well reduce the number of job openings they have.

In this way a reduction in labor supply by itself, a reduction in labor demand by itself or both together can increase the ratio of unemployed to job openings. It makes little sense to point to a high ratio as proof that labor demand is low, because it could just as easily tell us that labor supply is low. All a high ratio tells us is that the labor market has contracted, and that we could readily and more reliably detect without any data on job openings by just looking at the unemployment rate itself, or the ratio of employed to population.
My conclusion is not new to labor economists, who have long understood that supply factors could increase the ratio of unemployed to job openings. Christopher A. Pissarides, a professor at the London School of Economics, literally wrote the book on job openings and unemployment, and his book explains how more generous unemployment compensation would have these effects (see Figure 9.2 from his latest edition; I thank my colleague Robert Shimer for this reference).
The black series in the chart below shows the ratio of unemployed to job openings. The chart also shows in red the marginal tax rate on labor income (the extra taxes paid, and subsidies forgone, as a result of working, expressed as a ratio to the income from working) for a typical head of household or spouse based on the ever-changing eligibility and benefit rules for safety-net programs. The ratio increases fastest between the first half of 2008 and the first half of 2009, just when the marginal tax rate series increases the most. Both series peak in late 2010 and decline thereafter. Neither series has returned to its prerecession level.
For the reasons mentioned above, the chart is by no means proof that supply was a major factor during the recession. That proof requires other sorts of analyses, which are shown in my book.
Nevertheless Paul Krugman continues to cite the high ratio of unemployed to job openings as evidence that demand, rather than supply, contracted the labor market: "There are now four job seekers for every job opening, which means that workers who lose one job find it very hard to get another" (see Page 9 of "End This Depression Now!"). He and other economics commentators citing this fact never explain why the very same ratio should not be interpreted as a drop in supply, or as a combination of reduced supply and reduced demand. Instead they contend that the labor market would rebound with still more help for the unemployed.
Believe it or not, Keynesian economics is not the only way to interpret the job openings data.

HEADLINE: Romney Blames Loss on Obama 'Gifts'

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: The president, Mr. Romney said in a call with donors, won by "giving targeted groups a big gift." 

 BODY:
Now we know that Mitt Romney did not "misspeak" when he whined to a big-money crowd that 47 percent of Americans mooch off government and "believe they are victims." He meant precisely what he said.
In a post-mortem call with his biggest donors on Wednesday, Mr. Romney said his team ran a "superb" campaign with "no drama" (well, yes, it was a pretty dull campaign) and that he lost because President Obama showered voters with "gifts." By voters he meant black, Hispanic, female and young voters. And by "gifts," he meant government money that is not spent on tax breaks and other incentives for big companies and rich people.
He said Mr. Obama motivated young voters by keeping student-loan interest rates low and by extending dependent health insurance coverage to age 26. According to the Times account of the call, Mr. Romney said Mr. Obama's health care plan also mobilized African-American and Hispanic voters. "You can imagine for somebody making $25,000 or $30,000 or $35,000 a year, being told you're now going to get free health care, particularly if you don't have it, getting free health care worth, what, $10,000 per family in perpetuity, I mean this is huge," Mr. Romney said.

He is right. It is huge. A hugely overdue and hugely necessary reform of a system that has left Americans at the bottom of the economic ladder with emergency rooms as their source of medical care. How crafty of Mr. Obama to pretend that he was governing when what he was really doing was handing out "gifts" in exchange for votes.
But that's not all. "Free contraceptives were very big with young college-aged women," Mr. Romney said, making it sound as though the president had distributed condoms with a t-shirt gun at a frat party (actually he mandated that non-religious institutions provide contraceptive coverage as part of their health care packages).
"The president's campaign," he said, "focused on giving targeted groups a big gift - so he made a big effort on small things. Those small things, by the way, add up to trillions of dollars."
Mr. Romney is so irrelevant now that's it tempting to let his comments gather dust on the remainder table of history. But I thought a few points were worth making. First, none of these examples qualify as actual gifts. Some, like keeping interest rates low on student debt, are smart investments to help young people succeed and become - yes, taxpayers. Others, like health care reform, require Americans to spend money (on insurance, or pay a penalty).
I guess Mr. Romney would not consider oil subsidies a gift. Or a tax system that allows him to pay a 14 percent tax rate. Or his proposal to build warships and warplanes and other fancy hardware that the military doesn't want or need.
The sad fact is that Mr. Romney is not out of touch with the Republicans' post-election ramblings. It seems like no one in his party has figured out that it wasn't "gifts" or bad luck that caused him to lose. It was his ideas.

HEADLINE: The New Japanese Worker is Chinese

BYLINE: ALEXANDRA HARNEY


HIGHLIGHT: Why are Chinese coming to Japan, an expensive country they are raised to dislike, with an economy that's shrinking while China's is expanding? 

 BODY:
TOKYO - These days Japan's newsstands are filled with shrill, hyperbolic and sometimes nationalistic titles about China. "The China Risk." "The End of China." "China: Withdraw or Stay the Course." Such headlines reflect the anxiety of a declining nation that fears its rising neighbor.
And yet, without debate or comment, Japan is opening its arms to Chinese immigrants as never before, relying on Chinese workers to fill jobs once reserved for locals, especially in the service sector. No one in Tokyo seems surprised anymore to hear a Chinese accent or see a Chinese name on the name tags of waiters or convenience-store clerks.
Among Japan's small foreign population, there are now more Chinese - 674,879 as of last year, according to Japanese government data - than people from any other country. That's about 10 times as many Chinese as were here in 1984, according to the Ministry of Justice.
Why have so many Chinese wound up in Japan, an expensive country many of them are raised to dislike, with an economy that's shrinking while China's is expanding? And why are so many staying, given worsening relations between the two countries?
The number of foreign workers in Japan remains small: They account for less than one percent of all workers. But the changing composition of the foreign workforce reveals a subtle evolution in Japan's labor market and popular attitudes.
Most Chinese workers come through the back door, as exchange students or under vocational training programs. Han (she asked that I not use her last name), a 22-year-old student from the northeastern Chinese city of Shenyang who turned down a place at a Chinese university, said she never intended to come here. She had hoped to study in the United States. But tuition there was beyond her parents' budget, and they worried about crime. Japan was closer, safer and cheaper. Plus, her uncle had lived here for years.
When they enroll in a Japanese language school, Chinese (and other) exchange students are also entitled to work 28 hours a week. But the rules are poorly enforced, a Japanese government official told me, and so many students hold more than one job and work longer hours. Han talks of classrooms of sleeping Chinese students. At the Tokyo convenience store where she works part-time, her colleagues and bosses are Chinese.
Han is still hoping to find her way to the United States or Canada, but some Chinese workers in Japan stay for a few years, save aggressively and go home. Others come here to find a husband and get a Japanese passport: About 58 percent of the Chinese living in Japan are women, according to Japanese government statistics.
Japanese companies say they are hiring more foreigners, particularly Chinese, to bring their practices closer to international norms and cultivate employees who understand both the Japanese and Chinese markets. Hiring foreigners can help keep down costs, not only for stores and restaurants in cities like Tokyo, but also for manufacturers in the automotive and electronics sectors.
More significant still, Chinese workers are not confined to working in factories in rural areas; now they're in front-line service-sector jobs in big cities. They're out in the open, serving politicians and executives in restaurants, wearing the uniforms of Japanese companies - generally doing jobs that two decades ago would have rarely been left to foreigners from any country. Back in the early 2000s, one senior Japanese airline executive told me that Japanese airlines would never join international alliances because Japanese customers had special service needs and didn't feel comfortable being served by foreign flight attendants.
If Japanese customers are now willing to accept more foreigners working for retailers and in restaurants, why not in other service roles, like nursing and elderly care?
A Japanese journalist friend argues that Japan has been able to allow more foreigners in because it hasn't openly debated its immigration policy. A frank discussion would only awaken immigration's opponents, he says.
But it may be time to face the issue squarely. A country where almost one-quarter of the population is over 65 and the workforce has been shrinking since 1998 must do more than open its back door to part-time foreign workers. It should throw open the front door and maybe even a few windows. Japan needs to give more foreign workers more reasons to build their lives here.

HEADLINE: When a Green Job Is More Than a Green Job

BYLINE: SARAH CREAN


HIGHLIGHT: Participants in a training program in the South Bronx gain something beyond job skills. 

 BODY:
Can a community like the South Bronx, which suffers from high unemployment, underinvestment and so-called environmental injustice, fit into the green economy? In 2010 a union-backed training initiative took on the question, enrolling unemployed residents, including many who had served time in prison, in a green jobs certification program.
Two and a half years and 400-plus graduates later, the Center for Environmental Workforce Training has had some gratifying results. Half of the center's graduates have gone on to find jobs, for example.
Over a third of those hired are working in the energy efficiency field, mostly with companies doing efficiency upgrades for residential and commercial buildings. Another third have found ostensibly green jobs in areas like building maintenance, construction, repairs, sustainable manufacturing and landscaping. The rest of those hired are in occupations that would not be classified as environmentally related.
But as the project's director, Rebecca Lurie, sees it, "one day, every job will be a green job.'' In her view, work activity will have to shift in coming years toward conserving natural resources or, at a minimum, not harming the environment.
The South Bronx-based training center, a collaboration between the Consortium for Worker Education and six partner organizations that is supported by a Recovery Act grant, offers training in "hard" and "soft" skills, from mechanical theory to basic plumbing to upgrading electrical systems for energy efficiency. The curriculum also includes courses on seeking and holding down a job and on environmental literacy.
Students have the option of obtaining certification as energy efficiency technicians or building analysts, among other green occupations.
Ms. Lurie, who is the economic development director for the Consortium for Worker Education, said that PlaNYC, the Bloomberg administration's far-reaching sustainability plan for the city, provided some of the impetus for the training program. Many in the organized labor and job development fields had questions, she noted, like "How is the work force going to be ready to carry this plan out?"
She said that groups like her own had determined that making New York's buildings more energy-efficient would be an important source of jobs in coming years. One of her goals was figuring out how to open up that opportunity up to a broader range of city residents: "Can we get poor, unemployed people skilled up to meet those demands?"
Ms. Lurie said it was clear to her organization that there were skill gaps among those at the lower socioeconomic levels. "You need lots of math and science," she said. "We designed classes to fill these particular gaps." And at the fundamental level, the participants need construction skills, "to know how buildings are built."
Because of the recession, local green jobs in fields like weatherization and renewable energy did not materialize to the extent organizers had hoped, she said. Nonetheless, center graduates are working their way into segments of the green economy.
They benefit financially by doing so: an analysis of the jobs obtained by the center's graduates showed that the average hourly wage for those with green jobs was $13.51. For nongreen jobs, it was $10.94.
The consortium has also begun to examine how the training program may have influenced students' lifestyles and thinking. A survey conducted this fall found that the percentage who reported shopping at farmers' markets had doubled by the time they finished the coursework. The students also said that they were conserving more energy and water and thinking about how they disposed of consumer goods like appliances and clothing.
"After a week or two, I realized how much energy I am wasting - little things like cellphone chargers plugged into your wall," one graduate, Sean Brailsford, said in a phone interview. It "taught me how to conserve and be less wasteful."
Mr. Brailsford found his way into the program through the Osborne Association, a nonprofit group that offers job training and placement and other services to New Yorkers who have passed through the criminal justice system. Before enrolling, he said, he had no green knowledge or experience, but "I was ready for some more growth and change."
After completing the program, Mr. Brailsford was hired by Osborne to help track graduates and job placement.
The federal grant that supported the training center's creation in 2010 is now winding down. Ms. Lurie said that three of the center's partner organizations - Osborne, Sustainable South Bronx and Non-Traditional Employment for Women - are positioned to carry the training forward with other funds. She said the biggest benefit of the federal grant was the development of a strong curriculum.
The program introduces students to basic concepts. "We are helping guys get their foot into the door," said Alvin Banks, a center graduate who now teaches construction skills like framing and electrical wiring at Osborne. "Students have varying degrees of knowledge - they are being made employable."
As for green principles, students learn that they make economic sense, Mr. Banks said. "You want to help your boss conserve material," he explained. "I try to convey how to best do the job effectively and efficiently."
For participants who have served time, the introduction to new ways of thinking can be just as important as hard skills, he suggested. Mr. Banks himself spent nine and a half years in prison for bank and wire fraud and identity theft before finding his way, through a city referral, to Osborne and the center.
"When a person has been incarcerated, their ability to think on their own has been suppressed," he said. "Once people are exposed to green ideology, people are like, 'wow' -- you start to rethink."
"It's the little things, conscious decisions of behavior," he said.

HEADLINE: Romney Blames Loss on Obama's 'Gifts' to Minorities and Young Voters

BYLINE: ASHLEY PARKER


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney said that President Obama had followed the "old playbook" of wooing specific interest groups - "especially the African-American community, the Hispanic community and young people," - with targeted gifts and initiatives. 

 BODY:
Saying that he and his team still felt "troubled" by his loss to President Obama, Mitt Romney on Wednesday attributed his defeat in part to what he called big policy "gifts" that the president had bestowed on loyal Democratic constituencies, including young voters, African-Americans and Hispanics. 
In a conference call with fund-raisers and donors to his campaign, Mr. Romney said Wednesday afternoon that the president had followed the "old playbook" of using targeted initiatives to woo specific interest groups - "especially the African-American community, the Hispanic community and young people." 
"In each case, they were very generous in what they gave to those groups," Mr. Romney said, contrasting Mr. Obama's strategy to his own of "talking about big issues for the whole country: military strategy, foreign policy, a strong economy, creating jobs and so forth."
Mr. Romney's comments in the 20-minute conference call came after his running mate, Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, toldWISC-TV in Madison on Monday that their loss was a result of Mr. Obama's strength in "urban areas," an analysis that did not account for Mr. Obama's victories in more rural states like Iowa and New Hampshire or the decrease in the number of votes for the president relative to 2008 in critical urban counties in Ohio.
"With regards to the young people, for instance, a forgiveness of college loan interest was a big gift," Mr. Romney said. "Free contraceptives were very big with young, college-aged women. And then, finally, Obamacare also made a difference for them, because as you know, anybody now 26 years of age and younger was now going to be part of their parents' plan, and that was a big gift to young people. They turned out in large numbers, a larger share in this election even than in 2008."

The president's health care plan, he said, was also a useful tool in mobilizing black and Hispanic voters. Though Mr. Romney won the white vote with 59 percent, according to exit polls, minorities coalesced around the president in overwhelming numbers: 93 percent of blacks and 71 percent of Hispanics. 
"You can imagine for somebody making $25,000 or $30,000 or $35,000 a year, being told you're now going to get free health care, particularly if you don't have it, getting free health care worth, what, $10,000 per family, in perpetuity - I mean, this is huge," Mr. Romney said. "Likewise with Hispanic voters, free health care was a big plus. But in addition with regards to Hispanic voters, the amnesty for children of illegals, the so-called Dream Act kids, was a huge plus for that voting group." 
Nationwide, Mr. Obama won a slightly smaller share of 18- to 29-year-old voters than he did in 2008, according to exit polls, though he increased his share in battleground states like Florida, Ohio and Virginia. Exit pollsshowed little appreciable difference between Mr. Obama's performance among black voters nationwide and in many swing states in this election and in 2008. Among Hispanic voters nationwide, Mr. Obama won a greater share in 2012 than in 2008, but perhaps more important, he succeeded in increasing the share of Hispanic voters among the total voting population in key states, including Colorado and Nevada, exit polls showed. 
During the call, Mr. Romney was by turns disappointed and pragmatic, expressing his frustration at the outcome on Election Day. A person who was on the call, which included hundreds of participants, let The New York Times listen in.
"I'm very sorry that we didn't win," Mr. Romney said on the call. "I know that you expected to win, we expected to win, we were disappointed with the result, we hadn't anticipated it, and it was very close, but close doesn't count in this business." 
He continued: "And so now we're looking and saying, 'O.K., what can we do going forward?' But frankly, we're still so troubled by the past, it's hard to put together our plans for the future." 
He added that he was hoping to find a way for the close-knit group, which excelled in fund-raising but was ultimately unable to propel him into the Oval Office, "to stay connected so that we can stay informed and have influence on the direction of the party, and perhaps the selection of a future nominee, which, by the way, will not be me." (He suggested an annual meeting, as well as a monthly newsletter.)
In a news conference of his own Wednesday, Mr. Obama, asked if he still planned to meet with Mr. Romney for a postelection discussion, spoke positively of his former opponent, saying that he "did a terrific job of running the Olympics," and that he appreciated Mr. Romney's ideas on government efficiency. 
"I'm not either prejudging what he's interested in doing, nor am I suggesting I've got some specific assignment," the president said, when asked about Mr. Romney. "But what I want to do is to get ideas from him and see if there are some ways that we can potentially work together."

HEADLINE: Player Ratings: Russia (2), U.S. (2)

BYLINE: JACK BELL


HIGHLIGHT: Rating the performance of U.S. players in an international friendly against Russia on Wednesday. 

 BODY:
The United States snatched an uneven tie against Russia in Krasnodar on Wednesday thanks to a goal in second-half injury time by Mix Diskerud. The match was the final one on the U.S. schedule this year as it looks ahead to the final round of regional World Cup qualifying matches that begin at Honduras on Feb. 6.
For Coach Jurgen Klinsmann, the primary task was cobbling together a coherent and consistent defense, something that eluded the American team at Kuban Stadium.
 Final Score: Russia 2, U.S. 2
 The Ratings (on a scale of 1, diabolical; to 10, world class):
 U.S. 
 Goalkeeper 
 Tim Howard 
Key diving save early in the first half preserved one-goal deficit. Was left naked on Russia's opening score. Then two acrobatic saves in the 67th minute kept the U.S. in the match. Last line of a rickety defense. No chance on late Russia penalty. Grade: 9 
 Defenders 
 Timmy Chandler 
Back with the U.S. after a long hiatus of more than a year. Will he or won't he commit to the U.S.? We probably will not know for sure until he steps on the field for the U.S. in World Cup qualifier at Honduras on Feb. 6. Active going forward in the first half. Part of the problem on defense in second half. Grade: 5 
 Geoff Cameron 
Giveaway in own end minutes after Russia scored that nearly led to a second. Big, fit and reads the game well. Part of a pretty shaky defense that provided Russia with too many good chances. Grade: 4 
 Carlos Bocanegra 
Cap No. 114 lasted all of 15 minutes. Lifted after sustaining a leg injury Grade: Incomplete 

 Fabian Johnson 
Rush forward and chip to Altidore should have been in the back of the net. Late foul on edge of area cost the U.S. dearly. Grade: 4 
 Clarence Goodson 
Entered the match in first quarter-hour after Bocanegra came up lame. Took a pass from Williams at top of Russia's box, but hit a weak shot right at the goalkeeper midway through first half. Another near-giveaway on a quick free kick. Late takedown in penalty area from quick free kick gave Russia the PK that nearly doomed the U.S. Grade: 3 
 Midfielders 
 Danny Williams 
His quick free kick in the 10th minute was way, way too quick. Giveaway led directly to first Russia goal. Critical mistake. Whiffed trying to hit a clearance at top of U.S. penalty area and nearly led to another goal. Decent defensive effort in an overly defensive midfield array. Grade: 3 
 Jermaine Jones 
U.S. suffers when he tries to do too much with the ball. Provides bite and a big body in the midfield, but you have to wonder if, at his age, he will be around should the U.S. qualify for the 2014 World Cup. Skied a shot from a nice pass from Altidore in the 82nd. Grade: 5 
 Michael Bradley 
One nice lead pass early, then took a yellow card in the 26th for a late tackle from behind. Quiet first half. Picked it up in the second half. Rewarded when he scored his 11th international goal ... hitting a volley from an Agudelo header that kissed off the near post and bounded into the goal. U.S. thrives when he is deeply committed, as he was in the second 45 minutes. U.S. rises or falls on his shoulders. Fact. Grade: 7 
 Josh Gatt 
First senior team cap. Won another title with Molde in Norway, playing for the former Manchester United star Ole-Gunnar Solskjaer. Some nervous touches early on, but created some chances with his speed on the right. Then flopped sides with Gomez midway through first half. Replaced by Agudelo in 63rd minute. Credible debut, bringing some speed to the flanks. Grade: 7 
 Sacha Kljestan 
Replaced Gomez in the 65th. Head up, slides a pass down the flank to Altidore in stride. Economy on the ball and touch passing after entering the match. Grade: 7 
 Maurice Edu 
Replaced Williams in 73rd minute. No impact. Grade: 5 
 Mix Diskerud 
Late sub for Cameron. Late goal from a deflection after a shot from the top of the area in second-half injury time. First senior international goal. Not bad. Nice hair. Grade: 7 
 Forwards 
 Herculez Gomez 
Saw little of the ball in the first half, playing first on the left then the right flank. Never really found a comfort level in the match. Grade: 4 
 Jozy Altidore 
Question remains whether he can consistently translate success on the club level (12 goals so far this season in all competitions for AZ in the Netherlands) into success for the national team. Chested down a nice diagonal pass from Jones in the 38th minute and lashed a slicing right-footed shot high from about 30 yards. First touch eluded him, badly, on deft chip from Johnson in 70th. Tracking back on defense. Better, but not great. Grade: 5 
 Juan Agudelo 
Back on Klinsmann's team after a lost 2012, both for country and club (after trade from Red Bulls to Chivas USA in M.L.S.). Replaced Gatt in 63rd minute. Soft header to Bradley set up U.S. equalizer. Grade: 6 
 Terrance Boyd 
Late replacement for Altidore. Grade: Incomplete 
 Coach 
 Jurgen Klinsmann 
Dispensed with the lone striker on the road to pair Altidore and Gomez up top at the start. Looks like he read Jones and Bradley the riot act at halftime after their rather static play in the first half. Brought Altidore back into the team, gave Gatt his first senior start. Biggest problem? Defense. Grade 6 
 Substitutes/Did Not Play 
 Nick Rimando (GK)

HEADLINE: Republican Governors Say Party Needs to Rebuild

BYLINE: JEFF ZELENY


HIGHLIGHT: Republican governors in Las Vegas for a two-day meeting lamented the party's failure to win the White House and a majority of the Senate, and called for a new approach. 

 BODY:
LAS VEGAS - A proctological exam.
 That is what Haley Barbour said the Republican Party should undergo after losing the race for the White House and allowing a chance to control the Senate slip away.
 "We've got to give our political organization a very serious proctology exam," Mr. Barbour said Wednesday. "We need to look everywhere."
 The blunt assessment from Mr. Barbour, one of the party's most influential elders, was delivered here during the fall meeting of the Republican Governors Association. He called for a top-to-bottom review of the party's ground game, which he said was outmaneuvered by the organization built by President Obama's campaign.
 "We have to look at everything in depth," Mr. Barbour said, "and be brutally honest." 
 A week after Mitt Romney fell short in his bid for the White House, Republican leaders offered tepid praise of his candidacy. But they quickly moved on and called for a new approach to the party's rebuilding efforts.
 Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin said Republicans needed to adopt a new "tone."
 Gov. Robert F. McDonnell of Virginia said Democrats had consistently done "a better job explaining" their economic argument.
Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana said: "We need to modernize our party."

As Republicans arrived here on Wednesday for a two-day gathering, the party celebrated its achievement of controlling 30 governor's offices across the country. But they spent more time lamenting their failure to win the White House and a majority of Senate seats.
A fresh batch of comments from Mr. Romney quickly became the topic of conversation here on Wednesday afternoon, after it was reported that Mr. Romney told members of his national finance committee in a conference call that Mr. Obama had followed the "old playbook" of wooing particular interest groups. On the call, Mr. Romney expanded on his remark and said that the administration was "very generous in what they gave to those groups" - "especially the African-American community, the Hispanic community and young people."
As he spoke to reporters here, Mr. Jindal reacted sharply to Mr. Romney's remarks.
"I absolutely reject that notion. I don't think that represents where we are as a party," Mr. Jindal said. He added, "We have got to stop dividing the American voters."

HEADLINE: Filling Up On Your Dime

BYLINE: By JAMES R. ALM and JAY A. SOLED. 
James R. Alm is a professor of economics at Tulane. Jay A. Soled is a professor of accounting and information systems at Rutgers Business School.

 BODY:
GASOLINE prices have been falling in recent months, and the International Energy Agency just reported that the United States will overtake Saudi Arabia to be the world's leading oil producer in about five years. But it's too early to celebrate.
The next time you fill up your tank, you should know that the person next to you might be paying much less than you for gasoline. By reporting their personal automobile use as a business expense, millions of drivers are essentially getting taxpayer subsidies for their gasoline. 
The tax code treats expenses incurred in the ''ordinary and necessary'' course of doing business as tax-deductible, including costs like gasoline, tolls, parking and vehicle depreciation. Consider a salesman visiting a client or a lawyer driving from her office to court. Depending on factors like her tax filing status, whether she itemizes her deductions, and whether she is self-employed, her savings could be as much as 35 percent -- or $1.20 for every $3.50 of gasoline.
The deduction can't be taken for personal auto usage, like grocery trips, vacation travel and, importantly, commuting.
But about 10 million drivers break these rules every year, according to the Internal Revenue Service. More than 60 percent of the 16 million taxpayers who claim business-related auto expenses each year do so inaccurately. Some errors benefit the government, as when taxpayers mistakenly classify business-related expenses as personal ones. But the net result is a loss of about $6 billion in annual tax revenue.
These losses have been piling up for decades. In 1984, Congress took measures to curb them, including requiring taxpayers to maintain written records of their business-related auto use. But just one year later, after an outcry over the onerousness of the new paperwork requirements, most of them were repealed. Since then, politicians have turned a blind eye to the problem.
Self-employed small-business owners are frequent violators, but not the only ones. One case settled in 2011 involved a professor of criminal justice at Rowan University who claimed to have driven 18,000 miles ''on business'' and took more than $7,000 of auto-related deductions. In fact, the government asserted that his only business expenses were eight trips between Rowan and Temple University, less than 25 miles away, and denied the deductions. In a 2009 case, a sales consultant in Miami claimed more than $10,000 in auto-related business expenses, but when the I.R.S. challenged the deductions, she could not offer any concrete evidence for her claims. (The court ruled against her.)
However egregious the cases, these violators were the exception only in that they were caught. It took costly I.R.S. audits and court proceedings to catch them, and since only 1 percent of taxpayers are audited, many slip through the cracks. With salary payments and bank interest earnings, third parties like employers, banks and brokerage firms issue ''information returns'' (through W-2 and 1099 forms, for instance) can corroborate taxpayers' reports on their returns. But there is no outside party available to monitor whether a taxpayer's automobile use is business or personal in nature.
Even worse, the tax deduction for gasoline creates bad incentives. It encourages violators to buy less fuel-efficient vehicles, to live farther from their workplaces than they otherwise would, and to take longer and more frequent leisure trips. All of this not only harms our environment and deepens our dependence on foreign oil but also increases the price of gasoline. Indeed, we estimate that, based on current levels of demand and supply, the added demand by noncompliant taxpayers drives up average gasoline prices by an estimated 5 to 10 cents a gallon, at least in the short run.
What can be done? Congress can start by simplifying the deductibility rules and exceptions that currently confront drivers. It should also require more detailed expense reporting by taxpayers who use their cars for work; institute stricter requirements for write-offs; cap total auto-related deductions; and stiffen penalties for violators. (Thanks to technology, keeping track of business-related auto travel is far easier now than it was in the 1980s.) Congress might even go further and limit deductible car expenses to employers who actually own the vehicles in question and use them almost exclusively for business. These measures might be unpalatable, especially to some small-business owners, but they deserve examination.
Beyond the revenue, there is the matter of fairness. Americans who are already struggling to cover their commuting costs shouldn't have to pay even more at the pump to subsidize those motorists who are filling up on their dime.

HEADLINE: Obama Meets C.E.O.'s as Fiscal Reckoning Nears

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER and NELSON D. SCHWARTZ; Helene Cooper reported from Washington and Nelson D. Schwartz from New York. Jackie Calmes contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama extended an olive branch to business leaders Wednesday, seeking their support as he prepared to negotiate with Congressional Republicans over the fiscal impasse in Washington.
If Congress and the president cannot reach a deal to reduce the deficit by January, more than $600 billion in tax increases and spending cuts will go into effect immediately -- a prospect many chief executives and others warn could tip the economy back into recession.
Even so, Mr. Obama has some fence-mending to do before he can count on any serious backing from the business community. 
''The president brought up that he hadn't always had the best relationship with business, and he didn't think he deserved that, but he understood that's where things were and wanted it to be better,'' said David M. Cote, chief executive of Honeywell. He was one of a dozen corporate leaders invited to meet Mr. Obama at the White House for 90 minutes Wednesday afternoon, after the president's first news conference since the election.
While Mr. Obama did not present a detailed plan at Wednesday's meeting or reveal what he would propose in terms of new corporate taxes, he strongly reiterated that he would not allow tax cuts for the middle class to expire. The president, according to attendees and aides, said he was committed to a balanced approach of reductions in entitlements and other government spending and increases in revenue.
With time running out, many people expect the president and Republican leaders in Congress to come up with a short-term compromise that prevents the full slate of tax increases and spending cuts from hitting in January. That would give both sides more time to come up with a far-reaching deal on entitlement spending, even as they work on a broad tax overhaul later next year.
One corporate official briefed on the meeting said that the chief executives came away with a sense that Mr. Obama was poised to present a more formal proposal in the next few days, but that he did not press them for support on particular policies. ''It was more of a back and forth,'' he said.
The chief executives from some of the country's biggest and best-known companies, including Procter & Gamble and I.B.M., were not unified on everything, according to one who was interviewed after the meeting.
Many of the executives who described the meeting would speak only on condition of anonymity.
The outreach to business comes as both the White House and corporate America maneuver ahead of the year-end deadline, as well as the beginning of Mr. Obama's second term. Many executives were put off by what they saw as antibusiness rhetoric coming from the White House in his first term, and many also oppose tax increases on the rich that Mr. Obama favors but would hit them personally.
Both sides have plenty to gain from a better relationship. Business leaders want to buffer their image after the recession and the financial crisis, while Mr. Obama would gain valuable leverage if he could persuade even a few chief executives to come out in favor of higher taxes on people with incomes over $250,000.
Lloyd C. Blankfein, chief executive of Goldman Sachs, publicly endorsed higher tax rates in an opinion article published in The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday.
''I believe that tax increases, especially for the wealthiest, are appropriate, but only if they are joined by serious cuts in discretionary spending and entitlements,'' he wrote.
While Mr. Blankfein and other Wall Street leaders have been speaking out about the dangers of the fiscal impasse, only one executive from the financial services industry, Kenneth I. Chenault of American Express, was at Wednesday's meeting.
Afterward, the corporate leaders seemed pleased with the tone of the meeting but cautious about the prospect of finding common ground with the White House on the budget choices facing Congress and the president.
''I'd say everybody came away feeling pretty good about the whole discussion,'' Mr. Cote said. ''Now, all of us are C.E.O.'s, so we've learned not to confuse words with results. And that's what we still need to see.''
Ursula M. Burns, chief executive of Xerox, who was also at the meeting, said afterward that it was clear that ''we're going to have to work through some sticking points.'' But while ''we didn't get into too many specifics,'' she said, it was also made clear that ''we cannot go over the fiscal cliff.''
Ms. Burns's comments about the potentially dire consequences of the fiscal impasse echoed those of other chief executives, including many in the Business Roundtable, which began an ad campaign Tuesday calling on lawmakers to resolve the issue quickly. The Campaign to Fix the Debt, a new group with a $40 million budget and the support of many Fortune 500 chiefs, began its own ad campaign on Monday.
Michael T. Duke, chief executive of Wal-Mart Stores, warned in a statement after the meeting that ''before the end of the year, Washington needs to find an agreement to avoid the fiscal cliff.'' He said Walmart customers ''are working hard to adapt to the 'new normal,' but their confidence is still very fragile. They are shopping for Christmas now, and they don't need uncertainty over a tax increase.''

HEADLINE: Financial Worries Pile On Long Before Graduation

BYLINE: By RICHARD PREZ-PEA

 BODY:
Money troubles interfere with the academic performance of about one-third of all college students, and a similar number of students regularly skip buying required academic materials because of the costs, according to a survey released on Thursday.
In an era of stagnant incomes and rising tuition and student debt, the burden of college costs on families and former students is well documented. But the new findings, from the National Survey of Student Engagement, show that financial worries are a major source of stress for undergraduates while they are still in school.
About three-fifths of students surveyed reported that they often worry about having enough money to cover ordinary costs, and students who spend the most hours at paying jobs are, not surprisingly, those feeling the most financial stress. Among those who work more than 20 hours a week, about three-fifths said that their jobs got in the way of school work. 
''For far too many students, this is a real obstacle to achievement,'' said Alexander C. McCormick, director of the survey, which included 285,000 students at 577 four-year colleges and universities in the United States and Canada.
Dr. McCormick, an associate professor of education at Indiana University, said money troubles had always existed for some students, but ''since the 2008 recession, it's something we need to view more seriously.''
The survey findings parallel those in studies by the American College Health Association, which show that as a drain on students' mental health, finances rank second only to academics, and ahead of intimate relationships, lack of sleep and family problems. About one-third of students in those surveys say that in the prior year, financial concerns have been ''traumatic or very difficult to handle.''
The National Survey of Student Engagement dates to 2000 and is conducted annually, concentrating primarily on academic issues. The survey does not release scores by institution, but it does show colleges their own results and how they compare with their peers. School administrators have come to see it as a valuable tool for assessing their institutions.
As in the past, this year's survey asked students about practices that research has shown to improve learning, like frequent interaction with professors, collaboration with other students, studying abroad and doing internships. The results showed sharp variations by demographics and major area of study.
Students in sciences like astronomy, biochemistry and physics, for example, were more than twice as likely as their peers in other fields to participate in research with faculty members, and among the least likely to combine their academics with some kind of community service.
Black students were more likely to work collaboratively than those in other racial and ethnic groups. Women spent significantly more hours studying than men did, and students at undergraduate colleges of arts and sciences studied more than those at universities with graduate programs.
For the first time, the survey asked why students chose their majors, and more than half said a central reason was having the skills to find a job and advance a career. Students in science and technology fields were far more likely than others to give that answer, while white students were far less likely than their Hispanic, black or Asian classmates.
This year's survey also looked at the booming population of college students who take their classes online, who tend to be older than traditional college students. It found that the remote learners spent more time studying -- which is consistent with the age difference -- but fell short on many other measures of engagement.

HEADLINE: Justice Dept. Issues Guidance on Overseas Bribes

BYLINE: By CHARLIE SAVAGE

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- With billions of dollars in potential fines and foreign investment in the balance, the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday released long-awaited guidance on how prosecutors interpret and enforce a federal anticorruption law that bans American businesses from bribing officials overseas.
The 120-page ''resource guide'' to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act lays out the government's understanding of and standard practices for the 1977 law. The statute sat largely dormant for decades, but a recent rush of enforcement has brought anxiety to corporate boardrooms, leading to large fees for compliance lawyers and enormous fines and settlements paid to the government. 
The detailed guidance -- including numerous case studies illustrating what would and would not be considered a violation of the law -- is particularly important because cases of foreign corrupt practices rarely get adjudicated. Corporations are generally inclined to settle potential cases without a trial because being indicted can cripple a business.
As a result, judges rarely weigh in on whether prosecutors' interpretation of the statute in ambiguous situations -- like when an employee of a state-owned enterprise, like a utility, should be considered a ''foreign official'' and therefore covered by the law -- is accurate.
The guide -- signed by Lanny A. Breuer, the assistant attorney general for the Justice Department's criminal division, and Robert S. Khuzami, the S.E.C.'s director of enforcement -- lays out a series of factors in considering who counts as a foreign official. Among them, for example, is whether a foreign government controls an entity, like a utility, or has only a minority stake.
It also discusses gift-giving at length, and addresses when gifts to an overseas charity -- or travel and entertainment provided to foreign officials who may be considering issuing a contract to a business -- amount to a bribe.
For example, the guidance says that it would not violate the statute if a company provided foreign officials, like employees of a state-owned electricity commission, promotional T-shirts at a trade show, picked up a bar bill or bought ''a moderately priced crystal vase'' as a wedding gift. There would also be no violation if the company paid for the foreign visitors' travel to a city in the United States where it has facilities, including taking them to a baseball game or the theater.
However, the guide says, paying for foreign officials and their spouses to travel to a city like Las Vegas or Paris if the company has no significant facilities there would violate the law. That would display a ''corrupt intent'' to curry favor with the officials because ''the trip does not appear to be designed for any legitimate business purpose.''
''The fight against corruption is a law enforcement priority of the United States,'' Mr. Breuer said in a statement. Enforcement of the statute ''is critical to protecting the integrity of markets for American companies doing business abroad, and we will continue to make clear that bribing foreign officials is not an acceptable shortcut.''
Mr. Khuzami added: ''Investors must have faith that the economic performance of public companies reflects lawful considerations of markets, price and product rather than a mirage resulting from bribery and corruption.''
Paul E. Pelletier, a former Justice Department prosecutor who worked on Foreign Corrupt Practices Act investigations, said that in terms of ''providing bright lines that don't already exist,'' the guidance was unlikely to be ''groundbreaking'' for lawyers who already specialize in the law, but would be ''important and useful'' for in-house lawyers at companies.
''I think it's important because people want it and it provides one-stop shopping,'' he said. ''It's going to give us good boundaries as to what the government's present view is as to certain issues, and that's always good and helpful. And it's going to raise the profile of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act even more.''
Congress passed the act as part of a series of reforms after the Watergate scandal. For its first few decades, prosecutors rarely invoked the statute. But in recent years, enforcement has soared to 48 actions in 2010, from just two in 2004.
The change dates to the collapse of Enron a decade ago. It led to tougher financial laws, like requiring top executives at publicly traded companies to certify that their firms' books were accurate, which in turn forced them to pay closer attention to payments made overseas. The 2010 Dodd-Frank law further heightened pressure by giving corporate whistle-blowers a financial incentive to report violations.
Against that backdrop, beginning with the Justice Department in the George W. Bush administration, prosecutors began developing more expansive theories about the type of graft that the statute covered. The department and the S.E.C. also began increasing fines by requiring companies to disgorge profits as a condition of settling cases without an indictment. That drove up fines to record levels, including $800 million paid by Siemens in 2008.
Businesses have called for greater clarity, complaining that the law is being stretched beyond its intent and that it is not clear what conduct is now considered off limits; the guidance is expected to be closely analyzed by corporate lawyers who help firms comply with the law and respond when a violation is uncovered.
One of the business groups that has criticized how the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act has been enforced is the Chamber of Commerce's Institute for Legal Reform. Its president, Lisa A. Rickard, on Wednesday, praised the guidance as ''an important step forward in an ongoing process of providing much-needed clarity and certainty to the business community,'' and cited with approval several ''areas of concern'' the guidance addressed.
''While guidance by definition can never provide the same certainty as an affirmative statute, we're hopeful that this document will help companies seeking to comply with the law in good faith and prosecutors charged with enforcing it,'' she said in a statement.

HEADLINE: Hurricane Sandy Hindered Auto Sales

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Retail sales in the United States fell in October for the first time in three months as Hurricane Sandy slowed automobile purchases and suggested that spending early in the fourth quarter had lost some momentum. 
Other data on Wednesday showed wholesale prices falling last month for the first time since May, giving the Federal Reserve latitude to maintain its monetary policy.
Retail sales dipped 0.3 percent after a 1.3 percent increase in September, the Commerce Department said. Economists had expected sales to fall 0.2 percent.
''Sandy was a drag, but I expect we will see a gain in sales in November,'' said Augustine Faucher, a senior economist at the PNC Financial Services Group in Pittsburgh.
Part of the drop in sales could be a sign of hesitation among consumers facing the prospect of higher taxes next year if Congress cannot resolve the standoff on automatic tax increases and government spending cuts.
The tax increases and spending cuts may siphon about $600 billion from the economy next year if Congress fails to act to avert them. The fiscal uncertainty has already eroded business confidence.
''It's imperative that policy makers address the looming fiscal cliff now to give consumers some certainty heading into the holiday shopping season,'' said Matthew Shay, president of the National Retail Federation.
Carmakers blamed Sandy, the huge storm that lashed the densely populated East Coast and caused up to $50 billion in damage, for the abrupt halt in sales last month.
Automakers said traffic at East Coast dealerships slowed as residents began to brace for the storm, which hit at the end of the month. Sales tend to build up late in the month, which probably amplified the impact.
The Ford Motor Corporation estimated the industry lost sales of 20,000 to 25,000 vehicles, while Toyota put the loss at 30,000.
The Commerce Department said it had received indications from companies that the storm had both positive and negative effects on retail sales over all, but was unable to quantify them.
The storm probably slowed sales at clothing stores; it probably raised receipts at food and beverage stores. Economists expect the storm could shave as much as half a percentage point from economic growth in the fourth quarter. Any lost activity, however, could be made up early next year.
''That will come back in the first quarter. Spending on rebuilding will filter into growth numbers gradually over a number of quarters,'' said Julia Coronado, chief North America economist at BNP Paribas in New York.
Separately, the Labor Department said its producer price index slipped 0.2 percent last month, the first decline since May. The index had increased 1.1 percent in September.
Economists had expected the index, which details prices received by farms, factories and refineries, to increase 0.2 percent last month. Excluding volatile food and energy costs, wholesale prices also fell 0.2 percent.

HEADLINE: Fed Minutes Show Interest in Extending Bond-Buying Effort

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Reserve signaled in the records of its last policy meeting that it would probably announce a new bond-buying program in December to try to spur job growth, the documents showed on Wednesday. 
The purchases would be intended to reduce long-term borrowing rates to encourage spending and strengthen the economy. The expectation is that more hiring would follow.
Minutes of the Fed's Oct. 23-24 policy meeting, released on Wednesday, suggested that it would unveil a Treasury-buying plan to replace a program that expires at the end of the year. Under that program, Operation Twist, the Fed has been selling $45 billion a month in short-term Treasury bonds and using the proceeds to buy an equal amount of longer-term securities.
When Operation Twist ends, the Fed will run out of short-term investments to sell. The minutes showed support among Fed policy makers to replace Twist with another program of long-term bond purchases.
At their October policy meeting, Fed officials took no new action. They decided to wait to see whether the aggressive steps they announced in September would lift the economy.
In September, the Fed began buying the mortgage bonds to try to reduce long-term rates and make homes more affordable. It was the Fed's third round of bond-buying. The Fed said in September that it planned to keep its benchmark short-term rate near zero through mid-2015. It signaled it might take other steps if hiring did not increase.
It reaffirmed that stance in October. And in a statement after its meeting, it said that while the economy was improving moderately, job growth remained slow and the unemployment rate elevated. The rate is 7.9 percent.
Many analysts say the economy is growing in the current October-December quarter at an annual rate of less than 2 percent -- too slow to reduce unemployment. In part, that is why many economists predict the Fed will take further action at its last policy meeting of the year Dec. 11-12.
Operation Twist has not expanded the Fed's bond portfolio but has reconfigured the length of the maturities. A new Fed program would expand the portfolio.

HEADLINE: Terrorist Attack on Power Grid Could Cause Broad Hardship, Report Says

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Terrorists could black out large segments of the United States for weeks or months by attacking the power grid and damaging hard-to-replace components that are crucial to making it work, the National Academy of Sciences said in a report released Wednesday.
By blowing up substations or transmission lines with explosives or by firing projectiles at them from a distance, the report said, terrorists could cause cascading failures and damage parts that would take months to repair or replace. In the meantime, it warned, people could die from the cold or the excessive heat, and the economy could suffer hundreds of billions of dollars in damage. 
While the report is the most authoritative yet on the subject, the grid's vulnerability has long been obvious to independent engineers and to the electric industry itself, which has intermittently tried, in collaboration with the Department of Homeland Security, to rehearse responses.
Of particular concern are giant custom-built transformers that increase the voltage of electricity to levels suited for bulk transmission and then reduce voltage for distribution to customers. Very few of those transformers are manufactured in the United States, and replacing them can take many months.
In a preparedness drill in March, technicians shipped three specially designed transformers from St. Louis to Houston and rapidly installed them in a marathon effort. The transformers were the electrical equivalent of a Swiss Army knife, with multiple attachments so that they can be used in a variety of jobs.
They are functioning well, said one of the experiment's supervisors, Richard J. Lordan, a senior technical expert at the Electric Power Research Institute, a nonprofit consortium based in Palo Alto, Calif. But follow-up steps -- like figuring out how many such transformers should be stockpiled as well as developing storage depots, financing purchases of the equipment and planning how to allocate it in an emergency -- have yet to be taken.
Changes in the electric industry have made the grid more vulnerable in recent years, experts say. The grid was mostly built to serve the needs of individual utilities, but regulators have cut the generation companies loose from the companies that transport and distribute power to foster a competitive market. That has resulted in far more electricity being shipped much greater distances and in difficulty winning consensus to build new lines. Meanwhile, the Sept. 11 attacks and weather catastrophes like Hurricane Sandy have underlined the need for ever more vigilant monitoring and technological improvements.
''I don't think we pay quite enough attention to the technology fixes that would allow us to make the power system more resilient,'' said Clark W. Gellings, a researcher at the Electric Power Research Institute who is one of the report's authors.
For example, the report broaches the development of submersible electric switches that could be operated after a hurricane. Some of the other technologies that have been suggested, like more sensors to help operators determine the status of transformers and transmission lines, would also help the grid on an average summer day.
The report urges that cheaper ways be found to put power lines underground, which would protect them from some effects of storms, and also calls for changes in infrastructure that would reduce the kind of mutual dependencies that result in wider blackouts. For example, more traffic lights could run on high-efficiency L.E.D. lamps and be equipped with batteries, and small generators could be placed in spots where power is needed for pumping water. The natural gas system could be equipped with pumps that run on natural gas instead of electricity so that the system would survive an extended blackout.
The notion of a looming attack on the grid has recently gained a conservative political following, with Newt Gingrich, who sought the 2012 Republican presidential nomination, championing a novel that imagines the crippling of the nation and the starvation of millions by unidentified enemies using high-tech methods to fry components of the grid with an electromagnetic pulse. The report does not discuss that possibility, but the appendix does include ''electromagnetic pulse'' among other technical terms.
The National Academy of Sciences report mainly refers to less sophisticated attacks but also warns of cyberattacks or infiltration of the grid's transmission operators. ''Even a few pernicious people in the wrong place are a potential source of vulnerability,'' it said.
The report was completed in 2007, and after reviewing it, the Department of Homeland Security decided to classify its contents. The version released on Wednesday is redacted to avoid handing terrorists a ''cookbook'' on how to disrupt the grid, the report said.
Mr. Gellings, the researcher, said that despite the delay, most of the points it makes are still valid, although a chapter on cyberattacks is out of date.

HEADLINE: A Rare Moment for Myanmar-And America

BYLINE: By BILL RICHARDSON and MICKEY BERGMAN

 BODY:
THE lobby of the Traders Hotel in Yangon is buzzing in the early evening hours. The number of Chinese, Japanese, Europeans and Americans roaming the lobby is surprising. It's as if they are all here just waiting for the economic boom to happen.
In response to the political and economic reforms undertaken by the government of Myanmar, major U.S. sanctions have been suspended, albeit not removed. The opposition leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi has made a triumphant tour of the United States. President Thein Sein, the military ruler credited with ushering in the new reforms, was also appropriately welcomed. 
Having lived under house arrest off and on since 1989, the comparisons of Aung San Suu Kyi to Nelson Mandela are fitting. But Mandela needed his F.W. de Klerk, the South African political leader willing to push reform, however grudgingly, from within. People of courage and conscience are fighting injustice all over the world, but it is a rare moment in history when their desires overlap with the ruling regime.
After meeting with an array of leaders in Myanmar, we believe that Thein Sein is committed to transitioning to democracy. But the jury is still out on whether the reform effort will succeed. This is not a revolution like we've seen in Middle East countries during the last two years. This is a calculated and contained process -- a reform movement from within. On the one hand, it has to be slow and deliberate to allow for governing capacity to be built, as well as to prevent those who prefer the status quo from blocking change, and to keep oligarchs from seizing control and plundering Myanmar's abundant natural resources. On the other hand, it does need to move quickly so that the population will feel the benefits of reform. Success will rely heavily on full engagement and investment from abroad.
If the population does not feel the benefits of democracy and reform, chances are the process will fail.
Aung San Suu Kyi herself candidly admits that progress is not inevitable and that many challenges still remain.
First, the vast majority of people are very poor. Lifting their livelihood is in the interests of everyone involved -- the government, now that it will be directly elected, opposition parties, including Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy, and the business community, which is excited by this potential market. Yet creating jobs and growing the economy will require tremendous efforts by all elements of Burmese society and by the international community.
As Aung San Suu Kyi said, people-friendly investments like small-scale farming and labor-intensive businesses are of highest priority. Myanmar needs basic investments in water wells and electricity. Moreover, peaceful resolutions to the conflicts in the border areas are essential -- unless the country's minorities feel they are included, the reform movement will be undercut.
Second, the government lacks basic capacity and knowledge on how to govern properly. Following decades of dictatorship, members of the executive, legislative and judicial branches have limited ability to provide adequate services to their constituents. The good news is that they are eager to learn the standards and procedures of good governance. These include very basic skills such as drafting laws and budgets, constituent outreach, and how to work across party lines and deal with the business community. Basic elements of a functioning government are lacking. Members of Parliament, for instance, do not even have a staff.
American organizations specializing in democracy-building, until now focused mainly on feasibility studies, should be in full operation mode. Urgency in training is needed for both the legislative, executive and judicial branches, as well as the organization of political parties.
Third, the United States does not assign strategic importance to Myanmar. The result is a lack of urgency in using the tools available to make the reform process successful. Though sanctions have been formally suspended, in practice many remain in effect. Myanmar can really use an Enterprise Fund similar to the one being started by the State Department in Egypt and Tunisia. This can assist the Burmese in adopting U.S. business standards, as well as encourage American private-sector investments.
In America's absence, the Chinese will outflank U.S. interests. This could result in the loss of both economic opportunities and influence on progress toward liberalization and democracy.
This is a unique moment in Myanmar. Long-time rivals, while differing in their political views, share the intention of giving the process of liberalization and democracy the best possible chance. Those who have been imprisoned are willing to trust and collaborate with those who put them in captivity for the sake of peace, stability and progress. We should listen to them and fully embrace their efforts with a great sense of urgency.
There is much to be said about America's ability to demonstrate to other countries currently under U.S. sanctions, such as North Korea, what the benefits of reform and collaboration can look like. We can make Myanmar the positive case.

HEADLINE: My Lagos: Duro Olowu's Home Town

BYLINE: By SUZY MENKES

 BODY:
LAGOS -- Duro Olowu has a right to describe himself as a multicultural fashion designer.
Born of a Jamaican mother and a Nigerian father, he was raised in Lagos, where he can still point out the crumbling colonial and modernist buildings that were the homes of his primary school and his family doctor. He has a world view.
In London, where he was named New Designer of the Year in 2005 at the British Fashion Awards, he works out of a studio in Portobello Road, a vintage hub, and a store tucked away in Mason's Yard, St. James's. 
In New York, where he shows during the semiannual fashion weeks, he lives with his wife, Thelma Golden, director of the Studio Museum in Harlem.
The patterns and colors of his designs, which are sold around the world to concept stores like Ikram in Chicago and Biffi in Milan, seem intrinsically African. Yet Mr. Oluwu's fabrics are often British-made prints of his own design. Or they are Italian, French or Swiss fabrics that reflect, in an eclectic, offbeat way, both his African heritage and an international sensibility.
During one of his many trips ''home,'' he described ''My Lagos.''
Q. What does Lagos mean to you?
A. I visit Lagos many times a year, and I am totally recharged when I see how most people here make a lot out of very little. And it's really the old Lagos that I love; it's such a hub of activity and creativity: those stalls in Tinubu market selling second-hand clothes imported from Europe and the little streets behind the mosque with traders selling fabrics, shoes and household utensils.
Look at the way people put things together without thinking! Look at this embellished velvet! A whole collection could be inspired by just this mix of material.
Over there is our family church where we went every Sunday with my parents. And we came here to Kakawa Street for our traditional embroidered Yoruba hats from my father's hat maker.
My Jamaican mother used to find the tailors who carried sewing machines on their shoulders and get them to make patchwork shirts and furnishings from local fabrics mixed with others she picked up on holidays abroad. She was a big influence on how I see color and print.
Q. Prints are so fashionable right now -- and you are in the master class. How can you make pattern modern?
A. It's not a trend. It's an art -- an unexpected mix based on the fact that prints can come from such diverse places. I slice them into panels and mix them and see where they go. I never make things too obvious. They should be easy on the eye.
Q. Is it right that the middle class is growing in Lagos and that it is changing the face of shopping? At The Palms Shopping Center, on Victoria Island, I found sports brands like Converse, Levi's and Nike, as well as Swatch and a big new Woolworths. What about designer shops, luxury flagships or concept stores?
A. In Nigeria, economically, things have been tough over the last 25 years. If you can eat three times a day you are as good as rich. But there is a young, energetic almost-middle class looking for interesting things -- like mixing in vintage. Everyone wants to look different, and dressing well is a source of pride here.
Q. You have told me that local designers mostly sell by appointment from their studios. But there is a concept store that you took me to called Temple Muse. I was impressed by the sophisticated Baccarat and Lalique gift-giving area on the main floor, the hospitality of the owner Avinash Wadhwani, with his Champagne/coffee bar and cupcakes made by his mother. And his selection of mostly Nigerian fashion brands like Ituen Basi, Tiffany Amber, Sunny Rose and Jewel by Lisa (plus some cool Givenchy). This stylish 5,000-square-foot store seems unique. Are any more likely to pop up soon?
A. Reni Folawiyo, who is a visionary interior designer and entrepreneur, is building a concept store, Alara, designed by David Adjaye [the Ghanaian/British architect]. I am super-excited by what I believe will be the most inspiring retail building in Nigeria -- maybe even in West Africa. It is planned to open towards the end of 2013. It will stock carefully curated local luxury and lifestyle brands as well as showcasing talented designers and artisans from all over Africa.
Q. I have talked to Reni and she says she wants to create a space that the city will be proud of -- using her furniture factory to introduce work from West Africa, like natural cotton and raffia from Dakar, Senegal and Uganda. It's about encouraging an interest in craftsmanship and the things people in the small villages used to make with their hands.
A. It's also planned to be a hub for artists, which is I believe is something that interests you.
The contemporary art scene has just exploded in this city in the last few years. I am interested in the Lagos Photo Festival started by Azu Nwagbogu. This year photographers were selected for work inspired by their visions of the city.
Q. What about the art of eating? I liked that Terra Kulture center, with a restaurant, art gallery, language school and bookstore.
A. I eat mostly at restaurants serving local cuisine. For evenings I love the ambience at the Bogobiri House, which is a boutique hotel and restaurant with live music [on Maitama Sule Street in Ikoyi].
Q. Would you think of opening a store in your hometown?
A. Absolutely! And I have been offered a concession space at the Alara concept store. There is an eager local market as well as those who visit from the whole continent of Africa.
I am also looking at spaces in New York. My own label price points are high -- from 800 upwards. So I am excited about a one-off collaboration with the American chain J.C. Penney. My women's wear, accessories and home line is out in March 2013 and the most expensive thing is $100.
That is something that Lagos would love!

HEADLINE: Maiyet Embraces the Human Touch

BYLINE: By SUZY MENKES

 BODY:
NEW YORK -- ''Why do the French and Italians get to have a monopoly of luxury? They are amazing and they've blazed the trail, but there is a new generation of artisans who is just as good and could step up alongside them,'' says Paul van Zyl, the co-founder of Maiyet, whose rare and exceptional offerings are created by artisans around the world.
There might be a horn bird necklace, part of which was carved in Kenya and part in Vietnam; handmade buttons from Colombia; a jumpsuit patterned with frogs from India; or a silk batik halter dress from Indonesia. Even Italy gets a place in the label's summer 2013 collection, its craftspeople creating wedge shoes or a clutch bag. 
The result, when the Maiyet brand showed during Paris Fashion Week in October, was a streamlined and sophisticated collection a giant leap away from the ethnic trail.
Mr. van Zyl, a former human rights lawyer from South Africa, spells out the goal of the company he established a little over a year ago with Kirsty Caylor, co-founder and now president of Maiyet. He says the aim of the duo, who are based in New York, is ''to create a fashion brand and pioneer new luxury by celebrating rare skills from unexpected places.''
Behind the collection of clothes and accessories in the New York hub is a team dedicated to tapping, for example, the historic knitwear culture of Machu Picchu in Peru.
The project requires ''a very attuned sense of local culture, local ability and local skills,'' Mr. van Zyl says. But, he explains, ''we don't source products; we source skills which we then leverage into products.''
And however astounding, inspiring and beautiful the craftsmanship, he adds, Maiyet is not only about celebrating the skills of the artisans and offering them a sales platform.
The larger idea is that by helping the local economy, it should be possible to introduce stability and thus lessen ethnic conflict and human rights abuses. In practical terms, Maiyet's projects also strive to provide tangible help by establishing a modern work area with climate control and the ability to withstand severe weather like many countries experience during monsoon seasons.
''We're helping them, not patronizing them,'' Mr. van Zyl said of the workers, noting that ''people buy because the product is gorgeous, compelling and beautiful. It represents a new and interesting aesthetic and we are pioneering a new way of doing luxury.''
For Ms. Caylor, emotion has been a factor since she first explored the artisan concept at a project in Guatemala.
''It was a hands-on experience that stayed with me,'' she says. ''I believe in the spirit behind it, the nuance. I equate it to when I see drawing or painting perfectly rendered and there is something different produced by hand than if done digitally.''
Ms. Caylor has found that the emotional can turn into the practical.
''There is a wonderful anecdote about workers in Varanasi in India -- a place that is a religious mecca of Buddhist belief, with Hindu people going there to trade,'' she says, explaining how Maiyet obtained ''new patterns, colors and textures'' and helped some of the 95,000 local weavers get back into work.
''We first sourced 50 meters from them and now in the fourth season, it is close to 1,000,'' or nearly 3,300 feet of cloth, adds Mr. Van Zyl. ''They are making beautiful stuff.''
These modern clothes and accessories with a human touch are such a success that Maiyet will open its own store on Crosby Street in downtown New York City in March.
''We are finding an interesting set of people who want something new at Barneys, at Net-A-Porter and at London's Selfridges,'' says Ms. Caylor, whose background was in brand management, working at the U.S. companies Gap and Band of Outsiders.
The brand has a broad price range, with clothing that ranges from $450 to $2,150; shoes and handbags from $595 to $4,800; and jewelry from $400 to $49,000.
At Barneys New York, where customers have battled to grab the last hand-made Maiyet necklace from a mannequin, there is a thoughtful clientele that appreciates and understands this kind of luxury, says Daniella Vitale, the store's chief operating officer and lead merchandising executive.
''People respond first and foremost to a beautiful product, and it comes with a civic aspect and a strong message of social responsibility,'' says Ms. Vitale, who has arranged store seminars so clients can understand how the Maiyet team works with individual producers, establishing training to help ensure efficient and sustainable production.
''Paul is so articulate and they are so passionate about their brand and what they do -- you feel like you are a part of it,'' says Ms. Vitale, who has also seen the duo explaining to the sales staff the products and their appeal.
Maiyet, named for the Egyptian goddess of truth and harmony, was built with the support of Daniel Lubetzky, a social entrepreneur with a mission to make social and sustainable initiatives into efficient businesses.
Mr. van Zyl says that the company is on target and that it is ''meeting all of our financial predictions,'' helped by ''a wonderful sell-through at Barneys.''
Ms. Caylor says simply that she spends a lot of time on airplanes but ''all in coach because we are a start-up.''
On those many travels, Ms. Caylor gets to the heart of the project. ''I am blown away by craftsmanship and artisanship. It is astounding, inspiring and beautiful,'' she says. ''Maiyet is a celebration of what these people are capable of doing.''

HEADLINE: Saving Up for a Dry Day

BYLINE: By KATE GALBRAITH

 BODY:
AUSTIN, TEXAS -- Last year, as a ferocious drought tightened its hold on Texas, John Kight, a landowner in the Hill Country west of here, was getting calls. Eleven years ago, Mr. Kight installed a rainwater harvesting system at his rural home, and as wells started to go dry around the state in 2011, other Texans wanted tips for collecting and storing water from the sky.
''A good rain is just like a deposit to a bank,'' said Mr. Kight, who gives talks on rainwater harvesting around Texas and is also an official at his local water authority, the Cow Creek Groundwater Conservation District. ''It works exactly the same way.'' 
Collecting rainwater is an ancient idea, done in places like India and Rome before people could rely wholly on centralized piping systems. These days, the concept is returning to advanced economies, especially in drought-stricken areas. Germany is a leader in rainwater harvesting, with more than 1.5 million systems in homes and businesses, according to Dietmar Sperfeld, an official at the Association for Rainwater Harvesting and Water Utilization in Germany. Britain has about 100,000 systems, with 5,000 being added each year, according to estimates by Terry Nash, director of the U.K. Rainwater Harvesting Association.
The concept is fairly simple. Large tanks store captured rainwater that has been filtered. The water is piped to the garden and sometimes into the home for nondrinking uses, like flushing toilets. Further treatment is required to make the water safely drinkable, so most homes with rainwater systems also rely on the local water supply or wells.
Because separate pipes are needed to keep rainwater out of the tap, it is more cost-effective to install the systems when a home is being built, as opposed to retrofitting an existing home, according to Mr. Nash. He puts the average price of a system at about 2,000, or $3,175, for a new home, including installation costs. Mr. Sperfeld, of the German rainwater group, puts the price at &#x20ac;4,000 to &#x20ac;6,000, or about $5,000 to $7,500, for a rainwater system that includes water for flushing toilets and running washing machines. Many German companies manufacture rainwater harvesting equipment, he said.
The increasing interest in rainwater harvesting stems from rising water bills, drought and environmental awareness. The idea of creating one's own water supply can also be liberating.
''The rainwater way is the way you can control your own destiny,'' said Mr. Kight, the Texan.
But the systems are not for everyone. The first barrier is the high upfront cost. Incentives offered by German states to make installation less expensive have largely ended, Mr. Sperfeld said, with only Bremen and a scattering of local communities still helping businesses or homeowners with costs.
Other obstacles include a lack of space for storage tanks. This, of course, is most relevant to cities, where homes are densely packed. The systems also require regular maintenance, like cleaning the filters.
And things can go wrong. David Butler, director of the Center for Water Systems at the University of Exeter in England, said that in one building his group monitored, the rainwater harvesting system had failed over the course of a few months. The problem turned out to be easy to fix, but ''nobody noticed (except us) because the backup system kicked in,'' he said in an e-mail. ''So, these systems are not fit-and-forget.''
As a broad solution to the world's water challenges, rainwater harvesting makes little sense, according to John Briscoe, a professor of environmental engineering and environmental health practices at Harvard University in Massachusetts, who has decades of experience with water issues worldwide. In the developing world, the most pressing water needs center on providing more infrastructure and ensuring that administrative institutions function better, he said.
Rainwater harvesting ''was something that made a lot of sense in India in a different time and a different place,'' Mr. Briscoe said. But these days, when it comes to meeting the world's water needs, ''at very best it's part of a much more complex portfolio.''
Perhaps their greatest vulnerability is that rainwater harvesting systems need rain.
''Some argue that rainwater harvesting is needed most during long, dry periods, which is exactly the time when they are likely to be empty.'' said Mr. Butler of the University of Exeter. ''This boils down to careful design.''
Mr. Kight, who lives so far out in the country that his system includes ultraviolet disinfection to allow him to drink the rainwater, said that he got through the recent drought with his 41,000-gallon, or 155,000-liter, storage system still half-full. He argues that rainwater harvesting goes hand in hand with a sustainable approach to water. He does not run sprinklers on the grass, and his appliances are all low-flow.
Having a rainwater harvesting system ''makes you become a good resource manager,'' Mr. Kight said.

HEADLINE: Protests Over Gas Prices in Jordan Turn Deadly

BYLINE: By JODI RUDOREN and RANYA KADRI

 BODY:
AMMAN, Jordan -- A young man was killed and a dozen police officers were injured Wednesday night in the northern city of Irbid as demonstrations over increased gas prices stretched into a second day and opposition leaders scrambled to harness a spontaneous eruption of anger that spread throughout the kingdom, taking officials and opposition leaders by surprise.
The demonstrations were the most aggressive in this politically fragile and strategically critical ally of the United States in the past two years, particularly outside the capital, where many protesters shouted slogans against King Abdullah II that previously would only have been whispered. Teachers went on strike, and other unions announced a two-hour work stoppage for Sunday. The crowds included first-time protesters and tribal members who have been the king's political base. 
''This is the beginning of the Jordanian Spring, Nov. 13,'' declared Hassan Barari, a political science professor at the University of Jordan, where students blocked a main road near campus. ''Because this is no longer a political thing; this is the lives of the people. If you go around to the tribes, this is the backbone of the king, they can't afford anything. It can't be worse.''
Analysts and activists said the outpouring since the reduction of gas subsidies on Tuesday was an important shift in the criticism of the leadership in recent months because many of the protesters were not affiliated with political parties, unions or the secular opposition movement.
''It's popular and spontaneous; it was not called by activists and Islamists,'' said Kamal Khoury, an activist and blogger. ''It was regular people going crazy about what's going on.''
Violence was most severe in Irbid, where the authorities said a police station was attacked by armed demonstrators, leading to the fatal shooting of Qasi Omari, 22, and injuries to a dozen police officers and four protesters. A police corporal was also injured when someone fired an automatic pistol from a moving car, the police said in a statement.
In Madaba, an ancient city that draws tourists to its holy sites, protesters tore down the king's picture and burned it, according to an activist who was there, then smashed windows of several banks, pulling the furniture from one and setting it aflame. Witnesses reported the looting of a discount store for government employees in Salt, and the riot police in Tafileh firing bullets into the air. In Karak, a southern city known for its staunch support of the monarchy, protesters burned the house of the governor. ''He's representing the king, and our problem is with the king today,'' explained Basel Beshapsheh, a longtime leader of antigovernment activities.
In Amman, dozens of officers in helmets and body armor blocked access to Dakhliyeh Circle, a popular sit-in site, so hundreds crowded in front of their line, chanting things like ''The people know who is the corrupt guy.'' The demonstration began peacefully, but after a few hours protesters threw rocks and burned tires, and officers responded with tear gas.
Sana Ghaith, an artist who said she earned about $211 per month, was a first-time protester who joined the Dakhliyeh gathering. ''I can't afford the living conditions,'' she said to explain why she showed up. ''I don't want anything to happen in the country, but I want them to fix the prices. I'm divided. I'm angry, and I'm scared for the country.''
The catalyst for the outburst was the announcement on Tuesday that, facing a deficit of more than $3 billion, the government would reduce fuel subsidies, effectively increasing the price of gasoline for cars to $1.13 per liter from 99 cents, and of gas for cooking to $14.10 from $9.17.
Jaafar Hassan, Jordan's planning minister, said in an interview on Wednesday night that the change was necessary because fuel costs had quintupled in the past two years, consuming 18 percent of the nation's gross domestic product. He pointed out that unlike a price increase announced in September and withdrawn after a day of demonstrations, this one was coupled with a compensation package that would provide three-quarters of Jordanian households with $100 per person per year -- something apparently lost on the protesters.
''We have to do the utmost to live up to the expectations,'' Mr. Hassan said, ''and don't forget the expectations are very high here in the region. How do you meet the increasing expectations with the rising costs and the economic situation? That's the challenge that we are facing.''
The foreign minister, Nasser Judeh, said the government had tried to respond to the opposition over the past year with the establishment of an independent elections commission before balloting set for January and the formation of a constitutional court, among other changes. ''The political reform process, the social reform process, is on track, and the economic reform process has to be on track,'' he said.
Protesters blame corruption for the economic problems, not the reduction in financial aid from Persian Gulf states or the shortage of cheap gas from Egypt. Leaders of the opposition movement said Wednesday night that they had to intervene to stop the first-time protesters from violence, after spending much of the day in strategy sessions on how to leverage the new energy in their movement.
''Our role has become to calm people down,'' said Mr. Beshapsheh, the activist in Karak.
Mohammed Hussein, 29, a teacher at the Amman protest, said he was worried by the ''new faces'' because ''these are the ones who will be a danger to the public property.''
In Tafileh, Saed Oran, the head of the local teachers' union, said the protests on Wednesday drew many he had never seen before.
''The danger point is that these people, they don't understand what demonstrations are about and how to behave in a demonstration,'' Mr. Oran said. ''They now are a turning point in the movement and the demonstrations, and they are a critical turning point. You cannot control them because they don't have anyone responsible for them or anyone driving them.''

HEADLINE: Shares Fall After Obama's Tax Remarks

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Investors drew little hope Wednesday for a quick compromise in budget talks after President Obama insisted that higher taxes on wealthy Americans would have to be part of any deal.
Stocks fell sharply, and even a signal from the Federal Reserve that it could introduce a program in December to speed job growth failed to encourage investors. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 185.23 points, or 1.45 percent, to 12,570.95. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 19.04 points, or 1.39 percent, to 1,355.49, and the Nasdaq composite index declined 37.08 points, or 1.29 percent, to 2,846.81.
Mr. Obama reiterated in a news conference Wednesday that he would seek higher tax revenue from the wealthiest Americans, which faces opposition among some Republicans in Congress. The president said that a modest increase on the wealthy ''is not going to break their backs.'' 
The budget talks are centered on tax increases and government spending cuts that will take effect Jan. 1 unless Mr. Obama and Congress reach a deal first. They would total about $700 billion for 2013 and could send the country back into recession.
''The Street was looking for him to say some magic buzzwords about avoiding the 'fiscal cliff,' about cooperation,'' said Sal Arnuk of Themis Trading, a brokerage firm in Chatham, N.J. Instead, Mr. Arnuk said, the remarks were ''unyielding.''
Stocks have fallen steadily since voters returned Mr. Obama and a divided Congress to power Nov. 6. The Dow has fallen 675 points, or 5.1 percent, including three daily drops of more than 100 points.
''Investors' hopes that the election would end uncertainty remain unfulfilled,'' said Lawrence R. Creatura, a portfolio manager at Federated Investors in Rochester. ''It's very tough to determine what happens next.''
Despite the recent slide, indexes are still up this year, though they have pared gains since reaching four-year highs. The S.& P. has fallen 7.5 percent since its Sept. 14 peak, and the Dow has fallen 7.6 percent, more than 1,000 points, since its Oct. 5 peak.
The Commerce Department said that Americans cut back on spending in October, suggesting that many are still cautious about the economy.
Retail sales dropped 0.3 percent last month after three months of gains. That was worse than analysts had been expecting, according to FactSet, a provider of financial data.
The government also said auto sales fell 1.5 percent, the most in more than a year, partly because of the effects of Hurricane Sandy.
The Fed released minutes of its October meeting and suggested that it may replace a soon-to-end program of buying United States government bonds, known as Operation Twist, with another program of long-term bond purchases in December.
The purchases are intended to lower long-term borrowing rates to encourage spending and strengthen the economy. The hope is that more hiring would follow.
The Treasury's benchmark 10-year notes rose 2/32, to 100 11/32, while the yield was unchanged at 1.59 percent.
On the bright side Wednesday, Cisco Systems, the maker of computer networking equipment, gained 81 cents, or 4.81 percent, to $17.66. Cisco said late Tuesday that its earnings rose 18 percent in the latest quarter and that American companies were starting to spend again.
Advanced Micro Devices, a chip maker, slumped 16 cents, or 7.66 percent, to $1.93, after the company denied a report that said it was considering a sale.
Facebook jumped $2.50, or 12.59 percent, to $22.36. Wednesday was the expiration of a so-called lockup period that prevents insiders from selling stock immediately after a company goes public. About 850 million shares are being freed for sale.

HEADLINE: Marlins Validate Stadium Critics' Fear

BYLINE: By ANDREW KEH

 BODY:
Three years ago, officials of Miami and Miami-Dade County were persuaded to provide most of the money necessary to build a gleaming new stadium for the Miami Marlins. In turn, it was understood, the Marlins would financially commit themselves to fielding a competitive team for years to come.
There were dissenters -- not many, but loud ones -- like Carlos Gimenez, then a county commissioner, who was skeptical of the intentions of the team's owner, Jeffrey Loria, and opposed a deal that seemed much too generous, particularly during a recession. 
Those dissenters now look prescient. On Tuesday, the Marlins, who finished the past season in last place, completed a stunning fire sale that left their roster depleted and their payroll relatively tiny and had many in Miami, Gimenez included, shaking their heads that all this happened after one season in the new park.
''Many times, on the record, they made a commitment that once they had a stadium, they would have a competitive team,'' Gimenez said Wednesday of the Marlins' ownership. Instead, he said, ''the team seems to have indicated that they won't do that now or in the future.''
Gimenez, who became the mayor of Miami-Dade County last year, said he did not feel vindicated by the developments, but it appeared that he had been. The stadium deal left the city of Miami and the county to pay three-quarters of the reported $645 million price of the stadium and surrounding parking lots, the team alone would take any revenue produced through ticket and suite sales, concessions, advertising and any future naming rights.
This is not the first time Loria has dismantled the Marlins. In the seasons after their 2003 championship, the roster was similarly stripped down, although at that time, the Marlins could argue that they lacked a stadium of their own that would bring out more fans and generate more revenue. They shared a home with the N.F.L.'s Dolphins in Miami Gardens.
But now a baseball park is here, and nothing has changed. After aggressively stocking the team last off-season with high-priced free agents, the Marlins began to deal veterans away over the summer once it was clear the team would not have a good season. The decimation was completed Tuesday, when they agreed to send Jose Reyes, Josh Johnson, Mark Buehrle, John Buck and Emilio Bonifacio to the Toronto Blue Jays for shortstop Yunel Escobar and prospects.
The trade, which is not yet official, has raised eyebrows inside the players union. Just a few years ago the union raised questions as to whether the Marlins, with their markedly low payrolls, were violating the collective bargaining agreement by not using revenue-sharing money on player development and salaries.
That led the Marlins to agree to allow Major League Baseball and the union to monitor their finances through the 2012 season. But in 2013, the Marlins' payroll will most likely be extremely low and their chances of being competitive probably nonexistent.
''We've already had preliminary contact with the commissioner's office about this transaction,'' Michael Weiner, the director of the players union, said Wednesday. ''And we expect to continue that dialogue once all the details about the transaction are known. A transaction of this sort raises potential concern.''
On Wednesday, Loria was at a regularly scheduled meeting of baseball owners in Chicago and seemed defiant when asked about the trade. ''We finished in last place,'' Loria said, according to CBSSports.com. ''Figure it out.'' He denied having intentions of selling the team.
In fairness to the Marlins, the players they received from the Blue Jays have merit.
''It's not a bad haul,'' said Jim Callis, executive editor of Baseball America, who closely tracks prospects. ''But it wasn't a talent-for-talent trade, by any means. They were trying to get rid of salary, and they got some talent in return. If you're trying to win, you don't make that trade.''
However, as Gimenez sees it, the people of Miami will be worse off no matter what happens.
''Whether the Marlins make money, whether they don't, whether the team's a success or not, Miami-Dade County is stuck,'' he said. ''Whether they make $2 or $200 million, we pay what we pay.''

HEADLINE: Romney Attributes Obama Win to 'Gifts'

BYLINE: By ASHLEY PARKER; Jeff Zeleny contributed reporting from Las Vegas.

 BODY:
Saying that he and his team still felt "troubled" by his loss to President Obama, Mitt Romney on Wednesday attributed his defeat in part to what he called big policy "gifts" that the president had bestowed on loyal Democratic constituencies, including young voters, African-Americans and Hispanics.
In a conference call with fund-raisers and donors to his campaign, Mr. Romney said Wednesday afternoon that the president had followed the "old playbook" of using targeted initiatives to woo specific interest groups - "especially the African-American community, the Hispanic community and young people." 
"In each case, they were very generous in what they gave to those groups," Mr. Romney said, contrasting Mr. Obama's strategy to his own of "talking about big issues for the whole country: military strategy, foreign policy, a strong economy, creating jobs and so forth."
Mr. Romney's comments in the 20-minute conference call came after his running mate, Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, told WISC-TV in Madison on Monday that their loss was a result of Mr. Obama's strength in "urban areas," an analysis that did not account for Mr. Obama's victories in more rural states like Iowa and New Hampshire or the decrease in the number of votes for the president relative to 2008 in critical urban counties in Ohio.
"With regards to the young people, for instance, a forgiveness of college loan interest was a big gift," Mr. Romney said. "Free contraceptives were very big with young, college-aged women. And then, finally, Obamacare also made a difference for them, because as you know, anybody now 26 years of age and younger was now going to be part of their parents' plan, and that was a big gift to young people. They turned out in large numbers, a larger share in this election even than in 2008."
The president's health care plan, he said, was also a useful tool in mobilizing black and Hispanic voters. Though Mr. Romney won the white vote with 59 percent, according to exit polls, minorities coalesced around the president in overwhelming numbers: 93 percent of blacks and 71 percent of Hispanics.
"You can imagine for somebody making $25,000 or $30,000 or $35,000 a year, being told you're now going to get free health care, particularly if you don't have it, getting free health care worth, what, $10,000 per family, in perpetuity - I mean, this is huge," Mr. Romney said. "Likewise with Hispanic voters, free health care was a big plus. But in addition with regards to Hispanic voters, the amnesty for children of illegals, the so-called Dream Act kids, was a huge plus for that voting group."
Nationwide, Mr. Obama won a slightly smaller share of 18- to 29-year-old voters than he did in 2008, according to exit polls, though he increased his share in battleground states like Florida, Ohio and Virginia. Exit polls showed little appreciable difference between Mr. Obama's performance among black voters nationwide and in many swing states in this election and in 2008. Among Hispanic voters nationwide, Mr. Obama won a greater share in 2012 than in 2008, but perhaps more important, he succeeded in increasing the share of Hispanic voters among the total voting population in key states, including Colorado and Nevada, exit polls showed.
During the call, Mr. Romney was by turns disappointed and pragmatic, expressing his frustration at the outcome on Election Day. A person who was on the call, which included hundreds of participants, let The New York Times listen in.
"I'm very sorry that we didn't win," Mr. Romney said on the call. "I know that you expected to win, we expected to win, we were disappointed with the result, we hadn't anticipated it, and it was very close, but close doesn't count in this business."
He continued: "And so now we're looking and saying, 'O.K., what can we do going forward?' But frankly, we're still so troubled by the past, it's hard to put together our plans for the future."
He added that he was hoping to find a way for the close-knit group, which excelled in fund-raising but was ultimately unable to propel him into the Oval Office, "to stay connected so that we can stay informed and have influence on the direction of the party, and perhaps the selection of a future nominee, which, by the way, will not be me." (He suggested an annual meeting, as well as a monthly newsletter.)
In a news conference of his own Wednesday, Mr. Obama, asked if he still planned to meet with Mr. Romney for a postelection discussion, spoke positively of his former opponent, saying that he "did a terrific job of running the Olympics," and that he appreciated Mr. Romney's ideas on government efficiency.
"I'm not either prejudging what he's interested in doing, nor am I suggesting I've got some specific assignment," the president said, when asked about Mr. Romney. "But what I want to do is to get ideas from him and see if there are some ways that we can potentially work together."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Making Small Business a Cause

BYLINE: By ROBB MANDELBAUM

 BODY:
Carlene O'Garro's cake business was barely a month old when she arrived at the Samuel Adams brewery in South Boston recently to meet with business counselors, but she brought with her an agenda that hinted at outsize ambitions.
Ms. O'Garro bakes nondairy cheesecakes that she was selling at a handful of grocery stores, including two Whole Foods outlets, in the Boston area. She hoped to learn how to expand the business and distribute the cakes nationally. ''I know Jim is all over the place,'' she said, ''and I want to be like that.''
Jim is Jim Koch, the founder of the Boston Beer Company and one of 36 advisers who spent an evening last August ''speed coaching'' fledgling food, beverage and hospitality businesses. In 20-minute sessions, some 95 bakers, brewers and restaurant owners peppered the coaches -- Boston Beer employees and consultants who included lawyers, accountants and small-business counselors -- with questions about both basic day-to-day issues and more strategic concerns. 
Speed coaching is one element of ''Brewing the American Dream,'' a program Boston Beer established with a microlender, Accion, to help small businesses. Mr. Koch, who started brewing Samuel Adams Boston Lager at his house in 1984, remains central to these efforts even as he presides over a company with a market capitalization of $1.4 billion and annual revenue of more than $500 million. He said he had not forgotten his early days, when he struggled to find capital, get his beer into distribution networks and expand.
In six sessions that August evening, Mr. Koch spoke with perhaps a dozen entrepreneurs and then stayed another hour to visit with six or eight more. This year, Boston Beer and Accion are staging 12 speed-coaching events in 11 cities, and Mr. Koch expects to attend about half of them.
Big businesses reaching out to help smaller businesses has come into vogue since the recession. In 2009, Goldman Sachs introduced its 10,000 Small Businesses campaign. Starbucks raises money from customer donations to finance small-business loans. American Express encourages consumers to shop locally on ''Small Business Saturday'' after Thanksgiving. The New York Stock Exchange links small vendors with large corporations and finances loans through Accion. And several corporations have run contests -- Wal-Mart, Chase Bank and Staples have furnished winning small companies with opportunities for retail distribution, capital and office equipment.
It is the latest example of what is known in corporate circles as cause marketing -- hitching a brand to a social issue. ''How you improve the American economy and create jobs is on everybody's minds these days,'' said David Hessekiel, founder and president of Cause Marketing Forum. ''Companies know that it's on the minds of their consumers, and they want to be seen as part of the solution, not as the enemy.''
That has been a particular concern for chains like Wal-Mart and Starbucks, given their longstanding reputations for forcing local competitors to close. Helping small businesses, Mr. Hessekiel said, ''helps them deal with an old issue.''
But some critics of the big chains dismiss their chivalry as mostly cosmetic.
''The public relations value of being associated with small business is quite high,'' said Stacy Mitchell, a senior researcher at the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a nonprofit based in Minneapolis and Washington that promotes strong local economies. ''You've got companies that have very aggressive expansion strategies -- they're really squeezing out opportunities for small businesses. These programs do very little compared to the larger shifts in market share that these companies are driving. They're drops in the bucket.''
For its part, the Boston Beer program actually predates the recent economic crisis. The seeds of the idea, Mr. Koch said, came to him in 2007 as he walked to his car after he and his employees had volunteered to paint a nearby community center. ''I should have felt really good, and I didn't -- I felt a little depressed,'' he said. ''What I realized is, I'd just taken about $10,000 worth of management time and talent, and turned it into about $1,000 worth of painting. And it was pretty bad painting, too.''
Mr. Koch retooled his company's philanthropy to take advantage of its resources, particularly its employees' expertise. The company has committed $1.4 million to finance loans, which are handled by Accion. The loans are small, typically $5,000 to $7,000, with terms of 18 months to two years and interest rates that vary regionally. (In New England, the rate is around 13 percent, typical for microloans.)
Perhaps as important as the money is the tutoring by Mr. Koch and his employees. Most microloan programs provide borrowers with rudimentary counseling, but Boston Beer is unusually ''high touch,'' said Shaolee Sen, vice president for strategy and development at the Accion U.S. Network.
Ms. O'Garro was one of the program's original clients -- she has had two loans, totaling $4,000 -- and though she's repaid that debt and though the muffin business it helped finance has been dormant since 2010, she continues to derive benefits from the program with her cheesecake business, Delectable Desires. She learned how to price her cakes from an employee in Boston Beer's finance department, Mike Cramer, who went to Whole Foods and scoped out the competition. ''He actually made a spreadsheet for me of how much the high-end and low-end desserts cost,'' she said.
Another borrower, Sandy Russo of Lulu's Sweet Shoppe in Boston, said that when she had questions, she sometimes called Mr. Koch's executive assistant. Last summer, when Lulu's opened a second location, Boston Beer's lawyers reviewed the lease and its public relations staff wrote the news release.
Of course, it's one thing to provide that kind of support to a handful of companies. The question facing Accion and Boston Beer is whether the program can remain as intensive as it expands nationally. ''We're really struggling with that right now,'' Ms. Sen said. ''The portfolio has been so small up until this point that they really are passionate about their clients.''
As the loans grow and become more far-flung, Boston Beer and Accion will try to package that passion as Web content, Ms. Sen said, and steer some borrowers to webinars, live chats and ''recycled content,'' like recorded conversations with other borrowers. Next year, the partners will introduce an online community for borrowers with discussion boards and a new Craigslist-type service tentatively called Jim's List.
By the time Ms. O'Garro sat down with Mr. Koch at a table in one of the brewery's tasting rooms, she was filled with uncertainty. Earlier in the evening, a consultant, Carol Coutrier, had suggested that she consider marketing the cheesecakes to food service distributors that serve institutional kitchens at hospitals and schools. ''The supermarkets will kill you, absolutely kill you,'' with their various promotional requirements, she said. ''They'll bleed you dry.''
Then Ms. O'Garro mentioned her other product, an all-natural graham crumb for pie crusts, made with honey instead of high-fructose corn syrup. This, Ms. Coutrier said, was a more distinctive product and one that might go further than a nondairy cheesecake.
Mr. Koch, with a lager glass of his company's Whitewater IPA in front of him and a genial grin on his face, told Ms. O'Garro it was O.K. to have two products. ''The market,'' he said, ''will tell you which one they want.''
But Mr. Koch suggested that the graham crumbs' high production cost would keep sales down and make it harder for her to produce enough to justify hiring her first employees. At the moment, Ms. O'Garro does everything, from the baking to the selling, all while holding a 30-hour-a-week night job at United Parcel Service. If necessary, he said, she should cut her margins to increase volume. ''You've got to get to the point where you can leverage yourself,'' he said.
After the coaching, Ms. O'Garro settled on an all-of-the-above strategy. She cut the price on the graham crumbs in the hopes of selling more. She has also pushed to place her cakes in eight more Whole Foods. And she called one of the distributors Ms. Coutrier recommended, quickly winning an audition -- and an order.
In October, she baked 480 cheesecakes for cafeterias in the area. Her new distributor is negotiating to introduce Delectable Desires cakes to an upscale restaurant chain, and a handful of universities may follow.
By early 2013, she hopes to ring up monthly sales of at least $5,000 -- enough to hire her first part-time employee.

HEADLINE: Novel About Racial Injustice Wins National Book Award

BYLINE: By LESLIE KAUFMAN

 BODY:
Beating out an unusually competitive field, Louise Erdrich won the National Book Award for fiction on Wednesday night for ''The Round House,'' a novel about a teenage boy's effort to investigate an attack on his mother on a North Dakota reservation, and his struggle to come to terms with the violence in their culture.
Ms. Erdrich accepted the award in part in her Native American language. She said she wanted to acknowledge ''the grace and endurance of native women.'' 
She added: ''This is a book about a huge case of injustice ongoing on reservations. Thank you for giving it a wider audience.''
The book was published by Harper, an imprint of HarperCollins. Ms. Erdrich is the author of 14 novels, including ''Love Medicine,'' which was published in 1984.
The competition for the fiction prize was considered particularly tight this year. Unlike in recent years, when many little-known authors were nominated, the judges produced a high-profile slate of finalists, including the Pulitzer Prize winner Junot Daz, who was nominated for ''This Is How You Lose Her,'' and Dave Eggers, nominated for ''A Hologram for the King.''
The nonfiction category was every bit as competitive and featured established authors like the biographer Robert Caro and the late Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Anthony Shadid, who wrote for The Washington Post and The New York Times.
It was won by Katherine Boo for ''Behind the Beautiful Forevers: Life, Death, and Hope in a Mumbai Undercity.'' In her book, Ms. Boo tells of the heart-rending struggles of the dwellers of a slum in the shadow of luxury hotels in India.
''If this prize means anything,'' she said in her acceptance speech, ''it is that small stories in so-called hidden places matter because they implicate and complicate what we consider to be the larger story, which is the story of people who do have political and economic powers.''
Celebrating its 63rd year, the National Book Awards packed some 670 attendees into the elegant Cipriani on Wall Street. The logistics behind the award were particularly challenging this year, as storm surge from Hurricane Sandy flooded the office of the National Book Foundation, which presents the awards, and they have still not been reopened.
To be eligible for an award, a book must have been written by a United States citizen. Winners received $10,000 and a bronze statue.
The award for Young People's Literature went to William Alexander for ''Goblin Secrets,'' published by Margaret K. McElderry Books, an imprint of Simon & Schuster.
''The way things are, are not the only possible way they can be,'' Mr. Alexander said. ''Stories are the first way we figured that out.''
David Ferry choked up slightly as he accepted the poetry award for ''Bewilderment: New Poems and Translations,'' published by the University of Chicago Press. He said he had amazing rivals in his category, and his one advantage was being much older. ''My only hope was a preposterous pre-posthumous award,'' he said, ''and I guess that is what I have won here.''
Earlier in the evening, Arthur Sulzberger Jr., the publisher of The New York Times, was honored for Outstanding Service to the American Literary Community. Mr. Sulzberger was praised for helping to make possible the continuing coverage of books and literature. In her speech introducing Mr. Sulzberger, Terry Gross, the host of the NPR show ''Fresh Air,'' singled out the Times's Book Review in particular, saying it was like a ''shopping catalog'' that alerted her to ''authors I've overlooked.''
The award for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters went to the prolific and irreverent novelist Elmore Leonard, whose books are peopled with seedy characters, frequently armed with guns. It was only the second time that the award, which has been presented since 1988, went to a writer who was a popular favorite as opposed to a critically acclaimed legend. The first time was when the master of horror, Stephen King, won in 2003. Mr. King was also in the audience Wednesday night to help honor his friend.
Mr. Leonard, 87, took a humble tone. He compared himself with the English novelist Martin Amis, who introduced him, saying that Mr. Amis was a critically acclaimed writer and that he ''was a category on 'Jeopardy!' ''
Still, Mr. Leonard concluded by acknowledging that the award had meaning for him. ''I am energized by this honor. The only thing I've ever wanted to do in my life is tell stories, and this award tells me I am still good at it,'' he said.

HEADLINE: From the Mosh Pit To a Life in Balance

BYLINE: By MARY BILLARD

 BODY:
THE packed crowd celebrating the 25th anniversary of Revelation Records at Irving Plaza in Manhattan on an October night was predominately pierced, tattooed and male. The uniform was black T-shirts for hard-core rock bands like Behemoth (''100% Satanic''), Chain of Strength (''True Till Death'') and accessories like a ''Sick of It All'' baseball cap.
Ray Cappo, 46, one of the label's founders, took his place on the stage as the singer for the band Youth of Today, and shouted at the mosh pit, ''It's been 20 years but the message is still the same: Tear down the waaaalllll.'' 
The assembled responded with pumping one-arm salutes and staccato head jerks. Few questioned in the crowd knew that the heavy metal rocker on stage had left the Lower East Side in the late '80s, spending six years as a celibate monk, changing his name to Raghunath and becoming famous within the yoga world for classes featuring crazy inversions, variation upon variation of headstands, arm stands, handstands: a playbook of anti-gravity poses.
Raghunath left rock in a search for a personal true north, he said in an interview. ''The pleasure of fame at a young age was not what it was supposed to be,'' he recalled, quickly adding that the band was not Led Zeppelin. ''And it was juxtaposed with the sudden death of my father. Any idea of shelter or safety in a material world was getting dismantled.''
He found comfort in studying ancient yogi texts, meditation, chanting and long stints at an ashram in India. ''My passion is how to apply ancient philosophy in the modern world,'' he said. ''I teach a fun class so people come. A strong acrobatic class is the best way to get New York type-A personalities on the mat, and then the class is peppered with song and chanting and philosophy and ancient sacred texts.''
The classes, playfully dubbed Flight School, developed name recognition among yogis -- especially fellow teachers -- and they can credit or blame Raghunath's influence with the grade inflation on the mat these days, where open-level classes integrate a crow pose, or what children call frog, transitioning into handstands.
In early October, Raghunath taught a workshop to 40 students at House of Jai, a serene Upper East Side studio. On the surface, it is a stark contrast to the Irving Plaza gig. But in a way, Raghunath's metamorphosis is not as stark. The Youth of Today was a loud hardcore band, but one with a message the lead singer characterizes as one of positivity rather than nihilism. The transition to monk guru makes more sense in that context. ''We were unique in trying to have a positive attitude,'' Raghunath said. ''It was a radical message.''
In the class, Raghunath led devotional chanting in a melodic voice, accompanied by the harmonium. Then he began demonstrating poses in slow, controlled motions: in one acrobatic maneuver, he ended up upside down on one arm with legs spread -- no wall. By the end of the sequences, he was simply balancing on his head, arms and hands not touching the floor. Assisting students physically, weaving from mat to mat and laughing about the fleeting ''sensual pleasure'' of hitting the click button on Amazon, he repeated mantras as sweat poured down the students' faces.
Raghunath began teaching in Los Angeles in 2002, moving in 2008 to New York, where he had attracted a cultlike following at popular studios like Pure Yoga and Kula Yoga Project. His reputation grew: New York Magazine ran his photo doing a twisted human pretzel pose, and he was one of the select elite teachers christened Lululemon ambassadors by the high-end yoga line.
Over a year ago, Raghunath made another radical move. He and his wife, Bridget, who is known as Brij, decided to leave New York City for an upstate town for the well-being of his four children (ages 15, 13, 7 and 5), he said. Catching a Flight class became a little bit like a unicorn spotting. ''Watching the ridiculous asanas that he can do is a humbling experience,'' said Mike Patton of New York's Yoga Vida, where Raghunath has helped train teachers. ''There's no one like him, and then he packed up shop.''
Now that his family is settled, Raghunath is back on the circuit. His yoga career is being helped by YAMA Talent (Yoga Artists Management Agency), which is like the Creative Artists Agency for yoga stars. The concept may be anathema to yoga-world purists, but on deck is an embryonic clothing line starting with T-shirts. Next year, there will be two pilgrimages to India, an upstate retreat and continued training of teachers.
Ava Taylor of the agency explained that it has software to keep track of Raghunath bookings and it has worked on a sorely needed update of his Web site, which made its debut in May. ''I'm not the most organized person, so with YAMA it's like having a personal assistant so I can teach,'' Raghunath said.
An online series of live Webcam experiences of Raghunath teaching will be introduced soon, with devotional chanting, lectures on philosophy and nutrition, music tutorials and his calling card, crazy poses.
At the House of Jai workshop, Misa Watanabe, visiting from Tokyo, suggested that the yogi's appeal is broad. ''I cannot believe I took a class with him,'' she said, seeming surprised when asked how she knew about him. ''YouTube,'' she answered. Ms. Watanabe shyly went up to Raghunath and asked for a photo. He flashed a charismatic high-voltage grin, equal parts rock star and guru. Then he dashed to catch his flight to India.

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. de la MERCED, PETER LATTMAN, SUSANNE CRAIG and MARK SCOTT

 BODY:
BEYOND COFFEE Starbucks agreed on Wednesday to buy Teavana, a publicly traded seller of high-end teas, for $620 million in cash.
The terms call for Starbucks, led by Howard Schultz, left, to pay $15.50 a share, a 53 percent premium to Teavana's closing price on Tuesday. Starbucks estimates the tea market at about $40 billion. It already has a presence in the sector with its Tazo brand. MICHAEL J. de la MERCED 
SLIMMER CLASS Goldman Sachs announced on Wednesday that it had selected 70 executives to become partners, the smallest class size since the company went public in 1999.
The small class size is indicative of the new economics on Wall Street. Goldman and other firms have been cutting their payrolls in the wake of new regulations that have forced firms out of some businesses and pushed them to hold more capital in other areas. SUSANNE CRAIG
MULTINATIONAL MERGER Fulbright & Jaworski, the Houston-based law firm, said Wednesday that it had agreed to merge with the British firm Norton Rose, creating a 3,800-lawyer behemoth with 55 offices around the world.
''Fulbright's combination with Norton Rose will expand our global platform and enable us to provide an even broader range of services to our clients,'' Steven Pfeiffer, left, chairman of Fulbright & Jaworski's executive committee, said in a statement. PETER LATTMAN
BIGGER MARKET SHARE The British soft drink makers Britvic and A. G. Barr agreed on Wednesday to a merger in an all-stock deal worth around $2.3 billion.
Under the terms of the deal, shareholders in Britvic will own a 63 percent stake in the combined company, while A. G. Barr's investors will hold 37 percent. The merged company will have annual revenue of 1.5 billion, or $2.4 billion, making it one of Europe's largest soft drink makers. MARK SCOTT

HEADLINE: For Obama, No Easy Fix for Convoluted Regulatory System

BYLINE: By JESSE EISINGER. 
Jesse Eisinger is a reporter for ProPublica, an independent, nonprofit newsroom that produces investigative journalism in the public interest. E-mail: jesse@propublica.org Twitter: @eisingerj.

 BODY:
In President Obama's second term, financial regulation would finally appear to have the leverage.
Wall Street spent zillions on Mitt Romney, who had promised to roll back financial reform, and lost. Elizabeth Warren now sits in the world's greatest deliberative body. With the election behind us, regulators are likely to be less intimidated by the specter of being hauled in front of Congress and yelled at, especially by House Republicans.
Already, the Obama administration has been moving to install tougher regulators than it had in the early part of its tenure. The early first-term financial regulatory heads were either conciliators or placeholders. Mary L. Schapiro had to reinvigorate a Securities and Exchange Commission that was demoralized from its failures to catch Bernard L. Madoff and to foresee the financial crisis. Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner had to deal with the 2008 crisis and its aftermath, and sidelined banking accountability. Others - like John G. Walsh, who was the acting comptroller of the currency, and Edward DeMarco, who is the acting director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency - have been perceived by reformers as active roadblocks. 
The second-generation appointees, like the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's Richard Cordray and the new comptroller of the currency, Thomas J. Curry, actually evince a desire to regulate.
What's more, the pace of regulation should accelerate. Regulators have been slow-walking the Dodd-Frank overhaul. Only a third of the rules have been completed - and worse, a third haven't even been proposed, according to the law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell. And it only got worse as we approached the election, because nothing is more abominable to Washington regulators than to become an election issue. If a decision could be ducked or a rule delayed, they did it. At that pace, financial reform would have been completed sometime in the second term of the Sasha Obama administration.
Surely, reformers can now ride in and save the day, right?
Alas, no. While the rule making will speed up, the core problems with the financial system and its regulators are deeper than personnel and sadly impervious to which party occupies the White House. They are bipartisan and structural.
The examples of bipartisan cowardice and ineptitude are legion, but one of the most telling involves a particularly dispiriting disappointment of Ms. Schapiro's tenure at the S.E.C.: the failure to figure out a solution for money market funds, which are able to mask their risk under the current rules. It was a shared fumble, with a Democratic commissioner joining Republicans in proposing more study of the topic in order to issue a report calling for more study.
The structural issues go deeper. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission still exist as two separate agencies, a huge missed opportunity for Dodd-Frank and one borne of politics. The C.F.T.C. is protected (and bashed) by the Senate Agriculture Committee, the S.E.C. by the Senate Banking Committee. Merging the agencies would mean that one of those committees would lose power, so forget about that. Gary Gensler, the head of the commodities commission, has been tough, but has been limited by his agency's paltry resources. And, anyway, these agencies are still run by commissions, not single heads, and they rely on Congress for their financing. It's little surprise that such a structure creates plodding impotence.
"One of the biggest weaknesses of Dodd-Frank is that we failed to look long and hard at true independence of regulators," a frustrated and regretful Senate staff member, who worked on the legislation, told me the other day.
This failure plays out in almost comical ways. The market for credit-default swaps, a common derivative, is unified in the business world, but its regulation is split between the C.F.T.C. and the S.E.C. The solution was to let the C.F.T.C. oversee swap indexes of 10 or more components, with the S.E.C. regulating trades in single-company swaps and - get this - indexes with up to nine components. In the real world, traders go long (or short) indexes of credit-default swaps and hedge with the individual names or vice versa. So, how's that supposed to be overseen? When one agency looks over one half of the trade, the other regulators are mandated to close their eyes, put their hands over their ears and say, "La la la la la la la"? Don't worry: The regulators are hard at work jury-rigging a fix as I write this.
Or take the Volcker Rule, one of the most prominent symbols of the financial overhaul. The rule, which was intended to prevent banks from speculating with money backed by taxpayers, is still not finished almost two and a half years after Dodd-Frank passed. It's the subject of multiple-agency negotiations, which are going about as well as that phrase would suggest. Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, had called on the regulators to finish up by Labor Day. That came and went. Senators Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, and Jeff Merkley, Democrat of Oregon, the authors of the provision, fired off a letter a few weeks ago, urging the regulators to finish their work.
Now, it would be good if regulators were assiduously working to simplify the rule, which is a bloated monstrosity filled with loopholes and exemptions. But they aren't. Instead, they're squabbling over petty turf issues.
In "Bleak House," Dickens wrote of a legal case: "This scarecrow of a suit has, in course of time, become so complicated that no man alive knows what it means." Today, he would set the novel in Congress. Dodd-Frank is so sweeping in scope yet so picayune in application that it will be close to impossible for the public to tell whether it's making a difference.
No second term can alter that.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Gift, and New Name, for Mt. Sinai School

BYLINE: By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS

 BODY:
In the ultimate friendly merger, the corporate raider Carl C. Icahn is giving $200 million to the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in Manhattan, which will be renamed in his honor. 
Mr. Icahn actually attended medical school at New York University for two years, pressed by his mother, Bella. But he dropped out because he ''hated it,'' he said Wednesday.
''My mother would be proud of me today,'' Mr. Icahn, 76, said. ''My name is involved with a medical school.''
Henceforth, the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, on the Upper East Side, will be known as the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.
Mr. Icahn said his gift was influenced by what he called the socialist legacy of his father, Michael, a ''dogmatic atheist'' who nonetheless worked as a cantor after he did not achieve his ambition of being a singer at the Metropolitan Opera.
Of the medical school, Mr. Icahn said, ''It does help the people that aren't that fortunate,'' adding that he had chosen his other philanthropic ventures -- like several charter schools -- for the same reason. ''I do feel there is too much disparity in the city between the wealthy and the not wealthy.''
The Icahn gift comprises about $50 million already given and an additional $150 million still to come, said Dr. Kenneth L. Davis, president and chief executive of the Mount Sinai Medical Center, which includes the school.
Dr. Davis said the gift had been nurtured over nine years of dinners and discussions with Mr. Icahn, a medical school trustee, and would be heavily devoted to building research capability.
The naming of New York City medical schools appears to have undergone some inflation. Mr. Icahn's gift is double the $100 million that Sanford I. Weill, the Wall Street deal maker, pledged, with his wife, Joan, before Cornell University's medical college was named for them in 1998. In 2008, Kenneth G.

HEADLINE: Obama Details Lines of Battle In Budget Plan

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER; Annie Lowrey and Jennifer Steinhauer contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama, riding the winds of re-election, signaled Wednesday that he was prepared to battle with Republicans over budget negotiations and his national security team's handling of the deadly attack on an American mission in Libya.
Displaying a mix of resolve and restraint, Mr. Obama flatly rejected any budget deal that did not raise tax rates on income above $250,000 a year, even if it meant driving the economy into a recession. But he did not rule out a compromise that could leave the top tax rates lower than their levels during the Clinton administration, presumably combined with a restriction on some tax breaks for top earners.
For a president fresh off a hard-fought victory, Mr. Obama projected little of the triumphalism of other newly re-elected leaders like Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush, who boasted in 2004 that he had amassed political capital and planned ''to spend it.''
Mr. Obama instead cloaked his tough stance in the language of compromise, saying he was ''familiar with all the literature about presidential overreach in second terms,'' and that his re-election was not a mandate to ram his proposals through Congress without any concessions. 
In his first formal news conference in eight months, which was meant to position Mr. Obama for the coming fiscal battles but ended up including a C.I.A. scandal and a vitriolic fight over who is to blame for the attack on the American diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, the president saved his most fiery words to defend his ambassador to the United Nations, Susan E. Rice. Ms. Rice, a candidate for secretary of state, has come under withering attack from Senator John McCain and other Republicans for suggesting that the siege in Benghazi that killed four Americans was a spontaneous protest rather than a premeditated terrorist attack.
''For them to go after the U.N. ambassador, who had nothing to do with Benghazi and was simply making a presentation based on the intelligence that she had received, and to besmirch her reputation, is outrageous,'' Mr. Obama said, his eyes flashing with anger.
Describing Ms. Rice's conduct as ''exemplary,'' he warned that her critics have ''got a problem with me.'' Almost daring them to a confirmation battle, he vowed to nominate Ms. Rice if he determined that she was the right person for secretary of state.
Mr. Obama's remarks drew an equally angry response from Senators McCain and Lindsey Graham. In a statement issued after the news conference, Mr. Graham reiterated that he would oppose ''anyone who is up to their eyeballs in the Benghazi debacle.''
By contrast, the president struck an almost elegiac tone in discussing the sex scandal that forced the resignation of David H. Petraeus as director of the Central Intelligence Agency. Mr. Petraeus, he said, told him that he did not meet his own standards for holding the job.
But, Mr. Obama added, ''We are safer because of the work Dave Petraeus has done,'' voicing hope that the scandal would end up as a ''single side note on what has otherwise been an extraordinary career.''
Mr. Obama was cautious in responding to questions about whether he should have been told earlier about the investigation into the relationship between Mr. Petraeus and his biographer, Paula Broadwell, with the president saying that he would leave it to the F.B.I. to explain its ''protocols.'' But while he offered no criticism of the investigation, he appeared to leave himself room to do so in the future, should new information emerge.
''I am withholding judgment with respect to how the entire process surrounding General Petraeus came up,'' he said.
In laying out his position on the budget, Mr. Obama emphasized that debate over taxes had been central to the election he just won and reprised many of the themes he had struck on the campaign trail. The president urged Republicans to go along with his proposal to extend the Bush-era tax cuts on all personal income up to $250,000 a year, noting that people who made more than that amount would also benefit from such an extension.
''But when it comes to the top 2 percent, what I'm not going to do is extend further a tax cut for folks who don't need it, which would cost close to a trillion dollars,'' Mr. Obama said.
While he insisted that the tax cuts for income above $250,000 must expire, Mr. Obama did not stipulate that the top rate would revert to 39.6 percent, as it was in the Clinton administration. Mr. Bush signed a bill a decade ago reducing it to 35 percent, where it has remained.
Mr. Obama's stance appeared to leave room for the White House and Republicans to negotiate a tax rate somewhere in between and then raise additional revenue by restricting tax deductions and credits on high incomes. ''I don't expect Republicans simply to adopt my budget,'' he said. ''That's not realistic. So I recognize that we're going to have to compromise.''
Still, Mr. Obama said he could envision a situation in which there was no agreement and all the tax cuts expired. Such an outcome would be a ''rude shock'' for middle-class people, he said, and could set off a recession.
''It would be a bad thing,'' he said. ''It is not necessary.''
By suggesting he was willing to accept failed negotiations, Mr. Obama was in part trying to give himself more leverage than in 2010, when fears about the economy and its impact on his political standing caused him to reverse course and accept an extension of all the Bush tax cuts in exchange for additional stimulus. This time, however, the economy is somewhat stronger, Mr. Obama has no more elections in front of him -- as he pointed out on Wednesday -- and the package of budget changes set to take effect on Jan. 1 includes both tax increases and military cuts that Republicans generally oppose.
Speaker John A. Boehner, the effective leader of the Republican Party, said Republicans were not ready to accept Mr. Obama's proposal because it would ''hurt our economy and make job creation more difficult.'' But he added that there was a ''spirit of cooperation'' that had infused Washington and that gave him optimism that some sort of deal would eventually come to pass.
Republicans say they will find a way to raise enough money to reduce the deficit without lifting the top rates. Back-of-the-envelope math suggests that eliminating all tax breaks for the top 2 percent of households would raise about $2 trillion over 10 years, more than the $1.6 trillion that the White House demands, as part of a $3 trillion deficit-reduction package over 10 years. But having all of the additional tax revenue come from the restriction of tax breaks would require getting rid of virtually every such provision, like the home-mortgage deduction, in the tax code on top incomes.
''The math tends not to work,'' Mr. Obama said.
Allowing tax rates to rise on the wealthy -- to the Clinton-era levels, or a few percentage points below them -- puts much more money on the table and would allow more moderate changes to deductions, Democrats argue.
Looking beyond the immediate fiscal challenges, Mr. Obama expressed optimism about one major goal -- immigration legislation -- and caution about another, climate change.
The president said he intended to pursue comprehensive immigration legislation, and noted that the election had prompted reflection among Republicans about their opposition to such an effort. Even as he criticized Mr. McCain on Benghazi, he cited his support for an overhaul of immigration law as an indication that it could pass.
On climate change, Mr. Obama played down expectations for any major initiative. He spoke of holding a conversation with scientists and engineers about fresh ideas, but said more ambitious legislation would come only after the economy strengthened.
''We're still trying to debate whether we can just make sure that middle-class families don't get a tax hike,'' he said. ''That should be easy. This one's hard.''

HEADLINE: Standing Tougher

 BODY:
Everyone was waiting to see if President Obama would be fiery and combative on Wednesday at his first post-election news conference -- specifically on how tough a stand he would take on the so-called fiscal-cliff talks. And, as it transpired, the president who stood before reporters was nearly unrecognizable from the President Obama who, for four years, clung to a misguided belief in a postpartisan Washington where reasonable people sit down to work out solutions.
After a few days of public dancing around by members of Congress on the fiscal-cliff talks, the most important, immediate thing Mr. Obama did was to be unequivocal about his bottom-line position: the Bush tax cuts for the middle class should be extended right now, with the rest allowed to expire, and then he is willing to talk about closing tax loopholes, and tax reform and spending cuts. 
''What I'm not going to do is to extend Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest 2 percent that we can't afford and, according to economists, will have the least positive impact on our economy,'' Mr. Obama said. After the campaign, Mr. Obama said, ''this shouldn't be a surprise to anybody,'' noting that more Americans said they favored a tax increase on the rich than actually voted for him.
Mr. Obama was at his most fiery and combative when he was asked about the killings at the American consulate in Benghazi, Libya, and a threat by Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham to block him if he decides to nominate Susan Rice, the ambassador to the United Nations, to be secretary of state in his second term. Republicans have been attacking Ms. Rice for saying five days after the killings that they may have grown out of a spontaneous protest over an anti-Islamic video.
''She has represented the United States and our interests in the United Nations with skill and professionalism and toughness and grace,'' he said.
''If Senator McCain and Senator Graham and others want to go after somebody, they should go after me,'' he said. ''And I'm happy to have that discussion with them. But for them to go after the U.N. ambassador, who had nothing to do with Benghazi, and was simply making a presentation based on intelligence that she had received, and to besmirch her reputation is outrageous.''
Mr. Obama let his annoyance flash with unfamiliar clarity when he said that if he decides that Ms. Rice is the right choice for secretary of state, ''then I will nominate her.''
There were moments when Mr. Obama was not as crisply clear as he might have been. He was a bit vague, for example, about global warming. He seemed to be preparing Americans for the fact that Congress will never approve a carbon tax through a cap-and-trade scheme, but he said he was committed to regulatory reform. He also said he was committed to immigration reform, starting by putting into law the regulatory version of the Dream Act, which would allow young immigrants and students to get on a path to legal status.
But his main focus was on the immediate talks about averting the fiscal cliff: the potential for a simultaneous expiring of the Bush-era tax cuts on everyone, and the imposition of across-the-board spending cuts known as the ''sequester.'' The combination would be very dangerous for the slow recovery.
The first step, he said, is to pass, by next week, a law that extends tax cuts for middle-class Americans -- on the first $250,000 of income, which Mr. Obama noted would be benefit richer Americans as well. ''Half of the danger to our economy is removed by that single step,'' he said. ''And what we can then do is shape a process whereby we look at tax reform, which I'm very eager to do.'' That could include closing loopholes, which some Republicans are now holding out as the solution for the deficit crisis, but that would not be sufficient.
Mr. Obama said that extending tax cuts to the wealthy would cost close to $1 trillion, ''and it's very difficult to see how you make up that trillion dollars, if we're serious about deficit reduction, just by closing loopholes and deductions. You know, the math tends not to work.''
Mr. Obama -- and the members of Congress who have been preening before the cameras about the fiscal cliff -- left some big issues unaddressed. Tax rates are not the only issue that has to be resolved. The alternative minimum income tax will once again spread lower through the tax brackets if nothing is done; the enhancement of the earned-income tax credit that was part of the stimulus package needs to be extended, along with long-term federal unemployment benefits. Mr. Obama also left open the question of how to avoid the threatened sequester, which would take effect in January if Congress does not reach an agreement to cancel it. He may simply be holding out that threat as a cudgel for negotiators, but it is an issue he will have to address relatively soon.
Mr. Obama's other challenge is to keep up the pressure on Congress to reach a deal by taking his case to the public. That kind of follow-through has never been his strong suit, but it has to be now.

HEADLINE: F.H.A. May Need Help

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: The F.H.A. is said to be experiencing escalating losses. | Greece is once again considering pressuring private sector creditors to accept a deal. | A Congressional reports delivers "a withering critique" of Jon S. Corzine over MF Global. | President Obama begins efforts to mend fences with the business community. 

 BODY:
Just when it seemed that the mortgage mess was ending, the Federal Housing Administration, the agency that insurers home mortgages, is said to be experiencing escalating losses. The agency's latest annual report is expected to show a shortfall in reserves, leading to speculation that the agency may need assistance from the Treasury Department, Gretchen Morgenson reports in The New York Times. "If the report, due later this week, showed that the F.H.A.'s capital reserves had fallen deep into negative territory, it would be a stark reversal from projections last year that it would show a positive economic value of $9.4 billion in 2012."
Even amid signs of improvement in the housing market, delinquencies are rising among the mortgages insured by the F.H.A. More than one in six of those loans are delinquent 30 days or more, according to Edward Pinto, a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute who specializes in housing. The agency's "loans are too risky and that has to be addressed," Mr. Pinto said. "It's not the legacy book that's creating all the problems. It's beyond that." The New York Times reporter Binyamin Appelbaum said on Twitter that the agency's plight amounted to "a housing crisis predicted by pretty much everyone." 
A decision over whether the agency would need money from the Treasury would not come until February, when the White House releases its annual budget, The Wall Street Journal notes. "Administration officials could announce measures that would either avert the need to draw on the Treasury or cushion the blow of such a move, such as raising mortgage-insurance premiums and finalizing additional legal settlements with lenders, industry analysts expect," the newspaper writes.
 Financial regulation is not likely to become less convoluted in President Obama's second term, Jesse Eisinger writes in his DealBook column, The Trade. While recently appointed officials are actually showing "a desire to regulate," the regulatory agencies are beset by deep "structural issues," Mr. Eisinger says. For example, the fact that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission exist as two separate agencies represents "a huge missed opportunity for Dodd-Frank."
GREECE CONSIDERS DEBT BUYBACK | Greece is once again considering pressuring its private sector creditors to accept a deal. This time, the government would propose "that its private sector bondholders sell back their sovereign debt holdings for a small profit, but at a price favorable to Greece," Landon Thomas Jr. reports in The New York Times. The move would be a radical one, and some investors would likely balk at the prospect, Mr. Thomas writes. Still, it could reduce Greece's ever-increasing debt burden. "A small circle of lawyers and bankers are suggesting that Greece offer to buy back its deeply discounted debt at a price of 27 to 33 euro cents, compared with the 25-cent level where it currently trades."
LAWMAKERS ATTACK CORZINE OVER MF GLOBAL | In a report to be released on Thursday, Congressional investigators "outlined a withering critique" of Jon S. Corzine for his role in accelerating the collapse of the brokerage firm MF Global, DealBook's Ben Protess reports. Mr. Corzine, who resigned as the firm's chief executive last year, was the "de facto chief trader," taking too much risk and missing warning signs, according to the report.
Still, the report looks unlikely to pose significant legal headaches for Mr. Corzine. It avoids blaming him directly for the customer money that went missing, Mr. Protess writes. And supporters of Mr. Corzine, a onetime senator, may have "an avenue for dismissing the report as a political attack on the former Democratic politician."
OBAMA EXTENDS OLIVE BRANCH | The president began his efforts at mending fences with the business community as he met with leaders on Wednesday to seek their support on fiscal issues. "While Mr. Obama did not present a detailed plan at Wednesday's meeting or reveal what he would propose in terms of new corporate taxes, he strongly reiterated that he would not allow tax cuts for the middle class to expire," Helene Cooper and Nelson D. Schwartz write. "The corporate leaders seemed pleased with the tone of the meeting but cautious about the prospect of finding common ground with the White House on the budget choices facing Congress and the president."
ON THE AGENDA | The comptroller of the currency, Thomas Curry, is giving a keynote speech at the Clearing House's second annual business meeting and conference at 8:30 a.m. In New Orleans, Robert S. Khuzami, the Securities and Exchange Commission's director of enforcement, is speaking at the American Bar Association's National Institute on Securities Fraud conference, at 10 a.m. Eastern time. Sears, Target, Viacom and Wal-Mart report earnings before the opening bell. Dell and Gap announce results Thursday evening. The Consumer Price Index for October is released at 8:30 a.m. Erskine B. Bowles, who is viewed as a contender to be the next Treasury secretary, is on CNBC at 4:10 p.m. Glenn Hubbard, who was Mitt Romney's chief economic adviser, is on Bloomberg TV at 4 p.m.
FUND MANAGERS WARM TO TECH COMPANIES | A flurry of regulatory filings on Wednesday shed some light on new positions by prominent fund managers. Tiger Global Management, for instance, increased its stake in Facebook by 9.79 million shares in the third quarter, to 11.75 million shares, Bloomberg News reports. Soros Fund Management added 1.2 million shares of LinkedIn, according to The Wall Street Journal. Andreessen Horowitz, the venture capital firm, held on to the bulk of its direct investment in Facebook, while distributing more than 3 million Facebook shares it received from the sale of Instagram, AllThingsD reports. David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital amassed 5.1 million shares of Yahoo, but cut its stake in Apple.
 GEFFEN'S NEW DIGS | 
David Geffen, the DreamWorks co-founder, has paid $54 million for a penthouse duplex on Manhattan's Upper East Side, according to The Wall Street Journal. The price is 17 percent less than what the previous owner, the socialite Denise Rich, was asking, but it still sets a record for a Manhattan co-op, according to Jonathan Miller of the real estate appraisal firm Miller Samuel.

"A small circle of lawyers and bankers are suggesting that Greece offer to buy back its deeply discounted debt at a price of 27 to 33 euro cents, compared with the 25-cent level where it currently trades."
LAWMAKERS ATTACK CORZINE OVER MF GLOBAL | In a report to be released on Thursday, Congressional investigators "outlined a withering critique" of Jon S. Corzine for his role in accelerating the collapse of the brokerage firm MF Global, DealBook's Ben Protess reports. Mr. Corzine, who resigned as the firm's chief executive last year, was the "de facto chief trader," taking too much risk and missing warning signs, according to the report.
Still, the report looks unlikely to pose significant legal headaches for Mr. Corzine. It avoids blaming him directly for the customer money that went missing, Mr. Protess writes. And supporters of Mr. Corzine, a onetime senator, may have "an avenue for dismissing the report as a political attack on the former Democratic politician."
OBAMA EXTENDS OLIVE BRANCH | The president began his efforts at mending fences with the business community as he met with leaders on Wednesday to seek their support on fiscal issues. "While Mr. Obama did not present a detailed plan at Wednesday's meeting or reveal what he would propose in terms of new corporate taxes, he strongly reiterated that he would not allow tax cuts for the middle class to expire," Helene Cooper and Nelson D. Schwartz write. "The corporate leaders seemed pleased with the tone of the meeting but cautious about the prospect of finding common ground with the White House on the budget choices facing Congress and the president."
ON THE AGENDA | The comptroller of the currency, Thomas Curry, is giving a keynote speech at the Clearing House's second annual business meeting and conference at 8:30 a.m. In New Orleans, Robert S.

Bowles, who is viewed as a contender to be the next Treasury secretary, is on CNBC at 4:10 p.m. Glenn Hubbard, who was Mitt Romney's chief economic adviser, is on Bloomberg TV at 4 p.m.
FUND MANAGERS WARM TO TECH COMPANIES | A flurry of regulatory filings on Wednesday shed some light on new positions by prominent fund managers. Tiger Global Management, for instance, increased its stake in Facebook by 9.79 million shares in the third quarter, to 11.75 million shares, Bloomberg News reports. Soros Fund Management added 1.2 million shares of LinkedIn, according to The Wall Street Journal. Andreessen Horowitz, the venture capital firm, held on to the bulk of its direct investment in Facebook, while distributing more than 3 million Facebook shares it received from the sale of Instagram, AllThingsD reports. David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital amassed 5.1 million shares of Yahoo, but cut its stake in Apple.
 GEFFEN'S NEW DIGS | 
David Geffen, the DreamWorks co-founder, has paid $54 million for a penthouse duplex on Manhattan's Upper East Side, according to The Wall Street Journal. The price is 17 percent less than what the previous owner, the socialite Denise Rich, was asking, but it still sets a record for a Manhattan co-op, according to Jonathan Miller of the real estate appraisal firm Miller Samuel.

HEADLINE: A Global Shift in Foreign Aid, Starting in India

BYLINE: NIHARIKA MANDHANA


HIGHLIGHT: Britain's decision to cut aid to India after decades comes as developed countries worldwide rethink what they give. 

 BODY:
Britain's decision to stop giving development aid to India by 2015 marks a turning point in the former colonial power's relations with New Delhi, and is raising questions about the global future of foreign aid in a fast-changing economic world order.
"Having visited India I have seen firsthand the tremendous progress being made," the British development secretary, Justine Greening,said Nov. 9, while announcing the end of more than 50 years of aid to India. "India is successfully developing, and our own bilateral relationship has to keep up with 21st century India," she said.

Britain's move may be just the first in a full-scale pullback of aid to faster-growing developing nations, some aid professionals believe.
"There is a real concern that all the major donors are looking at excluding emerging economies from their aid programs," Emma Seery, the head of development finance at Oxfam, said by telephone. "These countries have large pockets of poverty, and we are afraid that this trend will remove this extra lifeline from the poorest," she said.
For decades, the United Nations has urged developed countries to spend 0.7 percent of their national income on aid to poorer nations, a target that continues to be elusive. According to the most recent figures of the Development Assistance Committee, a consortium of the world's main donors, the developed world gave nearly $120 billion in assistance to the developing world in 2009, or 0.32 percent.
The United States, which doled out some $30 billion in 2010, leads the pack.
But many traditional donors are now openly reconsidering the need for, and role of, foreign aid. The United States, for example, facing a budget crisis, has considered proposals to significantly trim the billions in foreign aid it gives. "The proposals have raised the spectre of deep cuts in food and medicine for Africa, in relief for disaster-affected places like Pakistan and Japan, in political and economic assistance for the new democracies of the Middle East, and even for the Peace Corps," Steven Lee Myers wrote in The New York Timeslast year.
U.S. aid to India, targeted toward clean energy, food security and health, has dropped 25 percent in recent years, from nearly $127 million in 2010 to a proposed $98.3 million in 2013. India's emergence as a regional and global power, the 2012 annual letter from the U.S. Agency for International Development said, "creates an opportunity to evolve the traditional donor recipient model of development into a true partnership."
This threatened drought of Western aid comes as some emerging market countries, including India, have themselves become donors to more impoverished countries.
Before a visit this week from President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan, aimed at wooing investment, India approved development projects in Afghanistan to the tune of $100 million as part of India's $2 billion aid package to the war-torn country. In 2010, the country extended a $1 billion line of credit to Bangladesh, the highest ever one-time assistance, and last year, it offered $5 billion in credit to African nations. With a broadening aid portfolio, New Delhi recently announced plans to set up its own aid agency.
For India, once the world's largest foreign aid recipient, with some $55 billion funneled to the country between 1951 and 1992, the change from recipient to donor comes as the country tries to redefine its role in the international community.
For decades, as India made its haphazard transition from being a British colony to an economic powerhouse, it depended heavily on aid from prosperous nations and international institutions. In 1958, for instance, Britain offered India some [#x20a4]40 million in foreign aid, as India struggled to build a nation and implement its second five-year economic plan. British Treasury officials referred to the "long-term problems of Indian development" when announcing the package.
Sixty years later, Britain's decision to pull the plug on funding to India was met with little more than a shrug by India's political class. "We don't really need the aid," P. Chidambaram, the finance minister, said last week. "We have accepted it in the past, but I think both countries have agreed that we can emphasize on trade rather than aid."
Part of the reason for such nonchalance, analysts say, is that British aid to India, which amounts to $450 million per year and is used primarily in health care and education, is small. Last year, the finance minister at the time, Pranab Mukherjee, reportedly dismissed the funds as "peanuts" compared to India's own spending. (Mr. Mukherjee is now the president of India.)
Indeed, in recent years, India has ramped up its spending on social welfare programs, including a large rural employment scheme and a food subsidy system, aimed at lifting its millions out of poverty.
But perhaps more significant is the fact that India now sees - and projects - itself as a global power and a partner to developed nations like Britain, rejecting the traditional model of rich nations aiding poor ones. "Aid is past, trade is future," Foreign Minister Salman Khurshid recentlysaid.
This ambition stems from the Indian economy, which, even with a recent slackening, continues to grow at a faster rate than other large economies. In 2007, the World Bank moved India to a "lower middle income" country from a "low income" one. But, activists point out, it continues to be a country of rampant poverty and vast inequities. Despite two decades of growth, over 400 million people in India live on less than $1.25 a day, and the country's malnutrition figures are among the worst in the world. India has had some success with its welfare programs, but it spends only 0.9 percent of gross domestic product on health care, among the lowest in the world, and 3 percent on education.
This dichotomy appears to be in tune with global trends in poverty. A 2010 study by economist Andy Sumner at the Institute of Development Studies titled "The New Bottom Billion" found that two decades ago, 93 percent of the world's poorest lived in low-income countries. Now, nearly three-quarters of them, or one billion people, live in middle-income economies.
Economists at the Asian Development Bank, too, speak of a "middle income trap," where rapid growth in short periods of time is followed by economic stagnation. While India is growing fast, said Rana Hasan, ADB's principal economist in India, "historical record tells us this is not the time to disengage."
In recent years, ADB, which focuses primarily on infrastructure projects in India, has moved its focus from large nationwide projects such as highways and power grids to development projects in "lagging" states, like Bihar, Chattisgarh and Assam.
British aid in India, said Ms. Seery of Oxfam, has a "real and significant impact," and its withdrawal could have significant negative repercussions for its poorest. It has played a major role, she said, in India's successful drive to eliminate polio, and it continues to help children attend primary schools and to give women and children access to good health care. "The decision to unaid," Ms. Seery said, "was too hasty from a development perspective."
Some Indian analysts argue that the decision has less to do with India's development than Britain's own political and economic compulsions. In recent years, Britain has become home to a strong anti-aid sentiment, with a section of the political class arguing that India, which has its own space program, no longer needs aid from Britain, itself in the throes of an economic slowdown.
In a by The Guardian newspaper, which asked if Britain should stop granting aid to India "in response to its former colony's 'rapid growth and development progress' over the past decade," 89 percent responded in the affirmative.
Others say Britain's new approach stems from the absence of quid pro quo. Last year, India's decision to select a French company over its British rival for a multi-billion dollar contract to supply fighter planes caused great furor in London, with several British politicians saying India ought to have favored the British company on account of the millions it receives in aid from Britain.
"They believe that British aid must get a bang for its buck, which means it must spread British influence," said Jayati Ghosh, a professor of economics at Jawaharlal National University in New Delhi. "The aid is just not doing that anymore."

HIGHLIGHT: You're all takers. 

 BODY:
Lots of people having fun with Mitt Romney's post-election diagnosis, which is that President Obama played dirty: he won peoples' votes by -- horrors -- actually making their lives better:
"With regards to the young people, for instance, a forgiveness of college loan interest was a big gift," Mr. Romney said. "Free contraceptives were very big with young, college-aged women. And then, finally, Obamacare also made a difference for them, because as you know, anybody now 26 years of age and younger was now going to be part of their parents' plan, and that was a big gift to young people. They turned out in large numbers, a larger share in this election even than in 2008."
The president's health care plan, he said, was also a useful tool in mobilizing black and Hispanic voters. Though Mr. Romney won the white vote with 59 percent, according to exit polls, minorities coalesced around the president in overwhelming numbers: 93 percent of blacks and 71 percent of Hispanics.
"You can imagine for somebody making $25,000 or $30,000 or $35,000 a year, being told you're now going to get free health care, particularly if you don't have it, getting free health care worth, what, $10,000 per family, in perpetuity - I mean, this is huge," Mr. Romney said. "Likewise with Hispanic voters, free health care was a big plus. But in addition with regards to Hispanic voters, the amnesty for children of illegals, the so-called Dream Act kids, was a huge plus for that voting group." 
Gosh. People who will have health insurance under Obama but would have lost it under Romney voted for Obama. What's wrong with those people?
But as many commentators have pointed out, Romney was just encapsulating the prevalent worldview on the right. Some of us see an increasingly, radically unequal America, with rising inequality actually reinforced by public policy, with tax rates on the rich lower than they have been in many decades and the overall redistributive effect of government down substantially since the 1970s. But the right sees an entitlement epidemic, in which the big problem is that too many people are getting free stuff.
It's important to understand the roots of this stuff. It began as a deliberate appeal to racism, with explicit condemnation of Those People as welfare moochers. Then it became more coded; Rick Perlstein posts the original, famous Lee Atwater interview containing the memorable passage,
You start out in 1954 by saying, "Nigger, nigger, nigger." By 1968 you can't say "nigger"-that hurts you, backfires. So you say stuff like, uh, forced busing, states' rights, and all that stuff, and you're getting so abstract. Now, you're talking about cutting taxes, and all these things you're talking about are totally economic things and a byproduct of them is, blacks get hurt worse than whites. "We want to cut this," is much more abstract than even the busing thing, uh, and a hell of a lot more abstract than "Nigger, nigger." 
What Mitt Romney is now complaining about is the horrifying reality that many people who aren't black see themselves as victims of those "economic things" -- and as a result anti-government rhetoric is turning into a way to lose elections rather than win them.
And I don't think the Republican party as currently constituted can change this: after 45 years of the Southern strategy, this stuff is what defines the party's soul.

HEADLINE: Taxpayers at Risk As Storm Bills Come Due

BYLINE: FELICITY BARRINGER


HIGHLIGHT: Whether they live near the coast or not, state taxpayers and insurance ratepayers are likely to be on the hook when damage from hurricanes exceeds insurance policy reserves. 

 BODY:
The states along the Gulf of Mexico and the southeastern Atlantic coast have plenty of experience when it comes to rebuilding after hurricanes. As Eric Lipton, Mary Williams Walsh and I reported this week, those residents are accustomed to turning to the National Flood Insurance Program for the money needed to rebuild -- so much so that the program is nearly $18 billion in debt. And the program is likely to exceed its ability to borrow from the federal Treasury when the bills for Hurricane Sandy come due.
But federal taxpayers are not the only big group sharing the cost of decisions to build or rebuild in vulnerable coastal areas, where commercial insurers are reluctant to write policies and international reinsurance firms are even more reluctant to get involved. 
As a result, for more than two decades state taxpayers and the ratepayers for state insurance plans have been effectively backstopping when it comes time for insurers to pay for wind damage, fire damage and vandalism, none of which are covered by flood insurance. 
According to a detailed study by Robert Hartwig, an economist and the president of the Insurance Information Institute, and his colleague Claire Wilkinson, these Fair Access to Insurance (FAIR) plans, along with beach and wind plans, covered 3.3 million individual homes and businesses in 2011 in both coastal and urban areas. The total value of the insured properties that year was $884.7 billion.

The largest of these plans, the Florida Citizens Property Insurance company, was $2 billion in debt after the four-hurricane season of 2004 and Hurricane Katrina in 2005 but made money in the relatively storm-free six years that followed. More than three-quarters of Florida's population lives in coastal counties.
 The Louisiana plan, Louisiana Citizens Property Insurance Corporation, ran a deficit of $954 million in 2005. 
As Hurricane Sandy has shown, New York City and Long Island have an extremely high potential for economic loss from storm damage, one that is topped only by Florida's. 
 But most of the plans, the report said, are one large hurricane away from debts that either state treasuries or ratepayers anywhere in the state who own any kind of insurance -- life insurance, car insurance, home insurance -- will have to make good on. In surveys of state taxpayers, the farther a respondent was from the coast, the more negative the view on the subsidy was. 
"As long as these plans continue to grow," the report's authors wrote, "state finances will remain under threat." Ultimately, taxpayers, many of whom live nowhere near the coast, "will continue to face the prospect" of paying higher taxes or higher premiums, they said.
The political blowback that ensues when premiums increase, as they did in Florida after the stormy years of 2004 and 2005, is considerable. Erwann Michel-Kerjan, an economist and managing director of a Wharton School center on risk at the University of Pennsylvania, put it this way: "Everyone agrees you should be paying the risk, and that works for everyone else - but not for me. If you see your premium go up, you start calling your senators."
Lloyd Dixon, an expert on the risks of catastrophe at the Rand Corporation in Santa Monica, Calif., said that "a whole set of problems" created a financial risk for Florida, which had been subsidizing the wind insurance program for a substantial part of the state. 
"There's a significant mismatch between the risk and the assets" in the state insurance program's coffers, he said. 
Dr. Michel-Kerjan, a co-author of book "At War With The Weather: Managing Large-Scale Risks in a New Era of Catastrophes" (2009), said the book looked closely at the Florida state plan and found its finances to be as vulnerable as the state's coastlines.
"If it's a small hurricane, they've had six years without, so there are reserves" that will cover the losses, he said. "If it's a Category 3 or Category 4 hurricane, they don't have the reserves."
"We'll end up doing what we've done in the past, asking the taxpayers to bail them out," Dr. Michel-Kerjan said.

HEADLINE: A Counterculture Totem to Return as a Leaner Magazine

BYLINE: BEN SISARIO


HIGHLIGHT: The influential music magazine Arthur, which in its earlier incarnation had a circulation of 40,000 as a free publication, will return on newsprint in December at a cost of $5 an issue. 

 BODY:
From 2002 to 2008, Arthur was music's version of a literary-minded "little magazine." Distributed free in record stores and coffee shops, it celebrated underground culture of all kinds and attracted writers like Alan Moore ("Watchmen"), Douglas Rushkoff and even Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth, who wrote a reviews column with the critic Byron Coley.
Like magazines of all sizes in the digital age, however, Arthur struggled to stay in print. It briefly suspended publication, and then resumed it, in 2007 before disappearing completely the next year.
Now Arthur is back, with what its publisher and founding editor, Jay Babcock, says is a more stable business model. It will cost $5 an issue and be published on newsprint, with ads only on the back covers of its two sections, a move intended to shield the magazine from fluctuations in the economy and the ad market.
The magazine's circulation used to be around 40,000, but will be less than 10,000 for its new issue, No. 33, which comes out Dec. 22 and will feature some of its former regular writers, like Mr. Moore and Mr. Coley. Mr. Babcock also has a new publishing partner, Jason Leivian of Floating World Comics in Portland, Ore.
Whether Arthur can stay alive is another question. Dozens of music and youth-culture magazines have shut down over the last decade. This summer, the 27-year-old Spin appeared to becomethe latest casualty. After publishing its last issue in August, the magazine, now owned by a publisher of blogs and celebrity Web sites, has continued online without any announced plans for returning to print.
Mr. Babcock said that Arthur's modest but loyal following, and its freedom from the ad market, would help the magazine survive where others have not. By using newsprint instead of the higher-quality paper that advertisers prefer, and by keeping costs extremely low, Mr. Babcock said he could break even on a print run of just 1,000 copies.
"Newsprint is extremely attractive, and reader-supported is extremely attractive as opposed to ad-supported," Mr. Babcock said from Joshua Tree, Calif., where he lives "on the grid but off the pavement" in near-wilderness, he said, making compost and earning money by renting a cabin to vacationers. (Another plus, he noted, is that newsprint is compostable.)
When Arthur emerged in the early 2000s, mainstream publications were narrowing their focus and trimming articles, and niche coverage was beginning to explode on blogs and in Web publications like Pitchfork. Arthur aimed to buck both trends by printing idiosyncratic, lengthy articles on off-center music and espousing a broad idea of counterculture that harked back to the 1960s, encompassing comics, urban ecology and antiwar activism.
"We've always had the idea that if the rest of the culture was going to decline and devolve in a lowest-common-denominator thing, we were trying to be the highest common denominator," Mr. Babcock said.
The magazine earned a reputation for championing musicians like Devendra Banhart and Joanna Newsom of the so-called freak folk scene, and for an aggressive voice rarely seen in mainstream publications these days. One of its most popular articles was a combustible interview with the rock band Godsmack over its use of military imagery and support of Army recruitment.
Arthur still has only the most rudimentary Web site. Mr. Babcock said he hoped to produce an iPad-compatible version that would adequately capture the magazine's large-scale artwork and broadsheet layout.
"That'll be next year," he said.

HEADLINE: City's Unemployment Rate Dipped in October

BYLINE: PATRICK MCGEEHAN


HIGHLIGHT: The unemployment rate in New York City dropped in October but the figure does not reflect the effects of Hurricane Sandy. 

 BODY:
 Before Hurricane Sandy roared through, New York City was adding jobs and its unemployment rate was declining, the State Labor Department reported on Thursday.
 The city's unemployment rate dropped to 9.3 percent in October from 9.5 percent in September, according to the report, which does not reflect the effects the storm had on the metropolitan region's economy. The city's jobless rate is still higher than it was a year ago (9.1 percent) and significantly higher than the national rate for October (7.9 percent).
 A separate survey of employers showed that the city gained about 20,000 jobs last month, though that total was smaller than the average for October, the report said. The rise in the number of jobs in the city is not adjusted for seasonal fluctuations in hiring as the figures for the state and nation are, but it would appear less robust if it were.
 "Over all, the job market was subpar in October, with most sectors underperforming and the seasonal hiring that usually builds through the holidays largely missing," said Elena Volovelsky, an economist with the State Labor Department in Manhattan. She said the number of jobs in construction and manufacturing rose in October, a month when those industries usually cut back.
 Still, employment in the city's private sector has grown 2.9 percent in the past year, the fastest rate of any region of the state and much faster than the 1.7 percent increase in private-sector jobs in the nation since October 2011. Private-sector employment in New York State, which has kept pace with the rest of the country, increased by about 5,900 jobs last month, after seasonal adjustments, to an "all-time high" of 7.34 million, said Bohdan M. Wynnyk, deputy director of the department's Division of Research and Statistics.
 The state's unemployment rate also declined, to 8.7 percent from 8.9 percent in September. 
In New Jersey, the number of jobs shrank by about 11,700 in October, but the state's unemployment rate declined to 9.7 percent from 9.8 percent in September.

HEADLINE: John McCain's Scheduling Error

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: The Senator who wants to hold Watergate-style hearings about Benghazi missed a classified briefing about...Benghazi. 

 BODY:
Poor John McCain. The senior senator from Arizona, former presidential candidate and general Republican big-man-in-Washington was so busy on Wednesday complaining about President Obama's handling of the Benghazi mission killings that he just didn't have time to do his actual job and attend a hearing on the Benghazi mission killings.
Mr. McCain has said he wants to get to the bottom of what he seems absolutely certain was a catastrophic bungling of the Libyan situation by Mr. Obama and his team. He is proposing holding "Watergate-style" hearings on the matter, with lots of witnesses and of course, lots of television cameras.
But yesterday, when the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee received a classified briefing on the Benghazi issue, Mr. McCain was absent. His spokesman Brian Rogers blamed a "scheduling error."

Politico reported that Senator Susan Collins was a bit miffed at Mr. McCain for not showing up and said it was unnecessary to create "a brand new committee" just for Benghazi "when we already have the Senate's chief oversight committee, plus the Intelligence committee, examining this very important matter."
Slate pointed out that Mr. McCain's absence is a problem because Senate rules preclude other Senators from talking to him about the closed hearing. I'm not sure anyone is going to follow that rule, but it just underscores the risk that Mr. McCain is taking of looking buffoonish over the Benghazi killings.
Or, I should say, looking buffoonish again, because the whole thing is a reminder of how in 2008 he "suspended" his campaign against Barack Obama and dashed off to Washington during the financial meltdown. All he did was cry "emergency" and make everyone realize that no one in Washington, including in his own party, really cared what he had to say about the crisis.
Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky also missed the closed meeting on Benghazi, but managed to find the time for a TV interview in which he said he had big questions about what happened. "I don't know enough of the details," he said.

HEADLINE: Republicans in a Changing Country

BYLINE: ROSS DOUTHAT


HIGHLIGHT: Two issues where a more libertarian Republican Party would probably be a more successful party. 

 BODY:
We've had about a week's worth of recriminations and arguments about where the Republican Party goes from here, and the one theme uniting all of them is this: Whatever a given writer believed before the election correlates marvelously with their favored explanation for why Mitt Romney went down to defeat. If you were happy with the ideological situation on the right, you've probably either emphasized the practical deficiencies of the Romney campaign (his weaknesses as a candidate, his flawed turnout operation, his pollster's rose-colored glasses), or else looked for a supposed silver bullet like immigration reform to solve the Republican Party's demographic issues without touching the rest of the party platform. If you're socially conservative and populist but skeptical of Wall Street and big business, then you've probably argued the party's biggest mistake was to nominate a plutocrat and run a campaign tilted too far toward economic individualism and the interests of the rich. If you're fiscally conservative but libertarian on social issues, then you've probably made the case that Todd Akin, Richard Mourdock and anti-immigrant yahoos took the focus off the economy, and that cultural conservatives need to pipe down and let the party modernize on gay rights, immigration and abortion. If you're David Frum, who has been arguing that the party needs to be more middle class friendly and more socially liberal, then you've been claiming vindication on both counts.
My own Sunday column on the post-Romney G.O.P. belonged squarely to this "I told you so, you fools!" genre. I've believed since the mid-2000s that the Republican Party lacks a domestic policy agenda suited to the present era's challenges, and so it's not surprising that I would see a clear-as-glass connection between this hole in the party's message and Romney's underperformance with the middle income Americans whose votes put George W. Bush in the White House. At the same time, I'm pro-life, skeptical of the financial sector's influence, and doubtful about the wisdom of comprehensive immigration reform, so it's not surprising that I would find the libertarian/Wall Street Journal attempts to blame the Republican Party's problems exclusively on cultural conservatives to be deeply unconvincing. I think I'm right on all of these counts, obviously - about the policy, the politics, and the way they intertwine. But of course I would have continued to believe in my own essential correctness if Romney had eked out a narrow victory instead.
So in the spirit of breaking out of the "I told you so" box, let me offer two places where I think the post-Romney G.O.P. could improve its position by changing in ways that don't necessarily dovetail with my own preconceptions and beliefs. The first, perhaps over-obviously, is the issue of gay marriage, where my side of the argument has lost enough ground with voters to render the Republican Party's official position on the issue - and particularly the call for a never-gonna-happen constitutional amendment - an empty gesture to a now-collapsed consensus, which is likely to soon alienate more voters than it mobilizes. It's probably no longer a question of "if" but "when" the party beats a strategic retreat on the issue (I expect there will be a pro-life, pro-gay marriage Republican nominee within a generation if not sooner), and it makes a certain raw political sense to pre-emptively declare a big tent on the question, and make the party's litmus tests support for federalism rather than a Supreme Court settlement and (as Rod Dreher of the American Conservative has argued, presciently and strenuously) support for the broadest possible protections for religious liberty. I'm not sure how such a shift would affect the rate at which evangelicals and conservative Catholics turn out for Republicans - that would be the big strategic risk, obviously. But my sense is that the party would just be formally acknowledging what many religious conservatives already accept - that a political platform can't hold back a cultural tide, and that if the American understanding of what marriage is and ought to be someday turns back in a direction that cultural conservatives find congenial, the details of the Republican platform will be largely incidental to that shift.
As with gay marriage, so with marijuana. My ideal policy world would privilege other forms of criminal justice reform over the outright legalization of pot, and words cannot express how little sympathy I have for stoner culture. But when Paul Ryan implied to an interviewer that states should be free to make decisions about marijuana policy (the question was about medical marijuana, but the principle could have applied more broadly), there was no sound political reason for the Romney campaign to subsequently walk those comments back. There is still a large constituency that supports marijuana prohibition, but with crime rates down it's not an issue that has any impact on presidential elections, and national Republicans would lose very little by taking a federalist, live-and-let-live approach to measures like the ones that passed in Colorado and Washington. We have a drug policy that nobody regards as a success, and a country that's now split down the middleon whether pot should be legal for personal use. In that environment, the Republicans probably have more to gain politically from showing some flexibility on the issue - especially flexibility that can be wrapped in 10th Amendment principle - than they do from playing the law and order card and leaving it at that.
On pot and gay marriage, then, I agree with writers who think Republicans would profit politically from moving in a more libertarian direction, even if isn't the policy direction I would necessarily choose. On other questions, though - abortion, immigration, tax policy, etc. - the stereotypically libertarian view of where the G.O.P. should go from here seems like straightforward political folly. This isn't a contradiction; instead, it reflects I think is an important point for anyone involved in these kind of debates to keep in mind - namely, that voters simply aren't as ideological consistent as pundits, and so it's a grave mistake to think that political parties thrive by evolving toward a more perfect ideological consistency. For a party facing problems like the ones the G.O.P. faces now, it's not enough to just get "more libertarian" or "more populist" or "more socially conservative," without recognizing how public opinion differs from issue to issue and policy to policy. Instead, the most successful politicians go where the votes are, and let the ideological chips fall where they may.

HEADLINE: Checking Up on Your Mental Health

BYLINE: ANN CARRNS


HIGHLIGHT: Online screening tools can help you keep tabs on your emotional health. 

 BODY:
In this week's Your Money special section, I wrote about the benefits of a regular mental health checkup to help catch possible emotional problems before they spiral into something serious.
Many doctors and psychiatrists agree it's a good idea to take periodic stock of your emotional well-being. Such a checkup doesn't necessarily require a special trip to the doctor. It can be done during a regular wellness visit. Conditions like depression and anxiety are common but very treatable, especially if they are diagnosed early on before they precipitate a personal or financial crisis.
There are various online screening tools that you can use to help start a conversation with your doctor or a mental-health professional. One tool I mentioned in the story was created by a nonprofit group and is called Screening for Mental Health. It grew out of the first National Depression Screening Day, held each year in October.
As part of my reporting, I interviewed Sam Rhodes, a retired Army command sergeant major who is a 51-year-old veteran of the war in Iraq, about his experience in using such a tool. Sergeant Major Rhodes said he completed the depression questionnaire during a mental health screening event at Fort Benning, Ga., in 2007.
He said he had suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder, and had received some treatment. But after completing the questions on the form, he realized he needed more help. "I knew I was struggling, but I didn't realize how bad it was until I filled out the form," he said in a telephone interview.
He has since founded an outreach organizationto help veterans heal through horsemanship, and he travels the country speaking to service members about mental health assessments and the importance of overcoming stigma to obtain treatment. "Once you become resilient, you have to sustain it," he said.
You can try a screening tool for depression and other conditions, including anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder and eating disorders, at a Web site sponsored by Screening for Mental Health Inc.
If the results concern you, you can print out the form and discuss it with your doctor or a mental health professional. (And if you're worried that something may be wrong, you can still seek help, even if the tool doesn't raise any red flags.)
Have you tried such a tool? How do you keep tabs on your emotional well-being?

HEADLINE: WNET Mounts Campaign to Raise $150 Million

BYLINE: ELIZABETH JENSEN


HIGHLIGHT: The public television station WNET is starting a $150 million capital campaign, with part of the money going to its reserves and part going to programming. 

 BODY:
WNET, the New York City public television station that is celebrating its 50th anniversary, is beginning a capital campaign to raise $150 million. Half the money raised by the campaign, which was to be announced at WNET's annual gala Thursday, will be used to increase the station's $91.2 million endowment, said Lisa A. Mantone, vice president of development and communications. Most of the remainder will go to support the local and national programming that WNET produces, including "Great Performances" and "Nature." About $50 million has been pledged already. The station's board had been considering a campaign since 2006, before the financial crisis, which hurt many nonprofit organizations, WNET included. Ms. Mantone declined to speculate if the timing of the appeal indicated an improved economic outlook for nonprofits. "I think every institution has its moment and you work with the moment that you're in," she said, adding, "The 50th anniversary is just that moment for us."

HEADLINE: Social and Anti-Social Media

BYLINE: RICHARD PARKER


HIGHLIGHT: The very groups who made the difference in President Obama's re-election are among the fastest adopters of social and mobile media. Can Republicans catch up? 

 BODY:
On election night, it became the most re-tweeted photo in the history of social media: a picture of President Obama hugging his wife, Michelle.
But the dissemination of that iconic image is only the tip of a far larger iceberg that sank Mitt Romney. Yes, demographics helped Obama beat him. But so did the changing landscape of media consumption. The very groups - young women, Hispanics, African Americans, Asian-Americans - that made the difference are among the fastest adopters of social and mobile media. 
The Obama campaign understood and rode this convergence of demographics and media, even as Karl Rove spent $300 million on television advertising that helped garner nearly two-thirds of white males only to find himself, to his everlasting surprise, on the losing side of the national election.
Republicans may lament that this is not their father's country but more to the point this is not their father's marketing either. Irreversible change in the country's demography collided with irresistible change in the consumption of media. While older white males get their information from television the people who made the difference are on Twitter, Tumblr and smart phones generally. They may even be making decisions about politics differently than their predecessors and there will only be more of them entering the market and the electorate. 
In 2008, much of the after-action analysis of social media was of the "gee-whiz" variety - Obama outperformed McCain in this new medium! - yet the precise effect was not exactly clear, other than that it helped win over younger voters. It relied, to a large extent, on sheer volume. The Obama team out-staffed, out-emailed and simply swamped the McCain effort with dozens as many Twitter followers and 400 percent more followers on Facebook.
But the Obama effort in 2008 built more than buzz; it created conversions, according to academic research performed by Jennifer Aaker, a business professor at Stanford, along with researcher Victoria Chang. The campaign built 5 million supporters on social networks, had 2.5 million followers on Facebook, and 50 million viewers watched 14 million hours of video on YouTube, which was then pretty new. This translated into huge offline results: 230,000 events and $639 million raised from 3 million donors. On Election Day, every supporter with a mobile phone number the Obama campaign had in its database got three text message reminders to vote. Obama won by more than 8 million votes.
Of course, an exhaustive study of Obama's social media in 2012 has not yet been conducted - it's only a matter of time - but the initial reporting indicates a similar performance. The president's team, with the head-start of a huge database of supporters, just out-muscled Romney's campaign. By September 2012, Obama's Facebook page had 1.2 million likes - while Romney's had just half as much, according to Inc.'sMeaghan Ouimet. Obama had twice as many YouTube likes, comments and views as Romney -and easily 20 times as many re-tweets as the Republican nominee. Interestingly, the Obama campaign has not yet been all that eager to share its social media victory strategy, though Pro Publica is busy trying to crack the story.
The difference in content and effort created results. Women for Obama, run by the Obama team on Facebook, created a story line mixing text and graphics: It was about the rights of women, their desire to control their own health care and their voting power. Only when that narrative was engaging users did the Obama campaign make the ask, getting them to donate, call or vote. "We Vote, We Decide" was posted right before the election and the page had 1.3 million likes. On the other hand, Moms for Mitt, run by the Romney campaign, had less thematic construction, featuring photos of volunteers, images of Romney and his running mate, and posts urging the "moms" to vote or make calls. It netted just 93,000 likes.
Generally speaking, social media has not proven itself able to change someone's mind as much as it is capable of putting together communities of like-minded people. We don't know the correlation of "liking," say, on Facebook with voting behavior. But putting people together who are like-minded allows them to take other actions: to reach out to more friends online or to join old-school telephone drives and events and also to take more committed actions, like raising money. Obama raised $147 million from small donors who chipped in $200 or less, nearly three-and-a-half times as much as Romney. The barrage of constant e-mails from both campaigns also likely didn't change minds. It was just the kind of consistency - however irritating - that reminded people to donate and then to vote.
This is about more than media. The Obama campaign correctly understood that to reach certain cohorts most effectively it would have to move beyond traditional media to the media that most resonates with Hispanics, young women, African-Americans and even Asian-Americans. Consider Latinos. The 50.5 million Hispanics in the country have higher usage rates of mobile and social media than Anglos. African Americans and Hispanics have adopted Twitter at faster rates than whites or Anglos.
Consider women, too, of various ethnic backgrounds, who have embraced smart phones faster than their non-Hispanic white counterparts. More than three in five women who are of African American, Hispanic or Asian-American had a smartphone in 2011, compared to just one in three white women, according to Nielsen.
More than three in four Asian-American women believe that smartphones improve their lives, while just one in four is inclined to say the same thing about the most tried and trusted medium in American politics: Television.
The Obama campaign spent a fortune on traditional advertising, too, some of which also targeted, women and Latinos. The Democrats, though, leavened their communications spending with other media, like any smart marketer today. Which brings us to Republicans and their reliance on television. Not only did they think the demographic coalition that turned out in 2008 was a fluke, but they were preaching, through the television set, to their own choir. Less than one-in-five adults under 30 watch cable television news, according the PewResearch Center, while over half of people over 65 do.
Many of these insights are drawn from the world of market research, not political campaigns, and they're fast becoming fairly common knowledge. Market research is actively helping companies embrace, say, the $1 trillion Hispanic market, as opposed to threatening to get people to "self-deport." In business it's about addition, not subtraction. In California, Alan Zorfas, the president of the market research firm Motista, found a way to explain how President Obama - on the wrong side of so many traditional polling measures, like right-track-wrong track and the economy - was able to defy gravity. Different cohorts simply liked him, thought he was cooler or believed he truly empathized with them, regardless of his track record. "Obama is an Apple," Zorfas told me, "while Romney is a Dell."
All of this suggests not only that a key shift has long since gotten underway in demographics and media, but also that younger voters make decisions differently. They are constantly informed, messaged and reinforced by their deluge of text and Twitter messages - all coming from their friends, families and co-workers - hundreds if not thousands of times a day. While Obama lost a few points off his overall white vote, he still swamped Romney among all people under 30, the first and fastest adopters of social media, by 5 million votes (even though fewer younger voters turned out than in 2008). As if to underscore the Democratic edge, even after the polls closed in Virginia, the Obama campaign was still texting volunteers to make sure everyone in line stayed and voted.
Right now, the Republican Party is talking a lot about immigration, Marco Rubio and copying Obama's get-out-the-vote effort - all of which suggests a profound misunderstanding of what really happened in 2012 and could set the stage for a repeat in 2016.

HEADLINE: In the Early Admissions Waiting Room, Fighting Off Jitters

BYLINE: WILL WALKER


HIGHLIGHT: Will Walker, a student at University School in Hunting Valley, Ohio, is trying not to get discouraged by his pending fate in the early admissions process. 

 BODY:
A couple of weeks ago, my economics class started talking about utility, the economic term for the amount of use, benefit or happiness a consumer derives from buying a particular object. As of now, most economists measure utility in American dollars, but back in the day they used utils - abstract units of utility - to measure the amount of happiness you'd get out of a given purchase.
The more I thought about it, the more I wished that the college admissions process could be measured in utils; that instead of looking at my test scores, extracurriculars or (God forbid) my grades, colleges would decide whether to accept me based solely on how much I wanted to go there.

You see, a lot has happened to me over the past couple of weeks. For one thing, I've really started to fixate on some of the schools on my list. Williams College, for example, has become a pretty definitive No. 1. 
I always liked Williams, but I also always had reservations: I wasn't sure if I would fit in, or if I was athletic enough or if I was really ready to make that big of a commitment. But now the game has changed. Love, after all, takes time, and even though I was worried about committing early on (wedding-day jitters, so to speak), as time has passed, I've become more and more confident that it really is my top choice.
The two other schools I'm applying to early action have also risen through the ranks. For example, the University of Chicago managed to overcome a very bad first impression (party because of a rainy tour, as well as a three-hour stint in the hell on earth that is Chicago's O'Hare airport), to become one of my favorite schools. It seems like intellectualism and learning for learning's sake are alive and well at Chicago, and the more I've read about it, the more I've started to see myself there.
And my other early action school, St. John's College in Annapolis, Md., is even more unexpected. In fact, I had hardly heard of the school before I started this blog. But after vehement and relentless recommendations from their alumni (the so-called Johnnies), I took a look at the college's Web site and really started to take it seriously. I love the idea of devoting four years of my life to reading "The Great Books," to the uninterrupted study of the Western canon. To hell with employability! I want to go to college to learn as much as I can, and St. John's seems to be just the place for that.
However, despite the wide (and ever-widening) array of schools I'm becoming more comfortable with, admissions is still a big concern. My college counselor told me flat out that both Williams and the University of Chicago are huge reaches for me, meaning that my chances of getting into them are slim to none. And, to add to that concern, a hefty chunk of the colleges I'm applying to in the regular decision round are no easier to get into.
My counselors are great, and I have a number of schools on my list that I should be accepted to and would be very, very happy at. But that doesn't make it any better. Getting rejected is a tricky business, and even though I have a lot of experience with it (as any girl who knew me in middle school can attest), the thought of having admissions officers I don't know evaluating my entire high school career, and then deciding whether I'm worthy enough for their school, is pretty daunting.
That said, I'm trying as hard as I can not to get discouraged. As of now, I've turned in all of my early applications, so I can't do anything anyway; it's just a matter of playing the waiting game. And so, as long as I keep my health and my sanity until Dec. 15, I think I'll judge this first semester of senior year as a success.

HEADLINE: House Report Faults MF Global Regulators

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS and MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: The report from Congressional Republicans describes a "disorganized and haphazard" approach to oversight in the week before MF Global spun out of control. The report says the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the S.E.C. failed to coordinate as the firm was on the brink. 

 BODY:
 9:26 p.m. | Updated 
WASHINGTON - When MF Global was on the brink of collapse, chaos and confusion spread not only among the firm's executives in New York, but also among its regulators in Washington, according to a report released on Thursday.
In the final hectic hours before the brokerage firm's bankruptcy more than a year ago, regulators at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission instructed MF Global to transfer $220 million to plug a hole in customer accounts. The firm agreed - over the objections of the Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulators.
Upon learning of the futures commission's orders, the chairwoman of the S.E.C., Mary L. Schapiro, responded in an e-mail to a colleague: "Without telling us? That is unacceptable."
The e-mails of regulators, cited in an "autopsy" report from Republican members of the House Financial Services Committee's oversight panel, portray a "disorganized and haphazard" approach to oversight from an alphabet soup of federal agencies. The regulators, the Republicans said, struggled to communicate even as MF Global was reeling. 
The 100-page report, which some Democrats dismissed as a sort of public shaming of Obama administration watchdogs, further traced the MF Global debacle to the firm's top executives. Republicans placed blame on the former chief executive, Jon S. Corzine, a onetime Democratic senator and governor of New Jersey, who they said increased a bet on European debt without regard for internal controls or the danger to clients.
Rather than rein in his risk-taking, Republicans said that regulators afforded Mr. Corzine a long leash.
"We didn't need additional regulation. We needed regulators actually doing their job," Representative Randy Neugebauer, a Republican from Texas who led the investigation as chairman of the oversight panel, said at a news conference on Thursday.
Citing "an apparent inability" of the regulators to coordinate their actions, Republicans suggested that investors and customers would be better served if the S.E.C. and the futures commission streamlined their operations or combined into a single agency.
But that proposition is fraught with political peril. Lawmakers have sought to merge the two agencies for decades, only to scuttle the plans in the face of opposition. The Senate and House agriculture committees - clinging to the power and campaign donations that come with overseeing the futures commission - are often the first to object.
After the financial crisis, as lawmakers debated the Dodd-Frank regulatory overhaul, federal authorities again put forward the idea of combining the agencies. But legislators reached a bipartisan consensus that such a change would spread confusion at a time when the financial industry was barely back on its feet.
On Thursday, federal officials were skeptical of the House panel's suggestions. While some top S.E.C. and Congressional officials say they support a merger, others doubt it is politically feasible unless another crisis erupts. One Congressional aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity dismissed the House panel's recommendation as a "power grab."
In a somewhat surprising move, Republicans released the report without the support of House Democrats. On Wednesday, the oversight panel's top Democrat, Representative Michael Capuano of Massachusetts, declined to endorse the Republicans' findings, saying that while he agreed with a number of the conclusions, he needed additional time to review the document. Mr. Capuano said he would soon file an addendum to the report.
The report, the outgrowth of several Congressional hearings with MF Global's executives and other officials, is the culmination of a yearlong investigation that sought to chronicle the firm's undoing and rebuke those at fault. The House panel's findings stemmed from dozens of interviews with former employees and more than 240,000 documents.
The report leveled some of its harshest criticism on regulatory agencies, which it blamed for breakdowns in communication.
Two days before the collapse of the firm, top S.E.C. officials joked about three regulatory conference calls all being scheduled for 10 a.m. "Ahhhh, coordination in action!" Ms. Schapiro, the S.E.C., chairwoman, wrote in an e-mail. (People briefed on the matter insisted that the calls were meant to coordinate efforts among regulators on different continents regarding a number of matters.)
The House panel also noted that one senior regulator "wished" the S.E.C. would have informed other authorities about plans to impose higher capital requirements on MF Global in the early summer of 2011. A spokesman for the S.E.C., John Nester, said in a statement that the agency notified the C.F.T.C. about its plans in August, about two months after the issue first arose.
Futures commission officials declined to comment.
The report further scolded the C.F.T.C. for not informing other regulators that MF Global was using an obscure loophole to tap customer accounts. In an interview with the House panel, an S.E.C. official said the loophole allowed the firm to use its customer accounts as an "A.T.M."
The report also took aim at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Republicans argued that the New York Fed "should have exercised greater caution" when approving MF Global's application for the coveted status of selling securities on the Fed's behalf.
But much of the report's criticism was trained on Mr. Corzine, who resisted efforts to curb his authority over the European trades.
The chief executive pushed back against demands by the firm's auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers, that the company account for its sovereign debt holdings in a way that would have reduced its profitability, according to the report.
And when MF Global's chief risk officer argued that the European bet had grown too big, Mr. Corzine effectively stripped the executive of the ability to check that trade. Oversight of Mr. Corzine's trading was eventually delegated to the firm's board, which tended to support its chairman.
The panel's report also suggested that MF Global executives painted a darker picture of the firm's health in private. Despite assuring investors during a public earnings call in late October that executives "feel good" about the brokerage firm's finances, one executive described a major unit as being "currently unable to fund itself" in an internal e-mail.
No one at MF Global has been accused of wrongdoing.
While lacking a full bipartisan endorsement, the document is the most significant government effort yet to address MF Global's errors.
Authorities investigating MF Global's collapse are leery of filing criminal charges against the top executives, suspecting that chaos and lax controls - not criminality - resulted in customer money going missing. And while regulators are still pursuing civil enforcement actions, in which the burden of proof is less, officials have not yet decided to act.
MF Global's customers remain in the lurch. Farmers and ranchers, who traded futures contracts through MF Global to protect themselves from the price swings of their crops, have recovered about 82 percent of their money but are still owed millions of dollars.
James W. Giddens, the court-appointed trustee seeking to recover $1.6 billion for MF Global's customers, has joined a lawsuit against several top MF Global executives, including Mr. Corzine.
"Please do not get the impression that these people will be made whole," said Spencer Bachus, an Alabama Republican who oversees the full House financial committee. "These are real people. This is not just a number."

HEADLINE: With Economy Still Trumping Emissions, Obama Plans an Education Push on Climate

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: As he plans a climate education push, President Obama says emission plans still have to mesh with economic priorities. 

 BODY:
In case you missed President Obama's first long discussion of human-driven global warming in recent memory, which came near the end of his news conference on Wednesday, here's the brunt of it, as summarized on Twitter by Will Oremus of Slate (found via Stephen Lacey):
Here is Obama on climate change, in four short sentences.
- Will Oremus (@WillOremus)14 Nov 12
1) Climate change is real.
- Will Oremus (@WillOremus)14 Nov 12
2) We have an obligation to future generations to do something about it.
- Will Oremus (@WillOremus)14 Nov 12
3) Doing something about it will require tough political choices.
- Will Oremus (@WillOremus)14 Nov 12
4) I'm not willing to make those tough political choices.
- Will Oremus (@WillOremus)14 Nov 12
The president actually did say quite a bit, which you can read in the transcript excerpt below. Among other things, he offered a sobering reality check in the face of a big, and largely wishful, push for a carbon tax as a budget fix. 
Perhaps President Obama thought he could win points for sincerity by pledging in coming months to have "a wide-ranging conversation with scientists, engineers and elected officials to find out what can - what more can we do to make short-term progress in reducing carbons [sic]."
It's certainly not the first time this has been done. Have a look back at my coverage from 2001 of President George W. Bush's month-long series of briefings by climate scientists, including James E. Hansen of NASA, for the full Bush cabinet, including Vice President Dick Cheney. 
To get a sense of the tutorials they received, click here to review the marvelous hand-drawn slides presented at the White House (and in various hearings) by Daniel Albritton, then a top government climate scientist. They are a model of clear science communication. Here's one snippet: 
Mr. Albritton's findings demonstrate that the climate basics have been the same for a very long time. There are some shifts in understanding -- on Arctic sea ice, for example. But for aspects of greenhouse-driven global warming that are most relevant to society, uncertainty -- while no reason to relax -- remains deep and durable. 
I was happy to see Mr. Obama describe "an education process that I think is necessary, a discussion, the conversation across the country about, you know, what realistically can we do long term to make sure that this is not something we're passing on to future generations that's going to be very expensive and very painful to deal with." 
I hope that takes the form of an energy and climate "listening tour," as I proposed early in 2011 -- with the listening aimed at identifying the many points of agreement on energy efficiency and innovation that get lost in fights over global warming. Click through the three slides below to see how the wide differences over carbon policy evaporate when the discussion is about policies that foster thriftier use of energy or non-polluting sources: 
Energy Agreement Hidden by Climate Disputes from Andrew Revkin
It's data like these that prompted me awhile back to conclude, "If I had to choose one of two bumper stickers for our car - CLIMATE CRISIS or ENERGY QUEST -I'd choose the latter."
Here's the relevant portion of the Obama news conference transcript:
 Q. 
 [Mark Landers] Thank you, Mr. President. In his endorsement of you a few weeks ago, Mayor Bloomberg said he was motivated by the belief that you would do more to confront the threat of climate change than your opponent. Tomorrow you're going up to New York City, where you're going to, I assume, see people who are still suffering the effects of Hurricane Sandy, which many people say is further evidence of how a warming globe is changing our weather. What specifically do you plan to do in a second term to tackle the issue of climate change? And do you think the political will exists in Washington to pass legislation that could include some kind of a tax on carbon?
 A. 
You know, as you know, Mark, we can't attribute any particular weather event to climate change. What we do know is the temperature around the globe is increasing faster than was predicted even 10 years ago. We do know that the Arctic ice cap is melting faster than was predicted even five years ago. We do know that there have been extraordinarily - there have been an extraordinarily large number of severe weather events here in North America, but also around the globe.
And I am a firm believer that climate change is real, that it is impacted by human behavior and carbon emissions. And as a consequence, I think we've got an obligation to future generations to do something about it.
Now, in my first term, we doubled fuel efficiency standards on cars and trucks. That will have an impact. That will a lot of carbon out of the atmosphere. We doubled the production of clean energy, which promises to reduce the utilization of fossil fuels for power generation. And we continue to invest in potential breakthrough technologies that could further remove carbon from our atmosphere.
But we haven't done as much as we need to. So what I'm going to be doing over the next several weeks, next several months, is having a conversation, a wide-ranging conversation with scientists, engineers and elected officials to find out what can - what more can we do to make short-term progress in reducing carbons, and then working through an education process that I think is necessary, a discussion, the conversation across the country about, you know, what realistically can we do long term to make sure that this is not something we're passing on to future generations that's going to be very expensive and very painful to deal with.
I don't know what - what either Democrats or Republicans are prepared to do at this point, because, you know, this is one of those issues that's not just a partisan issue. I also think there's - there are regional differences. There's no doubt that for us to take on climate change in a serious way would involve making some tough political choices, and you know, understandably, I think the American people right now have been so focused and will continue to be focused on our economy and jobs and growth that, you know, if the message is somehow we're going to ignore jobs and growth simply to address climate change, I don't think anybody's going to go for that.
I won't go for that.
If, on the other hand, we can shape an agenda that says we can create jobs, advance growth and make a serious dent in climate change and be an international leader, I think that's something that the American people would support.
So you know, you can expect that you'll hear more from me in the coming months and years about how we can shape an agenda that garners bipartisan support and helps move this - moves this agenda forward.
 Q. 
 It sounds like you're saying, though - (off mic) - probably still short of a consensus on some kind of - (off mic).
 A. 
 I - that I'm pretty certain of. And look, we're - we're still trying to debate whether we can just make sure that middle-class families don't get a tax hike. Let's see if we can resolve that. That should be easy. This one's hard. But it's important because, you know, one of the things that we don't always factor in are the costs involved in these natural disasters. We'd - we just put them off as - as something that's unconnected to our behavior right now, and I think what, based on the evidence, we're seeing is - is that what we do now is going to have an impact and a cost down the road if - if - if we don't do something about it.

MY husband looks more like Cary Grant in ''Operation Petticoat'' every day -- accomplished, senior and ravishingly handsome. Ordinarily, this would not be a problem for me. Ordinarily, this Cary Grantness would be cause for a skip in my step and a naughty gleam in my eye.
But this is not an ordinary week for military marriages. This is a week in which heroes are brought down by their all-too-human flaws. This is a week of women who look like Kardashians turning over their e-mail accounts to the F.B.I. This is a week of military spouses -- male and female -- being hand-fed humiliation by the person whose career ambitions they supported for years. 
Most of the time, my long-married military friends and I don't think about infidelity. We don't worry about divorce. We know that research from the RAND Corporation shows that even though military members are more likely to be married at every age than their matched civilian counterparts, we are no more likely to be divorced. We feel confident that despite war and danger and the escapades of our own children, our marriages are forever.
Until now. Because Gen. David H. Petraeus is no drunken ship captain carousing in Russia with his junior officers. General Petraeus is no wolf preying on females in his chain of command. He seems too much like our own husbands. If he could betray his wife of 38 years and 23 moves and a decade of constant war, what hope do the rest of us have for fidelity?
This weekend I treated my husband to the same scene that probably played out in the bedrooms of all 800,000 active-duty marriages. Ours was crowned with me stomping out of the tub clad in a towel and crying, ''Please, please, promise me that won't ever happen to us!''
My husband of 25 years thought this was the silliest thing I have ever said. And I have said a lot about infidelity through our own history of 7 deployments, 16 moves and 2 so-called geographic bachelor tours, when he was sent on assignment without us.
I don't mean that either of us has jealous tantrums or that either of us is a cheater. I mean that when military life requires that you spend so much time apart, your marriage confronts one of the factors shown to contribute to infidelity: opportunity.
When we were first married, the opportunity was all mine. My husband was stationed on an all-male ship in the middle of the Persian Gulf. I was a 22-year-old girl who thought it was ''no biggie'' to go dancing with a bunch of naval aviators. ''It was just dancing,'' I claimed. ''What are you so mad about?''
Later, the opportunity was all his. I was home with a baby and no friends, and he was making port visits. One night he woke me up with a call from a 7-Eleven in Daytona Beach, Fla. ''Some girl was flirting with me a little too much,'' he said. ''I thought I should go get a Klondike bar instead.''
Although there are no firm numbers about infidelity and the military, I suspect that we are a lot like other Americans. From my experience as a military marriage consultant, I'd estimate that a third of military marriages are probably blighted by infidelity -- about the same as civilian marriages.
And so we set up our little rules and policies to keep our marriage safe. We talk. We identify the rare, much-too-attractive individuals in our work and social circles whom we need to keep at arm's length. Fidelity is ingrained in us now.
So why has the Petraeus scandal reduced me to a wet towel and tears? I watched the Petraeuses on TV and noted that, like my husband, the general is in that Cary Grant stage of a military career.
I watch them and I am suddenly aware I look less like the buxom nurse in ''Operation Petticoat'' and more like Mr. Grant's co-star, Tony Curtis, every day. And not the young Tony Curtis, either.
Meanwhile, early next year my husband will deploy for the eighth time. So, not surprisingly, all I can think as I watch the Petraeus scandal unfold is: The Kardashians are coming. The Kardashians are coming.
What are our meager defenses against age and distance and opportunity? We talk about the Petraeuses as if we know them; we don't, personally, but in a way we know their life story intimately. And now we know, as they do, that history isn't enough to keep a long military marriage together.
No, I think we always knew it. It is just that now we have a reason to look at this new fidelity and make our plans for the deployments to come.
We reassure each other. We discuss strategy. We laugh over our shared past. We head back to bed.

HEADLINE: A Formerly Button-Down Brand Loosens Up

BYLINE: By ANDREW ADAM NEWMAN

 BODY:
WITH so many young men spending their college years shuffling to class in pajama bottoms and sweatshirts, it should come as no surprise that they are largely ambivalent about fashion.
Only 29 percent of men agree with the statement ''I like to keep up with the latest trends in fashion,'' according to a survey of men 18 and older conducted by Mintel, a market research firm. What men most want from clothing has little to do with appearance; 85 percent agree with the statement, ''I dress for comfort.''
Now Van Heusen, the 91-year-old clothing brand, is stepping up its efforts to use a different entry point -- football -- as a way to get young men interested in style. 
A broad marketing effort called the Van Heusen Institute of Style features Steve Young and Jerry Rice, both Hall of Fame members, and Matthew Stafford, the current Detroit Lions quarterback, as guides to help men make the transition, in the words of the campaign, from ''schlub to swagger.''
The average age of a Van Heusen consumer is 39, the company says, but the campaign is being pitched to younger men from 18 to 34.
The Van Heusen Web site and Facebook page have been transformed into an extended football metaphor. Fashion spreads featuring the players are called ''playbooks'' and feature gridiron lingo: one featuring fitted shirts is called ''First and Fitted''; another with colorful shirts is called ''Friday Night Brights.'' First introduced in 2010, the newest iteration of the Institute of Style campaign is a collaboration between Van Heusen and Funny or Die, the comedy Web site. In a new online video produced by Funny or Die, Pete (played by comedian Rob Lathan) is about to meet with a banker for a small-business loan dressed in a hoodie, shorts, white socks and sandals.
Mr. Young and Mr. Rice, who are watching on a monitor in a van, stakeout-style, direct Mr. Stafford, who wears an earpiece, to scoop up Pete so they can dress him more suitably.
In the video, whose humor is in the over-the-top style of ''Airplane'' and ''Police Squad,'' Mr. Stafford takes Pete to a department store, where the quarterback runs through the men's department knocking over mannequins as if scrambling for a first down.
The three-minute video, which concludes, naturally, with Pete looking dapper in Van Heusen clothes and getting the loan, will appear Sunday on Funny or Die and on the Van Heusen Web site and Facebook page.
Also on Sunday, during NBC's ''Sunday Night Football,'' a 30-second commercial in the form of a trailer for the video will direct viewers to the Van Heusen Web site.
Van Heusen, a PVH Corporation brand, declined to reveal expenditures for the campaign, which also includes print advertising in GQ, Men's Health and ESPN The Magazine. The brand spent $6.8 million on advertising in 2011, according to the Kantar Media unit of WPP.
Michael Kelly, executive vice president for marketing at PVH, said that Van Heusen took a fashion-intervention approach because men are in a sorry sartorial state.
''Men have sunken to an almost all-time low,'' Mr. Kelly said. ''Kids can get away with T-shirts and sweat pants in school, but the dress code allowed on campus is not the dress code allowed on Madison Avenue or Wall Street.''
In the age range of men the brand is pitching to, Mr. Kelly said that the ideal consumer is ''a 26-year-old fan who is influenced by professional sports, and who is finding his way after leaving college.'' Such fans, he added, are ''getting their fashion cues from what they see athletes wearing postgame -- on the sports runways, if you will.''
Marshal Cohen, chief industry analyst at the NPD Group, a market research firm, said that while young men entering the work force today might admire the Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, they should think twice about emulating his hoodie-and-jeans wardrobe.
''Just a few years ago, you could go to work in your pajamas, and if you looked like you just rolled out of bed when you went to work, that meant you had the technological savvy to change the world,'' Mr. Cohen said.
During the economic downturn, he said, applicants cannot afford to go to a job interview dressed sloppily.
Mr. Cohen lauded the Van Heusen strategy of using athletes whom many young men admire to prod them to dress more professionally.
Like its shirts, advertising for Van Heusen traditionally has been buttoned up, featuring Ronald Reagan and celebrities like Bob Hope and Jimmy Stewart. Charging Funny or Die with creating a humorous video that highlights Van Heusen but without an overt sales pitch is a departure for the brand.
''Once you move into the social space, you have to begin to give up control of the brand a bit, and if you're not willing to do that, you can't reach this new demographic,'' Mr. Kelly, the brand marketer, said. ''Writing messaging that's edgy is a bit of a scary place.''
Founded by Will Ferrell, Adam McKay and Chris Henchy, Funny or Die draws about 19 million unique users a month, who on average watch between two and three videos per visit, according to the Web site.
Mr. Kelly was so impressed with the video that he decided to promote it with the commercial on Sunday, which had not been the original plan. But he noted that its humor did not resonate with all his colleagues.
''I reminded the old guys in the company when they were looking at this, 'This is not targeted at you, so I really don't care if you like it,' '' Mr. Kelly said. ''There's a little bit of that 'Saturday Night Live' funniness, that you get it, or you don't.''

Museums
Asia Society and Museum: 'Bound Unbound: Lin Tianmiao' (through Jan. 27) Lin Tianmiao is one of a rare kind in China, where she lives: a nationally and internationally renowned female artist. This museumwide show presents installations that have not been widely seen. Influenced by American artists like Kiki Smith, Louise Bourgeois and Ann Hamilton -- who made the female body and traditional women's occupations hot topics during the 1990s when Ms. Lin was living in New York -- these productions are not particularly original. But they are striking for their surrealistic theatricality and labor intensive craft. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 517-2742, asiasociety.org. (Ken Johnson) 
Brooklyn Museum: 'Jean-Michel Othoniel: My Way' (through Dec. 2) Some of the art in this whimsical but cloying midcareer survey can strike you as the sculptural equivalent of haute couture. A bed framed by Murano glass beads is accompanied by veils of tulle, each one hand embroidered with gold thread in a workshop established by Louis XIV. Elsewhere, 4,200 yellow blown-glass bricks, shaped by artisans from Firozabad, India, form a shimmering rectangular solid. Early works in wax, sulfur and obsidian are more personal and provocative, showing the influence of mentors and peers like Felix Gonzalez-Torres, Robert Gober, Sophie Calle and Annette Messager. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Karen Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Brooklyn Museum: 'Mickalene Thomas: Origin of the Universe' (through Jan. 20) This invigorating exhibition is dominated by big, brash collagelike paintings, thick with color and studded with rhinestones that depict cacophonous landscapes, spatially skewed interiors and, best of all, images of imperious black women among swaths of brightly patterned fabrics. Building on Conceptual identity art, borrowing from art history and 1970s blaxploitation extravagance, they subvert prevailing notions of beauty and taste and subvert the male gaze while offering resounding proof that the political, not only the personal, can also be stunningly pictorial. Bravo. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith)
&#x2605; Brooklyn Museum: 'Materializing ''Six Years'': Lucy R. Lippard and the Emergence of Conceptual Art' (through Feb. 3) This big, intellectually enthralling exhibition of Conceptual works from the 1960s and early '70s is not a conventional museum period survey. Rather, it approximates how the rise of Conceptualism was seen while it was happening by one person: the curator, critic and writer Lucy R. Lippard, who was an extraordinarily energetic participant in and promoter of a trend that brought us the triumph of mind over matter in art. Anyone who wants art to be radically defiant of the market-driven system must see it. 200 Eastern Parkway, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; El Museo del Barrio: 'Caribbean: Crossroads of the World' (through Jan. 6) In size, cultural scope and freshness of material, the three-museum exhibition ''Caribbean: Crossroads of the World'' is a big art event in New York City, itself one of the largest Caribbean cities in the world. Be warned: the thematically arranged show throws you into history at the deep end. Almost all the information is strictly visual; there are very few explanatory labels anywhere. But the visuals are so rich, and interact so provocatively, that you may well be inspired to go out and do some homework and come back for a second look. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem, (212) 831-7272, elmuseo.org; Also on display at Queens Museum of Art, New York City Building, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, Queens, (718) 592-9700, queensmuseum.org. (Holland Cotter)
&#x2605; Frick Collection: 'Mantegna to Matisse: Master Drawings From the Courtauld Gallery' (through Jan. 27) This show of 58 drawings from a London museum and institute of art history covers a lot of ground -- namely, the Renaissance, Baroque and Modern periods. The installation, which spills over from the lower-level galleries into the Cabinet Room off the lobby, encourages much back-and-forth between works of similar subject or virtuosity; Pontormo is paired with Michelangelo, Rubens with Rembrandt, and Goya with Daumier. 1 East 70th Street, Manhattan, (212) 288-0700, frick.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Frick Collection: 'Vincent van Gogh's Portrait of a Peasant (Patience Escalier)' (through Jan. 20) ''You'll shortly make the acquaintance of Mr. Patience Escalier -- a sort of man with a hoe, an old Camargue oxherd,'' Vincent van Gogh wrote to his brother, Theo, from the Provenal city of Arles in 1888. His bracingly vivid portrait the same year of this local character, with his grizzled beard and steely blue eyes offset by a ruddy complexion and bright yellow hat, normally resides at the Norton Simon Museum in Pasadena, Calif. But for the next few months it can be seen at the Frick as part of an exchange program between the two museums. Installed on a temporary wall in the Oval Room, it shocks the neighboring Whistler portraits with its feral gaze and forthright celebration of hard labor. 1 East 70th Street, Manhattan, (212) 288-0700, frick.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Guggenheim Museum: 'Picasso Black and White' (through Jan. 23) Billed as the first monochromatic look at Picasso's whole career, this exhibition is as eye-opening as it is elegant. That's especially true among the later works on the upper ramps, which push well past the obligatory Neo-Classicism and Analytic Cubism into bracingly sensual explorations of the figure, strident political cries de coeur  la Guernica, and winking homages to Delacroix and Velzquez. Also notable: Thirty eight of the show's 118 works have never been exhibited in this country, and 5, among them the sharply angular ''Bust of a Woman With a Hat'' (1939), have never been on view publicly. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; International Center of Photography: 'Rise and Fall of Apartheid: Photography and Bureaucracy of Everyday Life' (through Jan. 6) With more than 500 photographs -- supplemented by books, magazines, posters and films -- spread over two floors, this show documenting institutionalized racism in South Africa from 1948 to the election of Nelson Mandela in 1994 can't help being overwhelming. But it's pitched as much to the mind, as to the heart. On the one hand, it's a grand narrative of stirring sights: ardent faces, agitated bodies, camaraderie, clenched fists, funerals. It's also a disquisition on the ordinariness of goodness and evil, on how people in a particular time and place encounter and partake of both, and go on with their lives. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Japan Society: 'Silver Wind: The Arts of Sakai Hoitsu (1761-1828)' (through Jan. 6) Have any artists ever, anywhere, caught the hello-ness of spring and the farewell-ness of autumn more sweetly and sharply than the Rimpa painters of Japan? Two shimmering fall exhibitions -- this show is running in conjunction with ''Designing Nature: The Rinpa Aesthetic in Japanese Art'' at the Metropolitan Museum of Art -- argue persuasively, that no, no artists ever have. Together the exhibitions add up to one of the largest Rimpa displays seen outside of Japan in years, with Japan Society's show giving us a more concentrated view of the style. 333 East 47th Street, Manhattan, (212) 715-1258, japansociety.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Bernini: Sculpting in Clay' (through Jan. 6) Gian Lorenzo Bernini, one of the great marble sculptors of all time, never made an artwork in clay as a finished piece. He did, however, use clay to work out his ideas, and he probably produced thousands of studies in that generously plastic material. But today only 52 pieces in clay are known to have been made by him, and this revealing exhibition presents 39 of them. They range from small, quickly made sketches of angels and other beings that today look surprisingly modern to an amazing, half-size lion pausing to drink from an invisible pool. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Designing Nature: The Rinpa Aesthetic in Japanese Art' (through Jan. 13) Have any artists ever, anywhere, caught the hello-ness of spring and the farewell-ness of autumn more sweetly and sharply than the Rimpa painters of Japan? Two shimmering fall exhibitions -- this show is running in conjunction with ''Silver Wind: The Arts of Sakai Hoitsu (1761-1828)'' at Japan Society -- argue persuasively, that no, no artists ever have. Together the exhibitions add up to one of the largest Rimpa displays seen outside of Japan in years, with the Met's show giving us a broader view of the style. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Extravagant Inventions: The Princely Furniture of the Roentgens' (through Jan. 27) The first in-depth survey of the brilliant artistry and engineering of Abraham and David Roentgen, a father-and-son team of genius German cabinetmakers, features roll-top desks, writing tables, chairs and clocks. Rife with intricate inlay and marquetry, gilded mounts and hidden compartments revealed by the touch of a button, these objects were among the supreme status symbols of late-18th-century Europe. Video animations show seven of the desks in action. The show is, over all, a stealth blockbuster. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Faking It: Manipulated Photography Before Photoshop' (through Jan. 27) This absorbing, often amusing exhibition offers abundant evidence that photographers have been cheating since shortly after the medium's invention almost two centuries ago. It features prints dating from 1846 to the early '90s made from altered negatives; seemingly realistic images made by piecing together two or more negatives; hand-colored black-and-white prints; Surrealistic montages; and conceptual confections contesting the ideal of photographic truth. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Regarding Warhol: Sixty Artists, Fifty Years' (through Dec. 31) The Met's latest foray into recent art will undoubtedly be a crowd-pleaser, not the least for the mini-Warhol retrospective of 50 works that forms its spine. But with 100 often significant works by 59 other relentlessly predictable artists -- including Gerhard Richter, Cindy Sherman and Jeff Koons -- it is largely a shapeless, enthusiastic muddle. A dismaying return to the great-man, ber-artist approach to art history, it does little to diminish the perception that where new art is concerned, the Met has a very long way to go. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Chinese Gardens: Pavilions, Studios, Retreats' (through Jan. 6) To anyone strolling through the Chinese painting galleries at the Met, the whole world will look like a garden of infinite expansion. That's the impression given by the 80 paintings and objects that make up this fragrant exhibition, drawn entirely from the museum's deep holdings, about paradises lost and found; about nature blooming and fading; about cosmological events transpiring in backyard bamboo groves. Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)
MoMA PS1: 'Now Dig This! Art & Black Los Angeles 1960-1980' (through March 11) This exhibition of works by black artists who lived and worked in Los Angeles during a time of revolutionary changes happening in art and society had its debut at the Hammer Museum last year as part of the citywide extravaganza ''Pacific Standard Time: Art in L.A. 1945-1980.'' Focusing mainly on assemblage, the show includes pieces by Melvin Edwards, Betye Saar, David Hammons and nearly 30 others. It contributes a valuable chapter to the American art history of the last 50 years. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Johnson)
Morgan Library and Museum: 'Durer to de Kooning: 100 Master Drawings From Munich' (through Jan. 6) A few years ago the Morgan lent a cache of drawings to the Staatliche Graphische Sammlung in Munich. Now it's payback time, and 100 choice drawings from that venerable German museum are in New York. Mantegna, Michelangelo and Raphael are among the serious marquee names, nicely balanced with cartoon heads by Sigmar Polke. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 686-0008, themorgan.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Museum of Arts and Design: 'Doris Duke's Shangri-La: Architecture, Landscape and Islamic Art' (through Feb. 17) The Honolulu estate known as Shangri La is a masterpiece of refined eclecticism. Doris Duke, the owner, referred to it as a ''Spanish-Moorish-Persian-Indian complex.'' Whatever you call it, it looks magnificent in this show and the accompanying book. Both combine sparkling new color shots of the home and gardens taken by Tim Street-Porter; architectural documents and vintage photographs; pieces of the collection; and projects by contemporary artists who had residencies at Shangri La (which has served, since Duke's death in 1993, as the Doris Duke Foundation for Islamic Art). 2 Columbus Circle, Manhattan, (212) 299-7777, madmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Museum of Modern Art: 'Born Out of Necessity' (through Jan. 28) The title may or may not have an extra preposition, but the show itself is a fascinating array of recent acquisitions that have a fairly direct bearing on quality of life or actual survival. They range from classic (the 1908 Dixie cup) to cutting edge; cover both analog and digital; and include the tiny (the latest in earplugs) and the quite large (the 1952 United States Army Jeep). Whether born ''of'' or ''out of'' necessity, the displays attest to human ingenuity responding to human need. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; Museum of Modern Art: 'Edvard Munch: The Scream' (through April 29) A version of Edvard Munch's ''Scream'' is on view at this museum for the next six months, having come almost straight from the auction block. Protected by a Plexiglas box, like the Mona Lisa, it has been given a prominent perch opposite van Gogh's ''Starry Night'' in the fifth-floor painting and sculpture galleries. There is talk of timed tickets. But if you can put up with all the pageantry, you'll have a rare chance to get acquainted with ''The Scream'' in person and in context. The museum has built a mini-exhibition around the work, surrounding it with Munch paintings and prints that amplify its motifs and mood. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Museum of Modern Art: 'Quay Brothers: On Deciphering the Pharmacist's Prescription for Lip-Reading Puppets' (through Jan. 7) The first major museum retrospective devoted to the strange puppet-haunted universe unleashed in the Quay Brothers' stop-action film animations includes their magical miniature stage sets, a sizable sampling of drawings, prints, collages and early illustration designs as well as works by artists who influenced them. More than 30 years of animated and live-action shorts, television commercials, music videos and imaginative documentaries in particular allow devotees and neophytes alike to grasp the essence of Timothy and Stephen Quay's achievement and its evolution, strengths and weaknesses all. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; Museum of Modern Art: 'Alina Szapocznikow: Sculpture Undone, 1955-1972' (through Jan. 28) This small but intense exhibition is the museum's second show of an Eastern European female artist in less than a year, following the Conceptual performance and photography of ''Sanja Ivekovic: Sweet Violence.'' For many Americans it will be their first look at Ms. Szapocznikow's precocious Pop-Surrealist sculpture, much of which parallels work made on these shores by Lynda Benglis, Eva Hesse and Hannah Wilke. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Rosenberg)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Performing Histories (1)' (through March 11) An awareness of the uprisings, protests, occupations and revolutions erupting around the globe is present in ''Performing Histories (1),'' a show of video, film and photographic work recently acquired by MoMA. Insurrection and resistance pervade the Romanian artist Ion Grigorescu's film ''Dialogue With Ceausescu'' (1978), while the feminist personal as political is employed in Martha Rosler's ''She Sees in Herself a New Woman Every Day'' (1976) and Sharon Hayes's four-channel video ''The Interpreter Project'' (2001). Andrea Fraser's two videos connect politics and the museum. In one she describes how scientific philanthropy in the 19th century directed wealth to museums and other public institutions rather than the poor, while another video delves into how MoMA itself interacted with revolutionaries and communists, like the Mexican muralist Diego Rivera. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Martha Schwendener)
Museum of the City of New York: 'London Street Photography' (through Dec. 2) Arriving from the Museum of London, which presented it in 2010 and owns the more than 150 works on view, this exhibition affords those of us watching the Olympics on TV a glimpse of an older, more eccentric city. It covers the Victorian era to the present, and is particularly rich in images from the mid-20th century. A smaller companion exhibition, ''City Scenes: Highlights of New York Street Photography,'' provides an opportunity to compare and contrast two very different modern cities as they grappled with war, the postindustrial era and various forms of social tension. Fifth Avenue at 103rd Street, (212) 534-1672, mcny.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Neue Galerie: 'Ferdinand Hodler: View to Infinity' (through Jan. 7) Near the end of this exhibition you come to a small, chapel-like room containing a painting from 1915 of Ferdinand Hodler's longtime model and lover Valentine God-Darel on her deathbed; three small, vibrantly colored landscapes; and a self-portrait. Thus ring the basic themes that unfold in this extraordinarily touching show of late works by the Swiss Symbolist: Self, Other, Love, Death and World. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; New Museum: 'Rosemarie Trockel: A Cosmos' (through Jan. 20) This elegant, mind-expanding exhibition sidesteps the standard retrospective format and a linear, canonical version of art history. Ms. Trockel emphasizes her recent work in numerous mediums -- most impressively ceramics, photography and drawing, sharing the spotlight with outsider artists, botanical illustrations and zoological models and even natural specimens. The result is completely entrancing, a celebration of nature and also of human nature -- its curiosity, ingenuity and yearning for expression -- encapsulated by the artist's magnanimous vision. 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side, (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Smith)
New-York Historical Society: 'John Rogers: American Stories' (through Feb. 18) The sculptor John Rogers (1829-1904) was the Norman Rockwell of his time. For a few decades following the Civil War, his lively, anecdotal, figurative tableaus known as Rogers Groups sold by the tens of thousands to middle- and upper-middle-class folks for about $15 apiece. Including examples of the technically impressive bronze masters from which the multiples were cast in plaster, this exhibition showcases an artist who was as remarkable for his entrepreneurial savvy as for his idealistic vision of life in America. 170 Central Park West, at 77th Street, (212) 873-3400, nyhistory.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Rubin Museum of Art: 'Candid: The Lens and Life of Homai Vyarawalla' (through Jan. 14) The Indian photojournalist Homai Vyarawalla (1913-2012) was on the spot time and again to record the history of modern South Asia being made. This small, evocative, event-filled retrospective catches highlights of her career, including her coverage of Mohandas Gandhi's funeral; important events in the career of the charismatic Jawaharlal Nehru; and visits from Nikita Khrushchev, Ho Chi Minh and Jacqueline Kennedy. As one of the few female photographers in the Indian press corps in her day, Ms. Vyarawalla was a pioneer; in 1970 she abruptly put down her camera and disappeared until her recent rediscovery by younger peers. 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212) 620-5000, rmanyc.org. (Cotter)
Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Richard Artschwager!' (through Feb. 3) Mr. Artschwager had his first career retrospective at the Whitney Museum in 1988, and now, at 88, he is having his second. Much of the work -- the furniturelike sculptures covered with wood-grain Formica and the paintings that appeared to be done with smudged soot -- are familiar. His recent portraits of George W. Bush and Osama bin Laden, and his high-color landscapes of the American Southwest are not. An installation of his famous ''blps'' (pronounced blips), abstract lozenge forms, usually black and shaped like the uprights in an exclamation point, is in place on and around the High Line near the site of the Whitney's future home at Gansevoort and Washington Streets. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Wade Guyton: OS' (through Jan. 13) Something of a rarity this fall season, a beautiful, thoughtfully staged show makes a cogent case for a young painter with no overt political ax to grind working in New York. Made entirely with computer, scanner and printer -- the OS refers to computer operating systems -- his works methodically explore the possibilities of technology as just another if especially up-to-date paintbrush. The results are full of glitches and irregularities that provide their own pictorial life, full of the ghosts of painting past and strikingly original. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Smith)
Galleries: Uptown
Jean Arp: 'A Collection of Wood Reliefs and Collages' (through Dec. 11) Centered on a late print project, this show finds Arp sticking to his early-Modernist vocabulary of floating, biomorphic shapes. The focus is a set of colored-paper collages and a matching series of painted-wood reliefs, the bookends to a 1966 album of woodcuts titled ''Le Soleil Recercl.'' The show's theme of continuity across mediums is defied, brilliantly, by two late-1950s works in brass; their spiky points show Arp's friendly blobs evolving into something more specific to the material at hand. Blain/Di Donna, 981 Madison Avenue, between 76th and 77th Streets, (212) 259-0444, blaindidonna.com. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; 'Calder: The Complete Bronzes' (through Dec. 8) The ingenious master of spare, levitating modern sculpture in wire, wood and sheet metal turns out to have been almost as adept with the ancient dead-weight staple of bronze, as demonstrated by 35 examples and some dozen plaster models in this eye-opening show. They run the gamut from figurative to abstract; dabble in Surrealism; achieve their own kind of levitation; and delve into art history while enabling the artist to use his hands and amazing tactile sense in a different way. L&M Arts, 45 East 78th Street, Manhattan, (212) 861-0020, lmgallery.com. (Smith)
&#x2605; 'Echoes of the Past: The Buddhist Cave Temples of Xiangtangshan' (through Jan. 6) In the Buddhist way of thinking, all things must pass, though that seems a shame if they're as out-of-this-world beautiful as Chinese Buddhist art is. But could that vision of transience be changing in the 21st century, as still-crude technology lets images live on out there in digital clouds? Regret and hope alike run through this multifaceted show that presents a dozen gorgeous sixth-century sculptures and a digital simulation of the cave temple in China from which some of them were long ago removed. Institute for the Study of the Ancient World, 15 East 84th Street, Manhattan, (212) 992-7800, isaw.nyu.edu. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Wayne Thiebaud: 'A Retrospective' (through Nov. 30) This concise survey of the art of Mr. Thiebaud, one of the greatest living American painters, includes a surprising number of objects drawn from his personal holdings and dating from every stage of his six-decade career. Among them are many of the medium-size still lifes of food that made Mr. Thiebaud famous, paintings like 1963's ''Peppermint Counter,'' with its inviting piles of red-and-white candies, as well as singular and surprising works like the small 1967 painting of an American flag hanging from a schoolhouse wall. Acquavella Galleries, 18 East 79th Street, Manhattan, (212) 734-6300, acquavellagalleries.com. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Cy Twombly: 'The Last Paintings' and 'A Survey of Photographs, 1954-2011' (through Dec. 22) Side-by-side exhibitions -- one of a series of brash final paintings with thick scrolling, spiraling scrawls in red and yellow on vivid green grounds, the other of overly lush, often sentimental photographs -- offer an admirably complete view of the sensibility of Cy Twombly, who died last year at 83. Together they show the artist as close to his best and unquestionably his worst. Luckily, he spent much more time working with a paintbrush than with a camera. Gagosian Gallery, 980 Madison Avenue, near 77th Street, (212) 744-2313, gagosian.com. (Smith)
Galleries: 57th Street
&#x2605; 'Duchamp Brothers & Sister': 'Works of Art' (through next Friday) Two of Marcel Duchamp's brothers, Jacques Villon and Raymond Duchamp-Villon, were artists, as was his sister, Suzanne. And all four siblings look intriguing, in quite different ways, in this chamber quartet of an exhibition based on one that Marcel himself organized in Manhattan a half-century ago. Francis M. Naumann Fine Art, 24 West 57th Street, Manhattan, (212) 582-3201, francisnaumann.com. (Cotter)
&#x2605; 'Egon Schiele's Women' (through Dec. 28) New York's most thorough look at Egon Schiele since a 2005 exhibition at the Neue Galerie finds the artist working through a long and impressively varied list of female models, including his mother; a rebellious sister who sometimes posed nude for him; anonymous pregnant women in a maternity hospital; a pair of young prostitutes known as the ''black-haired girls''; his redheaded lover Wally Neuzil; and his strait-laced bourgeois wife, Edith. In an accompanying book, the gallery owner, Jane Kallir, argues persuasively that Schiele, in contrast to contemporaries like Gustav Klimt, ''did not judge his women; he merely observed.'' Galerie St. Etienne, 24 West 57th Street, Manhattan, (212) 245-6734, gseart.com. (Rosenberg)
Galleries: SoHo
Bernadette Corporation: '2000 Wasted Years' (through Dec. 16) A Warholian spoof of branding, publicity and media, this retrospective of the influential collaborative known as the Bernadette Corporation is depressingly arch. Resembling an ultra-hip design and fashion firm's showroom, the installation includes mannequins in avant-garde clothes; videos of runway shows; scarves and other accessories produced by the Bernadette Corporation; conceptually pointed publications; and a trailer for a documentary about the riots during the 2001 G-8 summit in Genoa with commentary by the actress Chlo Sevigny. Artists Space, 38 Greene Street, (212) 226-3970, artistsspace.org. (Johnson)
Guillermo Kuitca: 'Diarios,' Jos Antonio Surez Londoo: 'The Yearbooks,' and 'In Deed: Certificates of Authenticity in Art' (through Dec. 9) Closed for a year for an upgrade, this venerable SoHo institution now has three galleries under one roof and an inaugural show in each of them, including the first New York museum-style exhibition of the Argentine painter Guillermo Kuitca, a small survey of illustrational drawings by Jos Antonio Surez Londoo of Colombia, and a smart and amusing selection of artist-made professional contracts. Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 219-2166, drawingcenter.org. (Cotter)
Galleries: Other
&#x2605; Gerard Byrne: 'Why It's Time for Imperial, Again' (through Nov. 25) ''Why It's Time for Imperial, Again'' is a brilliant, funny and prescient seven-minute video. It dramatizes an oddly stilted conversation between a car salesman promoting Chrysler's new Imperial and a potential customer, both played by remarkably wooden actors against a shifting background of industrial decrepitude. The script is from a 1980 dialogue between Lee Iacocca, then the chairman of Chrysler, and Frank Sinatra published as an advertising supplement in National Geographic magazine. It sounds like a David Mamet play. Itinerant Protocinema, 31 Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (917) 660-7332, protocinema.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; 'A Disagreeable Object' (through Nov. 26) This group show uses a phrase from Giacometti to lend some context to a present in which casual attitudes toward sculpture have become commonplace and plenty of value, material and otherwise, is attached to objects without pedestals. The main point here is a new-old one: what looks like cheerful insouciance about the art object is actually a deadly serious reaction to the vagaries of war, technology and the economy. SculptureCenter, 44-19 Purves Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 361-1750, sculpture-center.org. (Rosenberg)
'The Islands of Benot Mandelbrot: Fractals, Chaos, and the Materiality of Thinking' (through Jan. 27) This heady, compact exhibition presents efforts from the 1960s and '70s to visualize a species of mathematical formulas known as fractals, a term coined by the mathematician Benot Mandelbrot (1924-2012). The visual impact of the computer printouts, short films, 3-D models, letters, sketches and Polaroids on display is low, but the philosophical import is great considering the enormous advances in scientific imaging technology that have happened since those early days. Bard Graduate Center, 18 West 86th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3023, bgc.bard.edu. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Simon Dinnerstein: 'The Fulbright Triptych' (ongoing) This little-known masterpiece of 1970s realism was begun by the young Simon Dinnerstein during a Fulbright fellowship in Germany in 1971 and completed in his hometown, Brooklyn, three years later. Incorporating carefully rendered art postcards, children's drawings and personal memorabilia; a formidable worktable laid out with printmaking tools and outdoor views; and the artist and his family, it synthesizes portrait, still life, interior and landscape and rummages through visual culture while sampling a dazzling range of textures and representational styles. It should be seen by anyone interested in the history of recent art and its oversights. German Consulate General, 871 United Nations Plaza, First Avenue, at 49th Street, (212) 610-9700, germany.info. (Smith)
&#x2605; Penny Slinger: 'An Exorcism Revisited' (through Nov. 30) Born in England, Penny Slinger emerged from art school in 1969, a time when lots of liberations were under way, including the nascent women's movement. The earliest works in her first New York solo are six short films from that year. They're student pieces, but pretty out there for the time. The main piece is her still unpublished book of photo-collages and texts called ''An Exorcism.'' A blend of ''Rebecca'' and ''Story of O,'' it's yet another reminder of the adventure that feminist art in the 1960s and '70s was. Broadway 1602, 1181 Broadway, Third Floor, (212) 481-0362, broadway1602.com. (Cotter)
Toxic Beauty: 'The Art of Frank Moore' (through Dec. 8) This lavishly detailed retrospective pays tribute to a multifaceted career in painting, set design, film and political activism that was cut short by AIDS in 2002, when the artist was 48. In a time -- the 1980s and '90s -- when some artists re-embraced representational painting and others tackled thorny political topics, Moore did both, and with unusual flair, reviving and revising a panoply of outr realist styles in luminous allegorical canvases that comment on, and link, environmental degradation and the tragedy of AIDS. Grey Art Gallery, 100 Washington Square East, (212) 998-6780, nyu.edu/greyart; and the Tracey/Barry Gallery at Fales Library in Bobst Library, 70 Washington Square South, (212) 998-2596, nyu.edu/library/bobst/research/fales.

Public Art
'Common Ground' (through Nov. 30) Located on a site known in the 17th century as the Commons -- which also served as the site of Bloombergville, the precursor to Occupy Wall Street -- this show offers some incendiary critiques. Ian Hamilton Finlay's group of stone slabs arranged on a patch of grass includes inscriptions from the writings of Louis de Saint-Just (1767-94), a French Revolutionary leader. Paul McCarthy's ''Daddies Ketchup'' (2001), a huge inflatable bottle of ketchup makes a Neo-Pop-psychoanalytic connection between patriarchy and power, and Elmgreen & Dragset's aluminum bullhorn housed in a slick, industrial vitrine evokes protesters in Zuccotti Park, who were forbidden from using any amplification devices, developed a signature form of analogue augmentation, the ''people's microphone.'' City Hall Park, Public Art Fund, (212) 223-7800, publicartfund.org. (Schwendener)
&#x2605; Tatzu Nishi: 'Discovering Columbus' (through Dec. 2) In his first commission in the United States, a Japanese artist known for temporarily privatizing monuments and landmarks around the globe by building fully outfitted living rooms or hotel suites around them, takes on the statue of Christopher Columbus perched above Columbus Circle. A free timed ticket and a six-story climb (or elevator ride) yields the semi-Surreal sight of the sculpture presiding over an upscale living room. But the ravishing views may be the main treat. Open daily, from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m., at Columbus Circle, at Broadway and Central Park South. Free tickets available at publicartfund.org, (866) 607-5461 or the information desk at the Shops at Columbus Circle, third floor. (Smith)
Out of Town
&#x2605; Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden: 'Ai Weiwei: According to What?' (through Feb. 24) As seen in its first American survey, the work of the lionhearted Chinese artist Ai Weiwei, is no match for his prominent role as a human rights advocate. The sculptures and installation pieces too often adhere to the fashionable international genre of handsome, Conceptually generated artworks. Explanatory labels do much of the heavy lifting, along with historically-charged materials and objects, like Chinese antique furniture and wood from destroyed Qing dynasty temples. The artist's photographs and videos suggest that his documentary work may be best. On the National Mall, at Independence Avenue Southwest and Seventh Street, Washington, (202) 633-4674, hirshhorn.si.edu; free. (Smith)
'Anti-Establishment' (through Dec. 21) Contrary to this muddled exhibition's title, the artists it presents are not uncompromising rebels. The show's curator, Johanna Burton, avers that they imagine ''novel collective relationships and emergent models of engaged citizenship,'' but much of the work is more self-reflexively preoccupied with art than with worldly affairs. Best of all is a room full of Abstract Expressionist-style paintings made with Day-Glo paints by Jacqueline Humphries displayed under ultra violet light. It is a lushly visual trip. Hessel Museum of Art, Bard College Center for Curatorial Studies, Annandale-on-Hudson, (845) 758-7598, bard.edu/ccs. (Johnson)
'From 199A to 199B: Liam Gillick' (through Dec. 21) Mr. Gillick is a nearly ubiquitous figure on the international art scene as a conceptual artist, speaker, writer and collaborator with other luminaries like Rirkrit Tiravanija and Pierre Huyghe. He designs shiny, quasi-architectural sculptures for sale in commercial galleries, but here the focus is on politically motivated conceptual projects from the 1990s. If sociology and ideology are your things, this show is for you. Center for Curatorial Studies, Bard College, Annandale-on-Hudson, (845) 758-7598, bard.edu/ccs. (Johnson)
Institute of Contemporary Art, Pennsylvania: 'Jeremy Deller: Joy in People' (through Dec. 30) The British artist Jeremy Deller, the subject of this thought-provoking show, is the anti-Damien Hirst. He has fashioned a Turner Prize-winning career devoted to breaking down the traditional walls between art and the world at large. Rather than producing visually arresting objects for sale in antiseptic galleries he has organized parades; created odd signs and bumper stickers; made a film about Depeche Mode fans around the world; and orchestrated a historical re-enactment of a large, violent conflict between striking coal miners and police in Orgreave, in South Yorkshire, in 1984. University of Pennsylvania, 118 South 36th Street, Philadelphia, (215) 898-7108, icaphila.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art: 'Oh Canada' (through April 8) Seesawing between bigness and intimacy, the personal and the communal, this 62-artist survey of contemporary art in the Great White North may tell you more about Canada's identity crisis than it does about Canadian art. A sense of place, if not nationhood, does emerge in stark photographs of Newfoundland by Ned Pratt and Kim Morgan's hanging latex cast of a lighthouse on Prince Edward Island. Elsewhere, cartoonlike pencil drawings by Annie Pootoogook and Shuvinai Ashoona depict contemporary Inuit life and the artist Amalie Atkins stars in a prairie fairy tale involving musical wolves and bears with golden teeth. 87 Marshall Street, North Adams, (413) 662-2111, massmoca.org. (Rosenberg)
National Gallery of Art: 'Roy Lichtenstein: A Retrospective' (through Jan. 13) The first major survey of this Pop artist's career work since his death, at 73, in 1997, is a big show and has some slow spots, but on the whole it moves right along. As always, Lichtenstein's large-featured images, with their Ben-Day dot patterns; thick, black contours; and flat, bright colors are almost ergonomically comfortable to the eye. On the National Mall, between Third and Seventh Streets, at Constitution Avenue NW, Washington, (202) 737-4215, nga.gov. (Cotter)
&#x2605; National Museum of African Art: 'African Cosmos: Stellar Arts' (through Dec. 9) Packed with celestial bodies and patches of darkness sending forth light, this show is about the extent and persistence of cosmological consciousness in art, old and new, from the African continent. It's also a bold demonstration of a more specific reality: that in Africa, art and science, including astronomy, have always intersected, and continue to, whether in prayers on an ancient Egyptian mummy case asking that the deceased owner be lifted to the stars or in a contemporary video projection that simulates the aurora borealis. Visitors to the National Museum of African Art should also take in the smart, stimulating reinstallation of the permanent collection. Smithsonian Institution, 950 Independence Avenue SW, Washington, (202) 633-4600, africa.si.edu. (Cotter)
&#x2605; The Walters Art Museum: 'Revealing the African Presence in Renaissance Europe' (through Jan. 21) This history-rattling exhibition is a visual gift, with marvelous things by artists familiar and revered -- Durer, Rubens, Veronese -- along with images most of us never knew existed. Together, they map a history of art, politics and race that few museums have addressed in full-dress style. Like the best scholarship, the Walters show, organized by Joaneath Spicer, the museum's curator of Renaissance and Baroque art, is as much about questions as answers. It takes a prized piece of art history, one polished to a glow by generations of attention, and turns it in an unexpected direction, so it catches the searching, scouring rays of new investigative light. (From Feb. 16 to June 9 it will be at the Princeton University Art Museum in Princeton, N.J.) 600 North Charles Street, Baltimore, (410) 547-9000, thewalters.org. (Cotter)
Last Chance
&#x2605; 'Distance and Desire': 'Encounters with the African Archive, Part I: Santu Mofokeng and A.M. Duggan-Cronin' (closes on Saturday) Born in Ireland in 1874, Alfred Martin Duggan-Cronin photographed in South Africa until his death in 1954, creating a multivolume book -- a record of indigenous peoples and of ways of life that he feared were disappearing. In 1997, Santu Mofokeng, born in Johannesburg in 1956, completed a book-length compilation of urban African studio portraits dating to the colonial era. The Duggan-Cronin photographs, seen in mounted pages from his books in this show, perpetuate an old view of Africans as being, by definition, rural, tradition-bound, on the verge of extinction. The studio portraits gathered in Mr. Mofokeng's archive present Africans as they chose to see themselves, as global citizens with modern histories. The Walther Collection, 526 West 26th Street, Suite 718, Chelsea, (212) 352-0683, walthercollection.com. (Cotter)
'We the People' (closes on Saturday) Timed to coincide with the final weeks of the presidential election, this enervating exhibition of works by 68 artists extols American democracy. It includes patriotic posters by Norman Rockwell and LeRoy Neiman, but the overall drift is, unsurprisingly, to the left. There are paintings by Alice Neel, Nicole Eisenman and, most prominently, a billboard-size portrait of Mitt Romney by Richard Phillips. Sculptors include Duane Hanson, creator of a startling super-realistic portrait of a scruffy youth titled ''High School Student.'' Robert Rauschenberg Foundation Project Space, 455 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 228-5283, rauschenbergfoundation.org. (Johnson)

GRAPHIC: PHOTO: INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'RISE AND FALL OF APARTHEID: PHOTOGRAPHY AND BUREAUCRACY OF EVERYDAY LIFE': (through Jan. 6) With more than 500 photographs -- supplemented by books, magazines, posters and films -- spread over two floors, this show documenting institutionalized racism in South Africa from 1948 to the election of Nelson Mandela in 1994 can't help being overwhelming. But the show (an exhibition view of it is above) is pitched as much to the mind as to the heart. On the one hand it's a grand narrative of stirring sights: ardent faces, agitated bodies, camaraderie, clenched fists, funerals. It's also a disquisition on the ordinariness of goodness and evil, on how people in a particular time and place encounter and partake of both, and go on with their lives. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org.

HEADLINE: The Age Of Possibility

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
At some point over the past generation, people around the world entered what you might call the age of possibility. They became intolerant of any arrangement that might close off their personal options.
The transformation has been liberating, and it's leading to some pretty astounding changes. For example, for centuries, most human societies forcefully guided people into two-parent families. Today that sort of family is increasingly seen as just one option among many.
The number of Americans who are living alone has shot up from 9 percent in 1950 to 28 percent today. In 1990, 65 percent of Americans said that children are very important to a successful marriage. Now, only 41 percent of Americans say they believe that. There are now more American houses with dogs than with children. 
This is not a phenomenon particular to the United States. In Scandinavia, 40 percent to 45 percent of the people live alone. The number of marriages in Spain has declined from 270,000 in 1975 to 170,000 today, and the number of total Spanish births per year is now lower than it was in the 18th century.
Thirty percent of German women say they do not intend to have children. In a 2011 survey, a majority of Taiwanese women under 50 said they did not want children. Fertility rates in Brazil have dropped from 4.3 babies per woman 35 years ago to 1.9 babies today.
These are all stunningly fast cultural and demographic shifts. The world is moving in the same basic direction, from societies oriented around the two-parent family to cafeteria societies with many options.
This global phenomenon has been expertly analyzed in a report called ''The Rise of Post-Familialism: Humanity's Future?'' written by a team of scholars including Joel Kotkin, Anuradha Shroff, Ali Modarres and Wendell Cox.
Why is this happening? The report offers many explanations. People are less religious. People in many parts of the world are more pessimistic and feeling greater economic stress. Global capitalism also seems to be playing a role, especially, it seems, in Asia.
Many people are committed to their professional development and fear that if they don't put in many hours at work they will fall behind or close off lifestyle options.
Toru Suzuki, a researcher at the National Institute of Population and Society Security Research in Japan, gave Kotkin's team this explanation in its baldest form: ''Under the social and economic systems of developed countries, the cost of a child outweighs the child's usefulness.''
Singapore is one of the most interesting cases. Like most Asian societies, it used to be incredibly family-centered. But, as the economy boomed, the marriage rate plummeted. Singapore now has one of the lowest fertility rates in the world. ''The focus in Singapore is not to enjoy life, but to keep score: in school, in jobs, in income,'' one 30-year-old Singaporean demographer told the researchers. ''Many see getting attached as an impediment to this.''
This cultural shift is bound to have huge consequences. Globally, countries that remain fertile, like the U.S., will do fine while countries that don't, like Japan, will decline. Geographically, singles will dominate city life while two-parent families will be out in suburbia. Politically, married people in America are more likely to vote Republican; Mitt Romney easily won among married voters, including married women. Democrats, meanwhile, have done a much better job relating to single people. President Obama crushed Romney among singles, 62 percent to 35 percent.
The 2012 election results illustrate the gradual transition we are making from one sort of demography (the current Republican coalition) toward another sort of demography (the Democratic coalition). The rise of post-familialism is a piece of that shift.
My view is that the age of possibility is based on a misconception. People are not better off when they are given maximum personal freedom to do what they want. They're better off when they are enshrouded in commitments that transcend personal choice -- commitments to family, God, craft and country.
The surest way people bind themselves is through the family. As a practical matter, the traditional family is an effective way to induce people to care about others, become active in their communities and devote themselves to the long-term future of their nation and their kind. Therefore, our laws and attitudes should be biased toward family formation and fertility, including child tax credits, generous family leave policies and the like.
But the two-parent family is obviously not the only way people bind themselves. We are inevitably entering a world in which more people search for different ways to attach. Before jumping to the conclusion that the world is going to hell, it's probably a good idea to investigate these emerging commitment devices.
The problem is not necessarily a changing family structure. It's people who go through adulthood perpetually trying to keep their options open.

HEADLINE: Northeast Storm Spurs Surge of Jobless Claims

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- Sandy, the storm that pulverized the Northeast late last month, drove a surge in new claims for jobless benefits last week and hurt factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region in November, signs it could deal a substantial blow to economic growth in the fourth quarter. 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 78,000 to a seasonally adjusted 439,000, the highest level since April 2011, the Labor Department said on Thursday.
It was the biggest one-week increase since a spike caused by Hurricane Katrina in September 2005.
Because the storm's impact is expected to be temporary, the data gave few clues as to the underlying health of the nation's economy. But it appears the short-term hit could be greater than economists previously thought.
''We will likely see a step back in job growth,'' Ryan Sweet, senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pa. The nation's jobs market has had a painfully slow recovery from the 2007-09 recession and the unemployment rate remains near 8 percent.
In addition to the storm, the economic recovery is laboring against the uncertainty over the path of federal budget policy.
Economic growth is expected to slow sharply in the fourth quarter as businesses and consumers hold back on purchases as a result of fears of the impact of mandated tax increases and spending cuts, a Reuters poll showed on Thursday.
Economists expect job growth in the United States to slow to an average 144,000 jobs a month over the final three months of the year from 174,000 in the third quarter.
An analyst from the Labor Department said several states from the mid-Atlantic and Northeast reported large increases in new filings for unemployment benefits last week because of he storm.
Retail sales data on Wednesday pointed to a softening in consumer spending early in the fourth quarter as Sandy discouraged automobile purchases last month.
Separately, data from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank showed manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic unexpectedly contracted this month. The Philadelphia Fed's business activity index slumped to -10.7 from 5.7 the month before.
Any reading below zero indicates a decline in the region's manufacturing. The storm led firms in the region to reduce activity by about two days on average, the Philadelphia Fed said.
The Labor Department said in another report that the Consumer Price Index edged up just 0.1 percent last month, with a rise in shelter costs offsetting a drop in gasoline prices.

HEADLINE: School Districts, Eyeing Looming Debt Crisis, Brace for More Cutbacks

BYLINE: By MOTOKO RICH

 BODY:
During the campaign, both President Obama and Mitt Romney repeatedly extolled the value of schools and teachers. Mr. Romney, in their first debate last month, even vowed, ''I'm not going to cut education funding.''
But if his fellow Republicans in Congress and Mr. Obama cannot agree on a resolution for the country's looming debt crisis, the automatic budget cuts and tax increases that will kick in next year could spawn another round of belt-tightening at public schools already battered by the recession and its aftermath.
If the government is unable to come to a resolution, federal education programs for elementary and high schools would lose a little over $2 billion -- or close to 8 percent of the current budget -- starting next fall, according to the Office of Management and Budget and the Education Department.
School districts around the country are bracing for cutbacks. In Boston, programs for English language learners and students at risk of failing a grade would be curtailed. In Cleveland, where the district has already lopped 50 minutes off the school day and limited art and music, officials fear they would have to curtail a literary program for struggling fourth and fifth graders, and lay off more classroom teachers. Miami-Dade, which has so far avoided pink slips for teachers, would probably start issuing them. 
While federal funding generally represents about 10 percent of public school budgets, schools have already lost millions of dollars in state money. According to an analysis by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal-leaning research and advocacy group, 26 states cut funding this school year, and two-thirds of states are providing less money for public education than they did five years ago. It may be several years before state coffers recover enough to restore funding to previous levels.
At the same time, schools have been hobbled as another important source of financing -- property tax collections -- has plunged after the housing crisis.
While declines in state and local funding affect most public schools, cuts in federal funding would jeopardize services at schools that serve the neediest children. Federal funding for elementary and secondary education is directed primarily at low-income students as well as English language learners and those with special education needs.
''It in essence widens the gaps between the haves and have-nots,'' said Daniel A. Domenech, executive director of the American Association of School Administrators. ''The wealthy suburban communities that receive very little federal funding -- it's not going to have much impact on them.''
But at urban school districts where a majority of the students are poor, a decline in federal funding, he said, ''is going to be catastrophic over the reductions they've had over the last four years.''
At the Orchard Gardens K-8 Pilot School in Roxbury, Mass., a neighborhood of Boston, Andrew Bott, the principal, fears that the work the school has accomplished in recent years could be stalled. The school, which was one of the city's worst performing a few years ago, has used federal funds to add an hour to the school day, establish academies during breaks in the school year for students who fall behind and bring in extra help for struggling readers. As a result, Mr. Bott said, test scores have improved. ''Money isn't always the answer,'' he said. ''But when you have a good plan and invest it well, it makes all the difference.''
Conservatives have argued that federal education spending has more than doubled in the last four decades, while test scores have not risen much. ''I think the evidence is pretty overwhelming that federal involvement in K-12 education has not resulted in meaningful academic gains,'' said Neal McCluskey, associate director of the Center for Educational Freedom at the Cato Institute, a libertarian policy group.
But with schools being asked to raise students to higher standards, evaluate teachers more rigorously and compete internationally, education advocates say funding cuts are devastating.
''It's lunacy to talk about cutting an investment,'' said Randi Weingarten, head of the American Federation of Teachers, ''when we know that we need to make sure that educating all kids is as effective and efficient and as great as possible to move all kids to 21st-century learning skills.''
In Cleveland, for example, where all students qualify for free or reduced lunch, the district has already slashed $114 million -- close to 9 percent -- from its budget over the past two years. Automatic cuts in federal spending could imperil $4 million more.
''We're counting on federal funding,'' said Eric S. Gordon, chief executive of the Cleveland Metropolitan School District, where class sizes are up to 40 students in some schools. ''Not to be able to do extras, but just to provide the basic instructional services that you would expect of a school district.''
Mr. Gordon said he found the prospect of federal education cuts particularly troubling after local taxpayers just approved an increase in property tax rates for the first time in 16 years to aid education.
Voters in several other states have also shown support for public schools, by either approving new taxes or rejecting measures that would have diminished education funding.
In California, a ballot initiative to increase annual taxes by $6 billion to help the state's public schools passed easily this month. In Florida, voters defeated a measure that would have limited state revenues, and therefore endangered state education funding. And in North Dakota, voters rejected a ballot measure to eliminate local property taxes, a crucial source of school funding.
In a notable exception, public school budgets took a hit in Arizona on Election Day, when voters rejected a proposal to extend a temporary 1-cent sales tax that would have raised close to $80 million annually for both K-12 and higher education in the state. According to the Center on Budget report, state funding for elementary and secondary students has already fallen close to 22 percent in Arizona since 2008.
Supporters of the measure argued that the state had already cut full-day kindergarten, eliminated librarians and guidance counselors and increased class sizes. ''Some of those things will now get worse,'' said Ann-Eve Pedersen, statewide chairwoman of a committee supporting the sales tax proposition. Opponents, who included the state treasurer, argued that education spending in the state was high enough, and that tough choices had to be made. What is more, said Jonathan Butcher, education director of the Goldwater Institute, which orchestrated the ''no'' campaign, the state had sought other ways to improve education, like broadening the number of charter schools. ''Arizona has made bold steps to address the issue without just pouring money into the system and expecting money to solve the problem,'' Mr. Butcher said.
Even those who support changes in educational policy -- including the expansion of charter schools -- say that cutting funding would harm students.
''Everyone should be strenuously advocating for changes that will improve the quality of teaching and instruction, but we should also recognize that those changes cost money,'' said Jonah Edelman, chief executive of Stand for Children, a nonprofit advocacy group. It supported the sales tax in Arizona but has drawn fire from teachers unions and parent advocacy groups because it favors charter schools as well as other changes, including teacher evaluations tethered to test results.
''You can't do, quote-unquote, reform on the cheap,'' Mr. Edelman said.

HEADLINE: With Gaza Attacks, Egypt's President Balances Hamas Against Israeli Peace

BYLINE: By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK and MAYY EL SHEIKH

 BODY:
CAIRO -- The escalating conflict in Gaza has confronted President Mohamed Morsi of Egypt with a wrenching test of his commitments -- to his fellow Islamists of the militant group Hamas and to Egypt's landmark peace agreement with Israel.
Over two days, Mr. Morsi, a former leader of the Muslim Brotherhood who has denounced Israelis as ''vampires'' for the killing of Palestinian civilians, seemed to reach for every diplomatic gesture he could make without jeopardizing the treaty. 
''The Egyptian people, the Egyptian leadership, Egyptian government and all of Egypt is standing with all its resources to stop this assault, to prevent the killing and bloodshed of the Palestinians,'' Mr. Morsi declared on Thursday in a televised address. ''Israelis must recognize that we do not accept this aggression.''
But with Israel and Hamas increasing their attacks and a possible Israeli ground assault looming, Mr. Morsi finds himself in a tighter bind. As Egypt's first freely elected president, he faces popular demands for a radical break with former President Hosni Mubarak's perceived acquiescence during an Israeli assault against the Palestinians in 2009. But at the same time, Mr. Morsi desperately needs to preserve the stability of the cold peace with Israel in order to secure Western aid and jump-start his moribund economy.
Aware of his divided loyalties, both sides appear to be testing him. Hamas, the Islamist Palestinian offshoot of Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood, is pushing to see how much support it can draw from its ideological big brother now that it governs the largest Arab state. And Israel's hawkish leadership seems determined to probe the depth of Mr. Morsi's stated commitment to the peace treaty as well.
''We are testing the Egyptians,'' said Professor Efraim Inbar, director of the Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies at Bar Ilan University. ''The Americans are with us on Hamas. Obviously Morsi supports Hamas and not us.''
Mr. Morsi has so far taken diplomatic steps to signal his displeasure with Israel. He recalled Egypt's ambassador to Tel Aviv and dispatched his prime minister on a solidarity mission to Gaza. He appealed to President Obama, the United Nations, the European Union and the Arab League to try to stop the violence.
Mr. Morsi also opened Egypt's borders and hospitals to Gaza residents injured in the clashes and offered military helicopters to transport them. He met with top generals, and Egyptian state media reported that they were inspecting air bases and preparing land defenses near the Gaza border. He has not, however, threatened to provide military support to Hamas or direct action against Israel.
Inside Egypt, the alacrity of Mr. Morsi's response so far appears to have rallied the public behind him. Opposition to Israel's occupation of the Palestinian territories and treatment of their residents may be the only cause binding together Islamists, their secular critics and even the leadership of Egypt's Coptic Christian church. Some of Mr. Morsi's rivals, including the former presidential candidate Amr Moussa, have commended his actions.
''He is doing everything he can within the legal obligations of Egypt's relationship with Israel,'' said Emad Shahin, a political scientist at the American University of Cairo, arguing that Mr. Morsi's swift action would enable him to hold at bay the inevitable calls for Egypt to go further.
Still, popular anger and demands for more action could grow, especially if Israel initiates a ground invasion of Gaza. The Muslim Brotherhood, which backed Mr. Morsi for president, issued a statement denouncing ''the criminal aggression'' and blaming Arab states for ''watching the shedding of Palestinian blood without moving a muscle.''
''We think the least that could be done is to sever diplomatic and commercial relations with this cruel entity,'' the Brotherhood statement added, referring to Israel. ''The Egyptian government has to be the first to do this in order to set an example for Arabs and Muslims.''
The ultraconservative Islamists of the Al Nour party charged that Mr. Morsi's steps ''weren't enough'' and that ''additional steps are necessary to deter the perpetrator and to legally pursue the criminals until revenge is exacted against them.''
In the streets, protesters burned an Israeli flag outside the Arab League off Tahrir Square in Cairo. Leaders of the ministry that oversees mosques and religious institutions, unmuzzled by Mr. Mubarak's ouster, called on Muslim preachers at Friday prayers to rally support for Gaza.
Since the Brotherhood won leadership of the Egyptian Parliament and Hamas broke with its former sponsor Syria, the relationship between the two groups has become both closer and more complicated. The Brotherhood has welcomed a parade of Hamas leaders in Cairo, but it has also urged the group to maintain tranquil relations with Israel so that Hamas can try to steer Egypt through its difficult political transition, for the long-term well-being of both Islamist groups, their leaders have said.
Leaders of the Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party have said they planned to step back from Hamas to try to broker a reconciliation between the group and its Western-backed rival faction, Fatah, which controls the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank. Hamas has not recognized Israel, but the Brotherhood long ago came to support a two-state solution as envisioned by the Camp David accords.
In some ways, Mr. Morsi may have disappointed Hamas. He has not opened Egypt's border to Gaza. In fact, he has moved more aggressively than Mr. Mubarak to try to shut down or blow up smuggling tunnels from the Egyptian Sinai long used by Hamas to circumvent an Israeli boycott, contending that they pose a security risk to Egypt.
But on Thursday, Hamas leaders basked in Mr. Morsi's public support. ''The popularly elected Egyptian leadership is giving everyone a lesson,'' Hamas's leader, Khaled Mashaal, told an Islamist conference in Khartoum, Sudan. ''The Egyptian leadership has shown that it is taking a new course and adopting a new vision. The era when Israel did what it pleased is over.''
In Gaza, Ismail Haniyeh, the Hamas prime minister, said in a televised address that ''the Arab and Muslim cities were all in silence, but we found a quick response from the Egyptian leadership.'' He added: ''Leaders can no longer sit on their hands while seeing our people preyed on.''

HEADLINE: Demystifying the Fiscal Impasse That Is Vexing Washington

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
Many Americans must be wondering: What is all this about a ''fiscal cliff''? And why did it receive so little attention during the presidential campaign?
Well, it's complicated -- the so-called cliff, that is. And most solutions are politically painful. In a rare show of bipartisanship, or mutual protection, both parties ducked the debate until after the election. What follows is an attempt to demystify the issue, which President Obama and the lame-duck Congress now are struggling over, and which may occupy them right through the holidays.
Q. What is the fiscal cliff?
A. The term refers to more than $500 billion in tax increases and across-the-board spending cuts scheduled to take effect after Jan. 1 -- for fiscal year 2013 alone -- unless Mr. Obama and Republicans reach an alternative deficit-reduction deal. Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, who is not known for catchy phrases, coined the metaphor ''fiscal cliff'' last winter to warn of the dangerous yet avoidable drop-off ahead in the nation's fiscal path. It stuck. 
Q. If we go over this so-called cliff, what happens?
A. Taxes would rise for nearly every taxpayer and many businesses. Financing for most federal programs, military and domestic, would be cut. Many economists say that while annual budget deficits are too high, these new taxes and spending cuts would be too much deficit reduction, too suddenly, for a weak economy. More than $500 billion equals roughly 3 percent to 4 percent of gross domestic product. The Congressional Budget Office has said the result would be a short recession, though some analysts say the measures could be managed so they do less damage. ''Slope,'' they argue, is a better metaphor than cliff.
Q. Exactly what tax increases are in store?
A. When a tax cut expires, the practical effect is a tax increase. And a slew of tax cuts -- $400 billion for 2013 -- expire on Dec. 31: All of the Bush-era rate reductions; smaller tax cuts that periodically expire for businesses and individuals; and the 2-percentage-point cut in payroll taxes that Mr. Obama pushed in 2010, which increased an average worker's take-home pay by about $1,000 a year.
Also, 28 million taxpayers -- about one in five, all middle- to upper-income -- would have to pay the alternative minimum tax in 2012, raising their taxes more. That is because Congress has failed to pass an inflation adjustment, as it usually does, to restrict the number of taxpayers subject to the alternative minimum largely to the affluent.
Q. What spending would be cut?
A. An emergency unemployment-compensation program is expiring, which would save $26 billion but end payments to millions of Americans who remain jobless and have exhausted state benefits. Medicare payments to doctors would be reduced 27 percent, or $11 billion, because this year Congress has not passed the usual so-called ''doc fix'' to block the cuts, which otherwise are required by a 1990s cost-control law.
The biggest cut would be $65 billion, enacted across the board for most federal programs over the last nine months of fiscal year 2013, from January through September. This cut, known as the sequester, was mandated by an August 2011 budget deal between Mr. Obama and Congress that ended their standoff over raising the nation's debt limit. In that deal, they agreed to reduce spending by $1 trillion over 10 years and to identify an additional $1.2 trillion in savings by January 2013. If they fail to agree on the second installment -- as is the case so far -- the automatic cuts will kick in.
Q. Why did the parties create such a fiscal and economic threat?
A. It was part intentional, part coincidental.
The intentional: Since Ronald Reagan's administration, with mixed results, presidents and Congresses have occasionally mandated a self-imposed future crisis to force themselves to agree on unpopular tax and spending actions. In that spirit, the idea behind the August 2011 deal was that Republicans would so greatly fear the military cuts, and Democrats the domestic spending cuts, that they would negotiate a deficit-reduction alternative by the Jan. 1 deadline.
The coincidental: The measures from the 2011 deal are set to take effect at the same time as the changes to jobless benefits, the alternative minimum tax adjustment and the Medicare ''doc fix,'' and the expiration of the Bush tax cuts -- a confluence that the two parties did not fully expect back in August 2011. The nation will also reach its debt ceiling in January, creating additional uncertainty. Accounting maneuvers by the Treasury Department could push that deadline to March, but Mr. Obama wants a debt-limit increase as part of any deal, adding another item to the agenda.
Q. Can't Democrats and Republicans agree on anything here?
A. They actually agree on a lot. Neither side favors the sequester, an expanded alternative minimum tax or Medicare cuts for doctors; the issue in preventing those outcomes is where to find offsetting savings to avoid adding to annual deficits. And both parties want to extend all of the Bush tax cuts for 98 percent of taxpayers -- on income below $250,000 for couples and on income below $200,000 for individuals.
Their main disagreement is a familiar one: the Bush rates on income above that, for the top 2 percent of taxpayers. Mr. Obama campaigned against the rates in 2008 and in 2012. In December 2010, when the Bush tax cuts originally were to expire, Mr. Obama reluctantly agreed to extend all of them for two years in exchange for Republicans' support for the temporary payroll tax cut and extended jobless aid. This time, he swears, is different.
Q. If the president extended all the Bush rates once, why wouldn't he do so again for the right concessions?
A. The economy was weaker in 2010, and so was Mr. Obama. Republicans had just triumphed in the midterm elections, taking control of the House. Now Mr. Obama is fresh off re-election, and Congressional Democrats have gained seats. He vows that he will not allow the top tax rate to stay at 35 percent; a return to 39.6 percent would raise about $1 trillion over 10 years. Chastened Republicans have suggested they would support higher revenues, but only from limiting tax deductions for high-income taxpayers, not from higher rates. Mr. Obama has not ruled out a compromise that would limit deductions as well as setting the top rate above 35 percent but below 39.6 percent.
Q. What now? Might they really reach an impasse?
A. No one knows. Despite market jitters about that outcome, Democrats suggest that they are willing to let Jan. 1 come and go without resolution unless Republicans relent on the top rate. That could simply be bravado, to make Republicans blink. A Washington Post-Pew Research Center poll this week found that a majority of Americans would blame Republicans for failure.
Q. Is there a best-case outcome here?
A. Many budget experts and economists are hoping for a two-part deal. The first part would extend many of the tax cuts and repeal the automatic spending cuts to avert the changes scheduled after Jan. 1. But it would be contingent on the second part: a framework for reducing projected long-term deficits by overhauling both the tax code -- to raise revenues -- and entitlement programs -- chiefly Medicare and Medicaid, whose rising costs in an aging population are unsustainable. Those overhauls would preoccupy Mr. Obama and Congress through 2013 and perhaps 2014.
Such an agreement would set specific targets for new tax revenue and spending cuts to reduce deficits by about $4 trillion over a decade, giving Congress and the president more time to work out the details. If they failed to do so, presumably other automatic changes might be in store as an enforcement action -- setting up yet another looming deadline.

HEADLINE: A Texas Tale Too Big for a Lone Star

BYLINE: By BEN BRANTLEY

 BODY:
Music surfs the clouds in ''Giant.'' It seems fitting that for this adaptation of Edna Ferber's 1952 novel, which opened on Thursday night at the Public Theater, the orchestra sits not in a pit but in a loft above the stage, sandwiched between scrims aglow with vast skies and sunsets. This is a high-reaching musical, and practically every number in it is one of determined aspiration.
Anyone who knows the work of its composer, Michael John LaChiusa, can be assured that the score will soar and swirl appropriately. The ambitious and inventive creator of ''Hello Again'' and ''Marie Christine,'' Mr. LaChiusa can set notes to swooping and fluttering like wind-borne leaves in a storm.
But there's another, countervailing force at work here: a mighty tug of gravity that keeps pulling the show down to earth and even threatens to bury it. That force is the weighty obligation of condensing a plot-packed, multigenerational doorstop of a novel -- about big old, unruly Texas, to boot -- into a work that floats through 3 hours 15 minutes of stage time. 
And while there's much to praise in the ascending spirit that animates this show, gravity usually wins. It does have a way of doing that.
Let's not underestimate the achievement of the creators of ''Giant,'' who include the book writer Sybille Pearson, the director Michael Greif and some of the brightest performers in musicals today. The big-sky-evoking and changing-times-cuing technical team includes Allen Moyer (sets), Jeff Mahshie (costumes) and Kenneth Posner (lighting). Together these talented folks mostly manage to sustain our interest through a series of flashbacks -- and flashbacks within flashbacks -- portraying 27 years in the life of one contentious family.
And not only that. ''Giant'' -- which was first staged three years ago in a four-hour version at the Signature Theater in Arlington, Va. -- is so dense with themes and dogged exposition that it's remarkable it never collapses from the sheer bulk of them. Among them: the history and geography and flora and fauna of Texas, the economics of ranching and the oil industry, racial bigotry toward Mexicans, social philanthropy and, oh yes, a few love stories.
No wonder ''Giant'' features so many songs and stretches of dialogue that sound like catalogs. It's a long, crowded journey that ''Giant'' takes us on. Fortunately there are picturesque stops along the way, a few you might even call breathtaking.
A best seller 60 years ago for Ferber, an author more noted for breadth than depth, ''Giant'' is today known principally for George Stevens's 3-hour-20-minute film of 1956, starring Elizabeth Taylor, Rock Hudson and, in his last screen appearance, a scenery-gobbling James Dean.
It's a vista-loving, wide-open-spaces kind of movie, with plenty of longueurs. (The critic David Thomson called it ''a film that passes like the Atlantic in the night as you fly to England.'') But there are enduring pleasures in seeing the camera feast on the faces of Taylor, Hudson and Dean in their radiant primes.
The equivalents of cinematic close-ups in stage musicals are solos that reach out, grab us and hold us close. ''Giant'' has a few, but strangely they tend not to belong to the leading characters, who register mostly as handsome conduits for significant ideas and the furtherance of plot.
Ms. Pearson's touch-all-the-bases script, which draws more directly from Ferber's novel than the film did, follows the marriage of a couple who would seem to have nothing in common except sex. Jordan Benedict (known as Bick and valiantly embodied by Brian D'Arcy James), a strapping cattle baron, returns to his immense Texas ranch from a visit to Virginia with a genteel, book-loving bride, Leslie (the ever-proficient Kate Baldwin).
Bick and Leslie argue a lot, and make up a lot, which would be more compelling if there were any real chemistry between Mr. James and Ms. Baldwin. Bick's true soul mate is his older sister, Luz (a strappy Michele Pawk), who runs the ranch with him. Luz gets killed off early but comes back as a singing ghost to encourage Bick to remember his past.
Leslie finds herself uneasily drawn to the rough and hungry ranch hand Jett Rink (P J Griffith, in the Dean role), who wears his jeans tighter than anybody else. Because Leslie is a lady, she resists the attraction, and Jett pours his energy into digging for oil and financially outstripping the old-fashioned, land-conserving Bick. They and a lot of other people sing about how big Texas is and how big their desires are.
Some of these anthems are very pretty, with richly layered vocal and orchestral harmonies. Mr. LaChiusa has a wide musical vocabulary, and he deploys it deftly in numbers that subtly incorporate the styles of different eras and cultures, from the 1920s to the 1950s. He has the reputation of being a cerebral, even recondite, composer, but this is a tuneful and accessible score. (I even heard several guys whistling the first-act curtain number in the men's room during intermission.)
The problem is that the leading characters, who have those grand ''what I want'' solos, never feel completely individualized. When Leslie tells Bick that ''all I know about you is what you need,'' it's a fair assessment of our feelings toward many of the people onstage.
There are some fine supporting performances, particularly from the wonderful Bobby Steggert (as Bick and Leslie's timid rebel of a son) and Natalie Cortez (as his love interest). But only two performances blossom into fully dimensional life, and they're peripheral to the main story.
Those would be Katie Thompson's Vashti Hake Snythe, the good ol' gal from a neighboring ranch, and John Dossett's Bawley Benedict, Bick's wise old hermit of an uncle. Their characters may be as stereotypical as any of the others, but Ms. Thompson and Mr. Dossett endow these disappointed souls with a mix of emotional heft and quirky detail that make you take their losses and longings personally.
Their breakout numbers are detours from the central story, but the creators of ''Giant'' were right to leave them in. When Mr. Dossett sings with Mr. James about missed opportunities, or Ms. Thompson leads off a duet with Ms. Baldwin about problems in the marital bed, Bick and Leslie suddenly come into fresh and affecting focus.
Throughout the show there is never any question that ''Giant'' has control of its narrative. It tells its long and winding story with admirable clarity. But when Mr. Dossett and Ms. Thompson sing, you realize what you've been missing. That's the distinctive breath of specific lives, which too often in this show are swept up in the relentless winds of saga spinning.

HEADLINE: Finding the Beauty in African Sales

BYLINE: By ANITA POWELL

 BODY:
JOHANNESBURG -- Suzie Wokabi had sticker shock when she returned to her native Kenya in 2007 and saw that the high-end cosmetics she had used as a MAC makeup artist in the United States were in short supply -- and three times as expensive.
So after some years of preparation, Ms. Wokabi, now 35, raised about 16 million Kenyan shillings, about $187,000, to start her own brand of cosmetics, SuzieBeauty.
She joined a small but growing group of African entrepreneurs breaking into the continent's beauty and personal care market, a sector now dominated by international giants like Unilever, Procter & Gamble and L'Oral. And while sales are increasing, thanks at least in part to the continent's continuing economic boom, the companies still face the challenges of expanding beyond their own region and mastering Africa's sprawling informal trade system.
SuzieBeauty had its debut in January and its products are now available in nine stores, mostly specialty drugstores in Nairobi. The nine-item range offers makeup in saturated, bold colors, like the deep reddish-purple Zamba lipstick, which sells for 1,000 shillings. 
The products' names are a nod to their origins: zambarau means purple in Swahili, and a shimmery olive-green eyeshadow is dubbed Safari.
Ms. Wokabi said her research showed that SuzieBeauty products were the only Kenyan-designed cosmetics on the market. ''SuzieBeauty is for the African woman,'' she said. ''It's the first Kenyan cosmetics line, and I've created it for us. For the first time, we have something that belongs to us.''
The colors used by international brands are not always good for African women, she said. Also, ''the humidity levels, the climate, the sun, the African sun, it changes something. I've had to take all of that into consideration.''
The beauty industry in the Middle East and Africa was estimated at about $20.4 billion in 2011, according to the market research company Euromonitor International. South Africa alone represented $3.9 billion; Nigeria and Kenya are second and third among sub-Saharan nations, with Kenya's market totaling more than $260 million.
In comparison, the Asian market was estimated at $114 billion in 2011.
Over all, Africa is the next frontier for global luxury goods brands, said Fflur Roberts, Euromonitor's global head of luxury goods, noting that the continent is projected to have double-digit economic growth by the end of the next decade.
''However, consumers' appetite for luxury goods and the extent to which aspiration consumption culture might take root in frontier Africa are difficult to predict,'' Ms. Roberts said. ''What seems clear is that any new luxury goods venture into frontier Africa needs to be motivated by long-term rather than short-term potential. The most significant growth stories -- and returns on investment -- will probably not happen until post-2020.''
She warned, however, that for the smaller and midsize global players in the market, ''short-term investment could present more pitfalls than opportunities. This is because the sweet spot of the opportunity is simply too far into the future.''
As head of what is now a small local company, Ms. Wokabi says she feels her brand's future is rosy: She conducted focus groups that showed the average Kenyan woman was willing to spend as much as 20 percent of her salary on beauty products.
She sees her customers as young, educated women working in the city and making about 600,000 shillings a year, much more than Kenya's average annual per-capita income of about 153,685 shillings, an estimate from the International Monetary Fund.
Ms. Wokabi's products have been on the shelves for less than a year. While she could not offer sales figures, she did say that earnings were covering costs -- and that Zamba, the purple lipstick, is selling briskly.
She now wants to move her products into other East African countries, and then perhaps to Nigeria. She might eventually venture into hair products, too. ''I'd love SuzieBeauty to be an African-born cosmetics giant. My priority is to keep it Africa-wide,'' she said.
Another emerging African beauty brand, Africology, has taken a different path, linking its organic, back-to-nature ethos to a potato.
Renchia Droganis, a life coach and holistic healer, began making bespoke organic lotions and preparations for clients from the ''African potato'' plant that was growing wild on her farm in Knysna, along South Africa's southern coast. The edible root, known as hypoxis hemerocallidea, also is known as star flower and is widely used in traditional African medicine.
Liza Julius, Ms. Droganis's daughter, said that clients asked for more, and that prompted her to create the brand. The first retail store opened in 2010.
The flagship shop in Johannesburg offers a full-body wrap featuring African potato and marula oil, meant to soften and hydrate skin, for 800 rand, or $92. The potato also appears in a popular body butter that includes marula; rooibos, or red bush; and aloe vera, and sells for 230 rand.
While the company does not release sales, Silvana Bottega, chief executive of the Southern Africa Luxury Association, said that among high-end South African beauty brands, ''only Africology has really broken the volume mold.''
And while ''it's relatively easy to get into one of the distribution houses,'' Ms. Bottega said, what is not so simple for African brands is going international.
Yet Africology has done that, Ms. Julius said, beginning the process by placing its products in high-end hotels and resorts around Africa.
Customers ''were coming to find us to purchase the products for home use,'' she said, and the brand began to ship to stores in Turkey, Belgium and France. The company now plans to start distribution in the United States next year.
Another brand that has broken the national barrier is Bio-Oil, a stretch-mark treatment from South Africa now available in 38 countries.
Justin Letschert paid less than the equivalent of $500,000 for the company in 2000, buying it from the privately owned skin care company Union Swiss, based in Cape Town. He said Bio-Oil generated approximately $180 million in trade and retail sales in 2012, although little of that came from the continent.
One problem in Africa, he said, is distribution, with the continent's flourishing informal trade practices making organized efforts all but redundant.
In Kenya, for example, the company must pay import duties of 40 percent. ''But the informal traders pay nothing; they just drive in a truck and pay a bribe,'' he said. ''We can't sell our product in Kenya because the informal product is 40 percent cheaper.''
For now, he said, the company's strategy is to keep up its marketing for product awareness purposes, and to wait for the day when the retail systems improve.
So far, he said, the company's hard-knock upbringing has been central to its success -- and he predicts the same for other African entrepreneurs.
''Within Africa there is no support structure,'' he said. ''So you can be sure that if someone makes it here, they're not going to have a problem elsewhere.''

HEADLINE: Fashion Weighs a Deeper Investment in Africa

BYLINE: By LIZ ALDERMAN

 BODY:
ROME -- Has Africa's golden moment arrived? For the gurus of the luxury world, the answer is a resounding yes -- at least as a source of inspiration for design trends that are rippling through the fashion industry.
Designers from Vivienne Westwood to Jean Paul Gaultier have long drawn on the vibrancy of African culture in their clothing lines. But now the industry is taking a tentative look at whether it makes sense to put down larger stakes as the African economy begins to take its place alongside the world's other promising emerging markets. 
After decades of struggle, and despite continued challenges like poverty and conflict, a middle class is forming in several large countries that have managed to diversify their economies away from basic commodities and move toward modernization.
That is fueling a perceptible rise in large cities like Nairobi in the numbers of people who are aspiring to more than the basics, creating a demand for luxury goods that is in step with the trends seen in other growing countries like China and Brazil, participants at a luxury conference in Rome said Thursday. The event was convened by The International Herald Tribune.
''We all know that Nigeria was all about oil and natural resources for a long time,'' said Omoyemi Akerele, the creative and managing director of Style House Files, a guide to fashion, style and beauty. ''Now we have telecoms, banking, marketing, retail and tourism. As a result, more jobs have been created, consumer spending has increased and there is more disposable income.''
Studies offer wildly different estimates of the number of Africans moving into the middle class -- anywhere from 80 million to 300 million. What is certain is that economic output is surging: growth is forecast to rise to around 12 percent in 2015, after growing an average of 4.9 percent a year from 2000 to 2008.
For the moment, the big houses, including LVMH Mot Hennessy Louis Vuitton and PPR, have not set up retail outlets in the middle of the continent. Indeed, while Africa is slowly rising, many of its more than 50 countries continue to face deep-seated problems, including striking poverty and violence.
Other problems come in the form of a stark class divide. ''There's a lot of rich countries in Africa,'' said Farida Khelfa, a representative for Maison Schiaparelli of Algerian heritage who recently filmed a documentary on the Arab Spring's effects on young North Africans. ''The problem is that rich people keep the money; they raise their children in America or take the money out of the country with them. This needs to change.''
Nonetheless, an entrepreneurial spirit prevails outside these areas, and other initiatives are taking place. Some companies, for example, are working with African women on business projects that are empowering them with their own earnings for the first time.
What is more, young Africans are increasingly hip and knowledgeable. With Internet access, they are plugged into the latest trends from around the world, which influence their taste in fashion even as they incorporate their own stamp of originality.
''In Nairobi, a man in a tailored jacket with a scarf wrapped around him is the coolest, chicest man I've seen,'' said Kim Jones, the men's style director at Louis Vuitton. Mr. Jones spent his childhood following his father's Pan-African career, and his experience there infuses many of his designs.
''There is beauty everywhere, especially Africa,'' said Mr. Gaultier, whose 2005 ''Hommage  l'Afrique'' haute couture collection featured gauzy dresses with images of African masks floating subtly out of a bodice.

HEADLINE: Protests in Jordan Continue, With Calls for Ending the King's Rule

BYLINE: By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK

 BODY:
IRBID, Jordan -- Thousands of young men poured into the streets of Jordan's cities and towns for a third night of scattered protests against King Abdullah II, as the United States expressed support for the monarch. 
Thursday's protests around the country, most of which involved exchanges of rocks and tear gas, were set off this week by anger at a reduction in public fuel subsidies. Unlike previous demonstrations here, this week's protests for the first time have also called for ending the rule of King Abdullah II.
Crowds have borrowed the signature chant of the Arab Spring revolts -- ''The people want the fall of the regime!'' -- and added their own dances and rhymes comparing the king to Ali Baba, the legendary thief. In this affluent northern city, usually a bulwark of support for the king, some demonstrators spoke openly of demands for democracy.
''Our ambition is to get our rights,'' said Ali Ababene, a young man warming himself by a burning tire before dashing away ahead of the next volley of tear gas. ''Our problem is not the high prices. It is the audaciousness of the corruption.'' He added, ''It is about democracy, freedom and social justice.''
The protests here turned notably violent on Wednesday night, after the police shot and killed Qasi Omari, 22, now described in local graffiti as ''the martyr of the price hike.''
The Jordanian government said he was killed in a shootout with a group of armed men who assaulted a police station here on Wednesday night. But on Thursday, two members of his family and a witness to the killing said that he was unarmed, part of a group of about 30 unarmed men who walked to the police station to complain about abusive language they said officers had used while breaking up an earlier protest.
One of those men, Firas Sultan el Azzam, 28, said they had asked the police through a sliding front door, ''We want to know who gave you the right to curse us?'' He and Mr. Omari's family said the police then opened fire, killing Mr. Omari and wounding three others. Angry crowds then set fire to several government cars and burned down a municipal building, where a heavy contingent of plainclothes police officers was watching children play on Thursday.
The protests are expected to escalate after midday prayers across the country on Friday, and the family plans a funeral that day for Mr. Omari as well.
Established by the British after World War I, Jordan's monarchy is one of the few Western-backed Arab governments to remain in place through decades of coups and revolts. Jordan is also a pivotal United States ally, occupying a strategic location between Israel, Iraq and Syria, and it is one of the few Arab countries to have signed a peace treaty with Israel.
Asked about the protests, a State Department spokesman, Mark C. Toner, urged protesters to remain peaceful and expressed support for the reforms led by the king.
''We support King Abdullah II's road map for reform and the aspirations of the Jordanian people,'' Mr. Toner said, ''to foster a more inclusive political process that will promote security, stability, as well as economic development.''

HEADLINE: Soccer Fans Scramble To Make A Save

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

 BODY:
Real Oviedo, a soccer team in the proud province of Asturias, is about 300 miles north of Madrid and about a million miles behind Real Madrid, the powerhouse that along with F.C. Barcelona defines Spanish soccer.
Once a top-tier club, Real Oviedo tumbled as low as the fourth division, undone by years of financial negligence and political strife. Team staff members worked in a stadium bathroom when the power was turned off in their offices. Players revolted after not being paid. The current owner, charged with tax evasion, is missing. The club's tax bill of 1.9 million euros, or $2.4 million, is due at the end of the year. Bankruptcy beckoned.
So about two weeks ago, Real Oviedo sold shares in the team online for 10.75 euros, or about $14. The club may never rival Real Madrid or F.C. Barcelona, but the effort, which ends Saturday, might keep it alive.
Fueled by Twitter messages by a British sportswriter in Spain, fans from Britain, South America, China and elsewhere have snapped up thousands of shares. Real Oviedo alumni playing in the English Premier League bought some and urged fans to do the same. Real Madrid said it would buy 100,000 euros' worth of shares. One fan near Portland, Ore., promised to get a Real Oviedo tattoo if others bought 100 shares. She got the tattoo. 
By Wednesday, the team had raised about 1.57 million euros, mostly from people who had never been to Spain, let alone seen Real Oviedo play live. Nearly 40 percent of the more than 20,000 new shareholders are from 60 countries outside Spain. After the spasm of support, well-heeled investors from Britain, Mexico and Spain are studying the club's books to decide whether to buy stakes.
''We are living in a remarkable moment in the history of Real Oviedo,'' said Pedro Zuazua, one of four board members installed in July to help overhaul the club. ''We were desperate. We thought the club was going to disappear.''
Never mind that the shares are essentially worthless. Sure, fans with four or more shares can attend the annual shareholders meeting in Spain. And the club, grateful for the support, has promised any shareholder living overseas free admission to Real Oviedo home games.
The club has been clear that buying shares in the third-division team is little more than a quixotic gesture. They will not be traded on any organized exchange, and because so many are being issued, the value will probably diminish. Their appeal, however, is more universal.
''It's a romantic view of 'why not help these people recover their club and keep it away from big investors,' '' said Juan Ramon, another board member added to represent Real Oviedo supporters.
It is not the first time that fans have tried to rescue a hard-luck team. The N.F.L.'s Green Bay Packers sold shares several times in their early years to save themselves, and they remain the only publicly owned team in the four largest professional leagues in the United States. Devotion to the team is so absolute that tens of thousands of Packers fans paid $250 for share certificates last year to help pay for a stadium expansion.
In 2001, soccer fans banded together to revive Swansea City in Wales, and similar supporters' trusts have helped save other British teams. Fans also own parts of teams in other countries, including Australia and Mali.
But no team has generated such rapid support from so many people with no direct connection to the club. Instantaneous communication tools like Twitter have helped. So has sympathy for Real Oviedo's fans, who have supported the team despite apathetic owners and antagonistic politicians. There is also the universal narrative of an underdog fighting to survive in a sport dominated by extremely wealthy teams.
''I'm reluctant to hang medals on Oviedo that it doesn't deserve,'' said Sid Lowe, a sportswriter in Madrid for The Guardian, whose Twitter messages with the hashtag #SOSRealOviedo triggered the wave of interest outside Spain. ''But maybe actually there is a power in doing things from a grass-roots effort. It could be a sign of hope for people who don't like modern football.''
Many fans who bought shares appear aware of the team's rich heritage, which includes 38 years in La Liga, Spanish soccer's best league. They know that Real Oviedo qualified for the European championships in the early 1990s, that it produced stars like Juan Mata and Santi Cazorla, and that its old home ground hosted a World Cup match in 1982.
Yaoyi Chen, who lives in Fuzhou, China, bought four shares ''to show my attitude that I want to save Real Oviedo,'' he said in an e-mail.
''It's a pity that I have no chance to go to Spain,'' said Chen, who has followed the team since the late 1990s, when he saw Real Oviedo beat Real Madrid on television. He knows the team's best players, and he knows the story of its fall to the fourth division.
Chen took it upon himself to translate the team's English Web site into Chinese. Fans, perhaps aware of the team's heritage, have done the same thing in Italy, in Germany and elsewhere.
Other fans appear drawn to the team's hard-luck story in an economically troubled country, a story that has resonated in places going through their own tough times.
''I was reading about the struggles of the club on Twitter, and I really got into it,'' said Juan Quintero of Livingston, N.J., who lost power after Hurricane Sandy and had to wait eight days before he could buy four shares. ''It was a momentary distraction from heating the house.''
Quintero, whose great-grandfather was born in Asturias, cited another motivation shared by many fans: the rare chance to own a slice, even a tiny one, of a sports team.
''You could say it really is a club of the people and by the people,'' he said. ''It sounds cheesy, but that's how you can describe it.''
Sherrilynn Rawson, an elementary school administrator near Portland, was also struck by the historical and cultural similarities between northwestern Spain and the northwestern United States, where her favorite team, the Portland Timbers, has a devoted following despite having played for years in a lower league.
She promised to get a tattoo of Real Oviedo's logo if members of the Timbers Army fan club bought at least 100 shares in the Spanish club. They bought more than 400.
''Our story is more of a comic strip compared to their soap opera,'' said Rawson, who speaks Spanish but has never been to Spain. ''The vast majority of the time, the folks who really love the sport -- the fans -- have absolutely no hope of ever owning any fraction of a professional sports team.''
While Real Oviedo may meet its target and stave off bankruptcy, the club's troubles are far from over. It has 17 million euros of total debt, and if it is promoted to the second division, it will need more money to compete against the stronger teams there. Still, given the alternative, just getting by is fine for now.
''We are afraid of shareholders without heart or soul,'' said Zuazua, the board member. ''We are trying to reach the guy who understands how this club is.''

GRAPHIC: PHOTO: MACY'S THANKSGIVING DAY PARADE: (Thursday) The route is a bit different this year -- the parade will travel down a longer stretch of Avenue of the Americas to allow for a larger berth for spectators and marchers, a Macy's spokesman said -- but this 86th annual procession will keep to its tradition of high-flying balloons, high-stepping marching bands, and floats and marchers everywhere in between.

Kermit the Frog, above, just about to glide past an observer last year, will also make an appearance on Thursday, as will a new Hello Kitty and Spider-Man. The parade should last for three hours. Armchair participants -- and those stuck in the kitchen preparing the day's feast -- can follow the action on NBC. For those who want a taste of preparations for the event, balloon inflation will be open for viewing beginning Wednesday at 3 p.m. on the streets outside the American Museum of Natural History, with entry at Columbus Avenue and 79th Street. Remember: the best viewing spots on Thursday come to those who arrive early
 hot coffee may help. (Anne Mancuso) (PHOTOGRAPH BY TODD HEISLER/THE NEW YORK TIMES)

Previews and Openings
'The Anarchist' (in previews; opens on Dec. 2) If she had never sung a note in her life, Patti LuPone would have a rock-solid stage rsum, thanks in no small part to her collaborations with David Mamet. Fifteen years after starring in Mr. Mamet's ''Old Neighborhood,'' she returns in this drama as a woman who has been imprisoned for 35 years. Playing her parole adviser is Debra Winger, making her belated Broadway debut. John Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200, theanarchistbroadway.com. (Eric Grode) 
'Bare' (previews start on Monday; opens on Dec. 9) This rock musical about sexual confusion and Shakespeare in a coed Catholic boarding school has been kicking around since the Clinton administration. There was an Off Broadway run in 2004, and there have been more than 100 other productions worldwide. The subsequent success of ''Spring Awakening'' and other like-minded shows may have paved the way for this retooled version, which is directed by Stafford Arima (''Carrie'') and choreographed by Travis Wall of ''So You Think You Can Dance.'' New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, baremusicalnyc.com. (Grode)
'A Christmas Story, The Musical' (in previews; opens on Monday) The young composing team of Benj Pasek and Justin Paul took their first significant New York bow early this summer with ''Dogfight'' at Second Stage. They graduate to Broadway with this holiday show, which has a book by Joseph Robinette based on the writings of the radio humorist Jean Shepherd and the 1983 film. Set in 1940s Indiana, this musical tells the story of bespectacled Ralphie, whose one wish for Christmas is a Red Ryder BB gun. John Rando directs the production, which has proved popular in national tour dates; its Broadway cast includes Dan Lauria, John Bolton and Erin Dilly. Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, Manhattan, (877) 250-2929, achristmasstorythemusical.com, ticketmaster.com. (David Rooney)
'A Civil War Christmas' (in previews; opens on Dec. 4) You won't see boys on crutches or hear ''bah, humbug'' in this Christmas-themed 19th-century play with music. Paula Vogel, a Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright, has set her sprawling new piece on Christmas Eve 1864 and filled it with soldiers, slaves, Mary Todd Lincoln and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. Ms. Vogel and her director, Tina Landau, have also found room for period songs and traditional Christmas carols. New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 279-4200, nytw.org, ticketcentral.com. (Grode)
'Dead Accounts' (in previews; opens on Nov. 29) This new comedy from Theresa Rebeck tests the strength of family ties when a man returns to his small-town home with a suspicious amount of cash and few answers to the questions raised. The play's deluxe team includes two Tony magnets in the director Jack O'Brien and his leading man, Norbert Leo Butz, with a tasty supporting cast of Judy Greer, Josh Hamilton and Jayne Houdyshell. But the big news here is Katie Holmes: she returns to Broadway in her first starring role there, not to mention her first significant professional adventure since the tabloid storm of her divorce from Tom Cruise. Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)
'Elf' (in previews; opens on Sunday) This 2010 musical adaptation of the Will Ferrell holiday movie received some critical coal in its stocking at the time of its premiere, when Charles Isherwood, in his review for The New York Times, called it ''tinseled in synthetic sentiment'' and ''instantly forgettable.'' Undeterred, it returns for another limited holiday run, complete with a new Santa Claus: Wayne Knight, better known as Newman on ''Seinfeld.'' What, they couldn't write a Festivus musical already? Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, elfmusical.com. (Grode)
'Forever Dusty' (in previews; opens on Sunday) The jukebox-musical has now made it to Mary Isobel Catherine Bernadette O'Brien -- or, as you may know her, the English pop-soul singer Dusty Springfield. Expect to hear the likes of ''Son of a Preacher Man'' and ''You Don't Have to Say You Love Me,'' sung by Kirsten Holly Smith, who also wrote this piece with Jonathan Vankin. Randal Myler, who knows his way around jukebox musicals (''Love, Janis,'' ''Hank Williams Lost Highway''), directs. New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, stayforeverdusty.net. (Grode)
'Glengarry Glen Ross' (in previews; opens on Dec. 8) The schlubby real estate salesmen in David Mamet's masterful 1984 drama depend on a sucker being born at least every minute. With only seven years having elapsed since the last revival, let's hope new audience members are sprouting up at a comparable rate. Al Pacino, who was so memorable as the agency hotshot in the 1992 film version, graduates to the role of the old lion Shelley Levene. The newest young lion: Bobby Cannavale. Daniel Sullivan, who directed Mr. Pacino in ''The Merchant of Venice,'' takes on that task again. Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Grode)
'Golden Boy' (in previews; opens on Dec. 6) The last time the director Bartlett Sher dipped into the Clifford Odets canon for Lincoln Center Theater, the result was the soul-stirring 2006 revival of ''Awake and Sing!'' With this 75th-anniversary production of the Odets classic about a talented violinist forced to choose between music and a more lucrative career in prizefighting, Mr. Sher returns to the same stage as that earlier Tony-winning success, and also to the same theater where this play had its 1937 premiere. Alongside Seth Numrich (''War Horse'') in the title role, the large ensemble cast includes Danny Burstein, Ned Eisenberg, Jonathan Hadary, Tony Shalhoub and Yvonne Strahovski. Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)
'Golden Age' (in previews; opens on Dec. 4) Terrence McNally has had success both writing about opera (''The Lisbon Traviata,'' ''Master Class'') and writing opera himself (''Dead Man Walking''). He revisits this theme with his latest play, which is set on the opening night of Vincenzo Bellini's new opera ''I Puritani'' in 1835. Lee Pace stars as Bellini, and is joined by an array of stage regulars: Bebe Neuwirth, Lorenzo Pisoni, Will Rogers and Richard Easton. City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212, manhattantheatreclub.com. (Grode)
'Inner Voices' (in previews; opens on Sunday) Through a series of roughly biannual performances, ''Inner Voices'' has been generating an unlikely mini-genre: solo musicals written by the likes of Michael John LaChiusa and Jenny Giering. Now, for the first time, the series boasts a Pulitzer Prize-winning author: Nilo Cruz (''Anna in the Tropics''). He contributes the book and lyrics to one of this year's three pieces. Also participating are the composer Polly Pen and the versatile actor Hunter Foster. 30th Street Theater, 259 West 30th Street, Chelsea, (212) 868-4444, smarttix.com. (Grode)
'My Name Is Asher Lev' (in previews; opens on Nov. 28) Originally seen in May at the Long Wharf Theater in New Haven, this adaptation by Aaron Posner of the best-selling Chaim Potok novel was described by Anita Gates, writing in The New York Times, as ''an economical, almost painfully potent 90-minute one-act play.'' In this transfer of Gordon Edelstein's production, Ari Brand reprises the title role of a gifted young painter in postwar Brooklyn who defies the wishes of his Hasidic Jewish parents to pursue his dream of becoming an artist. Westside Theater, 407 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)
'The Piano Lesson' (in previews; opens on Sunday) Ruben Santiago-Hudson has a strong association with the plays of August Wilson. In addition to appearing in ''Gem of the Ocean'' on Broadway, he won a Tony in 1996 for his role in ''Seven Guitars,'' which he later directed as part of Signature Theater's 2006-7 season dedicated to Wilson's work. Mr. Santiago-Hudson returns to Signature to take on one of the most celebrated entries in that playwright's Century Cycle. Set in 1936 in the wake of the Great Depression, this Pulitzer-winning 1990 drama focuses on siblings at odds over what to do with their family legacy, an antique piano. Signature Center, 480 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529, signaturetheatre.org. (Rooney)
'Radiance' (in previews; opens on Friday) Set in 1955 and inspired by true events, Cusi Cram's new play follows a celebrated war hero looking to forget as he walks into a seedy bar off Hollywood Boulevard, where he meets a mysterious woman whose face transports him to the past. Suzanne Agins directs this Labyrinth Theater Company production, which features Kelly AuCoin and Ana Reeder alongside the resident players Kohl Sudduth and Aaron Roman Weiner. Bank Street Theater, 155 Bank Street, West Village, (212) 513-1080, labtheater.org. (Rooney)
'Roman Tragedies' (Friday through Sunday) Marathon theatrical extravaganzas are old hat these days. But five and a half hours of Shakespeare with no intermission? That's a new one, courtesy of the dependably daring Ivo van Hove and his company, Toneelgroep Amsterdam. At least you don't have to worry about an achy backside: During this mashup of ''Julius Caesar,'' ''Coriolanus'' and ''Antony and Cleopatra'' for the Next Wave Festival, audience members can roam among the characters, order a drink from the onstage bar or watch the action unfold on giant video screens. Howard Gilman Opera House, Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100, bam.org. (Eric Grode)
'The Twenty-Seventh Man' (in previews; opens on Sunday) Barry Edelstein directs this world premiere adaptation by Nathan Englander of his short story of the same title, set in a Soviet prison in 1952, where Stalin's secret police have rounded up 26 giants of Yiddish literature. The addition of an unknown and unpublished author to the assembled group leads them to reflect on what it means to write in troubled times. The cast includes Happy Anderson, Byron Jennings, Daniel Oreskes, Ron Rifkin, Noah Robbins and Chip Zien. Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, publictheater.org. (Rooney)
'What Rhymes With America' (previews start on Monday; opens on Dec. 12) Through a series of beguilingly off-kilter plays with short titles (''This,'' ''Suitcase,'' ''[sic]''), Melissa James Gibson has emerged over the last decade as one of Off Broadway's freshest voices. She teams up once again with the director Daniel Aukin for this latest piece, about a father and daughter separated by a closed door. The four-member cast includes the recent Tony Award nominee Da'Vine Joy Randolph (''Ghost''). Linda Gross Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 279-4200, atlantictheater.org. (Grode)
Broadway
'Annie' James Lapine's revival of the singing comic strip from 1977 is merely serviceable. But its smiley-faced mixture of hope and corn scratches an itch in a city recovering from a recession and a hurricane. Theatergoers may feel the urge both to mist up and throw up, but Lilla Crawford is a nigh irresistible Orphan Annie. With Katie Finneran and Anthony Warlow (2:25).

'Bring It On: The Musical' An A-list of musical-theater artists -- Tom Kitt (''Next to Normal''), Lin-Manuel Miranda (''In the Heights''), Jeff Whitty (''Avenue Q'') and Amanda Green -- teamed to create this featherweight concoction inspired by the cult-fave movie about rival cheerleaders. The human pyrotechnics in the cheerleading sequences are the highlight (2:15). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Charles Isherwood)
'Chaplin: The Musical' Though Rob McClure does a graceful impersonation of the title character of this soppy bio-musical, the off-screen Charlie Chaplin is often missing in action, devoured by a swarm of man-eating clichs. This gray-toned sour-smell-of-success story, featuring vaporous songs by Christopher Curtis and directed by Warren Carlyle, takes those clichs very seriously (2:30). Ethel Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Cyrano de Bergerac' Douglas Hodge (last seen in a dress in ''La Cage aux Folles'') provides an oxygenating blast of freshness in the title role of Edmond Rostand's beloved chestnut, creating a vigorous and original portrait of the swashbuckling, big-beaked poet. True, whenever he's not onstage that old ennui creeps into Jamie Lloyd's production. Fortunately, that's not all that often (2:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Brantley)
'Evita' This just in: Eva Pern is still dead. That, anyway, is on the evidence of Michael Grandage's unsmiling revival of Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice's 1978 bio-musical, which feels about as warm-blooded as a gilded mummy. Elena Roger, Michael Cerveris and Ricky Martin are the stars of this earnest combination of requiem mass and history pageant (2:30). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, Manhattan, (800) 745-3000, ticketmaster.com. (Brantley)
'Grace' Craig Wright's cool, strangulated essay of a play about forms of faith isn't as intellectually unsettling as it means to be. But the cast (which includes Paul Rudd, Ed Asner and Kate Arrington) is very good under Dexter Bullard's direction. And Michael Shannon confirms his status as our most convincing interpreter of uneasy American manhood (1:40). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'The Heiress' Masterpiece Theater on Broadway. Moiss Kaufman's revival of Ruth and Augustus Goetz's sturdy war horse, starring a one-note Jessica Chastain, is lovely to look at, easy to follow -- and aside from a vivid supporting performance from Judith Ivey -- about as full of real life as an Olde New York Christmas window in a department store (2:45). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'The Mystery of Edwin Drood' A boisterous, well-cast revival of Rupert Holmes's Tony-winning 1986 musical, which gives the audience the chance to choose the identity of the killer of the titular hero. Chita Rivera lends an air of authentic glamour, Jim Norton is a cutup as the music-hall proprietor, and the young cast sings the lovely score with great skill (2:35). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, Manhattan, (212) 719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Isherwood)
'Newsies' This Disney musical -- adapted from the 1992 movie and inspired by the newsboy strike of 1899 -- markets Urchin Appeal with extra! extra! enthusiasm. Jeff Calhoun directs a cast of comely, if overgrown, ragamuffins. The largely interchangeable songs are by Alan Menken and Jack Feldman (2:20). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, Manhattan, (866) 870-2717, newsiesthemusical.com. (Brantley)
'Nice Work if You Can Get It' Every now and then a bubble of pure, tickling charm rises from the artificial froth of this pastiche 1920s musical, directed by Kathleen Marshall and featuring songs by George and Ira Gershwin. But mostly the production, starring Matthew Broderick and Kelli O'Hara, registers as a shiny, dutiful trickle of gags and production numbers (2:30). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Once' This gentle musical, set in Dublin, about a love affair that never quite happens -- based on the 2006 movie -- inventively uses songs (by Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova) and dance to convey a beautiful shimmer of might-have-been regret. Staged by John Tiffany and Steven Hoggett (''Black Watch''), the production stars the immensely appealing Steve Kazee and Cristin Milioti (2:15). Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Peter and the Starcatcher' The most exhilarating and inventive example of story theater since the Royal Shakespeare Company's ''Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby.'' This production, about the boy who became Peter Pan, is an enchanted anatomy of the urge to defy gravity. Roger Rees and Alex Timbers direct (2:10).

&#x2605; 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?' Pam MacKinnon's shattering 50th-anniversary revival of Edward Albee's hair-raising drama of marital discord stars an electrifying Tracy Letts (of ''August: Osage County'' fame) as George and Amy Morton (ditto) as Martha, ably supported by Carrie Coon and Madison Dirks as the young couple they use as cannon fodder.

Off Broadway
'Bad Jews' The wonderful Tracee Chimo (''Circle Mirror Tranformation,'' ''Bachelorette'') gives a sensational performance in Joshua Harmon's play, portraying a smart, funny and seriously abrasive young woman who is embroiled in a dispute with her cousin over who is entitled to a family heirloom (1:40).

'A Celebration of Harold Pinter' Julian Sands bravely takes on the voice of Pinter the poet in a modest, affecting production that looks for the private person within the artist. By the evening's end, the show, directed by John Malkovich, has also become a celebration of the actor's craft (1:45). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737, irishrep.org. (Brantley)
'Checkers' Though briskly paced and attractively packaged, Douglas McGrath's play about a beleaguered young Richard Nixon often seems to float in stylistic limbo, between two or three dimensions. Terry Kinney directs an accomplished cast led by Anthony LaPaglia in the title role and Kathryn Erbe, who brings startling emotional heft to the role of Pat Nixon (1:45). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 353-0303, vineyardtheatre.org. (Brantley)
'Cougar the Musical' Three older women find themselves attracted to younger men, two against their better judgment. The concept seems made for bus tours, but imagination, appealing numbers with original melodies and theme-transcending jokes lift this show well above the level of ''Menopause: The Musical'' and its ilk (1:30).

&#x2605; 'Disgraced' A stimulating, eloquent and bitingly funny new play by Ayad Akhtar about a corporate lawyer of Muslim origins (the excellent Aasif Mandvi of ''The Daily Show'') whose well-heeled life begins to unravel when he becomes involved in a court case involving an unjustly jailed imam (1:20).

'Dispatches From (A)mended America' Brandt Adams and Godfrey L. Simmons Jr. interviewed 100 Southerners about race following the 2008 election of President Obama. Their efforts yielded a smattering of interesting ideas, but the authors have crowded out these thoughts with their own musings. And so a noble, potentially enlightening exercise becomes a self-indulgent duet with 100 backup singers.

'Emotional Creature' This collage of songs, monologues and spoken-word pieces by Eve Ensler explore the problems facing young women around the globe, from sex-slavery to the plague of mean girls.

'Falling' The Martin family, in Deanna Jent's compact play, is trying to live a normal life despite the outsize presence of their severely autistic son, Josh (effectively portrayed by Daniel Everidge). When a Bible-toting grandmother visits, the emotional temperature rises, and with it Josh's potential for violence. Despite some implausible stacking of the dramatic deck by the playwright, ''Falling'' makes some sound points and invites further investigation into the disorder (1:15). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (800) 982-2787, ticketmaster.com. (Andy Webster)
&#x2605; 'Figaro' The playwright Charles Morey rescues Pierre-Augustin Caron de Beaumarchais's late-18th-century comedy ''The Marriage of Figaro'' from the shadow of its more celebrated operatic incarnation with this witty new adaptation for the Pearl Theater Company, inaugurating the classical troupe's new home on West 42nd Street. Directed with a light touch and an infectious wink by Hal Brooks, the farce takes aim at ruling-class entitlement just as surely today as it did in pre-Revolution France. The energetic ensemble is led by Sean McNall and Jolly Abraham as the crafty servant Figaro and his bride-to-be, and Chris Mixon as the lascivious Count determined to get a piece of pre-wedding action (2:10). Pearl Theater, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 563-9261, pearltheatre.org. (Rooney)
'5 Lesbians Eating a Quiche' This frolicsome play, about a women's club in 1956, ventures into such heady excesses of absurdism, it deserves to be called Mama-ist. (Dada wouldn't do at all.) As written by Evan Linder and Andrew Hobgood, with Sarah Gitenstein directing, ''Quiche'' takes a giant leap from punning smirkiness into the outer space of nonsense (1:15). SoHo Playhouse, 15 Van Dam Street, South Village, sohoplayhouse.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Forbidden Broadway: Alive and Kicking' Gerard Alessandrini's essential satirical cheat sheet to Broadway musicals returns after a three-year absence, packing polished brass knuckles. A precisionist cast of four provides vocal cartoons as evocative as Al Hirschfeld's caricatures. This show not only tickles but also pierces the Achilles' heels of the productions under scrutiny (1:40). At the 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'The Freedom of the City' The masterful contemporary Irish dramatist Brian Friel puts a human face on the Troubles in Northern Ireland with this stirring drama from 1973 about the shooting by British soldiers of three nonviolent civilian protesters at a march, which echoes the tragic events of Bloody Sunday the year before. Staged by Ciaran O'Reilly with a firm handle on the narrative's time-shuffling structure and a stinging clarity that illuminates the play's multiple perspectives, this drama steadily tightens its grip, from its absorbing beginnings through to its shattering conclusion. The standout among the generally solid cast is Cara Seymour as a stubbornly optimistic housewife and mother of 11 children, living in two rooms with a useless husband and no running water (2:00). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737, irishrep.org. (Rooney)
&#x2605; 'Fried Chicken and Latkes' Rain Pryor, the daughter of the comedian Richard Pryor (who died in 2005), stars in this effervescent solo show, which recounts her upbringing in a biracial household (her mother is Jewish) in Beverly Hills, Calif. Ms. Pryor, who sings and portrays a range of characters (including, poignantly, her father in a spot-on impression) is an ebullient performer with a robust singing voice. She lives in Baltimore now, but her outsize personality is built for Broadway (1:30). Actor's Temple Theater, 339 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Webster)
'Golden Child' The first production in the Signature Theater's season devoted to the work of David Henry Hwang is a revival of his 1996 play about a family in early-20th-century China grappling with the encroaching ideals of the West. Juliana Soelistyo, who starred in the original production as the young woman whose bound feet become a bone of contention, is a standout as the sternest and most recalcitrant of the three wives in the family (2:00). Signature Center, 480 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529, signaturetheatre.org. (Isherwood)
'If There Is I Haven't Found It Yet' Jake Gyllenhaal makes a very creditable New York stage debut as the stoner uncle of a troubled 15-year-old girl (Annie Funke) in Nick Payne's earnest, shaggy (and conceptually overwrought) story of global warming and domestic meltdown. Michael Longhurst directs a cast rounded out by Brian F. O'Byrne and Michelle Gomez (1:35).

'Ivanov' Boredom comes in many flavors in Chekhov's early study of provincial lives, and darned if Austin Pendleton's production doesn't provide a different acting style for each one. The lusty comic energy of the show's first half peters out in the second. Ethan Hawke strips the gears of suffering in the title role; Joely Richardson is superb as his neglected wife (3:00). Classic Stage Company, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (866) 811-4111, classicstage.org. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Mies Julie' The temperature never stops rising in Yael Farber's blistering drama, which resets Strindberg's ''Miss Julie'' in contemporary South Africa. But be advised: This is a fire that chills as it destroys. Hilda Cronje and Bongile Mantsai give full-immersion performances as the doomed lovers whose very identities come under siege. Ms. Farber directs, compellingly and mercilessly (1:30). St. Ann's Warehouse, 29 Jay Street, at Plymouth Street, Dumbo, Brooklyn, (718) 254-8779, stannswarehouse.org. (Brantley)
'Old Jews Telling Jokes' With old jokes, a few songs and a little schmaltz, this winning revue is simple, effective entertainment executed with obvious affection (1:20). Westside Theater, 407 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Jason Zinoman)

&#x2605; 'Sorry' Set on Nov. 6, 2012 (Election Day), Richard Nelson's play -- the third in his Apple family series -- is about as big and as small as a domestic drama can be. Acted by a wonderful cast of five, ''Sorry'' keeps us aware of how every seemingly insignificant detail in one family's life is infused by a much larger picture (1:45). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, publictheater.org. (Brantley)
'A Summer Day' In her first New York stage appearance in more than a decade, Karen Allen is perfectly cast as a woman frozen in time in Jon Fosse's quietly brutal play, which turns a romantic clich into an existential life sentence. Sarah Cameron Sunde adapted and directs this minimalist Norwegian work, which exerts an eerie dramatic undertow (1:20). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, West Village, (866) 811-4111, rattlestick.org. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Tribes' Nina Raine's smart, lively and beautifully acted play asks us to hear how we hear, in silence as well as speech. This British import considers the passive and aggressive forms of listening within an insular, intellectual family, whose members include a deaf son. David Cromer is the expert director (2:15). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 868-4444, smarttix.com. (Brantley)
'Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike' Nomenclature would seem to be fate for the title characters of Christopher Durang's sunny comedy about gloomy people. David Hyde Pierce, Kristine Nielsen and Sigourney Weaver portray three siblings (if not three sisters) whose parents burdened them with Chekovian names. Nicholas Martin directs this surprisingly mild-mannered work from a savage satirist (2:30). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'The Whale' The gentle giant at the heart of Samuel D.

'Be Careful! The Sharks Will Eat You!' (closes on Sunday) In his one-man show, Jay Alvarez recounts his family's escape from Cuba in 1964, when he was just 4. Acting at least a half-dozen roles, Mr. Alvarez is an evocative taleteller when reliving the yearlong plans his father made that delivered as many as 30 refugees by boat to the United States. Despite the title, though, and to the play's disadvantage, he describes almost nothing of the 30-hour voyage itself (1:30). Stage Left Studio, 214 West 30th Street, Manhattan, stageleftstudio.net.

'Billy Witch' (closes on Saturday) In this gleeful romp from Gregory S.

'Coney' (closes on Saturday) Not every dramatic conceit soars in David Johnston's elegiac love letter to Coney Island, which weaves interconnected stories about employees and habitus on the boardwalk.

'Cotton Club Parade' (closes on Sunday) When this revue-style salute to Duke Ellington's run at the Cotton Club had its premiere last November, Stephen Holden of The New York Times called it a ''thrilling 90-minute celebration'' and singled out the efforts of the singer Adriane Lenox and the tap dancer Jared Grimes. They're both back for another brief run, and joining them and the Jazz at Lincoln Center All Stars band is the ''Glee'' star Amber Riley.

'An Enemy of the People' (closes on Sunday) Boyd Gaines gives a forceful performance as Dr. Stockmann, the champion of truth who takes a principled stand against forces led by his brother, Peter (a sinister Richard Thomas), in Ibsen's meaty but talky drama about corruption in a Norwegian spa town. Doug Hughes's production features fine performances but cannot always overcome the play's sometimes heavy-handed dramaturgy (2:00). Samuel J.

'Home / Sick' (closes on Sunday) The Assembly, a cutting-edge young theater collective, has painstakingly researched the Weather Underground, a violent and polyamorous Vietnam-era guerrilla group. Jess Chayes's intense and thoughtful direction guides us through two decades of the group's history, focusing on its infamous bombings of government buildings and banks (and once, by accident, itself). There's also a lot of sloganeering, pot-smoking, orgying and, inevitably, self-destruction. By the end we have witnessed a sort of sociological big bang, when this tight, angry ball of political energy suddenly bursts and disbands irreparably (1:20).

Presented by Making Books Sing in conjunction with the Louis Armstrong House Museum and the Aaron Copland School of Music at Queens College, this musical for family audiences -- though it's just as entertaining for adults -- features live jazz and a tour de force performance by Jeremy Giraud Abram in the title role. Written by Myla Churchill, it highlights Armstrong's civil rights activism at the time of the desegregation of Central High School in Little Rock, Ark., in 1957 (1:00).

HEADLINE: The Normals

BYLINE: By DANIEL M. GOLD

 BODY:
In ''The Normals'' Billy Schine, in his 20s, unemployed and not sure what to do with his life, avoids a debt collector by entering a two-week clinical trial of an antipsychotic treatment at a drug-testing center in Queens. Between the taking of pills, the drawing of blood, the poking and prodding and interviews, he and his fellow ''normals'' -- among them a professional ''trial-tester''; an egomaniacal actor; a troubled, confused Bible reader; an attractive, provocative young woman -- battle tedium and irritate one another. It's like high school, without the dance. 
The film, adapted by Chris Ciancimino from the novel by David Gilbert, is a mixed bag. Most of the characters are cartoons. As Billy, Bryan Greenberg is too unflappable, except when he's too excitable. But Josh Pais as the supervising doctor is good, a harried blend of boredom, skittishness and medical malpractice. And in bit parts John Sayles and Dan Hedaya elevate their brief time on screen.
Directing his first feature with a heavy hand, Kevin Connors seems as though he doesn't trust the audience. The satire -- about religion, medicine, TV culture -- is larded unevenly, the homage overly obvious. The pill-dispensing routines, for example, are enough to invoke ''One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.'' You don't need dialogue from its basketball-court scenes too.
The film does capture the soul-deadening quality of ward life and its antiseptic, colorless isolation. Well before the end of ''The Normals'' Billy craves a return to the world. He's not the only one.
Opens on Friday in Manhattan. Directed by Kevin Connors 1 hour 30 minutes; not rated

HEADLINE: Health Fund Sees Changes, Not All of Them Welcomed

BYLINE: By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.

 BODY:
Major changes erupted at one of the world's leading health-funding agencies Thursday as it hired a new director, dismissed the inspector general who had clashed with a previous director and announced a new approach to making grants.
Dr. Mark Dybul, the Bush administration's global AIDS czar who was abruptly dismissed when President Obama took office, was named the new executive director of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. 
Dr. Dybul, who was selected over candidates from Canada, Britain and France, was backed by the United States, which donates about a third of the fund's budget, and by Bill Gates, who helped the fund through a cash crisis earlier this year.
He is respected by many AIDS activists in the United States, though there is some lingering controversy about his time in the Bush administration related to abstinence policies and anti-prostitution pledges imposed by conservative lawmakers as well as concerning strict licensing requirements for generic drugs.
The fund, which is based in Geneva and has given away more than $20 billion since its founding in 2002, has been in crisis for more than a year. Some donors shied away after widely publicized corruption scandals, while others, notably Mr. Gates, said the scandals were exaggerated and increased donations.
Its last executive director, Dr. Michel Kazatchkine, quit in January after the day-to-day management duties of his job were given to a Brazilian banker, Gabriel Jaramillo, who was charged with cutting expenses.
By some accounts, 40 percent of the employees soon left, although Seth Faison, a fund spokesman, said the total number of employees declined by only 8 percent. The fund also dismissed its inspector general, John Parsons, on Thursday, citing unsatisfactory work.
Mr. Parsons and Dr. Kazatchkine had privately clashed. Mr. Parsons's teams aggressively pursued theft and fraud, and found it in Mali, Mauritania and elsewhere. But the total amount stolen -- $10 million to $20 million -- was relatively small, and aides to Dr. Kazatchkine said the fund cut off those countries and sought to retrieve the money. The aides claimed that Mr. Parsons, who reported only to the board, went to news outlets and left the impression that the fund was covering up rampant theft.
The fuss scared off some donor countries that were already looking for excuses to cut back on foreign aid because of the global economic crisis.
Mr. Parsons did not return messages left for him Thursday.
Dr. Dybul's appointment was welcomed by the United Nations AIDS program, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation, Malaria No More and Results.org, an anti-poverty lobbying group. By contrast, Jamie Love, an American advocate for cheaper AIDS drugs who works in Washington and Geneva, said he expected Dr. Dybul ''to protect drug companies.''
The fund also announced a new application process, which it said would be faster and focus more on the hardest-hit countries rather than all 150 that received some help in the past.
In an interview, Dr. Dybul said he felt the fund was ''on a strong forward trajectory'' after changes were put in place in the last year by Mr. Jaramillo, and now would focus on ''hard-nosed implementation of value for money.''
Both the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief and the fund spend billions, but in different ways.
The fund supports projects proposed by national health ministers and then hires local auditors to make sure the money is not wasted or stolen. Pepfar usually gives grants to American nonprofit groups or medical schools and lets them form partnerships with hospitals or charities in the affected countries.
The conventional wisdom is that the Global Fund's model is more likely to win the cooperation of government officials but more vulnerable to corruption -- and also spends less on salaries and travel for American overseers.
Dr. Kazatchkine said he did not expect Dr. Dybul to ''Pepfarize'' the Global Fund.
''I hope that, after a year of turbulence, the fund finds the serenity needed to move forward again,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Senate 'Gang of 8' Says This Isn't Its Moment in Deficit Talks

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEISMAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- After years of wrangling, members of the bipartisan group of senators known as the Gang of Eight are ratcheting back expectations for a deficit reduction breakthrough and now say the best they can probably do is offer ideas for the one fiscal negotiation that will truly matter: talks between President Obama and Speaker John A. Boehner that begin in earnest on Friday.
Another fruitless meeting this week of the Senate group has only raised the pressure ahead of the White House session between the president and Congressional leaders. ''It was great. We had a lot of doughnuts,'' said Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the Senate's second-ranking Democrat and the most powerful member of the gang, which was once seen as the best hope for a budget deal that could draw support from both parties. 
Other ad hoc efforts seem to be languishing as well. Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, said after circulating a deficit plan a year in the making, that it was solely up to the president and the speaker to stop the country from careening over the so-called fiscal cliff.
Senator Michael Bennet, Democrat of Colorado, who has been negotiating with Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, said it was time to squelch such side negotiations, lest they undermine Mr. Obama and Mr. Boehner.
''There's eight individuals, well meaning and trying to get a deal, and it shows you how hard it is,'' Senator Tom Coburn, Republican of Oklahoma and an original member of the Gang of Eight, said of the apparent impasse. ''And it's gotten harder after the election. As you might imagine, positions have hardened.''
Such freelance negotiations were once seen as a bottom-up way to push leaders on Capitol Hill and in the White House toward the political center, where they could compromise on a sweeping deficit reduction package. The self-appointed gang once put itself forward as the architects of a ''grand bargain'' to save the nation from fiscal and economic crisis.
But, Mr. Bennet said, time has run out. Now lawmakers from both parties say they need a solution imposed from the top.
''We want to find a way to avoid the cliff, and the focus of this effort is going to be between the president and John Boehner,'' Mr. Durbin said. ''It is possible that some of the ideas we come up with may be of value in that conversation.''
On Friday Mr. Obama will meet with Mr. Boehner; Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader; Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, to begin deficit negotiations formally. White House officials say Mr. Obama is likely to extend another invitation for next week, after he returns from a trip to Asia and before Thanksgiving.
If no agreement is reached, hundreds of billions of dollars in simultaneous tax increases and across-the-board spending cuts will begin in January. Economists say that sudden jolt would be likely to send the economy back into recession.
''At this point, the president and the speaker, the other leaders, are going to be meeting at the White House, and I think the focus needs to be on those meetings,'' said Senator Michael D. Crapo, Republican of Idaho and another member of the gang. ''And although there are many other discussions working on trying to help find a path forward here, I don't think that we need to be looking at other options in terms of the decision-making process right now.''
Senators involved in the negotiations do not want a repeat of last summer, when they were blamed in part for the collapse of the last set of deficit talks between the president and the speaker. Those negotiations appeared to be heading toward a deal in July 2011 when the framework of a Senate ''gang'' agreement emerged, promising $1.2 trillion in revenue increases, 50 percent more than the $800 billion that Mr. Obama and Mr. Boehner were homing in on. Suddenly the president faced the prospect of agreeing to the lower figure with the speaker, then facing a revolt from his own party. Republicans say the White House demanded more tax increases, Mr. Boehner balked, and talks collapsed.
Senate negotiators say officially that efforts to find a broad, bipartisan debt plan continue, but frustration is starting to show. The original Gang of Six -- augmented by two new members, Mr. Bennet and Senator Mike Johanns, Republican of Nebraska -- met for three days in Mount Vernon, Va., in October, but little progress was made.
They reconvened on Tuesday, but the election results presented a new set of problems. Republican officials familiar with the talks say Democrats dug in on demands for tax revenue that Republicans are not willing to meet. Democratic aides say Republicans who had spoken abstractly about the need for more revenues are balking at the specifics.
''Things change. It's not just a matter of the numbers changing, and they do,'' Mr. Durbin said of shifting deficit projections, revenue forecasts and spending totals. ''It's also a matter of the political environment, and the landscape changing.''
Democrats freely admit they have shifted their stance from the defensive crouch of the summer of 2011, when they signed on to a budget deal that cut $1 trillion in spending with no tax increases, to now, when they believe the voters have given them a mandate to raise taxes on the affluent.
''We were in damage limitation mode. Now we're in full problem-solving mode,'' said Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, the senior Democrat on the House Budget Committee.
Both sides insist they want a deal before January, but a rising chorus of voices, especially Democrats, say they would rather go over the cliff than accept a deal that raised too few taxes while extracting too many cuts, especially to Medicare and Medicaid.
The search for a deal before January is off to a slow start. Rob Nabors, the president's chief liaison to Congress, came to the Capitol early this week to meet with Mr. Boehner's chief of staff, Mike Sommers. But little groundwork was done ahead of Friday's meeting.
Some Republican House aides suggested that Mr. Obama was trying to raise the pressure on Republicans with his lackadaisical approach ahead of a trip to Asia and a Thanksgiving break. True negotiations, they say, will not begin until December, just weeks before the deadline.

HEADLINE: Taxpayers Face Rescue Of F.H.A.

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Federal Housing Administration, a government agency that insures mortgages, is on the verge of requiring taxpayer financing for the first time in its eight-decade history. 
An independent audit to be released on Friday projects that the administration will not have the cash reserves to pay all of its obligations, with the total shortfall amounting to about $16.3 billion.
''This does not mean F.H.A. has insufficient cash to pay insurance claims, a current operating deficit or will need to immediately draw funds from the Treasury,'' the report stressed.
But it does make a taxpayer bailout likely. Reserves at the administration, which insures more than $1 trillion in mortgages, fell to below $3 billion last year. And the report cites a number of weaknesses on the agency's books.
''We will continue to take aggressive steps to protect F.H.A.'s financial health while ensuring that F.H.A. continues to perform its historic role of providing access to homeownership for underserved communities and supporting the housing market during tough economic times,'' said Carol J. Galante, its acting commissioner, in a statement.
The F.H.A. ''has weathered the storm of the recent economic and housing crisis by taking the most aggressive and sweeping actions in its history to reform risk management, credit policy, lender enforcement and consumer protections,'' Shaun Donovan, the secretary of housing and urban development, said in a statement.
Politicians in Washington, particularly Republicans, have voiced concerns that the agency could become a drain on the taxpayer, much like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Those two mortgage finance giants have not required additional taxpayer funding in recent quarters, as the housing market has stabilized. But they have nevertheless received about $190 billion in federal financing in the last four years.
An agency release cites three reasons for its deteriorating financial position. Home prices have not risen as quickly as the administration's actuaries expected. Low interest rates have weakened its books. The agency's independent actuary used a ''refined methodology this year to more precisely predict'' its losses.
More broadly, the agency is still struggling from the burst of the real estate bubble. By many measures, housing prices have only recently started to stabilize and increase. The rate of foreclosures remains high.
The agency's books are improving, a release said. But it noted that its portfolio of loans insured between 2007 and 2009 -- after the housing bubble started to collapse -- were placing a ''significant'' strain on its finances. The independent actuaries project more than $70 billion in losses on those loans.

HEADLINE: Report Faults MF Global Regulators

BYLINE: By BEN PROTESS and MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED; Ben Protess reported from Washington and Michael J. de la Merced from New York.

 BODY:
9:26 p.m. | Updated
WASHINGTON - When MF Global was on the brink of collapse, chaos and confusion spread not only among the firm's executives in New York, but also among its regulators in Washington, according to a report released on Thursday.
In the final hectic hours before the brokerage firm's bankruptcy more than a year ago, regulators at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission instructed MF Global to transfer $220 million to plug a hole in customer accounts. The firm agreed - over the objections of the Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulators.
Upon learning of the futures commission's orders, the chairwoman of the S.E.C., Mary L. Schapiro, responded in an e-mail to a colleague: "Without telling us? That is unacceptable."
The e-mails of regulators, cited in an "autopsy" report from Republican members of the House Financial Services Committee's oversight panel, portray a "disorganized and haphazard" approach to oversight from an alphabet soup of federal agencies. The regulators, the Republicans said, struggled to communicate even as MF Global was reeling. 
The 100-page report, which some Democrats dismissed as a sort of public shaming of Obama administration watchdogs, further traced the MF Global debacle to the firm's top executives. Republicans placed blame on the former chief executive, Jon S. Corzine, a onetime Democratic senator and governor of New Jersey, who they said increased a bet on European debt without regard for internal controls or the danger to clients.
Rather than rein in his risk-taking, Republicans said that regulators afforded Mr. Corzine a long leash.
"We didn't need additional regulation. We needed regulators actually doing their job," Representative Randy Neugebauer, a Republican from Texas who led the investigation as chairman of the oversight panel, said at a news conference on Thursday.
Citing "an apparent inability" of the regulators to coordinate their actions, Republicans suggested that investors and customers would be better served if the S.E.C. and the futures commission streamlined their operations or combined into a single agency.
But that proposition is fraught with political peril. Lawmakers have sought to merge the two agencies for decades, only to scuttle the plans in the face of opposition. The Senate and House agriculture committees - clinging to the power and campaign donations that come with overseeing the futures commission - are often the first to object.
After the financial crisis, as lawmakers debated the Dodd-Frank regulatory overhaul, federal authorities again put forward the idea of combining the agencies. But legislators reached a bipartisan consensus that such a change would spread confusion at a time when the financial industry was barely back on its feet.
On Thursday, federal officials were skeptical of the House panel's suggestions. While some top S.E.C. and Congressional officials say they support a merger, others doubt it is politically feasible unless another crisis erupts. One Congressional aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity dismissed the House panel's recommendation as a "power grab."
In a somewhat surprising move, Republicans released the report without the support of House Democrats. On Wednesday, the oversight panel's top Democrat, Representative Michael Capuano of Massachusetts, declined to endorse the Republicans' findings, saying that while he agreed with a number of the conclusions, he needed additional time to review the document. Mr. Capuano said he would soon file an addendum to the report.
The report, the outgrowth of several Congressional hearings with MF Global's executives and other officials, is the culmination of a yearlong investigation that sought to chronicle the firm's undoing and rebuke those at fault. The House panel's findings stemmed from dozens of interviews with former employees and more than 240,000 documents.
The report leveled some of its harshest criticism on regulatory agencies, which it blamed for breakdowns in communication.
Two days before the collapse of the firm, top S.E.C. officials joked about three regulatory conference calls all being scheduled for 10 a.m. "Ahhhh, coordination in action!" Ms. Schapiro, the S.E.C., chairwoman, wrote in an e-mail. (People briefed on the matter insisted that the calls were meant to coordinate efforts among regulators on different continents regarding a number of matters.)
The House panel also noted that one senior regulator "wished" the S.E.C. would have informed other authorities about plans to impose higher capital requirements on MF Global in the early summer of 2011. A spokesman for the S.E.C., John Nester, said in a statement that the agency notified the C.F.T.C. about its plans in August, about two months after the issue first arose.
Futures commission officials declined to comment.
The report further scolded the C.F.T.C. for not informing other regulators that MF Global was using an obscure loophole to tap customer accounts. In an interview with the House panel, an S.E.C. official said the loophole allowed the firm to use its customer accounts as an "A.T.M."
The report also took aim at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Republicans argued that the New York Fed "should have exercised greater caution" when approving MF Global's application for the coveted status of selling securities on the Fed's behalf.
But much of the report's criticism was trained on Mr. Corzine, who resisted efforts to curb his authority over the European trades.
The chief executive pushed back against demands by the firm's auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers, that the company account for its sovereign debt holdings in a way that would have reduced its profitability, according to the report.
And when MF Global's chief risk officer argued that the European bet had grown too big, Mr. Corzine effectively stripped the executive of the ability to check that trade. Oversight of Mr. Corzine's trading was eventually delegated to the firm's board, which tended to support its chairman.
The panel's report also suggested that MF Global executives painted a darker picture of the firm's health in private. Despite assuring investors during a public earnings call in late October that executives "feel good" about the brokerage firm's finances, one executive described a major unit as being "currently unable to fund itself" in an internal e-mail.
No one at MF Global has been accused of wrongdoing.
While lacking a full bipartisan endorsement, the document is the most significant government effort yet to address MF Global's errors.
Authorities investigating MF Global's collapse are leery of filing criminal charges against the top executives, suspecting that chaos and lax controls - not criminality - resulted in customer money going missing. And while regulators are still pursuing civil enforcement actions, in which the burden of proof is less, officials have not yet decided to act.
MF Global's customers remain in the lurch. Farmers and ranchers, who traded futures contracts through MF Global to protect themselves from the price swings of their crops, have recovered about 82 percent of their money but are still owed millions of dollars.
James W. Giddens, the court-appointed trustee seeking to recover $1.6 billion for MF Global's customers, has joined a lawsuit against several top MF Global executives, including Mr. Corzine.
"Please do not get the impression that these people will be made whole," said Spencer Bachus, an Alabama Republican who oversees the full House financial committee. "These are real people. This is not just a number."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

 BODY:
HOUSTON -- BP, the British oil company, said on Thursday that it had agreed to pay $4.5 billion in fines and other penalties and to plead guilty to 14 criminal charges related to the rig explosion two years ago that killed 11 people and caused a giant oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.
In a rare instance of seeking to hold individuals accountable for company misdeeds, the Justice Department also filed criminal charges against three BP employees in connection with the accident.
''This is unprecedented, both with regard to the amounts of money, the fact that a company has been criminally charged and that individuals have been charged as well,'' Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said at a news conference in New Orleans to announce the settlement. 
The government said that BP's negligence in sealing an exploratory well caused it to explode, sinking the Deepwater Horizon drill rig and unleashing a gusher of oil that lasted for months and coated beaches all along the Gulf Coast. The company initially tried to cover up the severity of the spill, misleading both Congress and investors about how quickly oil was leaking from the runaway well, according to the settlement and related charges.
While the settlement dispels one dark cloud that has hovered over BP since the spill, it does not resolve what is potentially the largest penalty related to the incident: the company could owe as much as $21 billion in pollution fines under the Clean Water Act f it is found to have been grossly negligent. Both the government and BP vowed to vigorously contest that issue at a trial scheduled to begin in February.
Under its deal with the Justice Department, BP will pay about $4 billion in penalties over five years. That amount includes $1.256 billion in criminal fines, $2.394 billion to the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation for remediation efforts and $350 million to the National Academy of Sciences. The criminal fine is one of the largest levied by the United States against a corporation.
BP also agreed to pay $525 million to settle civil charges by the Securities and Exchange Commission that it misled investors about the flow rate of oil from the well.
In addition, the company will submit to four years of government monitoring of its safety practices and ethics.
''All of us at BP deeply regret the tragic loss of life caused by the Deepwater Horizon accident, as well as the impact of the spill on the Gulf Coast region,'' Robert W. Dudley, BP's chief executive, said in a statement. ''We apologize for our role in the accident, and as today's resolution with the U.S. government further reflects, we have accepted responsibility for our actions.''
A broader settlement that would have resolved the Clean Water Act claims failed to win agreement from some parties, in particular the state of Louisiana. BP and the government now intend to go to trial on those claims in February.
The government charged the top BP officers aboard the drilling rig, Robert Kaluza and Donald Vidrine, with manslaughter in connection with each man who died, contending that the officials were negligent in supervising tests to seal the well.
Prosecutors also charged David Rainey, BP's former vice president for exploration in the Gulf of Mexico, with obstruction of Congress and making false statements for understating the rate at which oil was spilling from the well.
As part of its plea agreement, BP admitted that, through Mr. Rainey, it withheld documents and provided false and misleading information in response to the House of Representatives' request for information on how quickly oil was flowing. While Mr. Rainey was publicly repeating BP's stated estimate of 5,000 barrels of oil a day, the company's engineering teams were using sophisticated methods that generated significantly higher estimates. The Flow Rate Technical Group, consisting of government and independent scientists, later concluded that more than 60,000 barrels a day were leaking into the gulf during that time.
Lawyers for all three men charged denied that their clients had committed any criminal wrongdoing.
''This is not justice,'' Mr. Kaluza's lawyers, Shaun Clarke and David Gerger, said in a statement. ''After nearly three years and tens of millions of dollars in investigation, the government needs a scapegoat.''
Mr. Holder, the attorney general, said that the government's investigation was continuing and that other criminal charges could be filed.
Under the settlement announced on Thursday, BP agreed to plead guilty to 11 felony counts of misconduct or neglect related to the deaths in the explosion. The company pleaded guilty to one misdemeanor violation of the Clean Water Act and one misdemeanor violation of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. It also agreed to plead guilty to one felony count of obstruction of Congress over its statements about the flow rate.
Shelley Anderson, whose husband, Jason, died in the Deepwater Horizon disaster, said she was happy to hear about the settlement. ''I think it's a good thing that BP has owned up to their responsibility,'' she said.
But Ms. Anderson said the agreement did not change her own situation. ''Everybody has asked about closure, closure, closure,'' she said. ''It's not necessarily closure for us, because we still live every single day. We get up every single day and do it again. Life goes on.''
BP has repeatedly said it would like to reach a settlement of all claims against it if the terms were reasonable. The unresolved claims have been weighing on the company's share price.
On Thursday, BP's American shares closed at $40.30, up slightly on the day and down about 34 percent since the accident.
The settlement is ''one less thing to be negative on BP about and a minor step in the right direction toward the rehabilitation of BP,'' said Iain Armstrong, an equity analyst at the investment manager Brewin Dolphin in London. But he added that there were still concerns about the remaining claims, and that ''lawyers might yet have their day at court.''
As part of Thursday's announcement, BP said it was increasing its reserve for costs and claims related to the spill to about $42 billion.
Brian Gilvary, BP's chief financial officer, said in a conference call with analysts that the board weighed the settlement struck with the government against the prospect of a much wider criminal indictment that would have involved more people in the company. ''A criminal indictment would have been a huge distraction,'' he said.
BP said that before Thursday's announced payments, it spent more than $14 billion on operational response and cleanup costs and $1 billion on early restoration projects, and paid out more than $9 billion to individuals, businesses and government entities.
In March, BP agreed with the lawyers for plaintiffs to settle claims of economic loss, including from the local seafood industry, and medical claims stemming from the oil spill. The company said it expected that settlement to be an additional $7.8 billion, which it will pay from a trust it set aside to cover such costs.
Until this week, the only BP employee to be arrested and indicted was a low-level engineer, Kurt Mix, who has been charged with obstruction of justice for deleting text messages about company estimates of the flow rate from the spill. The government has asserted that in October 2010, Mr. Mix, of Katy, Tex., deleted from his smartphone a string of more than 200 messages with a supervisor about the flow rate estimated at the time of a failed effort to contain the spill. He is also accused of deleting a second string of messages with a contractor in August 2011.
Mr. Mix has pleaded not guilty to both counts of impeding a grand jury investigation, saying that the deletions were routine and that other records of the communications still existed.
David Yarnold, chief executive of the National Audubon Society, said Thursday's settlement ''matches the unprecedented offense BP committed.''
''But BP needs to compensate the Gulf Coast in the form of civil damages,'' he said. ''The rule has to be: You break it, you buy it.''
The company could still face billions of dollars in penalties under the Oil Pollution Act or the Clean Water Act. This possibility has spurred political jockeying between the Obama administration and Gulf Coast politicians who want to maximize the amount of money the states receive to help local communities affected by the spill.
Under the Clean Water Act, fines could range from $1,100 for every barrel spilled through simple negligence to as much as $4,300 a barrel if the company were found to have been grossly negligent. With an estimated 4.9 million barrels of oil spilled in the accident, the company faces liabilities of as much as $5.4 billion to $21 billion.
Gulf Coast lawmakers passed legislation called the Restore Act last summer under which 80 percent of fines paid by BP under the Clean Water Act would go to gulf communities.
The Justice Department could also levy fines under a provision of the Oil Pollution Act, in which case BP would face a bigger penalty -- more than $31 billion -- to repair damages. But BP would be allowed to take a tax deduction for damages paid, and federal agencies would control how the fine money was spent.
While the government will no longer be able to hold the threat of criminal charges over BP in negotiations about a civil fine, its quiver is not empty.
Brandon L. Garrett, a law professor at the University of Virginia who studies corporate prosecutions, said the government could still invoke the threat of ''debarment,'' or disqualification from getting federal contracts. Although debarment is rare, he said, ''that could be a very large blow both to reputation and to business BP does with the federal government.''
Two other companies involved in the Gulf of Mexico accident, the rig operator Transocean and the cement contractor Halliburton, also face potential civil and criminal liabilities.
Representative Ed Markey, the Massachusetts Democrat who was chairman of the House committee that received false information from BP about the spill rate in 2010, said: ''The Obama administration and the Department of Justice have held BP to the highest level of accountability that the law allows, including for their lies to Congress. Now it is up to Congress to enact laws that raise both the safety standards for offshore drilling and the liability cap for companies that still spill.''

HEADLINE: The Problem of 'Mutual Trust'

BYLINE: By YAN XUETONG

 BODY:
Beijing
WITH the end of America's presidential campaign and the close this week of China's 18th Communist Party Congress, leaders of these two countries now have to look ahead and consider how to handle their relations for the next four years.
President Obama, in selecting Thailand, Myanmar and Cambodia for his first trip abroad after re-election, is indicating his persistence in pivoting America's focus to East Asia, a strategy that implies a new round of competition between China and the United States. The stability of China-U.S. relations will be determined by how capable the leaders of both countries are at developing tangible means of cooperation -- rather than continuing their counterproductive talk about ''mutual trust.'' 
When President Hu Jintao met with President Obama in Los Cabos, Mexico, earlier this year, he spoke of the need for mutual trust to achieve long-term cooperation. Mr. Obama had struck the same note as a candidate in 2008 when he said, ''America and China have developed a mature, wide-ranging relationship over the past 30-plus years. Yet we still have to do serious work if we are to create the level of mutual trust necessary for long-term cooperation in a rapidly changing region.''
But mutual trust is not the answer. Perhaps the best that fierce competitors like China and America should strive for is cooperation on shared interests and an open dialogue on conflicting interests.
It is not even clear what mutual trust between nations means. There are countless examples throughout history of cooperation between major powers that lacked any of this so-called mutual trust. In fact, the lack of trust has been the norm in successful international relationships.
China and the United States have not had much trust since Communists came to power in 1949. Yet relations were just fine during 1972-1989 and through the first few years of the 21st century. China and the United States developed a working relationship in 1970 even though Mao Zedong and Richard Nixon did not trust each other. Presidents Jiang Zemin and George W. Bush developed cooperation on a counterterrorism campaign a few months after the military collision between Chinese and American air forces over the South China Sea in April 2001.
Perhaps the American-British partnership comes closest to one with trust at the core. But almost all of America's other alliances, or any country's alliances for that matter, are based on shared interests.
The U.S. relationship with Saudi Arabia is a prime example. The former advocates democracy and the latter practices absolute monarchy. Even the U.S.-France bond revealed its weakness when Paris took the lead in condemning the U.S.-led war in Iraq. Would you say that America and France trust each other? They don't, but that does not matter.
Chinese and American officials looked for a term for this unstable type of relationship in the mid-1990s. They eventually agreed on the phrase ''neither-friend-nor-enemy'' (fei di fei you ), which has become widely accepted by experts in both countries. During President Bill Clinton's visit to China in 1998, the two governments even defined their relations as a ''strategic partnership.'' During Mr. Obama's visit to China in 2009, both sides claimed that their bilateral relations reached the climax of China-U.S. history.
None of those nice definitions improved mutual trust between these two countries.
Nevertheless, the fear of nuclear war made China and the United States very cautious about conflicts that could escalate into military clashes. As long as both sides are conscious of the danger of military conflict, they will keep their competition peaceful.
The current disputes between China and Japan over the Diaoyu Islands are a case in point. Because there is no mutual trust, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta felt it necessary to visit Beijing and meet with his Chinese counterpart, Liang Guanglie, to ensure that the People's Liberation Army would not turn to a military solution as long as the United States took no side in the disputes.
In recent years, the Chinese and U.S. navies have also cooperated off the coast of Somalia to address the global threat of piracy. Collaboration on humanitarian assistance operations, search and rescue missions, and other nontraditional forms of security cooperation can help build military-to-military relationships at some levels. This type of cooperation can come before trust and will help to prevent conflicts resulting from miscommunication.
The U.S.-China relationship may be best viewed as one between two business partners. That is what we are, after all: two huge nations with interlocking economies. The Chinese like to say that, ''Money matters should be accounted for even among brothers'' (qin xiongdi ming suanzhang ). In other words, business comes before family.
Policy makers in Beijing and Washington should keep in mind that mutual trust is a result rather than a premise of long-term cooperation. Instead of ''mutual trust,'' Beijing and Washington should drop the wishful thinking and spend more effort on building a realistic relationship based on their interests.

HEADLINE: Shares Fall a 3rd Day on Weak Forecasts

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Stock indexes declining for a third consecutive day on Thursday after retailers in the United States issued weak forecasts for earnings and more people filed claims for unemployment benefits.
Wal-Mart Stores, Ross Stores and Limited Brands, the owner of Victoria's Secret, all fell after issuing forecasts that disappointed financial analysts. Wal-Mart dropped $2.59, or 3.6 percent, to $68.72.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 12,542.38, down 28.57 points. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 2.16 points to 1,353.33, and the Nasdaq composite index finished 9.87 points lower at 2,836.94. 
Stocks have fallen steadily since voters returned President Obama and a divided Congress to power. The Dow has lost 5 percent since Election Day, Nov. 6.
Investors are worried that government leaders may not reach a deal before tax increases and government spending cuts take effect on Jan. 1. The impact would total more than $600 billion for 2013 and could send the country back into recession.
E. William Stone, chief investment strategist at the PNC Asset Management Group in Philadelphia, said the bargaining in Washington was likely to drag on until next year, weighing on stocks. ''It's hard to see the market getting a whole ton of traction until that gets settled,'' he said.
President Obama will meet with Congressional leaders on Friday to talk about the budget, but he appeared to suggest on Wednesday that he would insist on an increase in tax rates for the wealthy.
T. Dale, a portfolio manager at Security Ballew Wealth Management in Jackson, Miss., said stocks were more likely to fall than to rise, partly because of the budget impasse and slowing global economic growth.
Hurricane Sandy drove the number of people seeking unemployment benefits up to 439,000 last week, the Labor Department reported. Applications for benefits rose 78,000, with a large number of them filed in storm-damaged states.
The European Union's statistics agency confirmed that the euro zone, the group of 17 countries that use the euro currency, was in recession. The economy in the region shrank 0.1 percent in the third quarter from the previous three-month period.
Among the retailers disappointing Wall Street with lower earnings forecasts was Ross Stores, whose stores include Ross Dress for Less. Its shares fell 69 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $54.44. Limited Brands dropped $1.10, or 2.4 percent, to $45.50.
Interest rates were steady. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 2/32, to 100 9/32, and the yield was unchanged at 1.59 percent.
Among stocks making big moves, NetApp, a data storage business, jumped $3.08, or 11.4 percent, to $30.20 after the company reported higher earnings than analysts had expected.
Viacom, the owner of Nickelodeon, MTV and the Paramount movie and television studio, rose $1.24, or 2.6 percent, to $49.23. The media conglomerate did better than investors had expected because of lower costs and higher fees from cable and satellite companies for carrying its cable networks.
PetSmart, a specialty pet retailer, rose $2.63, or 4.1 percent, to $67.48 after raising its full-year outlook.
Target rose $1.06, or 1.7 percent, to $62.44 after reporting that its profit increased more than analysts had forecast. The company also issued a strong outlook heading into the holiday season.
Dollar Tree, a discount retailer that sells items for $1 or less, gained $1.94, or 5.1 percent, to $39.70 after the company said its net income rose 49 percent in the third quarter.
Apple's market value fell below $500 billion for the first time since May, as its shares dropped $11.26, or 2.1 percent, to $525.62. The company's market value rose as high as $658 billion on Sept. 19, according to FactSet, a research firm.

HEADLINE: Elections, Still Not Over in Arizona, a Hot Topic

BYLINE: By FERNANDA SANTOS

 BODY:
PARADISE VALLEY, Ariz. -- The question of tipping the political scales in Arizona, like anyplace, is ''purely mathematical,'' Bruce Merrill said. More people voting for the other side matters only if enough of them vote to overcome the power of a loyal base of voters.
Dr. Merrill, a senior research fellow at the Morrison Institute for Public Policy at Arizona State University, has made a successful living dissecting and analyzing voting patterns and trends in the state and beyond. Along the way, he has helped more than 100 candidates, almost all of them Republican, use numbers to tailor their messages and assess the viability of their campaigns. He is used to addressing large forums; last month, he spoke before the Arizona Medical Association. On Tuesday, he opened the doors to his home here, a spectacular 14,000-square-foot house on the edge of a golf course, to talk to about 60 people about the Nov. 6 elections. 
The audience members listened attentively, as they do whenever they attend one of the salons that Thomas Houlon has organized here for 29 years, on subjects as varied as food, architecture, legal issues, quantum physics, medicine and the Chinese economy. Patty Barnes, a New Yorker whom he married four weeks after they met 21 years ago, helps select the topics -- sometimes culled from the books she voraciously reads, on paper and in a black Kindle she seems to carry wherever she goes, and largely inspired by personal interests and obsessions, like the intersection of the arts and neuroscience.
The group is open to members only, a collection of (mostly) well-off intellectuals and intellectually curious people of various political persuasions. Its name is Spirit of the Senses; Mr. Houlon created it as a student at Arizona State University in 1983, when he promoted the first salons as part of class work in a major he designed: intuition and creativity.
''We tried to create intellectual parties where there was meaningful dialogue,'' said Mr. Houlon, 61.
''And we created a community out of it,'' added Ms. Barnes, also 61.
Before Dr. Merrill got started on Tuesday, audience members were reminded to switch off their cellphones.
''I felt, if Romney lost the election, it was because of his selection of Paul Ryan,'' Dr. Merrill said, adding that this was not because Mr. Ryan ''was anything like Sarah Palin,'' the former governor of Alaska who was Senator John McCain's running mate in the 2008 election.
Mr. Ryan ''is a brilliant young man,'' Dr. Merrill said, but he ''moved Romney so hard to the right it was hard for him to move back to the middle.''
He also had some things to say about the still-unresolved state races in Arizona, its record number of provisional ballots, the misinformation about the date of the election in Spanish-language materials and how it all smelled of voter suppression.
As he spoke, Lorita Winfield, a registered Republican from a family of Italian immigrants who said she voted for President Obama because of Mr. Romney's stance on immigration, took notes -- ''O,'' as in Obama, ''ran a brilliant tactical campaign.''
A cellphone rang. A man searched reproachfully for the culprit, a woman who coyly slipped her hand inside her bag and mouthed an apology for the disruption.
Membership in Spirit of the Senses is cultivated the old-fashioned way: through word of mouth. The salons happen at people's homes, which are often an attraction in themselves. Paradise Valley, after all, is a fairly fancy corner of the country.
Dr. Merrill and his wife, Janis, have been members since 2006, though he has been a presenter for much longer. This year, his salon was supposed to be a discussion about the meaning of the election results, and it was, though not for local races. That is because, by Thursday, there were still 163,482 votes to be counted in the state before Friday's deadline.
Provisional ballots, which make up the bulk of the uncounted votes, were cast by people who showed up at the polls only to find that their names were not on voter rolls, or who said they never got the ballots they had signed up to receive at home, or who had received absentee ballots but decided to vote at the polling place after all.
Syd Golston, a self-described ''left-wing Democrat,'' education administrator and Spirit of the Senses member since May 2011, said that at the polling place where she worked, Saguaro High School in Scottsdale, more than 200 of the roughly 900 people who voted used provisional ballots.
''A lot of them were minorities,'' Ms. Golston said.
Earlier, Dr. Merrill had noted, ''I would not be surprised if provisionals would come slightly more from people of low economic status.''
''Slightly?'' Ms. Winfield, an amateur historian who joined the group in 2006, asked gently.
Someone wondered if the uncounted votes could change the outcome of the Senate race, in which Representative Jeff Flake, a Republican, was ahead of his Democratic opponent, Richard H. Carmona, by 81,553 votes on Thursday afternoon, according to the tally posted by the Arizona secretary of state, Ken Bennett.
The question, Dr. Merrill said, is whether Latino voters turned out in high enough numbers to tip the scales, which he found to be unlikely -- this time, at least.
The lesson behind the record number of provisional ballots cast this year and the delay in tallying all of the votes, he said, ''is that we have to figure out a better way to run elections.''

HEADLINE: History Lessons: American Values and the G.O.P.

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''The Party of Work'' (column, Nov. 9):
I disagree with David Brooks's highly mythologized view of American history. True, some American colonies were founded by Protestant dissidents. Many others, including New York, New Hampshire, Virginia and the Carolinas, were not.
There is no evidence that they believed in ''liberty, individualism, equal opportunity, populism and laissez-faire.'' They founded theocratic, intolerant and hierarchical societies. They held to strict Calvinism, perhaps the least Christian version of Christianity in its inherent lack of lovingkindness. They were not children of the Enlightenment, as were our founding fathers 150 years later. 
Thank goodness America was not established on the principles of these ''Puritan dissidents'' but on the liberal principles of our founders.
At the formation of our country the most widely read and influential pamphlets were those of Thomas Paine, and to learn the principles on which our nation was founded, one should read him rather than William Bradford.
STEPHEN E. SILVER Santa Fe, N.M., Nov. 11, 2012
To the Editor:
David Brooks gets it exactly right when he explains why Republican economic values are out of sync with the rising majority of Americans who resoundingly re-elected President Obama. That winning coalition of Americans believes that government can help lift them up.
Mr. Brooks urges Republican leaders to research the everyday problems that Americans face in trying to succeed. What Mr. Brooks doesn't say is that this is precisely the work that President Obama and Democrats have been doing.
Mr. Brooks envisions a new Republican ''party of work,'' striking a new way forward, letting ''Democrats be the party of security, defending the 20th-century welfare state.'' I'd say 21st-century thinking and policy making won this election for Democrats.
The ''party of work'' has already been launched. Welcome aboard, Republicans!
LINDA M. OWEN Bainbridge Island, Wash., Nov. 9, 2012
To the Editor:
David Brooks asks, ''What exactly happens to the ambitious kid in Akron at each stage of his life in this new economy?'' I wonder, just who is this hypothetical kid he refers to? Is this the child of the factory owner or of the single mother making minimum wage? Is this kid living in the comfortable suburbs or in the inner city? There are disparities in education, housing, health care and future opportunities that depend on the answer.
Mr. Brooks's question reflects the nostalgia he and the Republican Party still have for the ''American creed'' that equates hard work with success. I am particularly offended by his remark ''Let Democrats be the party of security, defending the 20th-century welfare state.''
It is this very rhetoric of divisiveness in the guise of helping people ''transform their lives'' that has been rejected by the American people, who understand that government does have a responsibility to that kid in Akron if he or she was not lucky enough to be born into wealth.
I suspect that Republicans, shellshocked after President Obama's victory, are licking their wounds. But unless the rhetoric changes, and the hearts and minds of the Republican Party understand the composition of the United States, they will be licking their wounds for a long time to come.

To the Editor:
David Brooks perpetuates the myth that America's Protestant founders distrusted government, that Ronald Reagan and Representative Paul D. Ryan are the heirs of Samuel Adams and Benjamin Franklin. This is a distortion of our revolutionary legacy.
By their words and deeds, the leaders of the colonial and Revolutionary period embraced the idea that liberty depended on collective acts of self-governance. From the framing on shipboard of the Mayflower Compact, to the series of Boston town meetings that culminated in the destruction of British tea in Boston Harbor, to the drafting and signing of the Declaration of Independence, America's earliest leaders demanded the right to play a part in public affairs.
The founders believed not in freedom from government, but in the freedom and responsibility to participate in government.

HEADLINE: The Halt and the Lame

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: We're the least worst! 

 BODY:
Ryan Avent reminds us just how poor economic performance has been since the crisis, all across the advanced world: 
As John Quiggin has been emphasizing, this across-the-board poor performance puts the lie to claims that it's all because of that scary Obama person; in fact, the US has done better than the rest, although still quite badly -- this is indeed a race between the halt and the lame. (You want to be careful about the Japan comparison, by the way: given Japan's special demography, with the working-age population actually shrinking at a fairly rapid pace, it's not really doing any worse than the euro area and in fact is arguably doing better).
What accounts for the differences? The most obvious culprit is austerity, which has been much more marked in Europe and the UK than in the US. Here's the IMF's estimate of the cyclically-adjusted primary balance -- what the budget balance excluding interest payments would be if the economy were operating at full employment. Europe and the UK have fully reversed any stimulus introduced during the crisis; America has not:
You can always try to argue that this has nothing to do with the results we see. But since textbook macroeconomics says that contractionary fiscal policy is contractionary; since those of us who went with the theory rather than the confidence fairy said it would be contractionary; and sure enough, the areas pursuing austerity have done badly; the case for a connection is pretty strong.
And this means that much of the advanced world blithely repeated the mistakes of the 1930s.

HEADLINE: The Selective Memory of the Fed's Stress Tests

BYLINE: PETER EAVIS


HIGHLIGHT: The Federal Reserve has to conduct annual stress tests of the banking system, but there's a dire possibility that it doesn't seem to want to contemplate: the sort of economic turbulence that affected the United States in the 1970s and 1980s. 

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve seems to be hoping that an ugly chapter in America's economic history won't repeat itself. 
As part of the regulatory overhaul that took place after the financial crisis, the Fed now has to conduct annual stress tests of the banking system. In these tests, the central bank tries to assess whether the banks have the financial strength to get through some pretty dire conditions. On Thursday, the Fed outlined those circumstances, giving theoretical forecasts for things like economic growth, bond yields and house prices. 
But there's a certain type of dire possibility that the Fed doesn't seem to want to contemplate: the sort of economic turbulence that affected the United States in the 1970s and 1980s. Back then, inflation would get out of control and the Fed would have slam on the economic brakes by hoisting key interest rates. An economic slowdown would ensue.
In its latest stress test documents, the Fed supplies a baseline case, an adverse situation and a severely adverse one. In the latter two, the Fed does envision a lot of nasty things. In the severe one, for instance, it assumes the unemployment rate exceeding 12 percent in early 2014.
But what the Fed doesn't consider is the country's cost of borrowing rising to the peaks seen during the 1970s and 1980s. 
In the severe case, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note is at 1.2 percent during the theoretical slump. In the merely adverse case, the Fed assumes it goes as high as 4 percent during a putative recession that goes from the end of 2012 to the beginning of 2014. The 10-year Treasury yield exceeded 10 percent for sizable part of the 1980s.
Granted, high Treasury yields may be introduced in some form. The Fed said Thursday that in the next couple of weeks it will provide a "market shock" scenario, to be applied only by large banks with Wall Street operations. This will factor in "a broad increase in U.S.Treasury yields."
It's highly unlikely that runaway inflation will return any time soon, forcing interest rates back to 1980s levels. And if we start to move into an economy with higher inflation, the Fed can always adjust its stress tests to reflect that reality.
Still, stress tests are meant to capture the unexpected. Remember that housing crash hardly anyone foresaw? Perhaps there needs to be a fourth stress test possibility: the super severe retro recession.

HEADLINE: Mourning Twinkies on Twitter

BYLINE: DEALBOOK


HIGHLIGHT: The bankruptcy announcement by Hostess Brands has overwhelmed a group of people mourning the potential loss of a nostalgic childhood treat that they haven't eaten in decades. 

 BODY:
 6:03 p.m. | Updated 
The public's reaction following the bankruptcy announcement by Hostess Brands has been overwhelming. On one side are politically minded readers discussing the merits of unions and private equity firms. On the other side, a group of people who have become inexplicably overwhelmed by the potential loss of a nostalgic childhood treat that they haven't eaten in decades. 
Twinkies and Ding Dongs are likely to find new owners if the company trademarks are put up for auction. But that hasn't stopped people from a public display of affection that is usually reserved for long-lost relatives or NFL playoff games. 
 Even Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, whose girth has been a subject of much debate, was dragged into the discussion. 
"It's bad that I even said the word 'Twinkies' from behind this microphone," Mr. Christie said in response to a reporter's question during an speech on Friday in Newark.

HEADLINE: America's Mid-20th-Century Infrastructure

BYLINE: UWE E. REINHARDT


HIGHLIGHT: Americans are curiously willing to tolerate shoddy infrastructure rather than supporting spending to repair and improve it, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Uwe E. Reinhardt is an economics professor at Princeton. 
Europeans visiting the Northeastern United States - and many parts of the East Coast -- can show their children what Europe's infrastructure looked like during the 1960s.
In New York, they can take taxis bumping over streets marked by potholes. European children might find it funny. They can descend into a dingy and grimy underground world to ride New York City's quaint and screeching subway system, if they can figure out where trains go. 
They can take the children for a ride with Amtrak from New York to the nation's capital, giggling as the train slowly heaves and rolls, often in fits and starts, along the rickety tracks. Passengers can be heard joking that the Navy trains its sailors on this railway system, because anyone who can make it through two or three cars without bumping into seated passengers or spilling food on them is fit to go to sea.
If they departed from Pennsylvania Station in New York, they would not have known until 5 to 10 minutes before departure from which track the train would leave. And it might not leave on time. In their home country, the children would have learned that the track from which a train departs is printed in the train schedule. It is the same every day.
At Pennsylvania Station, hundreds of passengers wait in suspense for the announcement of the track and dash to it in a mad rush, running along the train in a frantic search for a seat. In Europe, one would have booked a seat in a rail car that stops at a spot shown on a poster on the track.

Unlike Europe or Asia, where trains typically adhere to the minute to scheduled times, the departure times in Amtrak's schedules merely represent a promise that the train will not leave before then. The actual getaway might be many minutes or even more than an hour after the scheduled departure time, with any of dozens of different excuses offered. Brakes on the train stuck. Signal switches malfunctioned. Electricity was not available to the train for some reason. A train ahead, on the same track, broke down. And so on.
Arriving at a destination on time, something Europeans take largely for granted, is relatively rare on Amtrak. Furthermore, the train in Europe or Asia is likely to have traveled at much higher speed. The tracks there are so smooth that one could easily carry an open cup of coffee along several cars or work on the computer.
Why and how Americans, who pride themselves on being fussy consumers, have put up with this mid-20th-century rail system is a mystery.
Even more wondrous than the archaic subway and rail system and the potholes in the streets is the system of distributing electric power to households and factories in large parts of the Northeastern United States. Power is often still carried on lines that hang in graceful catenaries of various depths from poles that lean left or right randomly but rarely stand straight. And which are vulnerable to powerful storms, like Hurricane Sandy.
When a German high-school classmate visited me, we came upon the intersection below, less than a mile from the center of Princeton, N.J. My friend burst out laughing at the abundance of wires in every direction, something he had seen only on his travels to the developing world.
In my youth, electric power in Germany's countryside, where I grew up, was carried on power lines strung from very tall and straight poles. But for decades now, power lines have been buried underground in Germany and most of the rest of Europe.
Malte Lehming, opinion-page editor of the Berlin newspaper Tagesspiegel, noted in his essay "Welcome to America. Take a Number" in The New York Times:
I spent half a day hunting for a store with flashlights in stock, because a storm had knocked out our power. In five decades in Germany I have never experienced a single power failure, because the power lines are usually underground and well maintained.
Imagine that - life without power failures! In much of the Northeastern United States - and perhaps in many other parts of the country as well - lengthy power disruptions are part of the American way of life. In Princeton, they occur somewhere in the township after almost every thunderstorm or snowstorm, as branches snap from trees and take down vulnerable power lines.
Last fall, for example, after a brief storm dumped wet snow on trees, many parts of New Jersey, Princeton included, were without power for about a week. Parts of Connecticut were without power for more than two weeks.
In 1958, the economist John Kenneth Galbraith drew attention to America's neglect of its infrastructure in his famous book, "The Affluent Society." Alas, his call for a better balance between private and public infrastructure has gone largely unheeded in this country in the ensuing half-century.
Our country reminds me of the old tale of a frog that allowed itself to be cooked to death after it was put in a pan of cold water that was very gradually heated to the boiling point. Although apparently there is no scientific basis for that tale -- biologists say the frog would jump out -- we do seem to act like that frog, as our infrastructure ever-so-gradually steadily decays around us.
Instead of setting about to bring our infrastructure up to 21st-century standards - which might, alas, involve more of the much detested public-sector investment -- we angrily and yet meekly suffer for days or weeks without light, heat and transportation, verbally shaking our fists at the power companies but leaving it at that.
We are, at most, prepared to stock our households with flashlights and candles and, if we have the money, buy portable generators that can produce a modest amount of electricity, albeit at great expense. How can this be an efficient way of bringing electric power to households?
In so many ways the United States is a great country. The American people are innovative and hard-working, more so than most Europeans. It amazes me that they put up so fatalistically with this old-fashioned and decaying infrastructure.

HEADLINE: Oh Kolkata! My Second Goodbye to Home

BYLINE: SAMBUDDHA MITRA MUSTAFI


HIGHLIGHT: With so much changing in the rest of India, Kolkata's constancy feels like a regression. 

 BODY:
Late in June, I moved back to my hometown, Kolkata, after eight years in Delhi and one in New York. As I looked to kick off my freelance career, Kolkata was the obvious choice for a base - there, I did not have to pay for rent or food (thanks, mom) and I thought I would rediscover the city that knew all my firsts.
But last month, I moved to Mumbai. My stay in Kolkata had lasted merely three months. 
Within days of my arrival in Kolkata, I realized that there was very little to rediscover in the city. The barber I went to since I was six still has his same little salon, and still walks home at the same time every day for his afternoon siesta; the tailor down the road has not expanded his operations by an inch; our favorite cheap bar from the student years is still as decrepit, cheap and atmospheric.
I began to fear that if I stayed in the city I would meet the same fate - I would get stuck as what I am, forever.
"The best thing about Kolkata is that it never changes," a friend tried to reassure me. But with so much changing in the rest of India, Kolkata's constancy actually feels like a regression.
A lot has been written about the current West Bengal government's muddled policies, but Kolkata's decay started much earlier under the Communists. In a state where 68 percent of the population lives in rural areas but where agriculture makes up just 20 percent of G.D.P., exploiting the urban-rural divide is a potent, self-serving political strategy. Bengal's Communists mastered this cynical art, and it kept them in power for 34 years.
The poor rural farmers voted for them, and the Communists kept the voters poor and rural by giving them small farmlands and subsidies but warding off investment, denying them productive technology and economic mobility, thereby neutering citizens' aspirations of a better life or government.
Kolkata voted for the opposition, so the Communists let it rot, blaming its plight on outsiders - the federal government, corporations and the foreign hand. Rapid urbanization is the hallmark of an emerging economy like India's, but that was inimical to the Bengal Communist strategy.
Today, Kolkata is not among the top 30 fastest-growing cities in India. Out of India's 53 cities with a million-plus population, only two are from West Bengal. Kerala has less than 40 percent of West Bengal's population, but it has six cities with a million people or more; Gujarat, with two-thirds of Bengal's population, has four on the list.
Mamata Banerjee's government in West Bengal has adopted the same opportunistic strategy of the rival Communists - a mix of antigrowth economics and populist rhetoric - that had turned the state into an economic swamp. Bengal has now replaced neighboring Bihar as India's cautionary tale, rife with laughable administrative stunts, middle-class despair and Pinocchio politicians.
My favorite quiz master is now a member of Parliament for the state's ruling party, Trinamool Congress - ironic because his boss hates intelligent questions. The state's finance minister once headed India's apex chamber of commerce - he now opposes foreign investment in job-creating sectors like retail.
What India does today, Bengal thinks about doing it the day after tomorrow - airports, roads, flyovers, subway stations, special economic zones, Tata Nanos, et al. In the land that has produced some outstanding thought leaders, I felt a disheartening crisis of original thought and leaders.
Fed up with my constant complaints, my mother finally diagnosed the ailment: "One year in America has driven you mad," she said.
My tipping point came after a visit from a close high school friend, now a banker in Dubai. For one week we hung out at all our favorite spots - the lanes, food shacks, nightclubs and restaurants that we used to frequent when Kolkata and Park Street were the entire width of our world. One night as we headed back home at 11:30 p.m., the new alcohol curfew, something struck us almost simultaneously.
We were misfits in our own city - two single guys in their early 30s. We were part of Kolkata's missing generation - most of the city's people between 25 and 45, the ones who drive the economy through their production and consumption, had left for places where they can produce and consume a lot more. Most people we saw on our evenings out were either students or older folks who returned after making their fortunes elsewhere.
Of our 120 high school classmates on Facebook, nearly two-thirds do not live in Kolkata. Of those who stayed home, many did so to run family businesses.
The classmates who left Kolkata are scattered all over the world. The private equity manager in Chicago wants to relocate to India, but in Mumbai or Delhi; the fashion photographer in Mumbai thinks Kolkata gets boring after a week; the Hare Krishna preacher in New Zealand will perhaps go where the Lord takes him, but I doubt it will be Kolkata.
The day my banker friend left for Dubai, I started applying for jobs outside Kolkata. I now work in a Mumbai think tank. A fortnight before I left Kolkata, my sister and eight of her classmates, all recent economics graduates from Kolkata University, boarded a train for Bangalore in search of jobs.
In good Bengali tradition, now I think for a living too. Sadly though, I had to think outside Kolkata.

HEADLINE: Obama on Climate Policy: Not Just Now, Thanks

BYLINE: JOHN M. BRODER


HIGHLIGHT: Rather than propose a way to bridge the political divide on the issue, the president said he would be listening to experts and then conducting an "education process" about long-term steps to address a warming planet. 

 BODY:
Environmental advocates have expressed frustration with the lack of discussion of climate change in the presidential race this year, a reticence that persisted even after the devastation of Hurricane Sandy. On Wednesday, in his first post-election news conference, President Obama offered his most extensive remarks on climate change in months. They did not particularly thrill environmentalists.
The president said that it was impossible to attribute a specific weather event to global warming, but noted there have been an extraordinary number of severe weather events in North America and around the globe. 
"And I am a firm believer that climate change is real, that it is impacted by human behavior and carbon emissions," he said. "And as a consequence, I think we've got an obligation to future generations to do something about it."
He said that in his first term he had ratcheted up fuel economy standards for vehicles and doubled the production of renewable energy. "But we haven't done as much as we need to," he said.
Mr. Obama then said that the issue sharply divides Democrats and Republicans, and also different regions of the country, depending on their production and consumption of energy.
But rather than propose a way to bridge those divides, the president seemed to punt. He said he would be listening to experts over the next several months and then conducting an "education process" about long-term steps to address the warming planet.

"There's no doubt that for us to take on climate change in a serious way would involve making some tough political choices," the president said. "And understandably, I think the American people right now have been so focused, and will continue to be focused on our economy and jobs and growth, that if the message is somehow we're going to ignore jobs and growth simply to address climate change, I don't think anybody is going to go for that. I won't go for that."
This assertion - that the nation cannot address its climate and environmental challenges while also dealing with jobs and the economy - is at odds with the approach that Mr. Obama has taken since early in his presidency. He often touted the benefits of "green jobs" as an antidote to a stalled economy, and devoted some $90 billion of his 2009 stimulus package to a variety of measures that he said would save energy, clean up the atmosphere and create jobs.
Earlier this year, Mr. Obama accused Republican critics of wrongly pitting the economy and the environment against each other.
"There will always be people in this country who say that we've got to choose between clean air, clean water and growing the economy, between doing right by the environment and putting people back to work," Mr. Obama declared in March at a conference that included environmentalists, outdoorsmen and small business owners.
"I'm here to tell you this is a false choice," he said.
In his press conference this week, Mr,. Obama also said he would not pursue a tax on carbon dioxide emissions as part of a deal to address the so-called fiscal cliff of impending tax increases and budget cuts, saying there was no political consensus for imposing such an energy tax.
"That I'm pretty certain of," the president said. "And, look, we're still trying to debate whether we can just make sure that middle-class families don't get a tax hike. Let's see if we can resolve that. That should be easy. This one is hard."
He added nonetheless that it was important to address climate-altering emissions because it would have an impact and a cost "down the road."
Joseph Romm, a former Energy Department official who runs the influential Climate Progress blog at the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning research and advocacy group with close White House ties, pronounced the president's climate comments "lame."
"I think it's hard to know what's going on inside his head, because he certainly understands the issue," Mr. Romm said in a telephone interview. "I think he thinks a tax deal is going to be very hard and he doesn't want to make it harder by injecting a carbon tax into the mix."
"It was a very wishy-washy statement," he added. "I just think his advisers are telling him to deflect the issue entirely."

 Hostess Brands Moves to Wind Down Operations | "Friday's move could spell the end of Hostess, a company that has endured wars, countless diet fads and even an earlier Chapter 11 filing," Michael J. de la Merced reported. DealBook 
Mergers & Acquisitions 
 Qatar Wealth Fund Backs Glencore's Bid for Xstrata | "Analysts said the backing of Qatar Holding, Xstrata's second-largest shareholder after Glencore, probably would lead to overall shareholder approval next week," Mark Scott reported. DealBook 
 DealBook Column: A Dose of Realism for the Chief of J.C. Penney | Andrew Ross Sorkin says that Ronald B. Johnson appears to be trying to create what Steve Jobs's biographer called a "reality distortion field." DealBook 
"Ron Johnson's remake of JCP has assumed the consumer - the only one who matters - is the one who shops at Target or Macy's or Nordstrom's. Instead of pivoting on and strengthening the historic JCP brand, Johnson's decided to recreate the Target and Apple wheel, a move akin to Toyota suddenly deciding it's Porsche. In short, a ridiculous and condescending move," Margaret Bogenrief, a partner at ACM Partners, a boutique crisis management and distressed investing firm, recently wrote.
 With Jefferies Deal, 'Baby Berkshire' Deviates From Buffett | The Leucadia National Corporation deviated from Warren E. Buffett's playbook by buying an entire investment bank, Mr. de la Merced reported. DealBook

Legal/Regulatory 
 Report Faults MF Global Regulators | "When MF Global was on the brink of collapse, chaos and confusion spread not only among the firm's executives in New York but also among its regulators in Washington," Ben Protess and Mr. de la Merced reported. DealBook 

        
 House Report Says Corzine's Risky Bets Aided MF Global's Fall | Even as the findings made a case for civil and regulatory action, the report hardly chipped away at Jon S. Corzine's legal defense. DealBook 
 The Trade: For Obama, No Easy Fix for Convoluted Regulatory System | Jesse Eisinger of ProPublica says the core problems with the financial system and its regulators are "impervious to which party occupies the White House. They are bipartisan and structural." DealBook 
The structural issues go deeper. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission still exist as two separate agencies, a huge missed opportunity for Dodd-Frank and one borne of politics. The C.F.T.C. is protected (and bashed) by the Senate Agriculture Committee, the S.E.C. by the Senate Banking Committee. Merging the agencies would mean that one of those committees would lose power, so forget about that. Gary Gensler, the head of the commodities commission, has been tough, but has been limited by his agency's paltry resources. And, anyway, these agencies are still run by commissions, not single heads, and they rely on Congress for their financing. It's little surprise that such a structure creates plodding impotence.
 Defense Opens Insider Trade Case With Attack on Witnesses | "Jurors were presented with a stark choice," Peter Lattman reported. "The defendants were either the senior links in a "corrupt chain" of Wall Street traders, or scapegoats for the criminal conduct of their subordinates." DealBook 

        
 Trial to Open in $68 Million Insider Trading Case | Federal prosecutors say Anthony Chiasson, a founder of the Level Global Investors hedge fund, and Todd Newman, a former portfolio manager, were part of a conspiracy that illegally traded technology stocks. DealBook

HEADLINE: Democrats Unlikely to Regain House in 2014

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: Although 17 seats is not an extraordinary number, both historical precedent in midterm election years and a deeper examination of this year's results would argue strongly against Democrats being able to gain that many seats. 

 BODY:
Democrats did not have as strong a performance in races for the United States House of Representatives last week as they did in the contests for the Senate and the presidency. Instead, Republicans retained control of the chamber.
But Democrats did regain some ground in the House. Although several races remain uncalled, Democrats would wind up with 201 seats in the House if all races are assigned to the current leader in the vote count - an improvement from the 193 seats Democrats held after the 2010 midterm elections. That would leave Democrats needing to pick up 17 seats to win control of the chamber in 2014.
Although 17 seats is not an extraordinary number, both historical precedent in midterm election years and a deeper examination of this year's results would argue strongly against Democrats being able to gain that many seats. 
There is also reason to suspect that Democrats are unlikely to sustain the sort of losses in the House that they did in 2010. But odds are that the electoral climate in 2014 will be somewhere between neutral and Republican-leaning, rather than favoring Democrats.
In midterm election years since World War II, the president's party has lost an average of 26 seats in the House, as shown in the chart below. The president's party gained seats only twice, in 1998 and 2002.
The chart details a few other pieces of information that seem to have some influence on the magnitude of gains or losses for the president's party.
First, there is some reversion to the mean: a party tends to lose more seats in the House when it has more of them to lose.
There is also another type of reversion to the mean that is often overlooked: the president's party tends to lose more seats in the midterms following years when it performed very strongly in the presidential race. For example, the large margins of victory achieved by Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1956 and Lyndon Johnson in 1964 were followed by large losses in the House two years later. 
This may seem counterintuitive: doesn't a party that wins the presidency by a wider margin have more of a mandate and get more slack from voters? 
But what we observe in the data, instead, is a "reverse coattails" effect. When a party wins the presidency by a large margin, it usually benefits from voters who are mainly interested in the presidential election itself, and then vote for the same party in races down the ballot. These types of voters may not show up to vote in midterm years. Thus, the more a party benefits from presidential coattails in the presidential election year, the more it stands to lose two years later.
The chart also lists an economic variable: the growth in nonfarm payroll jobs over the first two years of a president's term, as measured from the January in which the new president is inaugurated through October of the midterm election year.
The relationship between economic performance and a party's performance in the midterm elections is somewhat more tenuous than it is in presidential election years. 
In 2002, there was a decline in jobs early in George W. Bush's term. However, Republicans actually gained seats in the House that year. In 1994, by contrast, job growth was robust, but Bill Clinton's Democrats lost 54 seats.
The economic relationship registers as being more meaningful if one controls for other factors, like the party's margin in the presidential race and the number of seats it controlled before the midterms - or if one excludes years, like 1974 and 2002, that may have been affected by one-off contingencies (Watergate and the Sept. 11 attacks, respectively). 
One should be careful about reading too much into this, however, because of the potential for overfitting the statistical model. (That is, including too many independent variables given a relatively small sample size, potentially picking up on spurious relationships.) 
In addition, there may be relationships between which party controls the House and how the economy affects the midterms. If one party controls both the presidency and Congress, it may receive more credit or blame for the economy than when control is divided, as it is now.
Midterm losses for the president's party have been somewhat more modest in recent years than during the middle part of the 20th century. This potentially reflects the fact that more Congressional districts have strongly partisan makeups now, leaving fewer seats in play. 
As 2010 demonstrated, however, no firewall is all that robust in the event of a wave election year.
That Mr. Obama won the presidency by a relatively narrow margin this year and that Democrats do not control the House would argue against a wave election this year. Still, the more likely situation is losses rather than gains for Democrats, based on the historical record. And a 17-seat gain would strongly defy historical precedent.
Nor did Democrats come especially close to winning the House in 2012, once one examines the results from individual races more carefully. 
This year, there were only 11 House seats that Democrats lost by five or fewer percentage points. Thus, even if they had performed five points better across the board, they would still have come up six seats short of controlling the chamber.
In other words, Democrats would have to perform quite a bit better in House races in 2014 than they did in 2012 to win control of the chamber - when usually the president's party does quite a bit worse instead. 
One should never say never when it comes to forecasting the outcome of an election two years in advance. But it might take a major scandal in the Republican party, or for Republicans to splinter into factions, for Democrats to have more than a remote chance of winning the House.
And there is one more factor working against Democrats: they have become increasingly reliant upon voters, like Hispanics and those under the age of 30, who do not turn out reliably in midterm election years. Democrats have a broader coalition than Republicans do in high-turnout environments, so perhaps this will benefit them in 2016. But these are not the voters you would want to depend upon to make gains in midterm election years, when turnout is much lower.

HEADLINE: The Early Word: Cliff

BYLINE: ASHLEY SOUTHALL


HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times, plus a look at what's happening in Washington. 

 BODY:
 In Today's Times: 

        
With Washington aflutter with talk about the "fiscal cliff," Jackie Calmes provides a primeron the issue.

        
On Capitol Hill, members of the bipartisan group of senators known as the Gang of Eight have all but given up on their efforts to reach an agreement on the fiscal impasse. Instead, Jonathan Weisman writes, they are placing their hopes on the talks that will begin today at the White House between President Obama and Congressional leaders, most importantly Speaker John A. Boehner. 
 

        
The stakes in the fiscal talks are high for public schools. Already hit hard by budget cuts, schools could see an estimated $2 billion in federal funding disappear if the White House and Congress cannot reach a deal, Motoko Rich writes.

        
President Obama got a first-hand look on Thursday at the devastation wrought by Hurricane Sandy in New York City. James Barron writes that the president pledged that the federal government would work closely with state and local officials on "a game plan for how we're going to be able to resource the rebuilding process."

        
The Central Intelligence Agency's inspector general is reviewing the conduct of David H. Petraeus to see if he used federal resources to carry out his extramarital affair, Eric Schmitt reports. Mr. Petraeus is scheduled to testify today before the House and Senate Intelligence Committees about the Sept. 11 attacks in Benghazi, Libya.

        
Republicans are urging Mitt Romney to stop talking about the election. Writing from the Republican governors' meeting in Las Vegas, Jeff Zeleny reports that the governors, some already looking ahead to 2016, believe Mr. Romney's musings are unwelcome distractions from their efforts to rebound after failing to take the White House and the Senate from Democrats.

        
Mr. Obama's three-to-one advantage over Mr. Romney among gay voters proved decisive for his re-election and troubling for Republicans. Micah Cohen explains that voters who identify as gay, lesbian or bisexual help make up a third of the electorate when combined with other Democratic-leaning demographics like African-Americans and Latinos.
 Happening in Washington: 

        
At 10:15 a.m., President Obama and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. will convene talks at the White House on how to cut the deficit. Joining them will be Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader; Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader; Mr. Boehner, the House speaker; and Representative Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader.

        
Mr. Petraeus will discuss the Sept. 11 Benghazi attack at closed-door hearings before the House Intelligence Committee at 7:30 a.m., then before the Senate Intelligence Committee at 9.

        
-Economic data expected Friday include October industrial production at 9:15 a.m., followed at 10 by October petroleum statistics.

HEADLINE: Pricing Parenthood

BYLINE: By NADIA TAHA

 BODY:
In an article in the Your Money special section we just published about bulletproofing your finances, I wrote about one big money move that would be awfully beneficial to my bottom line: not having children. For all that we know about how expensive it is to raise a child, however, we don't know exactly how much it costs.
So I decided to come up with an estimate, rough as it is, for what it would cost my spouse and me to have one child. I figure it would run close to $2 million by the time it was all over. How did I come up with that estimate? 
The United States Department of Agriculture Department publishes an annual report on what families spend on their children, so I used that as a basis for some of my calculations and then tailored them to our own finances and geography. In 2007, The Wall Street Journal tried to improve upon the government figures, but some of the expenses they included seem based on the budgets of the truly rich, like furniture from Pottery Barn and bottled water delivery.
Without excessive expenditures, surely people like us could raise a child for more than the $435,030 the government estimates but less than the $776,000, $1 million or $1.6 million guessed at on the pages of the Wall Street Journal. Right?
I had hoped so, but my estimation of what my spouse and I might spend - and, crucially, what we might lose - having a child ended up being more than those estimates.
In order to be as conservative as possible, I stuck with the Agriculture Department's figures for the cost of food, transit, clothing and miscellaneous expenses (personal care items, entertainment, reading materials) for children in a two-parent household in the urban Northeast with a combined income of over $103,350.
Those costs are higher in New York City, but our earnings are below the average for the category we fall in, and I wanted to be conservative in my calculations. But for housing, health care and child care I changed the numbers to be more specific to where we live. I used the average cost of full-time child care in New York City for the first few years, $12,750 to $16,000, according to the Administration of Child Services, and then reverted to the Agriculture Department numbers for child care and education until age 18.
My health insurance plan would charge us nearly $4,000 more each year for an additional dependent. Co-pays, prescriptions and other therapies could easily cost another $750 each year. At some point, our hypothetical child would probably have braces as we both did, which costs $4,000 out of pocket.
To estimate the cost of housing a child, I subtracted our rent from the rent we would pay to live in our neighborhood in a more suitable space -- one with higher security, a more responsive landlord, reliable heat and better stroller-accessibility. Staying in our neighborhood and continuing to rent would keep our other costs in check, especially because of the quality of the public schools here.
Just as our parents paid most of our undergraduate tuition, my husband and I would want to help our child pay for college. To pay for half of the projected tuition at an average-price four-year public university would require we save $5,328 each year from birth to age 18, according to BlackRock's college savings calculator.
And since we would probably not cut off our child financially once he or she reached the age of majority, I added the cost of the basics (housing, clothing, food, transportation and health care) between age 18 and 25. Later in life, when this young adult has children, we will still spend money by supporting our grandchildren at a rate of $8,289 every five years, the average according to a MetLife study of grandparents' relationships with their grandchildren.
Then there are the losses I would suffer as a working mother: half a year of forgone wages while on maternity leave and earning 73 percent of what men earn instead of 90 percent like nonmothers (or in my case, the equivalent fraction of my current salary) for the remainder of my career, according to a Columbia University study on the motherhood wage gap. This doesn't include reduced benefits like 401(k) contributions, but it still adds up to over $700,000. The flip side of this equation is what economists call the "fatherhood premium," which increases a man's earnings about 4 percent.
Of course these expenditures and losses are not the strict minimum required to raise a child - not by a long shot. But if we were to have a child and do what most other parents do by trying to give this new little life the very best start possible, it would probably cost us $1.8 million including everything I mentioned above.
Then there are other sacrifices to mental health and perhaps fiscal health, too, albeit in ways that are hard to predict. Some of those disadvantages seem readily apparent, like lower marital satisfaction, higher depression rates, plus that "mommy track."
So did you think about the cost, in dollars, of having a child before you decided to become a parent? Or do you find the whole idea of factoring in it at all to be odd?
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Sagging Production Is Affecting Even Germany

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
INDUSTRIAL production has been stagnating in many advanced economies around the world and is beginning to damage the German economy, which has been the strongest in the troubled euro zone. 
Figures reported this week showed that industrial production in the euro zone fell 2.5 percent in September from the previous month, the largest monthly decline since January 2009, during the worst part of the credit crisis. Production in Germany was off 2.1 percent.
Although the figures are seasonally adjusted, they can be volatile. But the longer-term trend was poor even before the September figures came in.
The accompanying charts show year-to-year changes in industrial production, using three-month moving averages to smooth out some volatility, among advanced economies as a group, in the euro zone and five major countries.
The Dutch government compiles industrial production figures from around the world. In August, the total for advanced economies was lower than it had been a year earlier, something that had not happened since 2009, although the three-month average, as shown in the chart, remained a little higher.
The September figures for some countries will not be out until the end of this month, but it seems likely they will show a drop as well.
''Germany has slowed because weak global demand, particularly for the major machinery that Germany exports, is creating lower demand for Germany's exports,'' wrote Greg Jensen of Bridgewater Associates, a hedge fund and advisory firm. He said German companies were accumulating large inventories and their profits were suffering.
There are exceptions to the world pattern. Chinese industrial production continues to rise at a rate of more than 9 percent a year. While that is down from last year, it remains good. On Friday, the Federal Reserve reported that industrial production in the United States slipped in October by 0.4 percent, the second decline in the last three months, although the Fed said it would have been close to unchanged but for the effects of Hurricane Sandy. The annual growth rate is down to less than 3 percent.
But the declines have spread to some developing countries. Brazil's production is running about 3 percent below that of a year earlier, and Indian production is basically flat compared with a year earlier.
It is not clear how much of the weakness in industrial production represents a real weakening of demand and how much reflects inventory issues. During the credit crisis, production fell much more rapidly than final demand, as companies found it hard to get financing and worried that their customers would be unable to pay for what was being shipped. Much of the revival in 2010 reflected pent-up demand, and some of the current slowing may simply show that depleted inventories have been replenished.
But the declines also provide an indication of continuing problems, particularly in some of the European countries most in need of a growing economy.
Greece's industrial production was never large to begin with, but it is now lower than at any time since the figures began to be compiled in 1995, and is down about a third from its peak, set back in 2000.
Italian production appeared to recover in line with that of other countries in 2010, but has since weakened appreciably. For much of this year, it has been down more than 6 percent from the previous year. Spain's production has fallen almost as rapidly.

HEADLINE: Drug Shortages Persist in U.S., Harming Care

BYLINE: By KATIE THOMAS

 BODY:
Paul Davis, the chief of a rural ambulance squad in southern Ohio, was down to his last vial of morphine earlier this fall when a woman with a broken leg needed a ride to the hospital.
The trip was 30 minutes, and the patient was in pain. But because of a nationwide shortage, his morphine supply had dwindled from four doses to just one, presenting Mr. Davis with a stark quandary. Should he treat the woman, who was clearly suffering? Or should he save it for a patient who might need it more?
In the end, he opted not to give her the morphine, a decision that haunts him still. ''I just feel like I'm not doing my job,'' said Mr. Davis, who is chief of the rescue squad in Vernon, Ohio. He has since refilled his supply. ''I shouldn't have to make those kinds of decisions.'' 
From rural ambulance squads to prestigious hospitals, health care workers are struggling to keep vital medicines in stock because of a drug shortage crisis that is proving to be stubbornly difficult to fix. Rationing is just one example of the extraordinary lengths being taken to address the shortage, which health care workers say has ceased to be a temporary emergency and is now a fact of life. In desperation, they are resorting to treating patients with less effective alternative medicines and using expired drugs. The Cleveland Clinic has hired a pharmacist whose only job is to track down hard-to-find drugs.
Caused largely by an array of manufacturing problems, the shortage has prompted Congressional hearings, a presidential order and pledges by generic drug makers to communicate better with federal regulators.
The problem peaked in 2011, when a record 251 drugs were declared in short supply. This year, slightly more than 100 were placed on the list, and workers say the battle to keep pharmacy shelves stocked continues unabated. The list of hard-to-find medicines ranges from basic drugs like the heart medicine nitroglycerin to a lidocaine injection, which is used to numb tissue before surgery.
A deadly meningitis outbreak caused by contamination at a large drug producer could worsen the situation, federal officials have warned. The Food and Drug Administration said that shortages of six drugs -- medicines used during surgery and to treat conditions like congestive heart failure -- could get worse after a big compounding pharmacy closed over concerns about drug safety. The pharmacy, Ameridose, shares some management with the New England Compounding Center, which is at the center of a meningitis outbreak that has claimed 33 lives.
''When you can't treat basic things -- cardiac arrest, pain management, seizures -- you're in trouble,'' said Dr. Carol Cunningham, the state medical director for the Ohio Department of Public Safety's emergency services division. ''When you only have five tools in your toolbox and three of them are gone, what do you do?''
Dr. Margaret A. Hamburg, the F.D.A. commissioner, said in an interview this week that she was ''guardedly optimistic'' that the shortage crisis was abating. ''I think there's been an enormous amount of progress,'' she said. ''We're seeing real change in the number of shortages that we're able to recognize early.'' More than 150 new shortages have been prevented this year, according to the agency.
But Erin Fox, who tracks supply levels for a broader range of drugs at the University of Utah, said once a drug became scarce, it tended to stay scarce. The university's Drug Information Service was actively tracking 282 hard-to-find products by the end of the third quarter of this year, a record.
''The shortages we have aren't going away -- they're not resolving,'' she said. ''But the good news is we're not piling more shortages on top.''
In 2011, prompted by emotional pleas by cancer patients and others who said the drug shortage was threatening lives, President Obama issued an executive order requiring drug makers to notify the F.D.A. when a shortage appeared imminent. The agency also loosened some restrictions on importing drugs, and sped up approvals by other manufacturers to make certain medicines.
A law passed this summer contains several provisions aimed at improving the situation, including expediting approval of new generic medicines and requiring the agency's enforcement unit to better coordinate with its drug-shortage officials before it takes action against a manufacturer.
Ralph G. Neas, the chief executive of the Generic Pharmaceutical Association, said fixing the drug shortage was complex and would take time, but was a top priority. ''One shortage is one shortage too many,'' he said. ''One patient not getting a critical drug is one patient too many.''
Federal drug officials trace much of the drug shortage crisis to delays at plants that make sterile injectable drugs, which account for about 80 percent of the scarce medicines. Nearly a third of the industry's manufacturing capacity is not running because of plant closings or shutdowns to fix serious quality issues. Other shortages have been caused by supply disruptions of the raw ingredients used to make the drugs, or by manufacturers exiting the market.
Some people have accused the F.D.A. of causing the shortages, saying overzealous enforcement and poor communication have led plants to close needlessly or to slow production. Others have cited economic factors, like market pressures and reimbursement policies that have set prices so low that some companies have stopped making certain drugs. Earlier this week, several Democratic members of Congress asked the Government Accountability Office to investigate whether the practices of so-called group purchasing organizations, which buy drugs on behalf of hospitals, was contributing to the shortage.
Regardless of the cause, the drug shortage has forced the F.D.A. to make some tough choices, including allowing manufacturers to sell drugs that, if it were not for the crisis, most likely would have been recalled. Last year, for example, the agency allowed the manufacturer American Regent to sell a drug used during chemotherapy that was found to contain glass particles. Doctors and nurses were instructed to filter the drug, sodium thiosulfate, before administering it to patients.
''If there wasn't a shortage, we would never allow a company to continue marketing'' in such cases, Dr. Sandra Kweder, deputy director of the F.D.A.'s office of new drugs, said. But ''patients need it.''
Dr. Hamburg said drug manufacturers had invested significantly in improving their facilities, upgrades that will ultimately help ease the crisis but that in the near term are making some shortages difficult to resolve. ''It's not going to happen overnight, but we're in the midst of a period of really, very significant change that offers great promise for the future,'' she said.
Patients like Jennifer Lacognata, a mother of two in suburban Florida, say they cannot afford to wait. She has debilitating night blindness, skin lesions and other health problems because she cannot absorb vitamin A through her diet, a rare side effect of weight-loss surgery she had years ago. In 2011, her doctor prescribed Aquasol A, a liquid form of the vitamin, to be injected into her shoulder.
But Hospira has temporarily stopped selling Aquasol A after it decided to move manufacturing of the product from an outside company to one of its plants. The company recently decided to abort the plan, citing complex technical challenges, and now has a deal with another company to begin making the vitamin.
Ms. Lacognata sued Hospira unsuccessfully to try to compel the company to make it again.
A company spokeswoman said Hospira recognized the critical need for Aquasol A and was ''working diligently'' to return it to the market, but declined to provide an estimate of when.
Given that the delays have stretched for more than a year, Ms. Lacognata said she was not holding her breath. ''If they don't get their act together and do this, they're not going to suffer,'' she said. ''They're still going to be making millions of dollars. It's the little guy in the end who ends up with nothing.''

HEADLINE: When the Great Plains Dried Up and Blew Away

BYLINE: By MIKE HALE

 BODY:
Given how long it takes Ken Burns to finance, assemble and promote his documentaries, the timing of ''The Dust Bowl'' is eerily appropriate. It arrives on Sunday on PBS in the middle of a spate of quickly produced programs about Hurricane Sandy and climate change, as if Mr. Burns knew that this would be just the right moment for a cautionary story about human interference with the environment.
The parallels, if you accept them, are striking. An artificial phenomenon -- in this case the rapid uprooting of millions of acres of prairie grass for the cultivation of wheat -- contributes to a series of huge storms that eventually drives out 25 percent of the population of the affected area in the southern Great Plains. There is a qualified happy ending: farming practices change, a decade-long drought ends in the late 1930s, and life returns to normal, the promises of the land boom that led to the crisis long forgotten. 
Mr. Burns presents the story in his usual manner, as a carefully stitched patchwork of vintage photos and film, historical commentary (one of the experts is the New York Times columnist Timothy Egan) and eyewitness accounts held together by the narration of Peter Coyote, whose aw-shucks tones have graced previous Burns films about Prohibition and the national parks.
''The Dust Bowl'' is short by Burns standards, four hours over two nights (Sunday and Monday), but his films can seem too long at any length -- the deliberate pace and unvaried rhythm shade into monotony, and you wish that 18 hours were 12, or 4 hours were 3. That's true to some extent of ''The Dust Bowl,'' even though there's more than enough material, from land rush to Depression, drought, mass migration and New Deal agricultural policies, to fill the time.
But Mr. Burns has two aces up his sleeve in ''The Dust Bowl.'' One is the copious supply of photographs and film of the dust storms themselves, awesome and apocalyptic images he can put on screen whenever we need a visual jolt.
The other is his cast of living witnesses, white-haired survivors who in the 1930s were children growing up in the Oklahoma panhandle or southern Kansas and Colorado. Their first-person accounts of how they and their parents handled the double catastrophes, physical and financial, of the dust storms and the Depression give the film a human element that's not always present, or possible, in Mr. Burns's work. (Attesting to the length of time these documentaries require, an end credit notes that four of the interview subjects have died.)
The story of the Dust Bowl is complicated, twisting together ecology, economics and politics, as well as divisions of class and region, and Mr. Burns and his writer, Dayton Duncan, have done as careful and admirable a job as you would expect in laying it out.
They also express a point of view -- implicitly in their storytelling, and explicitly in the testimony of the Dust Bowl children -- that the large-scale federal aid and intervention carried out under Franklin D. Roosevelt's watch were a practical and moral imperative. That will probably be less controversial now than it would have been a few weeks ago.
Mr. Burns may not have envisioned his film as a case study in the government's response to an ecological crisis, but as they say, no one can predict the weather.

HEADLINE: Industrial Production in U.S. Falls After Storm's Disruption

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Industrial production fell unexpectedly in October because of Hurricane Sandy, the Federal Reserve reported on Friday, but factory growth appeared at a standstill even aside from the storm.
Production at the nation's mines, factories and refineries contracted 0.4 percent last month, after a 0.2 percent increase in September, the Fed said. It said the storm, which hit the East Coast at the end of October, cut output by nearly 1 percentage point. Utilities and producers of chemicals, food, transportation equipment, and computers and electronic products were the most affected, it said. 
Still, the gain in output last month would have been modest even without the storm, with fears about the possibility of higher taxes and sharp cuts in government spending early next year making businesses hesitant to raise output and invest.
Those measures would drain about $600 billion from the economy unless Congress and the Obama administration agree on a plan to soften the blow.
Industrial output contracted in the third quarter for the first time since the 2007-9 recession ended, a hard landing is not expected for the industrial sector.
Economists are divided on whether industrial output will bounce back in November. Some expect the effects of the storm to linger longer.
''Sandy's impact is also likely to be felt in the November industrial production data as power outages and other disruptions in the Northeast persisted into the second week of the month,'' said Jeremy Lawson, an economist at BNP Paribas in New York.
Last month, utilities output fell 0.1 percent, even though parts of the Northeast lost power during the storm. Utilities production was flat in September. Production at mines increased 1.5 percent after rising 0.9 percent the previous month.
The amount of factory capacity in use -- a measure of how fully firms are using their resources -- slipped 0.8 of a point, to 75.9 percent in October, the lowest level since November 2011.

HEADLINE: E.P.A. Upholds Federal Mandate for Ethanol in Gasoline

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Environmental Protection Agency declined on Friday to relax its requirement on the use of corn ethanol in gasoline, rejecting a request from several states related to a steep decline in the nation's corn production. 
A summer drought that withered crops led to a spike in prices, hurting the livestock industry and others that depend on corn for food. Estimates indicate that as much as half of the nation's crop will be used to produce ethanol this year to meet the federal renewable energy standard for transportation fuel.
''We recognize that this year's drought has created hardship in some sectors of the economy, particularly for livestock producers,'' Gina McCarthy, an E.P.A. assistant administrator, said in a statement. ''But our extensive analysis makes clear that Congressional requirements for a waiver have not been met.''
To approve a change in the standard, the agency would have to conclude that the fuel rule would ''severely harm'' the economy. The E.P.A. said it had analyzed 500 potential market variations and that most of them showed no impact from the use of corn for ethanol; those that did showed an average impact of 7 cents a bushel, less than 1 percent of the price, it said.
A coalition of livestock groups expressed frustration with the decision, as did the National Council of Chain Restaurants, which says its costs have also risen because of the use of corn in ethanol production.
Several environmental groups are also opposed to the ethanol requirement, saying that corn ethanol production is not clean energy. ''If the worst U.S. drought in more than 50 years and skyrocketing food prices are not enough to make E.P.A. act, it falls to Congress to provide relief from our senseless federal support for corn ethanol,'' Michal Rosenoer, a biofuels specialist at Friends of the Earth, said in a statement. She said the mandate was ''exacerbating our economic and environmental problems.''
That would put some environmentalists in rare alignment with the oil industry, which is required to use an increasing amount of ethanol in its fuel production but complains that its system is glutted with the substance.
Since Congress specified a year-by-year gallon quota for biofuels in 2007, total fuel demand in the United States has dropped, so the percentage of ethanol fuel in gasoline has reached unexpected highs.
Farm groups and trade associations for companies seeking to make ethanol from nonfood sources like wood chips or crop residues have applauded the mandate, however. They say that if the corn ethanol mandate is reduced, there will be less demand for their biofuels products as well.
At the Advanced Ethanol Council, Brooke Coleman, the executive director, pointed out that the quota rules include a provision that allows the oil industry to postpone up to 20 percent of its obligation to a future year ''if there is a good year one year and a less good year the next.''
At Novozymes, which supplies enzymes to ethanol manufacturers, Adam Monroe, president of the company's North American division, said the biofuels mandate ''has generated 400,000 careers, billions in private investment, and domestic, renewable fuel for America.''
In the longer term, Congress anticipates substantial production of biofuels from nonfood sources, but so far that has not developed.

HEADLINE: At Bipartisan Budget Meeting, Familiar Hurdles but a New Attitude

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES and JONATHAN WEISMAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama and Congressional leaders on Friday reopened budget negotiations that ended badly in 2011 with surprising bipartisan bonhomie, and even some initial agreements toward a year-end deal. Yet a familiar hurdle remains before any handshakes: resolving the parties' dispute over whether to extend the Bush-era tax rates for the wealthy.
Both sides indicated after the 70-minute White House meeting that their goal is a two-step compromise, since they have little time to work before the end of the year. That is when more than $500 billion in automatic tax increases and across-the-board spending cuts hit all Americans, and potentially shake the economy, unless Congress enacts an alternative deficit reduction agreement.
As tentatively envisioned, a compromise would provide an immediate down payment of at least $50 billion to reduce this year's projected deficit, in lieu of the automatic measures that would hurt the economy by their size and suddenness, economists say. Second, it would define a framework for negotiating a long-term ''grand bargain'' in 2013 to shave annual deficits by perhaps $4 trillion over the first decade. 
The framework would have separate goals for raising revenues and cutting the two types of federal spending: so-called discretionary financing that Congress sets annually for most programs, domestic and military; and entitlement spending, chiefly for Medicare and Medicaid, which by their growth in an aging population are driving projections of mounting debt.
The agreement to aim for a framework only in the initial talks is a quick step forward. Some lawmakers, including the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, had wanted a larger deal before Jan. 1 as the price for shutting off the automatic deficit reduction that would hit then. Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader, went so far as to predict that a deal to head off that so-called fiscal cliff would be at hand ''well before Christmas.''
While such a two-pronged deal would put off the hardest and most far-reaching policy decisions until next year, no deal is possible unless the negotiators first decide on the deficit down payment. That installment, it is widely believed, must be large enough to satisfy financial markets, which oppose the automatic measures as too large and threatening but still want Washington to show some resolve toward getting the nation's fiscal house in order.
Mr. Obama, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and the Democrats -- Harry Reid of Nevada, the Senate majority leader, and Ms. Pelosi -- made it clear around the negotiating table that the down payment is easily made by letting the Bush tax cuts expire, as scheduled on Dec. 31, for annual income of $250,000 and above for couples and $200,000 for individuals. The Bush rates would be extended for lower incomes, preserving them for 98 percent of taxpayers.
The Republicans -- House Speaker John A. Boehner and Mr. McConnell -- were just as plain that, while they support raising additional revenues by curbing deductions and through economic growth, they would oppose an increase in marginal tax rates. They want the down payment in spending cuts.
Yet after an election campaign in which Mr. Obama made this a top issue, Republicans have reduced leverage, many acknowledge. That shift in the Washington fiscal dynamic since Mr. Obama's re-election also explains the rapidity with which the Republican leaders have agreed that higher revenues will be part of the deficit-reduction solution -- if not through higher rates.
If the president has his way, the top rates, now 33 percent and 35 percent, would rise to 36 percent and 39.6 percent, the Clinton-era levels, on Jan. 1. But Mr. Obama has suggested he is open to a compromise that would set the rates somewhere in between, in combination with limits on deductions.
With Mr. Obama leaving on Saturday for a four-day diplomatic trip to Asia and Thanksgiving looming, the negotiators directed their staffs to flush out the Republican bottom line on the size and type of savings to get from Medicare and Medicaid in preparation for the leaders' next meeting in the week after the holiday.
Republicans were heartened that Mr. Obama designated his soon-to-retire Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, as his lead negotiator, instead of the White House chief of staff, Jacob J. Lew. Mr. Boehner's relations with Mr. Lew soured during the prolonged and bitter budget talks in 2011.
The four Congressional leaders emerged from the West Wing round table together and in good spirits -- a far cry from the 2011 negotiations, when they generally left separately and, once back at the Capitol, circulated competing versions of the private discussions. Mr. Reid virtually promised a deal before a Dec. 31 deadline that would avoid the last-minute brinkmanship so typical of Congress's budget debates in recent years.
''We feel very comfortable with each other, and this isn't something we're going to wait until the last day of December to get it done,'' Mr. Reid said. ''We have the cornerstones of being able to work something out. We're both going to have to give up some of the things that we know are a problem.''
Mr. Boehner said he outlined a framework for overhauling the tax code and spending programs that is ''consistent with the president's call for a fair and balanced approach.''
''To show our seriousness,'' he said, ''we put revenue on the table as long as it's accompanied by significant spending cuts.''
Mr. McConnell made plain that Republicans were talking about Medicare and Medicaid spending. Republican senators, he said, ''fully understand that you can't save the country until you have entitlement programs that fit the demographics of the changing America in the coming years.''
''We're prepared to put revenues on the table,'' he said, ''provided we fix the real problem, even though most of my members, I think without exception, believe that we're in the dilemma we're in not because we tax too little but because we spend too much.''
Ms. Pelosi, whose colleagues include many liberals who resist significant changes to entitlement spending, said: ''We understand our responsibility here. We understand that it has to be about cuts, it has to be about revenue, it has to be about growth, it has to be about the future.''
She added, ''I feel confident that a solution may be in sight.''
The talks also began on a friendly note: With reporters and cameras briefly allowed in the room, Mr. Obama wished a happy birthday to Mr. Boehner, who turns 63 on Saturday. The president gave the speaker, who favors merlot, a bottle of 1997 brunello wine, a pricey Italian red.

HEADLINE: No Picassos, but Plenty of Off-the-Wall Bargains

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY

 BODY:
Beginning on Saturday, the Museum of Modern Art will hold a garage sale in its atrium. It will not be a ''garage sale'' -- a piece of performance art in which a garage sale is enacted, or an exhibition using conceptual instruments of value to interrogate Marx's theory of commodity fetishism.
It will be a place where you can buy a pair of secondhand snow skis or a functional toilet tank or a Barack Obama commemorative plate ($23) or an unused SpongeBob SquarePants alarm clock ($18). Or, if the price is right, you might even leave with a good set of Noritake china once owned by the mother of Martha Rosler, the creator and proprietor of the garage sale, who was unboxing the pieces on Monday afternoon and noted that they were not just for show.
''No, no, I hope somebody buys them,'' she said, adding: ''Jewish women always have four sets of dishes. I've got way too many.'' 
Of course, because the dishes and some 14,000 other things Ms. Rosler has amassed over the last year will be sold in the heart of one of the most powerful art institutions in the world, they can never be just garage sale items. And the sale cannot avoid being a performance, a Conceptual installation, an institutional critique and a loaded metaphor in a place filled with hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of objects that have, at least theoretically, departed the commercial realm for good.
But Ms. Rosler -- an artist whose work is often about the personal made political (and vice versa), and who has been holding art world garage sales like this for almost 40 years -- said the only way to make the events interesting as art has been for them to be as much as possible like every other garage sale in America.
''It's not symbolic activity,'' she said. ''It's real activity. Like most things, it has symbolic dimensions. But it is what it is.''
What it is is a sale that will cover most of the roomy atrium -- home in past years to works by artists like Monet, Barnett Newman and Jennifer Bartlett -- with a mishmash of previously owned merchandise, some of it Ms. Rosler's, and the rest donated by museum employees, fellow artists and the public. With the exception of Thanksgiving Day and Tuesdays, when the museum is closed, it will go from noon to 5 p.m. daily (noon to 7:30 p.m. on Fridays), and 200 people at a time will be allowed into the sale area.
Together with the museum's admission -- $25 for adults -- the prices might seem a little steep, but, well, it's New York. And Ms. Rosler, who priced most of the things herself, said it was also a practical matter: she was afraid that if prices were too low, things would sell too quickly, and she'd be left with a garage sale not worth stopping for.
''I don't want people to be disappointed,'' she said. ''I'm serious.'' (The proceeds go to charity.)
Her fascination with garage sales -- as portraits, through possessions, of the people who hold them; as economic end runs engineered mostly by women; as suburban sacrament and social gathering -- goes back to seeing them for the first time after moving to California in the 1970s.
''I grew up in Crown Heights, and nobody would have ever thought of putting their things in front of their houses to sell,'' said Ms. Rosler, 69. ''Your neighbors would have thought you were crazy. It would have been deeply embarrassing.'' Stoop sales, now common in New York, are what she calls a ''back-formation.''
She has put on the sales around the world, collecting things in each locale and sometimes selling profoundly personal things, like her son's baby shoes and used diaphragms. (Showing a photograph of merchandise recently, she said: ''This is from Barcelona. This is from Vienna. This is my nightgown.'')
Ms. Rosler had decided it was about time to pull down the garage door for good when Sabine Breitwieser, MoMA's chief curator of media and performance art, approached her with an offer she could not refuse.
''I said, 'What if you did the sale in the atrium of the museum?' '' Ms. Breitwieser recalled. ''I thought it would be the epitome of a performance.'' She added: ''Art is, after all, a kind of pinnacle of the idea of the value of objects.''
The show, bombastically titled ''Meta-Monumental Garage Sale,'' is part of the museum's embrace of performance -- broadly defined -- in recent years and another signal that it is trying to address criticism that it has too long underrepresented women in its story of art made over the last century and a half.
Ms. Rosler, who once referred to MoMA in an essay as ''the Kremlin of Modernism,'' said she was happy for the chance to open up shop there. ''I don't really feel antagonism,'' she said, standing beneath a huge American flag draped over the atrium for the show. ''But if you look at the history of this place, of course there's antagonism here.''
She added: ''For a long time MoMA has insisted, in its practice, on its distance from the streets, if you will. They're still a little uncertain about how to enter the 21st century.''
At times, she said, she felt as if the gods of institutional art had decided not to let her have a MoMA spotlight.
The Brooklyn warehouse where she had collected all the sale items became inaccessible for more than a week after Hurricane Sandy knocked out its power. The New Jersey facility where cloth items were to be fumigated -- to ensure that tiny bugs didn't end up wandering the museum, eating paintings -- was taken out of commission by the storm. So the museum had to rent refrigerated trucks to freeze the things. As all this was happening, the boiler in Ms. Rosler's home in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, conked out for good, leaving her with no heat.
Then, to top it off, a few days before the show was to open, she lost a crown. Pulling it out of her purse, in a plastic bag, she said she didn't know when she would have time to get to a dentist to have it replaced.
And she needed to be on her game once the show opened, she said. One of the most important elements of any good garage sale is the art of the haggle, which she approaches with the zeal of a used-car dealer trying to make quota. (There will, in fact, be a used car for sale, along with a washing machine, a refrigerator, a sink, a few sofas and about 40 chairs.)
''The things that are up on the wall, especially the things that are hanging low, people always really seem to want,'' she said. ''I can usually tell by their faces. So I give them a lot of grief. And sometimes I sell. And sometimes I don't.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Making Mountains, Not Molehills

BYLINE: By ANAND GIRIDHARADAS

 BODY:
NEW YORK -- America just spent billions of dollars and man-hours on an election that basically returned the same players to the same roles, albeit with some significant tweaks. Perhaps those tweaks -- and the realization that President Barack Obama won by stitching together a new coalition -- are why the election is bearing unexpected fruit: There are flickers of deal-making in a gridlocked Washington. Compromise is in the air.
As yet, the compromises seem small, particularly when measured against the challenge -- sparing the United States the fate of becoming a slightly less-than-first-world country. 
Talking of Republicans perhaps willing to raise taxes on the rich (and not just tax rates) or Democrats willing to cut entitlement programs is less than inspiring to many Americans weary of the haggling ways of Washington. And without popular backing, leaders lack the mandate -- or, more cynically, the cover -- required to push through major changes or make significant pivots.
Washington's afflictions have deep, complex roots. But a small part of the problem may lie in how it mentally constructs its work, fixating on tasks rather than causes.
Each issue -- the payroll tax, health care, renewable energy -- is imagined to be its own little island. Divisions over each island are straightforward, well-rehearsed and difficult to overcome.
What if Washington were to conceive of its work differently, as pursuing missions rather than the laws required to fulfill them, or building archipelagos, not islands?
Instead of the individual policy being the unit of analysis, the governing class might agree to pursue a few vast national projects that exploit what commonalities they have and are vital to the country's health. It could commit to these initiatives up front, through congressional resolutions and presidential signatures, which would include agreed-upon metrics to judge success. Then it could work out the specific policies required to fulfill them.
What might some of these national missions be?
One might be an aggressive campaign on behalf of the equality of opportunity. For the left, it's part of a wider pursuit of equality; for the right, it's the only kind of equality worth pursuing and the logical foundation of its laissez-faire agenda. Importantly, while the two sides disagree vehemently on equality for adults, they agree substantially on equality for children and its corollary, social mobility.
Jeb Bush, the former Republican governor of Florida, has said: ''The sad truth is that equality of opportunity doesn't exist in many of our schools. We give some kids a chance, but not all. That failure is the great moral and economic issue of our time.''
This initiative might inspire a variety of policy responses -- on schools, welfare, the estate tax, college loans. But the measure of success would not be the passage of any particular piece of legislation. It would be how well the talent-to-opportunity matching machine works for the poor, the middle class and businesses, and whether America stops being the rare rich country where parents' income can be used reliably to predict one's own.
A second national mission might be an effort to shore up the family. The complex weave of issues bearing on the family routinely are addressed piecemeal -- gay marriage, the war on drugs, abortion, abstinence education, welfare requirements, contraception access, the marriage tax penalty, the child tax credit, mortgage tax breaks for homeowners. On this individual level, the arguments are familiar and often go nowhere.
But there is widespread acknowledgement among scholars today, from Robert D. Putnam on the left to Charles A. Murray on the right, that the American family is undergoing something of a collapse. Births to unwed mothers are soaring, without any of the social supports of, say, Sweden. What crack cocaine once did to black inner-city communities, methamphetamine and pills are now doing to rural and suburban white ones. Meanwhile, the quality of one's early family life has been shown to be among the most important determinants of later success.
Liberals tend to blame social and economic structures for this breakdown, while conservatives often cite poor choices and moral failure. But there is enough agreement on the diagnosis for a grand initiative of family renewal. And that initiative could then encompass everything from updating marriage laws (Who gets to marry? What incentives, if any, should the married receive?) to deciding whether it hurts or helps families to require drug tests as a condition for receiving welfare.
You could dream up any number of such sweeping initiatives. Radical modernization of government, for instance, for the digital age. Increase cost-effectiveness but also impact; use the Web and mobile apps to empower citizens and to help them solve some problems without turning to government; copy the nonprofit sector by embracing its use of cutting-edge work in monitoring effectiveness and evaluating outcomes.
Or a big project to restore the American commercial spirit and the small-time capitalist striver. That embraces all kinds of policy questions: Should we grant visas to start-up founders? Break up the big banks? Ease regulations on small businesses? Favor job-creating companies over ones whose success is built on labor overseas?
The logic of this bundling is simple enough: It makes a forest of trees. It turns a handful of distinct policies into a single, animating cause. It frees politicians to go beyond the particulars of what they're legislating, and to remember what they're legislating for.

HEADLINE: The Israel-Palestine Conflict Won't Go Away

BYLINE: By YOSSI ALPHER

 BODY:
Tel Aviv
THE Israel-Hamas clash in and around the Gaza Strip offers an important reminder to the second Obama administration: You can ignore the Israeli-Palestinian conflict for only so long.
You can, with wishful thinking, derogate that conflict to a low priority on your list of Middle East tasks -- well below Iran, Syria, Afghanistan and the democratizing of political Islam. But it will contrive to bounce right back up to the top of your list.
Currently, the administration confronts two urgent developments related to the conflict: the Gaza fighting and the determination of the Palestinian Authority leader, Mahmoud Abbas, to seek U.N. General Assembly recognition of Palestine as a quasi-state. 
Washington's natural inclination is to fall back on shopworn formulas for pushing these issues back off the immediate agenda: another Egyptian-mediated cease-fire, however temporary, in Gaza; and promises to Abbas that if he just backs away from the U.N. the administration will sponsor yet again discussion of the Oslo-begotten formula for a two-state solution.
These tactics might even work for a while, at least until the new administration gets organized and Israel gets through its Jan. 22 elections. But they are just that: tactics. They reflect the prolonged absence in Washington, Jerusalem and Arab capitals of a viable and realistic strategy for dealing with the Palestinian issue in all its complexity.
Looking at the Gaza Strip, five years of economic blockade failed to weaken or moderate Hamas, while giving Israel a bad name. Military reoccupation is justifiably shunned by Israel as counterproductive; every incursion into the Strip has a quick exit plan. Hamas refuses to talk with Israel and Israel, backed by Washington, refuses to talk with Hamas.
Now, with the support of Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood government and the deep pockets of the Qataris, Hamas feels more confident than ever, despite the bashing it has received from Israel. It confronts us with the specter, in a best-case scenario, of a three-state solution. In a worst-case scenario, its provocations could bring Egypt and Israel to the brink of dangerous armed tensions.
Turning to the West Bank, where the Palestinian Authority is close to bankrupt and the P.L.O. still pretends it can represent Gaza in the U.N. and in talks with Israel, the absence of substantive negotiations for the past four years points to the effective demise of the Oslo process, the strategy of the past 20 years.
The failure of the Olmert-Abbas talks back in September 2008 was far more than a tactical setback. In retrospect, it must be understood as a reflection of the parties' true inability to bridge their ''narrative'' gaps regarding refugee right of return and the Temple Mount in Jerusalem. Under these sad circumstances, ''Just get to the damn table'' (Leon Panetta, Dec. 2, 2011) is not a strategy for resolving this conflict. These issues will not go away.
The coming months of transition in Washington provide a unique opportunity to review failed strategies in the Israeli-Palestinian context and examine new ones, even if the objective is stabilization and limited progress rather than an elusive end-of-conflict.
For starters? West Bank unilateral-withdrawal proposals by the Israeli political center and strategic think tanks deserve serious consideration.
The new Egyptian leadership could be pressed by Washington to persuade Hamas to negotiate directly with Israel, where many would welcome this opportunity.
And conceivably, Abbas's U.N. initiative could be leveraged into a useful ''win-win'' formula for partial progress toward a two-state framework.

HEADLINE: Rising Hopes For Budget End Slide On Wall St.

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Optimism that President Obama and Congressional leaders will reach a deal on the budget deficit helped stocks notch their first advance in four days on Friday.
Wall Street fell early, but began to climb before midday, as leading senators and representatives spoke at the White House after a closed-door session with the president. The House speaker, John A. Boehner, and Mitch McConnell, the Senate minority leader, both said that they offered higher tax revenue as part of a deal. Mr. Boehner said he outlined a framework consistent with Mr. Obama's call for a ''balanced'' approach of both higher revenue and spending cuts. 
''It's a good start,'' said Ben Schwartz, the chief market strategist at Lightspeed Financial, a brokerage firm in New York.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 45.93 points, or 0.4 percent, at 12,588.31, after falling as much as 71 points at midmorning. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 6.55 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,359.88, and the Nasdaq rose 16.19 points, or 0.6 percent, to 2,853.13.
Stocks have been slipping since Election Day, as investors worried that leaders in Washington would not come to an agreement on fiscal measures. Stocks fell on Wednesday after Mr. Obama insisted that higher taxes on wealthy Americans would have to be part of any deal and that he would not cave to Republicans who have pressed for tax cuts first passed by President George W. Bush to be extended for all income earners.
The Dow was down 5 percent since Nov. 6. If an agreement is not reached, automatic government spending cuts and tax increases are set to kick in at the beginning of next year. The measures total about $700 billion for 2013 and could send the country back into recession.
Mitch Stapley, chief investment officer at Fifth Third Asset Management, said that investors and traders were likely to be in for a rough ride until the politicians broker a deal. ''It's going to be a very choppy period coming up,'' said Mr. Stapley, who is based in Grand Rapids, Mich.
The Dow still ended lower for the week, logging a fourth straight weekly decline. That slump has pared the index's gains for the year to 3 percent. The S.& P. 500 also ended the week lower, and has fallen in three of the last four weeks.
Mixed earnings reports also weighed on stocks.
Shares of Dell fell 70 cents, or 7.3 percent, to $8.86. The company is struggling as PC users switch to tablets and smartphones. Dell said that its revenue might fall as much as 13 percent in the fourth quarter.
Sears stock fell $10.99, or 19 percent, to $47.49, after the retailer said that sales at both its Kmart and Sears stores continued to tumble.
The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 3/32, to 100 12/32, and the yield edged down to 1.58 percent, from 1.59 percent late Thursday.

HEADLINE: A Man of Fashion Is Still Stylish, but His Pockets Are Old and Empty

BYLINE: By EWA KERN-JEDRYCHOWSKA

 BODY:
Tyrone Freeman looks as if he is dressed for a fashion show. His crisp, dark suit pairs nicely with his orange shirt. In turn, his shirt is perfectly matched with orange-framed glasses.
''I've always had an eye for fashion and always liked to put colors and different patterns together,'' Mr. Freeman said. As a child, he said, he wanted to be a fashion designer, and he ended up spending 24 years working in various positions for department stores.
But his colorful clothes, which he bought in times of prosperity, are something of a disguise: he is thousands of dollars in debt and lives in a basement apartment adjacent to the Queensbridge Houses, a public housing complex, in Long Island City, Queens. 
His apartment is so small, he said, it can barely fit two people at the same time. He prefers to spend time at a nearby park.
''This is my home,'' he said of Queensbridge Park, along the East River, with sweeping views of Manhattan.
Mr. Freeman, 45, the divorced father of two adult sons, is still recovering from 13 months of unemployment, after losing his job as an associate merchandising director at Saks Fifth Avenue in Midtown Manhattan, he said.
He spent 15 years at Saks, where he started as a supervisor in the cosmetics and fragrances section, making about $30,000 a year.
He worked his way up the ranks, doubling his salary when he was promoted to oversee two floors of merchandise, including the home, gift and children's departments.
Before working at Saks, Mr. Freeman spent nine years at Macy's as a stock associate and later coordinating merchandise documentation there.
He said he would never forget the Friday morning, April 15, 2011, when he and seven others in Saks management were laid off.
It was the first time in his adult life that he did not have a job. And he was not the type to sit at home. ''I knew right away that I wanted to get back into the market,'' he said.
So the next Monday he went to the East River Development Alliance, a job-training program and partner agency of the Community Service Society of New York, one of the agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.
He was familiar with the alliance through its work in his Long Island City neighborhood and had become friends with its founder, Bishop Mitchell G. Taylor, who is also the senior pastor at Center of Hope International, the church Mr. Freeman attends.
At the alliance, he took a series of workshops in which he learned the ins and outs of a job search.
A lot had changed since he had last looked for work, something he thought he would never have to do again.
''On my prior rsum, I didn't even have an e-mail address,'' he said.
He updated his rsum and was shown what skills to emphasize when filling out different kinds of employment applications, and he went through several mock interviews.
Eventually, Mr. Freeman sent his new rsum to dozens of companies, with the goal of applying for 10 to 15 jobs a week.
He worked out a system: he scheduled interviews on Mondays and Tuesdays, and toward the end of the week he would look for new job listings.
Persistent and aggressive, his efforts led to about 15 interviews and some callbacks for second interviews. Several companies required four-part interviews.
But no one hired him.
The competition was fierce, and the fact that he had only two years of college, and no degree, did not help.
At some point, while he was living on his unemployment benefits, he realized that he would have to adjust his salary expectations. There were moments when he felt depressed, he said.
''It doesn't happen on your time,'' he said about finding a job.
But he never gave up. He went to Queensbridge Park and filled out even more applications.
Finally, in May, after more than a year without work and his unemployment benefits exhausted, he received a job offer from K&G Fashion, a clothing retailer that was looking for an assistant store manager for its new location in Jamaica, Queens.
By then however, his savings were long gone, and his debt had mounted into the thousands of dollars.
In June, using a grant from The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, the Community Service Society provided Mr. Freeman a 30-day unlimited-use MetroCard, valued at $104; it enabled him to commute to his new job.
It may not sound like much, but for Mr. Freeman, not having to worry about how he could afford to get to work was a big help.
''When you are living off unemployment and you are starting a new job, it's a lot,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Whodunit at Police Headquarters: Occupy Accuses Police

BYLINE: By J. DAVID GOODMAN

 BODY:
The pair of barriers, which looked like heavy concrete obstacles, seemed out of place in the 13th-floor hallway of Police Headquarters in Lower Manhattan. Spotted on Wednesday, the barriers had the aura of something official, white with blue writing in a font favored by the New York Police Department. But upon closer inspection, the messages told a different story. 
''OWS,'' read the big blue letters on one.
''Protecting the people from the powerful,'' read the other.
The appearance of the barriers -- made of plastic foam, not stone, according to one officer -- roughly coincided with the first anniversary of a minutely planned police raid that cleared Occupy Wall Street protesters from their encampment in Zuccotti Park on Nov. 15, 2011.
The barriers at Police Headquarters were placed near the entrance to the office of Joseph J. Esposito, the chief of department. Chief Esposito, the department's highest-ranking uniformed officer, was seen on video yelling orders and jabbing protesters with his baton during clashes in March.
Paul J. Browne, the department's chief spokesman, whose office is on the 13th floor, described the fake barriers as ''wry humor'' and said they had been placed there in the last few weeks. ''Author unknown,'' he wrote in an e-mail Thursday.
Two months ago, hundreds of protesters marked the anniversary of the Occupy Wall Street movement, which began on Sept. 17, 2011, by trying to block access to the New York Stock Exchange.
Among the signs and props seen that day were what appeared to be lightweight, fake-concrete barriers that strongly resembled the pair in Police Headquarters, with the same message in the same blue writing.
''That's our stuff,'' said Beka Economopoulos, a member of an artists' collective that was active at Occupy Wall Street protests. ''I don't know how it got there,'' she said, looking at pictures of the barriers at Police Headquarters, ''but that is our stuff.''
She said the police confiscated them during the protest around Zuccotti Park and guarded them until the protesters dispersed.
Mr. Browne declined to clarify the origin of those on the 13th floor, a stone's throw from the area of the building where reporters go to seek official information on police activity, and did not respond to a request for comment on Ms. Economopoulos's claim.
And by Friday morning, the barriers had disappeared.

HEADLINE: President Obama Goes to Asia

 BODY:
President Obama leaves on Saturday for a trip to Asia that will show his commitment to having the United States engage more intensely with countries there. But it comes at an awkward time. Israel and Hamas are at war in Gaza, and efforts to end the violence are demanding Mr. Obama's attention. The Middle East is likely to remain a top priority, but he is right to also focus on Asia, where China's growing assertiveness presents a challenge. 
The trip to Thailand, Myanmar and Cambodia should give President Obama a chance to expand on an approach to Asia that has been seen as too security-oriented at the expense of trade and economic matters. When he announced his pivot to Asia in 2011, it was a sign that the United States was not ceding anything to China. Since then, most of the attention has been on expanded military cooperation, including an agreement to base 2,500 Marines in Australia. The administration also promised to deploy 60 percent of its naval forces in the Pacific by 2020, up from about 50 percent today. The Washington Post reported on Friday that the Pentagon is training a counterterrorism battalion in Cambodia, though that country has not faced a serious militant threat in nearly a decade.
The White House says its new strategy toward Asia will focus on many fronts, including regional institutions, emerging democracies and trade relationships. Mr. Obama will be the first American president to visit Myanmar, which has made remarkable progress over the past two years in moving from military rule to a more open political system. But there is far to go. He should nudge authorities to release all political prisoners and end ethnic conflicts, especially with the Rohingya Muslims. Mr. Obama will attend the East Asia Summit in Cambodia, whose prime minister, Hun Sen, has ruled for two decades, resulting in countless killings and abuses, according to Human Rights Watch. Mr. Obama should speak forcefully about the importance of political reform and human rights.
Of course, security issues cannot be ignored when nationalism and growing mistrust among Asian nations are raising tensions and threatening regional economic progress. The most serious is the dispute between China and Japan over some small islands in the East China Sea, and the oil and gas resources around them, that some experts fear could result in violence.
In Cambodia, President Obama will have two scheduled bilateral meetings, one with the Chinese prime minister, Wen Jiabao, and another with Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda of Japan. He should make a strong case to them to resolve their dispute. If prolonged or intensified, the consequences could be significant, impeding economic growth and regional stability.

HEADLINE: Gulf Coast States at Odds On Penalties for Oil Spill

BYLINE: By CAMPBELL ROBERTSON; John Schwartz contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
NEW ORLEANS -- With BP's agreement on Thursday to plead guilty to 14 criminal charges and pay $4.5 billion in fines and other payments in connection with its 2010 oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, Gulf Coast politicians are now eyeing a much bigger potential windfall from the company: $20 billion or more in civil pollution penalties for the spill.
But the negotiations over those penalties -- including which states get the money, how quickly, and what it can be used for -- could be more contentious than the talks that led to the criminal settlement. 
Officials with the Justice Department, who are leading the discussions, are not simply representing the federal government, but a number of other governments, including those of the five gulf states. And not only do some states have a different vision of a just settlement than federal officials do, they also disagree among one another. In some cases, leaders within a single state cannot agree on the best course of action.
All those differences have complicated progress toward a civil settlement, according to several people with knowledge of the discussions. On Thursday, both BP and the Justice Department said they intended to take the matter to trial in late February.
''Greed has always tripped up individuals and companies and states,'' said Representative Jo Bonner, a Republican whose district includes the Alabama coastline. ''We should be unified in holding the Department of Justice's feet to the fire, just like they said they were holding BP's feet to the fire.''
Under the criminal settlement, $2.4 billion paid by BP will go to environmental restoration, overseen by the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, a nonprofit organization created by Congress. Projects in Louisiana will get half the money, and the rest will be split among the other gulf states -- Florida, Alabama, Mississippi and Texas.
There are two significant varieties of civil remedies to come from the spill: penalties under the Clean Water Act and claims under the Natural Resources Damage Assessment. A settlement would most likely include some payments through both mechanisms, though the difficult question is how much would be paid out under which one. And there is intense disagreement over which is preferable.
Under the Natural Resources Damage Assessment process, which arose out of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, state and federal agencies total the environmental harm caused by the spill and send the responsible party a bill. All the money is administered by federal agencies and must be spent on environmental recovery. And the penalties, which could run in the tens of billions of dollars in the BP case, are tax-deductible for the polluter.
Payments under this process are directly tied to environmental damages, so a related BP settlement would benefit Louisiana the most, since that state experienced and continues to experience the worst of the spill.
For this reason, Garret Graves, the chief coastal adviser to Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, said that pathway could be the most helpful for the coast. ''Under N.R.D.A., 100 percent of the money goes to the gulf for recovery,'' he said.
The drawback is that the assessment can take years, and must be arrived at through findings by different scientists, which can vary widely.
The Clean Water Act calls for a penalty based on the number of barrels spilled, with much higher damages to be awarded if the polluter is found to have been grossly negligent in causing the spill. In the past, the money from these penalties, which in the BP case could add up to $21 billion, would go to the United States Treasury.
But in June, Congress passed a law, called the Restore Act, which directed that four-fifths of the penalty money in the BP spill be divided up among the gulf states, to be spent mostly outside federal control.
The passage of the Restore Act required quite a bit of horse trading, particularly in a Congress not known for demonstrations of bipartisanship.
Senator Mary Landrieu, the Louisiana Democrat who was lead sponsor of the act, maintained that her state had felt the brunt of the spill, but she arrived at a compromise with other gulf state lawmakers. Of the money that goes to the gulf states, 35 percent would be divided evenly among them. About 30 percent of the funds would be divided based on the extent of damage, and another 30 percent would go to creating and carrying out a comprehensive master plan covering the entire Gulf Coast.
The other compromise involved what the money could be spent on. While Senator Landrieu and some state officials wanted the money in Louisiana to be spent on coastal restoration and other environmental projects, officials from other states wanted more leeway.
Alabama officials in particular wanted the freedom to spend money on economic projects like port expansion and road building, rather than exclusively on environmental needs. They argued that the economic damage to Alabama from the BP spill was disproportionate to the state's relatively small coastline.
Senator Landrieu has trumpeted the Restore Act, saying that its funds would reach the coast more quickly than natural resources damage claim money, and that states would have greater control.
''We really need this money now,'' she said on a conference call with reporters on Thursday. ''It is not going to help us to get this money in 20 years.''
She has found agreement among some other gulf state lawmakers, including Representative Bonner, though to a lesser extent with the other senator from Louisiana, David Vitter.
''From a Louisiana point of view, I think it's a trade-off,'' said Senator Vitter, a Republican. ''N.R.D.A. gives us a significantly bigger percentage of the money and Restore gives us fewer federal strings attached. I think there's been a lot of negotiating about how N.R.D.A. would be used. Since it's a significantly greater share of the money, I think our negotiators are trying to push things in that direction.''
Of course, more money does not automatically mean a healthy Gulf of Mexico, said David Uhlmann, a law professor at the University of Michigan and former federal prosecutor of environmental crimes.
''At the end of the day, there's only so much we can do to bring the gulf all the way back to life,'' he said. ''That's a process that, more than anything else, will take time -- and may not ever be entirely successful.''

HEADLINE: Another Fumble By the S.E.C. On Fraud

BYLINE: By JAMES B. STEWART

 BODY:
Edward S. Steffelin was at a dinner with clients in Beijing in June 2011 when he got the call from his lawyer, Alex Lipman. The Securities and Exchange Commission was about to charge Mr. Steffelin with securities fraud, blaming him in part for the financial crisis.
With public anger at Wall Street still at fever pitch, the pressure was enormous on Mr. Steffelin, whose reputation until then was unblemished. JPMorgan Chase, the giant bank responsible for the exotic mortgage security, known as a collateralized debt obligation, or C.D.O., at the center of the case, had already caved in, agreeing to settle and pay $153.6 million.
''Do you really want your client to be the poster child of the JPMorgan C.D.O. fraud?'' an S.E.C. lawyer had told Mr. Lipman, as the lawyer later told the judge in the case.
Mr. Steffelin was angry and incredulous that it had come to this, and his first impulse was to blame his lawyer. He yelled at Mr. Lipman over the phone. 
Mr. Steffelin, who worked for a financial firm that advised JPMorgan on the deal, was formally charged on June 21, 2011. But on Friday, in a rare public about-face, the S.E.C. asked Judge Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum of Federal District Court in New York to dismiss the charges against Mr. Steffelin with prejudice, meaning the case can't be refiled.
Now, if Mr. Steffelin is going to emerge as a ''poster child'' for anything, it will be as a victim of regulatory overreach.
''It's very unusual and unusually embarrassing for the S.E.C.,'' said John C. Coffee Jr., a professor at Columbia Law School and an expert in securities law.
An S.E.C. spokesman, John Nester, said: ''Our duty in all cases is to achieve a just and appropriate outcome. Our decision here appropriately reflects information that came to light as the litigation progressed.''
Coming on the heels of a jury's acquittal of a midlevel Citigroup executive, Brian Stoker, this summer on charges in another mortgage-backed securities deal, the S.E.C.'s campaign to hold someone accountable for the huge losses in mortgages at the heart of the financial crisis is in shambles.
Of the three individual defendants in these cases, only Fabrice Tourre, the self-described Fabulous Fab, who is currently on leave from Goldman Sachs, still faces trial, now scheduled for July 2013.
The failure to go after high-ranking officials at the big banks responsible for the mortgage crisis has been a recurring issue for the government in its pursuit of individual fraud cases.
As the foreman of the jury that acquitted Mr. Stoker this summer told my Times colleague Peter Lattman, ''Stoker structured a deal that his bosses told him to structure, so why didn't they go after the higher-ups rather than a fall guy?''
Professor Coffee pointed out: ''Very few high-ranking individuals at any institution have been charged. Take the Goldman Sachs case. It was strong. But the highest-ranking individual charged was the Fabulous Fab, and he was the equivalent of a trainee sergeant. This is part of a pattern.''
The S.E.C. points to more than a hundred cases related to the financial crisis that have brought in about $2.2 billion in penalties. They include Angelo Mozilo, the co-founder of the mortgage lender Countrywide Financial, who paid $67.5 million to settle S.E.C. fraud charges, and senior officers of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-backed mortgage companies. But otherwise, few if any of the individual defendants would qualify as boldface names.
When I met the square-jawed, 43-year-old Mr. Steffelin, he expressed a mix of relief that he was on the brink of vindication, bewilderment that he was ever singled out for blame and anger that he was subjected to a long, painful and unjust ordeal to satisfy a public lust for someone to hold responsible for the mortgage debacle.
As his lawyer Mr. Lipman told the judge in October 2011, ''This case was about getting on the front page of The Wall Street Journal.''
Mr. Steffelin said he came under intense pressure to settle. But ''I looked at this, and realized that if I settled, this would be with me for the rest of my life. It would effectively end my career,'' he said. More important, he was steadfast in his belief that he hadn't committed a fraud, acted negligently or done anything else wrong.
''I kept saying there was nothing there, and I kept thinking the S.E.C. would realize that, and the case would go away, but it didn't,'' he told me.
''It was horrible. My name was in the papers. My picture was in The Wall Street Journal next to Angelo Mozilo. Every time you Google my name, you see the charges. My mother was so upset. Professionally, you say you're innocent, and no one believes you. The worst part is you don't even know how much damage it's done, because no one tells you the bad things. So you never know.''
Still, it could have been worse. Mr. Steffelin said his current employer stood behind him and that his former firm's insurer, A.I.G., was paying his legal fees, which now amount to more than $3 million.
How did Mr. Steffelin get singled out in the first place? A high school athlete in Colorado and standout student at Occidental College and Dartmouth's Tuck School of Business, Mr. Steffelin worked at a unit of a now-defunct investment firm, GSC Capital Corporation, that, among other things, acted as a collateral manager on complex mortgage deals. It helped assemble and evaluate mortgage-backed securities and derivatives that were assembled into packages by banks like JPMorgan and then marketed to yield-hungry investors at the height of the real estate boom.
Mr. Steffelin said the market at the time bordered on ''surreal.'' Credit, he said, ''was unbelievably easy. There was huge demand for C.D.O. securities.''
By the standards of the day, which were admittedly lax, Mr. Steffelin showed at least some concern about the quality of the assets in such deals.
Mr. Steffelin had been asked by Goldman Sachs to serve a similar function in the now-infamous Abacus deal. But he and GSC refused, ''given their negative views on most of the credits Paulson had selected,'' as Mr. Tourre of Goldman put it in an e-mail. He was referring to John Paulson, the billionaire hedge fund manager who helped choose the assets in that deal and then bet against it.
Mr. Steffelin subsequently wrote an e-mail to Peter Ostrem, head of Goldman's C.D.O. origination desk, saying, ''I do not have to say how bad it is that you guys are pushing this thing.''
The relatively low-ranking Mr. Tourre was the only person accused by the S.E.C. of wrongdoing in the Abacus deal. Neither Mr. Paulson nor Mr. Ostrem was charged. Nor was the collateral manager for Abacus.
Goldman itself settled charges that it should have told investors that Mr. Paulson had a hand in selecting the securities that he subsequently bet against, and the firm paid a record $550 million.
At first blush, Mr. Steffelin's case may have looked like Goldman's. The S.E.C. charged that Mr. Steffelin allowed a large investor in mortgage-backed securities, a hedge fund called Magnetar Capital, to help choose the assets in the C.D.O. that JPMorgan structured and marketed. The commission further contended that Magnetar was betting against some of those securities and that Mr. Steffelin should have disclosed this to investors, but did not.
Among the problems with this theory were Mr. Steffelin's claim that Magnetar didn't choose the assets that went into the deal, even if it was aware of some of them (JPMorgan made the final decision); that JPMorgan, not Mr. Steffelin, was responsible for the offering documents and that Mr. Steffelin accurately provided whatever information JPMorgan wanted; and that lawyers for GSC and JPMorgan scrutinized the offering materials and signed off on them, so Mr. Steffelin, who isn't a lawyer, had every reason to believe they passed muster.
While JPMorgan structured and marketed the synthetic collateralized debt obligation at the center of the supposed fraud, no one at the bank was charged with anything, even though it paid $153.6 million to settle charges that it misled investors.
Putting all those arguments aside, the biggest flaw in the S.E.C.'s theory may have been the fact that Magnetar was not betting against the C.D.O. that JPMorgan structured. On the contrary, it bought equity in the deal, which meant that its interests were aligned with other investors.
This is very different from Mr. Paulson's position in the Abacus deal, because he was betting against other investors in Abacus.
The S.E.C. may have been slow to grasp this distinction. It is true that Magnetar bet against some of the individual assets that made up the C.D.O. But in a synthetic C.D.O., every mortgage-based asset in the security represented a bet between two parties -- one betting the asset would rise and the other that it would fall. Those investors had no interest in the performance of the pooled assets in the security.
After Judge Cedarbaum dismissed one of the three counts against Mr. Steffelin in October 2011, ruling that he hadn't engaged in ''fraud or deceit,'' and seemed to cast doubt on the strength of the S.E.C.'s case, the S.E.C. approached Mr. Steffelin's lawyer, Mr. Lipman, a partner at Nixon Peabody in New York and former assistant United States attorney.
Mr. Lipman repeatedly urged the commission to ''do the right thing'' and dismiss the charges, even though a dismissal with prejudice -- as opposed to a settlement, in which the S.E.C. gains at least some injunctive relief -- is extremely rare.
Months and hours of negotiations ensued. But finally in late May, Mr. Lipman got a call from the S.E.C. and relayed the news to Mr. Steffelin that the head of the enforcement division, Robert S. Khuzami, had agreed to ask the commission to drop the case.
''I was very surprised by the call,'' Mr. Lipman told me. ''It took tremendous courage for them to reverse course and do the right thing, and they deserve credit for that.''
The S.E.C. said such decisions take months of deliberations at many levels, but it may not be coincidence that it took until this week, after the elections, for the S.E.C. to move to dismiss the charges.
With the commission already at two strikes in its most prominent mortgage fraud cases, ''it seems unable to either bring or prove a case,'' Professor Coffee said. ''The institutions can't be guilty without someone making a culpable decision, but the S.E.C. seems to be emulating Inspector Clouseau and is constantly losing the trail.''

HEADLINE: An Economic Prescription: Growth Before Austerity

 BODY:
To the Editor:
As co-chairs of the Bipartisan Policy Center's Debt Reduction Task Force, we suspect that we fall into the category of those whom Paul Krugman considers ''deficit scolds'' (''Hawks and Hypocrites,'' column, Nov. 12). 
Our recommendations are threefold:
Economic growth must precede full-scale debt restraint.
Congress should take action now to pass legislation phasing in tax reform that yields new revenues and restructuring entitlements to curb the continued growth of federal spending, particularly for health care.
We cannot resort to such ham-handed mechanisms as the approaching sequester cuts, large across-the-board tax increases and other elements of the ''fiscal cliff.''
Most serious analysts concur with this three-piece approach.
As you have reported, in late 2010, our 19-member task force recommended a holiday from the full 12.4 percent Social Security payroll tax, not the partial 2 percent cut that Congress ultimately passed. We believed, and still do, that whether it comes in the form of a payroll tax holiday, an income tax rebate or another similar mechanism, the most pressing priority is to get the economy out of ''stall speed.''
We have also suggested a possible ''framework'' for the lame-duck Congress to pass a modest down payment on deficit reduction in December, while pursuing a comprehensive agreement -- a ''grand bargain'' of sorts -- in 2013.
Growth before austerity is our recommendation. Mr. Krugman, not all deficit scolds are alike.

HEADLINE: Whether 'Fiscal Cliff' or Debtpocalypse, by Any Name, It Spells Austerity

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Come January, the United States might careen off the fiscal cliff. Or start rolling down the fiscal slope. Or, in a worst-case scenario, find itself staggering amid the hot ashes of a debtpocalypse.
One thing is certain. Absent Congressional action, the country faces more than half a trillion dollars in tax increases and spending cuts next year. Workers would have less take-home pay. Financial markets might panic. Eventually, the country could fall back into a recession.
Many politicians and pundits in Washington are terrified of it, and President Obama and Congressional leaders met Friday to publicly kick off a series of negotiations to avoid it. But that does not mean that anyone can quite agree on what to call it. 
Indeed, in Washington, vigorous semantic debate has sprung up alongside the heated policy debate. And a thousand tortured metaphors have bloomed.
The left-of-center Economic Policy Institute here has termed it the ''fiscal obstacle course.'' The commentator Derek Thompson at The Atlantic has described it as weights in a runner's backpack.
BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, has poetically advised that getting past the cliff may result in a sky dive, a bungee jump or a hard stop. The conservative economist Glenn Hubbard, the dean of the business school at Columbia University, likened it to a rocky shore where he used to summer in Maine.
The MSNBC commentator Chris Hayes got angry, taking to Twitter to complain ''#itsnotacliff #itsnotacliff #itsnotacliff.'' Peter Suderman of the libertarian magazine Reason got silly, ruminating, ''Fiscal Clifford the Big Red Dog.'' The Columbia Journalism Review got defeatist, calling it the ''fiscal whatchamacallit.''
It is worrying Washington, and evidently driving its pundits mad. But what is wrong with the plain old name ''fiscal cliff''? And where did it come from, anyway?
Early this year, staff members on Capitol Hill became concerned about the immensely overstuffed slate of issues facing the lame-duck Congress, including the expiration of the Bush-era tax cuts and a patch to prevent millions of families from the alternative minimum tax. There is also the Medicare ''doc fix,'' which blocks cuts to doctor reimbursement rates; extending emergency benefits for the long-term unemployed; the mandatory across-the-board spending cuts set for Jan. 1; and the country's hitting the debt ceiling.
Worse, all those things would happen nearly at once. Staff members termed it the ''debtpocalypse,'' or ''debtmageddon.''
But the drier ''fiscal cliff'' has become the common nomenclature, popularized by no less an authority than Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve. At the end of February, in testimony to Congress, Mr. Bernanke warned that under current law, ''there's going to be a massive fiscal cliff of large spending cuts and tax increases'' in 2013.
''I hope that Congress will look at that and figure out ways to achieve the same long-run fiscal improvement without having it all happen at one date,'' he added.
The name stuck. But the term does not quite capture the particular brand of economic catastrophe that some say could be coming this winter, leaving analysts and journalists reaching for a more apt metaphor.
For one, the term makes it sound as if the country's debts will explode come January.
''Our national debt increases about $3 million every minute,'' Scott Davis, the chief executive of UPS, said in a statement this month, for instance, urging politicians to avert the cliff. ''Our leadership needs to adapt to the economic realities, take a disciplined approach, and most importantly, ACT.''
But failure to avoid the automatic tax increases and spending cuts would give the United States an austerity crisis, not a debt crisis. Indeed, the simplest way for Washington to tackle its deficits and debts would be to do absolutely nothing.
Were that to happen, all kinds of changes that legislators normally try to avoid -- including but not limited to raising taxes on the poor, cutting pay for doctors and slashing the defense budget -- would happen automatically. According to an analysis by the Congressional Budget Office, the country's deficit would fall to about 1 percent of economic output in the fiscal year 2015 from more than 7 percent in the fiscal year 2012.
But an economy growing at a tepid 2 percent annual rate could not stomach such large tax increases and spending cuts without eventually falling into a recession, economists predict. The austerity budget would sting hard.
That leads to the second problem with the cliff metaphor. It makes it sound as if falling off it implies a certain grisly death -- or, in economic terms, a recession. But analysts say that is not quite right.
Chad Stone of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, for instance, has argued that the cliff is more of a slope. Its powerful effects would be felt gradually and cumulatively, not immediately. You would slide down, not fall off. Moreover, Congress could undo much of the damage. Meaning even if you slid down, you could climb back up.
Moreover, the ''cliff'' is in fact no monolith, instead composed of dozens of separate policy changes with different potentials to disrupt the economy-- hence the Economic Policy Institute's decision to call it an ''obstacle course.''
Whatever it is called, analysts agree that it would hardly be pretty, to torture the metaphor once more.

HEADLINE: Myanmar's Rush to Democracy Leaves Its Poor Behind

BYLINE: By THOMAS FULLER

 BODY:
YANGON, Myanmar -- The center of Yangon is filled with signs that capitalism is on the march in this former socialist military dictatorship. Coca-Cola and Pepsi compete on billboards, a car dealership seems to open every week, and hawkers sell copies of the new Foreign Investment Law to motorists stuck in traffic -- the clogged streets a perverse but potent symbol of the country's transformation.
But 45 minutes away, on the outskirts of the city, is a different Myanmar. Children splash in filthy puddles along deeply rutted roads, and day laborers sleep away the afternoon in rickety wooden shacks awaiting jobs that come too rarely. 
''Things have been the same here for 20 years,'' Daw Thein Yi, 53, said as she watched over her grandchild while slapping wet laundry against a stone.
Residents of the sprawling suburban slum, known as New Dagon Township South, have little of the hope and expectation voiced in central Yangon about the democratic changes that have helped open up one of the world's most reclusive countries and helped inspire a visit by President Obama on Monday -- the first by an American president.
U Sein Maung, a 50-year-old day laborer and father of four, squinted in puzzlement when asked about the pending visit. ''We didn't hear he was coming,'' he said.
Twenty months of sometimes breathtaking economic and political changes in Myanmar under the civilian government of President Thein Sein have touched only a sliver of the country's 55 million people, those tracking the process of change say.
''Most of the changes have happened in the upper parts of society,'' said U Yan Myo Thein, a former political prisoner who frequently writes commentaries for Myanmar's news media.
It may be too soon to expect broad portions of the country's impoverished population to benefit from overtures to the world and its businesses. But some in Myanmar are concerned that the failure to reach the indigent majority points to wider problems with an overhaul program trying to free the country from the legacy of its military and socialist era.
''The government has not yet succeeded in unleashing the market,'' said U Phone Win, director of a law firm, Maw Htoon & Partners, that advises foreign companies looking to invest in the country.
Mr. Phone Win says small businesses remain frustrated by thickets of restrictions and the hierarchical habits of government employees used to working for military leaders. Even something as basic as opening a restaurant, shop or boutique hotel can be blocked by bureaucrats accustomed to waiting for superiors' orders.
At the high end, Mr. Phone Win says, he has hosted a parade of foreigners looking to invest in the country. Many leave unfulfilled. ''Billionaires are coming here on their private planes, but no one can make deals,'' he said.
The common refrain among foreign investors these days is ''wait and see.''
Before elections in 2010, Myanmar was both one of the most brutal dictatorships in Asia and a closed, command economy where government factories churned out a variety of items like soap and bicycles.
Since then, Mr. Thein Sein, a former general, has moved the country rapidly away from its dictatorial past, hoping to revive an economy eroded by decades of inept leadership and corruption. Those changes, including freeing political prisoners and allowing multiparty elections, have earned cautious accolades and led the United States and others to ease sanctions meant to cripple the junta. (On Friday, the United States followed through on earlier promises, saying it would allow most goods from Myanmar, also known as Burma, to be imported for the first time in almost a decade.)
Easing the various sanctions opened the country to a flood of curious would-be investors hungry for the country's natural resources and eager to sell to a population that had little in the way of modern conveniences like cars and cellphones.
Stephen Groff, vice president of the Asian Development Bank, the Manila-based institution that re-engaged with Myanmar this year after a 25-year absence, compared the economic changes here to the liberalization of Vietnam's economy, which began allowing free enterprise in the late 1980s. In both countries, changes came from within the leadership and thus were much more gradual than the convulsive uprisings seen, for example, during the Arab Spring.
The streets of Yangon today testify to that relative stability. Residents say violent crime remains rare in central Yangon, despite ample opportunities for theft. Because credit cards have been introduced only in recent months and banks remain dysfunctional, residents carry around large amounts of cash. Secretaries and office workers use rice sacks to haul stacks of money for their businesses.
But continuity and stability also mean that the same government workers who served under the highly repressive junta are now responsible for breaking down the system they helped build.
''The legal and regulatory environment and the financial system remain very, very weak and underdeveloped,'' Mr. Groff said.
Advisers to the government who are helping introduce new policies say changes coming from Mr. Thein Sein's office are being bogged down at lower levels in the government.
''The international community expects too much -- they need to lower their expectations,'' said U Tin Maung Than, director of the Myanmar Development Resource Institute, a research organization with close ties to the president's office. ''And the people need to lower their expectations, too.''
For Mr. Sein Maung, the day laborer, expectations could not be much lower.
He has no refrigerator, television or anything that runs on electricity, save a single neon bulb that hangs from the ceiling. His wife and four children sleep on the uneven planks of the shack he built from scratch.
As he answered questions from a reporter -- a rare outside visitor to the slum -- he held his 4-month-old boy. What will become of his son in the new Myanmar?
''He will never be rich,'' Mr. Sein Maung said matter-of-factly. ''There's no way for people like us to get rich. We just hope he gets an education.''

HEADLINE: Obama Meeting Top Lawmakers in Tough Deficit Talks

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
Democratic and Republican leaders of Congress emerged from their first budget meeting with President Obama at the White House at midday Friday and, in a rare show of bipartisan bonhomie, jointly expressed confidence that the two parties will reach an agreement before the end of the year to avert economy-rattling tax increases and across-the-board spending cuts.
The four leaders -- two Republicans, John A. Boehner, the House speaker, and Mitch McConnell, the Senate minority leader; and two Democrats, Harry Reid, the Senate majority leader, and Nancy Pelosi, the House minority leader -- politely took turns at a microphone outside the West Wing, addressing each other by first names and describing the 70-minute session as constructive.
''We feel very comfortable with each other, and this isn't something we're going to wait until the last day of December to get it done,'' Mr. Reid said. 
''This isn't the first time that we've dealt with these issues,'' he said. ''We feel we understand what the problem is. And we felt very -- I feel very good about what we were able to talk about in there. We have the cornerstones of being able to work something out. We're both going to have to give up some of the things that we know are a problem.''
Mr. Boehner said he outlined a framework for overhauling the tax code and spending programs that is ''consistent with the president's call for a fair and balanced approach.''
''To show our seriousness,'' he added, ''we put revenue on the table as long as it's accompanied by significant spending cuts.''
His Senate counterpart, Mr. McConnell, made plain that Republicans were talking about spending for the entitlement programs, chiefly Medicare and Medicaid, which are growing fast as the population ages and, along with military spending, are squeezing everything else in the federal budget. Republican senators, Mr. McConnell said, ''fully understand that you can't save the country until you have entitlement programs that fit the demographics of the changing America in the coming years.''
''We're prepared to put revenues on the table,'' he added, ''provided we fix the real problem, even though most of my members, I think without exception, believe that we're in the dilemma we're in not because we tax too little but because we spend too much.''
Ms. Pelosi, whose House Democratic colleagues include many liberals who resist significant changes to entitlement spending, said: ''We understand our responsibility here. We understand that it has to be about cuts, it has to be about revenue, it has to be about growth, it has to be about the future.'' She added, ''I feel confident that a solution may be in sight.''
With Mr. Obama in the Roosevelt Room, the leaders made up the same cast who bitterly fought in 2011, then eventually agreed to nearly $1 trillion in spending cuts over 10 years but deadlocked on the roughly $4 trillion ''grand bargain'' both sides say the country needs.
Mr. Obama demands that it include up to $1.6 trillion in tax increases for the wealthy, while Republicans favor less in revenue but big cost-saving changes to Medicare and Medicaid.
The talks began on a friendly note, as well: With reporters and cameras briefly allowed into the room, the president wished a happy birthday to Mr. Boehner, who turns 63 on Saturday.
The two sides met after a tense week of postelection, pre-bargaining positioning. Mr. Obama, after making an issue of it in his re-election campaign, claims a mandate to insist on extending the Bush-era tax cuts, which otherwise expire on Dec. 31 -- but not for income of $250,000 and above for couples and $200,000 for individuals.
More broadly, the outcome of the budget talks will go a long way toward defining his leverage for a second term, both in terms of his influence and the resources available to him to press his agenda.
The president ''will not sign, under any circumstances, an extension of tax cuts for the top 2 percent of American earners,'' his spokesman, Jay Carney, told reporters on Thursday.
''We have to make sure that taxes don't go up on the middle class, that the economy remains strong,'' Mr. Obama said as the meeting began.
''That's an agenda that Democrats and Republicans and independents, people all across the country share,'' he said. ''So our challenge is to make sure that we are able to cooperate together work together find some common ground, make some tough compromises, build some consensus to do the people's business.''
''My hope is, is that this is going to be the beginning of a fruitful process where we're able to come to an agreement that will reduce our deficit in a balanced way, that we will deal with some of these long-term impediments to growth,'' he added.
Republican leaders, for their part, have signaled since their losses for the White House and in Congress that they would agree to additional tax revenues, but they oppose raising the top marginal rate, which is now 35 percent and scheduled to return to 39.6 percent, the Clinton-era level, on Jan. 1.
And Republicans are holding out for significant future savings from Medicare and Medicaid, which Mr. Obama and his party also support as necessary to controlling the mounting federal debt in an aging population -- to a limit. Still, many liberal Democrats are mobilizing against entitlement program cuts, especially after a campaign in which Republicans and their standard-bearer, Mitt Romney, attacked Mr. Obama and the Democrats for having enacted Medicare reductions as part of the 2010 health-care law.
All four Congressional leaders will remain in their senior posts, both for the lame-duck session that started this week and the new Congress that starts in January. The lame-duck session could last through the holidays unless the parties can reach an agreement on a budget deal to avoid a so-called fiscal cliff after Jan. 1, when the country would be hit by more than $500 billion in tax increases -- mainly from the expiration of the Bush tax rates -- and across-the-board cuts in military and domestic spending absent a bipartisan compromise on an alternative package of deficit-reduction.
Such large and sudden action could cause a short recession, the Congressional Budget Office has warned; any negotiated alternative would spread the budget cuts over a longer period to avoid harming the still-weak economy.
Mr. Obama, in a news conference on Wednesday, alternately sounded conciliatory and uncompromising as he ratcheted up the pressure on Republicans to immediately agree to extend the Bush-era tax cuts for 98 percent of Americans.
He announced the meeting a week ago, in his first post-election public statement, saying last Friday, ''The American people voted for action, not politics as usual. You elected us to focus on your jobs, not ours.''
He acknowledged then, and since, that both parties would have to make changes to bring down the growing long-term costs of the government health programs. ''But,'' he added, ''as I've said before, we can't just cut our way to prosperity. If we're serious about reducing the deficit, we have to combine spending cuts with revenue -- and that means asking the wealthiest Americans to pay a little more in taxes.''
Mr. Reid said the parties would work over the Thanksgiving holiday and meet again the following week. Mr. Obama leaves on Saturday for a four-day diplomatic trip to Asia.
Ms. Pelosi said afterwards that it is important to set deadlines and show signs of progress in the next few weeks in order to instill ''confidence'' in consumers and financial markets.
Mr. Obama's activities since the election week have signaled his intent -- not just for now but for the second term -- to use his bully pulpit and to keep lines open to outside constituent groups and the public even as he works with leaders of Congress on the insiders' game of negotiating the minutiae of legislation. After Thanksgiving, he occasionally will campaign around the country for his position.
The session with Congressional leaders followed his meetings earlier this week with leaders of unions, progressive groups and corporate executives. Later on Friday Mr. Obama will meet with more than a dozen representatives of civic, civil-rights, disability and anti-poverty groups and organizations representing both older and young Americans.
Participants will include Benjamin Todd Jealous, president of the N.A.A.C.P.; civil rights activist and MSNBC talk-show host Al Sharpton; Chad Griffin, president of the Human Rights Campaign, and A. Barry Rand, head of AARP, the lobby group for older Americans. Also invited is Sister Simone Campbell, who led the ''Nuns on the Bus'' tour for social justice this summer and spoke at the Democratic National Convention, where she decried Republican budget plans as ''immoral.''

HEADLINE: House Passes Russia Trade Bill With Eye on Rights Abuses

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS; David M. Herszenhorn contributed reporting from Moscow.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The House of Representatives voted on Friday to take a step toward normalizing trade relations with Russia, sweeping away one of the last vestiges of cold-war-era policy.
The final tally was 365 to 43, an unusually large majority for a body that seldom agrees to do anything in a bipartisan fashion.
For now at least, Russia remains on a list of former Communist nations that were denied favored trade status in 1974 because they refused to allow their citizens to leave freely. 
But that is likely to change once the Senate takes up the bill. Congressional officials say they expect it to pass there after some unresolved issues are ironed out.
A major factor in the legislation's swift approval -- and one that has opened up a rift with the Russian government -- was that while the House extended one hand, it slapped President Vladimir V. Putin and his administration with the other.
Attached to the trade legislation is a provision that seeks to punish Russians who are implicated in human rights abuses. Inspired by the case of Sergei L. Magnitsky, a Russian lawyer who was tortured and died in prison after he investigated government corruption, the bill would allow the United States to deny visas to Russian officials who are deemed abusers and to freeze their assets.
The Russian Foreign Ministry reacted swiftly and angrily on Friday to the House vote, calling it ''a flagrantly unfriendly and provocative step,'' and pledged to retaliate.
''There should be no illusions,'' the ministry added. ''Responsive measures will follow from our side, and the responsibility for them will lie fully on the U.S.''
The legislation threatens to further strain President Obama's relationship with Mr. Putin, despite hopes for renewed cooperation and conciliation in Mr. Obama's second term.
William F. Browder, a prominent investor who employed Mr. Magnitsky in Russia before his death in 2009 and who fought to get the bill passed, said the House's action would send a strong signal to Mr. Putin and his administration.
''They may be able to act with impunity at home, but they won't be able to act with impunity elsewhere,'' Mr. Browder said.
As the House debated the bill on Friday, Republicans and Democrats alike sounded at once diplomatic and stern, speaking of a growing trade relationship with one of the world's largest economies as they condemned its abuse of its citizens.
Some experts estimate that the eased trade restrictions could double the amount of American exports flowing to Russia to $19 billion in five years.
''With this vote, we look to the future,'' said Representative Gregory Meeks, Democrat of New York.
Representative Wally Herger, Republican of California, said: ''This legislation is not a handout or a gift to Russia. A vote against this bill is a vote against U.S. employers. It's a vote against small businesses.''
Indeed, some real-world economic shifts were behind Friday's vote. Russia joined the World Trade Organization in August, becoming one of the last global economic powerhouses to do so. Without normal trade status, American companies like Boeing and John Deere will not be able to take advantage of reduced trade barriers.
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce called for swift action in the Senate. ''This is a jobs bill that won't cost the taxpayer a penny, and we urge the Senate to approve it as soon as possible,'' the organization's president, Thomas J. Donohue, said.
One hurdle that remains is reconciling the House and Senate bills. While the House legislation applies only to human rights violators from Russia, the Senate version would apply globally.
Earlier this week, Senator Benjamin Cardin, Democrat of Maryland, testified that the House bill should be expanded. ''I need not tell you that human rights violations are not just in Russia,'' he said.

HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times and a wrap-up of the president's weekly address, plus a look at the latest happenings in Washington. 

 BODY:
 Today's Times 
 Budget negotiations reopened in Washington with bipartisan bonhomie as President Obama met with Congressional leaders. Jackie Calmes and Jonathan Weisman report that both sides expressed confidencethat they could reach an agreement before the end of the year to protect the economy from tax increases and sharp cuts in federal spending. 
 Fiscal slope? Fiscal obstacle course? "Fiscal Clifford the Big Red Dog"? The only thing more heated than the policy debate over the series of automatic tax increases and spending cuts scheduled for Jan. 1 is the vigorous semantic debate over what to call it, Annie Lowrey writes.
 Georgia, Ohio and Wisconsin have joined more than a dozen states in decliningto establish the health insurance exchanges - online markets where consumers can shop for subsidized private insurance - at the center of President Obama's health care law, Robert Pear and Abby Goodnough report.
 The more interesting political divide in the country may not be in Washington, but in the states, where the growing ranks of Republican governorshave to decide the fate of many of President Obama's policies, Michael Cooper writes.
 The Obama administration is increasingly concerned about the escalating violence in Gaza, compounded by uncertainties in the relationship with Egypt's current leadership, Helene Cooper writes.
 The testimony of David H. Petraeus before the House and Senate Intelligence Committee focused on statements made by Ambassador Susan E. Rice about the Libya attack, not the extramarital affair that toppled his career, Eric Schmitt reports.
 Weekly Address 
 President Obama hopes to give the middle class "some good news going into the holiday season," with a tax cut for those who earn less than $250,000 a year. On the heels of a productive meeting with Congressional leaders, Mr. Obama used his weekly address to encourage lawmakers to choose a path that would prevent a tax increase "on the first $250,000 of anyone's income. That means all Americans - including the wealthiest Americans - get a tax cut." He asked them not to worry about politics, and instead just get the job done.
 Happenings in Washington 
 President Obama will leave Saturday morning for Bangkok, Thailand, on a trip that will also include an international economic summit in Cambodia and a historic visit to Myanmar.
 The American Red Cross, the Girl and Boy Scouts and local military families will link up for an event at the Red Cross National Headquarters this Saturday. The project: handmade holiday greeting cards for members of the military.

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Better here, worse there. 

 BODY:
Deadline pressure, so not much blogging this weekend. But pursuing the theme that America is doing theleast worst among major economies, here's a chart I find illuminating: 
In the early stages of the crisis, unemployment rose more rapidly in the US than in Europe. This mainly reflected differences in institutions: it's much easier to fire people in America. From some point in 2010 onward, however, the US situation has gradually improved; initially some of the drop in unemployment was basically people leaving the labor force, but more recently there have been solid though modest gains in the ratio of employment to the relevant population (you have to adjust for aging).
Meanwhile, Europe has gotten much worse; now formally in recession, but the truth is that it has been going downhill all along.
Why the divergence? The obvious answer is that the austerity stuff broke out in 2010, and the austerians took over policy much more completely in Europe than in the United States.

HEADLINE: Is the Economic Crisis Making Europe Fat?

BYLINE: SCOTT JOHNSON


HIGHLIGHT: From England to France to Portugal, fruit and vegetable consumption is declining, even as prices continue to rise, and households across Europe are starting to make more food choices based less on quality and more on price. 

 BODY:
The eurozone fell back into recession, it was officially announced on Thursday, prompting renewed concerns about the economic health of the Continent. But amid the flurry of questions over sovereign debt, banking oversight and fiscal responsibility, another kind of austerity is taking hold in European households - the nutritional kind. 
From Britain to France to Portugal, fruit and vegetable consumption is declining, even as prices continue to rise, and households across Europe are starting to make more food choices based less on quality and more on price. 
Fiscal austerity's figurative belt-tightening is causing concern about the actual physical health of Europeans. A report by the European Medical Institute of Obesity found a link among Spanish women between unemployment, "emotional eating" and an increase in obesity. "In general, women are more prone to suffer from depression and anxiety, and the current crisis situation, which - for many - has led to a loss of income and resources, is greatly affecting how and what they are eating," nutrition expert Elisabeth Gonzalez told Spanish news agency EFE.
Obesity has been on the rise in Europe for about two decades, but the pace appears to be picking up in tandem with the economic crisis, as job-seekers retreat into bad habits to ease their anxiety. Over half of Europeans are considered overweight now, and roughly 17 percent are considered obese.
In Italy, where the recession is a year-old, Italians are recycling leftover food like pasta, bread and vegetables into new dishedto make ends meet. One in three Italian households has cut food spending, both in terms of quantity and/or quality, opting for processed food instead of fresh fruits and vegetables. And in Greece, the most crisis-affected of European nations, the government last month asked retailers to discount non-perishable food items that have passed their sell-by dates. 
A recent report by Safefood found that ten percent of people in Ireland were too poor to afford a regular balanced diet, a situation that is bound to worsen in the recession. "The unemployed, low-paid workers, people who are ill, disabled or poorly educated, families with more than three children and lone parents are most at risk," reported the Irish Examiner last month. 
Across Portugal, supermarkets and hypermarkets, with their inexpensive packaged goods and bulk items, continued to gain ground. "Portuguese consumers became more price conscious and prioritized value for money over value-added references in the short term," said one report from Euro Monitor.
Europe is discovering what many in the United States have known for a long time: when times are tough one of the first things to go out the window is health and nutrition. Low-income Americans know this better than most, which helps account for the disproportionate levels of obesity among the poor in the United States, many of whom make McDonald's and other fast food chains a staple of their diet. 
In difficult economic times, experts say governments should do more to ensure that health care - in particular, preventative care that focuses on things like nutrition, diet and exercise - be maintained and even strengthened. That's according to research recently published in the respected medical journal The Lancet. 
Instead, the opposite is happening. 
According to an Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development report published earlier this month, health care spending fell across Europe in 2010, the last year for which figures were publicly available, as countries cut spending. This is in marked contrast to spending levels seen before the crisis hit. From 2000 to 2009, per capita health spending across Europe increased annually at an average of 4.6 percent of GDP, while in 2010 it dropped by 0.6 percent of GDP.
Louisa Bojesen, the co-anchor of CNBC's European Closing Bell, recently pondered whether it made more financial sense to invest in obesity-related stocks or broader European equities:
If I were forced to invest all my money in the current climate, would I feel more confident about investing in the obesity trend - exposure to insulin makers, hip and knee replacement equipment, food trends, fitness and so on, or investing in European equity markets? I decided that the answer would have to be the obesity trend. Do I feel confident that more people will fall into the obese category and live unhealthier lives over the next decade? Yes. Do I think that the European equity market recovery will continue? I have absolutely no idea.
As obesity worsens due to rising food prices and poor food choices, and interest in country-wide and eurozone-wide regulations that help keep people healthy decrease, there's likely to be an increase in Europe of chronic diseases like diabetes, heart disease, asthma, arthritis and cancer. 
"If the report does not yet show any worsening health outcomes due to the crisis," said Yves Leterme, the OECD's secretary general, "there is no cause for complacency - it takes time for poor social conditions or poor quality care to take its toll from people's health."
So European leaders have more than just the region's economic health to worry about.

HEADLINE: Hard Times Could Create a Tech Boom

BYLINE: QUENTIN HARDY


HIGHLIGHT: Cheer up. The bad news from Europe, the bad news from Dell and the modest forecasts for tech industry growth may also be a preamble to a tech-led economic revival. 

 BODY:
Technology isn't letting a good crisis go to waste.
The crisis is global economic uncertainty, which several tech companies and analysts say is crimping spending by corporations. That enterprise spending still represents most of the tech industry. If the corporate restraint gets too severe, it can cause a recession not just in tech, but in the global economy.
It could be the kind of recession that brings hard times to tech, but also forces important changes to how business gets done. Historically, that is the kind of pain that also means renewal, and long-term economic growth. 
Signs of the pain are abundant. On Thursday, the European Union confirmed that Europe was still in recession and indicated things could get worse. Dell reported that third-quarter revenue fell 11 percent, and net income slipped 47 percent, as businesses, governments and consumers walked away from Dell's traditional business of personal computers, laptops and servers. Europe was the worst-hit region, but nowhere looked good. On Tuesday, John Chambers, Cisco Systems' chief executive, said during his first-quarter earnings call that nervous companies were holding cash, wary of spending because of both Europe and a possible budget crisis in the United States.
The research firm Gartner, meanwhile, projected that worldwide enterprise spending on information technology, or I.T., would amount to $2.679 trillion in 2013. While that is a 2.5 percent increase from what Gartner thinks companies will spend in 2012, the increases were largely concentrated in finance and media, and were contingent on both Europe and the United States avoiding fiscal crises.
So where is the good news in all this? Gartner also said that "most enterprises have already significantly cut discretionary I.T. spending growth over the past several years." Barring an economic apocalypse, the firm said in a statement accompanying the study, "they have little room to reduce I.T. spending further over the long run."
In addition, what happens in finance and media often affects other industries. Finance buys things while they are still expensive and cutting-edge, and the rest of us get it later, once the prices come down. Media, which shapes communication and perception, sets a standard for how other companies communicate. Video calling, for example, is becoming commonplace in lots of businesses.
If companies are constrained, but have no choice but to invest, that makes it likely that they will increasingly choose to go through the hard work of adapting their internal systems to accommodate new kinds of technology. It is hard to get people to change behavior, even when there are economic incentives. Often it has to be economic necessity that forces change.
It was, notably, the recession of the early 1980s that forced companies and individuals looking to start their own businesses to adopt PCs. The downturn in the early 1990s led to widespread adoption of client-server technologies, which enabled companies to eliminate layers of management.
The move this time is to cloud computing and mobility. Clouds make the management of resources more efficient, and cut down on the number of people needed to make a corporate I.T. system run. Mobility, as most readers are probably aware by now, makes it possible, even expected, to work anywhere. Those are the new productivity builders, and we all have to get used to companies designed around them.
These are already the fast-growing areas of struggling older tech companies. Cisco's old-line switch business, still its largest segment, had a 2 percent drop in revenue on the quarter, while its wireless, data center and video businesses all had double-digit gains.
Dell's stock fell 9 percent Friday morning, after its debacle with PCs, but Dell also turned around and bought a company called Gale Technologies, a specialist in data center management, for an undisclosed sum.
Even if Dell and Cisco cannot move fast enough to make up for declines in their core businesses, others will benefit. The next big changes in business are already here.
A previous version of this post was unclear on the amount of increase the research firm Gartner expects in worldwide enterprise spending on information technology in 2013. The correct amount is 2.5 percent, not 2.5.

HEADLINE: How to Live Without Irony

BYLINE: CHRISTY WAMPOLE


HIGHLIGHT: If life has become an endless series of sarcastic jokes and pop references, a competition to see who can care the least, we've made a collective misstep. 

 BODY:
If irony is the ethos of our age - and it is - then the hipster is our archetype of ironic living.
The hipster haunts every city street and university town. Manifesting a nostalgia for times he never lived himself, this contemporary urban harlequin appropriates outmoded fashions (the mustache, the tiny shorts), mechanisms (fixed-gear bicycles, portable record players) and hobbies (home brewing, playing trombone). He harvests awkwardness and self-consciousness. Before he makes any choice, he has proceeded through several stages of self-scrutiny. The hipster is a scholar of social forms, a student of cool. He studies relentlessly, foraging for what has yet to be found by the mainstream. He is a walking citation; his clothes refer to much more than themselves. He tries to negotiate the age-old problem of individuality, not with concepts, but with material things. 
He is an easy target for mockery. However, scoffing at the hipster is only a diluted form of his own affliction. He is merely a symptom and the most extreme manifestation of ironic living. For many Americans born in the 1980s and 1990s - members of Generation Y, or Millennials - particularly middle-class Caucasians, irony is the primary mode with which daily life is dealt. One need only dwell in public space, virtual or concrete, to see how pervasive this phenomenon has become. Advertising, politics, fashion, television: almost every category of contemporary reality exhibits this will to irony.

Take, for example, an ad that calls itself an ad, makes fun of its own format, and attempts to lure its target market to laugh at and with it. It pre-emptively acknowledges its own failure to accomplish anything meaningful. No attack can be set against it, as it has already conquered itself. The ironic frame functions as a shield against criticism. The same goes for ironic living. Irony is the most self-defensive mode, as it allows a person to dodge responsibility for his or her choices, aesthetic and otherwise. To live ironically is to hide in public. It is flagrantly indirect, a form of subterfuge, which means etymologically to "secretly flee" (subter + fuge). Somehow, directness has become unbearable to us.
How did this happen? It stems in part from the belief that this generation has little to offer in terms of culture, that everything has already been done, or that serious commitment to any belief will eventually be subsumed by an opposing belief, rendering the first laughable at best and contemptible at worst. This kind of defensive living works as a pre-emptive surrender and takes the form of reaction rather than action.
Life in the Internet age has undoubtedly helped a certain ironic sensibility to flourish. An ethos can be disseminated quickly and widely through this medium. Our incapacity to deal with the things at hand is evident in our use of, and increasing reliance on, digital technology. Prioritizing what is remote over what is immediate, the virtual over the actual, we are absorbed in the public and private sphere by the little devices that take us elsewhere.
Furthermore, the nostalgia cycles have become so short that we even try to inject the present moment with sentimentality, for example, by using certain digital filters to "pre-wash" photos with an aura of historicity. Nostalgia needs time. One cannot accelerate meaningful remembrance.
While we have gained some skill sets (multitasking, technological savvy), other skills have suffered: the art of conversation, the art of looking at people, the art of being seen, the art of being present. Our conduct is no longer governed by subtlety, finesse, grace and attention, all qualities more esteemed in earlier decades. Inwardness and narcissism now hold sway.
Born in 1977, at the tail end of Generation X, I came of age in the 1990s, a decade that, bracketed neatly by two architectural crumblings - of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the Twin Towers in 2001 - now seems relatively irony-free. The grunge movement was serious in its aesthetics and its attitude, with a combative stance against authority, which the punk movement had also embraced. In my perhaps over-nostalgic memory, feminism reached an unprecedented peak, environmentalist concerns gained widespread attention, questions of race were more openly addressed: all of these stirrings contained within them the same electricity and euphoria touching generations that witness a centennial or millennial changeover.
But Y2K came and went without disaster. We were hopeful throughout the '90s, but hope is such a vulnerable emotion; we needed a self-defense mechanism, for every generation has one. For Gen Xers, it was a kind of diligent apathy. We actively did not care. Our archetype was the slacker who slouched through life in plaid flannel, alone in his room, misunderstood. And when we were bored with not caring, we were vaguely angry and melancholic, eating anti-depressants like they were candy.
FROM this vantage, the ironic clique appears simply too comfortable, too brainlessly compliant. Ironic living is a first-world problem. For the relatively well educated and financially secure, irony functions as a kind of credit card you never have to pay back. In other words, the hipster can frivolously invest in sham social capital without ever paying back one sincere dime. He doesn't own anything he possesses.
Obviously, hipsters (male or female) produce a distinct irritation in me, one that until recently I could not explain. They provoke me, I realized, because they are, despite the distance from which I observe them, an amplified version of me.
I, too, exhibit ironic tendencies. For example, I find it difficult to give sincere gifts. Instead, I often give what in the past would have been accepted only at a White Elephant gift exchange: a kitschy painting from a thrift store, a coffee mug with flashy images of "Texas, the Lone Star State," plastic Mexican wrestler figures. Good for a chuckle in the moment, but worth little in the long term. Something about the responsibility of choosing a personal, meaningful gift for a friend feels too intimate, too momentous. I somehow cannot bear the thought of a friend disliking a gift I'd chosen with sincerity. The simple act of noticing my self-defensive behavior has made me think deeply about how potentially toxic ironic posturing could be.
First, it signals a deep aversion to risk. As a function of fear and pre-emptive shame, ironic living bespeaks cultural numbness, resignation and defeat. If life has become merely a clutter of kitsch objects, an endless series of sarcastic jokes and pop references, a competition to see who can care the least (or, at minimum, a performance of such a competition), it seems we've made a collective misstep. Could this be the cause of our emptiness and existential malaise? Or a symptom?
Throughout history, irony has served useful purposes, like providing a rhetorical outlet for unspoken societal tensions. But our contemporary ironic mode is somehow deeper; it has leaked from the realm of rhetoric into life itself. This ironic ethos can lead to a vacuity and vapidity of the individual and collective psyche. Historically, vacuums eventually have been filled by something - more often than not, a hazardous something. Fundamentalists are never ironists; dictators are never ironists; people who move things in the political landscape, regardless of the sides they choose, are never ironists.
Where can we find other examples of nonironic living? What does it look like? Nonironic models include very young children, elderly people, deeply religious people, people with severe mental or physical disabilities, people who have suffered, and those from economically or politically challenged places where seriousness is the governing state of mind. My friend Robert Pogue Harrison put it this way in a recent conversation: "Wherever the real imposes itself, it tends to dissipate the fogs of irony."
Observe a 4-year-old child going through her daily life. You will not find the slightest bit of irony in her behavior. She has not, so to speak, taken on the veil of irony. She likes what she likes and declares it without dissimulation. She is not particularly conscious of the scrutiny of others. She does not hide behind indirect language. The most pure nonironic models in life, however, are to be found in nature: animals and plants are exempt from irony, which exists only where the human dwells.
What would it take to overcome the cultural pull of irony? Moving away from the ironic involves saying what you mean, meaning what you say and considering seriousness and forthrightness as expressive possibilities, despite the inherent risks. It means undertaking the cultivation of sincerity, humility and self-effacement, and demoting the frivolous and the kitschy on our collective scale of values. It might also consist of an honest self-inventory.
Here is a start: Look around your living space. Do you surround yourself with things you really like or things you like only because they are absurd? Listen to your own speech. Ask yourself: Do I communicate primarily through inside jokes and pop culture references? What percentage of my speech is meaningful? How much hyperbolic language do I use? Do I feign indifference? Look at your clothes. What parts of your wardrobe could be described as costume-like, derivative or reminiscent of some specific style archetype (the secretary, the hobo, the flapper, yourself as a child)? In other words, do your clothes refer to something else or only to themselves? Do you attempt to look intentionally nerdy, awkward or ugly? In other words, is your style an anti-style? The most important question: How would it feel to change yourself quietly, offline, without public display, from within?
Attempts to banish irony have come and gone in past decades. The loosely defined New Sincerity movements in the arts that have sprouted since the 1980s positioned themselves as responses to postmodern cynicism, detachment and meta-referentiality. (New Sincerity has recently been associated with the writing of David Foster Wallace, the films of Wes Anderson and the music of Cat Power.) But these attempts failed to stick, as evidenced by the new age of Deep Irony.
What will future generations make of this rampant sarcasm and unapologetic cultivation of silliness? Will we be satisfied to leave an archive filled with video clips of people doing stupid things? Is an ironic legacy even a legacy at all?
The ironic life is certainly a provisional answer to the problems of too much comfort, too much history and too many choices, but it is my firm conviction that this mode of living is not viable and conceals within it many social and political risks. For such a large segment of the population to forfeit its civic voice through the pattern of negation I've described is to siphon energy from the cultural reserves of the community at large. People may choose to continue hiding behind the ironic mantle, but this choice equals a surrender to commercial and political entities more than happy to act as parents for a self-infantilizing citizenry. So rather than scoffing at the hipster - a favorite hobby, especially of hipsters - determine whether the ashes of irony have settled on you as well. It takes little effort to dust them away.

HEADLINE: Obama's Visit to Myanmar: Validation, or a 'Disgrace'?

BYLINE: MARK MCDONALD


HIGHLIGHT: President Obama is due to arrive Monday in Myanmar as part of the ongoing U.S. pivot toward the Asia-Pacific region. His trip also would seem to endorse the democratic reforms under way in Myanmar, although one exiled Burmese activist calls the visit "a disgrace." 

 BODY:
HONG KONG - As President Barack Obama prepared to make a landmark visit to Myanmar, the president of the country, U Thein Sein, acknowledged that runaway nationalism and religious extremism had caused the deadly communal riots that have wracked the western part of Myanmar.
In two spasms of violence, in June and October, Burmese Buddhists fought Rohingya Muslims using hoes, hatchets and bamboo spears. Methodical arson attacks destroyed more than 100,000 buildings, mostly in Rohingya villages, as 167 people were killed and more than 110,000 were made homeless. 
In remarks to Buddhist and Muslim leaders on Myanmar TV, according to a Reuters report, Mr. Thein Sein said, "There were nationalist and religious extremists who incited and agitated improperly behind the scenes to spread the violence in the region." 
He also blamed "foreign organizations and nations who tried to fuel the flame by circulating false and fabricated news," although he did not identify them. More than 1,000 arrests have been made, he said.
In a letter to the United Nations, Mr. Thein Sein pledged to "address contentious political dimensions, ranging from resettlement of displaced populations to granting of citizenship," perhaps giving a glimmer of hope to the stateless and widely reviled Rohingya minority. 
Mr. Obama was scheduled to arrive Monday in Yangon, the commercial capital and Myanmar's principal city. In the first-ever visit to Myanmar (or Burma, its former name) by a sitting American president, Mr. Obama was due to meet with Mr. Thein Sein and the opposition leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi.
The trip is part of the Obama administration's new emphasis on the Asia-Pacific region - a heftier allocation of military and diplomatic assets to counter a rising and more assertive China, as my colleagues Peter Baker and Jane Perlez report in their article previewing the visit by Mr. Obama. (The president is also making stops in Thailand and Cambodia this week.) 
The visit also puts the U.S. presidential imprimatur on sweeping democratic reforms being made in the long-isolated nation, essentially validating those changes largely initiated by Mr. Thein Sein and wildly applauded by the West. 
But in an e-mailed message to Rendezvous and in a commentary on the Democratic Voice of Burma, Zaw Nay Aung, an exiled activist living in Britain, said "it would be a strategic miscalculation if the Obama administration believes the Burmese regime will become its latest ally in the Asia-Pacific region."
"The regime is populated by a group of military elites who are well-trained xenophobic nationalists," he said. "They strongly believe in maintaining relations with neighboring countries in the region, especially China."
Senior military leaders from the former junta have been absorbed into government ministries, the Parliament and the business elite, and many have profited from a sell-off of state-owned companies. Among them are the generals who refused French and American humanitarian aid in the days after Cyclone Nargis tore into Myanmar in 2008, leveling much of the southern delta and killing more than 130,000 people. 
With aid supplies like high-energy biscuits, tarpaulins and fresh water waiting just offshore in naval vessels, the Burmese generals said no. Why? They feared an armed invasion.
"These guys really believe we are planning an invasion. It's nuts!" Shari Villarosa, then the senior U.S. diplomat in Myanmar, told me in an interview in her office a week after the cyclone hit. 
After two weeks of waiting, the ships withdrew. 
The junta's paranoia and dithering in the weeks after the storm was something of an epiphany for Mr. Thein Sein, the former general who had been titularly in charge of disaster response. He has since been widely acclaimed for shepherding political reforms past the hard-liners in Parliament who despise Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and her democrats.

Mr. Obama's visit, Mr. Zaw Nay Aung said, would be most pleasing to "the ex-generals who have continued ruling the country behind the veneer of reforms." 
"The ruling elites have been waiting for this moment since they came into power nearly two years ago," he said. "The U.S. approval of the country's reform process has been one of the core political objectives that the regime has tried to secure since transitioning into power."
Mr. Zaw Nay Aung, the director of the research group Burma Independence Advocates, said it was "a disgrace for the U.S. president to make such a historic trip to Burma while hundreds of political prisoners still remain in jails" and while ethnic conflicts, communal strife and government land grabs continue.
On Friday, in announcing new relaxations of trade sanctions against Myanmar, the United States said it "remains concerned about corruption, remaining political prisoners, continued military ties to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and ethnic conflict."
The new measures, which now allow the importation of most Myanmar-made goods into the United States, marked "another step in the normalization of our bilateral economic relationship," according to a Treasury Department statement. The trade measures had been requested by the Myanmar leadership and Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi.
The ban on imports of Burmese jade and rubies remains in effect; Treasury added seven new companies to its list of banned firms; and the department reiterated its prohibition against American firms doing business of any sort with companies controlled by Steven Law and Tay Za.
Mr. Law is the son of Lo Hsing Han, whom the Treasury Department has called the "godfather of heroin" and "one of the world's key heroin traffickers dating back to the early 1970s." Mr. Law, the department said, joined his father's drug operations in the 1990s and became "a crony" of the former military regime. 
Tay Za, reputedly the wealthiest man in Myanmar, holds vast teak and other timber concessions through his principal firm, the Htoo Group. He owns Air Bagan, a domestic carrier, and a number of luxury seaside resorts. He is also known to the U.S. government as an arms dealer, and a Treasury circular called him a junta "henchman."

A people-mover based on the small Transit Connect commercial van that has been available since 2009, it shares that vehicle's distinctive high-roof shape and will be offered with either a 120.6-inch wheelbase and three rows of seats or a 104.8-inch wheelbase and two rows of seats.
With three rows of seats, the Transit Connect Wagon can hold seven passengers, just like a minivan. Both second- and third-row seats fold flat, creating an abundance of cargo space behind the front seat, just like a minivan. Sliding doors on both driver and passenger sides of the vehicle, just like those on a minivan, provide easy access to second- and third-row seating and, in combination with a liftgate at the rear, make for easy loading of whatever one might wish to transport. 
"How is it not a minivan?" one of the assembled journalists asked after the presentation.
"It's a smaller package," said Tim Stoehr, Ford's commercial truck marketing manager.
The journalist pointed out that the subcompact Mazda5 is called a minivan.
"They can call it whatever they want," said Mr. Stoehr.
In truth, Mazda avoids the supposedly offensive minivan moniker as well, saying that the "Mazda5 refuses to be categorized." Both automakers perhaps believe that consumers find the M-word so offensive that applying it to a product would be suicidal. They could be right.
While the Transit Connect Wagon is clearly a minivan with a high roof, unlike other seven-passenger minivans available in the United States it is expected to deliver at least 30 m.p.g. on the highway. E.P.A. fuel-economy estimates are not yet available.
Engine choices will include Ford's 1.6 liter EcoBoost turbocharged 4-cylinder and a naturally aspirated 2.5-liter. No engine specs were provided, but in the Ford Fusion the 1.6-liter EcoBoost delivers 178 horsepower, while the 2.5-liter generates 175 horsepower -- with the turbocharged EcoBoost having a stouter torque curve and slightly better fuel economy.
Mike Levine, a Ford spokesman, said the cargo space of the long-wheelbase model with both second- and third-row seats folded was over 100 cubic feet. That makes it only slightly less cargo-capable than the Nissan Quest, which measures 108.4 cubic feet. The maximum cargo area of Chrysler's Town and Country minivan is 143.8 cubic feet.
The Transit Connect provides ample legroom for all passengers, even those in the third row. The third-row seat has 5 inches of adjustment built in, and when slid all the way forward, 19.8 cubic feet of cargo space is available behind the seat.
Several trim levels will be offered, and options will include leather seating surfaces, a touch-screen display, a rear-view camera, the MyFord Touch communication and entertainment system, and a full-glass panoramic roof.
Mr. Stoehr said no production estimates were available, but the mix is expected to be 80 percent long-wheelbase and 20 percent short-wheelbase models. The vehicle will be built in Ford's plant in Valencia, Spain. That plant builds a number of vehicles on Ford's C1 subcompact platform, so according to Mr. Stoehr, production is flexible and the mix can be adjusted to meet demand.
The Transit Connect Wagon is expected to arrive at Ford dealerships in late 2013. No pricing information is available at this time.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: A New Southern Strategy

BYLINE: By KAREN L. COX. 
A professor of history at the University of North Carolina, Charlotte and the author of ''Dreaming of Dixie: How the South Was Created in American Popular Culture.''

 BODY:
Charlotte, N.C.
IT'S tough being a Southern liberal. In the postelection analysis of the past two weeks, pundits have made hay of the fact that while Barack Obama won the election, Mitt Romney won the Confederacy. Or as Jon Stewart put it, ''most of the Confederacy.''
After Mr. Romney carried the lion's share of the region's electoral votes, people were quick to pounce. One person on Twitter wrote, ''I always knew the Zombie Apocalypse would start in the Southern States.'' On Facebook, in a widely shared image comparing the 2012 electoral map with the map of former slave states, the individual who posted it wrote, ''Sometimes change is really hard, especially when people don't want to change.''
That we are still using the term ''Confederacy'' to describe the South and pointing to slave maps says a lot about how hard it is for the region to move beyond its historical reputation, however richly deserved, for one that reflects more current realities. 
Voters in Charlotte, N.C., Atlanta, Nashville, New Orleans, Birmingham, Ala., and even Jackson, Miss., gave Mr. Obama substantial majorities, not because they are out of step with the rest of the country but because they are part of the same urban-rural divide that drives voting everywhere.
So if we're going to apply the term ''Confederacy,'' then perhaps we can all agree that while a majority of Southern white voters seem intransigent to change, the region is nevertheless being transformed by its changing demographics.
Virginia, home to the capital of the Confederacy, went for Mr. Obama. Florida, part of the original Confederacy, also went for Mr. Obama. North Carolina, which Mr. Obama carried in 2008, went to Mr. Romney, but by a very slim margin -- more attributable to the economy and job losses than to any conspiracy of Confederate dunces.
Many people have labeled my home state of North Carolina a red state, but it's much more complicated than that. In the very rural mountain county of Avery, for example, Mr. Romney won with a whopping 74.5 percent of the vote, yet in Mecklenburg County, which includes Charlotte, he lost to Mr. Obama by nearly 23 percentage points. (True, North Carolinians elected a Republican governor, but to be fair, the Democratic candidate ran a weak campaign.)
Similarly, in Fulton County, Georgia, whose county seat is Atlanta, Mr. Obama bested Mr. Romney with about 64 percent of the vote but lost in the state's mostly rural counties. If Charlotte or Atlanta were the size of New York City, then perhaps we wouldn't tag either North Carolina or Georgia as red states.
Even when you break down a clear blue state like New York, you can see this urban-rural dichotomy. In Brooklyn, Mr. Obama carried 81.4 percent of the vote; in the rural county of Hamilton, Mr. Romney won 62.2 percent. The same urban-rural divide can also be found in blue states like California and Washington. In other words, before our liberal allies in blue states point their fingers and scoff, they might want to take a look in their own rural backyards for evidence that their states actually have something in common with the supposedly backward ones in the South.
Yes, Southern voters (especially white ones) cast their lot with Mr. Romney. So, too, did voters in a large section of Western states. What do they have in common? They are states with largely rural populations that tend to be less diverse racially and ethnically, and they tend to vote more for conservative Republicans -- the same trend found in the rural counties of the bluest of states.
THE coalition that voted for Mr. Obama nationally -- single women, minorities and young people -- is the same coalition that voted for the president in Southern states. Latino voters, for example, voted overwhelmingly for Mr. Obama, and they also represent the fastest-growing population within the South. Future elections will be determined by this expanding diversity in the region, much to the chagrin of conservative whites.
It's well known that the Democratic Party of old, commonly referred to as the ''white man's party,'' ruled the South. Today's Southern Democrats reflect the changes that have taken place in the party's platform in the post-World-War-II era. Old-school Southern Democrats, like Strom Thurmond, Jesse Helms and those who followed in their footsteps, bolted to the Republican Party, which adopted a ''Southern strategy'' to win elections by appealing to whites' racism.
As we saw in this election, today's Republican Party has become the bastion of white voters, and not just within the South. There is evidence that ''whiteness'' is not a foolproof strategy in the region, given its changing demography.
While it is true that Republicans dominate the region, there is change in the air. I can see this in my own family. Every summer my brother, who is decidedly Republican, plants a garden in which he grows a variety of peppers -- jalapeos, habaneros and poblanos. He is proud of his garden and shares his harvest with friends who own a Mexican restaurant near his home in Greensboro, N.C.
I doubt that his conversations with the people who work there center on whether they are in this country legally or illegally. So while he may remain a Republican, I believe he recognizes the contributions of Latinos to his community and knows that they do not threaten his success as a white man.
Liberals north and west of me -- people who consider themselves educated and learned -- are the very ones who seem to make the most ill-informed statements (often in a bad attempt at humor) about the region's politics. As someone I follow on Twitter posted: ''I'm liberal. I live in the South. Your jokes are not funny.'' I have no idea to what he was responding, but I can sympathize.
To my chagrin, liberals living outside the South deny our existence, lump us all together by using rhetoric about the Confederacy and heap pity on us with a little condescension thrown in for good measure. They also seem to be unaware of nuance.
The fact is, liberals everywhere live among people who don't share their views. Are you listening Wisconsin, Arizona, Indiana and, yes, New York? Jesse Helms and Strom Thurmond are long dead. Michele Bachmann, Scott Walker and other Tea Party darlings are alive and well, and they aren't all whistling Dixie.
If the Democrats are going to be a true majority party, they will need to build a coalition in all 50 states. So rather than see the South as a lost cause (pun intended), the Democratic Party and liberals north and west of us should put a lid on their regional biases and encourage the change that is possible here.

HEADLINE: Tribe Looks to End Old Exile, but Casino Plans Lead to Conflict

BYLINE: By DAN FROSCH

 BODY:
AKELA FLATS, N.M. -- On a dust-swept strip of Interstate, not far from the Mexican border, sits a small rest stop where weary truckers trickle in day and night, slump down at the handful of tables inside and order a half-pound burger or a cup of coffee.
Unbeknown to many who end up here, they have happened upon the land of the Fort Sill Apache, the newest Indian reservation in the country and, at just 30 acres, the tiniest. 
No tribal members live on the reservation yet. The Fort Sill Apache, who trace their lineage to Geronimo, were driven from New Mexico more than a century ago, and the largest population concentration now resides in Oklahoma. But they still consider this area their ancestral home.
Now, one year after the federal government designated the roadside plot as the tribe's sole reservation, the Fort Sill Apache are mired in a dispute over their efforts to transform the lonesome site into a casino.
The hope, said Jeff Haozous, the tribal chairman, is that a casino will generate enough money to buy additional land and compel some of the 700 enrolled tribal members to come back.
''There is a serious difference between our situation and any other case, in that we're returning to a place from which we've been exiled for over a century,'' Mr. Haozous said as a customer strolled past a wall of photos showing stone-faced Apaches, some draped in traditional garb and others in stiff suits, gazing out on the room.
According to tribal history, the Fort Sill Apache descend primarily from the Warm Springs and Chiricahua Apache bands, who were held as prisoners of war by the United States government in Alabama and Florida before being moved to Fort Sill, Okla.
The tribe bought the New Mexico parcel in 1998 for $30,000, and the land was put in trust for it by the federal government in 2002.
Sitting between Tucson and El Paso on Interstate 10, the rest stop is a natural way station for travelers and has been operating as the Apache Homelands Entertainment Center since 2008.
But casino gambling on Indian lands is a highly competitive and frequently controversial business that can pit tribes against federal and state regulators -- and even one another. Whether the Fort Sill Apache will get approval for a casino is unclear.
The federal Indian Gaming Regulatory Act largely prohibits gambling on lands acquired after Oct. 17, 1988, with certain exceptions. Previous efforts by the tribe to get approval for gambling have failed.
In 2008, believing that the National Indian Gaming Commission, which helps regulate Indian casinos, would ultimately approve their plans, the Fort Sill Apache tried to open a temporary bingo hall here.
But Bill Richardson, the governor at the time, ordered the state police to block access to the building, saying the tribe lacked the authority to operate a casino. The next year, the National Indian Gaming Commission issued a violation to the tribe for running a gambling operation on the site.
Phillip Thompson, the tribe's lawyer, said the Fort Sill Apache had appealed the violation and contend that they should qualify for gambling based on their unique history.
''If they are not allowed to develop anything in Oklahoma or New Mexico, where is their existence?'' he said, adding that the Fort Sill Apache also own a casino in Lawton, Okla., but are prohibited from acquiring additional land there without permission from three other tribes in the area.
This spring, the Fort Sill Apache also filed a gambling application with the Interior Department, which can grant an exception to the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act.
A spokeswoman for the department, Nedra Darling, said it would determine whether gambling is in the tribe's best interest and whether it would be detrimental to the surrounding area. If the application is approved, the department will also seek the support of Gov. Susana Martinez of New Mexico, who could potentially block the casino.
So far, Ms. Martinez has opposed the idea.
''When the land was placed in trust, there was an understanding that the tribe would not take part in gaming,'' Scott Darnell, a spokesman for the governor, said in an e-mail. ''It was a premise of the discussion at the time and was based on representations made by the tribe.''
Reaction in New Mexico's Indian Country, where tribes operate more than a dozen casinos, has been mixed.
The Pojoaque Pueblo wrote a letter to Mr. Haozous expressing support for the Fort Sill Apache's ''economic initiatives.'' That tribe's two casinos are some 300 miles away.
The Mescalero Apache, who operate the Inn of the Mountain Gods Resort and Casino about 150 miles away, the nearest tribal gambling operation in New Mexico, are against the proposal, Mr. Haozous said.
Sandra Platero, vice president of the Mescalero, declined to comment about the issue.
In nearby Deming, some hope that the casino will provide an economic boon to Luna County, which has an unemployment rate of about 12 percent.
''I think it's a good idea,'' said Linda Franklin, Deming's mayor pro tem. ''They have proven they are a tribe. They are from the area. I think we all need to live and work together.''
On Friday, the tribe held a celebration here, commemorating the first anniversary of its reservation proclamation.
Mr. Haozous said he hoped that a decision on the casino would come next year.
''This would be the achievement of a goal that has been held by the Chiricahua people since 1886, when they were removed from the Southwest,'' he said. ''To return home.''

HEADLINE: As Boom Lures App Creators, Tough Part Is Making a Living

BYLINE: By DAVID STREITFELD

 BODY:
ROSEDALE, Md. -- Shawn and Stephanie Grimes spent much of the last two years pursuing their dream of doing research and development for Apple, the world's most successful corporation.
But they did not actually have jobs at Apple. It was freelance work that came with nothing in the way of a regular income, health insurance or retirement plan. Instead, the Grimeses tried to prepare by willingly, even eagerly, throwing overboard just about everything they could.
They sold one of their cars, gave some possessions to relatives and sold others in a yard sale, rented out their six-bedroom house and stayed with family for a while. They even cashed in Mr. Grimes's 401(k).
''We didn't lose any sleep over it,'' said Mr. Grimes, 32. ''I'll retire when I die.'' 
The couple's chosen field is so new it did not even exist a few years ago: writing software applications for mobile devices like the iPhone or iPad. Even as unemployment remained stubbornly high and the economy struggled to emerge from the recession's shadow, the ranks of computer software engineers, including app writers, increased nearly 8 percent in 2010 to more than a million, according to the latest available government data for that category. These software engineers now outnumber farmers and have almost caught up with lawyers.
Much as the Web set off the dot-com boom 15 years ago, apps have inspired a new class of entrepreneurs. These innovators have turned cellphones and tablets into tools for discovering, organizing and controlling the world, spawning a multibillion-dollar industry virtually overnight. The iPhone and iPad have about 700,000 apps, from Instagram to Angry Birds.
Yet with the American economy yielding few good opportunities in recent years, there is debate about how real, and lasting, the rise in app employment might be.
Despite the rumors of hordes of hip programmers starting million-dollar businesses from their kitchen tables, only a small minority of developers actually make a living by creating their own apps, according to surveys and experts. The Grimeses began their venture with high hopes, but their apps, most of them for toddlers, did not come quickly enough or sell fast enough.
And programming is not a skill that just anyone can learn. While people already employed in tech jobs have added app writing to their rsums, the profession offers few options to most unemployed, underemployed and discouraged workers.
One success story is Ethan Nicholas, who earned more than $1 million in 2009 after writing a game for the iPhone. But he says the app writing world has experienced tectonic shifts since then.
''Can someone drop everything and start writing apps? Sure,'' said Mr. Nicholas, 34, who quit his job to write apps after iShoot, an artillery game, became a sensation. ''Can they start writing good apps? Not often, no. I got lucky with iShoot, because back then a decent app could still be successful. But competition is fierce nowadays, and decent isn't good enough.''
The boom in apps comes as economists are debating the changing nature of work, which technology is reshaping at an accelerating speed. The upheaval, in some ways echoing the mechanization of agriculture a century ago, began its latest turbulent phase with the migration of tech manufacturing to places like China. Now service and even white-collar jobs, like file clerks and data entry specialists or office support staff and mechanical drafters, are disappearing.
''Technology is always destroying jobs and always creating jobs, but in recent years the destruction has been happening faster than the creation,'' said Erik Brynjolfsson, an economist and director of the M.I.T. Center for Digital Business.
Still, the digital transition is creating enormous wealth and opportunity. Four of the most valuable American companies -- Apple, Google, Microsoft and I.B.M. -- are rooted in technology. And it was Apple, more than any other company, that set off the app revolution with the iPhone and iPad. Since Apple unleashed the world's freelance coders to build applications four years ago, it has paid them more than $6.5 billion in royalties.
Last year, federal statisticians changed the title and the exact composition of a jobs subcategory to reflect the new prominence of apps. And the tech industry has begun making claims about how apps are contributing to the broader economy.
A study commissioned by the tech advocacy group TechNet found that the ''app economy'' -- including Apple, Facebook, Google's Android and other app platforms -- was responsible, directly and indirectly, for 466,000 jobs. The study used a methodology that searched online help-wanted ads.
Using the same methodology, Apple said this month that its app business had generated 291,250 jobs for the American economy, as varied as developers and U.P.S. drivers. That number rose 39 percent in less than a year. During that time, the number of United States developers paying the $99 annual fee to register with Apple rose 10 percent to 275,000. Some of these registered developers have other full-time jobs and write apps in their spare time.
Apple has become increasingly assertive in promoting the economic benefits of apps as its own wealth and prominence have grown and its employment and other business practices have come under scrutiny. The company issued a statement for this article saying it was ''incredibly proud of the opportunities the App Store gives developers of all sizes,'' but declined to answer questions.
At the company's annual meeting this spring, the chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, noted that just a few years ago ''mobile app'' wasn't even in people's vocabulary. ''Now there's this enormous, entirely new job segment that didn't exist before,'' he said. ''Apple has become a jobs platform.''
Michael Mandel, the economist who conducted the TechNet study, said it was problematic to slice the jobs data as Apple had done. ''The guy who writes an Apple app one day will write an Android app the next day,'' he said. ''You can't add up all the numbers from every study to get the total number of jobs.''
For many of the developers not working at traditional companies, moreover, ''job'' is a misnomer. Streaming Color Studios, a game developer, did a survey of game makers late last year. The 252 respondents, while not a scientifically valid sample and restricted to one segment of the app market, indicated what many people had suspected: the app world is an ecology weighted heavily toward a few winners.
A quarter of the respondents said they had made less than $200 in lifetime revenue from Apple. A quarter had made more than $30,000, and 4 percent had made over $1 million.
A few apps have made it extremely big, including Instagram, the photo-sharing app that was bought by Facebook in April for $1 billion. When app developers dream, they dream of triumphs like that.
Most developers, however, make their money when someone buys or upgrades their app from Apple's online store, the only place consumers can buy an iPhone or iPad app.
Apple keeps 30 percent of each app sale. While its job creation report trumpets the $6.5 billion the company has paid out in royalties, it does not note that as much as half of that money goes to developers outside the United States. The pie, while growing rapidly, is smaller than it seems.
''My guess is that very few developers make a living off their own apps,'' said Jeff Scott, who runs the Apple app review site 148Apps.com and closely tracks developments in the field.
The Struggling Entrepreneur
Like many computer experts, Shawn Grimes started experimenting with apps almost as soon as Apple opened its doors for the iPhone. He wrote an Internet security program as well as a tool for studio photographers to manage portrait sessions. Those amateur apps pulled in more than $5,000 from Apple.
Late last year, Mr. Grimes was laid off as a computer security specialist by Legg Mason, the Baltimore financial firm. The dismissal shook his confidence. ''I worked really hard,'' he said. ''I did my best. But ultimately my career was not in my hands.''
The layoff, a result of Legg Mason's decision to eliminate the jobs of 300 tech support workers, had been in the works for more than a year, which gave Mr. Grimes and his wife, Stephanie, plenty of time to contemplate their future. They have strong family roots in the Baltimore area but would have moved for a position with a Silicon Valley giant.
Google, which receives two million applications a year, interviewed Mr. Grimes, but he did not make it past the preliminary stages.
With direct employment out of reach, he decided to work independently by writing apps. He had no illusion that he was likely to become rich. Mostly, he hoped to find satisfying work that paid enough to provide a middle-class living and some shelter from a shifting economy.
But with hundreds of new apps introduced every day in Apple's store, the field is overcrowded -- something the Grimeses learned quickly and painfully.
Ms. Grimes, 32, quit her job teaching kindergartners to join the couple's new venture, Campfire Apps. They downsized to a two-bedroom apartment. ''We either succeed and it's awesome, or we fail and it was awesome while it lasted,'' she said.
They worked steadily on apps that revolved around children. Henry's Smart Headlamp was a learning game for preschoolers, a hunt for hidden objects that the Grimeses hoped iPhone-wielding parents would think was worth $2 for a moment of distraction. A free version called Henry's Spooky Headlamp got 5,409 downloads during Halloween 2011.
The couple aimed for one new app a month, but progress was slow and sales were slower. In March, with the apps bringing in only about $20 a day, they cashed in Mr. Grimes's 401(k), which yielded $30,000 after taxes and penalties. They had already spent the severance from his job at Legg Mason.
One thing they never scrimped on was technology, especially Apple technology. At one point they owned a 24-inch iMac, a Mac Mini, a 24-inch cinema display screen, two 13-inch MacBook Airs, a 15-inch MacBook Pro, two iPad 2s, two Apple TVs, two iPhone 4s and an iPhone 3GS. ''We justify buying new models by saying we need them to test out the apps,'' Mr. Grimes said.
Soon, though, it got to the point where Mr. Grimes needed to take on freelance work, which brought in crucial income but took time away from Campfire Apps. By the beginning of summer, troubled by several persistent health care issues, he surrendered to the need for a full-time job.
Mr. Grimes now works as an app developer for ELC Technologies, an Oregon company that allowed him to stay in Baltimore. Ms. Grimes is still working on Campfire Apps.
While Mr. Grimes was angry at Legg Mason for laying him off, Apple delivered little -- but it also made no promises. ''People used to expect companies to take care of them,'' he said. ''Now you're in charge of your own destiny, for better or worse.''
The Grimeses' quest cost them more than $200,000 in lost income and savings. So far this year, their eight apps have earned $4,964. When the newest iPhone came out at the end of September, the couple immediately bought two.
Success Beyond Dreams
Ethan Nicholas was a Sun Microsystems programmer, a games enthusiast and a father of two very young boys, and he needed some extra cash. So in late 2008 he wrote an artillery game that could be played on the iPhone, which was still relatively new. There were about 11 million in circulation -- certainly a large number, but nothing like the 270 million that have now been sold.
Mr. Nicholas wrote iShoot in six weeks, in his spare time. It sold 17,000 copies at $2.99 each on a single day, Jan. 11, 2009. That was a Sunday. On Monday, he quit his job. By March, he had earned more than $1 million. ''Sheer dumb luck and being in the right place at the right time,'' he said.
Mr. Nicholas and a friend, Brent Miller, were inspired to form a company. ''We were going to make another million or two,'' said Mr. Miller, 38. But when none of their new games sold like iShoot, the pair moved in an entirely new direction. They founded echoBase, a start-up with 14 employees that is developing apps to allow doctors and nurses to view and update medical records across different computer systems. They brought in Mr. Miller's father, Rod, a former I.B.M. sales manager, as chief executive.
EchoBase has raised about $4 million. Most of that has come from dozens of small investors, but Mr. Nicholas and the Millers have contributed about $1 million. ''All of my savings and retirement account are gone,'' Brent Miller said. His father took out a second mortgage. Revenue is now coming in, with 3,200 doctors signed up, but the company is a long way from making a profit. Rod Miller forecast that it would become self-sustaining in 2013.
Mr. Nicholas has cautioned his new colleagues about easy money. ''The time for that has passed,'' he said.
EchoBase markets its service to medical records software providers and hospitals, whose doctors download the app free. Apple makes no money here, but it gets a long-term benefit: start-ups that succeed will embed the iPad and the iPhone more thoroughly into society.
The company is, in a sense, another arm of Apple's research and development program. ''The applications are what sells the hardware,'' Rod Miller said. ''Without us, and thousands of others like us, Apple has limited appeal.''
On one level, it was a strange move for Apple to open its devices to people like Mr. Grimes, Mr. Nicholas and the Millers. Imagine a violinist's horror at letting a toddler play with his Stradivarius and you would have some idea of Apple's reluctance to let anyone outside of its walls fool with any of its technology. This is a company that sealed batteries into its devices so people could not replace them.
Apple's brilliant but mercurial chief executive, Steven P. Jobs, agreed to unlock the gates of the fledgling iPhone only after much internal argument, and he made sure that Apple would retain strict oversight of every app. In retrospect, it might have been the smartest decision ever made by a company that prides itself on creating the future.
The App Store opened in July 2008 with 500 apps. In an interview, Mr. Jobs laid bare the company's goal: ''Sell more iPhones.''
And so, thanks in large part to the multitude of apps, it came to pass. More iPhones -- nearly seven million -- were sold in the next three months than in the entire previous year, and that was just the beginning of the ascent.
''Apps changed the iPhone from a simple phone into a mobile computer,'' said Mr. Scott of 148Apps.com.
Apple's financial documents show just how crucial app inventors are. If the developers stop developing, the company warned again last month, ''customers may choose not to buy the company's products.''
So far, there has not been much risk of revolt. Developers have expressed flickers of grumpiness at Apple's 30 percent cut of each app sale. A shadowy group calling itself the App Developer Union briefly posted a petition online this summer asking for ''something more equitable.'' Apple declined to comment about the union, which disappeared from the Web as mysteriously as it had arrived.
Mr. Nicholas has the same philosophy about Apple now as he did when he wrote iShoot. ''I'd rather get 70 percent of a large pie than all of a small pie,'' he said.

HEADLINE: On Being a Girl

BYLINE: By MARTHA SCHWENDENER

 BODY:
It is especially timely to see ''Angels and Tomboys: Girlhood in 19th-Century American Art'' at the Newark Museum after the recent election, in which women figured prominently. The exhibition covers a period when the female ancestors of today's American women became popular subjects of artistic representation. Eighty paintings, prints, photographs and sculptures, along with excerpts from literary texts, also show how concepts of childhood -- and particularly girlhood -- underwent significant changes during the 19th century.
The exhibition is not explicitly political; most of the works look rather tame by today's standards. And yet, many issues roil just under the surface, or would have been more apparent to contemporary viewers: the depiction of social and economic class, race and various forms of subjugation and exploitation. The impact of the Civil War registers in the later part of the show, reflecting changing education and labor conditions for women. 
The first text you see on the wall -- which is also quoted in the catalog by the show's organizer, Holly Pyne Connor, curator of 19th-century American art at the Newark Museum -- borrows a line from Henry James's novella ''Daisy Miller'' (1878), in which the character Daisy is described as an ''inscrutable combination of audacity and innocence.'' For Dr. Connor, those words also provide a basis for the angels and tomboys in the title.
The first images, though, are much less inscrutable. Ammi Phillips's portraits of a ''Boy in Red'' and a ''Girl in Pink,'' both from around 1832, and Erastus Salisbury Field's ''Mrs. Paul Smith and Her Twins'' (1835/1838) are from a period when parents dressed very young children in identical clothing and gender was readable only through certain markers in paintings: hair parted on the side for boys and in the middle for girls; boys carrying objects like hammers and girls wearing jewelry or carrying strawberries, which could represent either fecundity or talismans to ward off illness or evil spirits.
Innocence makes its appearance in the next gallery with Abbott Handerson Thayer's ''Angel'' (1887), on loan from the Smithsonian American Art Museum, and presented in a gold frame designed by the architect Stanford White. The painting depicts the artist's daughter Mary as a white-winged figure -- possibly, as the catalog suggests, a ''purifying, angelic being'' -- or even an ''angel of death,'' since Thayer's wife had recently been institutionalized for depression (in that era labeled ''hysteria'') and died in 1891.
Other angelic types include Cecilia Beaux's portrait of ''Fanny Travis Cochran'' (1887) and John Singer Sargent's ''Katherine Chase Pratt'' (1890), as well as William Merritt Chase's portrayals of his daughter Cosy.
The exhibition shifts into different terrain with works like Chase's ''Idle Hours,'' from around 1894, which shows children lounging outside in the grass and points, if indirectly, to the ideas of 17th- and 18th-century thinkers Jean-Jacques Rousseau and John Locke, who formulated theories about childhood and the ''natural'' tendencies of children, which could be shaped by education. These ideas of the malleable child are bolstered by Winslow Homer's painting of a girl ''Reading by the Brook'' (1879) and Edmund Charles Tarbell's portrait of his daughters ''Josephine and Mercie'' (1908) reading and writing studiously inside on a bright summer day.
But the question of who is educated and who is consigned to hard labor is raised in vernacular images like Myron H. Kimball's photograph ''Emancipated Slaves Brought From Louisiana by Col. Geo. H. Hanks'' (1863) and two 1890s photographs by Jacob Riis of poor urban girls, one a housecleaner and the other shown caring for an infant. Edward Lamson Henry's ''Kept In'' (1889), shows a young, dark-skinned girl in a schoolhouse, kept inside for detention and with her book cast aside -- an ambiguous image given that the education of African-Americans was prohibited in many states before the Civil War. Nearby is a painting by Lilly Martin Spencer, ''War Spirit at Home (Celebrating the Victory at Vicksburg)'' (1866), which suggests the fallout of the Civil War on the American family, with a disheveled interior and a nursing mother reading The New York Times, presumably with the names of the dead from the battle mentioned in the painting's title.
Tomboys show up in the last third of the exhibition, and they come with their own model from American literature. If Daisy Miller exhibited the ''audacity and innocence'' of American girlhood, the character Jo from Louisa May Alcott's ''Little Women'' (1868-69) serves, for Dr. Connor, as the archetype of the American tomboy.
Some of the key works here include John George Brown's depiction of a young girl, ''Swinging on the Gate,'' from around 1878 to 1879, and Eastman Johnson's ''Kite Flying'' (1865), as well as Homer's woodcut ''A Skating Scene'' (1868). Another vernacular image, a Currier & Ives lithograph titled ''Into Mischief,'' from around 1857, shows a toddler wreaking havoc in a nursery -- a rare image of a girl misbehaving, in a cultural landscape that included mischievous boys like Mark Twain's Tom Sawyer.
The sexual exploitation of children and its traumatic effects on them as adults, particularly women -- which were studied by neurologists in Europe like Jean-Martin Charcot and his protg, Sigmund Freud, and which were formulated as ''hysteria'' -- are generally overlooked here. Seymour Joseph Guy's painting ''Making a Train'' (1867), with a young girl playing dress-up in her bedroom, is about as close as the show gets to exploring the eroticism or sexualization of children.
But with many pieces on loan from institutions like the Smithsonian, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Brooklyn Museum, the Detroit Institute of Arts and the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, ''Angels and Tomboys'' is built from the annals of American art, and it offers a portrait of American girlhood that is democratic, probing and, at this moment, oddly topical.
''Angels and Tomboys: Girlhood in 19th-Century American Art'' is at the Newark Museum, 49 Washington Street, Newark, through Jan. 20. Information: (973) 596-6550 or newarkmuseum.org.

HEADLINE: The Take-It-on-Faith Condo

BYLINE: By MICHELLE HIGGINS

 BODY:
RISING demand and a scarcity of new apartments are creating something of a rush on new luxury condominiums in choice New York neighborhoods, with buyers increasingly signing contracts for spaces even before they are built.
Last month sales opened for 200 East 79th Street, a Skyline Developers project. The building is still going up, but already contracts have been signed for 25 of the 39 units. In late August the sales team for Sackett Union, 11 town houses and 32 condos being developed by Alchemy Properties in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, began calling prospective buyers who had asked to be notified when sales started. By the end of September, half the condos were in contract at the asking price, as well as one town house. As of last week, 24 of the condos had sold, as well as another town house.
All of those properties were snapped up in the construction phase. Most buyers had little more than a floor plan, some artists' renderings and perhaps a model kitchen and bathroom on which to base one of the most important purchases of their lives.
''We were inundated,'' said Kenneth S. Horn, Alchemy's president. ''There is such a dearth of new properties that if you deliver a nice product with nice finishes in a good area, they're going to sell.'' 
Housing inventory has been dropping across the country, with available listings in September down more than 30 and 40 percent respectively from a year ago in markets like Miami and San Francisco, according to Zillow.com. As a result, some condos in neighborhoods like Brickell in Miami and Mission Bay in San Francisco have been experiencing robust sales from floor plans as buildings go up.
In New York City, housing inventory was down about 25 percent in September from a year earlier, according to Zillow. But a combination of tight lending and high land costs means most of the buildings entering the market are relatively small -- thereby further intensifying the competition for new apartments. Of the 31 buildings that have opened or are projected to start sales by the end of the year, just one has more than 100 units, according to data compiled by the Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group.
In all, by the end of 2012, 1,249 new apartments are expected in the Manhattan market. That's up from just 277 new units last year, which had the second-lowest number of new units over the past decade (in 2009, more apartments were taken off the market than were listed). But it's still far from a peak of 8,052 in 2007.
After the 2008 financial collapse, these so-called presales dried up as buyers shied away from anything that wasn't finished, and concerns grew that developers wouldn't be able to deliver on their promises. ''Buyers became resistant to buying in a half-completed development,'' said Beth Fisher, a senior managing director of Corcoran Sunshine. ''They were risk-averse.''
It wasn't until the end of 2011, Ms. Fisher said, that off-site showrooms re-emerged and buying off the plan picked up again. Perhaps the most notable example of this phenomenon is One57, the high-profile tower that has yet to be completed across from Carnegie Hall. More than 60 percent of its 92 luxury apartments have sold -- including a penthouse that went into contract for more than $90 million -- since sales began about a year ago.
''It's really a supply-and-demand dynamic,'' Ms. Fisher said. ''If a market has the choice, it always prefers the completed product.''
Buying in early can have significant upside in a rising market. Prices at Chelsea Green, a nearly sold-out 51-unit condominium from Alfa Development going up at 151 West 21st Street, were raised four times since sales began in May. Now the two remaining two-bedroom two-baths are $2.7 million and $2.8 million, up $200,000 from their initial asking prices.
When sales started last September at 205 Water Street, a 65-unit Toll Brothers project in the Dumbo section of Brooklyn, apartments were priced around $825 a square foot. Over the course of a year, rates were raised more than 10 times; they ended up at an average of $875 a square foot.
And with some sales offices opening to long lists of potential buyers, there is even more pressure to get in early. In Brooklyn, 20 Henry Street, a 38-unit condo, started selling in February to 800 prospective buyers who had put their names on a waiting list. More than 85 percent of the building has since sold.
But there are also plenty of potential pitfalls when buying essentially sight unseen, including construction delays, rising interest rates, a smaller apartment than advertised and a different view than you had imagined when looking at the blueprints. Following are some things to consider when buying off the floor plan:
THE FINE PRINT Don't be intimidated by the offering plan. That big, bulky book, typically several hundred pages long, spells out the terms and conditions of the sale. Although many buyers rely on their lawyer (preferably one familiar with new construction) to study the plan, it is useful to look closely at a few sections yourself. Schedule A sets forth the price and projected common charge; Schedule B details the projected annual budget; and in a two- or three-page summary titled ''Special Risks,'' the developer discloses the possible ways your investment could be jeopardized.
THE SQUARE FOOTAGE There are myriad ways to determine the square footage of an apartment. Some developers measure from the exterior walls, which adds unusable space to the figure. Others include outdoor space like a balcony, part of the exterior hallway or storage space -- even if the storage unit is in the basement. ''That can add anywhere from 10 to 40 percent to a plan,'' said Dolly Lenz, a high-end broker at Prudential Douglas Elliman. ''It's really problematic.'' To avoid ending up with a unit smaller than indicated in the marketing materials, make sure you understand exactly how your apartment is measured.
THE FINISHES Many model apartments at preconstruction sales offices have sleek finishes, but some developers may offer substitutes in the end. The words ''or equivalent'' in the offering plan should be a red flag, said Sofia Song, the vice president for research of Streeteasy. ''You go into the sales centers and you're wowed by the finishes,'' she said, ''but instead of the Miele washer-dryer, you might be getting something else.''
THE FLOOR PLAN Factor in surrounding apartments. One question to ask, said Ms. Fisher of Corcoran Sunshine, is what is happening with the apartment above you. ''If it has a balcony,'' she pointed out, ''that may create a shaded condition for the space that's beneath it.'' Pay attention to the entire floor, including the number of apartments and the location of the elevator and the trash room. In other words, she said, ''are you right next to the garbage chute?''
THE FLOOR NUMBERS Eva Talel, a partner in the real estate group of Stroock & Stroock & Lavan, a law firm in Manhattan, said one client who had thought she was buying on the 14th floor was actually on the 12th. When looking at the building plans, she hadn't realized that the first two floors were below grade. In the end she stayed on the 12th, but negotiated a lower price.
CEILING HEIGHT Check this, too. So-called transfer floors tend to have high ceilings with irregularly located ceiling drops, to accommodate mechanical equipment. Be sure to ask whether your unit is on a transfer floor, and if so, where exactly the ceiling drops are going to be.
THE VIEW Know your air rights. Apartments on what are called ''lot lines'' could lose their view if the neighboring lot was developed. To prevent that from happening and preserve views for their buildings, some developers buy the air rights from surrounding buildings.
That's what Alchemy Properties did at 35 West 15th Street, where it is building a condo atop Xavier High School, which has adjoining property west and north. Most nearby buildings are no higher than six stories at the moment, but buying the surrounding air rights from Xavier will help maintain uninterrupted views from the condo, said Mr. Horn of Alchemy Properties.
Another informative tactic would be to pay a visit to the building next door. ''I know it seems very forward,'' said John Wollberg, an executive director of sales for Halstead Property, ''but try and ask someone in a building that you think may have a comparable view if you can come over.'' Sure, you may be turned down, he added, but to increase your chances, he said he would ''handwrite a note to personally ask if there is any way I can impose upon them to come and look at the view for two seconds.''
TIMING Expect delays. ''The biggest pitfall with buying new construction is timing,'' said David J. Maundrell III, the founder of aptsandlofts.com, which specializes in marketing new developments. ''There are always construction delays, even if everything is going very, very well.''
Mr. Maundrell recommends building at least six months of flexibility into your move-in date to be safe. Don't bother trying to lock in a mortgage rate when the timetable is still moving, he said. If your rate lock expires before you can close, you will have to go through the additional cost and hassle of locking in a new rate and possibly, getting a new appraisal. Wait until the building obtains a temporary certificate of occupancy and the tax lots are divided. At that point, Mr. Maundrell said, ''the likelihood that you can move in in the next 30 to 60 days is very good.''
To cover your bases, Barry Weidenbaum, a Manhattan real estate lawyer, recommends adding a clause in the purchase agreement setting a ''drop-dead date'' that requires the developer to cancel the contract and return the deposit if he or she is unable to close by then.
It behooves buyers, he added, to obtain this kind of solid mortgage contingency, as many banks will not lend in a building until a certain number of units are sold. ''Find out expected completion dates, number of units in contract, and number of units closed and status of the company and tax abatements, if any,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Obama's Road to Myanmar Is Paved With New Asia Intentions

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER and JANE PERLEZ; Peter Baker reported from Washington, and Jane Perlez from Beijing. Thomas Fuller contributed reporting from Yangon, Myanmar, and Wai Moe from Naypyidaw, Myanmar.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- On the stump this fall, President Obama boasted that he had ''brought more trade cases against China'' than his predecessor had. In an ad, he asserted that his challenger ''never stood up to China.'' During a debate, Mr. Obama said he expanded trade with other Asian nations ''so that China starts feeling more pressure'' to play by the rules.
The contest with Mitt Romney is over, but the contest with China is only gathering steam. After a political campaign spent talking about how tough he was with Beijing, the newly re-elected president departed for Asia on Saturday for his first postelection overseas trip, a whirlwind swing through China's backyard that is fraught with geopolitical implications.
Mr. Obama will make a historic visit to Myanmar to mark the emergence of the long-isolated country and encourage its migration from China's orbit toward a more democratic future with the West. He will also stop in Thailand, America's longtime ally in the region as well as a friend of China's. And he will fly to Cambodia for a summit meeting of a Southeast Asian organization as the United States tries to increase its influence in that part of the region. 
With the election over, the White House has softened its language, and presents the trip not as an explicit attempt to contain China but as the next stage of its so-called pivot to Asia, reorienting American foreign policy after a decade of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan toward the economic and political future of the Pacific. On the cusp of a second term, Mr. Obama sees such a shift as a mission for the next four years and a possible legacy.
''The president's trip marks the beginning of the next phase of our rebalancing effort,'' Thomas E. Donilon, the president's national security adviser, said in a speech at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. ''When the president says the United States will play a larger and long-term role in the region, we intend to execute on that commitment.''
But when the Obama team talks about ''rebalancing,'' Mr. Donilon said it meant ''both toward the Asia-Pacific and within the Asia-Pacific,'' meaning more engagement with nations like Myanmar, Thailand and Cambodia. As for China, he said, the relationship ''has elements of both cooperation and competition.''
The political centerpiece of the trip is the scheduled six-hour visit to Myanmar, which is considered strategic in the reorientation to Asia not only because of its location bordering China, but because its leaders have signaled their pique with China's relentless search for natural resources and their willingness to tilt toward the West as a way of counterbalancing their imposing neighbor.
Although the trip to Yangon was scheduled to coincide with the Asian summit meeting, the symbolism of Mr. Obama's visit -- the first by a sitting United States president -- has not been lost on China, a longtime patron.
In Beijing, where Xi Jinping has just been installed as the new leader in a once-in-a-decade transition, the trip is seen as part of a continuing challenge to China's rise. The government interprets America's attention on the region, including the deployment of more troops and battleships, as an effort to encircle China.
''The pivot is a very stupid choice,'' said Jin Canrong, a professor at the School of International Studies at Renmin University in Beijing. ''The United States has achieved nothing and only annoyed China. China can't be contained.''
On China's periphery, where its rapid military modernization and territorial claims in resource-rich seas are viewed with nervousness, Mr. Obama's pivot is mostly welcomed. Many in the region, however, worry about whether the United States has the money and will to follow through. There is also a question over how much impact the United States can have, no matter its commitment. China has the edge in trade; every country in the region except the Philippines does more business with China than with the United States.
''That's happened over the last five years, faster than expected,'' said Peter Drysdale, head of the East Asian Bureau of Economic Research at the Australian National University. ''The disparity of the scale of what's going on with China and the region compared to the United States will grow.''
Mr. Obama's trip follows visits to the region in recent days by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta. The president stops in Bangkok on Sunday before heading to Myanmar.
In Yangon, Mr. Obama will meet with President Thein Sein, a former general who has led Myanmar's opening, releasing many political prisoners and freeing the long-persecuted opposition to run for seats in Parliament. The president will also meet with Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the Nobel laureate who emerged from years of house arrest to win one of those seats.
But while Mr. Obama wraps himself in the evolving success story -- the United States bet that it was worth easing sanctions early on as an encouragement to reformers -- some human rights activists deemed the visit a premature vanity exercise. They pointed to the continued detention of some political prisoners, a recent sectarian conflict they believe the government has done too little to stop and the Myanmar military's war with ethnic rebels.
Among those who initially urged against the trip, activists in the United States said, was Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi.
''It rewards Burma for things they've already been rewarded for, and it wastes enormous political capital which could have been saved up and used to reward future events,'' said John Sifton, Asia advocacy director for Human Rights Watch, who added that Mr. Obama should now leverage the trip by insisting on tangible action like the release of remaining political prisoners.
Mr. Donilon said the trip would help ''lock in this path forward'' but acknowledged risks. ''We're not nave about this,'' he said. ''We absolutely are aware of the dangers of backsliding. And if that takes place, we'll respond accordingly. But this really is a moment that we didn't want to miss.''
In Myanmar, the visit is seen as a validation of the move from military rule. ''Obama's visit is the first after he was re-elected,'' said Htay Oo, vice chairman of the governing Union Solidarity and Development Party. ''It means he takes our country seriously.'' But he stressed that change was coming from within, not from the United States.
The visit represents a shock to China, which considers Myanmar strategically important because of its access to the Indian Ocean, making it a shortcut for oil deliveries from the Middle East. But privately, some Chinese analysts said China overplayed its hand in tapping Myanmar's natural resources, citing as an example a backlash against a $3.6 billion hydroelectric dam at Myitsone -- a project that was suspended last year amid outrage that 90 percent of its electricity was destined for China, not power-poor Myanmar.
''People make a link in their minds between Chinese investment and previous military rule,'' said Yan Myo Thein, a former student activist who writes on politics in Myanmar's media.
For Mr. Obama, the test in the next few days will be to persuade China's Asian neighbors that the United States is their partner and, despite doubts, staying in the region for the long haul.
''Despite the current U.S. administration's bold rhetoric, America will in all probability look increasingly inward, as it has historically been prone to do after major wars,'' Bilahari Kausikan, the permanent secretary at Singapore's Foreign Ministry, told a conference in San Francisco last month. ''A period of introspection to lick the political and economic wounds is likely.''

HEADLINE: Disco's New Big Band Era

BYLINE: By MIKE RUBIN

 BODY:
ON a Saturday afternoon last month a crowd packed into a studio on an industrial block in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, to see the electronic dance music ensemble the Crystal Ark Party Machine. As a D.J. played acid-house tracks, two female singers wearing purple-and-white tie-dyed robes and starfish tiaras shook gourds and spun around like dervishes, uttering Spanish incantations. A man with a shaved head and a woman with Cleopatra bangs, both wearing emerald-green, sequin-trimmed oversize jumpsuits, danced beside them. As they vogued to the tribal throb, it became apparent that the backs of their outfits were actually see-through mesh, the only part of the spectacle that left little to the imagination. 
At the heart of this electric circus was an unlikely ringmaster. Behind a set of turntables, wearing a white suit and matching Kangol cap, Gavin Russom clutched a microphone and sang in falsetto. Best known to more mainstream audiences as a former keyboardist for LCD Soundsystem, Mr. Russom has been recording for almost a decade under aliases like Delia and Gavin, Black Leotard Front and Black Meteoric Star, but until now his hypnotic, analog-synthesizer-driven music has been more after-party than party-starting. ''I wanted to make some music to make people feel really excited about having a body,'' Mr. Russom said. ''It's about the enthusiasm of being alive and in a body and the kind of liberation that grows out of that.''
He is not alone in wanting to build a bridge between the concert stage and the dance floor. While technology has enabled virtually anyone with a laptop to become a one-man band, a handful of New York dance music artists have moved in the opposite direction, assembling mini-orchestras to perform what had largely been a studio-only music in a live setting. While there were relatively few disco bands known for their live concerts during the music's late-'70s and early-'80s heyday, there are now at least three New York big bands -- all of which have released debut albums within the last year -- who borrow liberally from disco's sonic palette: a 4/4 ''four on the floor'' beat, the warm sound of analog synthesizers, live percussion and soulful female vocals.
Taking its inspiration from New York disco labels like Prelude and West End, Escort has become one of the city's tautest live acts, the stage overflowing with as many as 17 musicians, including horn and string sections and a chorus of female singers led by the Parisian expat Adeline Michle. With only nine members Midnight Magic blends disco, soul, funk, and electro, focusing around the saucy stage persona of its vocalist, Tiffany Roth, a cross between Bette Midler and Chaka Khan. The full nine-member lineup of Crystal Ark (the Party Machine is its truncated, six-member D.J.-driven configuration) is propelled not only by Mr. Russom's pulsating keyboards but by Afro-Latin rhythms, with vocals by Viva Ruiz frequently sung in Spanish.
The music of Escort, Midnight Magic and the Crystal Ark ''has very clear and specific echoes to disco, in varying degrees,'' said Peter Shapiro, the author of the 2005 book ''Turn the Beat Around: The Secret History of Disco.'' ''Crystal Ark is probably the least 'discoesque' of the three, but Gavin Russom is channeling his kind of shamanistic impulse through dance music in general, and to the extent that disco has certain trance and ritualistic tendencies, I think it taps into that.''
Released last month on DFA Records, the Crystal Ark's album, ''The Crystal Ark,'' is teeming with contagious grooves, referring not just to Mr. Russom's touchstones like German kosmische music and Chicago house but also the mesmeric energy of Afro-Cuban bat drumming and Afro-Brazilian Candombl religious music. The Crystal Ark live looks like what might have happened if Andy Warhol's Exploding Plastic Inevitable had been realized instead by the filmmaker Jack Smith: the stage bursting with musicians, a pulsing psychedelic light show and visuals, campy costumes and a polymorphous panoply of exotic dancers. ''We're proponents of shamelessness, for sure,'' said Ms. Ruiz, Mr. Russom's key collaborator in Crystal Ark, herself a member of the clothes-optional downtown troupe the Dazzle Dancers.
''One of the things that I think is cool about disco was that disco is American urban music and in a lot of ways New York music,'' Mr. Russom said. ''Something about disco supported the coexistence of Latin sounds, white sounds, African sounds, African-American sounds, gay sounds, straight sounds, all these different things. All those distinctions got kind of melted away.''
The same could also be said about the Crystal Ark. ''It's a great multicultural pansexual melting pot,'' said Jonathan Galkin, a co-founder of DFA Records, ''probably the most truly New York-flavored music we've ever released.''
Like disco's original flowering, this latest strain of electronic music, often called nu-disco, has strong New York roots. In the early 2000s New York producers like Daniel Wang and the duo Metro Area created a vibrant revisionist take on electrodisco, D.J.'s like Brennan Green, James Murphy and the duo Rub-N-Tug dug deep into the record crates of disco history, and labels like DFA Records helped popularize dance music to an indie-rock crowd. Today disco's warm analog feel offers an alternative to the incredibly synthetic sound of mainstream electronic dance music producers like David Guetta. Dance parties like Discovery, Let's Play House, Mister Saturday Night, All Night Rong and Nouveau York take place in downtown Manhattan and in Brooklyn (in Williamsburg, Bushwick and Clinton Hill), attended primarily by young, diverse crowds from a generation that has grown up without prejudice toward dance music.
Yet while disco's polyglot spirit has been continuously percolating in New York clubs, live dance music remained a rarity. Escort began putting out 12-inch singles and playing live shows in New York in 2006 but only released a debut album, ''Escort,'' in the last year and last month released ''Escort Remixed,'' both on its own Escort Records. The group briefly enjoyed some notoriety in 2007 when its ''All Through the Night'' video (edited with dancing and lip-syncing Muppets) went viral, but found taking so many musicians on the road economically unfeasible. The band has only recently gotten a booking agent and begun touring.
Scheduling rehearsals for 17 members remains a logistical nightmare. ''It's very similar to baseball,'' Eugene Cho, the Escort keyboardist, said. ''I have a depth chart for the band because I can't get all of the people to play every single show, so sometimes I have to go two or three levels deep when we're putting our roster together.''
The seeds of Midnight Magic were planted when four members of the group were in the backing band for the disco revivalist outfit Hercules and Love Affair in 2008. ''We all share the love for those certain eras of recording and those kind of artists and that kind of sound palette,'' said W. Andrew Raposo, the bassist for Midnight Magic, whose debut album, ''Walking the Midnight Streets,'' was released this month on its own Midnight Sun Sound label. ''There's something really enjoyable and fun and thrilling about using analog equipment because you can push it in such weird ways. It's really a different thing every time you turn it on.''
Analog gear also holds a powerful appeal for Mr. Russom, who taught himself how to build modular synthesizers. ''You really do take this electricity that could kill you, and by using these different components you fashion it into this thing that makes this really beautiful sound,'' he said. ''It's a kind of magic.''
And Mr. Russom knows from magic. In his early days in New York he performed as a stage magician called the Mystic Satin, and his flair for the theatrical was evident during his years in collaboration with the artist Delia Gonzalez, when his long hair and wizardly beard made him resemble a hybrid of Rasputin and the Roxy Music-era Brian Eno.
Desperate for work in 2001, Mr. Russom advertised his vintage synth proficiency in an e-mail sent to some 600 people, he recalled. Mr. Murphy, a founder of DFA records, was the only respondent, and Mr. Russom soon became DFA's house technician and an important influence on the label's sound. Eventually he was drafted by Mr. Murphy to play keyboards on LCD Soundsystem's final album and farewell tour. At sold-out concerts, Mr. Russom witnessed huge crowds having a profound and powerful reaction to the band's music.
''To really see how much that did for people,'' Mr. Russom said, ''made me feel like it would make sense to make the Crystal Ark a band and let it evolve to become this thing that it seemed to want to become.''
Improbably enough in this era of international superstar D.J.'s Mr. Russom's vision may have found its moment in New York, where disco also had its initial splash. ''The thing that's magical about New York is that all these things that nobody thinks could work together all work together and are just dancing around each other all the time,'' Mr. Russom said. ''That's a place that we try to create in the music and the performances, a kind of magical space.''

HEADLINE: Reconsidering the Rev. Best Friend

BYLINE: By VINCENT M. MALLOZZI

 BODY:
IN the days leading up to their August wedding at the Ram's Head Inn on Shelter Island, Kinara Flagg and Paul Fileri chose Andrew Case, a friend and former law school classmate of Ms. Flagg's, to officiate.
In the eyes of the couple, Mr. Case, who had become a Universal Life minister through a quick online ordination, was the right man for the job. In the eyes of the law, however, Mr. Case, who was not a part of an active ministry, was officiating in the wrong county.
An increasing number of couples are steering away from traditional religious and civil wedding officiants in favor of friends and relatives who become ordained through online ministries. But many couples are unaware that while New York State recognizes marriages performed by those who became ministers by the power vested in a mouse, there are five downstate counties where such officiants are not technically legal.
Ms. Flagg and Mr. Fileri, who knew that Suffolk County on Long Island, which includes Shelter Island, was among the handful of no-online-minister zones in the state, obtained their marriage license in Monroe County (where Mr. Fileri grew up and which recognizes online ministries), making their wedding a legal union after all. 
''It's surprising that Suffolk County does not recognize these online ministers,'' Ms. Flagg said.
Neither do the counties of Nassau, Westchester, Putnam or Dutchess, owing to a 1989 ruling by the Appellate Division of the State Supreme Court in a case involving a Suffolk County couple who were then embroiled in a divorce. In that case, the court ruled that the couple's marriage and prenuptial agreement were void because their officiant was a Universal Life minister.
Though Ms. Flagg speaks for many married couples when she says ''we wanted a friend to marry us, someone who could speak about us to our friends and family, rather than a person who doesn't really know us and recites a lot of formulaic vows,'' it remains that Connecticut, Alabama, Virginia, Tennessee, a part of Pennsylvania and (of all places) Las Vegas do not necessarily recognize the credentials of officiants who were created, for better or worse, through such online ministries as the Universal Life Church, the Church of Spiritual Humanism, Rose Ministries and the Temple of Earth.
For many years, New York City also did not recognize online ministers, but in 2006 began allowing them to officiate at weddings in the five boroughs. But the appellate court's ruling still holds for the other counties. (In September 2007, a couple in York County, Pa., who had been married two months earlier by an online minister received a call from a county clerk who told them that a judge had ruled that ministers who do not have a ''regularly established church or congregation'' cannot perform marriages under state law. Their marriage, they were told, might not be valid. Representatives of the American Civil Liberties Union advised them to seek help from the organization if the legality of their marriage was ever challenged.)
New York Assemblywoman Sandy Galef, a Westchester County Democrat, who has been trying since 2005 to pass a bill in Albany that would give online officiants legal power to marry couples throughout the state, said, ''We need to change the law so that people everywhere can be legally married by online ministers.''
''I have had lots of conversations about this issue with the Judiciary Committee staff in Albany, and everyone knows something needs to be done,'' Ms. Galef said. ''I'm not quite sure what is blocking this bill. Is there opposition from priests, rabbis and other clergymen who see this as both a competitive and economic thing? I just don't know.''
The Rev. Kent Winters-Hazelton, who once served in a no-online-minister zone at the United Community Church of Wantagh on Long Island, in Nassau County, and is now pastor of the First Presbyterian Church in Lawrence, Kan., said that he understood why some states still do not recognize online ministers.
''In some places, there is still an understanding that certain qualifications have to be met by a minister or a justice of the peace before they are legally able to perform marriages,'' he said. ''And I agree with that.''
Mr. Winters-Hazelton, who graduated with a four-year bachelor's degree in religious studies from the University of California, Santa Barbara, before earning a three-year master of divinity degree at Princeton Theological Seminary that enabled him to be ordained in the Presbyterian Church, has been pastoring for 27 years. Along the way, he earned a three-year degree in social ethics at the Union Theological Seminary in Manhattan.
''My colleagues in ministry who have received extensive training to become eligible for ordination are recognized by the state in the same way that the state recognizes an attorney who has passed the bar exam,'' he said. ''You wouldn't go to an attorney if you knew he got his degree online and paid $20 for it.''
Still, Ms. Galef said, she was unaware of any political opposition to her proposal outside of some lawmakers who might not have wanted to see this legislative effort get caught up with the push for legalizing same-sex marriage in the state. She added that until such a law is passed, any couple using an online minister in those five counties should consider tying the knot a bit tighter by adding a second, legally recognized officiant to the ceremony.
''Just to be safe,'' Ms. Galef said, ''and to know that down the road, there will be no major legal issues regarding things like prenuptial agreements, adoptions, pensions and inheritances, which are all tied to a legal marriage.''
In August, Andrea Hailey and David Williamson took a page out of Ms. Galef's wedding planner. They were married at the Union Chapel in the Grove on Shelter Island in a ceremony led by Representative Linda Snchez, Democrat of California, who had also become a Universal Life minister. Yet Ms. Hailey and Mr. Williamson had the Rev. Robert Stuart, a retired Presbyterian minister, legally solemnize their marriage certificate.
''At the end of the day, we just wanted to be 100 percent sure and to not feel as if our commitment to one another lay within the boundaries of some legal gray area,'' Ms. Hailey said. ''It's crazy to think that some couples out there do not know that their marriages were not in accordance with the law. That's why a second officiant is so important: it leaves nothing open for argument.''
According to Michael McSweeney, the New York city clerk, couples with a marriage license from any of the five boroughs can be married anywhere in New York State. The license must, however, be signed by the officiant and returned to where it was originally issued. But that makes little sense to Ms. Galef.
''I don't understand how we can have a domestic relations law that is interpreted one way by the five boroughs of New York City and another way by different areas of New York State,'' she said. ''We have to get this fixed.''

HEADLINE: If You've Got the Skills, She's Got the Job

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
ST. Paul
TRACI TAPANI is not your usual C.E.O. For the last 19 years, she and her sister have been co-presidents of Wyoming Machine, a sheet metal company they inherited from their father in Stacy, Minn. I met Tapani at a meeting convened by the Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development to discuss one of its biggest challenges today: finding the skilled workers that employers need to run local businesses. I'll let Tapani take it from here:
''About 2009,'' she explained, ''when the economy was collapsing and there was a lot of unemployment, we were working with a company that got a contract to armor Humvees,'' so her 55-person company ''had to hire a lot of people. I was in the market looking for 10 welders. I had lots and lots of applicants, but they did not have enough skill to meet the standard for armoring Humvees. Many years ago, people learned to weld in a high school shop class or in a family business or farm, and they came up through the ranks and capped out at a certain skill level. They did not know the science behind welding,'' so could not meet the new standards of the U.S. military and aerospace industry. 
''They could make beautiful welds,'' she said, ''but they did not understand metallurgy, modern cleaning and brushing techniques'' and how different metals and gases, pressures and temperatures had to be combined. Moreover, in small manufacturing businesses like hers, explained Tapani, ''unlike a Chinese firm that does high-volume, low-tech jobs, we do a lot of low-volume, high-tech jobs, and each one has its own design drawings. So a welder has to be able to read and understand five different design drawings in a single day.''
Tapani eventually found a welder from another firm who had passed the American Welding Society Certified Welding Inspector exam, the industry's gold standard, and he trained her welders -- some of whom took several tries to pass the exam -- so she could finish the job. Since then, Tapani trained a woman from Stacy, who had originally learned welding to make ends meet as a single mom. She took on the challenge of becoming a certified welding inspector, passed the exam and Tapani made her the company's own in-house instructor, no longer relying on the local schools.
''She knows how to read a weld code. She can write work instructions and make sure that the people on the floor can weld to that instruction,'' so ''we solved the problem by training our own people,'' said Tapani, adding that while schools are trying hard, training your own workers is often the only way for many employers to adapt to ''the quick response time'' demanded for ''changing skills.'' But even getting the right raw recruits is not easy. Welding ''is a $20-an-hour job with health care, paid vacations and full benefits,'' said Tapani, but ''you have to have science and math. I can't think of any job in my sheet metal fabrication company where math is not important. If you work in a manufacturing facility, you use math every day; you need to compute angles and understand what happens to a piece of metal when it's bent to a certain angle.''
Who knew? Welding is now a STEM job -- that is, a job that requires knowledge of science, technology, engineering and math.
Employers across America will tell you similar stories. It's one reason we have three million open jobs around the country but 8 percent unemployment. We're in the midst of a perfect storm: a Great Recession that has caused a sharp increase in unemployment and a Great Inflection -- a merger of the information technology revolution and globalization that is simultaneously wiping out many decent-wage, middle-skilled jobs, which were the foundation of our middle class, and replacing them with decent-wage, high-skilled jobs. Every decent-paying job today takes more skill and more education, but too many Americans aren't ready. This problem awaits us after the ''fiscal cliff.''
''We need to be honest; there is a big case for Keynesian-style stimulus today, but that is not going to solve all our problems,'' said the Harvard University labor economist Lawrence Katz. ''The main reason the unemployment rate is higher today than it was in 2007, before the Great Recession, is because we have an ongoing cyclical unemployment problem -- a lack of aggregate demand for labor -- initiated by the financial crisis and persisting with continued housing market problems, consumers still deleveraging, the early cessation of fiscal stimulus compounded by cutbacks by state and local governments.'' This is the main reason we went from around 5 percent to 8 percent unemployment.
But what is also true, says Katz, was that even before the Great Recession we had a mounting skills problem as a result of 25 years of U.S. education failing to keep up with rising skills demands, and it's getting worse. There was almost a doubling of the college wage premium from 1980 to 2007 -- that is, the extra income you earn from getting a two- or four-year degree. This was because there was a surge in demand for higher skills, as globalization and the I.T. revolution intensified, combined with a slowdown in the growth of supply of higher skills.
Many community colleges and universities simply can't keep pace and teach to the new skill requirements, especially with their budgets being cut. We need a new ''Race to the Top'' that will hugely incentivize businesses to embed workers in universities to teach -- and universities to embed professors inside businesses to learn -- so we get a much better match between schooling and the job markets.
''The world no longer cares about what you know; the world only cares about what you can do with what you know,'' explains Tony Wagner of Harvard, the author of ''Creating Innovators: The Making of Young People Who Will Change the World.''
Eduardo Padrn, the president of Miami Dade College, the acclaimed pioneer in education-for-work, put it this way: ''The skill shortage is real. Years ago, we started working with over 100 companies to meet their needs. Every program that we offer has an industry advisory committee that helps us with curriculum, mentorship, internships and scholarships. ... Spanish-speaking immigrants used to be able to come here and get a decent job doing repetitive tasks in an office or factory and earn enough to buy a home and car and put their kids through school and enjoy middle-class status. That is no longer possible. ... The big issue in America is not the fiscal deficit, but the deficit in understanding about education and the role it plays in the knowledge economy.''
The time when education -- particularly the right kind of education -- ''could be a luxury for the few is long gone,'' Padrn added.

HEADLINE: Rockaways Nightmares

BYLINE: By MICHAEL POLLAK

 BODY:
Q. The recent devastation wrought on the Rockaway Beach peninsula in Queens by Hurricane Sandy made me wonder: Why is there such a huge concentration of nursing homes in the Rockaways? 
A. The urban renewal programs of the 1950s and 1960s are a big part of the story.
''Blessed with the Atlantic Ocean to the south and Jamaica Bay to the north, the Rockaways became a popular resort area of elegant hotels and fine houses in the 1830s,'' Julia Vitullo-Martin, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, wrote in 2008. ''The coming of the railroad in the 1880s encouraged more intensive development, including playlands, amusement parks and a few apartment buildings. Attractive beachfront communities were developed, such as Belle Harbor, Neponsit and Arverne. The opening of the Cross Bay Bridge in 1925 and the Marine Parkway Bridge in 1937 made the Rockaways convenient for middle- and working-class households, who bought the bungalows.''
After World War II, more highways and air travel changed vacation habits, and property values declined. The urban renewal program of slum clearance, a federal program begun in 1949 and locally controlled by Robert Moses, used eminent domain to acquire and destroy thousands of the remaining bungalows. ''Many had already been converted into substandard welfare housing,'' Jack Eichenbaum, the Queens borough historian, said. In their place went swaths of public housing projects.
Ms. Vitullo-Martin wrote, ''The city also used federal and state financing to support the development of dozens of nursing homes.''
One reason for building housing projects in the Rockaways was that their residents were thought not to need easy access to the city's job centers. The same reasoning made the peninsula a logical choice for nursing homes. As with much of urban renewal, it seemed like a good idea at the time.
For decades, the housing stock in much of the Rockaways has been chaotic, with small and tall jumbled together. In 2008, the city adopted a major rezoning plan for the Rockaways intended to rationalize development, preserve the surviving bungalows and encourage more retail commerce.

HEADLINE: How To Live Without Irony

BYLINE: By CHRISTY WAMPOLE

 BODY:
If irony is the ethos of our age - and it is - then the hipster is our archetype of ironic living.
The hipster haunts every city street and university town. Manifesting a nostalgia for times he never lived himself, this contemporary urban harlequin appropriates outmoded fashions (the mustache, the tiny shorts), mechanisms (fixed-gear bicycles, portable record players) and hobbies (home brewing, playing trombone). He harvests awkwardness and self-consciousness. Before he makes any choice, he has proceeded through several stages of self-scrutiny. The hipster is a scholar of social forms, a student of cool. He studies relentlessly, foraging for what has yet to be found by the mainstream. He is a walking citation; his clothes refer to much more than themselves. He tries to negotiate the age-old problem of individuality, not with concepts, but with material things. 
He is an easy target for mockery. However, scoffing at the hipster is only a diluted form of his own affliction. He is merely a symptom and the most extreme manifestation of ironic living. For many Americans born in the 1980s and 1990s - members of Generation Y, or Millennials - particularly middle-class Caucasians, irony is the primary mode with which daily life is dealt. One need only dwell in public space, virtual or concrete, to see how pervasive this phenomenon has become. Advertising, politics, fashion, television: almost every category of contemporary reality exhibits this will to irony.Take, for example, an ad that calls itself an ad, makes fun of its own format, and attempts to lure its target market to laugh at and with it. It pre-emptively acknowledges its own failure to accomplish anything meaningful. No attack can be set against it, as it has already conquered itself. The ironic frame functions as a shield against criticism. The same goes for ironic living. Irony is the most self-defensive mode, as it allows a person to dodge responsibility for his or her choices, aesthetic and otherwise. To live ironically is to hide in public. It is flagrantly indirect, a form of subterfuge, which means etymologically to "secretly flee" (subter + fuge). Somehow, directness has become unbearable to us.
How did this happen? It stems in part from the belief that this generation has little to offer in terms of culture, that everything has already been done, or that serious commitment to any belief will eventually be subsumed by an opposing belief, rendering the first laughable at best and contemptible at worst. This kind of defensive living works as a pre-emptive surrender and takes the form of reaction rather than action.
Life in the Internet age has undoubtedly helped a certain ironic sensibility to flourish. An ethos can be disseminated quickly and widely through this medium. Our incapacity to deal with the things at hand is evident in our use of, and increasing reliance on, digital technology. Prioritizing what is remote over what is immediate, the virtual over the actual, we are absorbed in the public and private sphere by the little devices that take us elsewhere.
Furthermore, the nostalgia cycles have become so short that we even try to inject the present moment with sentimentality, for example, by using certain digital filters to "pre-wash" photos with an aura of historicity. Nostalgia needs time. One cannot accelerate meaningful remembrance.
While we have gained some skill sets (multitasking, technological savvy), other skills have suffered: the art of conversation, the art of looking at people, the art of being seen, the art of being present. Our conduct is no longer governed by subtlety, finesse, grace and attention, all qualities more esteemed in earlier decades. Inwardness and narcissism now hold sway.
Born in 1977, at the tail end of Generation X, I came of age in the 1990s, a decade that, bracketed neatly by two architectural crumblings - of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the Twin Towers in 2001 - now seems relatively irony-free. The grunge movement was serious in its aesthetics and its attitude, with a combative stance against authority, which the punk movement had also embraced. In my perhaps over-nostalgic memory, feminism reached an unprecedented peak, environmentalist concerns gained widespread attention, questions of race were more openly addressed: all of these stirrings contained within them the same electricity and euphoria touching generations that witness a centennial or millennial changeover.
But Y2K came and went without disaster. We were hopeful throughout the '90s, but hope is such a vulnerable emotion; we needed a self-defense mechanism, for every generation has one. For Gen Xers, it was a kind of diligent apathy. We actively did not care. Our archetype was the slacker who slouched through life in plaid flannel, alone in his room, misunderstood. And when we were bored with not caring, we were vaguely angry and melancholic, eating anti-depressants like they were candy.
FROM this vantage, the ironic clique appears simply too comfortable, too brainlessly compliant. Ironic living is a first-world problem. For the relatively well educated and financially secure, irony functions as a kind of credit card you never have to pay back. In other words, the hipster can frivolously invest in sham social capital without ever paying back one sincere dime. He doesn't own anything he possesses.
Obviously, hipsters (male or female) produce a distinct irritation in me, one that until recently I could not explain. They provoke me, I realized, because they are, despite the distance from which I observe them, an amplified version of me.
I, too, exhibit ironic tendencies. For example, I find it difficult to give sincere gifts. Instead, I often give what in the past would have been accepted only at a White Elephant gift exchange: a kitschy painting from a thrift store, a coffee mug with flashy images of "Texas, the Lone Star State," plastic Mexican wrestler figures. Good for a chuckle in the moment, but worth little in the long term. Something about the responsibility of choosing a personal, meaningful gift for a friend feels too intimate, too momentous. I somehow cannot bear the thought of a friend disliking a gift I'd chosen with sincerity. The simple act of noticing my self-defensive behavior has made me think deeply about how potentially toxic ironic posturing could be.
First, it signals a deep aversion to risk. As a function of fear and pre-emptive shame, ironic living bespeaks cultural numbness, resignation and defeat. If life has become merely a clutter of kitsch objects, an endless series of sarcastic jokes and pop references, a competition to see who can care the least (or, at minimum, a performance of such a competition), it seems we've made a collective misstep. Could this be the cause of our emptiness and existential malaise? Or a symptom?
Throughout history, irony has served useful purposes, like providing a rhetorical outlet for unspoken societal tensions. But our contemporary ironic mode is somehow deeper; it has leaked from the realm of rhetoric into life itself. This ironic ethos can lead to a vacuity and vapidity of the individual and collective psyche. Historically, vacuums eventually have been filled by something - more often than not, a hazardous something. Fundamentalists are never ironists; dictators are never ironists; people who move things in the political landscape, regardless of the sides they choose, are never ironists.
Where can we find other examples of nonironic living? What does it look like? Nonironic models include very young children, elderly people, deeply religious people, people with severe mental or physical disabilities, people who have suffered, and those from economically or politically challenged places where seriousness is the governing state of mind. My friend Robert Pogue Harrison put it this way in a recent conversation: "Wherever the real imposes itself, it tends to dissipate the fogs of irony."
Observe a 4-year-old child going through her daily life. You will not find the slightest bit of irony in her behavior. She has not, so to speak, taken on the veil of irony. She likes what she likes and declares it without dissimulation. She is not particularly conscious of the scrutiny of others. She does not hide behind indirect language. The most pure nonironic models in life, however, are to be found in nature: animals and plants are exempt from irony, which exists only where the human dwells.
What would it take to overcome the cultural pull of irony? Moving away from the ironic involves saying what you mean, meaning what you say and considering seriousness and forthrightness as expressive possibilities, despite the inherent risks. It means undertaking the cultivation of sincerity, humility and self-effacement, and demoting the frivolous and the kitschy on our collective scale of values. It might also consist of an honest self-inventory.
Here is a start: Look around your living space. Do you surround yourself with things you really like or things you like only because they are absurd? Listen to your own speech. Ask yourself: Do I communicate primarily through inside jokes and pop culture references? What percentage of my speech is meaningful? How much hyperbolic language do I use? Do I feign indifference? Look at your clothes. What parts of your wardrobe could be described as costume-like, derivative or reminiscent of some specific style archetype (the secretary, the hobo, the flapper, yourself as a child)? In other words, do your clothes refer to something else or only to themselves? Do you attempt to look intentionally nerdy, awkward or ugly? In other words, is your style an anti-style? The most important question: How would it feel to change yourself quietly, offline, without public display, from within?
Attempts to banish irony have come and gone in past decades. The loosely defined New Sincerity movements in the arts that have sprouted since the 1980s positioned themselves as responses to postmodern cynicism, detachment and meta-referentiality. (New Sincerity has recently been associated with the writing of David Foster Wallace, the films of Wes Anderson and the music of Cat Power.) But these attempts failed to stick, as evidenced by the new age of Deep Irony.
What will future generations make of this rampant sarcasm and unapologetic cultivation of silliness? Will we be satisfied to leave an archive filled with video clips of people doing stupid things? Is an ironic legacy even a legacy at all?
The ironic life is certainly a provisional answer to the problems of too much comfort, too much history and too many choices, but it is my firm conviction that this mode of living is not viable and conceals within it many social and political risks. For such a large segment of the population to forfeit its civic voice through the pattern of negation I've described is to siphon energy from the cultural reserves of the community at large. People may choose to continue hiding behind the ironic mantle, but this choice equals a surrender to commercial and political entities more than happy to act as parents for a self-infantilizing citizenry. So rather than scoffing at the hipster - a favorite hobby, especially of hipsters - determine whether the ashes of irony have settled on you as well. It takes little effort to dust them away.

HEADLINE: You Can't Say That on the Internet

BYLINE: By EVGENY MOROZOV. 
The author of the forthcoming book ''To Save Everything, Click Here: The Folly of Technological Solutionism.''

 BODY:
Cambridge, Mass.
A BASTION of openness and counterculture, Silicon Valley imagines itself as the un-Chick-fil-A. But its hyper-tolerant facade often masks deeply conservative, outdated norms that digital culture discreetly imposes on billions of technology users worldwide.
What is the vehicle for this new prudishness? Dour, one-dimensional algorithms, the mathematical constructs that automatically determine the limits of what is culturally acceptable.
Consider just a few recent kerfuffles. In early September, The New Yorker found its Facebook page blocked for violating the site's nudity and sex standards. Its offense: a cartoon of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. Eve's bared nipples failed Facebook's decency test.
That's right -- a venerable publication that still spells ''re-elect'' as ''relect'' is less puritan than a Californian start-up that wants to ''make the world more open.'' 
And fighting obscenity can be good for business. Impermium, a Silicon Valley company that helps Web sites deal with unwanted reader comments, has begun marketing technology that identifies ''all kinds of harmful content -- such as violence, racism, flagrant profanity, and hate speech -- and allows site owners to act on it in real-time, before it reaches readers.'' Impermium will police the readers -- but who will police Impermium?
Apple, too, has strayed from its iconoclastic roots. When Naomi Wolf's latest book, ''Vagina: A New Biography,'' went on sale in its iBooks store, Apple turned ''Vagina'' into ''V****a.'' After numerous complaints, Apple restored the title, but who knows how many other books are still affected?
True, these books are still on sale. Unlike the good old United States Post Office, which once confiscated ''Lady Chatterley's Lover'' and other books it deemed too lewd, Silicon Valley does not engage in direct censorship. What it does, though, is present ideas and terms that have gained public acceptance as something to be ashamed of. Silicon Valley doesn't just reflect social norms -- it actively shapes them in ways that are, for the most part, imperceptible.
The proliferation of the Autocomplete function on popular Web sites is a case in point. Nominally, all it does is complete your search query -- on YouTube, on Google, on Amazon -- before you've finished typing, using an algorithm to predict what you're most likely typing. A nifty feature -- but it, too, reinforces primness.
How so? Consider George Carlin's classic comedy routine ''Seven Words You Can Never Say on Television.'' See how many of those words would autocomplete on your favorite Web site. In my case, YouTube would autocomplete none. Amazon almost none (it also hates ''penis'' and ''vagina''). Of Carlin's seven words, Google would autocomplete only ''piss.''
Until recently, even the word ''bisexual'' wouldn't autocomplete at Google; it's only this past August that Google, after many complaints, began to autocomplete some, but not all, queries for that term. In 2010, the hacker magazine 2600 published a long blacklist of similar words. While I didn't verify all 400 of them on Google, a few that I did try -- like ''swastika'' and ''Lolita'' -- failed to autocomplete. Is Nabokov not trending in Mountain View? Alas, these algorithms are not particularly bright: unable to distinguish between Nabokov's novel and child pornography, they assume you want the latter.
Why won't tech companies let us freely use terms that already enjoy wide circulation and legitimacy? Do they fashion themselves as our new guardians? Are they too greedy to correct their algorithms' mistakes?
Thanks to Silicon Valley, our public life is undergoing a transformation. Accompanying this digital metamorphosis is the emergence of new, algorithmic gatekeepers, who, unlike the gatekeepers of the previous era -- journalists, publishers, editors -- don't flaunt their cultural authority. They may even be unaware of it themselves, eager to deploy algorithms for fun and profit.
Many of these gatekeepers remain invisible -- until something goes wrong. Thus, in early September, the online livestream from the Hugo Awards, the Oscars of the science fiction world, was interrupted with a cryptic copyright warning, right before the popular author Neil Gaiman was to deliver an acceptance speech.
Apparently, Ustream -- the site streaming the ceremony -- was using the services of another company to determine whether its streamed videos violated any copyrights. The partner company draws on a very large video archive to see, in real time, if what's being streamed matches anything in its collection. Somehow, the celebratory video that preceded Mr. Gaiman's speech tripped a copyright match, and the feed was cut off, even though the organizers had all the requisite permissions (and, under the doctrine of fair use, probably didn't need them anyway).
The limitations of algorithmic gatekeeping are on full display here. How do you teach the idea of ''fair use'' to an algorithm? Context matters, and there's no rule book here; that's why we have courts. From the perspective of sticky, amorphous human culture, semi-automation -- pairing up humans with algorithms -- beats full automation. Sometimes, gaps are productive. But will profit-driven Silicon Valley ever acknowledge this insight?
Our reputations are increasingly at the mercy of algorithms, too. No one knows this better than Bettina Wulff, the former German first lady who has sued Google for autocompleting searches for her name with words like ''escort'' and ''prostitute.'' Ms. Wulff insists that Google's algorithms spread false rumors about her; Google says that the suggested terms are just an ''algorithmically generated result of objective factors, including the popularity of the entered search terms.''
Google's defense would sound tenable if its own algorithms weren't so easy to trick. In 2010, the marketing expert Brent Payne paid an army of assistants to search for ''Brent Payne manipulated this.'' Soon anyone typing ''Brent P'' into Google would see that phrase in their autocomplete suggestions. After Mr. Payne publicized his experiment, Google removed that particular suggestion, but how many similar cases have gone undetected? What is ''objective'' about such algorithmic ''truths''?
Quaint prudishness, excessive enforcement of copyright, unneeded damage to our reputations: algorithmic gatekeeping is exacting a high toll on our public life. Instead of treating algorithms as a natural, objective reflection of reality, we must take them apart and closely examine each line of code.
Can we do it without hurting Silicon Valley's business model? The world of finance, facing a similar problem, offers a clue. After several disasters caused by algorithmic trading earlier this year, authorities in Hong Kong and Australia drafted proposals to establish regular independent audits of the design, development and modifications of computer systems used in such trades. Why couldn't auditors do the same to Google?
Silicon Valley wouldn't have to disclose its proprietary algorithms, only share them with the auditors. A drastic measure? Perhaps. But it's one that is proportional to the growing clout technology companies have in reshaping not only our economy but also our culture.
Obviously, Silicon Valley won't develop or embrace similar norms overnight. However, instead of accepting this new reality as a fait accompli, we must ensure that, in pursuing greater profits, our new algorithmic gatekeepers are forced to accept the idea that their culture-defining function comes with great responsibility.

HEADLINE: Sideshow Has Center Stage in Sprint Cup Finale

BYLINE: By VIV BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
Jeff Gordon is not going to race for a championship on Sunday when the Nascar Sprint Cup season finale is held at Homestead-Miami Speedway. But he will surely be in the middle of a chase that could end in spectacular fashion if Clint Bowyer's No. 15 Toyota is anywhere near the rear bumper of Gordon's No. 24 Chevrolet.
Payback, coming after Gordon crashed into Bowyer last week at Phoenix International Raceway to touch off a pit-clearing brawl, is perhaps the best drama left to play out in Nascar this season, with the Cup leader Brad Keselowski owning a seemingly comfortable 20-point advantage over his only challenger for the title, the five-time series champion Jimmie Johnson. 
Nascar could use a good show in the final race of a playoff that has seen double-digit drops in television ratings at times.
''I think you'll have a pretty healthy segment of the audience tuning into see what's happening with those two,'' Nascar's vice president for broadcasting, Steve Herbst, said of the impending showdown between Gordon and Bowyer.
Coming off last year's riveting battle between the fan favorites Tony Stewart and Carl Edwards that was not settled until the final laps at Homestead, ratings are down in six of the nine races in the playoff so far this year. It is not a small drop in some cases. The race in Martinsville, Va., on Oct. 28 was off by 22 percent from last year. In Loudon, N.H., on Sept. 23, ratings were down 17 percent. The Fort Worth race on Nov. 4 was off 15 percent.
''I think it's tough to have increases year after year after year, and our sport was the only sport that did it all throughout the '90s and almost through the first years in the 2000s,'' said Eddie Gossage, the Texas Motor Speedway president. ''We had an unparalleled amount of growth, and at some point, it has to level out. Then you have the economy and then you have the proliferation of cable channels on television, and all of us are having to deal with that.''
Gossage, known for his sometimes grandiose promotions, came up with a ''Wild Asphalt Circus'' theme to draw interest to his race. But Nascar did not get really wild until a week later at Phoenix, where Gordon deliberately wrecked Bowyer in the closing laps in response to a series of confrontations between the two this season. Bowyer, who was on the edge of contention for the Cup title, was knocked out of the race.
Gordon avoided being KO'd moments later when Bowyer's crew went after him and a melee ensued -- a sudden flashback to Nascar's good old, bad old days.
''The sport was made on fights,'' Kevin Harvick said after winning at Phoenix. ''We should have more fights. I like fights.''
So do some fans, who will not be robbed of that potential at Homestead. Although there were calls by some drivers and members of the news media for Nascar to suspend Gordon, he was fined $100,000 and put on probation instead.
That works out well for Nascar and its sister company International Speedway Corporation, which owns Homestead-Miami Speedway, although a Nascar spokesman said the decision to allow Gordon to race had nothing to do with the entertainment value of a rematch with Bowyer.
Still, speedway officials played up the potential showdown on their Web site. They know what can draw a crowd in Nascar.
Asked if he thought the issue with Bowyer was over, Gordon said on Friday, ''Oh, there's the million-dollar question.''
He added: ''You know, every situation is unique, and I can't control what's going to happen out there or what other guys are going to do against me this weekend. I'm going to focus on what I can do, and if; I'm pretty sure if they're having a good day, they're not going to mess with me. If they're having a really bad day and feel like they have nothing to lose, then maybe they will.''
In the meantime, Johnson is trying to inject some drama of his own into the finale, pointing out the pressure that will be on Keselowski.
''This garage area is tough, the weight of this race, I don't care who you are, it'll show up at some point in time and thoughts will run through your head, and with all that being said, a 15th-place finish is not a layup for these guys,'' Johnson said on Thursday.
Keselowski, who struggled for years to gain a top ride before finally making it to Penske Racing in 2010, said he was not going to be rattled. If he finishes 15th or better, he will take the title no matter where Johnson places.
''There's pressure applied and pressure felt,'' Keselowski said. ''Certainly, he's trying to apply pressure. Certainly, I don't feel any.''
If he wins, it will also be the first Cup championship for the team owner Roger Penske, best known for his dominance in the open-wheel IndyCar Series and 15 Indianapolis 500 titles.
Johnson said he still thought there might be some drama left in the Chase.
''For whatever reason, I'm at peace with my situation,'' Johnson said. ''I mean, I don't want to be in this situation, but I am strangely optimistic, and I can't explain why. There's just feelings that people have, and I'll see if this feeling comes true Sunday evening.''
Maybe there will be more to this race than Gordon versus Bowyer, after all.

HEADLINE: Courting the Gas Industry, With an Eye on the Future

BYLINE: By JOHN SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
WILLIAMSPORT, Pa. -- The flames started slowly, emerging from the top of oil field equipment, and then quickly grew to a roar.
This was not an emergency, though it looked like one. It was a ''burn exercise'' for safety workers in the oil and gas industry, part of a new course at the Pennsylvania College of Technology.
A gas boom has brought companies and workers into parts of Pennsylvania that lie atop the Marcellus Shale formation, a rich source of both natural gas and controversy. The common economic criticism of the drilling industry is that it booms and then busts, generating few local jobs and leaving little lasting economic benefit.
But Lycoming County, in the north-central part of the state, is trying to change that. 
The county and its main city, Williamsport, are working diligently to position themselves not just as a host to the arriving companies, but also as a source of local workers for the industry and a long-term beneficiary of its local and national expansion.
The industry helped give the Williamsport metropolitan area the seventh-fastest-growing economy in the United States in 2010, according to figures released last year by the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis. Four new hotels have been built in town, and restaurants and bars have sprouted, including a barbecue place to meet the carnivorous needs of homesick Texans and Oklahomans.
''We're wrapping our arms around the industry,'' said Williamsport's mayor, Gabe Campana. ''Drill, baby, drill!''
County officials, to help deal with the impact of the boom, examined the early effects on housing, roads, social services, and water and sewage infrastructure.
The college, part of the Pennsylvania State University system, increased efforts to train local workers, educating 7,000 students in short courses since 2009 and expanding two- and four-year degree programs as well. The initiative is part of its work with a consortium of colleges called ShaleNET, financed with a $15 million federal grant.
Thanks to such initiatives, said Kurt Hausammann, the county's director of planning, ''we are seeing more of our own Pennsylvania youth and young professionals getting into the gas industry now.''
Local businesses have also stepped up to work with the industry. The Ralph S. Alberts Company makes custom molded polymers, anything from seats for amusement park rides to medical training mannequins. ''We really have been able to adapt and almost continually change our identity to keep up with whatever new technology is coming around,'' said Edward Alberts, the company's president.
When the drillers came to town, the company quickly found a way to apply its expertise to the industry's needs, opening a business that constructs containment pens for drilling and storage equipment that are lined with heavy-duty spray-on polymer so that any spills do not contaminate the soil. The company is building the enclosures in Pennsylvania and Ohio, and drillers are talking to it about taking on jobs in Texas.
Despite the opportunities, the jobs do not suit everyone, said Westley Smith, who was raised in nearby Mifflinburg and designs critical welding processes for pipelines. Many people in the industry work six days a week, 10 hours a day, he said, and ''a lot of people around here don't typically want to do that.''
Tracy L. Brundage, Penn College's assistant vice president for work-force and economic development, said training courses often started with an information session attended by 200 people. The instructor begins with the ''work ethic components'' of these jobs, including the long hours and the requirement that workers be physically fit and drug free. ''By break time,'' she said, ''half of the room is gone.''
Evan DiCiolli, a 24-year-old Californian working on gas wells near town, said that while local residents might object to the inconveniences associated with the drilling boom, ''this is calm'' compared with the year he spent in North Dakota. Stores there were unable to keep the shelves stocked, he said, and men slept in their cars because hotel rooms and apartments could not be had.
Mr. DiCiolli, who was enjoying a rare night off at Bullfrog Brewery, a restaurant downtown, added of those who disapprove of the drilling going on around them: ''Don't frown on the things people do to get natural resources out of the ground when you're using the resources.''
Environmentalists contend that state and local governments have grossly overstated the economic benefits while playing down the environmental risks of shale drilling.
Anne and Eric Nordell started their organic farm in Trout Run, 25 miles from Williamsport, in the 1980s. From the highest point on their 90 acres, one can see drilling rigs and platforms on the surrounding hills, as well as deforestation that makes way for the drilling platforms and the roads to get to them. ''We're just praying that our water will be safe,'' Ms. Nordell said.
''The first indication that we have any type of contamination, we will shut down,'' she added. ''I eat the food that I grow, and I will not sell anything that's unsafe.''
Ralph Kisberg, the president of the Responsible Drilling Alliance, an environmental group, said he was not trying to block the gas boom. ''We know it can't be stopped,'' he said. But, he added, the state should benefit more from the removal of its resources.
A new state law, Act 13, includes fees for the industry that generated about $200 million in revenue in its first year, but that amount is expected to drop off quickly. Mr. Kisberg said the state could receive far more money over time through a direct tax on the gas itself.
Mark Price, a labor economist at the liberal-leaning Keystone Research Center in Harrisburg, estimated that the industry had generated 20,000 jobs in Pennsylvania since the first quarter of 2008. While ''any job over that time period is one to be lauded,'' he said, the total constituted less than half a percentage point of all employment in the state.
(The Marcellus Shale Coalition, an industry group, argues that if all jobs tied to shale gas are counted, the number rises to 234,000.)
Mr. Price said he was skeptical that Pennsylvania could buffer the cycle of boom and bust, one the state had seen before with timber and coal. The area has already had a taste of what a bust might be like; natural gas prices have dropped in the past year, and drilling has slowed.
''You would think that there would be a sensitivity to this issue,'' Mr. Price said. ''But memories are short.''

HEADLINE: Even With a 'Light Footprint,' It's Hard to Sidestep the Middle East

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

 BODY:
The eruptions in the Middle East have posed perhaps the severest, most direct test yet of the limits of President Obama's signature foreign policy innovation during his first term, what the White House hails as the ''light footprint'' strategy.
Sensitive to public sentiment that a decade of war had debilitated America, and eager to focus on economic problems at home, President Obama quickly embraced a mix of remote-control technology and at-a-distance diplomacy to contain the most explosive problems in the Middle East, South Asia and Africa. Strikes by unmanned drone aircraft increased sixfold, secret cyberweapons were aimed at Iran, and special forces killed the world's most-wanted terrorist and made night raids the currency of American force.
For a while it worked. As Mr. Obama's newly fallen director of central intelligence, David H. Petraeus, asked so succinctly a year ago, ''Who wouldn't want a light-footprint strategy?'' 
But implicit in Mr. Petraeus's arch question was the recognition that the strategy has limited utility. And now Mr. Obama is under more pressure than ever to become engaged in the Middle East in a way that he avoided during the presidential campaign. In his own party, there are rumblings that he should intervene more directly to halt the slaughter in Syria -- by placing Patriot missiles around the region to take down President Bashar al-Assad's air power -- and to renew efforts in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process as soon as the current missile barrages can be contained.
Overarching all those problems is the question of Iran, which has fueled the Syrian conflict in part to show that it will not sit idly while sanctions eat away at its oil revenue. Mr. Obama has already declared that he wants to start direct negotiations with Iran -- but it is a last-ditch effort, his own aides acknowledge, to avert a military confrontation that they fear could come by the middle of 2013.
Mr. Obama had hoped not to be preoccupied with these crises in the last weeks of his first term. The hope four years ago was that by now he would be reaping the peace dividends of extracting America from Iraq and withdrawing from Afghanistan, even if the mission was far from complete, so he could turn to what during the campaign he frequently characterized as ''some nation-building at home.''
Since 2009, Mr. Obama has tried to avoid getting sucked into the vortex of Middle Eastern conflict and dysfunction that drained so many of his predecessors. It was a deliberate choice from the start, his aides say. Fresh to the presidency, he asked his national security staff to reassess where America was overinvested and underinvested around the world.
The answer, his national security adviser, Thomas E. Donilon, recalled last week, came back quickly: ''We were overweighted in some regions, such as our military commitments in the Middle East,'' and underweighted in regions where America's future prosperity lay, notably elsewhere in Asia.
That helps explain why Mr. Obama is moving ahead this weekend with a trip to Thailand, Myanmar and Cambodia rather than burying himself in the Situation Room in a running conference call with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and President Mohamed Morsi of Egypt, whom Mr. Obama is leaning on to contain the militant Palestinian party Hamas and stop the predictable escalation of missile attacks.
''We never considered scrapping the trip,'' one of Mr. Obama's top aides said on Friday. ''It's the difference between keeping focused on what's important in the long term and the urgent crisis du jour, which will always be there.''
To Mr. Obama's critics, the root of the seeming absence of American leverage in the Middle East today is a light footprint that was simply too light.
''I think the way to understand Obama's approach -- I wouldn't call it a strategy -- is that he has a uniform preference to keep most problems at a distance,'' said Eliot A. Cohen, a professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies who worked for Mitt Romney's presidential campaign and helped develop Mr. Romney's critique of Mr. Obama's approach. ''That is what the light footprint has been all about. And it's run out of gas.''
Libya has become Exhibit 1 in that argument. Mr. Obama reluctantly committed air power to the ouster of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi over the objections of the secretary of defense at the time, Robert M. Gates, who warned that there was no direct American interest in the outcome. Instead, the president urged the Arab League and NATO to ''put skin in the game.''
They did, but Mr. Obama's reluctance to put American forces on the ground during the fight, and his decision to keep America's diplomatic and C.I.A. presence minimal in post-Qaddafi Libya, may have helped lead the United States to miss signals and get caught unaware in the attack on the American mission in Benghazi. Military forces were too far from Libya's shores during the Sept. 11 attack to intervene.
At the end of the current investigations, that fact, more than any other, seems most likely to emerge as the answer to the question of why so little firepower was available to protect the ambassador and other Americans after they came under attack.
Syria has already become the next argument over the utility of the light footprint. Mr. Obama long resisted getting involved in that conflict even from the air, as he did in Libya. The international community was too disorganized; there was no NATO or Arab League effort; and the Russians and the Chinese blocked effective action at the United Nations.
Also, with the election looming, Mr. Obama had no interest in immersing America in a new war just as he was exiting two others. ''We're not going to do a damn thing until the election is over,'' one of his senior diplomats fumed in the summer.
But with about 40,000 dead as a result of the conflict in Syria, the pressure on Mr. Obama is building, even from some Democrats. A proposal is circulating to put Patriot missile batteries in Turkey and Jordan, capable of shooting down Mr. Assad's airplanes as they attack rebel strongholds.
''It's not a fair fight,'' Senator Mark Udall, a Colorado Democrat, said on Saturday at the Halifax International Security Forum in Nova Scotia. ''The election is over, and while I'm not endorsing a no-fly zone today, we can't stand idly by'' and risk having the rest of the region inflamed.
Senator John McCain of Arizona, who ran against Mr. Obama in 2008 and has been among the most vocal advocates of greater intervention, argues that ''every bad thing that we predicted would happen if we intervened -- instability in Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey -- is already happening anyway.''
There seems to be no chance of an American ground intervention; even Mr. McCain, the Senate's strongest hawk, stops short of advocating that. But Mr. Obama's own aides acknowledge that his hope that he could hold back and let those with more direct interests take the lead has been dashed. The light footprint of the future may not be so light.

HEADLINE: An Olympic Effort Under Construction

BYLINE: By JASON STALLMAN

 BODY:
Sochi, a Black Sea resort city in the southwest corner of Russia, is preparing for the Olympics in February 2014, when it will become the first subtropical city to host the Winter Games. Dmitry Chernyshenko has returned to his hometown as the president and chief executive of the Sochi 2014 organizing committee.
Citrus and palm trees will provide a backdrop to the indoor ice sports arenas for figure skating and hockey. Outdoor competitions like skiing and luge will be held about 30 miles north, high in the Caucasus Mountains. 
Seemingly the entire region is under construction, with 60,000 laborers and 3,000 heavy trucks -- many running 24 hours a day -- working to convert a little-known area next to the Georgia border into a stage befitting the Olympics. Chernyshenko, 44, is the face of it all. JASON STALLMAN
Q. Will everything be done in time?
A. All Olympics-related infrastructure should be done two seasons prior to the Games. So we are already beginning test events at the venues. Which, by the way, is killing rumors that we're trying to hide our venues. We're telling everyone, please, come see our venues.
The environment now looks like a big construction site. Major construction works at the Olympic sites will be ceased after July 2013. However, we will continue the process of fine-tuning, like landscaping. At the same time, all construction works in the city should be put on halt till after the Games. I mean, for instance, the construction of hotels or other facilities not related to the Games.
Q. What has been the most difficult aspect of planning the Olympics?
A. The project is delivered by people. The challenge is personnel. Owing to the Games, the unemployment in the region is practically nonexistent. On the other side, it means we need to search other labor markets for personnel. We have to attract specialists from all around the country, and volunteers. I'm talking about Games makers, those who will organize the Games. We're using two companies, both in the United States, to help -- Adecco and Kelly -- to help find personnel. They've built subsidiary offices all over the country. We have to find, select, hire, train and accommodate. So it's very difficult.
Q. What will the total cost be for the Games?
A. It is important to understand that there are two separate, clearly outlined budgets to consider. As C.E.O. of Sochi 2014 organizing committee, I am responsible for the budget for the staging of the Sochi 2014 Olympic and Paralympic Games. The budget for staging the Games amounts to $1.8 billion and is financed from the Sochi 2014 organizing committee marketing program and guaranteed state funding. Taking into consideration the exchange rate and inflation, it corresponds approximately to the budgets of previous Games.
The projected budget for the construction of Olympic facilities and related infrastructure is 185 billion rubles ($5.9 billion), approximately half of which is coming from private investors. However, you should keep in mind these budgets do not include the programs on renovation of the region that are not directly linked to the Games.
Q. There was huge demand for tickets to all events at the London Games. What are your expectations for ticket sales?
A. I have no doubt that the Games in Sochi will be sold out.
Q. If you had to pick one event to attend at the Sochi Games, what would it be?
A. Ice hockey final. The U.S. team is in it. Russia wins, 5-3.
Q. How about up on the mountain?
A. On the mountain, I would come to biathlon. That's the most popular sport in our country.

HEADLINE: New Hope on Immigration

 BODY:
Funny how quickly some principles collapse when given the right kind of shove. One day, the Republican Party is rock-ribbed restrictionist, dedicated to the proposition that unauthorized immigrants are an invading army of job stealers, welfare moochers and criminals whose only acceptable destiny is to be caught and deported -- the border fence forever, ''amnesty'' never. The next day: never mind. The party suddenly discovers the merits of a working immigration system. Senators like John McCain and Lindsey Graham, who once bravely supported bipartisan reform but slunk away late in the last Bush administration, are scratching at the door again, as if the last five years never happened.
All it took was an election in which millions of Latino voters -- many of them the wives and husbands, sons, daughters, grandchildren, cousins, co-workers and friends of those despised ''illegals'' -- overwhelmingly chose President Obama over the man who promised to be deporter in chief. They rejected Mitt Romney by 3 to 1, according to exit polls. Asian-Americans did, too. Republicans looked at a changing America, saw a future of decline and irrelevance for the party, and concluded that immigrants weren't so bad after all. 
This poses an opportunity and a challenge for Mr. Obama, who promised to tackle immigration reform in his first term and did not, and is firmly on the hook to do so now. He says he will push reform early, and he looks well positioned to get something done. His allies in Congress need to step up and help.
There is a long way to go before an immigration deal is struck, but the president and Congress can draw its outlines clearly, starting now. Any worthwhile reform must give 11 million undocumented immigrants a way to live within the law as American citizens. Mr. Obama's stopgap move to protect young immigrants and students from deportation by a regulation similar to the Dream Act was sensible and necessary. But these Americans-in-fact deserve the chance to be Americans on paper, too. So do their parents, and whoever else in the 11 million wishes to journey from ''them'' to ''us.'' Republicans are floating schemes for temporary legal status for workers without a clear path to citizenship. Mr. Obama should make clear that basic equality demands more than that.
Meanwhile, he should be reforming the way his administration is carrying out current law -- starting with scaling back its arbitrary, self-imposed quota of 400,000 deportations a year. There is enforcement work to be done, like finding more effective ways to stifle illegal employment, but any strategy that fixates on deportations and the border is foolish and ineffective. Illegal border crossings and arrests at the border have fallen to the lowest levels in decades. The unauthorized immigrants whom hard-liners want to keep out are already in the country. They are the workers and families Mr. Obama says he wants to integrate and assimilate, even as his policies break those families apart. Mr. Obama's own Department of Homeland Security is a huge part of the problem, with its dangerous and widening use of state and local police officers as surrogate immigration enforcement agents. Its Secure Communities program has led to mass deportations of minor offenders and even people with no criminal records.
The country needs a new approach to immigration enforcement, one that stops enlisting the local police in its dragnet. The Obama administration should keep fighting efforts by states like Arizona and Alabama to set up their own immigration laws to abuse and deport the undocumented. And it should support states like Illinois and New York, which have been trying to reassert the proper separation between local police officers and federal immigration agents.
There will be challenges, of course. The hard-liners against reform -- including the white-culture alarmists and the closet racists -- have not gone away. But the election did scare some of the immigration opportunists back onto the bipartisan bus.
Mr. Obama gained much when he allowed students who could benefit from the Dream Act a reprieve. Now he needs to think bigger and better, and look to the large constituency behind reform -- student activists, business groups, farmers, labor unions, Catholic bishops, evangelical churches, African-Americans, civil-liberties organizations and regular American citizens who support legalization -- to press the case. The arguments for reform over expulsion have always been smarter, saner and better for the rule of law, the preservation of families and the economy. Now that some of their opponents are softening their positions, Mr. Obama and Congress need to act.

HEADLINE: The Next Round of Derivatives Regulation

 BODY:
In the weeks ahead, federal regulators will finalize rules that, done right, will bring long-overdue transparency and oversight to the multitrillion-dollar derivatives market. The big banks that control derivatives trading, however, are lobbying to dilute the rules. To grasp what is at stake, recall that the $182 billion taxpayer bailout of American International Group during the financial crisis was essentially a bailout of the global financial system, undertaken to make good on derivatives bets gone spectacularly wrong. 
Since then, financial regulators in the United States, particularly at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, have put several rules in effect under the Dodd-Frank financial reform law to rein in derivatives. But a pair of reforms now before the C.F.T.C. are arguably the most important of all.
One would require that most derivatives be traded on open electronic platforms, with prices visible to all participants before deals were done. That would curtail the practice of trading derivatives as private bilateral contracts, which would help to prevent destabilizing risks from building up without regulatory oversight. Banks object to this rule because transparent trading will invariably lead to lower prices for derivatives and lower profits for banks. They want broad exceptions to the rules, especially for large trades, which they say will disrupt markets if done openly. But that problem could be managed with a narrow exemption. To protect the public, regulators must ensure that the new rule will require the vast majority of trades -- more than 90 percent -- to be conducted openly.
Another reform would ensure that new derivatives rules apply to trades made through the foreign branches, affiliates or subsidiaries of American banks. That is crucial, because in a global economy, risk knows no borders. Banks, however, want ''substituted compliance,'' in which foreign affiliates are regulated by the foreign country as long as that country has similar rules.
The trouble is, derivatives rules are weaker or nonexistent elsewhere, making the call for substituted compliance either a tactic to delay enforcement until the rest of the world updates its regulations or, worse, an attempt to avoid tough regulation altogether. The new rules, which are expected to take effect in January, could be delayed for six months to allow European and other international regulators to enact reforms that meet American standards. But even then, American regulators must be required to stringently verify that foreign rules and enforcement are truly comparable to standards in the United States. Otherwise, substituted compliance would be nothing more than disguised deregulation, and American taxpayers would remain exposed to future bailouts.

HEADLINE: By the Book: P. J. O'Rourke

 BODY:
The author of ''Holidays in Heck'' and ''Parliament of Whores'' doesn't like to read books about current affairs: ''I can write that junk myself.''
What book is on your night stand now?
''Kearny's March,'' by Winston Groom. The author of ''Forrest Gump'' has become a wonderful military historian and tells us how, as a result of the Mexican War, we acquired not just Texas but New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, Utah, Nevada and -- every silver lining has its cloud -- California.
When and where do you like to read?
Every evening by my living room fireplace in a splendid Eames chair, giving thanks to my bad back for excusing this extravagant purchase. 
What was the last truly great book you read? Do you remember the last time you said to someone, ''You absolutely must read this book''?
''Jane Eyre,'' last week. I hadn't read it in 45 years. If then. (I suspect CliffsNotes were involved.) I didn't even remember who was locked in the attic. I told my wife she had to read it. She'd just done so (which I didn't remember either) and gave me a look that conveyed Charlotte Bront's message to all men: The secret of a happy marriage is to have a burning house fall on you.
Do you consider yourself a fiction or nonfiction person? What's your favorite genre? Any guilty pleasures?
I like fiction and the kind of history that gives the grace and flavor of fiction to the past. No bloviation on current events, please. I can write that junk myself. My favorite genre is the comedy of manners, where Christopher Buckley reigns. My guilty pleasures are the usual -- crime and suspense. But my literary conscience doesn't bother me about Ruth Rendell, P.[#x20ac][0/00]D. James, Elmore Leonard and Alan Furst.
What book had the greatest impact on you? What book made you want to write?
Friedrich Hayek's ''The Road to Serfdom'' gave cogent shape to a slew of inchoate feelings. No particular book made me want to write. I like to make things but, being clumsy with my hands and glib with my tongue, words are my raw material.
If you could require the president to read one book, what would it be?
''The Road to Serfdom,'' no matter who is president. But a president is a busy man, and Hayek's syntax is heavy going. Being a native German-speaker, Hayek strings together railroad sentences ending in train wreck verbs. For an easier read about the connection between economic and personal liberty, I suggest Milton and Rose Friedman's ''Free to Choose.''
What are your reading habits? Paper or electronic? Do you take notes? Do you snack while you read?
Behold the book with its brilliant, nonlinear search engine called flipping-through-the-pages. A Kindle returns us to the inconvenience of the scroll except with batteries and electronic glitches. It's as handy as bringing Homer along to recite the ''Iliad'' while playing a lyre. I dog-ear all my books, underline passages and scribble ''Huh?'' and ''How true!'' in the margins. The only fit snack while reading is the olive in a martini.
Do you prefer a book that makes you laugh or makes you cry? One that teaches you something or one that distracts you?
A good book does all four. Three out of four isn't bad. Two is acceptable, except for books that make you cry and teach you something, which are to be avoided at all costs.
What were your favorite books as a child? Do you have a favorite character or hero from one of those books? Is there one book you wish all children would read?
I didn't care much for children's literature. I liked to read at random in the World Book Encyclopedia. My favorite character was Julius Caesar. His leadership style was refreshingly different from my grade school principal's. I wish children would read Emily Post's original ''Etiquette,'' in which Mrs. Post says -- in so many words -- ''Pull your pants up, turn your hat around and get a job.''
Disappointing, overrated, just not so good: What book did you feel as if you were supposed to like, and didn't? Do you remember the last book you put down without finishing?
Ian McEwan's ''Saturday'' -- I quit just when the plot reached its crisis. I didn't care what happened to any of the characters. (On a related note, I was reading the Harry Potter series to my 10-year-old daughter, and she made me stop in the middle of the last volume. ''Too much teenage mush,'' she said. I said, ''Don't you want to know if Lord Voldemort wins?'' And she said, ''Oh, come on, all those books and you think Harry Potter is going to die at the end?'')
What's the worst book about politics you've ever read?
''Economics,'' by Paul Samuelson and William Nordhaus, the standard textbook on the subject for my generation. Although not supposedly about politics, it contains as much bad political thinking as can be packed into a decent liberal democratic framework. (I'm not counting ''Das Kapital,'' which I consider a comedy of manners, or ''Mein Kampf,'' the worst book I've ever read, period.)
Which of the books you've written is your favorite?
''Parliament of Whores,'' published 20 years ago and subtitled ''A Lone Humorist Attempts to Explain the Entire U.S. Government.'' I'll never get such a large, slow-moving target in my sights again.
If somebody walked in on you writing one of your books, what would they see? What does your workplace look like?
A mess -- books, notes, clippings piled everywhere, an IBM Selectric for first drafts, a computer for second drafts, pencils and legal pads for really difficult passages and me in the middle of it, doing nothing. My (very prolific) friend, the late John Hughes, said, ''The hardest thing about being a writer is convincing your wife that lying on the sofa is work.''
Do you remember the last book someone personally recommended you read that you enjoyed? Who recommended it and what convinced you to pick it up?
Fifty-odd years ago my Sunday School teacher said I should read the Bible. It was 30 years before I got around to it. The King James version should be read by everyone who loves language or, for that matter, God. Divine intervention aside, I don't listen to many [#x20ac]recommendations.
Is there a book you wish you could write, but feel you can't or never will?
I have a lovely mess of an Irish/English-American family. There's a mash-up of ''Studs Lonigan'' and ''The Old Wives' Tale'' in there somewhere. But I'm a reporter, not a novelist. I'm reasonably alert to what people do. Why eludes me.
What's the book you wish someone else would write?
A definitive history of bohemianism, that ever-present undercurrent of antinomian thought and behavior wearing funny clothes. It should start with Petronius and his Satyricon hipsters. And I'll bet ancient China and Pharaonic Egypt had beatniks too.
Which do you prefer, traveling or reading travel books?
Having recently written a travel book and just returned from taking the kids to Disney World, I loathe them both.

ON SAUDI ARABIAIts People, Past, Religion, Fault Lines -- and Future
By Karen Elliott HouseIllustrated. 308 pp. Alfred A. Knopf. $28.95.
In Peter Berg's whodunit ''The Kingdom,'' a young F.B.I. agent boarding a plane to Riyadh asks a seasoned colleague what Saudi Arabia is like. ''A bit like Mars,'' replies the more experienced man.
It's not Mars, exactly, but for most Americans Saudi Arabia is probably more like another world than any other inhabited part of this one. It is about as distinct from the freewheeling United States as a country can be -- not a modern totalitarian ''republic'' like Communist North Korea, but another kind of dictatorial regime, a fanatically conservative society self-oppressed by thousand-year-old rules, regulations, prescriptions and prohibitions. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is, as Christopher Hitchens once described the occluded realm ruled by the Kim family in Pyongyang, a place ''where everything that is not absolutely compulsory is absolutely forbidden.'' 
The Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Karen Elliott House has been visiting the kingdom for more than 30 years, and in her new book, ''On Saudi Arabia: Its People, Past, Religion, Fault Lines -- and Future,'' she skillfully unveils this inscrutable place for regional specialists and general readers alike. ''For millennia,'' she writes, ''Saudis struggled to survive in a vast desert under searing sun and shearing winds that quickly devour a man's energy, as he searches for a wadi of shade trees and water, which are few and far between, living on only a few dates and camel's milk. These conditions bred a people suspicious of each other and especially of strangers, a culture largely devoid of art or enjoyment of beauty.''
Religious edicts are crushingly enforced by state, mosque and society. Movie theaters are banned, as are concerts and just about everything else related to entertainment. Women, even foreign women, must cover themselves in public. Unrelated women and men aren't allowed to mix anywhere. Even Starbucks coffee shops are segregated by gender.
Men have it rough, but women have it much rougher. According to Wahhabi Islam, men must obey Allah and women must obey men. ''Fortunately for men,'' House writes, ''Allah is distant, but unfortunately for women, men are omnipresent.''
Western women like House, though, have an advantage, despite the fact that they're forced by the Muttawah, the religious police, to cover themselves. In Saudi Arabia they are treated as ''honorary men,'' so House was able to interview whomever she liked -- men and their wives, women and their husbands -- something no foreign man or Saudi citizen of either gender is ever allowed to do.
She describes the society as a maze ''in which Saudis endlessly maneuver through winding paths between high walls of religious rules, government restrictions and cultural traditions.'' The labyrinth is not just a metaphor. Cities are claustrophobic places where even men but especially women live as shut-ins, socializing strictly with family. Walk down a residential street and in every direction you'll see not porches and yards but walls ''that block people from outside view but, more important, separate them from one another.''
And the country as a whole is riven with virtual walls. The sterile interior highlands of the Nejd are at odds with the relatively cosmopolitan Hejaz on the coast of the Red Sea. In the Eastern Province, where the country's oil reserves are concentrated, Shia Muslims live under the boot, denounced by Wahhabis as heretics. The Ismailis in the destitute south, with their historic links to Yemen, are not-so-benignly neglected. Each of these regions in turn is divided by tribe, and each tribe is divided by family. Most Saudis marry one of their cousins. Hardly any of them marry outside their tribe, let alone region.
But the highest wall of all -- the information barrier restricting knowledge of the wider world and its ways -- is crumbling fast. Thanks to the Internet, the young (and 60 percent of Saudis are 20 or younger) know all about life in less cloistered Arab societies and in the West. And they're not buying into the Saudi system the way their parents and grandparents did.
''Our minds are in a box,'' a middle-aged businessman explains to House. ''But the young are being set free by the Internet and knowledge. They will not tolerate what we have.'' A single man in his 20s tells her: ''Facebook opens the doors of our cages.'' And a university official says: ''A young man has a car and money in his pocket, but what can he do? Nothing. He looks at TV and sees others doing things he can't do and wonders why.''
Even if their elders, the government and the religious establishment ease up and give young people a little additional space, there's a more serious problem that won't be so easily solved. What on earth will Saudi Arabia do when the wells run dry, when oil can no longer pay for the lavish welfare system that provides subsidized goods and free services to the middle class?
Millions of new jobs will need to be created in the coming years just to keep the economy from collapsing. Yet the education system, in the firm grip of Wahhabi fundamentalists, is spectacularly unable to prepare Saudis for professional jobs. And since most refuse blue-collar and service work, 9 out of 10 private sector jobs are held by foreigners.
The entire country, as House so clearly shows, needs a radical overhaul. But where is it going to come from? Not from the cautious and self-interested government, at least not with the current royal cohort in charge.
The Saudi state is an absolute monarchy, but it has a quirk of its own. Sons of the state's founder, Abdul Aziz bin Saud, who fathered 44 boys, have been ruling the kingdom since his death in 1953. The throne keeps passing from brother to brother instead of from father to son. But the number of brothers is running out. The current king, Abdullah, is in his late 80s. Until this year, the next in line was Crown Prince Nayef, but he died in June, at the age of 78. The youngest brother is in his 60s. At some point, possibly soon, someone from the next generation will take charge.
House repeatedly -- and convincingly -- compares the Saudi regime to the Soviet Union in its final days when Ronald Reagan said of the various premiers before Mikhail Gorbachev, ''They keep dying on me.'' The country's calcified government, its sullen populace, its youth bulge, its outdated religious requirements and prohibitions, the collapse of the information bubble and the dying off of the current line of geriatric rulers are all bound to coalesce into a perfect storm sooner or later.
But we should not expect liberalism, not now, not in this place. ''For all their frustrations,'' House writes, ''most Saudis do not crave democracy. . . . What unites conservatives and modernizers, and young and old, is a hunger not for freedom but for justice; for genuine rule of law, not rule by royal whim.''
Justice and the rule of law aren't at all likely to develop in a system that is not democratic. If House is right, then whatever happens, a new or post-Saudi Arabia may end up like post-Soviet Russia, at least in one way. A spring-like revolution for freedom, where human rights, justice, and the rule of law replace toppled labyrinth walls, will be a dream deferred to generations unborn.

HEADLINE: Sunday Dialogue: New Tack for the G.O.P.?

 BODY:
After its election loss, some urge a more moderate course.
To the Editor:
Now that Republicans have lost the presidential election and the party's leaders have failed to achieve their stated priority, to make Barack Obama a one-term president, debate has begun over the reasons for their failure and over the party's future. This failure seems partly due to the party's inability to cultivate credible or inspiring leaders and its commitment to tax policies that benefit mainly the rich at the expense of social services that most Americans support.
The most basic hurdle for the Republicans, though, is arithmetical: 39 percent of the voting population leans Republican, according to the Pew Research Center, while 50 percent leans Democratic. Republicans can try to make up their 11-point gap by appealing to those who identify with neither party. But a party deriving much of its support from rural and blue-collar whites and upper-income people will lose national elections in the future because these groups are shrinking relative to groups that tend to support Democrats.
Given their numerical disadvantages, it takes no leap of logic to understand why Republicans would see suppressing voting by groups that lean Democratic as a key electoral strategy. 
But the party's future prospects, and the country's, would be better served by expanding Republicans' appeal to women; to younger voters; to the growing numbers of Americans with college educations; and, particularly, to urban voters, who include most Latinos, African-Americans and Asian-Americans.
To do so, Republicans would have to offer something beyond the ''government is bad'' mantra that alienates many of these potential constituents, an economic program more credible than trickle-down tax cuts, and backward-looking social policies.
A move toward pragmatism will not come easily to a party dominated by ideological hard-liners, but electoral failure may push some Republican leaders to counter the party's dwindling appeal with policies that appeal to more Americans. We should all wish them success.

Readers React
Mr. Lieberfeld concludes his counsel of moderation to Republican leaders by urging us to ''wish them success.'' I'd rather wish them sayonara.
They've foisted faulty ideas and pushed political extremism for far too long. Yes, we need a rational conservative opposition, and Republicans once were. But they've been taken hostage by their fundamentalist right wing and are being left behind by the demographic evolution of the American electorate.
Every once in a great while in our history, a major American party goes extinct. For the Grand Old Party, the party may well be over.
STEVE NELSON Washington, Mass., Nov. 14, 2012
As a lifelong Republican whose first vote was cast for Barry Goldwater, in 1964, I have seen my party hijacked by the religious right and the Tea Party elements. It has embraced a policy of exclusion of mainstream America.
By fielding candidates who campaigned on defunding Planned Parenthood, who sought to restrict women's access to basic health care, including contraception and abortion, and who did not understand that rape is a violent crime no matter the circumstances, the Republican Party gave itself no chance to win the presidency or the Senate. Voices of moderation within the party were nowhere to be found until after the election.
The problem, as many of us party faithful recognize, is not only the message, but the messengers. Only when a leader emerges who recognizes that women's health is an election game-changer will the Republican Party be a viable player in future elections.
RANDY MOODY National Co-chairman Republicans for Planned Parenthood Lincoln, Neb., Nov. 14, 2012
The Republicans' problem is that any move toward the center will make them indistinguishable from the Democrats. In my view, the Democrats are a center-right party, and there is simply no space for any sane positions to the right of them. That is why the Republicans spend most of their time criticizing President Obama for things he hasn't actually done (raise taxes, move toward socialism, pass job-killing regulations, abandon Israel and so on).
President Obama is doing almost all the things that the Republicans have always said they wanted. They reject him only because they want power for themselves.
What America needs is an actual progressive liberal party that is to the left of the Democrats, so there can be a genuine liberal-conservative dialogue. Then the Republicans can go the way of the Whigs and the Know-Nothings.
TEED ROCKWELL Berkeley, Calif., Nov. 14, 2012
Some people are saying we ''conservatives'' should move to the left if we want to win elections. That is not an option! I would rather see the G.O.P. lose every election than become ''light Democrats.''
Some of us feel that we will have to answer to a ''higher power,'' so we will not embrace abortion, amnesty for illegal immigrants, socialized medicine and cuts to our military to pay for entitlements. The liberal media have done a great job making half of our citizens believe that America is the problem.
MICHAEL A. PACER Paso Robles, Calif., Nov. 14, 2012
One of the most disappointing results for the G.O.P. was its inability to achieve the goal of regaining a majority in the Senate. Despite potential opportunities for victories in Indiana, Connecticut, Ohio and Missouri, Republicans failed to win any of the seats viewed as vulnerable by many political insiders.
One of the reasons these losses occurred was that Republicans on the state level have chosen to forget or ignore the advice of the late conservative commentator William F. Buckley Jr. He believed that it was critical to support not only the most conservative candidate, but also the one who had the best chance of winning.
While Mr. Buckley believed that ideas had consequences, he was also a pragmatist. That pragmatism may well have served Republicans better had they not selected such ideologically narrow candidates, who despite success in their respective primaries still went down to defeat on Election Day.
LAURENCE JURDEM New York, Nov. 15, 2012
The writer is a doctoral student in American political history at Fordham University.
After spending the last week reading the post-mortems on the Republican presidential campaign, I am not surprised that G.O.P. pundits and analysts still miss the point. The Republicans show lack of respect for differing views; one Texas Republican called the voters who re-elected President Obama ''maggots.''
They show lack of respect for women, for immigrants and minorities, for gay people, for unions. They deny science; they reject climate change. After alienating half of the electorate, it isn't rational for them to think that a majority will cast ballots for their agenda. Until the G.O.P. shows sincere respect for diversity, it will continue to lose nationally.
This is my advice: Work toward moving everyone forward rather than blaming, stigmatizing or excluding. Be credible in your opposition; support your point of view with facts and evidence. Stop believing that people don't get your message; we got it and rejected it. Decide on which positions you can compromise. Realize that you may need to ignore the extreme right wing of your party to return to power.
GRACE MICHALAKES Boulder, Colo., Nov. 14, 2012
I am an ordained Protestant minister who believes that the Republican Party could gain by respecting the barrier between church and state. The fact that the Bible says something doesn't mean that a nation with citizens of varied religious backgrounds -- or no religious beliefs at all -- should make it law. In addition, much of what the religious right calls scriptural is not. Nowhere does the Bible comment on abortion.
The religious beliefs of others should not be forced on people who are not of the same mind. It's part of the controlling personality of the Republican Party that others find repulsive.
JANE MYERS PERRINE Austin, Tex., Nov. 14, 2012
Like Mr. Lieberfeld, I would welcome a more open-minded Republican Party. But I fear that his appeal is doomed to fall on deaf ears.
The G.O.P. is dominated by its base -- the people who, during the party's primary debates, booed a gay veteran and shouted that uninsured sick people should be left to die. The daily vitriol spewed on conservative Web sites and talk shows still carries the day.
It seems as if the party's overriding hatred is of modernity itself, of all the changes that have taken place over the past half century. This is the common thread uniting the opponent of gay rights, the anti-government zealot and the white man who cannot accept the idea of a black president.
The dialogue of which Mr. Lieberfeld speaks can begin only when Republican ideology focuses on the world as it is, rather than the fantasy of a perfect past.
PHILIP BERROLL New York, Nov. 15, 2012
The Writer Responds
Mr. Nelson's wishes notwithstanding, the Republican Party is far from finished: Republican appointees are a majority on the Supreme Court, and the party still controls the House of Representatives, most state legislatures and most governorships. However, the party's cohesiveness will be strained, if not dissolved, by a struggle between those like Mr. Pacer, who would rather be right than popular, and pragmatists, like those Mr. Jurdem cites, who prioritize winning national and statewide elections.
Mr. Rockwell, like Mr. Pacer, rules out Republicans' moving toward the center because they would be ''indistinguishable from the Democrats,'' but this seems overblown: The party has room to moderate its policies and rhetoric -- as Mr. Moody, Ms. Michalakes and Ms. Perrine advise -- because Republicans have lurched so far to the right since the 1980s.
Voters want choices, and there will inevitably be dissatisfaction with sclerotic or corrupt aspects of Democrats' governance. A Republican Party that offers an affirmative vision of government and does not disdain urban voters will be best positioned to attract disaffected Democrats and independents. The radical right wing might well decamp from such a party, but as a Republican senator, Lindsey Graham, observed before the election, ''We're not generating enough angry white guys to stay in business for the long term.''
Mr. Rockwell also contends that America is waiting for a party to the left of the Democrats. We had one recently: The Green Party probably enabled the Republican win in 2000 and its near-total evaporation in national politics since then (0.3 percent of the vote in 2012) suggests that the appeal of such a party is, in fact, negligible.

 BODY:
When you see a merger between two giants in a declining industry, it can look like the financial version of a couple having a baby to save a marriage. At least that was my thought when Random House and Penguin, two of the world's six largest publishers, announced that they were coming together last month. Ever since Amazon began ripping apart the book business, the largest houses have been looking for a way to fight back. If this merger is any indication, they have chosen an old-fashioned strategy: Size.
A combined Penguin-Random House, which would control a quarter of the global book market, is a conglomerate designed to take on another giant, though it's not exactly a fair fight. Because the new entity will only have about a twelfth of Amazon's annual sales, most observers expect that this is just the beginning of a series of mergers -- like those in the music business -- that will take the Big Six publishers down to the Big Three and perhaps one day even the Big One. As John Makinson, Penguin's chief executive, told The Times, ''We decided it was better to get in early rather than be a follower.'' The question is whether this strategy will work. 
There are two competing predictions about commerce in the digital age. One is that companies will get smaller and more disruptive as nimble entrepreneurs can take on giant corporations with little more than 3-D printers and Web sites. The other envisions a few massive companies -- like Procter & Gamble, Apple and Nike -- that design everything themselves, have it manufactured cheaply in Asia and use their e-commerce sites to gather information about their customers. Nearly the exact same conflict occurred more than a century ago in the decade that straddled 1900, which was also a period of rapid technological change. In just a few years, 1,800 small companies were swallowed up as the electrical-power, telephone, auto, steel and chemical industries grew from patchworks of tiny companies into conglomerates. In ''The Great Merger Movement in American Business 1895-1904,'' the Yale economist and historian Naomi Lamoreaux wrote that back then everyone worried about the same thing that authors, editors and book buyers worry about now: Are large companies good for the economy? Do they grow through efficiency and innovation or by abusing their leverage?
Lamoreaux found that they did both, and many turn-of-the-century examples suggest what might happen to Penguin-Random and others. On one end of the spectrum, Lamoreaux told me, was U.S. Steel. Its predecessor companies competed by finding new ways of making steel at ever-lower prices. But after J. P. Morgan merged three companies into one behemoth, he discovered a better way to profit. Because all steel producers bought iron ore from the Mesabi Range in Minnesota, U.S. Steel bought most of the range and locked much of the rest of it in long-term contracts. As a result, the company hardly worried about competition; it had little need to innovate or compete on price, which made everything from cars to soda cans more expensive. Worse, it left a massive industry unprepared for the growth of innovative Asian companies during the 1970s and 1980s. By then, U.S. Steel all but collapsed, and a chunk of the U.S. economy went down with it.
Sears & Roebuck, on the other end, ''grew by solving market and technical problems,'' Lamoreaux said, and, as it solved them, its market share increased. Unable to monopolize anything like iron ore, Sears needed to innovate to stay ahead. Through constant competition with Montgomery Ward and others, it adopted new strategies that ultimately benefited its customers. When the company got into trouble, closed stores and was bought in 2005 by a struggling competitor, Kmart, the retail industry was robust enough that the overall economy barely noticed.
The future of book publishing is somewhere between the two poles. Oddly enough, it seems to mirror what happened to the envelope business. In the early 1900s the envelope industry was large enough to support several big companies. Then the mergers started, and an industry of numerous small companies became two giants. Eventually, the envelope industry wasn't large enough to sustain itself, and the companies became tiny divisions of larger conglomerates. U.S. Envelope still lives as a small part of the packaging manufacturer MeadWestvaco. American Envelope was bought by Cenveo, a business-stationery company whose chief executive, Robert G. Burton Sr., made clear that the century of mergers and buyouts is not over. ''We've had people knocking on the door,'' he told shareholders in August.
This kind of consolidation started in publishing long before the Penguin-Random merger. Random House, an arm of the media company Bertelsmann in Germany, is itself made up of former independents like Knopf and Pantheon. Penguin, a division of the education publisher Pearson, contains Dutton, Viking and others. If market forces were the only concern, it's possible that there would soon be only one or two publishers and that they might be folded into some larger infotainment company like Time Warner Penguin or maybe Random Viacom. There would still be books -- just not large book companies.
Every analysis I've read of the Penguin-Random House merger mentions the inevitable scrutiny of the antitrust lawyers at the Department of Justice, who are eager to prevent any potential monopoly in publishing. But it's difficult to imagine how, in the digital world, publishers could ever monopolize the sale of written material. Even if there were only one house left, it would compete with every blogger and self-published e-book author. Eventually, it's likely that book publishing will embody both conflicting visions of digital-age commerce -- lots of small businesses and a few massive ones that handle big-ticket items.
History suggests that the antitrust lawyers should be more concerned about government-issued patents, which allow large corporations to buy up vaguely worded deeds that can be used to sue upstarts out of existence. This is the iron ore of the digital age and many large companies are gobbling up as many patents as they can. Reuters recently reported that Amazon (which somehow holds a patent for the ''one-click shopping'' button) was hiring several high-profile patent lawyers with the mandate to ''identify and evaluate strategic I.P. acquisition and licensing opportunities.'' The company has argued that it buys up patents to defend against the lawsuits of others. That may be partly true, but the worst fate for readers isn't the merger of a few struggling companies in a diminishing business. It's the threat of another U.S. Steel.
Deep thoughts this week:
1. Book publishing is turning to mergers out of desperation.
2. Will it work?
3. The answer may lie in the envelope industry, which survived by disappearing.

HEADLINE: 'Girls Love Math.We Never Stop Doing It.'

BYLINE: By CARINA CHOCANO

 BODY:
I live in Los Angeles, where despite my best efforts, I occasionally hear a story like this: A friend knows an actress whose burglar alarm code -- 2828 -- serves as a reminder to her of the age she must never surpass. (The repetition adds a touch of hysteria, which I like.) Another friend lives next door to a model-actress who, in her late 20s, is considered to be so far out on the ledge of her prime that she was recently cast opposite a 40-something man as the mother of two teenage children. While the age distribution represented is biologically feasible (it's possible that a woman could have her first child, with a 30-year-old husband, at age 12), child marriage is generally frowned upon even in California. 
Not long ago, I watched the pilot episode of ''The Mindy Project,'' a comedy about a freshly minted obstetrician whose basic human value is called into question by her failure to have married someone -- anyone -- by her implied, if unstated, deadline. In one scene, Kaling, who is 33 in real life (and playing 31), goes on a blind date with a guy played by Ed Helms, who is 38 (and playing no one cares), when they are interrupted by an urgent phone call from the son of one of her patients. Annoyed at having to take the call, she grabs the phone from the hostess and hisses, ''Do you know how difficult it is for a chubby 31-year-old woman to go on a legit date with a guy who majored in economics at Duke?''
I have no idea how hard this is, because when I was 31 (I'm now 44), I would have done anything to avoid enduring such an ordeal. But that's not the point. The point is that we're meant to identify with Mindy's desperation and buy into it, to perform whatever mental contortions are necessary to look upon her with pity, and despise her just a little for reaching 31 with nothing to show for it, except, of course, a medical degree. If Malcolm Gladwell is right about it taking 10,000 hours, or 10 years, to truly master the thing you care about most, then Kaling's character faces the depressing prospect of being over the hill before she even gets within shooting distance of the hill.
''What we see on broadcast television is that the majority of female characters are in their 20s and 30s,'' says Martha M. Lauzen, the executive director of the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film at San Diego State University, in Jennifer Siebel Newsom's documentary, ''Miss Representation.'' ''That is just a huge misrepresentation of reality, and that really skews our perceptions.'' In reality, the documentary says, ''women in their teens, 20s and 30s are 39 percent of the population, yet are 71 percent of women on TV. Women 40 and older are 47 percent of the population, yet are 26 percent of women on TV.'' And the women in their 20s and 30s on TV are too often depicted as freaking out about their age, reinforcing the idea that life ends when adulthood begins.
''When any group is not featured in the media, they have to wonder, Well, what part do I play in this culture?'' Lauzen says. ''There's actually an academic term for that. It's called 'symbolic annihilation.' ''
Nobody disputes the fact that age is more cruel to women than men. But why don't we? Take a look at Facebook, tireless corroborator of the relentless march of time and its startling effect on the boys I knew in high school. The girls don't shock in the same way. They tend to hang on to their hair. They submit to the torture of Pilates. They can moisturize without inspiring a Morgan Spurlock documentary. They look fine; in other words, they kind of look the same.
This is just superficial evidence of what science seems to be telling us. Suddenly, the news seems full of quiet debunkings of evolutionary psychology's most cherished chestnuts, not to mention reports on the hazards of middle-aged sperm and hopeful sci-fi tidings about the creation of fertile eggs from the stem cells of Japanese mice.
And yet (mouse stem cells aside), the tragic, grotesque, totally unfair and yet unassailable ephemerality of a woman's so-called prime is a trope we privilege over any evidence to the contrary. We expect women to submit to its incontrovertible veracity with equanimity and shame, and we expect men to be gracious about it and try not to gloat. Mostly, we expect nobody to notice or question the different ways in which ''primeness'' is constructed for each sex, which is not based on the same criteria at all. If, as Hegel suggested, ideas are not just ideas but come wrapped in all flavor of attitudes, then this particular idea is a giant, Gorgonzola-stuffed, bacon-wrapped fig of a notion: decadent, cloying, aged, cured in centuries of spin, warmed over and passed around again and again.
I've thought about this a lot, because for most of my life, I've looked and sounded younger than my age. When I was pregnant, at 40, the nurses at my OB-GYN's office would look at my chart and do double takes. After my daughter was born, strangers would rhapsodize about the rolling vistas of fertility that stretched before me. At 23, I looked about 16, and not a lanky, dead-eyed, ectomorphic 16, either, but a short, squeaky-voiced, snub-nosed 16; the kind of 16 that gets patted on the head. In job interviews, I clocked the time it took for the initial look of surprise on the interviewer's face to relax into a look of fond condescension. A potential landlord once hung up on me for asking about the availability of an apartment, the rent on which I clearly would never be able to swing, given my vocal range. While I recognize that it's probably preferable to the opposite, I can't say that looking young has been particularly advantageous, professionally or even socially. It never got me much beyond getting carded while buying beer.
What does pay the big bucks (although apparently not as often as we think) is this trick of looking 30ish while actually being 13, as long as you are also very tall and able to maintain the body mass of a cricket. This has always been the case, but recently it has become even more so, making it harder to ignore the question of how young is too young to dedicate your life to trudging down a glorified auction block on your way to the fashion abattoir. Runway models provoke the same kind of dissonance as toddler beauty pageants, which similarly ask us to hold two irreconcilable messages (sexy baby) in our minds at the same time, and thus produce psychological discomfort by subconsciously calling attention to the cultural practice of systematically replacing images of adult women with images of kids in old-lady drag.
Still, the issue hadn't seemed particularly pressing until I read a series of Op-Eds in a New York Times Room for Debate series about a guideline by the Council of Fashion Designers of America that suggests a minimum age requirement of 16 for runway models.
''Note that the gender-neutral models that need protecting here are implicitly girls, not boys,'' wrote Ashley Mears, an assistant professor of pop culture and gender sociology at Boston University and the author of a book about the economics of modeling, in her Op-Ed. ''Partly this stems from the entrenched celebration of women, not men, on display, and partly because male models in fashion tend to be older than their female counterparts. A 16-year-old boy on the catwalk would be as rare a sighting as a 35-year-old woman.''
Of course I already knew this. Everybody knows this. But sometimes you're blinded to the reality of something by its sheer, naturalizing prevalence. A couple of weeks ago, I was flipping through the September issue of Harper's Bazaar when I stopped to look at a guide titled ''Fabulous at Every Age'' -- detailing how to look stylish in your 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s and 70s-plus. Mostly, the guide was made up of pictures of garments laid flat against a background, unviolated by human form. But each decade was also accompanied by a large photo of a model and a small insert of a nonmodel (half of whom were former models) representing her age group. The whole thing seemed fairly inclusive and democratic. (They went all the way to the 70s and older.) But the discrepancy between the models and the ''real people'' grew more jarring as the ages advanced, so that by the time we arrived at 70-plus, a small photo of Barbara Walters was dwarfed by a picture of a 16-year-old girl who could have been her great-granddaughter, looking sad in her dowager costume.
Pairing pictures of adolescent girls with adult men, or of young women with middle-aged men, to suggest age parity produces cognitive dissonance on a mass scale. So does constantly reinforcing the idea that a 33-year-old woman like Kaling is somehow ''older'' than a man who is seven years older than she. By locating the aspirational ideal squarely in the past of nearly everyone who consumes it, it puts almost all women and most girls in an ontological double bind from which nobody emerges unscathed. The most insidious thing about it, however, is that it promotes a false equivalence between youth and worth, between adolescence and adulthood. As one commenter on the Room for Debate series wrote: ''Looking at children as examples of my adulthood feels wrong.''
It's funny that they made that Barbie who said she thinks ''math class is tough!'' Girls love math. We never stop doing it. When I was 12, I often lay awake in bed frantically performing mental calculations to help me figure out when, exactly, I would get to live my life as an adult. If I finish graduate school at, say, 28, that leaves me six months to a year in which to work/live before having children by the drop-dead cutoff of 30.
This was around the same time that I waited breathlessly for the twice-yearly arrival of the newspaper fashion supplements that had row after row of small photos from the clothing collections. Something about the monastic severity of the models spoke to me. They looked so grown up, so deadly serious in their exquisite, artful, status-conferring garments, signaling discretionary income, power and leisure to burn. I guess that what I thought I was looking at was a kind of ideal of adult womanhood in its most fully realized state -- unencumbered, sophisticated, youthful in outlook and yet mature, witty and cosmopolitan. I would have been so surprised to learn that the same girls, off the runway, might have been just a couple of years ahead of me in school.
For years, I worried that I would be dismissed for being too young right up until the moment when I started being dismissed for being too old. That means I spent a disproportionate piece of my 20s and 30s thinking it was all over. I remember crying to a male friend that my time was running out; that I didn't think I would be able to squeeze it all in before my built-in expiration date. I was 24. Meanwhile, my 23-year-old roommate would languish on the couch wailing, ''I feel like a piece of fruit rotting on the vine!'' I look back at this now -- at how bad, how ashamed I felt for letting myself turn 29 -- and I can't believe how much of my youth I squandered on feeling old.

HEADLINE: Bright Passage

BYLINE: By AMY EPHRON

 BODY:
A cruise rookie gets her sea legs.
The ship had launched in Lisbon and passed Morocco before we boarded in the sleepy seaside city of Valencia, Spain, where the boardwalk is studded with palm trees, beds of red roses and tattooed skateboarders streaming by. It's the birthplace of paella, and food was about to be trending.
I was sad that we'd missed Morocco. But it turned out everyone had missed Morocco. There had been an anti-American demonstration in the streets of Casablanca, spurred by the inflammatory film "Innocence of Muslims," and a decision had been made to skip that port and spend the day at sea. Yet another reason, for some, to travel by cruise ship, in the protected and rarefied environment of a floating hotel. 
My husband, Alan, and I had never taken a commercial cruise, so we were a little apprehensive. Would we feel trapped? Isolated? We're so A.D.D. - it's not just our children who bring their iPhones to the table. As it happened, I'd already lost mine at the Air France gate at LAX, which I took as a sign. But would Alan get seasick? It didn't occur to me that I would. Would we be accosted in what seemed to us a communal adventure with 1,200 strangers, or would we be able to carve out a place of our own?
Statuesque and streamlined - reminiscent of the first time I saw a 747 on a runway - the M.S. Riviera hit the seas four months ago, the newest in the Oceania Cruises fleet. M.S. Riviera stands for Motor Ship Riviera, but as if it were a vanity California license plate, I instantly transformed it to Ms. and claimed her as my own.
As we entered the double-height lobby with a sweeping staircase and a brilliant over-the-top crystal chandelier, some childlike gene kicked in, as if we'd been shipped off to high-end summer camp. Thoughts of Disneyland and the impish Eloise at the Plaza came to mind. Although I don't know what anyone would have thought of me if I'd actually "skittered" down the hallway.
A hint of luxury as we entered our cabin: a white orchid that seemed strangely at home on the water; a plate of Mediterranean figs and the sweetest wild strawberries; Wi-Fi, a little bit slow; a high-definition flat screen TV for news and entertainment in case you wanted to check out or, conversely, stay in touch, which somewhat countered the fear of claustrophobia and isolation; Bulgari soaps and bath salts; a duvet cover I wish I owned; and sliding glass doors out onto a terrace and a spectacular view of the ever changing waters of the Mediterranean Sea. Color of the sea in Valencia: sky blue.
Did I mention Vijay the butler, who would appear as if on tiptoe every morning with a white tablecloth and the breakfast of your choice? There was a kind of "Upstairs Downstairs" feeling to it all, and we tipped him practically every time he knocked on the door, although he didn't seem to expect it.
Our first night at dinner, when my Iberian (local, acorn-fed) pork chop arrived, another childhood memory kicked in, and I thought, "I wish I had some . . . ," just as the waiter magically appeared and said, 'Would you like some . . . applesauce?' " I felt like I was home.
There was a flash of light outside the stateroom curtains - that impish gene kicked in again as I quietly dressed and made my way to the top deck. The pitch-black sky lit up in a panoramic view of lightning strikes, like a well-timed electrical grid. It was incredible, until I realized, after a moment, that even though the captain was steering away from the storm, the storm might have other ideas, and it might not be the best idea to be on the highest point in the ocean in the middle of an electrical storm. But the ship had "wings" - a computer-controlled hydraulic stabilizing system - and back in the cabin, except for the streaks of light behind the curtains, we never felt as if we were in the midst of a storm at sea.
In Barcelona, after the rain had stopped, Alan and I went off on our own to the 600-year-old Barcelona Cathedral. It is the resting place of Santa Eulalia, who is guarded by 13 white geese because she died at age 13. Its neo-Gothic facade is graced by gargoyles, powerful and haunting renderings of animals both real and imagined, and in the adjacent small museum a display case holds crosses encrusted with emeralds, sapphires and diamonds so gothic in size and staggeringly beautiful that it's hard to imagine who had the girth to wear them.
It's a whirlwind way to tour six cities - the museums, churches, restaurants of your (or their) choosing - without the bother of having to pack and unpack. But there's also a secret inside the Ms. Riviera: the "Culinary Discovery Tours," hosted by the C.I.A.-trained chef Kathryn Kelly. (C.I.A., by the way, stands for Culinary Institute of America, and I wish I could put either of the C.I.A.'s in front of my name.) Chef Kelly is plain-spoken, direct, 5-foot-10 and imposing with her chef's jacket, blond hair and porcelain skin. And she has a surprising sense of humor.
A small van of 24 guests (couples, sisters, home chefs, all bound by a love of food) led by Chef Kelly and a local tour guide drove to the port city of Marseille and stopped at an outdoor farmers' market. She gave out a shopping list, ingredients to be used for that afternoon's cooking class on the ship, and doled out a small allowance. As we left the bus, she said, "Be back in 20 minutes." I came in under budget and gave her back my change. Chef Kelly inspires honesty.
The tour guide was conversant in architecture, too. She pointed out the iconic Le Corbusier apartment building - with its Mir-like facade of red-orange, turquoise and yellow blocks constructed between 1946 and 1952 - and I realized that it informed some of the work Frank Gehry went on to do in Los Angeles. I felt as if I'd already learned something that day. The van turned off the highway, past grape fields and hidden chateaus and herds of sheep that appear like Impressionist paintings on the landscape, down a dirt road to our destination, the Cassis Bodin winery at Chateu de Fontblanche, which dates back to the 17th century. Here, Chef Gui Gedda, who is 80 and perky as ever, had prepared a lunch worthy of a Michelin star or the Cannes festival, whose kitchen he ran for a number of years. As we sipped ros in the back rustic patio (actually, it was noon and I was drinking sparkling water) with a view of the grape fields a few feet away, we all felt as if we were very much "inside" Provence.
Chef Kelly's instructional method is a bit like a Russian ballet teacher's. There is a precise way to cut a shallot! Two to a station, the students had sinks, cutting boards and stove tops of their own. At the front of the class, Chef Kelly was live-screened, Food Network-style, her culinary expertise on view for her students behind her. Ratatouille was on the menu, and as one of her students, a Chinese woman who luckily had a sense of humor, added the eggplant and zucchini, the chef screamed, "This is not wok cooking." That was followed by an expert lesson in a perfect chicken aux fines herbes.+
There is also a library on the ship. Philippa Gregory was popular by the pool. But I was reading "Boomerang: Travels in the New Third World," Michael Lewis's genius but oddly pitched travelogue of the hot spots of the economic meltdown - an interesting choice as it was an interesting time to be visiting Spain and Italy. In many of the shops and restaurants, fears about the economy were palpable, and the euro was descending daily. But except for one conversation I overheard about the "imminent collapse" of the health care system, the boat didn't seem quite so anxious.
A celebrity sighting at sea - there were whispers on the deck by the pool: "Bill Gates is in town." "How do you know that?" "Well, there's Paul Allen's boat." I don't know how anyone knew they might be traveling together, but the Octopus was discreetly anchored out at sea. Midnight blue and formidable, it has two helicopters and a submarine, which I prefer to think is unarmed and mostly used for underwater fish viewing. We watched as it seemingly changed its mind, turned its engine on and made its way back out to international waters. Not really a celebrity sighting, more like a celebrity boat sighting, but still . . . it gave new meaning to the idea of being able to come and go as you please.
The people on the ship who were having the best time were traveling in packs. There was a Chinese family - a husband, his wife, her sister and brother-in-law, who all live in Amsterdam, and a man they call "uncle" and his wife, who still live in Hong Kong - who took us to dinner the last night and ordered incredibly expensive wine. The patriarch has a business importing French Bordeaux to China. (Yes, it is true that the Chinese are buying most of the French Bordeaux.) He told me that he doesn't travel to America because he said a friend of his went recently and that we "ask too many questions." Having no idea what that meant, I didn't question him further. He didn't give us his card.
It was in the run-up to the national election, and the ambient noise on the ship was somewhat political. My first night I was speaking to a very nice gentleman. I told him I was tired because I'd been to the Democratic convention the week before. His wife interrupted immediately. "Oh dear," she said, "we're not having any luck today, are we?" I turned away for a moment and when I turned back, they were gone. (My fault. I'd broken two rules of social etiquette: never mention politics to a stranger, and always speak to the woman first, especially if you're a woman.) But mostly, like seemed to find like, and there was an air of civility that generated from the top, from the charming and precise Italian captain of the ship, Luca Manzi, an officer and a gentleman.
Captain Manzi comes by his trade honestly, having done a stint in the Italian Navy. A highlight: when we docked in Monaco and were not setting sail that night, he invited Alan and me to the bridge for a glass of Champagne at sunset. The bridge was extraordinary, reminiscent of a high-tech sound studio or Mission Control, absolutely spotless, with the crew in perfectly pressed uniforms and caps. Manzi insists he likes to navigate manually, despite the vast array of computer and radar technology on a console the size of the Ritz. The view out the curved windows was spectacular - the boat show was in town - and the waters of the Mediterranean were deep blue, the color of dark sapphires, which someone told me had to do with the depth of the ocean but which I took to have other, richer connotations.
Later that night on our terrace, we watched a magnificent display of fireworks over the port of Monaco, the Casino de Monte-Carlo lit up on the hill, and I was hit with a certain wistfulness, the way you feel the week before camp is over, a feeling that there was one more stop before you had to return to real life.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: A Restless Lifetime of Paying Attention

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY

 BODY:
''I CALL it the Zen bell,'' the photographer Joel Meyerowitz was saying recently, sitting in the sunshine in his Upper West Side apartment and studio, describing a nagging compulsion to begin a long-term project about banks in the wake of the Great Recession. ''I'm not getting any ding from anywhere else right now, and I keep hearing it ringing. So I'm going to pay attention.''
During a career that turns 50 this year Mr. Meyerowitz has heeded the oracular signal so many different ways, in so many places, that his work has often seemed to be the product of more than one person: Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, where he made himself into a well-known street photographer in the early 1960s; Cape Cod, where his pictures of sky and artificial light helped crash the use of color into the black-and-white art photography world; Europe, where his cinematically complex urban scenes influenced a younger generation of photographers; ground zero after the Sept. 11 attacks, where he almost single-handedly created a pictorial archive of the recovery and cleanup. 
The publication this month of ''Taking My Time,'' a heavy-duty two-volume retrospective book from Phaidon, puts these bodies of work in one place for the first time. And in weaving them together with scores of pictures never before published, it is likely to go a long way toward redefining the career of a groundbreaking artist who has had a tendency to fade into the background among his contemporaries.
If William Eggleston's pictures pack the gothic punch of Flannery O'Connor, and Lee Friedlander's, with their deadpan wit, look as if they were taken by Augie March, Mr. Meyerowitz's have always seemed like William Maxwell short stories -- beautifully made, deeply perceptive but often so understated as to risk being overlooked, or not looked at closely enough.
For those who recognize his name mostly because of ''Cape Light,'' the 1979 book that pioneered the use of color but whose scenes of summer cottages and ice cream shops are usually read through a haze of nostalgia, the retrospective book and a related two-part exhibition at the Howard Greenberg Gallery on East 57th Street in Manhattan will undoubtedly come as a surprise.
In many of his early street pictures, taken after Mr. Meyerowitz walked away from a good job at an advertising agency and began prowling Manhattan -- often with Garry Winogrand, a fellow twenty-something also about to make a name for himself -- America presents itself as a deceptively vertiginous place, teetering on the edge of late-'60s convulsion.
A pale woman in a 1963 photograph, her eyes clenched shut, holds a presciently paranoid handwritten sign: ''Electronic parts as small as the head of a pin have been made. A camera could go through the hollow of a hollow needle. Soon, 'Big Brother' may be able to sit in front of his TV and see or hear.'' In other pictures an all-American boy levels a toy pistol at a baby lying in a carriage; Jacqueline Kennedy's head, on a television, hovers plaintively above a milling crowd; two toy train cars list to the side behind dilapidated houses on a barren Western landscape.
''There's nobody who was doing quite as dramatically as Meyerowitz that kind of guerrilla style of street photography that he carried from the '60s into the color work of the '70s and '80s,'' said Brian Wallis, the chief curator of the International Center of Photography. ''I've never understood why he's never quite gotten his due.''
He said that in varying ways he saw Mr. Meyerowitz's influence on contemporary photography in the work of socially keen-eyed photographers like Paul Graham and Alec Soth. (Mr. Soth has written that he finds Mr. Meyerowitz's work ''unabashedly joyous,'' which he surmised hasn't helped his standing in the art world. ''But it suits his vision,'' he added.) But Mr. Wallis said he saw the influence even on photographers who have rejected, in part or whole, the tradition of in-the-moment photography and who compose images like painters: Jeff Wall, Philip-Lorca diCorcia, Gregory Crewdson.
Rineke Dijkstra, whose mesmerizing large-scale color portraiture was the subject of a retrospective that closed last month at the Guggenheim Museum, said that Mr. Meyerowitz's work was a ''real eye-opener'' for her as a student in Amsterdam in the 1980s. Like many other young European photographers, she was still working in black-and-white, but Mr. Meyerowitz's complex way with light in seemingly straightforward pictures of swimming pools and beaches helped her understand the power of color.
''There was this beautiful silence with no people,'' Ms. Dijkstra said by phone from Amsterdam. ''It affected me.'' She added that while Mr. Meyerowitz came of age toward the end of the great era of the street photographer, his pictures have always evinced a tension for her between the real and the ideal. ''You can see that it is a moment,'' she said of many of his best-known images. ''But they also look like, in a way, he tried to compose reality somehow.''
Mr. Meyerowitz, 74, who has been around photography long enough to understand its inherent fictions as well as anyone, naturally takes such observations as compliments. But he said he has never seen himself as anything other than a member, still staunchly observant, of the ''honor-what-you-see, the frame-is-the-frame generation.''
''The thought for us was always: 'How much could we absorb and embrace of a moment of existence that would disappear in an instant?' '' he said. ''And, 'Could we really make it live as art?' There was an almost moral dimension.''
The story of his formative years reads now like a trip through the pantheon. Mr. Meyerowitz, who was raised in a working-class family in the Bronx, was working as an art director at an advertising firm when he was assigned to accompany Robert Frank on a mundane commercial assignment. Mr. Frank had only recently published ''The Americans,'' which would go on to become one of the most important books in the history of photography. Mr. Meyerowitz knew nothing about him but remembers being stunned by the way he moved and used the camera, and what the camera got from so little. He said, ''I thought, 'My God, everything is so filled with anima.' ''
He quit his job not long after. Piecing his financial life together by working as a building superintendent, he took a Pentax lent by his former boss (''He said to me: 'You want to be a photographer? It's a craft.' '') and began teaching himself to be a street photographer.
He met Winogrand -- whose style had a decided effect on his own, though the influence ran both ways -- when they were both on the subway on the way to visit their mothers in the Bronx. (Winogrand died in 1984.)
Mr. Meyerowitz studied with Alexey Brodovitch and Richard Avedon. In 1963, while shooting people watching the St. Patrick's Day parade, he noticed an elegantly dressed man working the crowd too and realized it was Henri Cartier-Bresson. ''He was weaving and dodging,'' he said. ''He looked like Jacques Tati.'' He nervously asked him to coffee and the great photographer accepted.
''The one thing I knew at that time was that I needed to be on the street,'' said Mr. Meyerowitz, who, slim, tall and now strikingly bald, looks like a Tibetan monk and exudes a complementary air of almost Buddhist contentedness. (His large apartment and studio, decorated with photographs -- including one of him by Avedon -- is a model of organized efficiency.)
''When I look back at who that kid was in the early 1960s, I was still painting, a kind of hard-edge abstraction,'' he added. ''But I was really hooked on an Ashcan-School-like view of real life, of the messiness and the complexity of it.''
The question of whether to shoot in color, a divisive one for art photographers at the time, many of whom saw color as hopelessly commercial, was never much of a question for him. He was carrying two cameras -- one with black-and-white film and one with color -- as early as 1965, and as soon as he was able to afford color darkroom equipment, he was shooting in color. ''There were more elements at play,'' he said. ''The simple fact of the matter was that it just provided more information, and I wanted more information.''
By the mid-1970s he also began to grow restless with his own ideas about what good pictures meant. He started taking what he called field photographs, shots in which he tried to look beyond an obvious hook, a single locus of action -- Cartier-Bresson's ''decisive moment'' -- and instead shoot from much further back to encompass more complex scenes. He said: ''I wanted a picture that didn't say itself right away, that didn't give itself up. But that's always risky, because you work with this fear that in trying to get too much, maybe you're not getting anything.''
The philosophy, which lends a remarkably contemporary feel to many of his 1970s and 1980s pictures, laid the groundwork for the pictures that he took with a wooden view camera over nine months in 2001 and 2002 at ground zero, which became the basis for ''Aftermath,'' an archive of recovery pictures, published in 2006. ''I wasn't interested in making a great picture or a good picture,'' he said. ''I only wanted to get as much of what was happening there as I could, because it was my responsibility to history. It was my one chance to understand something about the making of history.''
Working for two years on the retrospective book, he said, was his first attempt to understand his own history. ''I wanted it to be like an autobiography, with not only the successes but also the dead ends,'' he said, ''the things I don't know if I've understood yet.''
He has never stopped shooting on the street. ''I always have a camera,'' he said. ''If I'm out, I'm out.'' But for the last several years he has been at work on a much more esoteric kind of project: making pictures to illustrate the classical elements of earth, fire, water and air.
''And let me tell you, a picture of dirt can be pretty damned dull,'' he said. ''I ask myself: 'Is this insane? Is this another dead end or a way in?' I'm still trying to find out.''

THE BIG PROFILE: KEVIN POLLAK
By David Itzkoff
He may be the master of countless celebrity impressions, but Kevin Pollak, the actor, comedian and poker ace, is careful about which ones he takes credit for. ''Anyone who is doing Shatner now is doing my William Shatner,'' says Pollak, also the author of a new memoir, ''How I Slept My Way to the Middle.'' He honors Jay Mohr for bringing Christopher Walken imitations to the forefront, but adds: ''If you Google the phrase 'Christopher Walken impersonation,' out of about 130,000 search answers, I do come up first.''

LOOK OUT, BAMBI
By Peter Andrey Smith
Travelers who want to avoid hitting a deer should steer clear of West Virginia, where, according to State Farm, the odds of a driver hitting a deer in a 12-month period is 1 in 40. ''If your only goal is not to hit a deer,'' Dick Luedke, a company spokesman, says, Hawaii ''would be the best place to go.'' Despite working in Illinois, where the odds of a collision are 1 in 190, Luedke has had only one close call -- and that was while he was riding his bike.
FOR LOVE OF THE GAME
By Roger Bennett
For the owners of Greek soccer teams, desperate times call for desperate measures. As the nation's economy collapses, clubs are forging unorthodox sponsorships. A team in Larissa now takes the field in pink jerseys with the logo for Villa Erotica, a ''luxury brothel.'' The business's owner, Soula Alevridou, said the sponsorship was not for marketing purposes, but rather for the love of the game. ''It's not the kind of business that needs promotion,'' she explained.
TIME FOR MASS. AGAIN?
By Matt Bai
Before some Democrats get all excited about the idea of Elizabeth Warren in 2016, they should consider the recent record of Massachusetts candidates. Three times in the last 30 years, a major party nominated a Bay Stater, and each one in the end fell somewhere on the spectrum between disappointing and disastrous. It's almost enough to make you wonder if Cambridge and Back Bay really are just like the rest of America.
WHAT I'M DRINKING NOW
By Mario Batali
I'm not a huge fan of oaky whites, but on a special occasion, I ordered a bottle of Corton Charlemagne Domaine Tollot-Beaut 2008, a chardonnay, to accompany raw clams, oysters and foie gras. There is no better explosion of fruit, acidity, toasty vanilla mixed with sap and stone. It is not cheap,but it was a birthday, so we ordered a second bottle for the risotto.

Men in the 1860s, the historian Karen Abbott explains, were so used to ''women in crinolines and bonnets,'' they couldn't imagine one in pants. Some 400 women capitalized on this navet to fight in the Civil War wearing disguises. As the Army prosecutes a brigadier general on charges of sex crimes against five women, four of them officers, it seems that women still can't serve on their own terms.

JUDGE JOHN HODGMAN RULES
By John Hodgman
MICHAEL WRITES: While waiting to cross the street on a rainy day, I used my umbrella to cover an unprotected pedestrian without moving closer to him. When the light changed, the stranger stepped off the curb and into the rain. Did I violate his personal space?
Normally I would not rule between strangers, but in this case I enjoin you to keep your umbrella to yourself. While you clearly wished to be kind, you would not throw a hug around a human you deemed to be too cold. A properly functioning city relies on a mutual respect for personal space, individual human agency and not weirding other people out.

HOW TO EAT HEALTHFUL
By Bethenny Frankel
You should have an indulgence -- it could be a piece of pizza, it could be some chips, it could be a cookie -- every day, and you'll never binge. You'll never be deprived and all that. Diets do not work. It's a multibillion-dollar industry, and it's a sham. As told to Spencer Bailey

HEADLINE: The Liberal Gloat

BYLINE: By ROSS DOUTHAT

 BODY:
WINNING an election doesn't just offer the chance to govern the country. It offers a chance to feel morally and intellectually superior to the party you've just beaten. This is an inescapable aspect of democratic culture: no matter what reason tells us about the vagaries of politics, something in the American subconscious assumes that the voice of the people really is the voice of God, and that being part of a winning coalition must be a sign that you're His chosen one as well.
This means the losing coalition must be doomed to wander east of Eden, and liberals have been having a good time with this idea of late. ''Those poor, benighted Republicans!'' runs the subtext of their postelection commentary. ''They can't read polls! They can't reach Hispanics! They don't understand women! They don't have a team of Silicon Valley sorcerers running their turnout operations!'' 
Back in 2011, the Obama White House earned some mild mockery for its ''win the future'' slogan. But now that the president has been re-elected, the liberal conventional wisdom is that the Democrats have done just that -- that Republicans are now Radio Shack to their Apple store, ''The Waltons'' to their ''Modern Family,'' a mediocre Norman Rockwell to their digital-age mosaic.
Maybe it's too soon to pierce this cloud of postelection smugness. But in the spirit of friendly correction -- or, O.K., maybe curmudgeonly annoyance -- let me point out some slightly more unpleasant truths about the future that liberalism seems to be winning.
Liberals look at the Obama majority and see a coalition bound together by enlightened values -- reason rather than superstition, tolerance rather than bigotry, equality rather than hierarchy. But it's just as easy to see a coalition created by social disintegration and unified by economic fear.
Consider the Hispanic vote. Are Democrats winning Hispanics because they put forward a more welcoming face than Republicans do -- one more in keeping with America's tradition of assimilating migrants yearning to breathe free? Yes, up to a point. But they're also winning recent immigrants because those immigrants often aren't assimilating successfully -- or worse, are assimilating downward, thanks to rising out-of-wedlock birthrates and high dropout rates. The Democratic edge among Hispanics depends heavily on these darker trends: the weaker that families and communities are, the more necessary government support inevitably seems.
Likewise with the growing number of unmarried Americans, especially unmarried women. Yes, social issues like abortion help explain why these voters lean Democratic. But the more important explanation is that single life is generally more insecure and chaotic than married life, and single life with children -- which is now commonplace for women under 30 -- is almost impossible to navigate without the support the welfare state provides.
Or consider the secular vote, which has been growing swiftly and tilts heavily toward Democrats. The liberal image of a non-churchgoing American is probably the ''spiritual but not religious'' seeker, or the bright young atheist reading Richard Dawkins. But the typical unchurched American is just as often an underemployed working-class man, whose secularism is less an intellectual choice than a symptom of his disconnection from community in general.
What unites all of these stories is the growing failure of America's local associations -- civic, familial, religious -- to foster stability, encourage solidarity and make mobility possible.
This is a crisis that the Republican Party often badly misunderstands, casting Democratic-leaning voters as lazy moochers or spoiled children seeking ''gifts'' (as a certain former Republican presidential nominee would have it) rather than recognizing the reality of their economic struggles.
But if conservatives don't acknowledge the crisis's economic component, liberalism often seems indifferent to its deeper social roots. The progressive bias toward the capital-F Future, the old left-wing suspicion of faith and domesticity, the fact that Democrats have benefited politically from these trends -- all of this makes it easy for liberals to just celebrate the emerging America, to minimize the costs of disrupted families and hollowed-out communities, and to treat the places where Americans have traditionally found solidarity outside the state (like the churches threatened by the Obama White House's contraceptive mandate) as irritants or threats.
This is a great flaw in the liberal vision, because whatever role government plays in prosperity, transfer payments are not a sufficient foundation for middle-class success. It's not a coincidence that the economic era that many liberals pine for -- the great, egalitarian post-World War II boom -- was an era that social conservatives remember fondly as well: a time of leaping church attendance, rising marriage rates and birthrates, and widespread civic renewal and engagement.
No such renewal seems to be on the horizon. That isn't a judgment on the Obama White House, necessarily. But it is a judgment on a certain kind of blithe liberal optimism, and the confidence with which many Democrats assume their newly emerged majority is a sign of progress rather than decline.

HEADLINE: Another Client for Ms. Fix-It

BYLINE: By JUDITH NEWMAN

 BODY:
JUDY SMITH'S calling to crisis management came early. Her story went like this: The ''It'' couple in her middle-school class had broken up. Rumor had it that despite the boy's staunch denials, he had kissed another girl. Where others saw heartbreak, 11-year-old Judy saw opportunity. ''After hearing his side, I was convinced he was telling the truth,'' Ms. Smith wrote in her recent self-help memoir, ''Good Self, Bad Self: Transforming Your Worst Qualities Into Your Biggest Assets.'' She persuaded the girl of the boyfriend's trustworthiness, prompting Ms. Smith's own tween epiphany: if an emotionally uninvolved third party believed and argued for someone's innocence, the wronged party was more likely to believe it, too. And thus a career was born.
This week, proving that the problems of grade schoolers and besieged adults are not as different as one might suspect, Ms. Smith was hired to perform emergency rescue on the reputation of Jill Kelley, the Tampa socialite who touched off the sex scandal surrounding Gen. David Petraeus and his biographer, Paula Broadwell. 
Ms. Smith, Washington's ultimate fixer, has never wavered in her belief that everyone, especially the people paying her, deserves a second chance. Monica Lewinsky was a client. So was Larry Craig, the Republican former senator from Idaho (whose vehemently antigay policies in the Senate seemed to collide with his behavior in a Minnesota airport men's room). She has provided her services to foreign despots, corporations facing public relations disasters (BP, postspill); actors (Wesley Snipes, as he faced tax problems); and a professional athlete who found himself suddenly unsympathetic, unemployable and incarcerated when it was revealed he was a principal in a dog fighting ring. (Michael Vick, the Philadelphia Eagles quarterback, has volunteered to speak at events organized by the Humane Society of the United States.)
As the Petraeus story deepens, Ms. Kelley's reputation has not fared well. As has been widely reported and dissected in the news media (not to mention Twitter and all manner of other outlets), Ms. Kelley had originally complained to a friend at the F.B.I. that someone -- allegedly Ms. Broadwell -- had been sending her threatening ''stay-away-from-my-man'' e-mails. The imbroglio moved quickly from there, extending to reports that the same F.B.I. friend sent shirtless photos to Ms. Kelley; and then to the discovery of thousands of reportedly flirtatious e-mails exchanged between Ms. Kelley and General Petraeus's replacement in Afghanistan, Gen. John Allen.
This week, it broke that Ms. Kelley and her husband, a Tampa surgeon, are deeply in debt, with multiple lawsuits against them and at least two properties in foreclosure. It looks likely that Ms. Kelley will lose her prized honorary consul title, which she earned through local volunteerism and prolific entertaining. Reporters are camped on the couple's front yard, their friends and acquaintances are being asked for comment, their finances are being pored over, and the news coverage is relentless. Every day there seem to be new revelations.
Enter Ms. Smith. The daughter of working class parents, Ms. Smith grew up in Washington, went to Boston University and received her law degree from Washington College of Law. She was a prosecutor in the United States attorney's office in Washington when the mayor, Marion Barry, was arrested for possessing crack cocaine; it was her duty to deal with the news media tsunami when photos surfaced of the mayor with a crack pipe. That scandal prepared her well for her next position, working as special assistant and deputy press secretary for George H. W. Bush, where she helped navigate the media fallout from the Anita Hill-Clarence Thomas hearings.
It is undoubtedly this background that convinced Ms. Kelley and her husband to retain Ms. Smith in hopes of protecting their reputations. (Ms. Kelley has also hired the high-profile Washington attorney Abbe Lowell, whose clients have included Bill Clinton and John Edwards.)
So synonymous is Ms. Smith with ''crisis management'' that Shonda Rhimes, the creator of ''Grey's Anatomy,'' wrote the ABC television series ''Scandal'' based on her life. In the show, the actress Kerry Washington's character is only a slightly glamorized version of the statuesque Ms. Smith herself. Ms. Smith, who declined to speak for this article, enjoys remaining something of an enigma, and even her personal style seems designed to keep the viewer slightly off-balance, her tailored pinstriped suits juxtaposed with Beyonce-ish tresses.
Still, Washington insiders are asking, why did Ms. Kelley hire Judy Smith?
''I'm a little baffled by the whole thing,'' said Marina Ein, also a top crisis management specialist in Washington whose recent clients included Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the former chief of the International Monetary Fund and French presidential candidate accused of raping a hotel worker. (The charges were eventually dropped.) Ms. Ein wrote a letter in The Washington Post this week decrying the shaming of prized public servants for such a private matter. ''I'm really not sure why Kelley needs a crisis management person now. The way things work in D.C. is that there's a drip, drip, drip to these stories. If you wait and a few days go by, things begin to sort themselves. But we have no information yet to indicate why Kelley and her husband went in this direction.''
In ''Good Self, Bad Self,'' Ms. Smith delineates the seven character traits that can be our shining attributes -- or our downfall: ego, denial, fear, ambition, accommodation, patience, and indulgence.
It is not yet clear what cocktail of attributes have led to Ms. Kelley's experience. But however Ms. Smith sanitizes public opinion, she has a deeply calming influence on her clients at the worst moments of their lives.
The results are noteworthy. Her shepherding of Monica Lewinsky during the Kenneth Starr investigation supported her lawyers' negotiations for immunity and perhaps eased the way for speaking engagements and a book deal; after his scandal, Larry Craig held onto his senate seat (though he did not run for re-election); and Michael Vick, following his jail term and apology tour, not only returned as quarterback for the Eagles, but won back various lucrative advertising endorsements. Judy Smith doesn't just polish tainted reputations; she sells narratives of redemption. And that may be something the Kelleys can't afford to pass up.

HEADLINE: Is Rush Limbaugh's Country Gone?

BYLINE: THOMAS B. EDSALL


HIGHLIGHT: The 21st century version of class conflict sets the stage for an exceptionally bitter face-off between the left and the right in Congress 

 BODY:
The morning after the re-election of President Obama, Rush Limbaugh told his listeners:
I went to bed last night thinking we're outnumbered. I went to bed last night thinking all this discussion we'd had about this election being the election that will tell us whether or not we've lost the country. I went to bed last night thinking we've lost the country. I don't know how else you look at this.
The conservative talk show host, who had been an upbeat, if initially doubtful, Romney supporter throughout the campaign, was on a post-election downer:
In a country of children where the option is Santa Claus or work, what wins? And say what you want, but Romney did offer a vision of traditional America. In his way, he put forth a great vision of traditional America, and it was rejected. It was rejected in favor of a guy who thinks that those who are working aren't doing enough to help those who aren't. And that resonated. 
Limbaugh echoed a Republican theme that was voiced before and after the election: Barack Obama has unleashed a coalition of Americans "who are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you-name-it - that that's an entitlement. And the government should give it to them" - as Mitt Romney put it in his notorious commentary on the 47 percent.
You can find this message almost everywhere on the right side of the spectrum. The Heritage Foundation, for example, annually calculates an "Index of Dependence on Government," which grows every year:
Today, more people than ever before depend on the federal government for housing, food, income, student aid, or other assistance once considered to be the responsibility of individuals, families, neighborhoods, churches, and other civil society institutions. The United States reached another milestone in 2010: For the first time in history, half the population pays no federal income taxes. It is the conjunction of these two trends-higher spending on dependence-creating programs, and an ever-shrinking number of taxpayers who pay for these programs-that concerns those interested in the fate of the American form of government.
William Bennett, conservative stalwart, television commentator and former secretary of education under President Reagan, complained on the CNN website that Democrats have been successful in setting
the parameters and focus of the national and political dialogue as predominantly about gender, race, ethnicity and class. This is the paradigm, the template through which many Americans, probably a majority, more or less view the world, our country, and the election. It is a divisive strategy and Democrats have targeted and exploited those divides. How else can we explain that more young people now favor socialism to capitalism?
In fact, the 2011 Pew Research Center poll Bennett cites demonstrates that in many respects conservatives are right to be worried:
Not only does a plurality (49-46) of young people hold a favorable view of socialism - and, by a tiny margin (47-46), a negative view of capitalism - so do liberal Democrats, who view socialism positively by a solid 59-33; and African Americans, 55-36. Hispanics are modestly opposed, 49-44, to socialism, but they hold decisively negative attitudes toward capitalism, 55-32.
Much of the focus in the media in recent years has been on the growing hard-line stance of the Republican Party. At the same time, there are significant developments taking place as a new left alliance forms to underpin the Democratic Party. John Judis and Ruy Teixeira originally described this alliance in 2002 as the emerging Democratic majority in a pioneering book of the same name. More recently, the pollster Stan Greenberg and a group of liberal activists have described it as the "rising American electorate."
Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster who has devoted much of her work to analyzing the changing shape of the liberal and conservative coalitions, said in an email that the rising American electorate 
will have profound implications because the R.A.E. has a very different approach to the role for government, very different views on race and tolerance, different views on gender roles, and very different views on economic opportunity and security. These are some of the biggest divides in our culture.
Robert Borosage, co-director of the liberal-left Campaign for America's Future, put it more bluntly in a blog post:
In our Gilded Age of extreme inequality, with a middle class that increasingly understands the rules are rigged against them, this was the first election in what is likely to be an era of growing class warfare.
Two post-election polls - one released Nov. 14 by the Democracy Corps (founded by Stan Greenberg and James Carville), the other released Nov. 16 by the Public Religion Research Institute - reveal the decisively liberal views of the core constituencies within the rising American electorate, its support for government activism, especially measures to help the poor.
The findings from the P.R.R.I. survey are very revealing:
*When voters were asked whether cutting taxes or investing in education and infrastructure is the better policy to promote economic growth, the constituencies of the new liberal electorate consistently chose education and infrastructure by margins ranging from 2-1 to 3-2 -- African Americans by 62-33, Hispanics by 61-37, never-married men by 56-38, never-married women by 64-30, voters under 30 by 63-34, and those with post-graduate education by 60-33.
Conservative constituencies generally chose lowering taxes by strong margins - whites by 52-42, married men by 59-34, married women by 51-44, all men by 51-42; older voters between the ages of 50 and 65 by 54-42.
*The constituencies that make up the rising American electorate are firmly in favor of government action to reduce the gap between rich and poor, by 85-15 among blacks, 74-26 for Hispanics; 70-30 never-married men; 83-15 never-married women; and 76-24 among voters under 30. Conservative groups range from lukewarm to opposed: 53-47 for men; 43-57 among voters 50-65; 46-54 among married men; 52-47 among all whites.
*One of the clearest divides between the rising American electorate and the rest of the country is in responses to the statement "Government is providing too many social services that should be left to religious groups and private charities. Black disagree 77-32; Hispanics disagree 57-40; never-married women 70-27; never-married men, 59-41; young voters, 66-34; and post-grad, 65-34. Conversely, whites agree with the statement 55-44; married men agree, 60-39; married women, 55-44; all men, 55-43.
The Democracy Corps survey specifically broke out the collective views of the liberal alliance and contrasted them with the views of those on the right. Some findings:
*By a margin of 60-13, voters on the left side of the spectrum favor raising taxes on incomes above $1 million, while voters outside of the left are much less supportive, 39-25. In the case of raising the minimum wage, the left backs a hike by an overwhelming 64-6 margin, while those on the right are far less supportive, 32-18. The rising American electorate backs raising the minimum wage by 64-6, while the people outside it back a hike by just 32-18. The left coalition supports a carbon tax or fee by 43-14 while right-leaning voters are opposed, 37-24.
Policies supported by the rising American electorate - which closely overlaps with the Obama coalition - provoke intense opposition from the right. In the aftermath of the election, Romney blamed his defeat on the "gifts" Obama handed out to "the African-American community, the Hispanic community and young people."
In fact, the rising American electorate represents a direct threat to the striking array of government benefits for the affluent that the conservative movement has won over the past 40 years. These include the reduction of the top income tax rate from 50 percent in 1986 to 35 percent; the 15 percent tax rate on dividend and capital gains income, which was 39.9 percent in 1977; the lowering of the top estate tax rate from 70 percent in 1981, with just $175,000 exempted from taxation, to a top rate of 35 percent this year with $5.1 million exempted from taxation.
At the same time, the Pew survey cited above shows the high levels of skepticism and hostility toward capitalism on the part of the emerging Democratic majority. Insofar as the liberal coalition succeeds in electing Senators and representatives who share those views, the business community will have increasing difficulty in winning approval of its deregulated market and free trade agenda.
As Obama negotiates with Republican House and Senate leaders to prevent a dive over the "fiscal cliff," he will be under strong pressure from his reinvigorated liberal supporters to take a tough stand in support of tax hikes on the well-to-do and to more firmly limit spending cuts.
"Looking ahead to their post-election agenda, this is not a group looking for 'austerity,' " the Democracy Corps wrote in a report accompanying its post-election survey. "Indeed, their issues are explicitly progressive and investment-oriented," in terms of human capital. The report went on:
The rising American electorate's most important priority for the president and the Congress is "investing in education," followed by "protecting Social Security and Medicare."
In effect, the 21st century version of class conflict sets the stage for an exceptionally bitter face-off between the left and the right in Congress. The national government is facing the prospect of forced austerity, weighing such zero-sum choices as raising capital gains taxes or cutting food stamps, slashing defense spending or restricting unemployment benefits, establishing a 15 cents-a-gallon gasoline tax or pushing citizens off the Medicaid rolls, pushing central bank policy favorable to the financial services industry or curtailing Medicare eligibility.
In broader terms, the political confrontation pits taxpayers, who now form the core of the center-right coalition, against tax consumers who form the core of the center-left. According to the Tax Policy Center, 46.4 percent of all tax filers had no federal income tax liability in 2011 (although most people pay a combination of state, sales, excise, property and other levies).There are clear exceptions to this dichotomy, as many Social Security and Medicare beneficiaries (tax recipients) vote Republican, and many college-educated upper-income citizens of all races and ethnicities (tax payers) vote Democratic. Nonetheless, the overarching division remains, and the battle lines are drawn over how to distribute the costs of the looming fiscal crisis. The outcome of this policy fight will determine whether Limbaugh is correct to fear that his side has "lost the country."
 Thomas B. Edsall, a professor of journalism at Columbia University, is the author of the book "The Age of Austerity: How Scarcity Will Remake American Politics," which was published earlier this year. 
 This is the last column in the 2012 edition of Campaign Stops. We began on a Sunday a year before the election with a piece by Thomas B. Edsall on how politics look when governments don't have enough money. We end today with another piece by Mr. Edsall on the rising American electorate that returned President Obama to the White House. In between we have published hundreds of pieces - by feminist political scientists, conservative historians, demographically oriented statisticians, political theorists, religious thinkers and many others, including one every week by the Op-Ed columnists Charles M. Blow and Ross Douthat. Mr. Blow and Mr. Douthat will continue to write their print columns on the weekend and to be a major presence online during the week. Tom Edsall will remain with the Times as a weekly online columnist after he takes a well-deserved rest (his contributions to Campaign Stops totaled almost 100,000 words). Campaign Stops also published more than 95,000 comments from its passionate readers, some of whom could be columnists themselves - a huge benefit of the kind of open format that the web provides. We'll be back in 2015, ready to debate the issues that have driven American political history since the beginning, but we are also eager to find out what fresh developments we'll be talking about that we can't anticipate now.

HEADLINE: To Reduce Inequality, Tax Wealth, Not Income

BYLINE: By DANIEL ALTMAN. 
Daniel Altman, an adjunct associate professor of economics at the New York University Stern School of Business and a former member of the New York Times editorial board, is writing a book about what would happen if the United States defaulted on its debts.

 BODY:
WHETHER you're in the 99 percent, the 47 percent or the 1 percent, inequality in America may threaten your future. Often decried for moral or social reasons, inequality imperils the economy, too; the International Monetary Fund recently warned that high income inequality could damage a country's long-term growth. But the real menace for our long-term prosperity is not income inequality -- it's wealth inequality, which distorts access to economic opportunities.
Wealth inequality has worsened for two decades and is now at an extreme level. Replacing the income, estate and gift taxes with a progressive wealth tax would do much more to reduce it than any other tax plan being considered in Washington.
When economists try to measure inequality, they typically focus on income, because the data are most readily accessible. But income is not always a good gauge of economic power. Consider a group of people who all have high incomes but differ widely in their wealth. Who's going to get into the country club? Who's going to have the money to finance a new venture? Moreover, income data may not reveal the true economic power of people who are retired, or who receive their pay in securities like stocks and options or use complex strategies to avoid taxes. 
Trends in the distribution of wealth can look very different from trends in incomes, because wealth is a measure of accumulated assets, not a flow over time. High earners add much more to their wealth every year than low earners. Over time, wealth inequality rises even as income inequality stays the same, and wealth inequality eventually becomes much more severe.
This is exactly what happened in the United States. A common statistical measure of inequality is the Gini coefficient, a number between 0 and 100 that rises with greater disparities. From the late 1970s through the early 1990s, the Census Bureau recorded Gini coefficients for income in the low 40s. Yet by 1992, the Gini coefficient for wealth had risen into the mid-70s, according to data from the Federal Reserve.
Since then, it has risen steadily, to about 80 as of 2010. In 1992, the top tenth of the population controlled 20 times the wealth controlled by the bottom half. By 2010, it was 65 times. Our graduated income-tax system redistributes a small amount of money every year but does little to slow the polarization of wealth.
These are stunning changes. The global financial crisis did make a dent in the assets of the wealthiest American families, but its effects for the bottom half were utterly destructive; the number of owner-occupied homes has fallen by more than a million since 2007. People in different socioeconomic strata are living ever more different lives, with dangerous results for society: erosion of empathy, widening of rifts and undermining of meritocracy.
American household wealth totaled more than $58 trillion in 2010. A flat wealth tax of just 1.5 percent on financial assets and other wealth like housing, cars and business ownership would have been more than enough to replace all the revenue of the income, estate and gift taxes, which amounted to about $833 billion after refunds. Brackets of, say, zero percent up to $500,000 in wealth, 1 percent for wealth between $500,000 and $1 million, and 2 percent for wealth above $1 million would probably have done the trick as well.
These tax rates would garner a small portion of the extra wealth America's richest families could expect to accrue simply by investing what they already had. The rates would also be enough to slow -- if not reverse -- the increase in inequality. To see how the wealth tax would work, consider a family with $500,000 in wealth and $200,000 in annual income. Right now, they might pay $50,000 in federal income tax. With the wealth tax brackets described above, they would pay nothing. On the other hand, a family with $4 million in wealth and $200,000 in annual income would owe $65,000. Most families that depend on their wealth for their income would pay more, and most that depend on their earnings would pay less.
In fact, the majority of American families would receive an enormous tax cut. Some would owe only payroll taxes (for Social Security and Medicare) and state and local taxes every year, and others would pay less in wealth tax than they did in income tax. Taxes on earnings, capital gains, dividends and interest, all of which may distort decisions about working and investing, would disappear.
For most families, whose wealth may never reach $500,000, all disincentives to save would vanish. And families trying to accumulate a fixed amount of wealth for retirement or their children's college fund could devote less of their incomes to saving, since in most cases the wealth tax would take a smaller bite of their interest, dividends and capital gains than the current income tax. Though the remaining minority of families subject to the wealth tax might end up saving less and spending more, this shift would also reduce inequality; the dollars they spent would be more likely to end up in the pockets of people with less wealth.
Scholars have recommended a wealth tax in the past, but not as a replacement for the income, estate and gift taxes. Indeed, phasing in the new tax would present some complications. People who already paid income tax on the money they used to buy their assets would not want to pay a new tax on them. Yet a reduced wealth tax -- perhaps 1 percent in the top bracket to start -- would collect less from many of them than the current income tax.
Naturally a cottage industry would spring up to help wealthy people lessen their exposure to the new tax. The federal government would need new rules for the reporting and valuation of assets, as well as new auditing processes. Levying the tax at the family level -- perhaps parents and children up to a fixed age -- might make it harder for the wealthy to reduce their tax liability by allocating their assets among multiple family members to reduce the wealth-tax liability.
By contrast, people with wealth tied up in property and small businesses might have real trouble coming up with enough cash to pay the tax. This is a problem that can be solved, or at least mitigated, by making payment periods flexible over several years. In addition, new financial products could offer cash for tax payments, either as loans or in return for partial ownership of assets -- much like home equity loans do today.
States with income taxes would have to decide whether to switch to the wealth tax. Because some states collect tax from commuters who work within their borders but live elsewhere, an income tax might still be attractive. Yet rather than having two systems, it might be better to apportion state wealth taxes between the states where families live and work.
The benefits of the wealth tax would make these adjustments worthwhile. The economy would allocate opportunities more equitably and efficiently, and the tax system would become simpler. It would help working class people to realize their potential and ensure that society did not become unduly polarized. Of course, we can do much more to improve access to opportunity for all Americans. But a wealth tax would be a good place to start.

HEADLINE: Vote for French Opposition Leader Raises Tensions

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER and NICOLA CLARK

 BODY:
PARIS -- A vote to choose the next leader of France's center-right opposition party was considered too close to call early Monday morning, and there were angry charges of electoral fraud.
The party, the Union for a Popular Movement, faced a choice between two men of very different styles: Franois Fillon, the elegant prime minister under President Nicolas Sarkozy, who was defeated for re-election six months ago, and Jean-Franois Cop, a firebrand 10 years younger than Mr. Fillon who is the acting party leader. Some 300,000 party members were entitled to vote in 650 different polling places, and partial results late on Sunday showed Mr. Cop with a narrow lead.
Both men claimed victory, and the closeness of the result will not help the party find a clear direction. 
Mr. Sarkozy's defeat badly bruised the party, known as the U.M.P. for its initials in French, and it was followed by defeat in legislative elections in June. Now, much like the Republican Party in the United States, the U.M.P. faces difficult choices as it tries to redefine itself and work through a crisis of identity.
Its one advantage now is that the Socialist government of Franois Hollande, who replaced Mr. Sarkozy, is already declining in popularity as it struggles to rein in the nation's budget deficit and avert a recession.
In essence, the U.M.P. must decide whether it will remain the political heir to the party founded by Charles de Gaulle after World War II, or will move to the right in the face of a challenge from the far-right National Front.
Mr. Fillon, 58, is a traditional conservative who, as prime minister, managed to remain personally popular even as his hyperactive boss sank in opinion polls. Quiet and urbane, and a touch dull, he has tried to steer the party toward the center, hoping to attract voters who opted to support Mr. Hollande for president but who are already growing disillusioned with his performance.
Mr. Cop, 48, generally shares Mr. Fillon's views on economic policy and Europe. But as a legislator and mayor of Meaux, northeast of Paris, he has been decidedly more provocative in his statements. He has also been unabashed in his efforts to woo voters from the National Front, whose strong showing at the polls this year split the conservative vote, sealing Mr. Sarkozy's fate as the country's first one-term president in three decades.
Mr. Cop describes himself as a ''nonpracticing Jew'' whose mother was born in Algeria and whose paternal grandfather immigrated from Romania. Some see him as a man in the Sarkozy mold, supporting the former president's tough policies on immigration and the role of Islam in French society. But critics call him ''Sarkozy lite.''
During the campaign, Mr. Cop -- a driving force behind a 2011 law that banned the wearing of the burqa, or full veil, in public -- adopted a more divisive tone, focusing on themes like stricter immigration laws and the reinforcement of France's secularism, as a not-so-subtle response to fears of radical Islam.
Last month, in ''A Manifesto for an Uninhibited Right,'' Mr. Cop wrote that the suburbs of France's biggest cities had become bastions of ''anti-white racism,'' a term much discussed and mocked in the French news media. He later used his Twitter account to relay an anecdote about a child who had been robbed of a chocolate pastry by ''thugs'' who were said to be enforcing the Ramadan fast. The remarks prompted outrage on the left and produced cringing among some U.M.P. members.
''All these little phrases are toxic and dangerous,'' said Franois Baroin, a former Sarkozy finance minister and a supporter of Mr. Fillon. Benoist Apparu, a former junior minister, concurred. ''Such positions weaken our political family,'' he said.
Others disagreed.
''He speaks the truth about these things that others are afraid to say,'' said Nadine Morano, a former minister close to Mr. Sarkozy who backed Mr. Cop. His frankness is especially appealing to ''exasperated'' young conservatives, she said. ''They are very attached to the language of the truth.''
For Marine Le Pen, the leader of the National Front, Mr. Cop's strategy was an admission that party leaders are out of touch. ''The U.M.P. rank and file feels much closer to our positions than to those of the U.M.P. leadership,'' she said in a radio interview. ''Mr. Cop is chasing after his base.''
This election will give analysts ''a sense of the balance of power,'' said Bruno Cautrs, a public opinion specialist at the Center for Political Research at the Institut d'tudes Politiques, or Sciences Po. ''It will determine their electoral strategy -- not only for 2017, but for interim elections in 2014.''
After losing the presidency and both houses of the legislature in June, the party is now focusing on local and municipal elections scheduled in just over a year's time. Local government is dominated by the left now, but with Mr. Hollande's government struggling, analysts suggested that the right could make real gains.
Regardless of who becomes the leader of the party, the U.M.P. is likely to continue its delicate dance with far-right voters while avoiding any outright alliance with the National Front. ''Marine Le Pen is young; she's only 43 years old,'' Mr. Cautrs said. ''The French right will have to deal with her for some time.''
Both Mr. Fillon and Mr. Cop reject any partnership with the National Front, a move that would be considered politically suicidal.
The U.M.P. is already displaying some nostalgia for Mr. Sarkozy, 57. After a summer spent on the beaches of Morocco and southern France, he began a series of public appearances that seemed choreographed to keep him in the picture for the presidential race in 2017.
The French news media has seemed only happy to oblige him: ''Yoo-hoo! I'm back!'' was the headline on a recent cover of the magazine Le Point, over a photo of Mr. Sarkozy.
''Like any president who has been beaten -- especially after only one term, and so narrowly -- he dreams of revenge,'' Mr. Cautrs said. ''Officially, he makes it seem like he has turned the page, that he lives another life. But that is a complete fantasy.''

HEADLINE: Freewheeling Afghan City Fearful of U.S. Pullout

BYLINE: By GRAHAM BOWLEY; Habib Zahori contributed reporting.

 BODY:
HERAT, Afghanistan -- Women in Converse sneakers jog untrammeled -- if still in full, flowing chadors -- in this western Afghan city's biggest park, enjoying freedoms rarely witnessed in the rest of Afghanistan.
Rich businessmen, refugees for a few days of ''picnic'' from more violent Kandahar, pull on apple-scented shisha pipes like lotus eaters in the pagodas of the local pleasure garden. Unwary for once of kidnappers or suicide bombers, they punctuate the night with hoots of laughter.
Herat, an ancient trading city of minarets and wide avenues in the brown borderlands of western Afghanistan, has probably advanced further than any other in this country toward modernity over the past 10 years. There is a quiet and firm belief here that if any place can ride out the coming economic and security turbulence as international forces and money depart, it will be this city.
Yet there are still whispers of encroaching violence, tremors of economic downturn, calls by a local strongman to rearm against the Taliban, conservative opposition to modernization -- and doubt. 
''War will start,'' said Ghulam Reza, a slight man with a gray beard and turban, an old mujahedeen fighter who had brought his two grown-up daughters and their husbands to the Citadel, one of Herat's landmarks.
He wanted them to see how much the hulking battlements had been restored with, in large part, a $1.2 million grant from the United States Consulate.
He also wanted to show them where he used to fight when war stalked the city, and all of those parts were in ruins.
''Everything will go back to the early 1990s, when there was a civil war among the mujahedeen groups,'' he said, adding that there would still be hope if foreign forces stayed in large numbers.
There is the strong sense that Herat has an immense amount to lose.
The source of the city's prosperity is not hard to see -- the snaking road from the Iranian border 80 miles away runs to the dusty 200-acre customs yard on the edge of town. There, beneath brown hills chalked with ''Allahu akbar'' and ''My love, Afghanistan,'' lumbering trucks spill German air-conditioners, Chinese motorcycle parts and Saudi honey into the Herat economy for transport to the Afghan hinterland.
Although there are attacks in the districts outside the city, the Taliban have not secured a strong foothold in Herat. And trade and proximity to Iran and Turkmenistan have bred openness and a rich urbanization of furniture stores, office towers and storied homes, some in places where dirt tracks ran just five years ago.
The city has swelled in recent years to more than a million residents, according to provincial estimates. And the life here, in the quiet paved neighborhoods, the laughter of its fairs and chatter of its soccer fields, evokes something all too rare in Afghanistan -- a people actually having fun.
But Herat is also a place where Afghan history has a tendency to splinter. It was here in 1979 that locals rose up against the Soviet-backed government, giving first momentum to a chain of uprisings that prompted the invasion and 10-year Soviet occupation of the country.
Much of the city was destroyed. In a dirty, bombed-out wasteland in the center of Herat, 600-year-old minarets still stand, barely, looking like haunted industrial smokestacks -- a reminder to the people not only of their history but also of what they should be careful not to lose again, said Ayamuddin Ajmal, head of the department for the preservation of cultural monuments.
''They are the five fingers of our history,'' said Mr. Ajmal, a sturdy man with short black hair, as he strode one morning beneath the minarets. ''They witnessed a lot. Those bullet holes are holes in our history.''
A commander who took part in the 1979 rebellion, Ismail Khan, later became governor and self-styled emir of this region, his fatherly largess evident in Herat's parks and museums.
Now, he is active again. Leaving his office in Kabul, where he serves as minister for energy and water, he returned to Herat on Nov. 1 to gather thousands of his former fighters outside the city, urging them to reactivate their networks and prepare to counter the Taliban if the national army is not up to the job. That call raised fears around the country that old dividing lines were again becoming active among the network of mujahedeen warlords who waged the civil war.
Worries about a return to the bad old days here and elsewhere in Afghanistan have cast a pall over Herat, contributing to a weakening of its lifeblood -- trade -- as the 2014 troop withdrawal approaches.
Annual economic growth has slipped from 20 percent in 2011 to about 10 percent, according to the Chamber of Commerce and Industries. And restrictions on trade through Iran and a slowing of that economy next door are also making things worse, locals say.
Out in the warehouses of the Shahab motorcycle factory in an industrial park near the airport, production has dropped from 400 bikes a day to 100, and the manager, Halim Shah Haideri, was forced to lay off half of the 150 workers. Mr. Haideri, 50, burst into sudden pessimism: ''There will be a war, definitely.''
This pessimism has nurtured a sense of siege even in those areas where Herat has made the most social and cultural progress, like women's rights and the media.
Herat boasts some of the highest levels of education for girls, and Afghanistan's only female provincial chief prosecutor.
But the prosecutor, Maria Bashir, receives monthly notifications ''of Taliban plots to attack me,'' she said, sitting in her defended office in the government compound. ''It is very difficult for them to accept that a woman should be in a decision-making position.''
Not far away, in one of Herat's more expensive neighborhoods, Sayed Wahid Qattali, a young, well-connected businessman from a prosperous family, rented a house for $1,500 a month, built a studio and this month began Herat's newest television station, Asar, or Time, which he describes as pro-democratic. He also started a radio station focused solely on women and their issues.
Both stations celebrate new freedoms won over the last decade. But the way he describes them, they are also weapons crucial now to defending those freedoms against the country's enemies.
''I am trying to protect all these values,'' Mr. Qattali said.
The competition includes rival cable channels in Herat -- backed, he said, by Iran and Pakistan, and occupied with disseminating their propaganda. Those two neighbors loom large in almost every Afghan's fears about who will determine the country's fate once the United States leaves.
''We are against Talibanization,'' Mr. Qattali said. ''We are against the influence of Iran and Pakistan, who are supporting fundamentalism in the region.''
Later, in the sprawling park known as the Takht-e-Safar gardens -- one of Ismail Khan's legacies -- children swirled in flying chairs at a creaky multicolored fun fair. As traditional music pulsed through a loudspeaker, they howled and kicked, still able to enjoy the openness of their sparkling city below.
But Mohammad Hares, a 19-year-old law student, wearing brown, traditional shalwar kameez and eating potato chips in the shadows of the pine trees, worried how long it would last.
''Recently there has been some security incidents in Herat city, and in the districts -- assassinations, kidnappings -- which have made Heratis very concerned,'' he said, watching another ride, the Big Wheel, as men and women together were lifted up in blue, red and green buckets toward the sunset.
''I remember the Taliban times,'' he said, ''and I hope Afghanistan will be free so that the kids can continue with their education and go to school.''

HEADLINE: Change in Negotiators Shakes Up U.S.-China Trade Policy

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
BEIJING -- The rare congruity of the political calendars in the United States and China, with both countries choosing leaders this month, is about to produce an equally rare replacement of most of each side's senior trade negotiators, with unpredictable results for bilateral economic relations.
One of the few surprises in the carefully scripted Communist Party Congress that ended on Wednesday was that Commerce Minister Chen Deming lost his seat when delegates chose the members of the party's Central Committee for the next five years. 
Under party rules, that means he will have to step down as minister at the National People's Congress in March. His demotion also meant that he was ineligible to join the Politburo last Thursday and become one of the four vice prime ministers, as some analysts had expected.
Some Chinese analysts say that the direction of the country's international economic policy is clear and consistent, and that changing the individuals responsible for carrying out that policy will not make much difference.
''The fundamental policy on international trade is adherence to opening and reform,'' said He Weiwen, the co-director of the China-U.S./E.U. Study Center at the China Association of International Trade in Beijing. ''It will certainly continue and develop to a new height, including China's trade policy on the U.S.''
But the significance of Mr. Chen's departure from the Central Committee, which has 205 members and 171 alternates, has divided Western experts about what it means for China's policies. He has a reputation as a gentlemanly figure who chooses his words with care and has not indulged in outspoken denunciations of the West during trade disputes, even as the tone of social media in China has become increasingly nationalistic on economic policy.
Mr. Chen's failure to win broad support from the party delegates ''does not bode well for future trade relations, and shows that China is pushed by populism,'' warned one Western expert who insisted on anonymity because of China's sensitivity about discussions of personnel changes.
But others cautioned that Mr. Chen had been quick to retaliate for American and European trade actions instead of seeking to negotiate solutions, so his presence at the Commerce Ministry may not have acted as much of a brake on China's willingness to confront its trading partners.
Most recently, Mr. Chen had started a series of trade actions against imports of the main raw material for solar panels, polysilicon, to retaliate for the stiff American tariffs on Chinese solar panels and European consideration of similar tariffs.
Mr. Chen had been criticized within China's bureaucracy for falling short on all three of China's top trade priorities with the European Union: ending the European embargo on arms exports to China, winning ''market economy'' status from the European Union to discourage antidumping cases against Chinese exports, and discouraging European officials against starting a trade case over solar panels.
According to the state news media, there were only 9.3 percent more candidates for the Central Committee than seats available.
The Chinese government did not release the names of the losing candidates, and it is possible that Mr. Chen's name was not on the final ballot; he is 63 and approaching retirement. But several people said they were under the impression that Mr. Chen had failed to win.
Mr. Chen's mercurial predecessor as commerce minister, Bo Xilai, did join the Politburo at the end of his term as minister in 2007, but was purged last spring and is now awaiting trial on various accusations relating to abuse of power.
There are two leading candidates to become the next commerce minister, a job with responsibilities that roughly combine those held separately in the United States by the trade representative and the under secretary of commerce for international trade. One of the contenders is Gao Hucheng, Mr. Chen's deputy at the Commerce Ministry, and the other is Huang Xingguo, the mayor of Tianjin.
Little is known about their views on trade policy.
Mr. Gao has been seen for years as a successor to Mr. Chen, but Mr. Huang may benefit from the recent promotion of his boss, Zhang Gaoli, who holds the top job in Tianjin as party secretary. Mr. Zhang became one of the seven members of the ruling Politburo Standing Committee on Thursday and is expected to become the executive vice premier overseeing day-to-day economic policy at the National People's Congress in March.
Two other prominent Chinese officials involved in bilateral relations are leaving their posts. Wang Qishan, the vice prime minister who has led the Chinese economic policy negotiating teams for nearly five years, became a member of the Politburo Standing Committee but was named to lead the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, which means that he will focus on corruption investigations.
Zhou Xiaochuan, the governor of China's Central Bank for the past decade, is retiring and was not re-elected to the Central Committee.
In the United States, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner and Ron Kirk, the trade representative, are all expected to leave at the end of President Obama's first term.

HEADLINE: Tisch School of Arts to Close Singapore School

BYLINE: By KRISTIANO ANG

 BODY:
New York arts school closing Singapore campus
Facing budgetary problems, Tisch Asia , the Singapore campus of New York University's Tisch School of Arts, has announced that it will cease operations. 
''Tisch Asia has been a model of artistic and academic excellence, but it has also faced significant financial challenges that have required increasingly unsustainable subsidies,'' Mary Schmidt Campbell, Tisch's dean, said in a statement this month.
She said that Tisch would have given its Singapore subsidiary a cumulative total of more than 30 million Singapore dollars, or about $24.5 million, by September 2013.
The Singapore news media have reported that Tisch Asia also received financial assistance from the Singapore Economic Development Board, a state-affiliated investment promotion agency.
The Singapore school, which only offers M.F.A. degrees, opened with high hopes in 2007. The Economic Development Board had lured Tisch to Singapore to help turn the city-state into an education hub. The film director Oliver Stone served for a time as the school's artistic director.
Tisch said that the Singapore campus would not cease operations before summer 2014 and that students who could not finish their coursework by that time could do so at N.Y.U. sites around the world. The university also has a campus in Abu Dhabi.

Section of library renamed to honor school's donor
The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology has renamed a portion of its library for Chevalier International Holdings, after its chairman, Chow Yei-ching, donated 20 million Hong Kong dollars to the school.
The Chevalier Learning Commons, which is currently open 22 hours a day, is planned to be open 24 hours a day during the next exam period in December, said Brenda Yau, a university spokeswoman. The Commons is a newly renovated section with multimedia tools, broadcast studios and areas where students can eat and chat. ''This is different from a traditional library area, where students are told to keep quiet,'' she said.
Dr. Chow's latest donation, which is worth $2.5 million, was announced this month. He has been supporting various projects at H.K.U.S.T. since 1993.

HEADLINE: European Countries Seek More Taxes From U.S. Multinational Companies

BYLINE: By ERIC PFANNER

 BODY:
PARIS -- Google reported sales of more than $4 billion in Britain last year. It paid less than $10 million in taxes.
Some tax collectors, lawmakers and competitors of Google in Europe say this is unfair.
As governments throughout the region seek to close gaping holes in their budgets, they are taking aim at United States multinational companies, especially Internet giants like Google and Amazon.com, which pay little or no taxes in Europe, despite generating billions of dollars in revenue on the Continent.
''Why on earth do you manipulate your accounts so that you get away with not paying corporation tax in the U.K.?'' Margaret Hodge, a member of Parliament, asked representatives of Google, Amazon and Starbucks last week, during a heated committee hearing in London.
In France, tax collectors have gone further. Amazon says it has received a bill from France for taxes and penalties related to the ''allocation of income between foreign jurisdictions'' from 2006 through 2010. Other companies, including Google, are also reportedly in the French authorities' sights. 
''Even if the Internet is a zone of freedom, it shouldn't be a lawless zone,'' Najat Vallaud-Belkacem, a spokeswoman for the French government, said last week. ''Fiscal rules should be able to be applied to those activities as well.''
Google, Amazon, Starbucks and other American companies facing tax scrutiny say they are doing nothing wrong. They use complex accounting strategies to exploit national differences across Europe in corporate tax rates, which range from less than 10 percent to more than 30 percent, and loopholes that can reduce their effective European tax levies to almost nothing.
Google, for example, records most of its international revenue at its European headquarters in Ireland, where the corporate tax rate is 12.5 percent. Across Europe, customers who buy advertising, Google's primary source of revenue, sign contracts with the company's subsidiary in Ireland, rather than with local branches.
Google ends up paying Irish taxes on only a fraction of the billions of euros that course through its Dublin office. That is because the company uses a variety of methods, including royalty payments to a unit in Bermuda, to reduce further the amount of money exposed to tax liability.
So, while Google told the Securities and Exchange Commission that it generated more than $4 billion in sales in Britain last year, it reported revenue of only 396 million, or $629 million, in its official filings there. The total, the company said, reflected the amount that Google's British unit billed Google Ireland for promotional work, consulting and other activities. Google declared a profit of 31 million in Britain, resulting in a British tax bill of only 6 million.
''We pay the tax we are required to pay in every country in which we operate,'' Matt Brittin, Google vice president for North and Central Europe, told the parliamentary panel.
Ms. Hodge, chairwoman of the Public Accounts Committee, acknowledged that she thought Google, Amazon and Starbucks were probably complying with the law. ''We are not accusing you of being illegal, we are accusing you of being immoral,'' she said.
In France, more than morality is at stake. In his testimony to the parliamentary panel, Andrew Cecil, director of public policy for Amazon in Europe, confirmed that the company had received a demand for $252 million from the French tax collection agency. He said Amazon was contesting the claim, which was originally disclosed in an American regulatory filing.
Amazon, which has European headquarters in Luxembourg, another small country with favorable tax conditions for multinational companies, reported 9.1 billion euros, or $11.6 billion, in revenue across Europe last year. It posted an after-tax profit of 20 million euros on those sales, and paid about 8 million euros in tax, Mr. Cecil said.
Mr. Cecil told the parliamentary committee that when customers across Europe bought books from Amazon, they were actually buying them from the Luxembourg-based Amazon entity, rather than their local subsidiaries. That response was met with incredulity by Ms. Hodge, who noted that when she ordered a book from the company, she used a British Web site, Amazon.co.uk, and the goods were delivered from a British warehouse via the British Royal Mail.
News reports in France note that French fiscal authorities are also seeking back taxes and penalties from Google, amounting to 1.7 billion euros. Ms. Vallaud-Belkacem told reporters that she could not comment on individual companies for privacy reasons. Google, in a statement, said the reports were premature.
''Google has not received any tax assessment from the French tax administration,'' the company said. ''We have and will continue to cooperate with the authorities in France.''
Europe is not the only place where the complex tax arrangements of United States multinationals are being questioned. The authorities in Australia have sent Apple a bill for 28.5 million Australian dollars, or about $29.5 million, in back taxes, according to news reports Friday. Apple could not be reached for comment.
In an era of globalization, determining the tax liability of multinational companies has long vexed policy makers and tax collectors. International agreements generally state that commerce should be taxed in the physical location where profit-making activity occurs, not necessarily where a customer is based or where a transaction takes place.
Determining the appropriate jurisdiction for taxation is especially difficult with Internet businesses, because of the intangible nature of many of the goods and services that change hands and the ease with which transactions can cross borders.
Google says that most of the economic value it creates is generated in Silicon Valley, where its engineers toil away at the computer algorithms behind its search engine and other services. So the company says it is fair that most of what it pays in taxes goes to the United States Treasury, not its foreign counterparts.
While Google's United States taxes have come under scrutiny, too, the company pays substantially more in the United States. In 2011, the company's annual report shows, it made a provision of $2.6 billion for income taxes, all but $248 million of that going to the state and national treasuries in the United States. Based on pretax income of $12.3 billion, that amounted to an effective rate of 21 percent.
''If Google was a British business, if Google had been founded in Cambridge by Larry and Sergey, I think we'd be in a very different place here, because the profitability would rightly sit where all the technology and innovation take place, which is not here,'' Mr. Brittin said. He was referring to Larry Page and Sergey Brin, the co-founders of Google.
Though Google employees across Europe advise clients on the use of the company's services, advertisers sign contracts with the company's subsidiary in Ireland. This has shielded Google from tax liability in France, Britain and other European countries, at least so far.
''Google is saying, 'We just float around freely above this useful aircraft carrier, Ireland,' '' said Richard Murphy, founder of the Tax Justice Network, an independent organization that campaigns against what it calls tax ''loopholes and distortions.'' ''What France is saying is, 'We don't think you float around over Ireland, we think you are in France.' ''
If Google believes that its profit-making activity -- that is, its taxable work -- occurs in the United States, Mr. Murphy said, then it ought to take its European earnings home and expose them to the Internal Revenue Service. Yet, like many other American multinationals, it has been reluctant to do so.
Instead, Google said it had accumulated $24.8 billion as of the end of 2011 outside the United States -- part of a cache of stored American corporate cash that Citizens for Tax Justice, an American advocacy group, estimates at more than $1.5 trillion. The money has been accumulating in Bermuda and other offshore havens since a 2004 United States tax holiday for the repatriation of corporate profits.
While some American corporate leaders have been lobbying in Washington for another tax holiday, lawmakers in Europe are moving to collect a greater share of multinationals' taxes.
Last spring, the European Parliament threw its support behind a proposal to create a single set of European Union-wide accounting rules for calculating multinational corporations' tax liabilities. But policy makers are divided over whether the standards should be voluntary or mandatory.
Ms. Vallaud-Belkacem said last week that the administration of President Franois Hollande of France was discussing with other European governments ways to crack down on tax avoidance by international companies.
After a meeting this month, George Osborne, the British chancellor of the Exchequer, and Finance Minister Wolfgang Schuble of Germany called for ''concerted international cooperation to strengthen international standards for corporate tax regimes.''
Mr. Osborne said in a statement, ''We want competitive taxes that say Britain is open for business and that attract global companies to invest in and bring jobs to our country, but we also want global companies to pay those taxes.''

HEADLINE: Opportunists Stockpile Twinkies for Big Payday

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
SAN FRANCISCO -- Twinkies are being sold on the Internet like delicacies.
Hours after the maker of Twinkies, Hostess Brands, announced its plans to close forever, people flocked to stores to fill their shopping baskets with boxes of Twinkies, which are cream-filled sponge cakes, and other snacks made by the company -- Ding Dongs, Ho Hos and Zingers. 
Late Friday and Saturday, the opportunists took to the Web sites eBay and Craigslist. They began marketing their hoards to whimsical collectors and junk-food lovers for hundreds, in some cases thousands, of dollars. That is a fat profit margin, considering the retail price for a box of 10 Twinkies is about $5.
Greg Edmonds of Sherman, Texas, is among those who believe Twinkies are worth more now that Hostess has closed its bakeries. He lost his job as a sales representative eight months ago, so he is hoping to make some money feeding the appetites of Twinkie fans and connoisseurs.
After spending a couple of hours driving around to stores Friday, Mr. Edmonds wound up with 16 boxes of Twinkies and Ding Dongs. He started selling them Saturday on eBay, advertising three boxes for a hefty price of $300.
''I could really use the extra money, since I'm unemployed,'' said Mr. Edmonds, 50. ''I figure I better sell them pretty quickly, because I am not sure how long this novelty is going to last.''
Contrary to popular belief, Twinkies do not last forever. Most bought in stores Friday carry an expiration date of early December.
If buyers do not bite, Mr. Edmonds is not sure what he will do with his supply. He does not even like Twinkies.
''I do like to have a Ding Dong every once in a while though,'' he said.
John Stansel of Tampa, Florida, blanches at the thought of eating a Twinkie. He is a self-described health nut.
Yet he, too, rummaged shelves late Friday and early Saturday at three local stores. He spent about $100 for 20 boxes of Twinkies and Ding Dongs. His goal: Sell them for about $1,000 and put the money to good use.
''Maybe I will hire a personal trainer for myself or go do some shopping at Whole Foods or donate the money to a charity to fight diabetes,'' said Mr. Stansel, 40. ''No matter what, I figure I am getting sugar off the streets.''
Although Hostess is shutting down, it is still possible that Twinkies, Ding Dongs and Ho Hos could make a comeback.
That is because Hostess is planning to sell its brands and other assets at an auction to be overseen by a U.S. bankruptcy judge in New York. Several potential buyers could emerge for Twinkies, particularly after the recent outpouring of affection.
A hearing on Hostess's liquidation request is scheduled for Monday morning.
Not all online sellers are demanding top dollar. Some boxes are being listed at $5 to $20. Others are willing to barter. ''I am willing to trade a box for some good microbrew. A real quality six pack,'' offered a thirsty seller in New York on Craigslist.
Despite his disdain for junk food, Mr. Stansel said he would not sell a few of his individually wrapped Twinkies.
He plans to give them to his nostalgic friends and family members as stocking stuffers for Christmas.

HEADLINE: Honey, I Shrunk the Pentagon

BYLINE: By BILL KELLER

 BODY:
LET'S imagine you are the new secretary of defense, and, wow, has Secretary Panetta left you a full docket. You have to extract more than 60,000 troops from Afghanistan without leaving behind a Mad Max dystopia. You have to carry on shadow wars against homicidal extremists, refine contingency plans for Syria and Iran, keep an eye on China's pushiness and Pakistan's fragility, all without being too distracted by the frat-house antics of hormonal generals.
It's easy to overlook in all that excitement, but your best opportunity to make a major contribution to the security of your country is none of the above. It is the unglamorous, unpopular, unfinished business of right-sizing our defense budget, without putting us at grave risk. What's that you say? You'd rather go back to reading General Petraeus's flirty e-mails? I sympathize. Imagine trying to get people to read a column about the budget. 
Yet here you are with a historic opportunity to push the ''Refresh'' button on our national security. One long ground war is over, another is ending, and there is no prospect of (or stomach for) new wars of occupation. No new cosmic threat has arisen, much as hawks have tried to promote China, our biggest lender and one of our biggest trading partners, into that role. And, to cap it all, your budget is headed for that dread fiscal cliff. In the absence of a budget bargain between Congress and the president, half of the automatic spending cuts that take effect in January will come from your domain -- almost 10 percent applied evenly across all accounts. This is widely viewed with alarm by military experts in both parties who see it, rightly, as budgeting by meat ax. So, then, what's the alternative?
This country accounts for more than 40 percent of the money spent on defense worldwide. We spend as much as the next 14 countries on the top-spender list, combined, and most of them are American allies. And that's just the Defense Department. It doesn't include the Energy Department's nuclear weapons program, the C.I.A.'s drone franchise, the NASA satellites, the benefits provided by Veterans Affairs, and so on.
For defense conservatives, reinforced by members of Congress whose constituents build ships and aircraft, there is no such thing as enough. The determination to maintain our commanding position in a dangerous world is inflated by the clout of arms makers and sanctified by our civilian reflex to call everyone in uniform ''hero.'' (No one who actually wears a uniform does that.)
For liberals, the defense budget is invariably too much, a deep aquifer of wealth that should be tapped to quench our domestic thirsts. When liberals are in power, though, they tend to recoil from serious cost-cutting, partly for fear of seeming weak, partly because no one wants to be picketed by the shipbuilders' union, but largely because, from where a commander in chief sits, the world is a genuinely scary place. In his re-election campaign, President Obama was largely silent on military spending, except for his sarcastic retort about bayonets and horses when Mitt Romney complained that we have fewer battleships than we used to.
But the economic crisis has chipped away at Defense's defenses. Early this year, in conformity with a budget directive from Congress, Panetta proposed a budget that would cut $487 billion -- about 8 percent -- from planned defense spending over 10 years. The fiscal cliff, known to defense wonks as ''sequestration,'' would cut an additional $492 billion.
Most of the experts I follow think defense can be safely cut below Panetta's level. How much? David Barno, a retired Army lieutenant general, and his colleagues at the Center for a New American Security last year laid out four increasingly severe budget-cutting scenarios in a very readable and, to my mind, credible report called ''Hard Choices: Responsible Defense in an Age of Austerity.'' Barno told me he could live with the second option (''Constrained Global Presence''), which cuts between $150 billion and $200 billion deeper than Panetta over 10 years. Barno estimates that additional ''tens of billions, conservatively'' could be saved by tightening the generous health and retirement benefits for military personnel and reforming the way we acquire new weapons. The bipartisan Simpson-Bowles fiscal commission recommended cuts in the same range. A new report from a defense panel assembled by the Stimson Center says that if the military is given flexibility to apportion the cuts where they will do the least harm, we can cut $550 billion -- about the same amount as sequestration -- ''with acceptable levels of risk.'' The centrist think tank Third Way recommends the same. These people are not reckless anti-military types or Ron Paul isolationists.
None of these cuts would absolve us of the need to grapple with the unsustainable growth of entitlements and to raise tax revenues. But making defense pay its share would make those other economies less painful. And after all, as Adm. Mike Mullen, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs, was fond of saying, ''The single biggest threat to our national security is our debt.''
Budget discipline might finally force the Defense Department to make strategic choices and systemic reforms that are worth doing on the merits. Over the years, think tanks within the military and without have produced an immense, rich literature on how to make prudent sense out of austerity.
Almost everyone starts with a significant cut in active-duty ground forces and the heavy vehicles and artillery that go with them. Keeping America and its allies safe these days depends more on our formidable array of ships, aircraft and precision-guided munitions, plus small units of highly trained special ops and drones to combat terrorist cells. With the cold war over, we can afford to slash nuclear arsenals without diminishing our deterrent.
On a tighter allowance, the services might learn to behave as if they were playing for the same side. ''All four services currently operate their own air forces, with limited sharing of aircraft,'' the Barno report reminds us. The smallest service, the Marine Corps, has more tanks, artillery and fixed-wing aircraft than the entire British military. The services have a multiplicity of headquarters, on the principle that generals have to command something.
Our military should invest heavily in research and development of breakthrough technologies, like unmanned aircraft, but resist the lure of gold-plated, highly specialized weapons that often overpromise and don't deliver. The Pentagon should curtail the practice of no-compete contracts. Frank Hoffman a senior research fellow at the National Defense University, recalled that he recently replaced a stolen Sony computer with the same model for half the price and got double the battery life. ''That does not happen in the defense business,'' he wrote. ''We replace airplanes, helicopters and trucks at five times the cost, and buy far fewer because of it.''
None of this is new thinking. The last secretary of defense who called for a postwar transformation of the military was Donald Rumsfeld. He arrived at the Pentagon in 2001 for his second tour with an insider's understanding of the system, a C.E.O.'s impatience with inefficiency, and an awareness that the end of the cold war presented a different world of threats. He was not a budget-cutter, but he wanted the money spent well. Before his good intentions got lost in the slogs of Afghanistan and Iraq, he railed at the interservice rivalries, the waste, the reluctance to give up anything or think afresh.
About four months into the job he dashed off one of his famous notes: ''It is hard to imagine how a collection of such talented, intelligent, honorable, dedicated, patriotic people, who care about the security of the U.S. and the men and women of the armed forces, could have combined to produce such a mess. And yet, they conclude that nothing should be done to clean up the mess.''
Maybe now they'll have no choice.

HEADLINE: The Twinkie Manifesto

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
The Twinkie, it turns out, was introduced way back in 1930. In our memories, however, the iconic snack will forever be identified with the 1950s, when Hostess popularized the brand by sponsoring ''The Howdy Doody Show.'' And the demise of Hostess has unleashed a wave of baby boomer nostalgia for a seemingly more innocent time.
Needless to say, it wasn't really innocent. But the '50s -- the Twinkie Era -- do offer lessons that remain relevant in the 21st century. Above all, the success of the postwar American economy demonstrates that, contrary to today's conservative orthodoxy, you can have prosperity without demeaning workers and coddling the rich. 
Consider the question of tax rates on the wealthy. The modern American right, and much of the alleged center, is obsessed with the notion that low tax rates at the top are essential to growth. Remember that Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson, charged with producing a plan to curb deficits, nonetheless somehow ended up listing ''lower tax rates'' as a ''guiding principle.''
Yet in the 1950s incomes in the top bracket faced a marginal tax rate of 91, that's right, 91 percent, while taxes on corporate profits were twice as large, relative to national income, as in recent years. The best estimates suggest that circa 1960 the top 0.01 percent of Americans paid an effective federal tax rate of more than 70 percent, twice what they pay today.
Nor were high taxes the only burden wealthy businessmen had to bear. They also faced a labor force with a degree of bargaining power hard to imagine today. In 1955 roughly a third of American workers were union members. In the biggest companies, management and labor bargained as equals, so much so that it was common to talk about corporations serving an array of ''stakeholders'' as opposed to merely serving stockholders.
Squeezed between high taxes and empowered workers, executives were relatively impoverished by the standards of either earlier or later generations. In 1955 Fortune magazine published an essay, ''How top executives live,'' which emphasized how modest their lifestyles had become compared with days of yore. The vast mansions, armies of servants, and huge yachts of the 1920s were no more; by 1955 the typical executive, Fortune claimed, lived in a smallish suburban house, relied on part-time help and skippered his own relatively small boat.
The data confirm Fortune's impressions. Between the 1920s and the 1950s real incomes for the richest Americans fell sharply, not just compared with the middle class but in absolute terms. According to estimates by the economists Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez, in 1955 the real incomes of the top 0.01 percent of Americans were less than half what they had been in the late 1920s, and their share of total income was down by three-quarters.
Today, of course, the mansions, armies of servants and yachts are back, bigger than ever -- and any hint of policies that might crimp plutocrats' style is met with cries of ''socialism.'' Indeed, the whole Romney campaign was based on the premise that President Obama's threat to modestly raise taxes on top incomes, plus his temerity in suggesting that some bankers had behaved badly, were crippling the economy. Surely, then, the far less plutocrat-friendly environment of the 1950s must have been an economic disaster, right?
Actually, some people thought so at the time. Paul Ryan and many other modern conservatives are devotees of Ayn Rand. Well, the collapsing, moocher-infested nation she portrayed in ''Atlas Shrugged,'' published in 1957, was basically Dwight Eisenhower's America.
Strange to say, however, the oppressed executives Fortune portrayed in 1955 didn't go Galt and deprive the nation of their talents. On the contrary, if Fortune is to be believed, they were working harder than ever. And the high-tax, strong-union decades after World War II were in fact marked by spectacular, widely shared economic growth: nothing before or since has matched the doubling of median family income between 1947 and 1973.
Which brings us back to the nostalgia thing.
There are, let's face it, some people in our political life who pine for the days when minorities and women knew their place, gays stayed firmly in the closet and congressmen asked, ''Are you now or have you ever been?'' The rest of us, however, are very glad those days are gone. We are, morally, a much better nation than we were. Oh, and the food has improved a lot, too.
Along the way, however, we've forgotten something important -- namely, that economic justice and economic growth aren't incompatible. America in the 1950s made the rich pay their fair share; it gave workers the power to bargain for decent wages and benefits; yet contrary to right-wing propaganda then and now, it prospered. And we can do that again.

HEADLINE: Class-Based vs. Race-Based Admissions

 BODY:
Admissions policies that take class into account, rather than race, are getting a renewed push as a win-win solution. The contention is that they more fully serve the goal of diversity in higher education and provide a progressive way to resolve an enduring conflict that has now returned to the Supreme Court in a case about race-conscious admissions at the University of Texas at Austin.
But a crucial premise of the class-over-race argument is wrong. It is not possible to maintain the same level of racial diversity in higher education while applying a race-blind admissions policy. Class-based admissions generally reduce the number of black and Hispanic students. To maintain or build the levels of racial diversity on selective campuses, it is necessary to maintain race-conscious admissions. 
While there are higher shares of blacks and Hispanics among low-income Americans, their smaller shares of the whole population mean that whites make up by far the largest portion of low-income families. As Alan Krueger, now head of President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, and his co-authors wrote in 2006, ''The correlation between race and family income, while strong, is not strong enough to permit the latter to function as a useful proxy for race in the pursuit of diversity.''
Class-based policies can maintain the share of blacks and Hispanics at selective colleges and universities only if admissions policies also give an advantage to blacks and Hispanics that is not race-blind. That is also the finding of Anthony Carnevale and his co-authors, researchers relied on by advocates for class-based policies. Advocates may broaden the definition of social and economic disadvantage to include other factors, like speaking a foreign language at home, but these are proxies for ethnicity or race.
Harvard's Thomas Kane found that selective colleges and universities using class-based admissions would have to save six times as many places for low-income students to maintain the same level of black and Hispanic students. (That was in 1997-8, but none of the core premises for that conclusion have changed much.) For colleges and universities committed to diversity, the right way to think about class- and race-conscious admissions is as complements rather than alternatives. Both are essential for a truly diverse campus.
Maintaining race-conscious admissions contributes significantly to campus diversity, while serving racial and social justice. Expanding class-conscious admissions significantly expands diversity while serving social and economic justice -- though it also requires considerably more financial aid, which is why the wealthiest and most selective colleges and universities have more such diversity.
A benefit of the attention to class-based admissions policies is the spotlight it puts on how much education from kindergarten through college favors students with economic and social advantages. Those from the top fifth of households in income are at least seven times as likely to go to selective colleges as those in the bottom fifth. The achievement gap between high- and low-income groups is almost twice as wide as between whites and blacks.
But the disadvantage resulting from class status does not change the reality that blacks and Hispanics are also substantially underrepresented at selective colleges and universities. In 2004, they were 14.5 percent and 16 percent, respectively, of those graduating from high schools, but only 3.5 percent and 7 percent of those enrolling in selective colleges and universities. The underrepresentation has gotten worse over the past generation.
In 2003, when the Supreme Court ruled that race-conscious admissions are constitutional if carefully carried out, it gave two basic reasons: they serve a compelling interest of society; and without them, selective colleges and universities would be much less diverse than they must be to serve that interest.
Shifts in American demographics since then have only reinforced this crucial need.

HEADLINE: As Coasts Rebuild and U.S. Pays, Repeatedly, the Critics Ask Why

BYLINE: By JUSTIN GILLIS and FELICITY BARRINGER

 BODY:
DAUPHIN ISLAND, Ala. -- Even in the off season, the pastel beach houses lining a skinny strip of sand here are a testament to the good life.
They are also a monument to the generosity of the federal government.
The western end of this Gulf Coast island has proved to be one of the most hazardous places in the country for waterfront property. Since 1979, nearly a dozen hurricanes and large storms have rolled in and knocked down houses, chewed up sewers and water pipes and hurled sand onto the roads.
Yet time and again, checks from Washington have allowed the town to put itself back together.
Across the nation, tens of billions of tax dollars have been spent on subsidizing coastal reconstruction in the aftermath of storms, usually with little consideration of whether it actually makes sense to keep rebuilding in disaster-prone areas. If history is any guide, a large fraction of the federal money allotted to New York, New Jersey and other states recovering from Hurricane Sandy -- an amount that could exceed $30 billion -- will be used the same way. 
Tax money will go toward putting things back as they were, essentially duplicating the vulnerability that existed before the hurricane.
''We're Americans, damn it,'' said Robert S. Young, a North Carolina geologist who has studied the way communities like Dauphin Island respond to storms. ''Retreat is a dirty word.''
This island community of roughly 1,300 year-round residents has become a symbol of that reflexive policy.
Like many other beachfront towns, Dauphin Island has benefited from the Stafford Act, a federal law that taps the United States Treasury for 75 percent or more of the cost of fixing storm-damaged infrastructure, like roads and utilities.
At least $80 million, adjusted for inflation, has gone into patching up this one island since 1979 -- more than $60,000 for every permanent resident. That does not include payments of $72 million to homeowners from the highly subsidized federal flood insurance program.
Lately, scientists, budget-conscious lawmakers and advocacy groups across the political spectrum have argued that these subsidies waste money, put lives at risk and make no sense in an era of changing climate and rising seas.
Some of them contend that reconstruction money should be tightly coupled with requirements that coastal communities begin reducing their vulnerability in the short run and that towns along shorelines facing the largest risks make plans for withdrawal over the long term.
''The best thing that could possibly come out of Sandy is if the political establishment was willing to say, 'Let's have a conversation about how we do this differently the next time,' '' said Dr. Young, a coastal geologist who directs the Program for the Study of Developed Shorelines at Western Carolina University. ''We need to identify those areas -- in advance -- that it no longer makes sense to rebuild.''
A coalition in Washington called SmarterSafer.org, made up of environmentalists, libertarians and budget watchdogs, contends that the subsidies have essentially become a destructive, unaffordable entitlement.
''We simply can't go on subsidizing enormous numbers of people to live in areas that are prone to huge natural disasters,'' said Eli Lehrer, the president of the conservative R Street Institute, part of the coalition.
This argument might be gaining some traction. Earlier this year, Congress passed changes to the federal flood insurance program that are supposed to raise historically low premiums and reduce homeowner incentives for rebuilding in the most hazardous areas.
Less widely known about than flood insurance are the subsidies from the Stafford Act, the federal law governing the response to emergencies like hurricanes, wildfires and tornadoes. It kicks in when the president declares a federal disaster that exceeds the response capacity of state and local governments.
Experts say the law is at least as important as the flood program in motivating reconstruction after storms. In the same way flood insurance shields families from the financial consequences of rebuilding in risky areas, the Stafford Act shields local and state governments from the full implications of their decisions on land use.
Under the law, the federal government committed more than $80 billion to disaster recovery from 2004 to 2011, according to a report from the Government Accountability Office. While billions of dollars went to relieve immediate suffering, including cash payments to families left homeless by storms, nearly half of the money was spent helping state and local governments clean and restore damaged areas and rebuild infrastructure.
At times, local governments have tried to use the money to reduce their vulnerability to future disasters, but they complain that they often run into bureaucratic roadblocks with the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
For instance, after flooding from Hurricane Irene washed out many culverts in Vermont last year, many towns built bigger culverts to handle future floods. But they are still fighting with the agency over reimbursement.
W. Craig Fugate, the agency's administrator, acknowledged in an interview that ''as a nation, we have not yet figured out'' how to use federal incentives to improve resiliency and discourage excessive risks.
If private property owners want to assume the risks, ''that's one thing,'' he said. ''But if we find that we as taxpayers are assuming that risk without benefit, then we need to rethink that.''
Dauphin Island is a case study in the way the federal subsidies have enabled repetitive risk taking. Orrin H. Pilkey, an emeritus professor at Duke University who is renowned for his research in costal zones, described the situation here as a ''scandal.''
The island, four miles off the Alabama coast, was for centuries the site of a small fishing and farming village reachable only by boat. But in the 1950s, the Chamber of Commerce in nearby Mobile decided to link it to the mainland by bridge and sell lots for vacation homes.
Then Hurricane Frederic struck in 1979, ravaging the island and destroying the bridge.
President Jimmy Carter flew over to inspect the damage. Rex Rainer, the Alabama highway director at the time, recalled several years later that the president ''told us to build everything back just like it was and send him the bill.''
The era of taxpayer largess toward Dauphin Island had begun. With $33 million of federal money, local leaders built a fancier, higher bridge that encouraged more development in the 1980s. Much of that construction occurred on the island's western end, a long, narrow sand bar sitting only a few feet above the Gulf of Mexico.
''You can always look back and say, 'Maybe we shouldn't have done that,' '' said Mayor Jeff Collier, who noted that many of the decisions were made before he took office over a decade ago. ''But we can't turn the clock back.''
In the 1990s, big storms started hitting the island roughly every three years. Two back-to-back hurricanes, Ivan in 2004 and Katrina in 2005, destroyed more than 300 homes. Most have not been rebuilt, but scores have been. Some beachfront building lots are now inundated by the Gulf of Mexico.
The bulk of the town's reconstruction money has been spent on the western end. That means many of the prime beneficiaries have not been permanent residents, but rather vacation homeowners from places like New Orleans and Atlanta.
Since 1988, federal figures show, Dauphin Island property owners have paid only $9.3 million in premiums to the national flood insurance program, but they have received $72.2 million in payments for their damaged homes. Figures from a federal contractor show that the average island resident pays less than $700 a year for flood insurance, though a few do pay as much as $3,000.
On Dauphin Island and in many other beachfront communities, the federal subsidies have helped people replace small beach shacks with larger, more valuable homes. That is a main reason the nation's costs of storm recovery are roughly doubling every decade, even after adjusting for inflation.
Dauphin Island has tried to limit its risk, imposing stricter building codes that go beyond federal requirements. New houses now must be built high on pilings to survive storm surges.
Local residents argue that federal help is warranted because their erosion problems have been worsened by government dredging in the nearby Mobile Ship Channel, which some scientists agree has helped starve the Dauphin Island beaches of sand. And residents say that simply letting the island's western end wash away would leave the mainland and its marshes, rich with seafood, more exposed to storms.
People here have formed strong emotional attachments to their island. ''There's a lot of wildlife and a lot of bird life, and it's just a great place to relax,'' said Jay Minus, a lawyer in Mobile who owns two homes on the western end. ''You can sit on the porch and watch the dolphins swim past your house.''
Just this summer, Hurricane Isaac dealt the island a moderate blow, leaving most homes unscathed but managing to do $3 million worth of damage to public infrastructure. On a recent day, bulldozers crawled around the island, scooping up tons of sand to replenish the beach. As in the past, the town will most likely pay only 15 percent of the repair costs.
Coastal geologists describe western Dauphin Island as a textbook example of a place that should never have been developed. Scientists say that climate change will most likely speed up the rise of sea levels in the coming decades and that many more coastal communities will face repetitive risks.
With little pressure coming from Washington or state governments, only a handful of communities have started thinking seriously about a new approach.
''We need a plan,'' Dr. Young said.
Given the political realities, however, it is by no means clear how to move forward. In some flood plains, public money has been used to buy out vulnerable property owners. Entire towns were moved out of the Mississippi River flood plain in the 1990s, for instance, saving money over the long haul.
Several oceanfront communities have resisted such proposals, though one, in Texas, consented to a buyout plan after being badly damaged by Hurricane Ike in 2008. The federal government, despite its willingness to spend tens of billions of dollars repairing communities after storms, has not put up the kind of buyout money that might convince more owners to walk away.
Because buyout proposals often take years to put together, several experts suggested that they be drawn up in advance with maps of properties targeted for acquisition. Then, if those homes are damaged, state or local leaders could move swiftly after a storm, offering the owners voluntary buyouts before they make up their minds to rebuild.
Mr. Collier, the mayor, has long heard the argument that a rising sea will ultimately force a retreat from Dauphin Island and similar places.
''I'm not going to say that's wrong,'' he said. ''But somebody needs to tell me, how are we going to get there?''

HEADLINE: Hey Fannie and Freddie, Pay Us Back!

BYLINE: By JOSHUA ROSNER. 
Joshua Rosner, a financial services analyst, is a co-author, with Gretchen Morgenson, of ''Reckless Endangerment: How Outsized Ambition, Greed, and Corruption Created the Worst Financial Crisis of Our Time.''

 BODY:
WHO says Democrats and Republicans can't agree on anything? When it comes to fixing the government's troubled and costly relationship with the private mortgage market, bipartisanship is very much alive. Politicians in both parties have reached consensus over the past four years to simply do nothing.
Consider the elephant in the room: Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac owe American taxpayers nearly $140 billion -- and there seems to be no plan on any front to pay it back. 
Though many Americans aren't aware of it, the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) are publicly traded companies -- like I.B.M. or General Electric. Except these two giant housing lenders were created by Congress and, as a result, have a relationship, albeit an awkward one, with Uncle Sam. As so-called government-sponsored enterprises, or G.S.E.'s, they have long played an important role in the development of the nation, helping to channel credit to millions of Americans who might otherwise not be able to get home mortgages.
The trouble now is that the debt owed by Fannie and Freddie, both of which have been in government conservatorship since 2008, is being ignored.
That year, in the midst of the housing crisis and the Great Recession, Washington agreed to spend $600 billion in public money to rescue major American banks, insurers, automakers and, yes, the G.S.E.'s -- fearing an even deeper and longer recession if these companies failed. Since then, most of these bailed-out firms have paid taxpayers back.
Not Fannie or Freddie.
Even more remarkable than their $140 billion public debt (the money lent to the agencies minus dividends paid) -- equivalent to the stock market capitalizations of the Starbucks Corporation, the Kellogg Company and the McDonald's Corporation combined -- is that there seems to be no active plan to make taxpayers whole again. This, in short, has become the forgotten bailout.
As President Obama and leaders in Congress thrust and parry over the imminent ''fiscal cliff,'' it seems just plain nuts to ignore an I.O.U. that immense. Throw in the recently announced shortfall in reserves at the Federal Housing Administration, the government-run mortgage-insurance program, and the national mortgage mess gets even uglier.
The government has tried to recover some of what Fannie and Freddie owe -- but until recently this was limited to interest on the government loan, not the principle.
Last summer, the United States Treasury decided that, rather than require the G.S.E.'s to pay interest on their debt to taxpayers, it would require any profits generated by Fannie and Freddie to be swept into the Treasury's coffers. Unfortunately, this has created problems of its own because it has led to the commingling of the still legally private G.S.E. funds with those of the federal government -- and it complicates the ultimate recapture of Fannie's and Freddie's value. Moreover, as the International Monetary Fund recently warned, the practice adds major risk to the United States balance sheet.
A better approach is possible -- but to devise the right plan, lawmakers will have to start giving the issue the attention it deserves.
In the early part of the 1990s, as Fannie and Freddie were reporting record profits, legislators ignored those who warned that Fannie and Freddie were leading the rush toward the coming calamity in housing.
Then, in mid-decade, the Clinton administration embarked on a plan to expand homeownership rates by easing lending standards; the effort encouraged borrowers to keep less equity in their homes and to buy bigger properties than they could afford. But policy makers played down the risks under the belief that ''more lending'' was always better.
In the early 2000s, a few legislators did seek changes that would have tamed the aggressive lending practices of these two behemoth agencies. But these were stymied by the Bush administration.
When, later in the decade, Fannie and Freddie bought billions of dollars in subprime loans, some respected financial analysts warned of the risks they posed. Washington paid little heed. Representative Barney Frank, then chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said Freddie and Fannie weren't the problem. They were ''the good part'' of the home-financing system. Mr. Frank was hardly alone in such thinking: this was the default view in the nation's capital.
By 2007, the housing crisis was fully upon us. Still, the Bush administration, the Federal Reserve and Congress would wait another year before acknowledging that the crisis was indeed more profound than a short-term lack of confidence in the market. Rather than force Fannie and Freddie to raise their capital reserves to the levels needed, though, Washington continued to bury its head.
Today, five years after the housing crisis began and well over a decade since lawmakers were made aware of the economic turmoil a failing Fannie and Freddie could wreak, it's time for the public to demand some answers.
Maybe we won't get all of them. But we can start, at least, by posing two simple questions to every lawmaker within earshot: What are the plans to recover the $140 billion the American taxpayer is owed -- and when will we be paid back?

HEADLINE: In Solitary, With Insects As Cellmates

BYLINE: By JENNIFER SCHUESSLER

 BODY:
If you were sentenced to solitary confinement, would you pray to God, hire a better lawyer or perhaps contemplate suicide?
Or would you brush up on your insect small talk, practice advanced mental origami, or turn yourself into a guinea pig in radical memory experiments?
Such were the options under discussion Saturday at New York University's Cantor Film Center, at an event that raised another question: How do you get people voluntarily to spend a sunny day in a windowless auditorium listening to nine hours of discussion about one of the grimmest aspects of the criminal justice system? 
The event, called ''Should You Ever Happen to Find Yourself in Solitary,'' was part policy seminar, part shambolic TED conference, luring some 100 people (at least one of whom was playing solitaire on his laptop) to listen to a parade of artists and writers talk about their fantasies of the experience before hitting them with the hard stuff.
''I like to find ways of ensorcelling people into rooms they didn't think they'd be in,'' said Lawrence Weschler, director of the New York Institute for the Humanities, who organized the event as the latest of his annual Wonder Cabinets, all-day events devoted to the eccentric exploration of subjects ranging from the idea of American innocence to the evolution of beauty. ''And one way you do that is by presenting one cool thing after another.''
On Saturday that meant bringing in boldface names like the playwright Tony Kushner, the monologuist Mike Daisey and the activist pranksters the Yes Men, along with former prisoners who testified to the fundamentally anti-creative nature of solitary confinement.
''When I'm asked what it was like, I kind of come up against a blank wall,'' said Shane Bauer, one of the three American hikers imprisoned in Iran from 2009 through 2011, who was patched in to the event by telephone. ''As the months passed, I became less able to think.''
The sometimes awkward balance of whimsy and stark reality was summed up in the event's poster, which featured the artist Liza Lou's sculpture of a prison toilet covered in thousands of tiny white glass beads, an outgrowth of a project in which she beaded every surface of a prison cell. ''It's her take on the white cube of an art gallery,'' Mr. Weschler said.
Art galleries may be far from the real isolation cells that currently hold at least 25,000 prisoners in the United States, and probably tens of thousands more, according to experts. But on Saturday the assembled creative types did their best to make cheerful use of imaginary blank walls.
Catherine Chalmers, a photographer and video artist who works with live insects, gave instructions on how to make friends with flies and cockroaches. (Catch two flies, she noted, and you'll get to watch a lot of kinky sex.) Joshua Foer, the author of ''Moonwalking With Einstein: The Art and Science of Remembering Everything,'' described the self-experiments of the French chronobiologist Michel Siffre, who voluntarily confined himself to an underground for six months with no watch, calendar or other time cues. And after screening the YouTube math celebrity Vi Hart's viral video about folding strips of paper into shapes called hexaflexagons, Mr. Weschler brought out a 9-year-old girl to pass out 100 samples.
Mr. Daisey, who was recently sent to the media woodshed for embellishing the facts in a story for ''This American Life,'' brought down the house with a monologue enacting the bundle of pre-verbal physical tics he would be reduced to if sent to solitary. Even for a monologuist, he said, ''if you're alone, there's no point to speaking.''
After a lunch break whimsy gave way to reality with a panel of four former prisoners. The writer and anti-apartheid activist Breyten Breytenbach, who spent nearly seven years in solitary in his native South Africa, described how hallucinations turned cell walls into paintings by Breugel and Bosch. Robert Hillary King, a former Black Panther who spent 29 years in solitary at Angola State Prison in Louisiana in a tangled case that ended with his original conviction being overturned in 2001, compared the American prison system to slavery.
Mr. Bauer, however, answered carefully when asked if he'd rather be in solitary in Iran or at Pelican Bay State Prison, the supermax facility in Crescent City, Calif., whose conditions he recently described in an investigative report for Mother Jones. Some prisoners at Pelican Bay, he noted, have been in solitary for more than 20 years. ''It's unimaginable to me, having had a glimpse of that experience,'' he said.
The audience seemed grateful for scraps of comic relief, whatever the source. Tim Blunk, who spent 13 years in prison after his arrest in 1984 in New Jersey for possession of more than 600 pounds of explosives in connection with what he characterized as ''an armed clandestine movement trying to stop the wars in Central America,'' got big laughs with tales of his jailhouse dreams, including one about flying on the space shuttle.
''I'd wake up the next morning in a concrete bunker, still convinced the dream is real, and that I was incarcerated because I was the first radical in space,'' he said.
There were few jokes in the day's final panel, which included Scarlet S. Kim of the New York Civil Liberties Union, co-author of a recent report on ''extreme isolation'' in New York State, and Juan E. Mndez, the United Nations ''special rapporteur'' on torture and other abuse, who last March issued a report calling for a ban on most solitary confinement.
Colorado, Illinois, Maine, California and Mississippi have recently taken steps to reduce their populations in solitary, as much in response to economics as to humanitarian appeals. Mr. Weschler, closing the event, wryly suggested a rallying cry for New York State: ''Can't we be almost as good as Mississippi?''

HEADLINE: Scrambling Among Narrowed Mayoral Field

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN

 BODY:
Ask the major contenders for New York City mayor next year who benefits most from the decision by Scott M. Stringer, the Manhattan borough president, not to run for mayor, and each answers the same way: ''Me.''
As news spread of Mr. Stringer's decision, which he confirmed on Sunday, to run for comptroller rather than mayor in 2013, the remaining Democratic hopefuls scrambled to woo his supporters and claim a strategic advantage in a race that has been kicking into a higher gear since the conclusion of the presidential campaign earlier this month. 
Christine C. Quinn, the City Council speaker and the best-known expected candidate in the mayoral race, lavished praise on Mr. Stringer. In a statement Sunday, she said: ''Scott is a fantastic public servant with an impressive record of accomplishment and will do great things for the city in the future.''
But her aides and supporters could barely contain their enthusiasm that Mr. Stringer's withdrawal from the race left Ms. Quinn, a Chelsea resident, well-positioned to pick up Mr. Stringer's Manhattan support. The Quinn team believes that she is best positioned to win over West Side Democrats who were Mr. Stringer's strength.
Supporters of Bill de Blasio, the public advocate and another expected candidate for mayor, were equally bullish. They believe that Mr. de Blasio, a Park Slope resident, can now consolidate support from labor unions and some West Side liberals turned off by Ms. Quinn's close alliance with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. Mr. de Blasio immediately reached out to Mr. Stringer's camp by endorsing Mr. Stringer for comptroller.
''Scott Stringer has a strong record as a progressive reformer,'' said Rebecca Katz, a de Blasio campaign spokeswoman. ''His decision further clarifies the 2013 landscape, and identifies Bill as the clear progressive alternative.''
William C. Thompson Jr., a former comptroller who lost to Mr. Bloomberg in 2009 and plans to make another bid for mayor next year, was encouraged, too. He believes that he can dominate the black and Latino Manhattan neighborhoods north of 96th Street where Mr. Stringer might have competed with him.
He, too, backed Mr. Stringer's next endeavor. ''I know that Scott Stringer would be an exceptional comptroller,'' Mr. Thompson said in a statement. ''Scott will bring the executive leadership, fiscal knowledge and sound judgment to the office of comptroller that he has demonstrated repeatedly throughout his accomplished career in public service.''
The current comptroller, John C. Liu, who is also expected to run for mayor next year, said he thought Mr. Stringer would be a ''great comptroller'' and said, ''Scott's a pretty smart guy and this is a pretty smart move.'' Mr. Liu, whose campaign has been hampered by a federal investigation into its finances, said it was too early to assess the impact of Mr. Stringer's withdrawal on the race, saying ''there could be more entrants.'' But Scott Levenson, a political consultant who is not affiliated with any campaign, said that Mr. Stringer's move would benefit Mr. de Blasio, Ms. Quinn and Mr. Thompson. ''It's inarguable that Scott's departure from the mayoral field helps each of the candidates,'' Mr. Levenson said. ''And when you reduce the field from four to three, it allows the voting public to focus more on the choices.''
Another political consultant, Bruce N. Gyory, said that ''in the short run it clearly helps de Blasio, by opening up the vote-rich West Side. Long term, the most likely outcome is not one which yet favors any candidate.''
The Democratic primary is likely to be in September, although the date could be changed by the Legislature. The Democratic nominee will face a Republican challenger in November -- Tom Allon, the publisher of a chain of community newspapers; Adolfo Carrin Jr., a former Bronx borough president, and George T. McDonald, the founder and president of the Doe Fund are among the likely contenders for the Republican nomination. The city's voters are overwhelmingly Democratic, but no Democrat has won a mayoral campaign since 1989.
In an interview, Mr. Stringer spiced up the mayor's race by suggesting that he would endorse one of the remaining candidates, though not immediately. He was also forthright about why he had decided not to run for mayor, but for comptroller instead.
''I recognized, as I explored the mayor's race, that I wasn't the front-runner,'' he said. ''I think that was a challenging situation -- I'm not going to gloss that over.''
But he added that he viewed his run for comptroller as ''not dropping down'' but ''stepping up,'' because he said ''the office of comptroller has never been more important.'' He continued, ''The city faces serious economic and financial challenges, many of which have been made worse by the hurricane.''
Mr. Stringer also rolled out an early list of prominent supporters, including former Mayor Edward I. Koch; Representative Jerrold Nadler; Elizabeth Holtzman, a former congresswoman, city comptroller and district attorney; Fernando Ferrer, a former Bronx borough president; Assemblyman Karim Camara of Brooklyn; and Gloria Steinem.
The race for comptroller is likely to be competitive; Councilman Dan Garodnick, also a Democrat, has said he will be a candidate as well.

HEADLINE: Viewing Damage, Biden Vows To Help Storm-Battered Areas

BYLINE: By MATT FLEGENHEIMER

 BODY:
Recalling his roots as a Northeasterner ''literally raised on the shore,'' Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. pledged unswerving federal support on Sunday for the areas ravaged by Hurricane Sandy.
''This is a national responsibility,'' Mr. Biden said, standing before a heap of discarded wood on the Boardwalk in Seaside Heights, N.J.
He promised, referring to himself, that the state had a ''homeboy'' in the White House. 
The visit came less than three weeks after President Obama's well-publicized tour of New Jersey with Chris Christie, the state's Republican governor, just days before the presidential election.
Mr. Christie did not accompany the vice president on this visit, though Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno and Senators Robert Menendez and Frank R. Lautenberg joined him for some or all of the trip. Mr. Biden did say that he had a ''long conversation'' with Mr. Christie before his arrival.
New Jersey, New York and Connecticut are expected to need tens of billions of dollars in storm relief; Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has already asked for at least $30 billion in federal aid for New York.
The region has shown some signs of recovery: power has largely been restored to affected communities, and gas rationing has ended for all but New York City, where Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg on Sunday extended it through Friday.
But there are also still very vivid signs that more work needs to be done. After the disclosure that about 200 storm-ravaged homes would have to be demolished by the New York City Buildings Department, officials on Sunday indicated that the city would not immediately charge homeowners for the cost of demolition, and that ''as much assistance as possible'' would be offered.
In New Jersey, Mr. Biden saw firsthand one of the shorefront communities hardest hit by the storm. After landing at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst on Sunday morning, Mr. Biden was flown to the Seaside Heights area by helicopter, traveling above a harrowing stretch of shoreline towns.
Businesses swept away, marinas filled with pileups of boats, homes with ground floors all but hollowed out -- all were on display along the vice president's route, as residents looked up from their doorsteps to investigate the ruckus overhead.
Some roads were frosted with sand, weeks after the beach line first encroached inland. Homes tilted to the side like drooping wedding cakes. The residents themselves were only allowed back to their town last Monday.
Mr. Biden's motorcade rolled past rows of ghostly shore-side homes, boarded up and crumbling. ''For rent,'' read a sign affixed to one of them. ''Summer and winter.''
For those in the Northeast, Mr. Biden said, the ocean and its beaches are ''our Grand Canyon'' -- integral not only to local economies but also to the culture of the region.
In neighboring Seaside Park, N.J., Mr. Biden, clad in boots, a baseball cap and a leather jacket, had walked a portion of the beach with Mayor Robert Matthies.
''Come on, show me,'' he said, as the mayor led him to the shore. He asked Mr. Matthies, a former school superintendent, what position he had held previously.
''You can handle school superintendent,'' Mr. Biden said, ''you can handle anything.''
At the Seaside Heights Volunteer Fire Station, Mr. Biden visited with first responders (''how ya doing?''), a young boy (''how old are ya?'') and officials from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
After touring Seaside Heights, where the storm left a roller coaster standing flimsily in the water, he flew to Hoboken, which has been left without its critical PATH train service since the storm.
Mr. Biden, who did not take questions from reporters during his trip, trumpeted his transportation credentials, calling himself Amtrak's ''most ardent passenger.'' After surveying the PATH train station with Mayor Dawn Zimmer and other officials, he said that restoring the system was critical.
''There's probably no other city in America where as high a percentage of the population takes public transportation every day,'' he said.
Before leaving the city, Mr. Biden made stops at Benny Tudino's, a pizzeria, and Hudson Tavern, a restaurant that had closed for nearly two weeks because of flooding after the storm.
Ruben Pino, a manager at Hudson Tavern, said he had heard about the vice president's visit ''maybe an hour'' before the group arrived. While he believed this to be Mr. Biden's first visit to the bar, he said the establishment was no stranger to celebrities because ''Eli Manning comes here all the time.''
As the vice president and his entourage filled the restaurant, a worker stood guard at the door. ''Sorry,'' he said softly, ''you guys got to order something.''
Mr. Lautenberg, the state's 88-year-old senior senator, would soon oblige.
''I'm your senator,'' he shouted moments later, as the bar went quiet. ''All I want is a Diet Coke.''
He was served the beverage, to cheers.

HEADLINE: Investors Rush To Beat Threat Of Higher Taxes

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL POPPER and NELSON D. SCHWARTZ; David Kocieniewski contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Business owners and investors are rapidly maneuvering to shield themselves from the prospect of higher taxes next year, a strategy that is sending ripples across Wall Street and broad areas of the economy.
Take Steve Wynn, the casino magnate, who has been a vocal critic of higher tax rates. He and his fellow shareholders in Wynn Resorts, the company announced, will collect a special dividend of $750 million on Tuesday, a payout timed to take advantage of current rates. Experts estimated that taking the payout this year instead of next could save Mr. Wynn, who owns a sizable stake in the company, more than $20 million.
For the wealthy like Mr. Wynn, the overriding goal is to record as much of their future income this year as they can. This includes moves as diverse as sales of businesses, one-time dividends and the sale of stocks that have been big winners.
''In my 30 years in practice, I've never seen such a flood of desire and action to transfer a business and cash out,'' said Kenneth K. Bezozo, a partner in New York with the law firm Haynes and Boone. ''We're seeing a watershed event.'' 
Whether small business owners or individuals saving for retirement, investors are being urged by their advisers to reconsider their holdings. Along the way, many are shedding the very investments that have been the most popular over the last year, contributing to recent sell-offs in formerly high-flying shares like Apple and Amazon.
Investors typically take profits in their own portfolio at year-end, but the selling appears to be more targeted this year. Stocks with large dividends, for instance, are seen as less attractive because of the perceived likelihood of a sharp increase in the tax rate on dividends.
All this is weighing on the broader financial markets, as worries mount about the economic drag from the combination of higher tax rates and reduced government spending set for January if President Obama and Senate Republicans cannot reach a budget compromise before then.
Fears about the fiscal impasse in Washington, along with anxiety about fading corporate profits and weakening economies abroad, have pushed the benchmark Standard & Poor's 500-stock index down about 5 percent since the election. On Friday, major stock indexes had their best showing of the week after President Obama and Republican leaders signaled that a compromise was possible.
Even if many of the tax breaks scheduled to expire survive a new budget deal, some business owners and investors are bracing for substantial increases in specific areas of the tax code.
The top rate on dividends, for example, could climb to 39.6 percent from 15 percent if no action is taken. Capital gains taxes, which now top out at 15 percent, could rise above 20 percent, many financial advisers say. Most investment income will also be subject to a 3.8 percent charge to help pay for President Obama's health care law.
Stocks that pay big dividends have been popular in recent years among investors eager for an alternative to the meager returns on bank savings accounts and Treasury securities. Since October, though, the two sectors that provide the most generous dividend payments -- utilities and telecommunication stocks -- have been among the worst performers, hurt also in part by the devastation of Hurricane Sandy on the East Coast. Utility companies in the S.& P. 500 have fallen 9.4 percent from their highs in October. Telecommunication stocks in the index have dropped 11.3 percent from theirs, compared with the broader index's 6.8 percent decline from its recent high.
John Moorin, the founder of a medical equipment company near Indianapolis, said he sold about $650,000 in dividend-paying stocks like McDonald's and Coca-Cola a few days after the election, worried about the potential increase in taxes.
''I love these companies, but I'm so scared that now all of the sudden I'm going to get taxed at such a rate with them that they won't be worth anything,'' Mr. Moorin said.
Although Mr. Wynn has declared special dividends at the end of the year before -- most recently in 2011 -- in a call with analysts last month, he hinted that higher taxes would cause him and other chief executives to rethink big payouts in future years.
In the meantime, he added, it was ''very difficult to do long-range planning with a government that moves as much as this does on so many issues.''
Leggett & Platt, a diversified manufacturer based in Carthage, Mo., decided to move up payment of its fourth-quarter dividend to December from January so shareholders could take advantage of the lower rate.
''If we can help our shareholders avoid taxes and keep more of their dividends, we'll do it,'' said David M. DeSonier, senior vice president for corporate strategy and investor relations.
While negotiators are trying to find ways to raise more revenue for the long term, some experts expect a substantial bump in tax collections in the short term as investors take a multitude of steps now that they would have taken in future years. After the top tax rate on capital gains rose to 28 percent from 20 percent at the end of 1986, federal receipts from such gains doubled to $52.9 billion in 1987, as sales surged at the end of the previous tax year.
The potential jump in tax rates has been telegraphed for months, but many investors say they did not respond sooner because they were waiting to see if Mitt Romney would defeat the president and move forward with his commitment to keep rates at current levels. President Obama, since defeating Mr. Romney, has continued his call for an increase in marginal tax rates on the wealthy. A growing number of Republican leaders have conceded that some increase is now likely.
Kristina Collins, a chiropractor in McLean, Va., said she and her husband planned to closely monitor the business income from their joint practice to avoid crossing the income threshold for higher taxes outlined by President Obama on earnings above $200,000 for individuals and $250,000 for couples.
Ms. Collins said she felt torn by being near the cutoff line and disappointed that federal tax policy was providing a disincentive to keep expanding a business she founded in 1998.
''If we're really close and it's near the end-year, maybe we'll just close down for a while and go on vacation,'' she said.
Of the potential changes in the tax code set to take place on Jan. 1, the scheduled increase in the tax rate on capital gains would hit a particularly broad range of investments.
Business owners, for instance, can lock in the current top rate of 15 percent on capital gains if they sell their company before the end of the year. The capital gains tax also applies to increases in the value of stocks and other securities, encouraging some investors to sell holdings that have done well. This is one of several factors cited in the recent plunge in the price of Apple shares. They have dropped 26 percent since mid-September after rising 73 percent earlier in the year.
The coming changes have not hurt all assets. Municipal bonds have become more attractive because they are exempt from most federal taxes, including the new surcharge related to President Obama's health care law. Frank Fantozzi, a financial planner in Cleveland, is recommending that his wealthy clients increase their allocation to municipal bonds from around 30 percent to about 40 percent.
But the potential effect of the scheduled tax increases and government spending cuts has been mostly negative. Many market strategists have suggested trimming overall holdings of risky assets like stocks, and business executives are proceeding very cautiously.
Some business owners say they are holding off on hiring plans because they expect tax rates to rise. Dyke Messinger, chief executive of Power Curbers in Salisbury, N.C., said he would like to fill four slots at his construction equipment company but would only hire three people because he anticipated that his tax bill would rise by $100,000.
''It's not a huge amount of money,'' Mr. Messinger said. ''But it's enough money that you don't want to make a misstep.''

HEADLINE: Obama, in an Emerging Myanmar, Vows Support

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

 BODY:
YANGON, Myanmar -- President Obama journeyed to this storied tropical outpost of pagodas and jungles on Monday to ''extend the hand of friendship'' as a land long tormented by repression and poverty begins to throw off military rule and emerge from decades of isolation.
Mr. Obama arrived here as the first sitting American president to visit Myanmar with the hope of solidifying the stunning changes that have transformed this Southeast Asian country and encouraging additional progress toward a more democratic system. With the promise of more financial assistance, Mr. Obama vowed to ''support you every step of the way.''
The president was greeted on a mild, muggy day by tens of thousands of people lining the road from the airport -- and by further promises of reform by the government, which announced a series of specific commitments regarding the release of political prisoners and the end of ethnic violence. Though Mr. Obama planned to stay just six hours, his visit was seen here as a validation of a new era. 
He made a point of meeting at the government headquarters with President Thein Sein and also planned a personal pilgrimage to the home of the opposition leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, where she was confined under house arrest for most of two decades before her release two years ago. Amid the manicured lawn and well-tended garden outside the elegant two-story lakeside house, the president and the Nobel-winning dissident planned to stand side by side celebrating change that once seemed unimaginable.
While local leaders attribute the changes so far to internal factors and decisions, Mr. Obama was eager to claim a measure of credit. He has played nursemaid to the opening of Myanmar, formerly and still known by many as Burma, by sending the first American ambassador in 22 years, easing sanctions and meeting with Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi in Washington.
Later Monday he was to announce the return of the United States Agency for International Development along with $170 million for projects over the next two years, noting that in his inaugural address he had vowed to reach out to those ''willing to unclench your fist.''
''So today, I have come to keep my promise and extend the hand of friendship,'' read the text of prepared remarks to be delivered at the University of Yangon. He promised to ''help rebuild an economy'' and develop new institutions that can be sustained. ''The flickers of progress that we have seen must not be extinguished -- they must become a shining north star for all this nation's people.''
Although human rights activists criticized his visit as premature because of remaining political prisoners and unsettled violence racking parts of the country, Mr. Obama used the occasion to nudge Myanmar to move further. He noted that democracy is about constraints on power, pointing to his own limits as president.
''That is how you must reach for the future you deserve,'' he said in the prepared remarks, ''a future where a single prisoner of conscience is one too many and the law is stronger than any leader, where no child is made to be a soldier and no woman is exploited, where national security is strengthened by a military that serves under civilians and a constitution guarantees that only those who are elected by the people may govern.''
Under Mr. Thein Sein, a former general, many political prisoners have been released and media restrictions have been eased. Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi's party, the National League for Democracy, was allowed to run in elections and she won a seat in parliament. Even before Air Force One landed here, Mr. Thein Sein offered a further gesture.
His office announced that the government would set up a process to review the fate of remaining political prisoners by the end of the year, allow international human rights organizations more access to prisons and conflict zones and take ''decisive action'' to stop violence against the country's minority Muslim population.
More than 200 political prisoners remain in custody, and the government has waged a brutal campaign against insurgents in Kachin State. Human Rights Watch said Sunday that satellite imagery showed violence, arson and extensive destruction of homes in Rohingya Muslim areas in Arakan State by ethnic Arakans in October, which it said was carried out with support of state security forces and local government officials.
John Sifton of Human Rights Watch said that if the promises Mr. Thein Sein announced Monday were kept, it would ''be a huge step in the right direction for the people'' and future of Myanmar, although he maintained it could have been achieved without rewarding the government with a presidential visit so soon.
During a stop in Thailand on Sunday, Mr. Obama defended his decision to travel to Myanmar. ''This is not an endorsement of the Burmese government,'' he said. ''This is an acknowledgment that there is a process under way inside that country that even a year and a half, two years ago, nobody foresaw.''
He added: ''I don't think anybody's under any illusion that Burma's arrived, that they're where they need to be. On the other hand, if we waited to engage until they achieved a perfect democracy, my suspicion is we'd be waiting an awful long time.''
Myanmar is the second stop on Mr. Obama's three-country swing through Southeast Asia. He spent Sunday in Bangkok, visiting America's oldest ally in the region, and planned to head next to Cambodia for summit meetings with leaders from throughout the region. It will also be the first time an American president has visited that country, but there are few of the same stirrings of reform in Cambodia, which is dominated by Prime Minister Hun Sen, a former Khmer Rouge commander.
Even in Thailand, considered the most modern and sophisticated of the three countries on Mr. Obama's itinerary, the state of the country's political system has been precarious, particularly since Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra was ousted in a military coup in 2006. His sister, Yingluck Shinawatra, became prime minister last year, and Mr. Obama praised her for her support of democracy. Human rights groups, however, still identify problems including security force abuses, restrictions on free speech and the failure to protect a large population of refugees, asylum seekers and migrant workers.
Mr. Obama made no mention of that in his remarks to reporters in Bangkok and addressed it only when a Thai reporter asked about problems with freedom in his country. The president offered no criticism of his host.
''Democracy is not something that is static,'' he said. ''It's something that we constantly have to work on.''
The embrace of Myanmar fits into a larger effort by the Obama administration to reorient American foreign policy more toward Asia and to engage the countries on China's periphery at a time of nervousness in the region about Beijing's increasing assertiveness. Myanmar was for years locked solidly in China's orbit, but its move toward the West in the last two years has been driven at least partly by resentment of Beijing's rapacious exploitation of natural resources here.
For Mr. Obama, it also represents one of the few relatively unvarnished success stories in the democratic movement that he can point to during his time in office. By contrast, the Arab Spring set of revolutions in the Middle East have now become bogged down in more ambiguous outcomes, as in Libya, where Islamic extremists attacked a United States diplomatic mission in Benghazi in September, killing the ambassador and three other Americans.
None of that anti-American sentiment was on display here Monday. He was greeted at the airport by a delegation swathed in greens, purples and turquoise, a young girl presenting a bouquet and a military honor guard in white dress uniforms with red trim. Some who watched his motorcade pass waved American flags and chanted, ''America.'' Thus began a visit during which Mr. Obama and his hosts were to focus on progress with the understanding that hard work still remained.

HEADLINE: Back on Hill, Ryan Remains A Fiscal Force

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Gone is the private jet and the motorcade that swept him from the tarmac to the private hotel entrances. His security staff has been reduced to a few Capitol Police officers, soon to fade away. Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin is back to driving his own truck back home, and walking to the House floor here for votes alone, like everyone else.
But while the campaign trappings and the high profile of the national campaign are behind him, Mr. Ryan now finds himself at the center of one of the biggest fiscal negotiations in a generation.
Speaker John A. Boehner has tapped Mr. Ryan, who has returned to his post as the House Budget Committee chairman after an unsuccessful run for vice president, to help strike a deal to avoid big tax increases and spending cuts by the end of the year, and to bring along fellow Republicans. 
''He helps us toward creating a product,'' said Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, ''and he helps sell the product.''
The test will be whether Mr. Ryan -- who declined last year to sit on another Congressional committee charged with taming the deficit, in large part because doing so might have hurt his prospects for national office -- can make the transition from House budget philosopher to governing heavyweight who can help negotiate a bipartisan deal and sell it to his colleagues.
While President Obama and the Democrats are expected to give ground on entitlements and discretionary spending, it is likely that Mr. Ryan will be the player under the most pressure to back away from his previous conservative positions in order to form a bipartisan agreement.
Mr. Ryan, who declined to be interviewed, was largely silent during the campaign about his call for changes to the Medicare system and for vast cuts to government services, as outlined in his House budget. But his distaste for Mr. Obama's fiscal theories was unambiguous. At the Republican convention, for example, he called the Obama administration's economic vision ''a dull, adventureless journey from one entitlement to the next, a government-planned life, a country where everything is free but us.''
With his new muscle and increased respect from his colleagues, Mr. Ryan could conceivably scuttle any deal if he loudly opposes a solution that the speaker and the top Republican leaders embrace. But his conservative base might rebel against him if he were to endorse any deal seen as awarding too much to Mr. Obama and the Democrats, particularly on tax rates. Some Republicans think the pitfalls are dangerous enough that Mr. Ryan might consider leaving Congress altogether to work on his policy agenda without the inherent headaches of the Hill.
''He has to think about what he wants his role to be,'' said Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma. ''Is he going to run in 2016, or run for something else in Wisconsin, or play a bigger role in the House? He's going to play an outsize role here because of the national profile he now has, but on the other hand, this conference is quite happy to act independently.''
Not all Republicans are quite so charmed by Mr. Ryan. He has engendered some exasperation among appropriators and other members who have been forced to apply his stringent budget numbers to their spending bills. Further, in the first test of his postelection influence, Mr. Ryan aggressively supported two conservative candidates for House leadership roles who failed in their bids.
For all the attention it attracted during the campaign, the Ryan budget, unlike other types of legislation, is a nonbinding agreement that does not go through the rigors of a conference committee.
Mr. Ryan has returned to the Hill voicing support for Mr. Boehner, a departure from last year, when he was wary of bipartisan deficit solutions, including the one Mr. Boehner tried to negotiate with the president.
''Speaker Boehner has outlined a bipartisan way forward to avoid the 'fiscal cliff' and get our economy growing,'' said Conor Sweeney, Mr. Ryan's spokesman, ''with common-sense entitlement reform coupled with pro-growth tax reform. We can find common ground on responsible spending restraint and greater revenue through economic growth, but we have yet to see either a serious plan or leadership from President Obama.''
Democrats, who recognize Mr. Ryan's ability to pull his fellow Republicans into a deal, are also skeptical of his role.
''I find it very fascinating,'' said Senator Patty Murray, a Democrat from Washington State who will become the Senate Budget Committee chairwoman, ''because his vision was actually on the ballot and Americans decided to go in a different direction.''
While Ms. Murray noted that Mr. Boehner was the official leader of the House Republicans and that she found the speaker's recent conciliatory tone ''encouraging,'' she said Mr. Ryan's impact was a wild card. ''If he is bringing Ryan in to have his budget of the past as the present stance,'' she said, ''it is going to be long row to hoe. If they are bringing Ryan in to listen and compromise, that will represent a path forward.''
Mr. Ryan, who was as shocked by his ticket's loss as Mitt Romney was, spent the morning after the election in a Boston hotel eating breakfast with his family and ruminating about what they had been through, his brother Tobin Ryan said.
Contrary to his fear that a campaign would wear him down, aides said, Mr. Ryan was invigorated by the race. He particularly enjoyed his time spent in Iowa, where his wife, Janna, visited her grandmother's home for the first time in many years.
''There was certainly a little bit of a fog immediately after,'' Tobin Ryan said. ''We shared our thoughts, and I think as a family it made us even closer.''
That day, Mr. Boehner called Mr. Ryan to go over the statement the speaker would make later that day on Capitol Hill, signaling a softened approach to a budget deal. Three of Mr. Boehner's aides who served on Mr. Ryan's campaign made their way back to town.
Mr. Ryan, joined by his two brothers, then went pheasant hunting, dropping so far out of the news cycle that he was only vaguely aware of the controversy brewing over the attack on the American mission in Benghazi, Libya. ''There is no better medicine for Paul,'' Tobin Ryan said, ''than getting out in the fresh air and water with dogs looking for some birds.''
When Mr. Ryan returned to Capitol Hill last week, he was met with a standing ovation from his Republican colleagues, a bear hug from Mr. Boehner and the hope from conservatives that he would hold the line on taxes and other spending.
''I hope he's front and center in this debate,'' said Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, who is the departing chairman of the conservative Republican Study Committee. ''He's probably our best spokesperson for how serious this debt situation is.''
According to aides and others close to Mr. Ryan, he is as focused on doing the job before him as he was on winning the vice-presidential race. ''We just sort of picked ourselves back up, and we are all back into our lives and jobs,'' Tobin Ryan said. ''And frankly, I see Paul doing the same thing.''

HEADLINE: In Wyoming, Conservatives Feeling Left Behind

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
CHEYENNE, Wyo. -- By now, voters here are over the initial shock. The ranchers, businessmen and farmers across this deep-red state who knew, just knew that Americans would never re-elect a liberal tax-and-spender president have grudgingly accepted the reality that voters did just that.
But since the election, a blanket of baffled worry has descended on conservatives here like early snow across the plains, deepening a sense that traditional, rural and overwhelmingly white states in the center of the country are losing touch with an increasingly diverse and urban American electorate.
''It's a fundamental shift,'' said Khale Lenhart, 27, a lawyer here. ''It's a mind-set change -- that government is here to take care of me.'' 
The share of white voters -- and white men, specifically -- shrank in this election as turnout grew among blacks, Hispanics and Asian-Americans, whose support for President Obama more than compensated for his losses among whites, exit polls showed. An analysis by the Pew Research Center found that minority voters had made up 28 percent of the electorate, up from 26 percent in 2008, a proportion expected to grow.
''Welcome to the next America,'' said Paul Taylor, executive vice president at Pew. ''Whatever that vote looked like this year, four years from now it'll be more so, and eight years from now it'll be even more so.''
None of this ensures election wins for Democrats. The tide of minority voters that helped elect Mr. Obama in 2008 ebbed just two years later in a welter of populist anger over budget deficits, job losses and Mr. Obama's agenda, allowing Republicans to retake the House and make gains in the Senate in the midterm elections. And there is no guarantee that the next Democratic presidential candidate will match Mr. Obama's huge margins or turnout with minority voters.
Still, if diversity is the future of American politics, conservatives in places like Wyoming, the least populous state, where 86 percent of residents are white, fear they may be sliding into the past.
Republican explanations for Mitt Romney's loss -- that Democrats turned out the urban vote, that the United States is no longer its ''traditional'' self, or that Mr. Obama had showered ''gifts'' on women, minorities and young voters -- resonated in some conservative political circles here in the state capital.
''It spooks me,'' said James Yates, 46, a self-made businessman who owns 15 restaurants and employs about 1,000 people. ''The young vote and certainly the minority vote went toward the perspective of 'What can I get?' Where the government runs everything, it's completely not sustainable. They don't see that.''
People said their worries about the next four more years had little to do with Mr. Obama's race, or even Democratic policies on abortion, same-sex marriage and birth control. Wyoming's conservatism has some strong libertarian hues. What worries conservatives here is that an increasingly diverse and Democratic polity will embrace health care mandates, higher domestic spending and a bigger government role in people's economic lives.
Nobody ever expected Wyoming to support Mr. Obama; Lyndon Johnson was the last Democrat to win its three electoral votes, in 1964. In a year when voters nationally sent more Democrats to Congress, supported same-sex marriage measures and legalized marijuana in two states, voters here increased the already large Republican majority in the State House, maintained it in the State Senate and expressed their opposition to the president's health care law.
Mr. Romney won his second-largest victory here, beating Mr. Obama 69 percent to 28 percent. Only Utah, with its large Mormon population, favored Mr. Romney by a wider margin.
One of Wyoming's newly elected officials is M. Lee Hasenauer, who runs a tree-trimming service and just won a two-year seat as a Laramie County commissioner. His views, described as ''pretty out there'' by fellow conservatives in the state, are that Mr. Obama won through voter fraud, that the country is veering leftward toward fiscal ruin and that something fundamental is now different about American politics.
He was bewildered by the results on Election Day.
''I thought Romney was a shoo-in,'' he said. ''Something is way wrong. It may take a revolution to straighten out our government.''
His friend Bradley Harrington, who publishes a year-old conservative newspaper called Liberty's Torch and is the host of a radio talk show in Cheyenne, said the election vindicated conservative politicians and commentators who talked about the 47 percent of Americans who pay no income tax, about makers and takers.
''The parasites now outnumber the producers,'' Mr. Harrington said. ''That's why Romney lost, and I think it's going to get worse.''
Jeff Prince, 42, a financial adviser, invoked John F. Kennedy's famous inaugural question to describe what he saw as the difference between conservative, self-reliant Wyoming and liberal precincts along the coasts and in cities.
''They think, 'What can he do for me?' as opposed to what Kennedy said in the '60s, 'What can I do for my country?' '' Mr. Prince said.
That mentality of fierce independence is complicated by land and money. The government owns half the land in Wyoming, as national forest, parkland or other state land, and the natural resources here have long padded state coffers.
A 2011 study by the Pew States Project found that Wyoming received more federal funds per resident than any other state, largely because of royalties from mining and drilling. That $3,757 per person went to health care, transportation, education and other government programs.
But voters in Wyoming have little control in the management of those lands. Washington, they say, determines which lands are opened for drilling, the environmental reviews on oil drilling, whether wolves are a protected species or fair game for hunters. They see a portent in drilling plans proposed by the Interior Department that would close 1.6 million acres of federal land to oil-shale exploration.
Middle-aged white men here bristled at the notion that they were now the Republican Party's last constituency. Look at Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, they said, or at Gov. Susana Martinez of New Mexico; Mia Love, a black Mormon mayor in Utah; or Lynn Hutchings, a newly elected black state representative. But they said Republicans would need to talk differently about immigration, reproductive issues and income inequality if they wanted to win over voters outside places like this one.
After all, as Buck Holmes, a county commissioner-elect here and self-described ''sensible conservative'' put it: ''Not everyone thinks the same way as Wyoming conservatives do.''

Jeff Prince, left, and Khale Lenhart said they worried that voters would become reliant on the government. ''It's a mind-set change,'' Mr. Lenhart said.

HEADLINE: Of Parents, Puppies and Robots

BYLINE: NANCY FOLBRE


HIGHLIGHT: Methods of assessing the cost and benefits of children often fail to acknowledge the broader benefits that they bring society, particularly in caring for older generations, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Nancy Folbre is an economics professor at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. 
A fascinating fight over the children broke out last week. A post on the Bucks blog of The New York Times on the costs of parenting followed by a post on the Times's Motherlode blog on the benefits of parenting generated more than 700 comments from readers, mostly aimed at one another. The exchanges reveal intense disagreement about how to define the costs and benefits. 
They also testify to a persistent tendency to frame decisions to rear children as mere consumption decisions, similar to decisions to bring home puppies. If you want children, you should make them or adopt them and happily pay for the flow of psychic benefits you hope to receive. You should probably reach for at least an approximate estimate of the cost, if only to ensure the future well-being of those you care for. 
Missing from this emphasis on individual decision-making is any serious consideration of the impact of child-rearing on the economy as a whole. Most of those who focus on unintended or "spillover" effects seem to concentrate on the public bads, insisting that child-rearing itself has a negative impact on environmental sustainability, regardless of the rate of population growth or level of other forms of consumption. 
The Motherlode author KJ Dell'Antonia, along with some readers responding to both blog posts, noted that children grow up to contribute positively to the economy in general and to the care of the older generation in particular. As she put it, "Capitalism, that masterful force, can't function without fresh people on which to exert its incentives." 
I would put this a bit differently. Capitalism, that masterful force, would have to pay much more for workers if families weren't willing to pony up most of the time, money and effort necessary to raise them, train them and educate them.

Imagine a world in which businesses could largely rely on highly customized battery-powered robots but would require some humans to design, build and program them. In a competitive market, the price of robots would be determined by the cost of producing them, including the wages demanded by their human producers. 
What a boon it would be to businesses - and to their consumers - if some humans so loved the process of creating robots that they were willing to do so for free, happily lavishing their own resources on the production of ever-more beautiful and skilled models. Their love and commitment would obviously lower the cost of robot production, and businesses relying on robots would have to pay little beyond the costs of recharging and minor repairs (analogous to the cost of wages and health insurance for human workers). 
Set aside, in this science fiction scenario, the issue of how human workers would obtain resources in a world in which there is little demand for their labor (heads up, fans of "I, Robot"). Note, only in passing, the tragic irony of human workers contributing to their own obsolescence, as it seems likely that they will eventually devise robots that can reproduce themselves (heads up, fans of "Battlestar Galactica"). 
Focus, instead, on how human motivation to raise children creates benefits not only for children themselves but for all those who rely on the labor those children will provide or the taxes they will pay. 
Our standard economic accounting system ignores the value of goods and services that lack a market price - including clean air and a stable climate, as well as the health and well-being of our human resources. 
Nature instructs us in the danger of ignoring the value of unpriced inputs into the output we label gross domestic product. Efforts to assign a dollar value to ecosystem services are analogous to efforts to assign a dollar value to the work parents do and better estimate the costs of children. 
Sometimes it seems to me that science fiction is the only way to drive this point home. 
Consider the following strategy for cutting the deficit and speeding economic growth. End all public spending on health, education and retirement. Export all our children and elderly to low-wage countries where they can get cheaper care. Open our borders to the healthiest and best-educated immigrants of the world with the proviso that they will be deported when they get pregnant, sick or old. 
How mean and stupid we could be. How rich we could become.

HEADLINE: In Defense of Sustained Research on Fusion

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: The director of a fusion laboratory says the United States can't afford to lose momentum on work toward a transformative energy source. 

 BODY:
Stewart C. Prager, the director of the Department of Energy's Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory and a professor of astrophysical sciences at Princeton University, here offers a fresh defense of continued substantial support for research on extracting usable energy from nuclear fusion.
His "Your Dot" contribution builds on a recent fusion post by Burton Richter, a Nobelist in physics and author of a valuable book on energy, and another from Robert L. Hirsch, who directed the country's fusion energy program in the 1970s. Here's Prager's post:

The Way Forward with Magnetic Fusion Energy 
By Stewart C. Prager, Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory 
As budget negotiations heat up, so does the debate over the balance between investments in the long-term future and short-term necessities. Fusion is a long-term opportunity that will transform how we energize our society. The fact that ignition in a large American experimental inertial confinement fusion facility did not occur as hoped by Sept. 30 has sadly raised questions about the scientific legitimacy of that pursuit. That the scientists did not meet their goal by that day probably has little bearing on that field's ultimate success. Importantly, this non-event should not bear any relation to the fate of other vital work centering on an entirely different approach known as magnetic fusion. 
We need to keep our eyes on fusion as a transformative source of energy for the world. There are many powerful reasons why we need to forge ahead.
The magnificent lasers at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory's National Ignition Facility are aimed to compress a pellet of fusion fuel such that it "ignites" - converts the energy of the lasers that bombard the pellet into fusion energy. The lasers work spectacularly well but the problem of fusion ignition is scientifically rich and complex. So far at least, the pellets have not yet behaved as expected and the milestone of ignition has not yet been achieved. This, of course, should not dull interest in the American inertial confinement fusion program: Not achieving a major scientific result by a pre-determined and artificial deadline is far from a failure.
Further, the fact that conquering this complex problem in laser fusion has not been "on schedule" has nothing to say about progress in magnetic fusion - it has been and continues to be remarkable.
Those with a long memory will recall the very early optimism about fusion energy that existed in the late 1950s and 1960s. On the heels of the quick success in moving fission energy forward, it was thought practical fusion would follow closely behind. Instead, the world's scientists ran into an unexpected barrier -- the immense physics complexity and seeming impossibility of taming fusion plasmas.
The ensuing decades have seen an intense scientific focus on what is truly a grand scientific challenge. Scientists now are teasing out the secrets of complex multi-scaled layers of turbulence in plasmas, the movement of particles through those plasmas, their interaction with magnetic fields, and numerous other phenomena that impact the plasma's ability to be harnessed as an energy source. This focus in magnetic fusion has driven the development of a new scientific field, plasma physics, with huge benefits for science in general - from understanding cosmic plasmas to employing these hot, ionized gases for computer chip manufacturing.
On the energy front, we have advanced from fusion energy production of milliwatts in the 1970s to 16 megawatts (for a duration of 1 second) in the 1990s. With our existing underpowered machines, magnetic fusion scientists are producing and producing close to fusion energy-grade plasmas around the world on a daily basis. We are confident that abundant fusion energy can be produced on a very large scale and are now focused on the remaining physics and engineering challenges to make it practical and attractive.
The next major experimental step in magnetic fusion is ITER - the international experiment that will generate 500 megawatts of fusion power, at a physical scale of a power plant. Under construction in France, ITER will begin operation within ten years. It involves participation of the entire developed world, with the ITER partners representing the governments of half the world's population. The scientific basis for ITER was separately scrutinized and approved by scientific panels in each of these nations. ITER is large, complex, and full of challenges. But, the likelihood of scientific success is high.
Most nations involved in ITER have robust fusion research programs that are essential to tackle other key scientific and technical issues. With these accompanying programs, we would be ready to operate a demonstration fusion power plant following ITER about 25 years from today.
The charge by some that both inertial and magnetic fusion have been beset with failure is unwarranted. These include remarks in a commentary by Dr. Burton Richter in the Oct. 18 Dot Earth blog: "Both approaches have gone from failure to ever larger failure, but each time a great deal has been learned "
In fairness, the comment is preceded by brief, informative technical capsules. As a fusion-knowledgeable scientist who does not work in fusion energy research, Dr. Richter includes some supportive comments for the fusion program, tempered by discerning skepticism. But, for fusion scientists, Dr. Richter's comments on failure are difficult to understand. We are unaware of any major project failures in magnetic fusion research. Quite the opposite: One of the key reasons that ITER was funded across the world is that a series of ever larger experiments have been so successful as to provide confidence that the yet larger ITER will be similarly successful.
Other commentary has appeared, offering incorrect information. In a separate Dot Earth commentary concerning magnetic fusion on Oct. 19, Dr. Robert Hirsch, an administrator of the fusion energy program at the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission in the 1970s, offers views reflecting the state of the field at the time of his departure from the AEC some 35 years ago. His view is framed by stating that fusion must be made practical, which means economically and technologically attractive. This is certainly correct and indeed, the criteria for such practicality have provided significant guidance to fusion research for decades. Dr. Hirsch cites a series of challenges that he thinks are roadblocks, but are not. He worries that the energy stored by superconducting magnets poses a serious threat and regulatory burden. This is not so. ITER has proven otherwise. France's strict nuclear regulatory authorities have concluded the magnets pose no radiological safety concerns for the public. Dr. Hirsch states that the radioactive materials of a fusion reactor will be a major problem. This also is not so. The amount and toxicity is orders of magnitude less than for fission. Dr. Hirsch would be interested to learn that the rigorous French licensing regime is very successfully nearing completion. Licensing, although requiring significant efforts, will not be a barrier to fusion.
Some, like Dr Hirsch, have suggested that fusion machines are so large and complex that they will never be cost competitive. No one knows the ultimate costs, but our best engineering analyses indicate that, with some luck, fusion can indeed be cost- competitive. As an alternative to the mainline approaches to fusion energy, Dr. Hirsch puts forth his research idea from the 1970s of inertial electrostatic confinement (IEC). I agree that the fusion program very much needs to pursue multiple approaches, even within magnetic fusion. But extensive peer review has found IEC far more difficult to achieve than the ITER and related approaches in magnetic fusion.
Fusion is a nearly ideal energy source - essentially inexhaustible, clean, safe, and likely available to all nations. When proven practical, it will transform our energy future. At this moment, research investment by the rest of the world - China, Korea, the EU - is surging in magnetic fusion, while the U.S. investment is stagnating. The U.S. is at a turning point. We either maintain our long-developed leadership position in this energy and science frontier, or slip behind as other nations take the fruit of decades of scientific research - much of it from the U.S. - and convert it into a practical energy source for powering the world.

 The Fiscal Cliff: Better Than It Looks 
The budget deficit widened in October. Robert Rubin writes: ""Now that the election is over, Washington's attention is consumed by the looming combination of automatic spending cuts and tax increases known as the fiscal cliff. That combination poses risks, including economic contraction and erosion of confidence in government. But it also offers a chance to address our unsustainable and dangerous fiscal trajectory." Kent Hoover analyzes four tax deals Congress can make to avert the fiscal cliff. Try out these five fiscal-cliff situations. Small and midsize manufacturers are already being hit by defense spending cuts. Bruce Bartlett believes that "our long-term fiscal future is better than it looks." The United States is projected to be the world's top oil producer in five years (but these two do not appear to be impressed).

 The Week's Best 
 Kayla Albert explains how failure can help you succeed: "Your failure can offer powerful insight to those around you. We are often very reluctant to share our failures with others because we are allowing ourselves to be vulnerable to criticism. But the truth is, being open about failure allows others to collect on the lessons we learned ourselves, and in speaking about it, we are more likely to become aware of what all of the takeaways were. We learn a great deal about life from the experiences of others, so the collective experience of failure among the entire human race allows us to steer our lives down a more positive, productive path. Therefore, there is no failure that doesn't have the ability to help someone, somewhere."
 Chris Brogan says social media isn't dead, but it's boring. "It's boring to talk simply about the tools because the tools are just a way to reach people. We can argue the details endlessly (I don't believe much in Klout, for instance), and we can announce the premature death of Tumblr, Twitter, Facebook and whoever. But it doesn't matter. When we talk about restaurants (the tools), we mostly talk about the food (the content). When we talk about bands (tools), we talk about whether the music resonates (the content). When we talk about a good book (the content), we never ask what type of computer it was written on (the tools)."
 James Fallows has a strategy for avoiding Petraeus-style e-mail disasters: "Never put anything in an e-mail message, to anyone, that would cause you serious problems if it fell into the wrong hands."

HEADLINE: Taming the 'Foreign Agents'

BYLINE: MASHA GESSEN


HIGHLIGHT: Official Russia now sees all foreign aid as probably hostile and all foreigners as likely enemies. 

 BODY:
MOSCOW - The road from little-known Russian-American nongovernmental organization to enemy of the state is traveled quickly.
First, your e-mail accounts are hacked. Second, a Kremlin-friendly tabloid publishes your internal and external correspondence. Third, a somewhat more reputable Kremlin-friendly tabloid publishes an analysis of the correspondence, concluding that your aim is to circumvent Russian law, implying that your ultimate aim is to bring down the regime. Fourth, the press secretary of the pro-Kremlin youth movement, as well as the movement's former press secretary, alert their sizable Twitter and blog followings to your leaked correspondence.
Fifth, a politician who is known to shoot off his mouth in ways that seem spontaneous and rogue but in fact are an almost-perfect predictor of what the Kremlin will say, accuses you of being "anti-Russian." Sixth, the mainstream media pick up on the scandal. Seventh, the state news agency puts out a seemingly objective report that says you refuse to comment on "allegations of anti-Russianness." Eighth, we don't yet know what happens next, but my guess is, you are ordered to cease and desist. 
So goes the story of the U.S. Russia Foundation, a donor fund that supports projects on the rule of law, institution building and economic development. The foundation is relatively new - it was registered in its current form in 2008 - and relatively small compared with the U.S. Agency for International Development, which was kicked out of Russia a couple of months ago. 
The U.S.R.F. has toiled in relative obscurity, drawing mostly the attention of those who could benefit from its money or its expertise - like the Yegor Gaidar Foundation, which honors the memory of Russia's first reformist prime minister and used U.S.R.F. funds to send undergraduates from the provinces on summer scholarships to the United States, or like the Russian Arbitrage Court, which sent its judges to the United States to learn about bankruptcy laws and procedures.
Last summer, Parliament adopted a law that subjects Russian NGOs that receive foreign funding to increased tax scrutiny and requires them to identify themselves in all public forums as "foreign agents." Then, on Oct. 1, Usaid was summarily kicked out of the country. Neither measure directly affected the U.S.R.F. (it is not a Russian NGO, nor is it Usaid) but both reflected the new position of official Russia, which sees all foreign aid as probably hostile and all foreigners as likely enemies.
Viewed through that lens, the hacked U.S.R.F. correspondence was damning. A letter listing some of the group's activities mentioned journalism training. "This is the limit," wrote a pro-Kremlin blogger, using a term unsuitable for a family newspaper. "These guys are openly saying that they 'teach journalists' the right way to cover trials."
They are, and they do, and a few years ago this seemed like normal, even common, practice (I personally conducted many similar training sessions, funded by the European Union), but in the new Russian mentality the very idea that Americans may be teaching something to Russian journalists sounds, well, criminal.
In another letter, the U.S.R.F. president, Mark Pomar, asked an employee to write up short bios of several members of the Russian cabinet. "U.S.R.F. helps the U.S. administration to collect information on Russian officials," commented the blogger. "The purpose of this is unclear." But clearly sinister.
Finally, in another email a staff member wrote that Pomar had been buoyed by protest marches in Moscow and other cities. In this context, it almost sounds like Pomar organized them himself. And considering that the Kremlin believes the protests to be directed not just against the regime but against the country itself, it is no wonder that the U.S.R.F. stands accused of being anti-Russian. 
I talked to Pomar on the phone Sunday night, four days after the story broke. He seemed to be reeling from the negative publicity that has engulfed him. "Do they not like us for what we do or for who we are?" he asked, pointing to the fact that none of the criticism actually concerns actions the foundation has taken or programs it has funded. Digging out a printout from what he described as a pile of bad press on his desk, Pomar read out a headline: A Russian legal expert was saying, "U.S.R.F. activities will harm Russian interests." 
I would expect that in the coming days or weeks the U.S.R.F. will be told to get out of Russia. A few more Russian students will lose the opportunity to spend a summer studying abroad; several more Russian judges will be denied exposure to established legal procedures outside of their country. Russia will become yet a little bit more isolated.
