Pricewaterhouse Sells Consulting Firm to I.B.M.
I.B.M. plans to buy PricewaterhouseCoopers Consulting for $3.5 billion in a move that will accelerate its shift toward selling information technology to corporate customers instead of stand-alone hardware and software products.
 For PricewaterhouseCoopers, the deal is a way to separate its accounting and consulting businesses. In selling to I.B.M., it is abandoning a plan to sell shares in the consulting firm to the public and base the business in the tax haven of Bermuda. Page A1. 

Fox Shuns Ads for Sept. 11 Specials
Fox and Fox News Channel will not accept advertisements or sponsorships for their coverage of the one-year commemoration of the Sept. 11 attacks. The decisions come at a time when networks are having a hard time attracting sponsors to their 9/11 programs. C12.

Vanguard Airlines Files Bankruptcy
Vanguard Airlines, which had been in business since 1994, filed for bankruptcy protection after operating since Sept. 11 on a diminishing pool of cash. Vanguard's announcement came on the same day that federal officials said they had turned down the airline for a loan guarantee. Vanguard had applied for backing on nearly all of an $8 million loan.

Debate Shifts on Chemical in Food
Most of the debate has died down over whether starchy foods contain acrylamide, a potential carcinogen. No longer is there much doubt that the chemical forms in certain carbohydrates after they are baked or fried. But it will probably take years to figure out how much danger, if any, acrylamide poses. C2.

The disclosure about starchy foods and acrylamide has produced strange bedfellows. Consumer and industry groups hope to use the courts to make different points about acrylamide and a California law. F3.

HEADLINE: Powell Treading a Thin Line In Rallying Antiterror Support 

BYLINE:  By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN, Brunei, July 30 

 BODY:
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell arrived here tonight for meetings with fellow foreign ministers aimed at solidifying a second front, in Southeast Asia, in the campaign against global terrorism. But he has had to balance that goal with longstanding concerns about human rights abuses in the region.
 In meetings today in Malaysia and Singapore before touching down in this oil-producing sultanate for two days of talks with members of the Association of South East Asian Nations, Secretary Powell said, he repeatedly raised the issue. "We still believe strongly in human rights, and that everything we do has to be consistent with universal standards of human rights," he said. 
 But at a news conference in Singapore, Secretary Powell hinted that the Bush administration was ready to discuss resuming military cooperation with Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim nation and a sometimes reluctant partner in the efforts to crack down on militant Islamic groups. The United States cut virtually all military links with Indonesia in 1999 after its forces were implicated in the violence that swept East Timor after that territory voted for independence.
On Thursday, Secretary Powell and representatives of the 10 nations of the Asian group, including Indonesia, are expected to sign a declaration promising cooperation to prevent terrorism by sharing information, blocking funds, tightening borders and making it hard to use forged travel papers.
"We recognized that terrorism is a global threat and that the disturbing acts of terrorism and transnational crimes, which continue to threaten world peace and stability, must be tackled by the international community," the 10 ministers said in a communique today.
Secretary Powell is among the representatives from 13 nations outside Southeast Asia, including China, Japan and Russia, that are taking part in the annual meeting of the group's regional forum. Terrorism dominates the agenda.
Secretary Powell heads to Indonesia's capital, Jakarta, late Thursday before finishing a weeklong trip through the region in the Philippines on Saturday. He said that when he arrives in Jakarta, he will have "some ideas and some initiatives" to present to President Megawati Sukarnoputri.
Indonesia is already receiving $400,000 in the current fiscal year for civilian training programs and is to receive a like amount next year, and the United States expects to provide an additional $16 million this year to train police officers in counterterrorism. At the same time, the Pentagon is reviewing how to allocate another $17 million in "counterterrorism fellowships," some of which could go to Indonesia. 
But a senior State Department official also acknowledged that some in the administration and Congress are pushing for more direct military cooperation, which would require Congressional approval.
"I think they recognize the danger that we all face and I think they have been cooperating more fully with us as time goes by, and I'm quite sure that Mrs. Megawati is committed to this cause," Secretary Powell said in Singapore. He met there with Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, who endorsed the idea of renewed military ties between the United States and Indonesia as an important step in stabilizing that country.
Secretary Powell contended that it was not inconsistent to want to foster cooperation even with an organization like the Indonesian military, which has a history of human rights abuses. "If you get young officers, expose them to a military organization that is within a democratic political institution, such as the United States, then that rubs off on them," he said.
In Malaysia, Secretary Powell met with Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who has led the country since 1981. The Malaysian foreign minister, Syed Hamid Albar, later told local reporters that Secretary Powell had proposed that American and Malaysian officials review the idea of forming a regional training center in Malaysia to coordinate antiterrorism activities.
His brief stop in Malaysia also highlighted the moral ambiguities of the effort to prevent terrorism and its emphasis on cooperation with governments that the United States has often criticized.
The United States once distanced itself from Prime Minister Mahathir for strong-arm tactics with political rivals, and human rights groups criticize him for arresting and jailing scores of suspected militants, including some who may be linked to Al Qaeda, without trial.
Secretary Powell said his discussions with Mr. Mahathir "touched on the case" of his former deputy, Anwar Ibrahim, who is serving a 15-year sentence on charges of sodomy and abuse of power after trials that Secretary Powell said the United States had "always felt" were flawed.
The assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, James Kelly, met this morning with Mr. Anwar's wife, Wan Azizah Wan Ismail, for what she later told Malaysian reporters was a discussion about both the detention of her husband and six supporters, and the campaign against terrorism.

HEADLINE: Metro Briefing New York: Manhattan: Consumer Confidence Falls 

BYLINE:  By Leslie Eaton (NYT) 

 BODY:
 New Yorkers are feeling more uneasy about the economy than at any other time since September, according to a new survey by the Siena Research Institute. The monthly survey, done jointly with the University of Michigan, found a sharp drop in confidence among New York City residents in July, as the index of economic confidence fell to 73.5, from 83.3 in June; it was 72.0 in September. 
A similar index developed for the Conference Board, a business group, found confidence had fallen to September's level of 83.7, from 84.2 in June in the Middle Atlantic states. Economists said the stock market and corporate scandals have shaken consumer confidence, which may lead them to save rather than spend money. Leslie Eaton (NYT)

HEADLINE: Budget Deficit in Philippines Damages Investor Confidence 

BYLINE:  By WAYNE ARNOLD 

DATELINE: SINGAPORE, July 30 

 BODY:
The arrival of American troops in the Philippines to help the country fight Muslim rebels coincided with a surge in investor optimism over the government's economic goals. Six months later, that optimism is fading.
 The government's promise not to let its budget deficit swell beyond 130 billion pesos ($2.5 billion) has been the chief concern among investors. The day after President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo vowed in her state of the nation address this month to win the war against poverty, officials disclosed that her government was already over budget, with the deficit at 119.7 billion pesos, 92 percent of its target for the year. 
 "The feeling is that they've been overambitious," said Jun Trinidad, an economist with Salomon Smith Barney in Manila. Yet Mrs. Arroyo's government reiterated its promise today, adding that the fight against terrorism and corruption would force it to go even deeper into the red in 2003, although it would result in a lower deficit relative to the growing economy. 
Economists and investors are coming to the conclusion that the government will either have to cut spending or borrow more, a sentiment that has prompted a slide in stock prices. The decline has erased the gains that had made the Philippines one of Asia's hottest markets earlier this year. 
Mrs. Arroyo's budget problems are to some extent inherited. Bled by the regime of former President Ferdinand E. Marcos, the country has turned time and time again to international lenders. Mrs. Arroyo's predecessor, the ousted President Joseph E. Estrada, marked a return to profligacy, with government revenues falling far behind expenditures.
"To blame it all on her is the result of overinflated expectations," said David L. Cohen, director of macroeconomic analysis at Standard & Poor's/MMS in Singapore. 
Mrs. Arroyo impressed foreign investors when her government finished 2001 with a deficit of 147 billion pesos, just 2 billion pesos short of its target for the year. Investors were also impressed by the globetrotting overtures of Mrs. Arroyo's Finance Secretary Jose I. Camacho, a former investment banker at Deutsche Bank and Bankers Trust.
But fiscal discipline has remained beyond Mrs. Arroyo's grasp. Political infighting and fragile markets have held up revenue from the sale of state-owned companies. 
More troublesome is a shortfall in tax revenue, which came in 12 percent below the government's target for the first half of the year. The anemic recoveries in the United States and elsewhere are partly to blame: lower exports mean lower tax revenues.
A larger problem is tax evasion by the richest Philippine individuals and companies. Mrs. Arroyo promised to get tough with tax evaders. Nevertheless, skepticism about the government's goals has battered Philippine financial markets. The stock market is flirting with eight-month lows as foreign investors cash out. For the year, the Philippines market is down nearly 4 percent.

HEADLINE: Debating Iraq 

BYLINE:  By Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Richard G. Lugar; Joseph R. Biden Jr. is the chairman and Richard Lugar the acting ranking Republic member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Through tragedy and pain, Americans have learned a great deal this past year about why foreign policy matters. In recent months, President Bush has made clear his determination to remove Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein from power -- a goal many of us in Congress share. But to date we've seen only leaked reports of competing military plans. These have reflected deep divisions within the administration about whether and how to proceed. The time has come for a serious discussion of American policy toward Iraq.
 The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will begin in-depth hearings today. While the White House supports the hearings -- which have been coordinated closely by Democrats and Republicans on the committee -- administration officials will not participate at this time lest the president be put in the position of having to make critical decisions prematurely. 
 Without prejudging any particular course of action -- including the possibility of staying with nonmilitary options -- we hope to start a national discussion of some critical questions.
First, what threat does Iraq pose to our security? How immediate is the danger? President Bush is right to be concerned about Saddam Hussein's relentless pursuit of weapons of mass destruction. It's true that other regimes hostile to the United States and our allies have, or seek to acquire, chemical, biological and nuclear weapons. What makes Mr. Hussein unique is that he has actually used them -- against his own people and against his Iranian neighbors. And for nearly four years, Iraq has blocked the return of United Nations weapons inspectors. We need to explore Mr. Hussein's track record in acquiring, making and using weapons of mass destruction and the likelihood he would share them with terrorists. We also need a clear assessment of his current capabilities, including conventional forces and weapons. 
Second, what are the possible responses to the Iraqi threat? The containment strategy pursued by the United States since the end of the Persian Gulf war has kept Mr. Hussein boxed in. Continuing the containment strategy, coupled with a tough weapons-inspection program, is one option. But it raises the risk that Mr. Hussein will play cat-and-mouse with inspectors while building more weapons and selling them to those who would use them against us. If we wait for the danger to become clear and present, it may be too late. That is why some believe removing Mr. Hussein from power is the better course.
A military response poses other problems. Some argue that by attacking Mr. Hussein, we might precipitate the very thing we are trying to prevent: his use of weapons of mass destruction. There also is concern he might try to spark a regional war. We must determine whether resources can be shifted to a major military undertaking in Iraq without compromising the war on terror elsewhere. We have to ask how much military intervention would cost and consider its likely impact on our economy. And we need to determine what level of support we are likely to get from allies in the Middle East and Europe.
Third, when Saddam Hussein is gone, what would be our responsibilities? This question has not been explored but may prove to be the most critical. In Afghanistan, the war was prosecuted successfully, but many of us believe our commitment to security and reconstruction there has fallen short. Given Iraq's strategic location, its large oil reserves and the suffering of the Iraqi people, we cannot afford to replace a despot with chaos.
We need to assess what it would take to rebuild Iraq economically and politically. Addressing these questions now would demonstrate to the Iraqi people that we are committed for the long haul. Iraq's neighbors would breathe easier if they knew the future had been thought through in detail. The American people, whose sons and daughters may be put in harm's way, need to have that same sense of assurance. Simply put, we need to know everything possible about the risks of action and of inaction. Ignoring these factors could lead us into something for which the American public is wholly unprepared.

HEADLINE: Governor Pataki Weighs In 

 BODY:
Responding to a wave of public dismay over the first designs for rebuilding Lower Manhattan, Gov. George Pataki has sent word that it's time to go back to the drawing board. It is the right message, sent while it is still early enough to do something constructive about the disappointing quality of the work so far. The governor, like Mayor Michael Bloomberg, now seems committed to creating a better mix of uses for ground zero, and a 24-hour community in Manhattan's downtown. 
 While rethinking the plans will delay the original rebuilding schedule slightly, it does not need to stall progress if the governor keeps the pressure on the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. New York cannot afford to have a gaping hole that mocks the city and its process for rebuilding what was destroyed. 
 Mr. Pataki openly questioned the Port Authority's requirement that any plan for the site must replace all the office, hotel and retail square footage lost in the attack on Sept. 11. More than anything else, that specification limited the designs to the undistinguished options presented two weeks ago. Renegotiating that issue with the World Trade Center leaseholders should begin immediately. Opening the process to other designers, both here and internationally, will help separate this urban plan from the ordinary.
The city also needs to begin openly discussing what happens underground, in particular with the transportation network. At this point, planners have focused on short-term repair of PATH and subway lines, with medium-range proposals being shopped in Washington that could untangle the disorganized web of subway lines downtown. Within the next few weeks the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation and the Port Authority should offer some bigger ideas about how to connect the downtown area better to the rest of the region.
Lowering West Street alongside the World Trade Center site and building a park or esplanade on top is another option that has been popular with those reviewing the first six public proposals. But it would be expensive, and the governor, the mayor and their friends in Washington will have to look at long-range ways to pay the bill.
Governor Pataki's recent remarks are a sign that he understands how central the rebuilding of Lower Manhattan will be to his own political legacy. Now he needs to follow through with action, to keep demonstrating that his core concern is coming up with the best possible plan, not simply keeping the issue on hold until after this fall's election.

HEADLINE: Two Fed Nominees Poised to Advance 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 30 

 BODY:
Two highly regarded nominees for top policy-making spots on the Federal Reserve Board, including one with strongly held views on inflation targets, sped easily through a Senate hearing today.
 Ben S. Bernanke, a Princeton economist who advocates explicit targets for acceptable inflation as a way to keep prices in check, and Donald L. Kohn, a Fed staff member, spent less than an hour answering questions before the Senate Banking Committee. 
The committee chairman, Senator Paul S. Sarbanes of Maryland, said the panel could vote on Wednesday on the two nominees, who would round out the central bank's seven-member board of governors. 
 That would make it possible for the two nominees to win full Senate approval by the end of the week, before Congress adjourns for its August recess. Committee members treated Mr. Bernanke, 48, and Mr. Kohn, 59, with exceptional deference, leaving no doubt that they wanted them on the job swiftly. 
President Bush chose the two as candidates for the Fed board in early May.
Mr. Bernanke is a highly regarded academic expert on monetary policy, and Mr. Kohn is a trusted lieutenant of the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan. If he is appointed, Mr. Kohn would be only the third Fed staff member to be elevated to the board.
Mr. Bernanke repeated his support for adopting targets for inflation, possibly in the range of 1 or 2 percent a year. The Fed does not have a set target for inflation. Mr. Greenspan prefers a more intuitive approach to keeping prices in control and has cited difficulties with precisely measuring inflation as something that could make targeting a problem.

But one thing I haven't seen much planning for is the impact an attack on Iraq would have on the world's oil market. Depending on how the war went, that impact could be very bad and lead to a sharp spike in oil prices, like $60-a-barrel oil. But -- wait a minute -- it could also be very good, and lead to $6-a-barrel oil that would weaken OPEC and, maybe, also weaken the Arab autocrats who depend on high oil prices to finance their illegitimate regimes and buy off opponents.
 Raising this oil question is not an argument against taking down Saddam Hussein. He's a bad man, building dangerous weapons, who has raped the future of two generations of Iraqis. The whole region would be improved by his ouster. It is an argument, though, for thinking through all the dimensions of any attack on Iraq. We're not talking about a war in Tora Bora here. We're talking about a war in the world's main gas station. 
 "A proposed attack on Iraq is an extraordinarily high-risk economic adventure that could either destabilize the governments of one or more oil exporting countries by creating a prolonged period of low prices, or, if things went wrong, lead to a prolonged disruption of world oil supplies, which could be even more devastating," says Philip K. Verleger Jr., an oil expert and fellow of the Council on Foreign Relations.
Let's start with the $60-a-barrel scenario. (The price today is in the mid-$20's.) While the Pentagon keeps leaking its war plans, no one ever writes about what Saddam's war plans might be. What if Saddam responds by firing Scuds with chemical or biological warheads at Saudi Arabian and Kuwaiti oilfields? The world market could lose not only Iraq's two million barrels a day, but millions more. And what if the war drags on and we have as much trouble finding Saddam as we've had finding Osama? 
Don't kid yourself: If prices skyrocket because of a war in the Persian Gulf, Venezuela, Iran, Nigeria and others will cut back their output and keep prices high to milk the moment for all it's worth.
The scenario that could produce $6-a-barrel oil goes like this: Iraq under Saddam has been pumping up to two million barrels of oil a day, under the U.N. oil-for-food program. Let's say a U.S. invasion works and in short order Saddam is ousted and replaced by an Iraqi Thomas Jefferson, or just a "nice" general ready to abandon Iraq's nuclear weapons program and rejoin the family of nations. 
That would mean Iraq would be able to modernize all its oilfields, attract foreign investment and in short order ramp up its oil production to its long-sought capacity of five million barrels a day. That is at least three million barrels of oil a day more on the world market, and Iraq, which will be desperate for cash to rebuild, is not likely to restrain itself. (Now you understand why Saudi Arabia, Iran and Kuwait all have an economic interest in Saddam's staying in power and Iraq's remaining a pariah state, so it can't produce more oil.) 
In addition, notes Mr. Verleger, if we invade Iraq in the late winter or spring, when world oil demand normally declines, OPEC countries will have to slash their own production even more to accommodate Iraq. This also would be coming at a time when non-OPEC countries (Russia, Mexico, Norway, Oman and Angola) have been steadily boosting their output and will continue doing so. Most OPEC countries, however, can't cut back any more to make room for them. Venezuela is broke. Iran, Nigeria and Saudi Arabia need cash to deal with all their debts, their masses of unemployed and new infrastructure demands. (Watch Saudi Arabia. King Fahd is now gravely ill in a hospital in Switzerland, and the struggle to succeed him is in full swing.)
Bottom line: A quick victory that brings Iraq fully back into the oil market could lead to a sharp fall in oil incomes throughout OPEC that could seriously weaken the oil cartel and rob its many autocratic regimes of the income they need to maintain their closed political systems. In fact, give me sustained $10-a-barrel oil and I'll give you revolutions from Iran to Saudi Arabia, and throw in Venezuela. 
If that scenario prevails, you could look at an invasion of Iraq as a possible two-for-one sale: destroy Saddam and destabilize OPEC at the same time. Buy one, get one free. But you better prepare for the consequences of both.

HEADLINE: Democratic Hopefuls Lift Their Voices and Spirits 

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
For Senator John Edwards, Democrat of North Carolina, it was the disappearance of the budget surplus in President Bush's first 18 months in office, a loss that he described yesterday as more of a threat to the nation's future than the drop in the stock market. 
 For Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, another Democrat who might run for president, it was Mr. Bush's tax cut that he urged Mr. Bush yesterday to scale back in light of the war and the recession. 
 For all the potential presidential candidates who spoke this week in New York, it was a suddenly sunny recollection of the years when Bill Clinton ran the nation.
Barely two months ago, the Democrats who were considering a race for the White House faced what appeared to be the most daunting of tasks, making a case to unseat a wartime president who was as popular as any chief executive in the nation's history. 
But after two days of speeches that ended yesterday, it was clear that a president who had appeared unassailable and unbeatable seems -- at least to those who want to beat him -- to be exposed on many fronts. 
If Mr. Bush had any hopes that his status as a wartime president would shield him from partisan criticism over the next 30 months, that was certainly erased by the time the last Democrat spoke at a meeting of the Democratic Leadership Council, the moderate group of Democrats whose stars include Mr. Clinton.
No one was arguing, even in this most Democratic setting and certainly not this early, that Mr. Bush will be the second member of his family to be a one-term president. Yet, a confluence of events -- the ailing economy, the problems on Wall Street and polls that show many Americans feel that the nation is heading in the wrong direction -- have clearly emboldened Democrats to attack Mr. Bush with a tone and persistence that would have seemed unimaginable even two months ago. 
The speeches suggested a road map the party might follow in trying to defeat Mr. Bush, at least based on the current state of play in the world.
In speech after speech, the Democrats called Mr. Bush's tax cut, a central part of his campaign appeal in 2000, fiscally foolhardy and urged him to roll back at least part of it. (Arguing against a tax cut is, typically, a stand most Democrats avoid.) 
"Figure out a new budget for America," Mr. Gephardt, the House minority leader, said. "This great country cannot afford, and our great working people should not be prisoner, to our president's rigid politics as he leads us back to an unending valley of deficits."
The orators described an economy that was faltering because of Mr. Bush's policies and, in a bit of role-reversal, cast the Democrats as the party of fiscal responsibility.
"Unfortunately, this administration is taking us exactly in the wrong direction," Mr. Edwards said. "The only thing that compares to the losses we've seen in the stock market over the last year is the loss of investment in the future."
The Democrats repeatedly sought to link the abuses on Wall Street to Mr. Bush's administration. In contrast to 2000, when the Democratic presidential candidate avoided mentioning the Democrat who ran the White House in the 90's, Mr. Clinton's record was repeatedly invoked. 
Although most attacks were on the domestic front, one Democrat, Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, criticized Mr. Bush's handling of the war in Afghanistan.
The Democrats in attendance included Senators Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut and Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the majority leader. There was one notable absence, Al Gore, a founding member of the organization, who said he had a scheduling conflict. That statement met skepticism from members of the council, who have criticized Mr. Gore for his campaign in 2000.
For all that, Mr. Bush remains as popular as any modern president, and any escalation in the war on terrorism could result in the nation's rallying around him. What is more, the Democrats have their own problems. Many supported the tax cut that the candidates attacked today, and in attacking Mr. Bush's handling of the war or corporate executives, they invite the White House to once again portray the Democratic Party as running left of the nation.
The Republican national chairman, Marc Racicot, noted that four senators were in New York at a time the Senate has not passed a budget. 
"Such an abdication of responsibility and failure of leadership, especially during a time of war and economic uncertainty," Mr. Racicot said, "cannot help but cause one to question whether it is not the height of insincerity to accuse others of failing to meet the very standard of leadership you claim to embrace."

HEADLINE: Hooray for Hillarywood! 

BYLINE:  By MAUREEN DOWD; E-mail: liberties@nytimes.com

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
Hollywood agents now advise budding screenwriters how to pitch scripts by using a political analogy.
 "You're in the Oval Office," they bark. "You're briefing President Bush. He's got no attention span. He doesn't care about details. Sell him the movie." If you can tell the story vividly and simply enough to appeal to the curiosity-challenged chief executive who likes his memos on one page, the agents figure, you might be able to win over busy, bottom-line-oriented studio executives. 
 It's not even an insult. This was never Bush country. The most the president has ever done for California is dump his six-toed cat, Ernie, at a pal's house here. This was Bill Clinton's Magic Kingdom and A.T.M. 
But after 9/11, in a surge of patriotism and hawkishness, many Democrats decided W. might be well cast as president. Maybe, they told each other, a guy who loves Israel so unequivocally and sees the world in bumper-sticker terms would be better at fighting evil than a president who thinks in complete paragraphs and sees life with all its nuances. If Clinton was a talky Stephen Soderbergh feature, W. was a fast-cut Jerry Bruckheimer trailer.
Besides, Hollywood was exhausted from its long tango with Bill. The "power clutch" between L.A. and D.C., as they call it here, was heady and fun. But the ante kept going up, both emotionally and financially. Bill was more high-maintenance and insatiable than a starlet with a brand new Oscar. His trashy exit, with the last-minute pardons, angered many here. And fund-raising dinners had escalated from $1,000 a plate to $25,000 a plate. Even in a bull market, Bill was a draining co-dependent.
But Mr. Clinton's star power lingers, and the Top Gun aura of W. has faded. Hollywood players who were mocked for having the run of the Clinton White House now acidly point out that at least they only wanted to jump on the Lincoln bed rather than dictate energy policy, as the current favored West Wing guests do.
There have been dinners and coffees for candidates. "John Edwards is practically living here," says one star's political consultant, adding that no one is sure if he's exciting or an empty suit. John Kerry is popular on issues, but people here have been e-mailing around a Washington Post article about his volatile wife, Teresa. Tom Daschle and Dick Gephardt are respected visitors. ("Dick needs eyebrows," sighs a Democrat.) 
Holy Joe Lieberman is unpopular here. "He asked for money and then bashed Hollywood," groused one fund-raiser. Most Clinton-lovers here never warmed up to Al Gore, finding him supercilious. The story circulated that when a wealthy donor hosted a Gore-Lieberman fund-raising party at his mansion, Mr. Gore came up to him at the end, not to thank him but to ask where the bathroom was.
Tinseltown may not recover from its Clinton exhaustion until it's time for another Clinton run. Senator Clinton is on the move. She made a boffo keynote speech Monday at the Democratic Leadership Council meeting in New York, bashing the president's economic record compared with her husbands. The Clintons have asked the government to pay millions in legal fees incurred by the Whitewater investigation; Hillary sees the reimbursement as a vindication. 
She recently got into a rumble with her party's Mr. Clean, the campaign finance reformer Russ Feingold. In Hillary's real world, the soft money that Mr. Feingold wants to see banned forever is what elects and re-elects the Clintons. Like Terry McAuliffe, the party chairman and Clinton bagman, Hillary pays lip service to cleaning up the money-in-politics sewer, but knows her presidential ambitions would be sustained by the big checks Mr. Feingold wants to outlaw from Hollywood and Wall Street. 
Democratic strategists think Bill has smiled on John Edwards's candidacy because he and Hillary want Mr. Edwards to lose to W. in 2004, thus diminishing him and clearing the way for a Hillary run in 2008.
Hollywood prefers actresses under 40, but doesn't mind women over 40 running studios, Senate offices or the country. In the new futuristic Eddie Murphy movie set in the year 2087, Mrs. Clinton was a beloved president long ago. In space, $10,000 bills have her face on them and are known not as dollars, but as Hillaries.

HEADLINE: CORPORATE CONDUCT: THE PRESIDENT; 
Bush Signs Bill Aimed at Fraud In Corporations

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 30 

 BODY:
In a sign of how profoundly the nation's business scandals and volatile stock market have rocked his administration, President Bush signed a sweeping corporate-fraud bill today with central provisions that he opposed just three weeks ago.
 Even though he had objected to the provisions earlier and had promoted his team's corporate experience in his presidential campaign, Mr. Bush cast himself today as the protector of the small investor and the rank-and-file worker. 
 Vowing stiff punishment for corporate wrongdoers, Mr. Bush bluntly threatened, "No more easy money for corporate criminals, just hard time." He called the legislation "the most far-reaching reforms of American business practices since the time of Franklin Delano Roosevelt." 
Mr. Bush spoke on an East Room riser flanked by key members of his economic team and Republican Congressional leaders as well as by smiling Democrats like Senator Tom Daschle, who until recently had criticized the president as sluggish in response to the corporate scandals.
But this morning the White House created a political tableau of a Washington united, with the president positioned at center stage. "The era of low standards and false profits is over," Mr. Bush said. "No boardroom in America is above or beyond the law."
The bill, an extensive overhaul of corporate fraud, securities and accounting laws, creates a regulatory board with investigative and enforcement powers to oversee the accounting industry and punish corrupt auditors. It also establishes new standards for prosecuting wrongdoing and gives corporate whistle-blowers broad new protections. Executives who deliberately defrauded investors would face long prison terms.
The evildoers, the president said, were corporate executives, who were notably scarce in a room lighted for television and crowded with members of the House and the Senate who had jumped on the corporate responsibility bill juggernaut as it raced through Congress this month.
"Free markets are not a jungle in which only the unscrupulous survive, or a financial free-for-all guided only by greed," Mr. Bush said. "For the sake of our free economy, those who break the law -- break the rules of fairness, those who are dishonest, however wealthy or successful they may be -- must pay a price."
With top law enforcers from his administration in the room, including Attorney General John Ashcroft and Harvey L. Pitt, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the president said that "tricking an investor into taking a risk is theft by another name."
Despite the president's verbal pyrotechnics, Democrats were already trying to seize the political upper hand by saying that the new law was a good first step but that it hardly went far enough -- and by pointing out that the White House had been corralled into supporting it.
"They had to be convinced of its merit, but once convinced, they were supporters, and I'm grateful for that," said Mr. Daschle, the Democratic majority leader, who said that he wondered why Mr. Bush's Justice Department had not yet indicted executives of Enron, the corporation whose December 2001 bankruptcy was opening day to the current corporate scandals. As the allegations of corporate wrongdoing mounted in recent weeks, Mr. Daschle was among those who called for Mr. Pitt's resignation.
At the signing ceremony, Mr. Daschle stood behind Mr. Bush and alongside Senator Trent Lott, the Republican minority leader. Next to Mr. Lott stood the bill's two sponsors, Senator Paul S. Sarbanes, Democrat of Maryland, and Representative Michael G. Oxley, Republican of Ohio. But it was Mr. Daschle who got the first handshake from Mr. Bush and the first presidential pen of the four that were used in the bill signing.
The ink was scarcely dry by the time Senator John Edwards, the Democrat from North Carolina who is thinking of running for president, issued a statement later today calling for corporate executives to disclose their pay voluntarily. Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House minority leader who is also considering a run for president, also issued a statement, calling for enactment of a broader set of initiatives and declaring that Congress and the White House had to do more. 
Even Mr. Pitt, who earlier in the year called such a bill largely unnecessary, said it was too soon to tell how much abuse the legislation would actually prevent.
"I think this bill is just really a very important first step in restoring confidence," Mr. Pitt said in the East Room crush after the signing. "Now we have to implement it. We've got our hands full."
Rarely has an issue caught such instant bipartisan fire in Washington. This one was fueled by nearly daily disclosures of corporate fraud, the plummeting stock market and politicians' concerns that voters would hold them responsible.
The terrain was strikingly different as recently as April, when the Republican-controlled House passed a limited bill to curb corporate fraud. A far tougher version in the Democratic-controlled Senate was languishing because of opposition from the accounting industry and prominent Senate Republicans.
But then came the collapse of WorldCom in June, along with renewed attention to the corporate stock dealings of Mr. Bush when he was a director of a Texas oil company. In addition, Halliburton, the Texas energy services company where Vice President Cheney was chairman and chief executive, is under investigation by the S.E.C. for some of its accounting practices.
The Senate bill, sponsored by Mr. Sarbanes, was given new life and passed unanimously on July 15. Though the White House had long expressed concerns about that bill, by then Mr. Bush's advisers were growing increasingly worried about the stock market and declining investor confidence. After declaring that the economy was suffering a "hangover" from an economic binge of the last decade, Mr. Bush strongly hinted that he was inclined to sign almost any bill that emerged from negotiations between the House and the Senate.
Those negotiations were completed last week on the same day that former executives of Adelphia Communications were led away in handcuffs on charges that they had looted the cable company of more than $1 billion -- yet another corporate scandal that helped galvanize support for the tougher legislation.
Today, Mr. Bush called the bill signing "this historic occasion" and praised Mr. Sarbanes and Mr. Oxley as "persistent voices for reform."
Mr. Bush also said that the United States economy was fundamentally sound and that more than 200 federal prosecutors were already at work trying to root out corporate fraud. "Every corporate official who has chosen to commit a crime can expect to face the consequences," he said.

HEADLINE: In Attacks on Bush, Kerry Sets Himself Apart 

BYLINE:  By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 30 

 BODY:
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell was cruising through a Senate hearing on arms control, charming his Democratic adversaries and deftly parrying their questions, when Senator John Kerry, a Democrat from Massachusetts, took the microphone.
 In the aggressive style he honed as a prosecutor two decades ago, Mr. Kerry unleashed a barrage of criticism against President Bush's nuclear arms treaty with Russia, saying it "neutered" previous pacts and included a "huge contradiction." Twice, he interrupted a clearly irritated Mr. Powell in midsentence. 
 For many Democrats, the war on terrorism has made that kind of frontal assault on Bush foreign policy seem risky, if not politically suicidal. But not for Mr. Kerry. A decorated Vietnam veteran and potential presidential candidate, he has lustily attacked the administration on policies like trans-Atlantic relations, Pentagon spending, Middle East negotiations and even Mr. Bush's greatest triumph, Afghanistan. 
"I think there were serious errors," Mr. Kerry said in an interview, referring to the American ground campaign in Afghanistan that he contends probably allowed Osama bin Laden to slip into Pakistan. He made the point again on Monday as he joined other potential presidential candidates in speaking to centrist Democrats in New York.
"In some ways, Al Qaeda is more dangerous today because we didn't take advantage of initiative, which is critical in war," he added.
Mr. Kerry says he has felt compelled to criticize the administration in large part because of his Vietnam experience, first as a gunboat commander and then as an antiwar organizer. "I learned what happens when people in public office fail to ask questions," he said.
But Republican and some Democratic officials say they see another motivation: Mr. Kerry's desire to separate himself from the pack in the Democratic sweepstakes for president. Attacking the president on war-related issues is nearly risk-free for him, those officials say, because his Vietnam experience makes it difficult to impugn his patriotism.
In that sense, Mr. Kerry, 58, shares a bond with Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, who is also a decorated Vietnam veteran and a close friend of Mr. Kerry's. There has been talk of Mr. McCain's joining a Kerry Democratic ticket in 2004, fueled by Mr. Kerry's plans to spend a weekend this fall at Mr. McCain's cabin near Sedona, Ariz. Both men's offices denied the rumors.
Still, the war record of Mr. Kerry has not stopped the Republicans from likening him to the last Democratic presidential nominee from Massachusetts, Michael S. Dukakis.
"I think John Kerry is trying to grab the left wing of the Democratic Party," said Gov. Bill Owens of Colorado, vice chairman of the Republican Governors Association. "His nomination would allow us to correctly position him as another liberal from Massachusetts."
Mr. Kerry's strong words have also caused a stir within the Democratic Party, reflecting tensions over the politics of foreign policy in the post-9/11 world.
On one side of the debate are Democrats, including many in Congress, who contend that the party will win Congressional seats this fall by focusing on domestic issues like Social Security, prescription drugs and corporate ethics. When a plunging stock market and accounting scandals seem to have wounded the Republicans, these Democrats say, it is foolish to fight the president on his strongest ground, foreign affairs.
"We have a treasure trove of domestic issues," said David Axelrod, a strategist from Chicago who is advising a handful of Democratic candidates for Congress and governor. "Why should we muddy the waters by talking about issues that redound to Bush's political benefit?" 
Many Democrats still point to the experience of the Senate majority leader, Tom Daschle, whose patriotism was questioned by Republicans in February after he suggested that the administration articulate clearer goals for the war on terrorism.
But on the other side is a virtual shadow government of former diplomats, Pentagon officials and National Security Council aides from the Clinton administration who are encouraging Democrats like Mr. Kerry, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut and others to challenge Mr. Bush's foreign policies.
These experts, seeking to articulate a worldview rooted in the internationalist traditions of Franklin D. Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy, have accused Mr. Bush of isolationism and of wasting opportunities to reduce tensions in the Mideast. 
"This administration's tendency to act unilaterally weakens us in the world," said Will Marshall, president of the Progressive Policy Institute, a centrist Democratic group, articulating the emerging critique.
Michael O'Hanlon, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said the party's leading candidates for 2004 should speak forcefully on military and foreign policy to avoid repeating what he considers a major error by Al Gore in the 2000 campaign. Mr. Gore did not talk about foreign policy "unless Bush brought it up, because his pollsters told him Americans didn't want to hear about it," Mr. O'Hanlon said, which "helped give credibility to Bush."
Few Democrats have answered that call, led by senators positioning themselves to run for president in 2004. Mr. Lieberman says the administration has not done enough to support Iraqi opposition groups. Senator John Edwards of North Carolina has criticized the administration for not helping expand an international peacekeeping force in Afghanistan.
But Mr. Kerry has been the harshest critic. In an interview addressing a range of issues, he called the Bush Mideast policies "confused," saying Mr. Bush could not expect to achieve peace without maintaining at least low-level contacts with Yasir Arafat. On Iraq, he said Mr. Bush had allowed "his rhetoric to get way ahead of his thinking," talking tough without preparing the country for a potentially bloody conflict. In 1991, Mr. Kerry joined most other Democrats in voting against letting Mr. Bush's father use force to expel Iraqi troops from Kuwait.
He has been most scathing, however, on Afghanistan, arguing that the Pentagon's decision to rely on Afghan troops instead of American soldiers in the battle of Tora Bora in March probably allowed Mr. bin Laden and his lieutenants to escape. 
Asked who should be held accountable for the Tora Bora strategy, Mr. Kerry points to the president. "If you are the skipper of the ship, and the ship runs aground while you are asleep in your stateroom, you are relieved of duty, no excuse," he said.
After graduating from Yale, Mr. Kerry volunteered for the Navy and became commander of a patrol boat. He was awarded Silver and Bronze Stars, but he returned from Vietnam disillusioned. In the early 1970's, he helped organize Vietnam Veterans Against the War and captured national attention by throwing away some of his war ribbons -- but not his medals -- in an antiwar demonstration outside the Capitol.
The Vietnam experience also taught Mr. Kerry the dangers of instigating large military actions without public support, clear goals or a victory strategy, concerns he says he also has about the war on terrorism.
He said he "learned what happens when America pursues a military expedition without the support of the American people" and "what happens to soldiers in the military when you are not determined to win."
In one sign of how central the war experience is to Mr. Kerry's political persona, a model of his gunboat is displayed in the anteroom to his Capitol Hill suite, along with photographs of his crew.
His advisers say that if Mr. Kerry runs for president, he will not hesitate to highlight his war experience. Vietnam will not only give him credibility on military affairs but also insulate him from accusations that he is too liberal on issues like abortion or the environment, they say.
Mr. Kerry, acknowledging that many Democrats are more comfortable with domestic issues than foreign or military affairs, offered a solution: linking the two.
"I think there is no such thing anymore as foreign policy," he said. "It's all Main Street American policy. People are concerned about their economic security and they are concerned about their physical and national security. They are all linked together: interest rates, trade, international boundaries with respect to crime and terror, the movement of disease, the trafficking in people, immigration."
"It's an American policy," he added, "not a Democratic Party policy."

HEADLINE: AIR POWER ALONE CAN'T DEFEAT IRAQ, RUMSFELD ASSERTS 

BYLINE:  By ERIC SCHMITT and JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 30 

 BODY:
Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said today that Iraq now has mobile biological-weapons laboratories that would be very difficult to bomb, an example, he said, of why air power alone would not destroy all of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
 Even if Iraq ultimately agreed to allow international inspectors back into the country, President Saddam Hussein has taken such steps to conceal his weapons program that inspections would be ineffective, Mr. Rumsfeld said at a news conference this afternoon. 
 He added that many of the sites are buried deep underground and that weapons are produced in factories that also make legitimate commercial products. 
His remarks were the most extensive he has offered on the challenges facing the Pentagon in planning to unseat President Hussein and eliminate his arsenal, though he also made it clear that the administration had not settled on a specific plan. 
In recent weeks Mr. Rumsfeld has stepped up his campaign to warn of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, a strategy that some military and other officials say is meant to begin laying the groundwork for a war with Iraq, if President Bush makes that decision.
Under repeated questioning, Mr. Rumsfeld stopped short of saying the administration had little option but to invade Iraq with ground troops. But other military officials said today that short of a coup, that may be the only sure way to topple Mr. Hussein and eliminate Iraq's weapons. In fact, within the Pentagon, senior officers are engaged in active debate over whether ground troops should be used -- and if so, how many, and how they would be deployed.
Senate hearings on Iraq begin on Wednesday, with experts on Iraq from outside the administration to testify before the Foreign Relations Committee.
One witness, Gen. Joseph Hoar, a retired head of the Central Command, expressed wariness about using military force to oust Mr. Hussein before all diplomatic and economic avenues were exhausted. "It can be done," General Hoar said in a telephone interview tonight. "But the risk is, how many lives will be lost?"
A growing number of lawmakers from both parties are voicing concern that the administration is heading precipitously toward war. Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Delaware Democrat who is chairman of the committee, told reporters today that administration officials had assured him that they would not begin an attack this fall and were still considering a range of options.
But each of those options has drawbacks. Mr. Rumsfeld and his deputy, Paul D. Wolfowitz, have repeatedly scorned the idea of pressing for the resumption of the international inspections, which Mr. Hussein barred in 1998. 
Senator Biden, however, said resuming the inspections could slow Baghdad's weapons production and build international support for additional measures against Iraq.
Many intelligence analysts say it is unlikely that a coup would succeed, noting that at least six attempts failed in the 1990's.
The current policy of containing Iraq has many supporters in the military and the State Department. But other senior administration officials argue that even with the constraints, it is only a matter of time before Mr. Hussein develops the weapons and the means to launch them -- or provides them to terrorist groups.
Various strategies remain under consideration. One is an attack on Baghdad and other command centers in an effort to cause a quick collapse of the government; another is an all-out air and land war, involving as many as 250,000 troops.
Asked today about the choices, Mr. Rumsfeld said, "We don't talk about specific plans."
Several Mideast allies have warned the administration against an attack. King Abdullah II of Jordan is to meet with Mr. Bush on Thursday, probably to voice concern about hawkish officials pressing for action. 
In Baghdad today, Mr. Hussein dismissed as a "tall story" assertions by American and British leaders that Iraq was again well on the way to developing weapons of mass destruction.
But in the past few weeks, Mr. Rumsfeld has been briefing lawmakers, NATO allies and former defense secretaries on the threat posed by countries, including Iraq, that the United States believes have biological, chemical or nuclear capacities. In the briefings, participants said, Mr. Rumsfeld explained how state-sponsored weapons programs are proceeding menacingly, while terrorist groups are becoming more sophisticated in their efforts to obtain such weapons.
In the briefings, Mr. Rumsfeld has not taken the next step -- to say the United States and its allies should use military force to eliminate this threat. But some participants said that was the impression he left. 
And while, in the briefings, Mr. Rumsfeld mentions other countries of concern, including North Korea and Syria, in his public comments he has singled out Iraq.
"They have chemical weapons and biological weapons, and they have an appetite for nuclear weapons and have been working on them for a good many years, and there's an awful lot we don't know about their programs," he said today.
He also explained why he believed weapons inspections would be ineffective, saying, "It would take such a thoroughly intrusive inspection regime, agreed to and then lived up to by Iraq, that it's difficult to comprehend -- even begin to think -- that they might accept such a regime." 
Mr. Rumsfeld's remarks built on comments he made on Monday during a brief news conference at the United States Joint Forces Command in Suffolk, Va., where he was asked why the United States did not just bomb Iraq's weapons sites.
"The idea that it's easy to simply go do what you suggested ought to be done from the air, the implication being from the air, is a misunderstanding of the situation," Mr. Rumsfeld said. "The Iraqis have a great deal of what they do deeply buried." 
Mr. Rumsfeld added today, "They move around a lot of things to avoid detection or if not detection, at least to avoid having them attacked."

HEADLINE: Powell Meets With North Korea Counterpart in Brunei 

BYLINE:  By TODD S. PURDUM with DON KIRK 

DATELINE: BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN, Brunei, Wednesday, July 31 

 BODY:
In the United States's highest-level contact with North Korea since President Bush took office, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell met informally for 15 minutes here this morning with Pyongyang's foreign minister, and officials said Secretary Powell would consider further talks.
 In the last week, North Korea has made surprising overtures toward South Korea, Japan and the United States, and officials had hinted broadly that Secretary Powell might meet with his North Korean counterpart on the sidelines of the Association of South East Asians Nations here. Dialogue between Washington and North Korea, which Mr. Bush listed as part of an "axis of evil" with Iraq and Iran, had virtually ceased for the last 18 months. 
 On Tuesday, South Korea agreed to open talks with the North this coming weekend, in the first move toward cabinet-level negotiations that South Korean officials hope will finally lead to resumption of the tortuous process of reconciliation. Those talks would be to develop an agenda for full-scale negotiations to begin around Aug. 15, the 57th anniversary of the end of Japanese rule over the Korean peninsula.
Secretary Powell's brief meeting with North Korea's foreign minister, Paek Nam Sun, was far less ambitious, and the secretary appeared to go out of his way to choreograph a semi-spontaneous session that was deliberately low-key. Asked about a meeting with the Americans as he entered a breakfast early this morning, Mr. Paek told reporters, "I'm always ready."
Two hours later, when the secretary arrived in the delegates' lounge of the Asean Regional Forum, aides said he sent word to the North Koreans that he would be available, and Mr. Paek came in for what the State Department spokesman described as "a 15-minute informal chat."
The spokesman, Richard A. Boucher, said Secretary Powell "reaffirmed the president's policy and said that in any future discussions, we would want to emphasize a variety of matters including proliferation, mutual commitment made under the agreed framework, and conventional forces." He said any future meeting or travel to North Korea would be considered in light of statements the North Koreans made.
In 1994, the Clinton administration and North Korea worked out an "agreed framework," in which Pyongyang agreed to freeze its plutonium production program and eventually to dismantle it. In return, the United States agreed to replace North Korea's graphite-moderated reactors with two light-water reactors, which are less useful in making bomb-grade material.
In the final year of his presidency, Mr. Clinton sought in vain to negotiate a broader accord that would end North Korea's production of medium- and long-range missiles, as well as the export of missile technology. But after a policy review last year, the Bush administration decided to seek a more comprehensive program to limit North Korea's overall military potential, with simultaneous concessions on nuclear issues and conventional arms, plus agreements for extensive verification.
A key to the opening this week toward Washington, Seoul and Tokyo was North Korea's sudden expression of regret last week over a naval skirmish with the South on June 29. Five South Korean sailors were killed and 19 were injured when a North Korean vessel fired on their patrol boat, which later sank. South Korean defense officials believe that 13 North Koreans also died when South Korean ships opened fire on them, in an exchange for which each country initially blamed the other.

HEADLINE: CORPORATE CONDUCT: TELECOMMUNICATIONS; 
Telecommunications: Lament but Little Repair

BYLINE:  By STEPHEN LABATON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 30 

 BODY:
The government's confusion over how to respond to the growing crisis in the telecommunications industry burst into the open today, as Democrats, Republicans and a regulator offered competing and often contradictory prescriptions for fixing the industry's problems.
 As President Bush signed a corporate fraud and accounting measure that had moved through Congress with unusual swiftness and bipartisanship, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, Michael K. Powell, received a chilly lecture from senators on the Commerce Committee -- some of whom urged him to step up deregulation while others asked him to impose greater oversight. 
 The hearing illustrated that while Washington has responded to the outrage of burned investors and spurned employees, the matter of overhauling the nation's muddled telecommunications policies has yet to find a political consensus. When Mr. Powell suggested, for instance, that Congress consider easing the restrictions on allowing regional telephone companies to enter the high-speed Internet market, he met with criticism from the committee's chairman, Senator Ernest F. Hollings, Democrat of South Carolina, though another Democrat, Senator John B. Breaux of Louisiana, supported the idea. 
A growing number of telecommunications companies have reported financial trouble. Three of the largest -- the cable service provider Adelphia Communications, Global Crossing and WorldCom -- have recently filed for bankruptcy protection. And on Sunday, Qwest Communications International said it had exaggerated revenue and understated costs over the last three years and would be restating its financial results for those years after an internal investigation.
In the discussion today over how Washington should respond, Mr. Powell gingerly tried to steer a middle course. Preoccupied with ensuring that bankruptcies and accounting problems do not cause disruptions for telephone and Internet users, he proposed a modest set of recommendations that mixed some new regulatory oversight with some loosening of the existing rules.
"Clearly, the telecommunications industry is riding on extremely stormy seas," he said at a hearing that featured testimony from newly installed executives of WorldCom, Qwest and Global Crossing. "However, this market is not collapsing and is not going to fail over time."
Mr. Powell attributed the problems of the industry to "the Internet gold rush."
"The Telecommunications Act of 1996 and the commercialization and mass-market adoption of the Internet," he said, "led to a near-hysterical belief that the opportunities for growth were limitless. Very few did not get swept up in the hot air."
The frenzied market, unrealistic expectations and flawed business models, he said, have now caused a series of "devastating" consequences for telecommunications. They include mountains of debt, accounting scandals, inefficient industry structures, low investor confidence, and capital markets that have all but shut down.
He said consumers did not need to fear disruptions caused by the problems at WorldCom and Qwest, but he also proposed that Congress give the F.C.C. clearer and broader authority to block ailing companies from imposing such disruptions.
He asked for a sharp increase in the maximum penalties for companies that violate the anticompetitive provisions of the 1996 act. (The regional Bells have each paid hundreds of millions of dollars in fines in the last year, even if a small percentage of their revenue.) 
But he also said that the industry needs "prudent consolidation" that ought to be approved by regulators, and suggested that Congress should reduce regulation over the high-speed Internet market for the regional Bell operating companies.
"Broadband very likely holds the key for the long-term recovery of the telecommunications industry and for our nation's long-term economic growth and its ability to compete on the global stage," he said, without endorsing any of the proposals that have stalled in the Senate. "I urge Congress to craft and implement legislation that produces the right regulatory environment for the provision of broadband services."
That suggestion prompted a gentle rebuke from several Democratic senators, notably Mr. Hollings, a longtime critic of the Bell companies, which dominate their markets. He suggested that rather than deregulating the phone companies, Congress might consider reregulating their rivals in the cable industry.
He said that the regional Bell companies were interested only in extending their local monopolies into long-distance and high-speed Internet service, and that they had flexed formidable lobbying and legal muscle as part of that effort.
"They've got every gimmick and trick in the book to continue their monopoly, take you over and take me over," Mr. Hollings said to Mr. Powell. "Don't let them do that."
"I'm not so easily rolled over," Mr. Powell replied.
Another committee Democrat, Senator Byron L. Dorgan of North Dakota, said he gets "heartburn" every time he hears Mr. Powell discuss his faith in the marketplace and imply that there is less of a need for regulatory oversight.
But Mr. Powell held his ground.
"I make no apologies for my strong belief in the marketplace," he said, "but that has been widely misperceived in the trade press as not believing that regulations don't have a place. I'm not a libertarian, or I would not have taken this job."
He said most important policy decisions ought to be made by Congress, not regulators, and the choice between regulation and deregulation was a false one, adding: "It's not regulation versus deregulation. We need to do both. We need to do both well."
After Mr. Powell's testimony, senior executives from WorldCom, Qwest and Global Crossing assured the committee that there would be no disruptions to phone customers from their financial problems. 
The executives -- John W. Sidgmore of WorldCom, John J. Legere of Global Crossing and Afshin Mohebbi of Qwest -- faced hostile questions from senators, who urged them to pursue former top executives who had reaped hundreds of millions of dollars from corporate loans or from exercising stock options.
"Aren't stock options supposed to be based on performance?" asked Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, who joined other senators in urging the executives to take steps to recoup some of the huge compensation packages awarded to former executives, including Bernard J. Ebbers of WorldCom, Joseph P. Nacchio of Qwest and Gary Winnick of Global Crossing. The current executives said their companies had started investigations and they would seek any money that might have been provided illegally.
Mr. Ebbers, Mr. Nacchio and Mr. Winnick declined invitations to appear before the committee.

HEADLINE: THE AD CAMPAIGN; 
Early Shots by Two Democrats Challenging Pataki; Andrew M. Cuomo

BYLINE:  By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD 

 BODY:
 Andrew M. Cuomo, the former federal housing secretary and a Democratic candidate for governor, started broadcasting a 30-second advertisement last weekend on New York City stations, which Cuomo aides say reach 70 to 75 percent of likely primary voters. A series of commercials had appeared upstate in recent weeks, focusing on the economy.

PRODUCER -- Squier, Knapp & Dunn

ON THE SCREEN -- The advertisement opens with a shot of a car mechanic named Joe Drennan, then shows Geraldine A. Ferraro, the former congresswoman, speaking about Mr. Cuomo's record on homelessness. Those scenes are interspersed with text saying, "At 28, Andrew Cuomo created a nonprofit to help the homeless. 75,000 helped over 15 years" and pictures of Mr. Cuomo at a construction site and shaking hands with a diverse group of adults and children. Edward M. Kennedy, the Massachusetts senator who is the uncle of Mr. Cuomo's wife, Kerry, speaks of Mr. Cuomo's ability to solve problems. Text flashes, "At 39, appointed to President Clinton's cabinet. Turned around a $30 billion agency. Passed major reform legislation though Congress." A succession of images show Mr. Cuomo with former President Bill Clinton. As Martin Luther King III, son of the civil rights leader, talks about Mr. Cuomo's record on civil rights, text says, "Increased minority home ownership to record levels. Created 300,000 jobs." Adam Clayton Powell IV, who was raised in Puerto Rico and is the son of the Harlem congressman, says Mr. Cuomo can solve problems, as text reads, "Rebuilt cities after disasters." There is a shot of Mr. Cuomo helping to lift the wood frame of a wall. The advertisement closes with pictures of Mr. King, Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Drennan summing up Mr. Cuomo's abilities.

THE SCRIPT -- Mr. Drennan: "I met Andrew 20 years ago working in a Queens gas station."

Ms. Ferraro: "He built housing for the homeless. He brought in drug rehab, job training, poured his heart into giving homeless kids a chance in life."

Mr. Kennedy: "You've got big problems in New York City and big problems in New York. What they need is somebody who knows how to get things done. Andrew Cuomo knows how to get things done."

Mr. King: "He took on the K.K.K. to fight discrimination. Fought church and synagogue burnings."

Mr. Powell: "Instead of talking about problems, Andrew solves them."

Mr. King: "How would I describe Andrew? A fighter."

Mr. Kennedy: "A leader."

Mr. Drennan: "Pretty good mechanic."

ACCURACY -- Mr. Cuomo's opponent, H. Carl McCall, the state comptroller, says figures such as "created 300,000 jobs" are exaggerations. Mr. Cuomo's camp said the figure comes from a 1999 White House paper on the Clinton administration's community development programs. Mr. McCall's campaign also takes issue with the phrase, "Turned around a $30 billion agency." They cite reports by Susan Gaffney, the housing and urban development inspector general, who found accounting irregularities and management problems. Mr. Cuomo's camp countered that a January 2001 report by Ms. Gaffney praised Mr. Cuomo for taking steps to address the problems and improve an agency whose troubles they say predated his term.

SCORECARD -- Mr. Cuomo seeks to attract black, Hispanic and female voters while presenting himself as a leader in league with Democratic heavyweights. He obviously believes that his turn as a Clinton cabinet secretary will appeal to voters, though neither Bill nor Hillary Rodham Clinton have endorsed anyone. To keep all this fraternizing with political celebrities from turning off voters who see him as aloof, he brings in some humanizing, "just-a-regular-guy" levity with Mr. Drennan's testament to his ability under a hood. The overall message to viewers is, this guy is comfortable in a limo with the Kennedys, but he can fix it, too. RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD
