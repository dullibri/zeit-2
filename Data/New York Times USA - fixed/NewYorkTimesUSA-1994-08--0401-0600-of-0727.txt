FLEET FINANCE SETTLES GEORGIA LENDING LAWSUIT

BYLINE: AP 

 BODY:
Fleet Finance Inc., which was accused in several lawsuits in Georgia of luring poor people into high interest second-mortgage loans, settled the final large pending case yesterday for $5.9 million. The proposed settlement, which would mark the end of a fierce three-year battle, was filed in Cobb County Superior Court and could receive final approval in 60 days. Fleet Finance admitted no wrongdoing. 
 Fleet Finance, a subsidiary of the Fleet Financial Group, was accused of charging excessive loan rates and using abusive collection practices. The case was scheduled to be tried in February, but a delay was granted while settlement talks proceeded. In the settlement, all 7,000 plaintiffs will receive letters clearing their credit records of any problems related to their dealings with Fleet Finance. About 3,000 people will split the cash settlement. Fleet Finance agreed last year to provide $115 million in loans to settle two other suits and a state lending discrimination investigation.

HEADLINE: Two Votes for Quality Health Care

 BODY:
The Senate is poised to vote on two health-care items that will bear heavily on the quality of American medicine and on medical institutions in the New York City area. Both items are in the health-care bill introduced by the majority leader, George Mitchell, and are expected to be the subject of early votes.
One item is a wholly justifiable tax on health insurance premiums that Mr. Mitchell proposes to pay for training doctors and conducting medical research. Republicans, in a blind anti-tax fervor, want to block this tax as well. But that would greatly damage the research and training programs that have made American medicine the finest and most innovative in the world. 
 Mr. Mitchell's premium tax is needed because much of the money that is currently spent to train doctors and pay for research -- $16 billion -- is to disappear. The money is taken out of fees that hospitals charge Medicare and private patients. But Congress is about to drastically reduce Medicare reimbursements to pay for health reform, and private patients are increasingly signing up with managed-care plans that are unwilling to subsidize high-quality medical training. Under Mr. Mitchell's bill, patients would pay a tax that would generate about $13 billion a year by 2001 (adjusted for inflation) for training and education -- less than they pay now.
The second item up for an early vote is a provision in the Mitchell bill that would have Washington decide not only how many residents hospitals will train each year but also whether those training slots should be assigned to generalists or specialists. The provision would undercut a process that should be decided by the marketplace; Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, will rightly propose to strike it out.
Congress has no idea what specialists will be needed two years from today, let alone in a decade or more. One researcher, for example, has estimated that if every health plan patterned itself after an H.M.O. in Denver, the nation could stop training urologists for almost 20 years before a shortage occurred.
With science and treatment practices radically changing, it makes no sense for Congress to presume it knows best. The best route to reform is for health plans to hire the specialists they need and for medical students to gravitate where job opportunities are opening up.
Admittedly, New York City -- which trains 15 percent of the nation's residents -- would be disproportionately harmed if Congress votes the wrong way on these two issues. But other major health centers would be diminished as well. Innovative research and highly skilled doctors benefit all Americans.

HEADLINE: U.S. Plays Game With Cuban Immigrants

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The report of Cubans hijacking a ferry to come to the United States, and possibly sparking a new Mariel boat lift, highlights the hypocrisy of United States immigration policy toward Cuba (news article, Aug. 7). Under President Reagan, the United States agreed to take as many as 20,000 Cuban immigrants a year, but in reality only a few thousand visas are granted annually. 
 On the other hand, unlike United States policy toward other Caribbean or Latin neighbors (as the sad saga of Haitian refugees illustrates), all Cubans who make their way to the United States are allowed to stay. This means that instead of getting a visa at the United States interest section in Havana and boarding a plane to Miami in a safe, dignified fashion, Cubans who want to come here must risk their lives or risk the lives of others by hijacking a boat or plane.
If they reach Florida shores, they are hailed as heroes. If they die at sea, they are mourned as casualties of Fidel Castro's cruel dictatorship.
Cuba has maintained that would-be United States immigrants can only leave the country if they have been granted a United States visa, and that those trying to leave illegally would be stopped. Whenever the Cubans stop illegal emigrants, however, Washington delights in shouting: "See, people are so desperate to leave that they will risk their lives on rafts. And what does Castro do? He won't even let them leave!"
And what happens when Fidel Castro threatens to stop doing the dirty work for the United States and let everyone leave who wants to? He is a devil who wants to wage an immigration war against the United States.
Yet according to Treasury Department regulations, Americans who travel to Cuba, unless they are journalists, professional researchers or Cuban-Americans visiting relatives, are threatened with 10-year jail sentences and fines of $250,000.
A group called the Freedom to Travel Campaign has had its bank account frozen since June for organizing an educational trip to Cuba.
We should grant Cubans the 20,000 visas a year the agreement we signed permits, and allow United States citizens the right to travel to Cuba.
Indeed, why not lift the whole embargo? Helping improve Cuba's economy and insuring a peaceful post-Castro transition is our best immigration policy.

HEADLINE: Foster Care's Ills Include Runaway Children

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Languishing in Foster Care" (editorial, Aug. 2) omits what may be the most telling symptom of the ills that plague the foster care system: the prevalence of recurrent runaway behavior among foster children. 
 A recent survey by the National Association of Social Workers showed that 20 percent of the children living in homeless shelters across the country had arrived there directly from foster care. Other studies, including one in New York City, have determined that as much as half the runaway population has spent time in foster care or in a group home.
The overrepresentation of foster children among the thousands of children who run away suggests not just the susceptibility of foster children to such behavior, but also the inability of agencies to provide stability and permanence to many children.
To be young, homeless and poor almost always entails a sense of desperation that can reach far into the future. The incidence of survival sex among runaways, for example, accounts for the high prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus infection among that populace.
Many others are ensnared by chronic welfare dependency, unemployment and family conflict. That so many foster children are drawn to this dead-end existence bespeaks the quality of life that young people endure in state care.

HEADLINE: A City's Dreams Go to Market

BYLINE: By MOLLY O'NEILL 

 BODY:
BARRY BENEPE has been arranging blue-tipped pins on a giant topographical map in his West 16th Street office this summer. Mr. Benepe, the director of Greenmarket, a project of the New York City Council on the Environment that operates 20 open-air food emporiums where farmers sell directly to consumers, explained that each pin indicates a farm from which a vegetable grower, a cider maker, a fisherman or a dairy or poultry farmer drives to the city's Greenmarkets. To Mr. Benepe, who helped found the project in 1976, the pins represent 200 family farms that have been saved by the money they make at the city's markets.
And when he runs his finger from the blue pin near the Finger Lakes in upstate New York south to Manhattan, or from the cluster of blue pins in New Jersey north to the Bronx, he is tracing a web that connects urban life with rural life, a web that continues to change and grow -- and that continues to amaze Mr. Benepe. 
 The more that Greenmarkets become fixtures in city neighborhoods, the more they resemble the proverbial backyard fence where neighbors meet to exchange recipes and gossip and concerns about their streets. The markets are meeting places for children's play groups, dissemination points for public-education and community organizations, platforms for local politicians and stages for concertina players and performance artists. The markets mirror the local quotidian. They sell fresh food, but they promote community.
Nearly a quarter of the city's Greenmarkets are in public parks and squares that had previously fallen into disuse, like Union Square in Manhattan and Joyce Kilmer Park in the Bronx. Ironically, it took the lure of consumerism to draw people back to these public spaces, said William H. Whyte, an urban planner and the author of "City: Rediscovering the Center" (Doubleday, 1989), a study of American cities that focuses on public spaces. "This particular form of commerce has restored the kind of intimate, personal exchange that the city has lost over the years," he said.
By importing slices of the country, the city realized something it had lost.
"I hadn't been to Joyce Kilmer Park in a good 10 years; it had gotten bad," said Elmira Johnston, as she bought sweet corn recently at the Bronx Sunday Market at the Grand Concourse and East 162d Street. "My daughter and I bring the grandchildren every Sunday, shop, make a picnic, talk to folks we haven't seen in years."
There was little doubt when the Greenmarket program was established that selling retail could help save small farms. Even though farmers pay a nominal fee to rent their spaces and have to travel far and hire extra workers to sell retail, the economics of direct marketing are in their favor.
"Selling to wholesalers, a farmer's share of the produce dollar is about 21 cents," said Robert A. Lewis, who founded the program with Mr. Benepe and is now the chief marketing representative for the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets. "Selling direct, his share is 100 percent."
The team also suspected that Greenmarkets could transform city blocks. But neither of them imagined the number or variety of groups that would begin using the concept to create discrete town squares in the city. Mr. Lewis said that besides the 20 markets sponsored by the council, there are five farmers' markets organized by community groups in the city and several others being planned.
From a pastoral point of view, a Greenmarket's aroma of basil, mint and peaches, as well as its kaleidoscope of flowers and produce, transforms city corners, emanating what one shopper at La Marqueta, an open-air market in East Harlem, recently described as "ripples of hope." In some neighborhoods, the sensory onslaught kindles an interest in flavor and novelty, freshness and variety. In others, the ripples of hope extend far beyond dinner.
Increasingly, farmers' markets are being used to create what Chineda Lewis called "a center of wholesome family life." Ms. Lewis, a member of People United for Local Leadership, a community association in Far Rockaway, Queens, worked with two tenant organizations to create a Saturday market, not only to bring fresh produce to the 14,000 families who live in the six nearby housing projects, but also "to create a place where our young can learn about entrepreneurship."
"They help clean the market, set up the market and are planning to market products of their own," she said.
With hopes of creating a town square in the midst of housing projects, as well as providing residents with high-quality produce, the Mid-Bronx Desperadoes, a community housing coalition, organized a weekly farmers' market. So rare is fresh, unpackaged food in some parts of the borough that the Bronx Perinatal Consortium, a program dedicated to improving maternal and infant health, began two farmers' markets in the Mott Haven section, as part of the federally funded Healthy Start Program.
Across the country, community groups, ecology-awareness associations, private developers and city governments are raising the flag for urban farmers' markets. According to the 1994 National Farmers' Directory, published by the United States Department of Agriculture, 1,755 such markets have opened in the last decade. There were less than 100 20 years ago. Many, like the Pike Place Market in Seattle, grew from the ashes of longstanding markets and brought new life to downtrodden areas. Others, like the farmers' market in Ann Arbor, Mich., were created in tenuous areas and became beacons for neighborhood renewal.
The Union Square Greenmarket in Manhattan is an honored parable in the world of direct farm marketing. Even Mr. Benepe, who organized the market, continues to be amazed when he sees real estate advertisements that boast "Views of Union Square."
Only the naive, though, claim that the market alone transformed the dross of Union Square into gold.
"There were many other forces," Mr. Benepe said. "An active neighborhood association and business association, and an increasing number of residents who held the market and various other quality-of-life issues in common." He added that, in his 18-year tenure, he has opened as many markets that have failed as have succeeded.
Nevertheless, before the Greenmarket opened in 1977, Union Square was so drug-infested that students from Xavier High School on 16th Street could be expelled for stepping foot in the place, he said. Now, packed with farm stands four days a week, the square is the heart -- or perhaps the soul -- of a vibrant, food-centric neighborhood.
Since the Union Square Greenmarket made its debut, the average retail rents on lower Fifth Avenue have jumped from $20 a square foot to $75, said Joseph Gardiner, the president of 100 Fifth Avenue Company, a real estate firm in the area. Discount department stores have been supplanted by businesses like Emporio Armani, Paragon Sports and ABC Carpet and Home, and about a dozen former coffee shops have been turned into stylish restaurants.
The Union Square Market, Mr. Benepe said, grosses $9 million a year, half of the $18 million generated by the 20 Greenmarkets in the city. Union Square is to farmers what Broadway is to actors.
But while the 20,000 people who brouse among the 80 stands at Union Square each week are as varied as the produce sold there, most other markets are not places where the haves meet the have-nots. They are places where people of similar incomes and ethnic backgrounds meet. In Greenmarkets in stylish neighborhoods, conversations tend to be about the exquisiteness of a particular farmer's tomatoes. In beleaguered areas, where the markets are tiny and often the sole patch of green amid acres of concrete and asphalt, people talk about who has the best price on tomatoes.
For growers like John Schmid of Goshen, N.Y., Union Square is small potatoes; the Bronx Sunday Market is big potatoes. Total market revenues are beside the point. He knows that red-skinned potatoes smaller than gum balls will draw lines of eager customers at Union Square and will languish at the market along the Grand Concourse.
"People at Union Square buy food they can talk about," Mr. Schmid said. "In the Bronx, people buy food they can eat."
For market organizers like Hilary Baum, big potatoes anchor the web that connects the city with the country, and neighbors with one another. Ms. Baum, who helped found Public Market Partners, a consulting firm in the Bronx that has organized 16 markets nationally, now manages the La Marqueta open-air market, an emporium outside the venerable but partly shuttered market in East Harlem.
People go to markets for the food and for the clean, well-patrolled open space, she said. They stay for the art activities for children, the cooking demonstrations and the nutrition and public health information that are offered at the markets she manages.
As he watched the neighborhood cluster around the four vendors at 115th Street and Park Avenue, Paolo Hernandez, a retired cabdriver, said the scene "reminds me of the old days when La Marqueta was a big deal."
"It gives me a good, warm feeling to see people coming back out on the street again," he said.
Exactly, Ms. Baum said. She surveyed the half-block patch of asphalt that is one of her own particular fields of dreams and -- above the creak of shopping carts, calls for "Corn here!" and the caw of birds -- she said, "If you organize a market well, people come."

HEADLINE: THE HEALTH CARE DEBATE: The House;
House Action on Health Measure May Wait Till After Labor Day

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 17

 BODY:
House Democratic leaders today acknowledged that they had no clear idea when they could begin work on health care legislation, but said it might be after Labor Day, a prospect that dismayed many advocates of a health care overhaul.
Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the majority leader, told members in a closed Democratic caucus today that the Congressional Budget Office had yet to complete its analyses of the House's health care bills, and that the House could therefore not begin to act on them. 
 Mr. Gephardt told members that if, as expected, the budget office was still not finished when the House completes its work on the crime bill this week, they might be sent home, according to participants in the caucus.
With this newest delay on the horizon, some advocates of a health care overhaul said they worried that the mood and the momentum for a comprehensive bill were waning in the House as the clock winds down to the elections in November. "I've said repeatedly the one thing the leadership doesn't have to give away is time," said Representative Pete Stark of California, chairman of the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health. "Members go home for two weeks, it gives people a lot of time to complain."
The majority leader maintained that there was still the possibility of moving faster on health care legislation if the budget office reports back in the next two weeks. But he was clearly exasperated when reporters asked when the debate might begin. "The answer to the question of 'when' has been, is and for some time will be, 'I don't know,' " he said. "I can say that 40 or 50 ways, but that's the answer. I don't know, and I know of no one who knows."
Participants at the caucus said Mr. Gephardt told them to stay flexible because they might be called back before Labor Day. The House will not officially adjourn, which is widely seen as an effort to keep pressure on the Senate and the budget office to continue working on the legislation.
But Mr. Gephardt acknowledged in the caucus that the House might not take up the bill until after Labor Day, participants said, adding that if that occurred, members would stay in session through the weekend of Sept. 9 to try to complete action before Yom Kippur begins on Sept. 14.
In an interview tonight, the majority leader said it was impossible to get a hard prediction from the budget office on when it would be finished. The analysis, he said, "is an interactive process," with the authors of the various bills under scrutiny given the opportunity to make changes and have those changes analyzed in turn. The budget office is analyzing several plans, including the leadership's proposal, a Republican alternative and a new measure from a group of bipartisan moderates.
The latest delays in the House heightened the anxiety of members committed to passing major health legislation this year, even as they shared the leadership's frustration with the budget office.
"Delay is something that does not work to our advantage," said Representative Benjamin L. Cardin, Democrat of Maryland and a leadership ally on health. Representative Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, said, "It's going to push the calendar very hard."
 
'Perception of Disarray'
 Representative Pat Williams, a Montana Democrat who is active in health issues, said that while the actual "legislative days" lost were insignificant, the "helter-skelter nature of the scheduling is harmful, because of the perception of disarray."
Republicans have scoffed that the real reason for the delay is that Democrats do not have the votes for their plan. But Democrats insist that they cannot even begin to count heads and make their case until the budget office evaluates the financial impact of competing plans, expected to be at the heart of the debate.
There are several broad political concerns: All along, Democratic strategists have worried that sending members home for the August recess before voting on a bill would expose them to further lobbying and feed their jitters at a critical time. Moreover, some Republicans have mounted a campaign to argue that there is no reason to "rush through" health legislation.
According to the polls, their arguments are finding an increasingly receptive audience, with many Americans now saying it makes sense to slow down and "do it right," thus easing the pressure to act.
Finally, some Democratic strategists say, there is the unknown impact of the Senate's action, which could be largely complete by the time the House gets down to work. This could help with the Democratic effort in the House, if the Senate upholds some form of requirement that employers help pay for their workers' insurance if coverage goals go unmet.
 
Gloom Among Backers
 But some strategists in the House say it could make the effort to pass the far more sweeping Gephardt bill more difficult, if the Senate waters down the plan proposed by Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the majority leader.
There was a distinct gloom today among some of the members most involved in the health care debate.
Representative Jim McDermott, Democrat of Washington and a leader of the liberal wing of the Democratic caucus on health issues, said, "I sat and answered my own phones for a while last night, and people were saying they don't want the Gephardt bill, they don't want the Mitchell bill, and by the way they don't want crime either. So the opposition is pretty well organized."
He added, "Each day makes it less and less likely that we'll have real reform." And Representative Jim Cooper of Tennessee, an advocate of the bipartisan plan, said, "The clock is a very tough adversary." He said it was his impression that it would take "a couple of weeks" for the budget office to finish work on the plans.
John Rother, legislative director for the American Association of Retired Persons, which has endorsed the Democratic leadership's bills in both houses, said, "Our polling still shows strong public support for each of the key elements of the Gephardt legislation. But Congress has been hearing mostly from those who want exceptions, exemptions and delay for financial reasons."
Mr. Rother added, "The fate of the bill in the House probably rests with how vocal the majority that supports the bill is during the next two weeks."

Chart: "DIARY: Health Care Developments"
 
YESTERDAY
 As Senators continued their speeches on health care, a coalition of moderates worked on a counterproposal to the bill introduced by the majority leader, George J. Mitchell of Maine. In the House, however, Democratic leaders said delays in the Congressional Budget Office's analysis of rival plans could delay debate for weeks.
 
CONGRESS
 Senate Mr. Mitchell took the Senate floor to say he was tired of hearing Republicans inaccurately describe his bill as a Government takeover of health care. He said his proposal would actually give Americans more choices than they have today. The moderate group, calling itself the "mainstream coalition," may propose its alternative plan to Mr. Mitchell and Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader. "We've got to scale back the proposal in order to get something passed," said one of the group, Senator Bob Kerrey, Democrat of Nebraska.
House The majority leader, Richard Gephardt of Missouri, said uncertainty over when the Congressional Budget Office would complete its work meant that debate would start no later than Sept. 8.
 
WHITE HOUSE
White House officials said legislation that did not include universal coverage could actually result in higher insurance costs. The White House economic adviser, Laura D'Andrea Tyson, said, for example, that Senator Dole's proposal could end up costing families $200 more a year in insurance premiums.

HEADLINE: Chinese Accused of Pirating Disks

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SUZHOU, China

 BODY:
There is no telephone listing for the Suzhou Polydisk Factory, and visitors to the modern factory sheathed in blue reflecting glass and rose-colored marble are met at the gate by an unsmiling guard who asks them to leave. Now.
"No photographs," the guard says angrily, standing not far from a large billboard quoting China's paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping: "Science and Technology Are the Number One Productive Force." 
 There is good reason for the hostile reception. According to investigators working for American recording companies, the Suzhou factory's owners are among the biggest pirates of compact disks in Asia. The factory is believed to have pressed hundreds of thousands of pirated disks last year at a cost to the American recording industry and its artists of millions of dollars in lost royalties.
Over all, the United States estimates that Chinese piracy of American intellectual property has cost its companies and performing artists about $1 billion a year.
Consequently, little more than two months after President Clinton renewed special trading privileges for China, the Clinton Administration is threatening to impose sanctions on China unless it closes the nation's 26 compact disk factories and curbs other rampant piracy of videotapes, audio tapes, computer software and books.
In June, the Administration formally designated China a priority target under a clause of the American trade law that gives the Chinese six months to resolve the piracy issue or face sanctions equal to the damage done to the American economy.
After meeting with her Chinese counterparts last month, the deputy United States trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky, said in Beijing that while China had "world class" laws to protect intellectual property rights, they were too rarely enforced.
The Chinese Government does not deny that piracy occurs, but its officials say the United States is acting rashly by threatening trade sanctions so soon after China tightened its copyright laws. Last month, the Chinese Government announced new penalties for copyright infringement, including criminal punishments.
"We need more time," said Gao Linghan, deputy director of the National Copyright Administration of China. "Give us five years to end this problem. If we can solve these problems in five years, then I think we will have done a good job."
As for the compact disk factories, Mr. Gao said: "I do not know that all of the 26 factories are producing pirated compact disks. We've asked the Americans to give us evidence, but so far they have not."
But industry specialists say that pirated compact disks are flooding out of China by the tens of millions each year, most headed to the black markets of Southeast Asia.
 
Sound Quality Is High
 While the dubbing on cassette tapes bootlegged in Asia can sound sloppy, the quality of China's pirated compact disks approaches that of legitimate disks, because digital technology makes possible nearly perfect reproduction. And the price is far lower. In Beijing, pirated disks of best-selling albums sell in street markets for about $2, and for not much more when exported to other capitals of Southeast Asia.
"In China, there are very few CD plants that are not involved in blatant piracy," said J. C. Giouw, regional director of the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry. He said Chinese Government investigators did not close the factory in this city, about 75 miles west of Shanghai, even after they discovered that it was pirating works by everyone from Whitney Houston to Kenny G to several Hong Kong pop stars who sing in Cantonese.
Mr. Giouw said the federation had filed suit in China against a Taiwan businessman, Shih Hua Luk, who was accused of making compact disks at the plant in Suzhou and another plant in nearby Hangzhou.
 
Damages Are Sought
 The suit, which seeks about $2 million in damages, contends that Mr. Shih was involved last year in the production of at least 139,000 pirated compact disks at the two Chinese plants, with most of them intended for export to distributors as far away as Argentina.
Mr. Shih was reported to have returned home to Taiwan from the Chinese mainland earlier this year. His lawyer in Shanghai said Mr. Shih denied any wrongdoing. The Suzhou factory's owners did not respond to requests for an interview.
Ms. Barshefsky, the American trade official, noted that China's compact disk factories had a production capacity of about 75 million disks a year, and added that virtually every one of the disks produced in China was pirated. "These factories must be shut down," she said.
 
Family Connections Used
 Industry officials say that most compact disk factories in China are joint ventures with investors from Hong Kong or Taiwan, who cleverly sought partners among the relatives of officials of the Chinese Communist Party. These connections, they said, may explain why there has been so little copyright enforcement until now.
"Because of the Chinese factories, we think we've lost $25 million in Hong Kong alone," said Paul Ewing, vice president and regional director of Warner Music International in Hong Kong. The British crown colony is the destination of millions of Chinese-made pirated disks each year.
Mr. Ewing said the Chinese factories were able to make pirated disks within days of the release of almost any major recording. Only a few weeks after the spring release of a new hit single by Prince, "The Most Beautiful Girl in the World," the song began turning up in Chinese-made pirated compact disks smuggled across the border into Hong Kong.
"They're pirating people like Prince, Phil Collins, Madonna," Mr. Ewing said.
 
Tough for American Companies
 Neil Turkewitz, senior vice president of the Recording Industry Association of America, said that American recording companies had found it "very hard to do business in China" because of Chinese media laws that restrict the distribution of cassette tapes, compact disks or any other form of recording.
As a result, he said, the major recording companies have never reached agreement for their works to be produced in China. Yet the recordings are being reproduced illegally by the tens of millions, with the Chinese Government continuing to assist plant owners by granting import concessions for the machinery needed to make compact disks.
"There are used CD plants that you can acquire for less than $1 million, and because the equipment is viewed as high-tech, the Chinese give inducements for the investment," Mr. Turkewitz said.
The Chinese Government has made at least token efforts to enforce the new intellectual property laws.
 
Software Distributor Raided
 In June, the authorities raided a computer software distributor and four retail shops in Beijing and seized hundreds of computer disks bearing pirated software. Last month, a new intellectual property court in China agreed to hear complaints from three American companies -- Microsoft, Lotus Development and Autodesk -- that their software was being pirated by Chinese retailers.
But those moves came nowhere close to satisfying American industry. "Things are happening much too slowly," said Diane Smiroldo, a spokeswoman in Washington for the Business Software Alliance, which represents most major American companies in the industry.
"We have found targets and brought them to the attention of the Chinese," she said, "and the cases have sort of languished."
The Software Alliance estimates that nearly 95 percent of all the software used in China is pirated and that the resulting losses to American companies totaled more than $300 million last year.
The American recording industry put its losses in China at nearly $345 million last year from pirated compact disks.

HEADLINE: Florida Nearing Emergency As Cuban Exodus Increases

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MIAMI, Aug. 17

 BODY:
Nearly 500 Cuban refugees were picked up off the Florida coast today, nudging state officials closer to declaring an immigration emergency that would include the mobilization of the National Guard and state workers to shelter, medically screen and transport large groups of people to relocation centers.
The Coast Guard said late tonight that 537 Cubans had arrived in Florida today, compared with 339 on Tuesday, 282 on Monday and 170 on Sunday. The daily numbers have steadily risen since the beginning of the year and are now the highest since the 1980 Mariel boatlift, which brought 125,200 Cubans to the United States in five months. 
 More than 6,400 Cuban refugees, mostly small groups on makeshift crafts, have made it to the United States since January, compared with 3,656 for all of 1993. Among those passing through the Transit Home for Cuban Refugees on Stock Island today was a 91-year-old woman who left Cuba with 16 others in a raft three days earlier.
A senior State Department official today attributed the exodus to a policy shift by President Fidel Castro of Cuba.
 
Policy Change on Rafters
 "The reason this increase is happening is Castro has changed his policy on rafters," the official said. "He's still stopping big boats, but not rafters. He's stopping boats that are assets of value to Cuba. But he's not stopping people from leaving in rafts. This is a policy decision he took a week and a half ago."
But the official said the current influx was not Mariel II or a slow-motion Mariel.
"The principal characteristic of Mariel was a bunch of people took boats from Florida and picked up people in Cuba," the official said. "There is no sign at all of that happening."
Rafael Dausa, director of political affairs at the Cuban Interest Section in Washington, denied that there had been a change in policy by Havana but warned that unless the United States took measures to stop the refugee flow itself, "we will be in the position of not putting any obstacles" to the departures.
Among the measures he wants the United States to take, Mr. Dausa said, are lifting the economic embargo on Cuba and stopping radio broadcasts from Miami to Cuba.
Both Federal and state officials said on Tuesday that they could still manage without putting into action emergency plans that include blocking vessels and mobilizing thousands of National Guard and state law-enforcement officers to transport large numbers of refugees to processing centers.
 
Governor Prods White House
 Gov. Lawton Chiles called for "an expanded presence" of the Border Patrol and the Immigration and Naturalization Service in South Florida and a "comprehensive test" of the Federal plan to deal with a possible major influx.
Tonight, at a news conference in Key West, the Governor said the situation was "critically approachinhg an emergency," and added: "I'm insisting that the Federal Government prepare to invoke its emergency plan."
Mr. Chiles also said that he had been in touch with the White House and that he might make his request official on Thursday.
Ana Cobian, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department, said that more personnel from both agencies had already been deployed, and that it was adequate for the current needs. She declined to describe the extent of the increase in personnel.
State officials were poised to activate an emergency plan that would dispatch thousands of National Guardsmen and law-enforcement officers to pick up Cuban refugees and take them to temporary reception centers, and then to Homestead Air Force Base south of here for relocation out of state. The plan is meant to support a Federal response for the first 72 hours of the emergency.
 
'No Magic Number' Needed
 But the officials said there was no particular number of refugees to be reached before putting the plan into effect.
"There's no magic number; it varies from county to county," said Eric Tolbert, bureau chief of the Division of Emergency Management in the Florida Department of Community Affairs.
In Dade County, where most Cuban refugees have historically settled, officials were more worried about long-term effects. On Tuesday they asked Attorney General Janet Reno for emergency immigration money for housing, health care and public safety from a $35 million Federal fund that is expected to increase soon to $75 million.
State officials, who have also asked for Federal aid, put the cost to Florida at $1 billion.
As they arrive in increasing numbers, the refugees say they risked dehydration and sharks to escape repression and misery in Cuba. Many said they were prompted to flee by a Government crackdown on the black market, which they say they had relied on for food.
Today the Coast Guard brought in a body on a raft found off Miami. Lieut. Comdr. Jim Howe, a Coast Guard spokesman in Miami, said a pleasure boat spotted the raft that was carrying one dead man and a male companion who survived the trip but was later hospitalized.
 
Scrambling for Supplies
 Refugees said today that despite the risks, many in Cuba were scrambling for supplies to make the 90-mile trip across the Florida Straits to Key West.
A group of 28 Cubans from Villa Clara province said each person in the group of four families and a few friends played a role in making a 22-foot boat in three weeks: one man stole aluminum irrigation pipes from the sugar cane field where he worked to fashion the boat's hull, another bought or traded gathered spare parts and rebuilt the boat's engine from a 1956 Ford.
Most refugees stay with relatives, said workers with the United States Catholic Conference, which helps resettle them. Those who are alone are put into motels until they get their working papers in order. Most are relocated out of state to job markets that offer work in hotels, restaurants and construction.
Today some of the new arrivals who had been moved into motels in Miami spent the time contacting out-of-state relatives by telephone, watching television or simply sitting out near the street.

HEADLINE: Lawyer Says Rifkin's Brain Shows a Defect

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: RIVERHEAD, L.I., Aug. 17

 BODY:
The lawyer for the confessed serial killer Joel Rifkin said today that preliminary neurological testing indicated Mr. Rifkin suffered from a brain dysfunction that might have contributed to his killing spree.
The lawyer, Martin Efman, made his comments on the final day of hearings in Suffolk County, where Mr. Rifkin is charged with killing two women. 
 The hearings were to determine whether a confession that Mr. Rifkin made would be admissible at his coming trial.
Mr. Rifkin, 34, of East Meadow, has admitted killing 17 women, many of them prostitutes, and then dumping their bodies throughout the New York area.
He was convicted in Nassau County of killing one woman and was sentenced to 25 years to life in prison.
 
Testing Is Requested
 During Wednesday's hearing, Mr. Efman asked Judge John Jones of Suffolk County to authorize further testing for Mr. Rifkin, saying, "We want to be able to locate the source of the abnormality."
The judge's authorization was required because Mr. Efman is a court-appointed lawyer and bills in the case are paid by the state.
The defense argues that Mr. Rifkin should not be held criminally responsible for the killings because he suffered from a mental disease or defect.
Mr. Efman said the neurological disorder was one of several factors contributing to the defect.
The defense also plans to contend that Mr. Rifkin, 34, an unemployed landscaper from East Meadow, suffered from adoptive child syndrome. Mr. Rifkin's adoption as an infant caused him such trauma that he became mentally defective, according to the defense.
Mr. Rifkin took the stand today and testified that he asked for a lawyer "at least 20 times" while making a statement to police.
Police detectives testified that that was untrue.
He was charged with killing Leah Evens and Lauren Marquez, both 24, of Manhattan, whose bodies were found in wooded areas of Riverhead.
Judge Jones said he would rule on both the confession and further neurological testing on Aug. 26.

HEADLINE: Seoul Drawing Fire for Crackdowns

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Aug. 17

 BODY:
Kim Young Don, a 23-year-old senior at Sogang University, spent last weekend at a "pan-national" rally with thousands of other students, calling for reunification of the Korean peninsula and the expulsion of American troops from South Korea.
The police tried to break up the rally and clashed with studentsarmed with sticks and stones. About 200 people were injured. Finally the police dispersed the crowd by pouring tear-gas fluid on them from helicopters. 
 "We do not think of the Government as a democratic government," Mr. Kim said on Tuesday, the day after the rally ended. "If it was a real democratic Government, people could come out with different views."
The student, a mass communications major, said the police were looking for him because he recently wrote an article praising the late North Korean leader, Kim Il Sung. Such an act is considered illegal in South Korea.
There is not a lot of sympathy in South Korea for Mr. Kim's views on Kim Il Sung. But some critics are beginning to question whether South Korea should be coming down so hard on students for expressing their opinions.
 
Prospects Look Brighter
 The crackdowns, which have intensified since the North Korean President's death last month, come when prospects are growing for an improvement in relations between the two Koreas. One sign was the agreement reached last weekend between the United States and the North Korean Government in Pyongyang on North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons program.
On the same day the demonstrators were doused by helicopter for espousing reunification, South Korea's President, Kim Young Sam, proclaimed in a speech that "the Korean people cannot live divided forever." He offered aid to North Korea if it would change its ways.
The South has triumphed in the economic contest with the Communist North. But instead of basking it its victory, some critics say, the South remains locked in a cold-war rivalry that compels it to act like a police state, harming its reputation abroad.
The United States Government has called upon South Korea to change its national security law, which bans any unauthorized contact with North Korea and any show of support for the Communist nation.
But the South Korean Government maintains that the students and other dissidents are being directed by North Korea to destabilize the South and often initiate violence. On Monday, radicals in Kwangju, a city in the southwest, bombed a police station.
 
1,300 Taken Into Custody
 "Acts such as the outright support of the North Korean policies and the use of such murderous weapons as iron pipes, which were wielded against the police -- these acts severely disturb our law and order and are an affront to the state's power," Choi Hyong Woo, the Home Affairs Minister, said at a news conference on Tuesday. "These acts will be sternly dealt with from the standpoint of protecting free democracy."
The police have taken more than 1,300 of the weekend demonstrators into custody.
"It's not proper for the South Korean Government to take an attitude that is so contradictory to the international megatrend," said Lee Boo Young, a National Assembly member from the opposition Democratic Party who was once a student demonstrator.
Mr. Lee, who was scorned for suggesting that South Korea send condolences after the death of Kim Il Sung, said the suppression of dissident views only generated sympathy for a student movement that was "very trivial and small." The chairman of the Democratic Party, Lee Ki Taek, has called the crackdowns a "McCarthyite witch hunt."
South Korea has a decades-long tradition of violent protests by students, and the spraying of tear gas is almost a political rite of passage. "Many of the good officials in our Government have been demonstrators," said Koo Bon Tae, assistant minister of the National Unification Board, which deals with North Korean issues. As a college student in the 1960's, Mr. Koo protested the normalization of relations with Japan, Korea's former colonial ruler.
 
Movement Loses Some Vigor
 The protests have helped bring about democratic changes in South Korea. By all accounts, since the election a year and a half ago of Kim Young Sam, the first civilian President in more than three decades, the student movement has lost some of its reason for being and its vigor.
Some say it is surprising that President Kim, who was himself a dissident fighting the military dictatorships that once ruled South Korea, should be so harsh on the students. Some analysts here say it is simply politics. Conservatives who revile North Korea and Kim Il Sung form the base of support for President Kim's Democratic Liberal Party.
The student demonstrations are organized by student councils on each campus that are in turn coordinated by the Federation of Korean Student Councils.
Fear about the students rose last month when the Rev. Park Hong, a Jesuit priest and the president of Sogang University, said he had evidence that the student protesters were being fed instructions from North Korea. More recently he said in a newspaper interview that "jusapa," or followers of Kim Il Sung's ideology of self-reliance, had also infiltrated religious organizations, newspapers and political parties.
Newspaper editorials and Government officials are now demanding that Father Park provide proof of his statements. For his part, the university president is lying low, and he declined a request for an interview.
 
180 Students Join Protest
 On Tuesday, the student council office at Sogang was a pigsty of empty soft drink cans and food cartons, buckets of paint and crumpled banners left over from the pan-national rally, which took place from Saturday through Monday, coinciding with a national holiday commemorating Korea's liberation from Japanese colonial rule.
Mr. Kim, the 23-year-old protester, said he was one of 180 students from Sogang who attended the rally, which was held at Seoul National University. On other occasions, he said, such protests have been able to draw up to 800 of Sogang's 7,000 students.
Mr. Kim, who has a friendly smile and easy manner, said he joined the student movement to fight for democracy, reunification and the expulsion of American troops, who symbolize "the colonial relationship between America and South Korea."
Asked how he could call for greater democracy in South Korea yet not criticize far greater restrictions on rights in North Korea, Mr. Kim said that while North Koreans could not speak freely, "if you look at it from a Korean point of view it does have its own style of democracy."
"In Western theory," he continued, "the more you suppress, the more people revolt. But North Korea has sustained their society for decades" without revolt. "Why have they been able to do it? They have their own type of democracy."

HEADLINE: Pataki Charges Cuomo Put Mansion Budget to Own Use

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK 

 BODY:
In a campaign dog-and-pony show -- minus the pony but starring the dog -- the Republican gubernatorial candidate, George E. Pataki, yesterday used an array of props and the less-than-original vehicle of a Lettermanesque Top 10 list to charge that Gov. Mario M. Cuomo has misused taxpayer money to enhance his life style.
Atop Mr. Pataki's list of "Mario's most wasteful spending" was the use of the Executive Mansion budget last year to pay for flea collars and housebreaking "wee-wee pads" for Mr. Cuomo's dogs, Cara and Max. To illustrate that expenditure, Mr. Pataki summoned his own dog, Jefferson, into the news conference at his Manhattan headquarters. Jefferson, who is named for the third President, a Democrat, dutifully sat and barked for a milk bone at his master's command. 
 The event and the Cuomo campaign's response were typical of what New York's gubernatorial campaign has become in the political doldrums before Labor Day.
Although Mr. Pataki, a State Senator from Putnam County, faces a Sept. 13 primary against Richard M. Rosenbaum, he and Mr. Cuomo and their surrogates have spent the last month exchanging a volley of charges, countercharges, news releases and lawsuits about personal finances and campaign practices. While each candidate has worked to sully the other's integrity, they have devoted far less attention to issues like crime and the economy, which polls show are the primary concerns of the voters.
 
Christmas Tree an Issue
 At one point yesterday, Mr. Pataki took Mr. Cuomo to task because Executive Mansion officials spent $105.80 last year for mail-order Christmas trees. "With millions of trees growing in the Adirondacks, with our Christmas trees good enough to be in the White House, year after year Mario Cuomo sends to an exclusive mail-order catalogue for out-of-state Christmas trees," he said indignantly.
Cuomo officials fired back that the artificial trees were a one-time purchase and that the mansion's primary tree is bought each year from a New York grower. Joel R. Benenson, Mr. Cuomo's campaign press secretary, then characterized Mr. Pataki's charge as "another example of George Pataki saying things that simply aren't true."
Mr. Pataki said his main message yesterday was that Mr. Cuomo's government has wasted money at a time when the state budget was growing faster than inflation and when "we're seeing taxes drive jobs and opportunity out of this state."
Mr. Benenson responded by saying, "If George Pataki truly has the taxpayer's interest at heart, what he should do is release his Top 10 list of personal-tax loopholes that show he paid no Federal income tax in a year when he made a $400,000 killing in a real-estate deal."
 
Examining Mansion Budget
 That was a reference to last week's disclosure in Mr. Pataki's tax returns, which he allowed reporters to review on Friday, that he and his wife paid no Federal income taxes in 1986. They made a profit of $401,666 that year on the sale of a piece of land, but their accountant said they were allowed to defer paying capital-gains taxes on the profit because they immediately bought a more expensive investment property. Payment of the tax is deferred until the investment property is sold, the accountant said.
Mr. Pataki gleaned the examples in his Top 10 list from news reports published over the last five years about spending at the Executive Mansion and about the Governor's use of state aircraft for uses other than state business. He said he thought he could halve spending at the mansion, except for security. He pledged that he and his family would use state aircraft for state business only.
Among the items on Mr. Pataki's list was the use of the mansion's budget to buy a $19,000 stereo system and to pay for subscriptions to fashion magazines. The mansion budget was $462,700 when Mr. Cuomo took office in 1983, rose to a peak of $772,000 in 1989 and is now $484,000.
After Newsday revealed some of the expenditures last month, Mr. Cuomo said that a few of the items, including the dog-care products, were inappropriate purchases that had fallen through the cracks. He said he would reimburse the state $25 to pay for them. Mr. Cuomo and his aides also emphasize that the Governor returns $30,000 of his $130,000 salary to the state each year.
Mr. Cuomo and members of his family periodically use the state airplane and helicopters to take personal trips that do not involve state business. His aides contend that it is appropriate for Mr. Cuomo to use the plane for personal trips because, in Mr. Benenson's words, "he is Governor 24 hours a day."

HEADLINE: Arms Plants Provide Civilians' Power

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TOMSK, Russia

 BODY:
What could be wrong with the agreement last June between Vice President Al Gore and Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin of Russia to close the two reactors here that keep making bomb-grade plutonium? After all, most people think there is already too much plutonium and no place to put it.
"Tomsk would be frozen," is the answer from Nikolai A. Vyatkin, general director of Tomskenergo, the electric utility here in this provincial capital in Siberia, about 2,500 miles east of Moscow. 
 The Soviet Union integrated its bomb manufacturing with its civilian economy so thoroughly that the city of Tomsk is connected to these reactors by an umbilical cord, four steel pipes, each 4 feet in diameter, that carry steam from the reactor 19 miles through the birch and cedar woods. The heat, produced as the reactors create bomb fuel, keeps apartment buildings and factories in this city of 500,000 from freezing through the nine-month winter.
The reactor is in a nearby settlement called Tomsk-7, which is still a closed military zone. The city depends on the reactor for about a quarter of the heat used in the district heating system.
Russia has agreed to close the plant by 2000 and the United States has agreed to help look for financing, but a close look at developments here suggests that the deadline is not likely to be met.
A conventional power plant, the first of five that local officials say will be needed and will cost $740 million, has been under construction at the edge of town for the last six years -- so long that its brick facade is already crumbling in places, and the dandelions and ragweed have covered up some of the construction debris.
The plant would burn oil, gas or coal, whichever is available, to make electricity and steam. It is already hooked into the gas and steam pipes, and the tracks are in place to bring in brown coal from Krasnoyarsk, also in Siberia.
But in June, 1,200 workers from a construction enterprise in Tomsk 7, unpaid for three months, went home. The Russian federal government promised 70 billion rubles for the project but has paid only 16 billion.
The United States Trade and Development Agency promised a grant of up to $1 million to write a feasibility study for this plant and four others; the study could be used to apply for financing from the World Bank or other sources.
But under current circumstances no one would loan the money, because the utility charges only a pittance for its services and collects even less. One kilowatt-hour of electricity sells for one-third of a cent, a thirtieth of its cost in the United States, and the steam to heat a three-room apartment costs about 65 cents a month. Even that is evidently too high for the customers; Tomskenergo says it is owed 80 billion rubles, or $40 million, by factories, hospitals, colleges, schools and others.
 
An Economy in Crisis
 No one is anxious to charge more because, despite rapid inflation, salaries here remain low and the economy is in desperate straits.
Tomskenergo itself is in something of a time warp. Engineers there have a detailed plan for replacing the reactor's steam -- illustrated with a chart hand-drawn in colored pencil.
There are many other ways Tomsk could keep warm. The natural gas that comes out of the oil fields a few hundred miles northwest of here is routinely burned as waste, because the local price is 10 to 15 rubles a cubic meter, about one-sixth the international price, said Mr. Vyatkin. The gas could be turned into electricity that was sent here over existing electric lines, according to local officials. But that, too, takes money.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Measuring the pain of the deadlock on health care reform.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
WITH Democrats badly split over health care reform and Republicans caught up in the role of spoilers, the prospect for health care legislation this year is dimming. Does it matter?
It certainly does to President Clinton, who can ill afford another legislative bruise in a town that shows no mercy to lamed politicians. 
 The tougher question is whether deadlock on health care reform would change other Americans' lives for the worse. And while the answer obviously depends on what sort of reforms are really at stake -- the politics are so fluid that just about anything could emerge from Congress if and when it is galvanized to act -- much also turns on the way one expects the system would evolve without Washington's help.
Martin Feldstein, an economist at Harvard and former adviser to President Reagan, is relatively sanguine. "This is not a magic moment," he argues. "If legislation doesn't pass in the next four weeks, it doesn't mean legislation won't pass in the next four years."
More to the point, though, he is not particularly worried that the alleged problems of the system are destined to fester. The fact that most new jobs lack medical insurance does not prove that a crisis is looming, he says.
"The big growth in the labor force has been second earners," he argues, "who don't need the coverage and would rather take home higher wages."
Then there is the issue of cost containment, which was the original focus of the Clinton task force. "A lot of the market-based reforms are already happening," Mr. Feldstein notes.
Insurers and big employers, he points out, are using their bargaining power to ratchet down the prices charged by physicians and drug companies. And programs that reimburse providers per illness rather than per service have "put a lot of pressure" on costs. "I'm pleasantly surprised by the hospitals' lack of success in gaming the system," he reports.
What's more, Mr. Feldstein is not ready to lose sleep over the uninsured. No one, he notes, can be turned away at the emergency room door for lack of a Blue Cross card.
And while Mr. Feldstein acknowledges the shortcomings of a rag-tag system that spends too much on acute care for the poor and too little on preventive care, he does not see universal coverage as a moral imperative.
Henry Aaron, an economist at the Brookings Institution, could hardly disagree more. For one thing, he worries that the window for reform is closing rapidly and may not reopen in the foreseeable future.
The midterm election will probably add Republicans to the Senate, he notes, deepening the conservative-liberal split on health care with the House and making a nonpartisan compromise far less likely.
Mr. Aaron agrees that President Clinton would be in a position to make another push for reform if he is re-elected in 1996. But he wonders whether the President would "have the stomach for reviving what was a futile effort."
None of this would matter, of course, if health care-as-usual were adequate -- and destined to remain so.
But Mr. Aaron does not share Professor Feldstein's sanguinity. He acknowledges that cost pressures have abated somewhat in the last few years, but doubts that the pause reflects any enduring capacity of the system to repair itself.
Mr. Aaron points out that when health care inflation is plotted over the last quarter century, there are dips comparable to the current one, but no discernible trend toward a lower rate.
And he does not expect a favorable trend to emerge: "Science has not lost its cunning" to generate expensive medical technology, he insists; nor have medical providers lost their incentives to overuse it.
Uwe Reinhardt, an economist at Princeton's Woodrow Wilson School, adds an ominous note to the debate about whether incipient market forces are indeed taming cost inflation.
Most of the savings, he argues, have actually been driven by employers and insurers who have become more vigilant in preventing physicians and hospitals from passing along costs not covered by Medicaid or by walk-in patients lacking the means to pay.
"A lot of this fat will be squeezed out," he predicts. And as a result, the pressures to skimp on the quality of care for the poor will grow, he argues, and "the unwritten catastrophic insurance" now provided to the formally uninsured "may not get financed."
Perhaps the most distressing aspect of this disagreement about the potential consequences of inaction is the context: After more than a year of maneuvering and speculation about health care reform, the real issues are only now being debated.
That may be the way of modern American democracy, and it may yet work out for the best. But then again, maybe it will not. Too much, Mr. Aaron argues, could turn on whether "we have the guts to begin the process of change."

HEADLINE: THE HEALTH CARE DEBATE;
Excerpts From the Senate Debate on the Mitchell Health Care Legislation

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from statements made yesterday on the Senate floor in the eighth day of debate over the health care bill, as transcribed by The New York Times from a broadcast on C-Span:
 
 
 
STATEMENT
BY SENATOR GRASSLEY
 To contrast the Mitchell bill to the status quo alternative:
Today any insurance company can, first of all, deny you coverage. Secondly, impose a pre-existing-condition exclusion so they can say, Well, look, if you have that pre-existing condition, we can exclude you for that existing condition. Limit your lifetime benefits so that your protection runs out when you need it the most. They can cancel it and cancel your coverage when you get sick.
We've had several examples in the very recent weeks of employers for good companies that had their health care canceled for all of their employees because of the incidence of illness among just a few of their employees and just effectively canceled out within a two- or three-month period.
There's also the exclusion of any service from coverage, even a service that might turn out to be most important to you if someone in your family becomes seriously ill.
And no American is guaranteed choice.
And I think these following points are worthwhile to keep in mind:
If your employer doesn't offer a plan you like, you can be out of luck. And 84 percent of employers offer only one plan. Of the employers that make available health insurance to their employees, they provide one plan. Effectively, out of luck if you wanted an alternative choice. You take it or leave it.
Secondly, if your employer doesn't offer a plan that allows you to keep your family doctor, you're also out of luck. . . .
And the Dole plan is better than the status quo alternative, but it's still I don't believe good enough. The insurance companies can still impose pre-existing-condition limitations, they can sell you a policy that doesn't cover the service you may need the most . . . because policies aren't required to provide comprehensive coverage.
 
 
STATEMENT
BY SENATOR SMITH
 My office has received thousands of phone calls and letters, more phone calls and letters, I think, than anything since I've been in the Congress, on the issue of health care reform. Both sides.
I hosted a statewide health care conference earlier this year, in April, that featured leading policy experts from every facet of the health care delivery system. There were doctors, and there were providers and nurses and patients and everyone who had in some way had an impact, or were impacted by any change in legislation in the health care industry. . . .
In addition to that, I have 10 counties in my state and I have held a town meeting in each of those counties. . . . We were there to directly hear from constituents regarding the issue of health care reform. And they spoke out. There were hundreds of them, in all of those town meetings, more than any ever attended any of my citizen forums on any issue. . . .
In short, I guess the fairest thing to say is I've heard New Hampshire speak to me, with me, on this issue. And overwhelmingly what they're saying is that they don't want the Government any more involved in health care than it is already involved now. In other words, less Government involvement.
I think there's a concern, unfortunately, that comes through as I listen to these constituents and providers, and all of those who are in any way affected by this pending legislation. There's a concern that the Government is going to do something to me on this issue.
I think that's coming through loud and clear, and it's a very valid concern: Rather than helping us, they're going to do something to me that may cost me my good quality health care.
And the polls, the national polls, which have changed dramatically from overwhelming support to what President Clinton had proposed to the opposite now, . . . show that Americans share the same feelings as those people in New Hampshire. So I don't think there's a great difference between the states, no matter what state you represent on this issue.
I believe that based on what I have heard, people that I've talked with, that most Americans would oppose not only the underlying finance bill, which is technically on the floor, but also the Clinton-Mitchell-Gephardt, or Clinton-Mitchell bill, as we have here. Fifty-three percent, according to the polls, worry that Congress will pass a plan that gives the Federal Government too much control. And that's a very valid concern. They're suspicious because Government has proven again and again that it's not efficient, it's not compassionate, it's not thrifty and therefore shouldn't be trying to provide for the health care needs of people, least of all health care.
If a mistake is made by a Government official in, perhaps, the administration of the I.R.S., or some other program -- post office, perhaps, late delivering the mail -- it's a problem, maybe, but it's a minor problem compared to some slip-up in the treatment of your health.
 
 
STATEMENT
BY SENATOR HATFIELD
 What we're trying to do in Oregon is to provide everybody with standard, primary health care. We're not going to separate every Siamese twin born in Oregon; we're not going to guarantee, in essence, that everybody has the right to any medical procedure -- over 9,000 of them under Medicare alone. We have prioritized them.
People say, Oh, that's rationing health care. Well, we're rationing health care, yes, but we're doing that today under an economic face which is certainly discriminatory, far more discriminatory than saying to a person 80 years old, If you have a life expectancy added to your life by one year, are we going to engage in a very costly medical procedure as against covering 100 women with prenatal care? No. We can't afford to do it.
Now that gets down to where the real rubber hits the road in terms of having to make the tough decisions that somehow we're going to offer anyone any medical procedure or access to any medical procedure. That's the implication, because we've not addressed those thousands of medical procedures and we . . . have the attitude that any one of them -- and it's very, very clear -- any one of them would be open for anyone.
What Oregon has done is it focuses on the provision of preventive health care services and assesses an access to primary health care before serious health problems develop. Now, it looks at the effectiveness of treatment, it draws lines, as I say, to exclude payment of services that are not effective nor add to the individual's quality of life.
I think we have to face this reality in the national picture as well.
 
 
STATEMENT
BY SENATOR MITCHELL
 I hope the American people will not be fooled by the rhetoric they're hearing here today. And I hope the American people will also think about the irony of these Republican senators getting up here day after day after day and denouncing Government health insurance and Government health care as bad for their constituents even as they benefit from it themselves as individuals and their families.
Every member of this Senate participates in the Government-run health insurance system that's available to all Federal employees. And the Government pays 72 percent of the cost of that health insurance for these Republican senators who are standing here telling their constituents that it's bad for the constituents even as they participate in it for themselves and their families.
You American taxpayers are paying through the Government, 72 percent of the cost of health insurance in a Government-organized health insurance system for the very Republican senators who are now telling you that you shouldn't want Government-run health insurance.
And you are entitled to ask yourselves if it is so bad for you, why is it so good for them and their families.
Has one of them stood up and said, "My constituents, Government health insurance is bad for you, and to prove how much I believe that statement, I'm going to voluntarily drop out of the Government insurance system. And I'm going to put my family in the same place where your family is."
Have you heard one say that yet? No. And you're not likely to.
Now that's just the insurance. Now let's talk about direct care.
If one of these Republican senators doesn't feel well, if he gets a headache, or his stomach aches, he walks a few feet down the Capitol and he goes to the office of the Capitol physician, a Government employee. He is greeted by a clerk who is a Government employee, checked by a nurse who is a Government employee and then goes in to see the doctor, who is a Government employee.
If Government health care is so bad, why do these Republican senators insist on having it for themselves? And then if they get sick, if the doctor says, You've got to go to the hospital, they go to the Bethesda Naval Hospital, or the Walter Reed Army Hospital, Government hospitals. Well, my gosh, ask yourselves, Mr. and Mrs. America, If these Government facilities are so bad, why do these Republican senators want to go there themselves?
And it's not just senators. President Reagan and President Bush were in their capacities as President the most powerful men in the world. And they were independently wealthy, and they could have gone anywhere in the world when they got sick.
And where did they go? Why they went to these Government hospitals. And who can forget the photographs taken of them waving out the window to the public and the press in those Government hospitals?
Why, are you telling us that it's good enough for Presidents, but it's not good enough for ordinary Americans?
 
 
STATEMENT
BY SENATOR BRADLEY
 The Senate's effort to reform the American system of health care has important consequences for all Americans. It will determine the availability and the extent of health care for each of us. It will determine in part how long our parents will live and how healthy our children will be.
As we debate this issue, let's remember what brought us here in the first place. We are not debating this issue by chance. There's a reason why we all speak of this effort as health care reform. In dozens of living rooms and conference halls, in emergency rooms of hospitals and on street corners, the message that I hear from the people of New Jersey is that we need reform.
Our current system is not working as it should; those who have health coverage are paying too much for it, and those without health coverage deserve it. . . .
What people want most is some control of escalating health care costs. What people fear the most is losing their health care if they change jobs or get laid off or lose a job because of a corporate bankruptcy.
What perplexes them as well, when they're confronted with all these escalating costs of health care, is the power of the insurance industry. Want coverage for your heart problem? The insurance company says no because it's a pre-existing condition. In other words, the insurance company will insure you for everything but the heart condition that is most likely to generate the health costs for your family.
In confronting skyrocketing health care costs, small business is left to the mercy of insurance companies. Small businesses have no leverage to negotiate with insurance companies. Too often they're presented with a take-it or leave-it choice that only offers exorbitant costs for health care coverage.
Each of us can enumerate countless occasions in our states when we've had interactions with small-business people who've simply said they can't afford to cover the workers in their particular small business, they can't afford to cover because they were told by the insurance company that it's $6,000 or $7,000 a person and they have no leverage to negotiate with the insurance company.
If you get open-heart surgery, the tab is $49,000. A Caesarean section birth, $7,500.
Remarkably, women of higher incomes have more Caesarean section births. I don't think that's related to a differential in the size of the birth canal; it's related to the ability to afford to pay.
And a visit to an orthopedist, $300 for the first visit, $175 for each visit after that.
Most people have become accustomed to good health care, even with these costs. The health care simply costs too much, more than it should cost.
When President Clinton proposed health care reform last year, none of us thought he was imagining the problem. There was consensus that we should act, we should do something. The political noise of the last 12 months aside, health care reform is as needed today as it was then. The families who need it are still here, in New Jersey and all of our states. The families that don't have the health care need it as much today as they did a year ago. All those of us who were paying health costs today are paying too much today, just as we were paying too much a year ago. . . .
It is the job of Government to protect the public health and welfare in the short and long term of its citizens.
How to do this in the area of health care is the essence of what this debate is all about. Our fundamental goal should be to enable a competitive health care marketplace to keep people healthy but take care of them when it does not.
By and large, America's health care system is an excellent system, but it does have a few glaring faults. We should block or undermine those elements that work in our current system. We should fix those areas that don't work, and in so doing, improve the overall system.
Recent trends suggest the health care markets are becoming more competitive and efficient. We can spur that process by insuring that insurance companies compete on price and quality, not on their ability to omit high-risk patients. Managed competition is beginning to bring better health care at lower prices to many Americans.

HEADLINE: Haitian Chief Buffs Image On the Streets

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Aug. 17

 BODY:
Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras strode confidently down the street, looking not like the dictator and impediment to democracy that Washington makes him out to be, but like an earnest candidate on the campaign trail.
Dressed in civilian clothes for a foray into the countryside on Monday, General Cedras shook hands, smiled and danced with his wife during a stop at a cantina as the television cameras focused on him. 
 After a career spent avoiding the limelight and exercising power from the shadows, the military strongman who toppled Haiti's elected civilian president, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, in a September 1991 coup has suddenly stepped out of the barracks and into the streets. During the last three weeks, General Cedras has made more public appearances than in the last three years.
 
A Public Relations Blitz
 To threats by the United States that it will invade Haiti if he does not step down, General Cedras has responded less with arms than with a public relations campaign. His Haitian supporters and foreign diplomats agree that the target of that effort is not just the Haitian public but also audiences abroad, mainly in the United States.
During his trip on Monday to the town of Petit-Goave, about 40 miles southwest of the capital, General Cedras actually had little to say. But the sight of the normally formal and dour commander in chief of the Haitian armed forces walking the streets in blue jeans, smiling and greeting the populace, sent a message: rather than backing down in the face of Washington's threat to invade, General Cedras remains confident, reasonable and in complete command.
"Threats to invade, or even the passage of Resolution 940 clearly don't mean anything to these people," one diplomat said, referring to the July 31 United Nations resolution that authorizes the United States and its allies to use "all necessary means" to overthrow the Haitian military.
That message has not been lost on Father Aristide's supporters, either. "Each day there is a new sign of the military's intention to stay," Micha Gaillard, a spokesman for Konakom, an umbrella group of pro-Aristide political organizations, said of General Cedras's recent high visibility.
 
A Campaign Stop?
 "He looked to me like he's thinking of running for president and that was the start of his campaign," another opposition leader said on Tuesay of General Cedras's outing on Monday. "It's a very smart thing for him to come out in public like that, because it signals his people that the boss is standing firm and isn't worried."
General Cedras's show of confidence has to some extent also undermined the economic sanctions imposed on Haiti that were intended to encourage the country's economic elite to move against the military.
"If you Americans think that business people can force the military to leave now, you're crazy," a leading businessman said last week, speaking on condition he not be identified. "What kind of pressure can we exert? If we go to Cedras and tell him he has to leave, he will laugh at us."
The position of General Cedras and his associates was bolstered further on Tuesday when, in remarks widely reported here, Secretary of Defense William Perry told NBC News that an invasion of Haiti would only be a last resort. Mr. Perry added that while the situation there continues to be of concern to Washington, Haiti was not of vital interest to the United States.
 
Family Man and Churchgoer
 General Cedras's campaign began in late July when he and his family showed up for dinner one night at a popular seafood restaurant in Petionville, the capital's most elite suburb, with a small security team and seated themselves at a table among the other diners. A few days later, he attended Sunday morning services at a Methodist church here, where he was filmed by American television crews that had been alerted in advance of his appearance.
At the same time, General Cedras was making himself available to selected reporters. In an interview with Robert Novak of CNN, General Cedras said he thought a United States invasion of Haiti was inevitable, and warned that American soldiers would be killed if they land here. But for the most part, General Cedras has avoided a belligerent tone and sought to portray himself as a patriot, family man and churchgoer.
The excursion into the countryside on Monday was preceded by an Assumption Day mass at the cathedral here, celebrated by a Roman Catholic bishop sympathetic to the military, that was also the culmination four days of "national reflection and prayer" on the crisis. General Cedras, a Protestant, attended the Catholic ceremony with all nine members of the military high command, an unusual concentration of top brass that seemed intended to dispel persistent rumors of divisions among the military leaders.
"He's pulling out all the stops, and showing that he can be very good at this sort of pubic relations thing," one diplomat said of General Cedras. "Of course, his position hasn't changed at all. But people are looking at him in a new light, and that itself is a victory for the Government."

HEADLINE: A Matter of Timing

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
In raising interest rates on Tuesday, the Federal Reserve invoked a belief that is dogma on Wall Street and often challenged elsewhere -- that the American economy is not capable of moving toward more prosperity now.
That view is not stated so baldly. Softer language is used. The nation does not have enough qualified workers to supply a stronger economy, the argument goes. Nor are there enough factories, machinery and computers, or enough steel and other materials used in manufacturing. So allowing economic growth to continue unchecked will result in too much competition for scarce resources and a lot of inflation. 
 This is sometimes the case. But there is evidence to suggest that now might be just the wrong moment to invoke the "capacity" argument, as the Fed has done, as a justification for raising interest rates to slow the economy.
The National Association of Manufacturers says plenty of elbow room exists for more production. The Federal Reserve's own statistics are not alarming. And even if capacity is running short, some economists, including the Fed's new vice chairman, Alan Blinder, say that not much extra inflation is likely to result.
"My view is that if you have a small overshooting of normal capacity, then you have a small acceleration of inflation," Mr. Blinder said in an interview the week before the Fed decided to make short-term interest rates a half-point higher.
Mr. Blinder, who joined the Fed this summer from President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers, voted for Tuesday's increase in the Federal funds rate, which banks charge one another for overnight loans, to 4.75 percent from 4.25 percent, and the discount rate, the rate the Fed charges for its own loans to banks, to 4 percent from 3.5 percent. But he differs, he said, from the prevailing view on the Fed, that overshooting on capacity by even a small amount will cause a big rise in inflation.
Whatever the viewpoint, everyone -- the economists, the politicians, business executives, bankers and labor leaders -- agrees on one point. If the Federal Reserve, which has raised interest rates five times this year, gets them high enough, then the economy will slow, capacity will go begging and fewer and fewer jobs will be created.
That is where the agreement ends and the debate begins. And with increasing openness it is a debate about the trade-off between jobs and inflation. "Governments today have only one effective way to control inflation: restrain economic growth," Peter L. Bernstein, an economic consultant, said. "In cruder terms, this means establishing and maintaining sufficient unemployment to keep labor costs under control."
Of course, if inflation rises fast enough and high enough, it almost certainly becomes a greater evil than the rising unemployment that results from slower economic growth and less use of capacity and people. The question is, is that likely to happen in the coming months?
Mr. Blinder seems less concerned that this will happen than Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, who expresses a view widely held on Wall Street: Inflation is likely to accelerate rapidly as more of the nation's capacity is employed, and then it becomes very hard to stop.
Although inflation today is only about 3 percent, the acceleration has begun, says David Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston, a Wall Street investment house. "In this environment, with companies operating at close to full capacity, a little expansion results in a sudden acceleration in inflation," he said.
Mr. Jones's firm has a stake in this debate. Its clients are people who have accumulated wealth and loan it out through various investments, including those managed by Wall Street firms like Lanston. For these people, and there are millions of them, inflation, or even the possibility of it, is anathema; it destroys the purchasing power of their savings. For the savers, inflation is a greater evil than joblessness, and, they say, nothing pushes up inflation faster than the demands for wage increases that come with rising employment.
 
 
'Leading Edge'
 "The wage issue is really one involving skilled labor," Mr. Jones said. "That is where the wage pressure begins to arise. We are getting pockets of skilled labor shortages around the country and they will become the leading edge for wage pressures that will spread."
Labor capacity, in sum, is being used up. But that is an assertion that the National Association of Manufacturers, no ally of wage pressures, flatly rejects. The association seldom criticizes the Federal Reserve but did so this week, appealing to the Fed on the eve of its meeting not to raise interest rates.
In doing so, the manufacturers' association gave the debate a different twist. True, it said, employment is rising and factories are using up more capacity than six months ago -- but there is no shortage of capacity, nor a danger of one.
"There has been too much looking at plant capacity and not enough examination of labor and that has led to an incorrect estimate of capacity utilization," said Gordon Richards, a senior economist at the association.
 
 
'Not Making Wage Demands'
 "There are large numbers of temporary, part-time and contract workers out there who are counted as employed but are in reality competing for permanent jobs, and they are not making wage demands," he said. "There are enormous amounts of disguised slack in the labor market."
Neither the view that capacity is ample, as Mr. Gordon argues, or in short supply, as Mr. Jones believes, is strongly supported -- or strongly undercut -- by Government statistics.
The Federal Reserve staff compiles the data on utilization of industrial capacity. The figures show that manufacturers, the key group, were using 83.1 percent of their capacity in July, which is slightly above the average of 81.2 percent for the years 1967 through 1993, and below the levels for the late 1970's (87.3 percent) and the late 1980's (85.1 percent). These were the last two periods of sharply rising inflation.
Sheets of steel are often cited as a prime example of a key material in short supply. American manufacturers are operating almost flat out in making this item and the price has risen by 12 percent over the last year. "But there is still plenty of capacity elsewhere in the world to make this steel and that puts a damper on sheet steel prices," said Walter Carter, the steel specialist at DRI/McGraw-Hill. "The prices of imported sheet steel have risen only 4 percent in the past year."
 
 
Unemployment Rate
 The Labor Department's unemployment number, a relatively low 6.1 percent in July, is similarly hard to evaluate. Many economists believe that it is low enough to signal nearly full employment and the beginning of labor shortages and wage pressures. But the unemployment rate is based on a monthly survey that the Labor Department revamped this year. Until the Department has had more experience with the survey, it will not be able to judge the accuracy of the unemployment figures, economists say.
Suppose the Fed had not raised rates on Tuesday? What might have happened? Mr. Jones and others argue that the economy would spurt ahead, beyond its capacity. And while plenty of jobs might be created, inflation would jump. Then the Federal Reserve's efforts to bring down inflation, through a big increase in interest rates, might create a recession and many of the people who got jobs would lose them. Better to create fewer jobs now and avoid the layoffs later, this argument goes.
But what if the economy were allowed to grow smartly now and inflation did not rise very strongly? "We don't have great shortages, with people waiting in line, and a let-it-rip approach would lead to only a modest increase in inflation," said Robert Gordon, a Northwestern University economist.
What's more, he added, even if the Fed did not exist and there were no one to manipulate interest rates, a robust economy would eventually slow down on its own. "That's the nature of business cycles," Mr. Gordon said. "And people would lose jobs."

Treasury Prices Mixed A Day After Fed Move

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were mixed yesterday, with longer maturities giving up a little of the gains made Tuesday in the wake of the Federal Reserve's move to increase short-term interest rates half a percentage point.
The 30-year bond fell 9/32 , to a price of 1019/32 , yielding 7.39 percent, up from 7.37 percent on Tuesday, following the market's biggest rally in two weeks after the Fed's fifth interest rate rise of the year. 
 Prices of shorter-maturity bills and intermediate-term notes increased with investors' confidence that the Fed is through for the moment in raising rates to fight inflation or the fear of it. The three-month bill rates dropped 4 basis points, to 4.56 percent, while a six-month rate was down a couple, to 4.91 percent.
Alan Kral, a portfolio manager for Trevor, Stewart, Burton & Jacobsen Inc., an investment management firm, said he was pleased how things had worked out. "I'm encouraged by the market's performance," he said. "We're bullish and think rates are coming down further," he said. "We are now six months into this cycle of interest rate hikes and inflation still has not shown in up in any of the indicators." There is no way, he added, that "we think inflation is going to go to 4.75 percent and eliminate the real rate of interest now set in the Federal funds rate." He said, "Mr. Greenspan, we think has achieved what he wanted."
With regard to the economy's rate of growth, Mr. Kral believes that since the economy is coming out of a slow growth period, it can handle a 3.5 percent rate of growth for a little longer, without sparking inflation, than some other analysts think. "I see the long bond rallying for the rest of the year," he said.
 
A Shift in Fed Policy
 According to a number of market analysts, the Fed increase on Tuesday disclosed one new point about the central bank's policy. There has been a shift in the strategy of the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, and the policy-making Federal Open Market Committee away from frequent quarter-point moves to a less frequent half-point moves.
Peter McTeague, a market analysts with MCM MoneyWatch in Boston, a market research and analysis firm, said his firm's latest weekly investor survey conducted on Monday just before the rate rise showed investors in their most defensive posture this year. "Now with many thinking the worst is out of the way, it would seem that the bulk of the selling is done for the near term and managers will be looking to put money to work," he said. He says that where they are most "under-invested" is in the 5-to-10-year maturities.
In the municipal bond market, prices received a boost from declining investor concern about inflation. It helped raise demand for the $2.2 billion in new securities coming to market.
One trader noted that the market is driven by greed and fear, and on Tuesday the Fed removed some of that fear.
In perhaps the week's largest debt offering, California priced $700 million of various-purpose general-obligation bonds that were won by Merrill Lynch in competitive bidding.
Serial bonds were priced to yield from 4.30 percent in 1996 to 6.05 percent in 2013 and 2014. Except for the bonds due in 1999, 2007 and 2019, which are rated A-1 by Moody's Investors Service and A by Standard & Poor's, the rest of the financing is insured by either the Ambac Indemenity Corporation, the Municipal Bond Investor's Assurance Corporation, or the Financial Guaranty Insurance Company and rated triple-A.
Underwriters said the deal was well recieved by the large institutional investors.
Goldman, Sachs won the Illinois offering of $687 million in 4 3/4 percent general obligation certificates. In the first part $187 million of certificates due April 17, 1995, were priced to yield 3.85 percent; $200 million due May 15, 1995, were priced to yield 3.95 percent, and $300 million of the certificates due June 15, 1995, were priced to yield 4 percent.
Underwriters said the deal was rated MIG-1 by Moody's and SP1+ by S.& P.

HEADLINE: Benjamin Esterman, 88, Dies; Ophthalmologist and Surgeon

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
Dr. Benjamin Esterman, an eye surgeon who helped found the specialized glaucoma clinic at the Manhattan Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital in 1936, died on Sunday at Peninsula Hospital Center in Far Rockaway, Queens. He was 88 and lived in Lawrence, L.I.
The cause was cancer, his family said. 
 In the 1960's, Dr. Esterman devised a simple and economical method of measuring loss of peripheral vision resulting from eye disease, injury or brain disorders. The American Academy of Ophthalmology honored him for it in 1972 and again two years ago, citing him also for his overall contributions in the field.
He was associated with Manhattan Eye, Ear and Throat for more than 40 years, performing thousands of operations and training hundreds of young physicians before his retirement in 1980. During those years he also worked at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center and served as director of eye surgery at Peninsula Hospital Center and Long Island Jewish Medical Center.
Born in Vilna, Lithuania, Dr. Esterman was brought to this country as an infant and grew up in Brooklyn. He graduated from Columbia College and Cornell University Medical School and completed his specialized training at New York Post-Graduate Hospital and Knapp Memorial Hospital.
He kept a private practice in Far Rockaway and Lawrence from 1937 until recently.
He contributed many articles to professional journals. He also wrote "The Eye Book, a Specialist's Guide to Your Eyes and Their Care," which was published by Great Ocean Publishers in 1977 and remains in print.
Dr. Esterman is survived by his wife of 21 years, Cinnabelle Morris Esterman; a daughter, Laura Esterman of Manhattan; three sons, Daniel of Manhattan, Mark of Arlington, Va., and the film maker Errol Morris of Cambridge, Mass., and seven grandchildren. His first wife, Sophie Milgram Esterman, died in 1968.

HEADLINE: Stocks End Day Mixed as Dow Falls 8.09

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
A day after the Federal Reserve Board raised interest rates, the stock market closed mixed but largely unchanged for big stocks.
Smaller over-the-counter stocks, however, continued their rally for the eighth session yesterday, magnifying Wednesday's gains. The bond market kept most of its price advance, but closed slightly lower. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 8.09 points, to 3,776.48, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 0.16 point, to 465.17. The Nasdaq composite index rose 7.15 points, to 742.66.
Blue chips like International Paper and J. P. Morgan fell, but drug stocks like Eli Lilly and Merck rose.
 
Big Rise in O-T-C Stocks
 The main news was the big rise in over-the-counter technology stocks. The Nasdaq index rise nearly tripled the gain of 2.62 points on Tuesday. Of the top 10 gainers in Nasdaq stocks, eight were technology or biotechnology stocks. Intel rose 23/16 , to 63 3/4, on traders' speculation that some computer makers will use Intel's Pentium microchip. Intell was the most active stock, at 9.7 million shares. Microsoft rose 1, to 55 7/8, while Cisco Systems rose 1 1/2, to 24.
The bond market fell a little, after the price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose more than one and a half points yesterday to 10118/32 . The price of the long bond fell 9/32 yesterday, and its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 7.39 percent from 7.37 percent.
The dollar fell yesterday, despite the Fed's interest-rate move, which pays foreigners and other investors more money to hold dollar-denominated assets. Commodity prices were largely unchanged, in part a reflection of traders' more optimistic outlook on inflation in the wake of the Fed move. The Commodity Research Bureau index rose 0.36 point, to 229.53, in part on price rises in lumber, cotton and soybean meal that were offset by falls in pork bellies and coffee.
 
Reaction to Fed Move
 The unsettled market reaction yesterday to the Fed's move stemmed from uncertainty as to how to assess the consequences of the increase. The move is sure to slow the economy further, bolstering bonds and strengthening the weak dollar, at least for yesterday.
But it would also weaken corporate profits and thus hurt stocks, at least for the short run. As the markets approach the Sept. 30 end of the third quarter, more traders are likely to grumble about poor quarterly earnings, as well as raise the specter of a Fed-caused recession.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 0.15 point, to 256.40, with advancing stocks outnumbering declining stocks, 1,190 to 963. The American Stock Exchange market value index rose 1.28 points, to 444.94.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was above normal, with 312.8 million shares changing hands.
Of the 30 component stocks that make up the Dow industrials, 14 fell, led by International Paper, which fell 1 1/4, to 71 7/8, on no immediate news. Of the 500 component stocks that make up the S.& P. 500, 186 rose, led by Eli Lilly, which rose 3, to 57 1/2..
Lilly's stock rose ahead of news that came out after the market closed that Lilly and Sphinx Pharmaceuticals had settled lawsuits blocking Lilly's acquisition of Sphinx.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS: Tapping the Briny Deep;
Pacific Ocean Spritzers By a California Venture

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: NEWPORT BEACH, Calif., Aug. 17

 BODY:
Trying to catch the wave of New Age soft drinks like Watermelon Kiwi and and Mango Madness, a California company plans to offer beverages with their own special ingredient: the Pacific Ocean.
The Seaborn Beverages Company says it is the first to make its drinks from desalinated ocean water, straight out of the Pacific. The company, based in Newport Beach, Calif., says it wants to sell the public on the "qualities and mystique of drinking a great-tasting, ultra-pure, ocean-water-based product." 
 Seaborn, which was started about a year and a half ago, plans to sell 1.15 million shares at $5 each in an initial public offering underwritten by La Jolla Securities. The company hopes to raise almost $5 million, which it plans to use to promote its drinks and take them beyond Southern California.
Some analysts are skeptical.
"When you think of desalinated water, you think of a pile of salt, and that's not the most romantic image," said Tom Pirko, an analyst with Bevmark Inc., a soft drink consulting company.
Desalination is usually an expensive process used in parts of the world where there are shortages of water, like Saudi Arabia. Seaborn's water is drawn from a depth of 500 feet about 30 miles off the California coast, near Santa Catalina Island. The water is transported to Seaborn's desalination plant in Long Beach, Calif.
There are economic and environmental benefits to desalinating water, said Frederik Rodenhuis, Seaborn's 39-year-old chief executive. It costs Seaborn no more to desalinate its water than it does for competitors to filter their spring water, he said.
While natural spring water brands like Evian and Perrier can promote the purity of their products, experts say ocean water, stripped of salt and other chemicals, is just, well, water. "I think it's a gimmick," said Kevin Olmstead, a civil engineering professor at the University of Detroit Mercy. "There aren't any health benefits in desalinated water that I'm aware of."
So far, Seaborn has been struggling. The company lost $751,400 between its inception on Feb. 1, 1993, and Dec. 31, while generating no revenues. Its accumulated deficit is $993,500.
In the company's prospectus, Seaborn's auditor, Arthur Andersen & Company, acknowledges the investing risk, saying, "The absence of significant revenues and the need to raise additional capital raise a substantial doubt about the company's ability to continue as a going concern."
Nonetheless, Mr. Rodenhuis is optimistic. "I think we really have something special here," he said.

Prices of Crude Oil Surge As Tensions Rise in Nigeria

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Crude oil prices staged a late rally yesterday after Nigeria's military ruler indicated that he would scrap the leadership of the country's striking oil workers' unions, creating a climate for intensified clashes.
In a speech to be delivered by Gen. Sani Abacha, the Government said it would appoint administrators to run the affairs of the unions and the Nigeria Labor Congress, the nation's largest trade union. 
 At the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil for September delivery, the most active contract, closed 38 cents higher at $18.11 a barrel after hitting 13-week lows early in the day.
"I can't see it being resolved and it appears to be moving toward civil war," said Tom Bentz of Quantum Financial Services.
Nigeria, the 10th-largest OPEC producer, exports 1.6 million barrels a day. The shipments have been largely maintained during the six-week strike by oil workers, who walked out in support of Moshood K. O. Abiola, who is believed to be winner of the 1993 election, which was annulled by the military Goverment. He was arrested on treason charges after he declared himself president on the anniversary of the election.
Government negotiators did not show up yesterday for scheduled talks with union leaders, who said they would order attacks against oil plants if the Government deposed them.
"The Government not showing up for the meeting with the unions was substantial," said Mark Tunkel, an oil trader at Daiwa Securities America. "The sentiment is that we may start to see more problems in the next week or two."
Gasoline prices also rose yesterday. Domestic inventory data from the American Petroleum Institute showed gas supplies dropped 2.65 million barrels last week. Gasoline for September delivery rose 1.61 cents, to 56.53 cents a gallon.
In other commodity markets, coffee prices plummeted while cotton and soybean prices rose. The Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 commodities rose 0.36 point, to 229.53.
Coffee prices reversed course after rising sharply rising Monday as it became apparent to traders that coffee roasters were not rushing in to buy. Coffee beans for September delivery sank 12.5 cents, to $1.7945 a pound, on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York.
Talk of a large export sale of cotton to Asian countries and reports of damage to Georgia's cotton crop from the remnants of Tropical Storm Beryl lifted cotton prices.
"We do expect some damage to the cotton crop as a result of continued excessive rains Georgia has had for the past two months," said Don Shurley, an agricultural economist in Tifton, Ga., with the University of Georgia.
Cotton for October delivery jumped 0.94 cent, to 68.93 cents a pound, on the New York Cotton Exchange.

Some analysts think now is the time to buy steel stocks.

BYLINE: By John Holusha 

 BODY:
IS now a good time to buy steel stocks? Some people think so. The industry certainly is having a spectacular year after a decade of sagging orders, slumping prices and plant closings.
Steel shipments in the first half of the year rose 5.8 percent, to almost 47 million tons, the highest level in 13 years, the American Iron and Steel Institute, the principal trade group, reported recently. The American industry is running flat out and is expected to do so for at least another year. 
 The comeback is more than cyclical, analysts say. The revival in the Rust Belt means that manufacturers are increasing their use of steel and consumption is increasing relative to the general level of economic growth. The last time that happened was in the late 1950's.
According to the institute, steel use by auto manufacturers was up 17.1 percent, construction and contractors' products were up 7.8 percent, and machinery, industrial equipment and tools gained 7.4 percent in the six months ended in June.
With demand booming, steel producers have been demanding, and getting, price increases. Two rounds of spot-market price increases earlier this year have stuck and another is due Jan 1. Prices in longer-term contract markets are going up as well, with the automobile companies expected to pay 7 percent to 10 percent more for a material whose inflation-adjusted price has been declining for a decade.
It doesn't really matter if it is 7 percent or 10 percent, said Michelle G. Applebaum, a steel industry analyst with Salomon Brothers. "It has been zero for the last dozen years."
The chief beneficiaries of this flat-out demand for steel have been the big, integrated mills, the ones that make steel from iron ore and coal, Ms. Applebaum said. Mini-mills, which make steel from scrap, are facing a pinch as demand is forcing the price of scrap higher.
Steel companies like to complain about imports, but much of the steel that is being imported now is raw slabs for processing to fill the gap between the companies' capacity to produce liquid metal and the volume of customer orders. Customers are reportedly paying premium prices for imports of finished steel, rather than turning to them as a low-cost alternative, as in the past.
Ms. Applebaum has buy recommendations on most steel stocks, but said she particularly favored Bethlehem, Inland and U. S. Steel. Part of the reason, she said, is that they are large-capitalization, actively traded stocks. "Liquidity is an issue, and these are very liquid," she added.
Inland, she noted, is a steel distributor as well as a manufacturer, and there is room for growth in distribution even while the company's steel making is straining against capacity limits. All three are heavily focused on the flat-rolled business, which stands to benefit from price increases for steel used in automobiles and appliances.
Charles A. Bradford of UBS Securities is also recommending Inland and Bethlehem, but urges a degree of caution: "The time to buy these stocks is when nobody likes them, when the multiple is high because they don't have any earnings. The time to sell is when the multiples are low because they are at peak earnings."
Are we at or near the peak? Probably not, Mr. Bradford said. "The peak will probably come some time next year; there is probably some room to go."
A flashing red light and loud gong of a sell signal would be if any of the big, integrated mills announced that they were going to significantly add to production capacity. "These guys always wanted to have the capacity to sell the last ton in a peak year and that means they have expensive capacity sitting around idle 80 percent of the time," he said. "That's what imports are for, to satisfy peak demand."

Dollar Slips a Bit as Traders Await Move by Bundesbank

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar drifted lower in quiet trading yesterday as traders awaited a signal from Germany's Bundesbank about the direction of European interest rates.
Some traders speculated that the Bundesbank's rate-setting council, which meets today, might lower rates or signal future monetary easing. 
 The meeting of the German central bank follows increases on Tuesday by the Federal Reserve of half a percentage point in two key interest rates: the discount rate and the Federal funds rate.
 
Rate Gap Narrows
The Fed's move narrowed the gap between short-term American interest rates and higher German rates, making dollar-based investments more competitive. A Bundesbank easing would further close the gap.
"People were looking for two shoes to drop," said David Glowacki, senior trader at National Bank of Detroit. "They expected the Fed to raise rates, which it did. Now, we're waiting for the other shoe to drop from the Bundesbank."
In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar slipped to 1.5524 German marks from 1.5585 marks on Tuesday. The dollar was also weaker against the Japanese yen, falling to 100.13 yen, from 100.50 on Tuesday.
 
Italian and Swedish Moves
Today's Bundesbank meeting, the first after a monthlong summer recess, is viewed as especially important after the Italian and Swedish central banks increased interest rates last week. Those increases caused fear of possible rising inflation in Europe and cast doubt on the potential for significant easing by the Bundesbank.
If the Bundesbank does not act today, it would leave Germany's discount rate at 4.5 percent, compared with the 4 percent discount rate set by the Fed on Tuesday. That would probably hurt the dollar, however, traders said. They noted that the dollar was vulnerable after a disappointing performance lately.
"The dollar is acting rather poorly given the bold move by the Fed," said Ross Taylor, head of foreign exchange at the Daiwa America Corporation. "People were expecting a strong rally and they didn't get one."
In other currency trading in New York yesterday, the dollar was quoted at 1.3058 Swiss francs, down from 1.3114 on Tuesday; 5.3287 French francs, down from 5.3545, and 1,590 Italian lire, down from 1,594. The British pound rose to $1.5415, from $1.5395 Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Russian Controls on Bomb Material Are Leaky

SERIES: After the Arms Race: The Next Nuclear Threat -- First of three articles.

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON with MATTHEW L. WALD, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MOSCOW

 BODY:
Russia has no way of knowing for sure if any of its vast supply of bomb ingredients is missing, many of its own nuclear officials and scientists admit.
An investigation of nuclear security in Russia, including interviews with numerous officials and independent experts in Moscow and in Siberia, where many nuclear materials are kept, reveals that the country is far from establishing an effective system for protecting and accounting for the plutonium and highly enriched uranium, the critical ingredients for making nuclear weapons. 
 Much of the West's focus in recent years has been directed at keeping any of Moscow's 30,000 warheads from falling into the hands of terrorists or nations like Iraq and Iran that have nuclear ambitions. But Russia's supplies of nuclear bomb materials are also spread across scores of less closely guarded research institutes, weapons laboratories and assembly plants, power plants, nuclear waste storage facilities, naval fuel depots and other installations.
In the past, authorities here relied on a system of rewards for its nuclear elite and the iron grip of the Soviet state to protect nuclear materials. Now, when citizens travel freely and wheel and deal, when criminal syndicates marshall vast economic resources while workers and even scientists are sometimes not paid for months, protection of bomb materials requires far closer and constant scrutiny, many Western and Russian experts say.
"We would like to bring some order to the area of stockpile accountability," said Yuri Vishevsky, the director of Gosatomnadzor or GAN, a Russian agency loosely modeled on the United States' Nuclear Regulatory Commission. "Unfortunately today, there are too many possessors of nuclear material. We have to find out who possesses nuclear materials and get them to carry out an inventory."
In the face of repeated German seizures of plutonium and highly enriched uranium that German officials say were smuggled from Russia, the head of the Ministry of Atomic Energy here charges that Western intelligence agencies have mounted a plot to discredit the Russian nuclear establishment, leaping to blame Russia without proof.
But many Russian and American experts say Russia's nuclear network is so balkanized and its system of checks so uncertain that no one can say for sure whether any of its nuclear bomb material -- which totals some 170 tons of military and civilian plutonium and 1,000 tons of highly enriched uranium, according to Western estimates -- has been lost or stolen. The challenge is especially great because the amount of plutonium needed to make a bomb, several kilograms, is no bigger than a can of soda.
President Boris N. Yeltsin has signed lofty summit statements pledging to improve nuclear security and publicly exhorted Russia's intelligence services to crush "any attempt to gain unauthorized access to nuclear components."
The United States, for its part, has earmarked $133 million to help Russia prevent nuclear thefts, and Clinton Administration officials say that Russian and American nuclear specialists are beginning to cooperate in ways that would have been unthinkable during the Cold War.
But calling for change on the nuclear front and mustering the political will, money and organization to carry it out are two different things. Russian and American officials say that reform has been hampered by lack of funds and inattention from Russia's fractious Parliament.
Significantly, proposed changes have also run into resistance from Russia's Ministry of Atomic Energy, Minatom. Its powerful chief, Viktor N. Mikhailov, was a senior nuclear official going back to Soviet days. In 1993 he wrote an autobiography, "I'm a Hawk," covering his career in weapons development.
He is openly suspicious of Western intentions and determined to preserve his nuclear domain. Of the suggestion that Russia is vulnerable to nuclear theft, he said, "There are certain groups, intelligence services in the West, which promote this opinion to undermine Minatom."
Ambassador James Goodby, the American official who has led the talks with Russia to strengthen its nuclear controls, said, "There has been some progress, but it has been very, very slow going. The worry is that something could happen that would throw us into a tail spin."
 
The Past
Loosening The Controls
 In the past, Washington's main worry was not the security of Russia's nuclear materials, but its burgeoning arsenal of nuclear-tipped missiles and bombs that were aimed at the United States.
Russia's system for protecting bomb-grade materials had its limitations. Russian officials kept account of how much plutonium and highly enriched uranium was produced and distributed to physics research centers and reactors, weapons laboratories, nuclear fuel fabrication plants and other installations.
But officials rarely conducted inspections or detailed measurements to check how much was still there. Each institute or laboratory, in effect, kept its own account.
"Probably the most deficient component of Minatom's safeguards is the system of material control and accounting," wrote Oleg Bukharin, a Russian physicist who is now a visiting scholar at Princeton University.
 
Monitoring System Blocked
 Yevgeny P. Velikhov, former President Mikhael S. Gorbachev's science adviser and the director of the Kurchatov Institute, a research center that has been working to design a new system of nuclear safeguards, said in an interview he had advocated a system of independent monitoring of the disparate nuclear installations, only to be rebuffed by the nuclear agency and security services.
"It is possible to present it as a national system, but this does not exist in reality," Mr. Velikhov said.
While the theft of a nuclear warhead poses the greatest potential threat, the plutonium and highly enriched uranium at scattered research centers, power plants and other sites are far more vulnerable. Less well protected than military installations, many of Russia's once-prestigious nuclear research institutes have become collections of ill-paid specialists, who may, many experts fear, be vulnerable to bribes.
While most of the former Soviet Union's nuclear laboratories and installations are in Russia, much the same vulnerability exists in the other former Soviet states, like Belarus and Ukraine.
Adding to Western concern, classified American intelligence reports indicate that well-financed agents of Middle Eastern nations are operating in the former Soviet Union, prompting fears that they could be seeking bomb materials.
At the Institute of Physics and Power Engineering at Obninsk, 60 miles outside Moscow, storage site for nearly a ton of enriched uranium, enough for dozens of bombs, as well as plutonium, officials deny that their materials have turned up in Germany. But they do not deny that they have a serious security problem.
 
Once a Closed Area
 During the Cold War, Obninsk was a closed area, off-limits to foreigners and to Russians without special permission. But now foreigners and Russian citizens can travel freely to the area, which contains a large network of nuclear laboratories connected by above-ground steam pipes.
Salaries at the institute, where the world's first commercial-scale nuclear reactor was built, are down about 70 percent during the last five years, and about a third of the staff has left.
"Our headache is the problem of materials that have a significant price," said Igor P. Matveyenko, the director of the institute's division of experimental physics. "We've put it in samples that it's possible to pocket," he added, as he slipped a stainless steel disk about the size of a hockey puck into the pocket of his white lab coat.
That disc contained lead, but Mr. Matveyenko has thousands of such disks, some with highly enriched uranium, some with natural uranium, some with weapons-grade plutonium, some with reactor-grade plutonium. These disks, not too dangerous to handle or transport, are used to fuel a small research reactor.
To protect the material, engineers have taken some steps. The foot-thick door between the control room and the reactor room, where the disks are used, was opened regularly when the reactor was not running. Now it is normally locked shut and employees walk through another door fitted with a radiation detector that can sense when a disk is passing through.
But Mr. Matveyenko said he needs more money, to buy equipment to monitor security and to develop inventory control procedures. Moreover, he stressed, equipment alone will not solve the problem. Unless salaries are raised, some researchers may find nuclear smuggling too great a temptation to resist.
"There are dishonest men in various levels, including in the bureaucracy," he said. "It's possible to buy anything in our country, including weapons and samples."
Anatoly V. Vorobyov, deputy head of the institute's international department, agreed that security was a problem. "We need to trust every person in this laboratory," he said.
 
The Response
Reforming The System
 To improve its controls, Russia is trying to create a system of independent oversight and is also working with Washington to better protect Russia's supply of plutonium. It has also pledged to stop further production of weapons-grade plutonium. But these efforts have slowed to a crawl.
President Yeltsin has called on GAN to oversee Russia's sprawling network of nuclear laboratories, power plants and institutes.
From the start, recalled Aleksei V. Yablokov, an adviser to Mr. Yeltsin on environmental issues, Gen. Pavel S. Grachev, the head of the Russian Ministry of Defense, and Mr. Mikhailov of the Atomic Energy Ministry fought to limit the regulatory's agency's authority to oversee their agencies' installations.
And top officials from GAN said they still lack the legal authority from Russia's Parliament, the funds and the inspectors and equipment to do their job effectively.
"We are only at the beginning of the road in creating a national system of accounting," said Stanislav D. Loutsev, the deputy head of safeguards at GAN.
 
Shortcomings in System
 "We do inspections, but not in the scale and volume we would like," he added. "We do not have the legal basis. The measurements we have made are not very accurate because we do not have the necessary instruments."
As a result, Mr. Loutsev acknowledged, it is impossible to tell if nuclear materials at some of Russia's installations have been stolen, used up or simply lost track of.
His boss, Mr. Vishevsky, estimated that it would take five to seven years, and about $1 billion, to get the system under control. But his agency's total budget this year is about $7 million.
Clinton Administration officials also say that the lack of procedures and equipment for measuring nuclear materials and detecting efforts to divert it is a major weakness and that Western help is needed to correct it.
Critics complain, however, that of the $1.2 billion Washington has budgeted to help arms reduction efforts in the former Soviet Union, only $133 million has been earmarked to protect bomb-usable plutonium and uranium. The remainder is dedicated to tasks such as helping Russia dismantle its missiles and transporting warheads from the former Soviet republics to Russia.
"Not one single improvement has been made in the physical security or material control and accounting at a fixed site in Russia as a consequence of funds allocated by Congress, " said Thomas B. Cochran, senior scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, a private environmental group in Washington.
But Clinton Administration officials say that the United States has been unable to spend the relatively modest funds it has allocated for strengthening Russia's nuclear controls because of resistance from Minatom, where Mr. Mikhailov has been wary of Western intentions and reluctant to give American experts wide-ranging access to nuclear sites.
When American officials offered $10 million to help set up a model system of controls for bomb-grade materials, for example, Russian officials proposed that the safeguards be established instead at a section of a fuel-fabrication plant near Moscow that handles low-enriched uranium, which does not present a threat.
More recently, the Clinton Administration has offered $10 million in aid to make "quick fixes" in controls at nuclear sites. Russian officials recently toured the United States' Hanford nuclear reservation to study the American system of safeguards and have arranged for a reciprocal visit by American experts to their civilian plutonium storage site at Mayak in the Ural Mountains. But they have yet to take up the $10 million dollar offer.
The Clinton Administration also offered a further $10 million to the Russians so that they could upgrade their controls at the site where Russia is transforming bomb-usable highly enriched uranium into low enriched uranium for sale to the United States. But Russian officials said that the aid was unnecessary.
Other American initiatives have also been moving slowly. To protect the vast stores of plutonium Russia is recovering from its dismantled warheads and to encourage Moscow to continue its arms reductions, the United States is contributing $91 million to help Russia design, build and equip the first of two planned storage installations. The United States Energy Department came up with an extra $1 million to pay a St. Petersburg company to design the installation after the Russian Government failed to make the payment.
American officials had hoped that Russia would begin building the installation this summer, but construction has yet to start.
A widely publicized Clinton Administration effort to dissuade Moscow from producing even more plutonium requires difficult economic problems that Russian authorities have been reluctant to confront.
In a June agreement with the United States, Russia has pledged to shut down by the year 2000 plutonium-producing reactors in Tomsk-7 and Krasnoyarsk-26, which are simultaneously used to heat the surrounding Siberian communities. But Russia's cash-starved authorities have taken few steps to build the costly coal and gas fueled plants that would be needed to replace them.
 
The Future
Plugging The Leaks
 Chainsmoking cigarettes in his Moscow headquarters, the chief of Minatom, Mr. Mikhailov, is not worried about the slow progress of the efforts to strengthen its controls.
"There are certain problems of control, but they exist everywhere, especially today, when large scale dismantling is going on," Mr. Mikhailov said.
He dismissed reports of diversion of Russian nuclear materials as a "provocation" by Western intelligence agencies to discredit Moscow's nuclear establishment.
American officials, particularly those at the Department of Energy, which is deeply involved in the effort to assist Russia, say it is too soon to declare failure.
 
Direct Ties Sought
 They say that dealing with the new Russia requires patience. American officials also note that the United States is also trying to sidestep Minatom by encouraging American nuclear laboratories to cooperate directly with Mr. Velikhov's Kurchatov Institute and other nuclear institutes. The Clinton Administration has allocated $12 million for this new effort through 1995 and would like to spend $50 million on such laboratory cooperation in 1996.
American officials also say they have sought to guard against theft by helping establish an international center in Russia to support former weapon scientists and by trying to negotiate an agreement that would enable American inspectors to monitor nuclear materials from dismantled warheads.
Mr. Velikhov, for his part, said that international pressure was having some effect. But he was skeptical that an rigorous nationwide system of modern equipment an trained personnel will be put into place.
"The most critical problem is funding, and I am not very optimistic," said Mr. Velikhov. "With the situation with the American budget, it does not seem like there will be billions and billions of dollars to spend on Russia. And on our side there is our bureaucracy and the inefficiency of our government system today.
 
 
 
MAKING BOMBS: DESIGN CRUCIAL
 Obtaining a sufficient quantity of plutonium or highly enriched uranium may be the most difficult task facing a would-be bomb-builder, but it is hardly the only challenge. Equally essential are a design, high explosives and advanced electronic equipment.
The designs of bombs in government arsenals, which aim to get the most explosive force from a quantity of fuel, are secret. But the general principles for making a fission weapon are widely known among scientists. In 1978 an undergraduate at Princeton University submitted a bomb design as a paper in a physics class; the United States Government said it would work and classified his paper.
At the core of the simplest plutonium bombs are hollow spheres of plutonium, not quite concentrated enough to constitute the "critical mass" needed to sustain a chain reaction. Conventional explosives, detonated with precise timing, squeeze the mass together quickly at the same instant that another device in the bomb introduces neutrons to set off the chain reaction.
Uranium bombs can be even simpler; the first one, which was not even field tested before it was dropped on Hiroshima 49 years ago this month, used something resembling an artillery piece to merge two masses of uranium and create a critical mass.
A would-be bomb-builder would also have to procure electronic devices the sales of which are closely monitored by Western governments.

HEADLINE: Blacks Make Boycott Hurt A Small Town

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BATTLEBORO, N.C., Aug. 12

 BODY:
No one disputes the origins of the episode last April 20. Marilyn B. Powell, while driving her car, noticed that her niece had been stopped at an intersection where two white police officers were checking licenses and seat belts. Mrs. Powell, who is black, pulled over and asked the officers to let her take a 3-week-old infant from her niece's car because of the heat. The police told her to wait, and she objected.
Accounts of the scuffle that followed differ, but by the time it ended, Mrs. Powell, a 36-year-old substitute teacher and nurse's aide with no police record, had been sprayed with Mace and charged with three misdemeanor counts of disobeying, resisting and assaulting a police officer. 
 The ensuing turmoil in Battleboro, which has a population of 524 and is 45 percent black, has forced attention on complaints by blacks here and in other small, isolated towns that police harassment is routine, and it has fanned long-simmering complaints of economic and political bias.
Only white men serve in Battleboro's police department, on its five-member Board of Commissioners and on its seven-member Planning Board. The Mayor is also white. To press their demands for a black police chief, blacks have banded together into a group called Concerned Citizens of Battleboro and have staged an effective boycott against white-owned businesses.
On July 30, the town's biggest retail store and second-biggest taxpayer, a Red and White supermarket, went out of business, saying the boycott had cost it 25 percent of its business.
With blacks doing more of their shopping in Rocky Mount, six miles to the south, several other businesses are ailing. "Faces I used to see every day don't come in anymore," said Robert Hayes, the proprietor of the Kitchen Korner restaurant. He said the town's commissioners "have done absolutely nothing" to try to accommodate black residents.
Blacks have yet to get a black police chief, but partly because of the dispute the department has been reduced from three full-time officers and three part-timers to just one: the Chief, David Snyder.
Impressed by the events in Battleboro, black politicians in the region say the stage is set for protests in more small towns where accusations of police brutality are commonplace. "Battleboro is a first," said the Rev. Dr. Thomas L. Clark, pastor of the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Rocky Mount and a commissioner of Edgecombe County, which shares jurisdiction over Battleboro with Nash County. "The benefits that are going to come of this are enormous. They showed they had economic power even though they're politically powerless." In June, the Rev. Jesse Jackson led a demonstration here in support of the boycott.
Mrs. Powell, who is preparing to sue the town, declined to discuss the April incident on the advice of her lawyer. Her friends say the police officers hit her first. Chief Snyder claims that Mrs. Powell struck first and that the officers were trying to prevent trouble rather than start it.
In a report in July, Howard S. Boney Jr., the area District Attorney, said the police had acted "overzealously" and ordered the charges against Mrs. Powell dropped. But he said the officers had not broken the law or acted with malice or racial hostility. That report enraged many civil rights leaders in the state.
Battleboro, in eastern North Carolina, is in many respects an easygoing place. Residents of both races say blacks and whites coexist uneventfully in schools, farms, shops and the nearby factory of Abbott Laboratories, a pharmaceutical company.
The harmonious racial mingling ceases away from the main intersection. Most well-off white families live on large lots on the west side of Highway 301. A few black and some white families live along a semi-industrial strip on the highway's east side, where most homes are smaller. That area stops at the railroad tracks, parallel to the highway, where the town spreads from Nash County into Edgecombe County. The population on the other side of the tracks, both within the town and for several blocks beyond, is almost exclusively black.
Those who reside within the town limits pay property taxes to the town and receive its services, and they can vote and run for town office. But no one here recalls any blacks running for office -- perhaps, blacks say, because they would stand little chance of winning. Commissioners are elected citywide, not by district. With whites in the majority, no one from a predominantly black area can win when people vote along racial or neighborhood lines.
 
Pocketbook Issues
 For those blacks who live a few blocks beyond the tracks, where the town's unincorporated section begins, the complaints are mainly economic.
Households in the unincorporated area do not pay the town's property taxes and other small levies, and the people who live there cannot vote in town elections. But most buy water from the town, and they pay twice the fees of people in the town -- typically about $80 a month for a family of four, compared with $40 in town.
Such differences in fees are common in North Carolina because of the cost of laying water lines in rural areas. Here, however, most of the blacks in the unincorporated section live just a block or two from people who pay the lower fees.
Those blacks are asking to be annexed to the town, in part so they can have the political power to contest the fees. Annexation could give blacks a majority of the town's votes, depending on the size of the annexed area.
Neighborhoods can petition to be annexed, but the process is fraught with delays and confusion. Dr. Clark said it required such legal and technical expertise that it would stymie people in unincorporated areas who had little experience with bureaucracy.
Decades of complaints over water bills and the lack of political power for the unincorporated area had no effect on the town until the arrest of Mrs. Powell in April. Since then, many whites in Battleboro have also found fault with the police. "They try to do a good job, but they do the job to the extreme" in enforcing local laws, said Mr. Hayes, the restaurateur.
Jerry P. Bulluck, a commissioner who owns a convenience store in the black area just outside town, called the department "overaggressive."
 
The Chief Is Alone
 But Chief Snyder, who has been in Battleboro for two years, defends his performance. "When I got here, we went out and enforced the law pro-actively," he said. By pro-actively, he said, he meant acting to prevent or deter crime rather than reacting to it. "Any department that pro-actively enforces the law will be accused of being overzealous," he said.
Chief Snyder is now the only police officer in Battleboro; county police officers handle any serious incidents when he is not on duty. Within days of Mrs. Powell's arrest by two police officers, one officer resigned to take a job in another town. The second was assigned to desk duty, and he resigned early this month. On Aug. 2, the Battleboro commissioners, without explanation, voted to stop the use of three part-time officers.
When he had a full force, Chief Snyder quintupled the town's revenues from fines, most of them for speeding and seat-belt violations.
But for James Berkley, the head of Concerned Citizens of Battleboro, tougher enforcement amounts to harassment. He said the police had tailed his wife, night after night, from her job at Abbott Laboratories until she was finally stopped for speeding.
Many people in town, white and black, like the idea of a black police chief, or at least some black officers. But solving the problem may involve more than promising to recruit black officers.
Chief Snyder said that he had hired a black officer last year but that he had stayed only one month. Like all new officers here, he was paid $6 an hour, about the lowest police wage in the nation. "He left to take a job making $10," Chief Snyder said.

HEADLINE: THE HEALTH CARE DEBATE: THE MIDDLE GROUND;
Health Debate Has a Senator In a Crossfire

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 18

 BODY:
The health care battlefield around Senator John H. Chafee is littered with the corpses of good ideas gone bad.
The Rhode Island Republican, praised by Democrats for his moderate leanings but distrusted by some Republicans for his efforts toward bipartisan compromise, is leading the movement to get influential senators to devise a health care formula that is comprehensive, cost-conscious and middle-of-the-road. 
 It is a task that becomes more tangled every day for Mr. Chafee, a 71-year-old New England patrician, who has been working on health care issues since he became Governor of Rhode Island in 1963.
"Everything's a struggle," he said with a sigh today as he began another day of behind-the-scenes meetings and debate that ended with an announcement tonight that an agreement on a proposed compromise had been reached.
 
A Mitchell-Dole Struggle
 In many ways, the immediate political fight over health care has become a struggle between two political leaders. Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the majority leader, has introduced an alternative that is being picked apart in public on the Senate floor and in private by fellow Democrats who worry that it is too dense and tax-heavy to succeed.
Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the minority leader, has sponsored his own measure, and complains that the "mainstream coalition" undercuts Republican arguments that the health care system may be cracked, but not broken.
Running the coalition has fallen largely to Mr. Chafee, a three-term Senator who is seeking re-election this fall. Although he holds no official leadership role in the Senate, he has welcomed as many as 20 senators to the daily meetings that began as once-a-week breakfast sessions four years ago.
Mr. Chafee is joined at the group's core by two other moderate Republicans, Senators John C. Danforth of Missouri and Dave Durenberger of Minnesota, but the sessions have expanded to include Democrats like Senators Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, Bill Bradley of New Jersey, David L. Boren of Oklahoma and John B. Breaux of Louisiana.
 
In Search of a Consensus
 Participants say they fret, debate, vote and then often begin debating again as they search for a consensus each day. But their efforts are viewed with suspicion by many Republicans, who maintain that Mr. Chafee is consorting with the enemy.
"What I don't want are three Republicans -- Senators Danforth, Durenberger and Chafee -- trying to direct the rest of us, 40 of us, where we should go," Mr. Dole groused on the NBC News program "Meet the Press" last weekend.
Mr. Mitchell, by contrast, has eagerly encouraged the activities of the Chafee group, even though several of its members have said that his health care alternative is unacceptable. He met with them on Wednesday, and Senators Sam Nunn of Georgia, a Democrat, and Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, a Republican, met with the group today to discuss their own compromise legislation.
Mr. Chafee is sanguine about the criticism he has attracted as his mainstream coalition has become the center of gravity -- and a target of criticism -- in the health care debate.
"There's no question but that there are people in the Republican Party who want to do nothing," the Senator said in an interview this morning.
"The changes we are proposing will have cost containment and will increase the coverage.," he added. "And if the President gets some credit out of it, so be it, but we just can't keep from doing anything in a whole variety of areas because somebody says, 'Oh the President will take credit for it.' "
This attitude has won Senator Chafee some quiet support from White House officials, who fear they would doom the coalition's efforts if they endorsed them publicly. Any compromise on health care, they say privately, is better than no bill at all.
"The problem is the political pressure, and whether he can withstand it," one White House official said.
Mr. Chafee's opponents are counting on the disagreements to split the group as it searches for the center.
"To the extent that Chafee is trying to lead a substantial amount of Republicans to work with Mitchell, I think he'll fail," said Bill Kristol, the former adviser to Vice President Dan Quayle who heads the Project for a Republican Future, a conservative group. "A huge majority of Republicans feel Mitchell's bill fundamentally goes in the wrong direction and is unimprovable."
On the opposite side of the political spectrum, proponents of universal coverage, provisions for long-term care and other benefits financed by employer contributions contend that their principles -- originally championed by President Clinton -- are being consistently traded away.
 
'An Exercise in Minimalism'
 "The proposals by the mainstream group become less and less meaningful," said Ron Pollack, a supporter of the Clinton plan who is executive director of Families USA. "Soon the word 'reform' has no content to it."
"There is no question it's moving," he said of the negotiations. "It's moving in a negative way, and it's becoming an exercise in minimalism."
But Senator Chafee has managed to disagree with all sides without squandering the good will he built in years of crossing party lines to work with Senator Mitchell on the Clean Air Act or to walk lockstep with his colleagues to defeat Mr. Clinton's $16.3 billion economic stimulus package last year.
"I strongly disagree with John Chafee on health care," said Senator Phil Gramm, the Texas Republican. "But as a human being, the Lord didn't make any senators who are any better than John Chafee."
Mr. Chafee's military background may serve him well as he deals with political crossfire and mine fields. He enlisted in the Marine Corps soon after the United States entered World War II, and landed on Guadalcanal as a 19-year-old private in August 1942. He was later commissioned a second lieutenant and saw combat on Okinawa. After receiving a bachelor's degree from Yale in 1947 and a law degree from Harvard in 1950, he was recalled to active duty in the Korean War, where he served as a rifle company commander.
After 35 years in Rhode Island politics, Mr. Chafee faces this autumn's race for a fourth term with a measure of security unusual for a Republican holding office in a heavily Democratic state. He served as Governor for three terms, but was ousted in 1968 after advocating a state income tax.
He served briefly as Secretary of the Navy under President Richard M. Nixon, then returned to Rhode Island to challenge the state's senior Senator, Claiborne Pell, only to be defeated once again. But by 1976, Mr. Chafee had re-established his support among independents, and took advantage of disarray in the Democratic Party to gain enough support to win election to the Senate.
For a time, Mr. Chafee was Hillary Rodham Clinton's favorite Republican. He now says it has been months since he talked to her.
But the Senator continues to show up for work every day, drinks his hot, honey-sweetened tea and prepares to arm-wrestle a workable health care bill onto the Senate floor.
His power over the centrist Democrats and Republicans he leads, he said, is fleeting. "Senator Lieberman said they gave me papal authority," Mr. Chafee said, referring to the mainstream group. "But it doesn't amount to much."

HEADLINE: Trade Deficit In June Was A Bit Smaller

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
In a report that analysts said reflected a recovering global economy, the Commerce Department reported yesterday that the nation's monthly trade deficit fell slightly in June.
The 1.6 percent decline, to a seasonally adjusted $9.37 billion, from $9.51 billion in May, was primarily due to larger exports, which rose to a record level in June. 
 Still, the deficit with Japan widened, unnerving the currency markets and sending the dollar back to less than 100 yen. [Page D13.]
The 3.6 percent gain in overall exports, to $58.17 billion, helped offset a 2.8 percent increase in imports, to $67.54 billion. Nearly half the import increase was due to a record monthly purchase of foreign oil.
While the export statistics confirmed an increase in demand for American products, analysts said the rise in imports was additional evidence that the United States economy entered the second half of 1994 under a healthy head of steam.
 
Visions of a Robust Economy
 "These numbers only confirm the still-robust nature of the U.S. expansion," John Lipsky, chief economist at Salomon Brothers, said.
There was optimism, too, from Paul Mastroddi, a managing director at J. P. Morgan & Company, who said: "It is absolutely true that the United States is growing faster than the rest of the world. And all countries that are growing fast experience trade deterioration. But it is important to note that Europe and Japan are turning around. Every aspect of this report points to strong growth and a strengthening global economy."
With foreign economies showing increasing signs of recovery, the dollar weakening against major currencies and the chances increasing that the American economy would experience slower growth in the second half, analysts said the trade deficit was likely to narrow further over the next six months and beyond.
But that prospect did little to alter their predictions that for all of 1994, the American merchandise trade deficit would come close to equaling the record of $152.1 billion set in 1987.
"We will still have a record or near-record merchandise trade deficit," Mr. Lipsky said. "But relative to gross domestic product, the imbalances are moderate compared to what they were in the mid-1980's, because the domestic economy has been growing at a faster pace."
Despite the slight improvement in trade, the report showed that the United States' deficit with Japan widened in June by $1.13 billion, to $5.52 billion, the biggest monthly deficit since March. Imports from Japan totaled $10.08 billion, also the highest since March.
C. Michael Aho, senior international economist at Prudential Securities, said that the American deficit with Japan, calculated in yen, was already starting to improve. But because the effects of currency fluctuation on trade figures lag by 12 to 18 months, he said it would be some time before the Japanese trade surplus began to narrow in dollar terms.
"For the depreciating country, things get worse before they get better," Mr. Aho said.
While the United States ran its largest trade deficit with Japan, a number of other countries also continued to have very large surpluses with Washington.
China, which has been under pressure to liberalize its trading practices, recorded a $2.2 billion surplus with the United States in June, the Commerce Department said. And Canada and the countries of Western Europe had trade surpluses of more than $1 billion.
The increase in exports was led by sales of aircraft and telecommunications equipment.
Aside from oil imports, which rose to a record 249.29 million barrels, breaking the previous high of 230 million barrels in July 1993, imports of capital goods and automobiles recorded big gains in June.
But the pace of import growth is likely to slow, Mr. Lipsky of Salomon Brothers said, adding:
"We experienced such strong import growth in the second quarter that we do not feel the gains are going to be sustained. Over the next couple of quarters, import growth should be slower than growth for exports."

HEADLINE: A Brooklyn Woman Is Charged After the Death of Her Infant Son

BYLINE: By LYNETTE HOLLOWAY 

 BODY:
A Brooklyn mother was arrested yesterday morning and charged with endangering the welfare of a child after the death of her 19-month-old son, who had severe internal injuries, the police said.
The baby, Angel Cruz Jr., was pronounced dead at Wyckoff Hospital on Wednesday afternoon, said Sgt. John McCluskey, a police spokesman. While the cause of death has not been determined by the Medical Examiner's Office, the mother, Lisa Cruz, 24, of 1532 Gates Avenue in Bushwick, was arrested yesterday after undergoing hours of questioning by detectives at the 83d Precinct. 
 Mrs. Cruz, who is unemployed, told investigators she had left the baby with her boyfriend in her second-floor apartment.
 
Accusations of Neglect
 Mrs. Cruz's other children, Jamie, 5, and Angelica, 4, were taken away yesterday by workers from the Child Welfare Administration.
City officials would not comment on the family's situation, but family members and neighbors along Mrs. Cruz's rundown block said the two oldest children were taken away by child welfare workers about three years ago because of neglect. At that time, Angelica was taken to the hospital with a broken arm and leg, relatives said.
The children were returned to her home after Mrs. Cruz underwent two years of counseling, and she has been dedicated to her children since then, said her mother, Judy Santana, who lives down the hall in a dilapidated two-story, red brick building.
The baby had severe internal injuries and some bruises, Sergeant McCluskey said. Investigators said they did not know how the injuries occurred or whether they were inflicted by the mother.
Mrs. Cruz was charged with endangering the welfare of a child because of the nature of the injuries and because she was not with the child at the time, said Sgt. Edward Caro, another police spokesman. The boyfriend, whose name was not released, has not been charged, but he was questioned at length, the police said.
Before his death on Wednesday, Angel, a playful child with big brown eyes, could not stop crying, Mrs. Santana said. About 4 P.M. Mrs. Cruz's boyfriend fed him, changed his diapers and tried to put him to bed, the mother said. But he was still crying.
"The boyfriend ran down the hall in hysterics and asked me what he should do," said Mrs. Santana, who said the child had been sick with a virus about three weeks ago. "That's when I went over to see the baby. His stomach was swollen and hard and he was cold. I panicked and told him to call 911. I was so scared."

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
WOOLWORTH CORP. (Z,N)

BYLINE: Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The Woolworth Corporation said yesterday that its second-quarter loss widened because of a $30 million charge from the sale of Woolco stores in Canada and losses at discount stores in the United States and Germany.
For the second quarter, which ended on July 30, Woolworth recorded a loss of $42 million, or 32 cents a share, compared with a loss of $10 million, or 8 cents a share, for the corresponding quarter last year. 
 Wall Street had expected a loss of 2 cents a share, based on a survey of five analysts by Institutional Brokers Estimate System.
Woolworth said losses at its general merchandise and specialty operations narrowed because of the sale or closing of 1,112 discount stores in the United States and Canada. "The improvements, however, were offset by losses in other operations, primarily those in Germany, reflecting the weak economic conditions in that country," the company said.
Woolworth, based in New York, has been shedding less profitable operations to concentrate on specialty stores. The company posted a $495 million loss in fiscal 1994. On March 30, Woolworth said that it would restate quarterly results for the year that ended in January, citing accounting irregularities. The company later said the accounting problems did not affect its full-year financial results for fiscal 1994 and 1993.
For the second quarter, sales at the company's 7,472 specialty stores, including Foot Locker, Kinney, Northern Reflections and the Bargain Shop, rose 9.4 percent. Sales at Woolworth's 1,069 general merchandise stores declined 3.2 percent. Sales figures for both divisions exclude revenues from closed or sold stores.
Total sales declined 18 percent, to $1.88 billion from $2.29 billion. Sales outside of the United States fell 36 percent, while domestic sales fell 4.6 percent.

Year-ago 6 months' revenue included sales of $935 million from repositioned and Woolco stores.

HEADLINE: Feared Effect Of Rate Rise Drops Stocks

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Stocks fell yesterday for the first time in a week amid concern that the Federal Reserve's latest interest rate increases would slow the economy too much and hurt corporate profits.
The Fed "may have done more than slow the economy, and we may see significant slowing of earnings," said Hugh Johnson, chief investment strategist for the First Albany Corporation. 
 Higher rates are bad for stocks because they encourage people to put their money into fixed-rate investments that are perceived as less risky. They also slow the economy and raise the cost of borrowing, both of which hurt corporate profits.
 
Bond Yields Rise
 The decline in stocks accelerated as bonds slumped on worries that the Federal Reserve's five interest rate increases this year might not have prevented inflation from accelerating. The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 12/32 , to 1005/32 , for a yield of 7.49 percent.
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 21.05 points, to 3,755.43, hurt by losses in Caterpillar, General Motors and Boeing. The Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 2, to 463.17.
Auto stocks slumped amid concerns that higher rates would discourage consumers from buying new cars. General Motors fell 1 1/8, to 49 7/8; Ford Motor lost 1 1/8, to 29 1/2, and Chrysler dropped 1 1/8, to 47 1/4.
"Their stocks peak about a year and a half before earnings do," Richard Cripps, director of equity marketing at Legg Mason, said. "People now are looking over the mountain."
Shares of regional Bell telephone operating companies slipped a day after a long-distance provider, MCI Communications, asked Illinois regulators to establish new ground rules that would open up competition in local phone services.
Southwestern Bell fell 5/8, to 41 3/4; Ameritech slid3/4, to 41 5/8; Bell Atlantic dropped 1/2, to 55 5/8, and Pacific Telesis fell 3/4, to 31 7/8.
Shares of drug and health care companies fell, reversing gains from Wednesday, when American Cyanamid said it would accept a buyout offer of $101 a share from American Home Products. The S.& P. health care index, up 6.6 percent since Aug. 8, fell 5.48, to 363.14. Abbott Laboratories fell 7/8, to 30 1/4; Bristol-Myers Squibb declined 3/4, to 57 3/8, and Johnson & Johnson dropped 1 1/8, to 48 1/8. The Nasdaq composite index fell 0.49 point, to 742.17, after closing on Wednesday at its highest level since June 6. The decline was led by shares of Microsoft, Lotus Development and Intel.
Declining stocks outpaced advancers, 1,299 to 890, on the New York Stock Exchange, where 293.7 million shares were traded.
Select Media Communications, Cisco Systems, Lotus Development, Intel and American depository receipts of Telefonos de Mexico were the most active stocks on all the markets.
 
Lotus Earnings at Issue
 Lotus Development slid 47/16 , to 415/16 . Steven Frankel, an analyst with Adams, Harkness & Hill, cut his estimate of Lotus's third-quarter earnings to 37 cents a share from 44 cents.
Shares of Coca-Cola rose 1 1/2, to 47 5/8, after Warren E. Buffett, the investor and a Coca-Cola director, disclosed that he had bought 4.9 million shares of Coca-Cola last month. Mr. Buffett, whose investment decisions are closely watched on Wall Street, now owns 99.87 million shares, or about 7.75 percent, of Coke's shares outstanding.
Gupta fell 1 1/2, to 10 1/2, after Oracle ended discussions with the software maker concerning a potential business combination. Oracle, which rose 1/4, to 40 1/8, also said it had shed its holdings in the company.
Harley-Davidson added 1 7/8, to 54 1/2. The maker of motorcycles declared a 2-for-1 stock split, payable Sept. 12 to shareholders of record Aug. 29.

HEADLINE: Insurance Rollbacks Are Upheld

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT 

 BODY:
The California Supreme Court yesterday upheld an insurance reform measure passed by California voters in 1988 that required insurance companies to roll back auto insurance premiums and gave the state insurance commissioner broad powers to control prices and profits.
The ruling clears the way for the commissioner to order insurance companies to refund as much as $1 billion to millions of California auto insurance customers. The court decision, which was unanimous, also affirmed the authority of the commissioner to require the 700 insurance companies operating in the state to obtain approval for rate changes for all property and casualty insurance that includes homeowner policies. 
 Before the proposition was passed, California insurance companies were free to charge whatever rates the market would bear, with no approval required from regulators before raising rates.
 
 
Big Savings
 "Over time, this will save consumers in the state billions of dollars in premiums," said Harvey J. Rosenfield, an author of what was known as Proposition 103 in the state's 1988 election and an advocate of insurance reform. He credited the proposition for a slight decline in auto insurance rates since 1988, down from double digit increases in previous years.
Insurance companies fought the ballot measure bitterly in 1988 and in the courts after it was passed. In arguments before the state's Supreme Court, they said the proposition and the actions of the commissioner were illegal because they amounted to a confiscation of property and did not allow them to earn a fair return.
"This is a bad day for free enterprise," said Kim Brunner, a vice-president of State Farm Insurance, based in Bloomington, Ill. State Farm has disputed whether it owes a refund on auto insurance policies as called for by Proposition 103, and has a request pending with the commissioner for an 8.3 percent increase in homeowner insurance.
Mr. Brunner and insurance industry analysts said they were worried that the commissioner's authority to set rates at levels that limit the companies' profits would result in too little profit to grow and prosper. They said that the commissioner's profit target, equal to a 10 percent return on the company's capital, was too low. The commissioner used a 10 percent rate of return to calculate the refunds.
A superior court judge in Los Angeles last year agreed with most of the company's arguments, but in an appeal that went directly to the state's Supreme Court, the companies lost. The opinion by Justice Stanley Mosk said the insurance companies' property rights would be violated only in cases of "deep financial hardship," but noted that the insurance department had rules to consider special hardship cases.
So far, 29 of the 700 insurance companies doing business in California have paid $833 million of refunds, or an average of about $117 to each of more than six million policyholders. Of the 29, 10 companies were ordered by the commissioner to pay refunds and 19 volunteered.
Four more companies have been ordered by the commissioner to pay refunds, but have refused. The largest amount owed by any one of them is $235 million by State Farm, the state's largest insurer. Other large companies which have not yet paid refunds include USAA, Nationwide, Farmers Insurance and 20th Century. Among the 10 companies which paid refunds as ordered, payments averaged about 48 percent of the amounts initially requested by the commissioner.
In the case of 20th Century, which lost more than half of its capital in the Los Angeles earthquake early this year, state officials said they would negotiate a settlement of the $106 million it owes to policyholders so that the solvency of the company is not threatened by the refunds.
 
 
'Less Attractive Place'
 "I don't see the refunds as being a life-and-death issue for any companies in the state," said John Snyder, senior vice president at A. M. Best & Company, an insurance rating firm. "What I do worry about, however, is that the commissioner's authority to control not just insurance prices, but also insurance company profits, could make the state a much less attractive place to do business."
Although it has taken six years for the court to uphold Proposition 103's key provisions, its impact has already been felt in many parts of the country.
"The California vote was a psychological boost to reformers all over the country who were trying to stand-up to insurance companies," said Mr. Rosenfield, the insurance reform advocate. Insurance commissioners in 12 states are now elected, "so politically ambitious people can be elected to positions where they can make pro-consumer reforms," Mr. Rosenfield added.
 
 
A Bitter Commissioner
 John. Garamendi, the California insurance commissioner, gained much publicity and many enemies among insurance companies after he was elected in 1990 for his fight to collect refunds ordered by Proposition 103 and for his moves to protect homeowners hurt by brush fires in the state. Earlier this year, however, he was defeated in a bid for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination by Kathleen Brown, the State Treasurer. His term expires Jan. 2, and Mr. Garamendi said he would like a job in Washington, where his wife, Patricia, is a Peace Corps official.
With only five months remaining in office, Mr. Garamendi is bitter about the constant legal battle with insurance companies during his four-year term. He said the companies had spent $100 million in legal fees and called them "disingenuous and a bunch of liars" for their efforts to misrepresent his efforts.
For example, he noted that company warnings about the unfairness of regulations aimed at limiting profits to 10 percent of a company's capital are unfounded "because we have not made a decision" about the appropriate profit level. The profit target, he said, would depend on future developments, like the level of inflation.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Securities' Prices Sag

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities sagged yesterday, after the market was again reminded that although inflation may be out of sight, it is not out of mind.
Concerns about inflation were revived after the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia reported that prices paid by area manufacturers for raw materials surged to a five-year high in August. 
 The price of the 30-year bond fell 12/32 , to 1005/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from price, rose to 7.49 percent, from 7.39 percent on Wednesday. In the last two days, the bond market has given up nearly all the gains it posted Tuesday, when the Federal Reserve raised the discount rate and the Federal funds rate by a half-point each in an effort to keep a lid on inflation.
"I saw the day's market activity as an internal correction, using the Philly Fed report as an excuse," said Richard B. Hoey, chief economist for the Dreyfus Corporation. "The selloff was more technically driven than news driven."
The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, in its survey of 150 manufacturers in Pennsylvania, Delaware and southern New Jersey, said that its prices-received index rose to 24.5 in August from 15.8 in July, and its prices-paid index rose to 48.4 from 36.4.
 
Strong Economy Cited
 Some traders say that the economy is strong and that the increases in short-term rates have not been enough to slow it and may lead the Fed to tighten credit again. As long as the market continues to have expectations of another rate increase, bonds will not improve, analysts say.
"The long bond now appears to be headed to about 7.50 percent, its home base for the past few months," Mr. Hoey of Dreyfus said.
Also weighing on the market yesterday was a weaker dollar. In late New York trading, the dollar fell to 98.57 Japanese yen from 100.13 yen on Wednesday. It was the lowest level against the yen since Aug. 1. The dollar also fell against the German mark and other leading currencies. A weaker dollar makes it harder for foreign investors to hold onto Treasury securities, since a falling dollar diminshes their value.
Bond traders showed little reaction to two national economic reports yesterday. The Government said the trade gap narrowed 1.6 percent in June to $9.37 billion, as strong exports offset the fourth monthly record for merchandise imports. Economists had expected the deficit to be unchanged in the month.
The Government also reported jobless claims rose by 3,000 last week to 327,000. Economists had expected an increase of 1,000, to 322,000, with the four-month moving average the lowest since Dec. 25, 1993, when it fell to 319,500. The lackluster growth in claims supports the perception of an improving labor market, some economists said, with expectations of a strong job report for the month of August.
 
First Chicago Offering
 In the corporate market, the First Chicago Corporation sold $1 billion of triple-A rated securities backed by credit card loans through a special trust, with Salomon Brothers as the lead underwriter.
Half the issue, $500 million in floating-rate notes with an average life of 5.02 years, was priced to yield 18.75 basis points more than the one-month London interbank offered rate, which was about 4.81 percent late in the day. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
The remaining $500 million, consisting of fixed-rate notes with an average life of 5.02 years, was priced at $997.20 per $1,000 of notes to yield 7.322 percent.
At the Treasury's auction of $16.75 billion in new one-year bills yesterday, the average yield was 5.67 percent, up from 5.20 percent last month and the highest since July 25, 1991, when it was 5.88 percent.

Dollar Slides Against Yen As Japan Trade Gap Widens

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar tumbled about 1.5 percent against the Japanese yen yesterday, after a Government report showed that the United States trade deficit with Japan widened in June.
When the deficit expands, Japanese exporters find themselves with more dollars that they must sell for yen in order to bring their profits home, thus putting downward pressure on the United States currency. 
 "It has basically been a free fall," said Joe Francomano, a trader at Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank. "The market's falling as far as it wants to go."
The dollar also dropped, though not as steeply, against the German mark, after the Bundesbank left its interest rates unchanged. That leaves German rates higher than those in the United States, making mark-denominated investments relatively more attractive than those priced in dollars.
In late New York trading, the dollar fell to 98.57 yen, its lowest level since Aug. 1, from 100.13 yen on Wednesday. It also dropped to 1.5443 marks from 1.5512 marks.
The shortfall in American exports trade with Japan widened to $5.5 billion in June from $4.4 billion in May. The size of the trade deficit with Japan has been a primary reason for the dollar's 11 percent slide against the yen this year, traders said.
The increase in the trade deficit with Japan "keeps a lot of pressure on the dollar on the downside," said Koichi Takenaka, assistant vice president at Industrial Bank of Japan.
Concern about the deficit grew when Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown called the trade gap "way too high" yesterday. The dollar continued to slip, even after Mr. Brown said he was "hopeful" that the United States and Japan will reach an agreement in current talks aimed at increasing Japanese Government purchases of American goods.
The dollar fell against the mark after the Bundesbank left its repurchase rate unchanged at 4.85 percent. That is the rate the bank uses to signal changes in monetary policy, just as the Federal Reserve uses the Federal funds rate, an overnight lending rate. The Fed increased the funds rate to 4.75 percent from 4.25 percent on Tuesday.
Many analysts had thought that if the Bundesbank did not cut rates yesterday, it was unlikely to do so again until after Germany's federal elections in October.
"That led people to flock into the mark" at the dollar's expense, said Hugh Walsh, a trader at ING Capital Markets.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKET;
Concerns About Inflation Help to Raise Gold Prices

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Gold prices posted their largest one-day gains in nine weeks yesterday as the dollar's plunge made gold cheaper for foreign investors and as a report from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia raised concerns about inflation.
The dollar fell about 1.5 percent against the yen, after the Commerce Department said the United States trade deficit with Japan widened in June. A weaker dollar can lead investors to buy precious metals to protect against declines in dollar-denominated investments like bonds. 
 Also, the index of prices paid by manufacturers surged to a five-year high, the Philadelphia Fed reported in its survey of 150 manufacturers in Pennsylvania, Delaware and southern New Jersey.
The Philadelphia Fed report "means inflation is not going to go away very quickly," said Leonard Kaplan, vice president and chief trader with Imperial Bank in Los Angeles.
 
December Gold at $385.90
 Gold for December delivery, the most active futures contract, jumped $3.60, to $385.90 an ounce. That is its highest settlement since Aug. 1 on the Commodity Exchange in New York.
Other metals also gained. September silver rose 4.5 cents, to $5.162 an ounce on the Comex, while October platinum rose $4.70, to $416.30 an ounce on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Before yesterday's surge, gold had been trading at its lowest point since early May, languishing as demand for gold bullion from jewelers falls into a seasonal lull. That is expected to change soon as jewelry manufacturing picks up in the fall.
 
Oil Prices Tumble
 On other commodity markets, crude oil retreated and pork bellies rose. The Commodity Research Bureau's index rose 0.37 point,to 229.90.
Crude oil tumbled amid speculation that no supply shortages were emerging from the six-week strike by Nigerian oil workers. September crude fell 39 cents, to $17.72 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, its lowest point since May 25.
The United States, which obtained 10 percent of its imports from Nigeria before the strike, saw its overall supplies rise 1.1 percent last week because of a 15 percent rise in imports, especially from the North Sea.
And pork bellies rose as the hog slaughter slowed this week, which could temporarily reduce fresh belly supplies. February pork bellies rose 1.4 cents, to 43.1 cents a pound on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
"The last couple of days we haven't had as heavy a hog flow to the market," said Chuck Levitt, an analyst with the Alaron Trading Company in Chicago.

HEADLINE: Venezuela's Tight Grip Has Investors Gasping

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela, Aug. 12

 BODY:
Venezuela's largest foreign investor, a consortium led by the GTECorporation, is slashing by 40 percent its budget for upgrading the country's antiquated telephone system.
American Airlines is ending its daily flight from Caracas to New York next month, and is curtailing two other flights, to Miami and San Juan, P.R., effectively cutting its service by nearly half. 
Buffeted by a severe recession and burdensome new economic controls, Venezuela, once one of the region's hot investment markets, is quickly losing its sparkle. Even now, it remains the United States' third-largest Latin American destination for exports and investment, after Mexico and Brazil, and the United States' second-largest source of oil, after Saudi Arabia.
In the short term, Venezuela is enduring what is expected to be the worst economic performance of any South American country this year. Eleven Venezuelan banks, responsible for half of all domestic deposits, have failed so far this year because of poor practices and a lack of Government supervision. Economists predict that by the end of the year, Venezuela's imports will have dropped in half, inflation will have nearly doubled and economic activity will have shrunk by 8 percent.
But beyond this slump, investors worry about Venezuela's future under its new President, Rafael Caldera, a 78-year-old populist with an authoritarian streak. Since he took office in February, Mr. Caldera has reversed free-market policies implanted here only a few years ago, and has slapped so many controls on the economy that the Government's discretionary power over business ranks behind only that of Cuba in the region.
In late June, the Government imposed controls on all foreign currency transactions and on hundreds of prices. To combat "hoarding," President Caldera also decreed that the Government could seize private property without compensation.
"The Government's response to the country's severe banking and exchange-rate crisis has only made matters worse," said Francis Freisinger, Venezuela analyst for the Economist Intelligence Unit, a London-based group. He said Venezuela's creditworthiness had taken a beating.
The impact has been felt not just by Venezuelans but also by foreign investors. "American businessmen are very disillusioned, particularly American businessmen who were planning to use Venezuela as a regional base," said an American diplomat who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "But more important, new American investment is not going to come."
Fabian Ponce Alban, American Airlines' country director, attributed the cutbacks in the airline's service to Venezuela's recession and its imposition of new foreign-exchange controls. "We are expanding everywhere else in South America," Mr. Ponce said.
The Venezuelan-American Chamber of Commerce and Industry, long a cheery booster for more foreign investment, has fallen silent. "We are not promoting investment," said Antonio A. Herrera-Vaillant, the chamber's general manager. "It's a catastrophe on every front."
Even Conapri, a semiprivate Venezuelan council that promotes investment, said in a recent bulletin that the Government's new system of currency controls "has made doing business extremely difficult in Venezuela."
To Government officials, the measures are temporary and are justified by the nation's financial emergency. Venezuela's shaky insurance industry has come under close watch since Aug. 5, when a group of banks rescued the nation's largest insurance company, Seguros La Seguridad, from collapse.
"These control measures were not taken for ideological reasons, but for reasons of necessity," said Fernando Luis Egana, a presidential aide. "Venezuelan laws don't foresee the emergency situation we are living through."
The most obvious catastrophe has been the suspension of foreign currency trading. To stop a flight of capital, Venezuelan officials forced one of Latin America's most import-dependent economies onto a radical dollar diet.
All decisions on the foreign-exchange needs of a $60 billion annual economy are now centralized in a five-member Exchange Administration Board. Aware that Venezuela's last experience with exchange controls, in the mid-1980's, led to the theft of billions of dollars by Government officials in collusion with businessmen, the new board believes it can insure honesty only by personally approving each request.
In the first seven weeks of the new system, only $80 million of requests were approved. As of Aug. 11, the board had approved just 40 out of a reported 120,000 foreign currency requests. How many dollars are actually flowing is unclear.
Until the exchange controls were imposed, Venezuela was importing $22 million worth of goods a day.
"Nobody has gotten a dollar," Mr. Herrera-Vaillant reported after polling a directors' meeting of the Venezuelan-American chamber. "The port is paralyzed. There are no rules to the game."
With Government officials determined to maintain controls for at least another six months, the drought of dollars is rippling through the economy.
The Venezuela subsidiaries of Ford, General Motors and Chrysler gave their employees Christmas vacations in July for lack of work. Chrysler de Venezuela is delaying the start of a $12 million expansion until the economic picture clears.
"If they don't give us foreign exchange as soon as possible, the entire auto parts industry will stop in the next two weeks," Jose Luis Hernandez, a director of the national association for auto parts producers. The industry, which he said normally imported $400 million worth of materials a year, had not received any dollars for six weeks.
Jacinto Marin, president of a national truckers group, warned recently that without imported tires and spare parts, trucking might gradually slow throughout Venezuela.
In a country that imports 70 percent of its food, the exchange controls are expected to start causing food shortages next month. Living off its oil wealth, Venezuela neglected its agriculture for decades. As the only Andean nation that is not self-sufficient in coffee, it planned to import 500 tons of coffee this year.
"Both price and exchange controls have created a very difficult situation for us," said the general manager of one American processed food company here. "We spend hours meeting with Government functionaries to discuss whether we can raise this or that product by 10 cents. So far, I don't think any big producer in the processed foods sector has received foreign exchange."
With the Government enjoying such enormous discretionary power, few American business people want to stick their necks out by talking to reporters. Of 10 American manufacturing and banking executives reached this week, only two agreed to talk, both on the condition that names not be used.
"We have only one month of raw materials left in the pipeline -- labels, bottles, boxes, ingredients," said the manager of one American pharmaceutical company. "After two months of no imports, you miss one or two ingredients and production starts to fall off the track."
 
 
No Crowds for Breakfast
 The impact of dwindling investment can be seen at the largely deserted executive breakfast buffet at the Caracas Hilton, a high-rise lounge that used to fill daily with foreign and Venezuelan executives.
"We just lost 3,000 room nights with a Latin American cellular telephone convention that has been postponed," Peter Schaepe, the hotel's general manager, said.
With its annual per capita income of $3,100 among the highest in Latin America, Venezuela has long been the largest foreign trading partner for the state of Florida. But this year Florida expects to see its exports to Venezuela fall to half of last year's level, $3.2 billion.
Neighboring Colombia, a comparatively poor nation, recently opened an $80 million credit line to Venezuela to keep bilateral trade flowing. Venezuelan companies now owe Colombian exporters $200 million.
Reviewing the exchange control debacle, the Economist Intelligence Unit has reduced Venezuela's credit risk rating to 75, South America's worst. Venezuela's credit risk, which ranked with Mexico's when Mr. Caldera took office, has dropped to the level of Algeria's and Nigeria's. Moody's and Standard & Poor's have also cut their ratings on Venezuela's foreign currency debt.
American investors describe as particularly sobering the experience of GTE, which manages the largest investment in Venezuela's private sector. The star among new American companies attracted by free-market policies adopted after 1989, GTE led the privatization of Venezuela's state-run telephone system, Cantv, in late 1991. The consortium also includes AT&T and Telefonica of Spain.
 
 
Unpaid Phone Bills
 Promising first-world telephone service to Venezuelans long abused by crackling lines and dead telephones, GTE announced an eight-year, $6 billion investment program. In the last two years, GTE more than doubled the number of public telephones and increased the number of telephone lines by almost 50 percent.
But successive governments let their unpaid telephone bills balloon to $250 million. Partly because of this, Cantv borrowed heavily from foreign banks to meet its capital spending targets. On Aug. 1, Cantv failed to meet a payment on a $40 million loan because the Exchange Control Board refused to grant it dollars.
Cantv has threatened to cut off telephone service to eight Government ministries, starting on Aug. 19. In response, aides to President Caldera have hinted that future access to dollars may be tied to forgiveness of the Government's telephone debt.
In such an environment, Cantv is cutting $600 million off a 1994-95 capital budget of $1.5 billion.
"The Government now faces an uphill battle to regain the trust of the international community," said Mr. Freisinger of the Economist Intelligence Unit.

HEADLINE: New Claims By Jobless Up

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 18

 BODY:
The number of Americans filing new unemployment claims last week rose to the highest level since the end of July, the Labor Department said today.
Initial weekly unemployment claims increased 3,000, to 327,000. The results show labor markets have stabilized after seasonal manufacturing layoffs and floods in Georgia caused first-time claims numbers to bounce up and down in July. 
 "The numbers are sustaining the improvement we have seen in the payroll numbers over the past couple of months," said David Cohen, an economist with MMS International in San Francisco.
The four-week moving average for jobless claims, a less volatile gauge of employment conditions, fell to 323,750 last week, from 339,500, the lowest level since the end of 1993.
"This really doesn't display any new trends in terms of labor market conditions; however, if the four-week moving average continues to fall over the next couple months, it might be a red flag to the Federal Reserve," said Kevin Flanagan, an economist with Dean Witter Reynolds in New York.
On Tuesday, the Fed raised interest rates for the fifth time this year in an effort to contain inflation spurred by the expanding economy.

HEADLINE: Cuomo Pledges 2d Installment Of Tax Cuts In the Future

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Aug. 18

 BODY:
In a campaign in which tax cuts have emerged as both a promise and a political weapon, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo today pledged a second installment in the cuts enacted this year, saying he wants to reduce the state tax burden as much as $1.5 billion more over several years.
The announcement was the latest in a series of dueling tax cut promises from the three men running for Governor. Mr. Cuomo's two Republican rivals today portrayed his proposal -- which contained no specifics and was essentially a pledge to develop a plan -- as hollow electioneering. His main rival, George E. Pataki again used the opportunity to attack Mr. Cuomo over the state's tax rate, though he himself has released only the barest details of his own plans. 
 Mr. Cuomo went to great lengths to say the announcement was unrelated to the campaign, and aides said it grew from a study of the tax system he ordered in January. But in a statement, Mr. Cuomo said his plan would be "a cornerstone of my legislative program for my next term should I have the good fortune of continuing to serve this great state."
In his announcement, he set a tax-cutting goal during several years of $1 billion to $1.5 billion and directed his staff to develop "a multiyear blueprint" to be released before Election Day. That is in addition to the $475 million in tax cuts enacted by the Governor and Legislature this year, a cut that will grow to an annual maximum of $1.6 billion in 1997.
"Will we be able to afford it?" the Governor asked at a news conference in Manhattan. "Yes, of course, you'll be able to afford it as long as the economy is growing. If the economy doesn't grow, then the place dies anyway."
 
Questioned on Specifics

 But affordability was hardly the issue for the other two candidates, Mr. Pataki and Richard M. Rosenbaum, the former state Republican chairman who has proposed cutting the personal income tax by 24 percent and slashing state spending $4 billion a year.
They criticized Mr. Cuomo for what they said was a poor record holding down taxes and questioned the lack of specifics in the plan.
"Why should anyone believe he would enact such an agenda in the fourth term?" asked Lisa Linden, Mr. Rosenbaum's spokeswoman. "An empty proposal like this certainly offers no reassurance to the voters."
Caroline Quartararo, Mr. Pataki's press secretary, said Mr. Pataki intended to release his own tax-cutting plan soon. So far, he has proposed a further reduction in the personal income tax and a cut in the alternate minimum income tax, lowering capital gains taxes and immediately abolishing the corporate surcharge tax, though he has specified few details and has not outlined how he would pay for the cuts. He voted against spending increases eight times in the 10 years he was in the Legislature.
Ms. Quartararo said Mr. Cuomo's announcement smacked of "political opportunism."
"Can we believe him?" she asked. "I don't think so."
Thomas Conroy, a spokesman for Mr. Cuomo, said the announcement was released along with a new study of the state's tax system, which Mr. Cuomo ordered in January from the Department of Taxation and Finance as he proposed tax cuts in this year's budget. At the time, the Republicans who control the Senate said the cuts were too low, and by the end of the Legislative session, the reductions were more than doubled.
 
New York Ranks 22d
 New York State ranks 22d in the nation in state tax burden. Mr. Cuomo said today that his goal was to drop that ranking to the lowest third of states.
Mr. Conroy said such a drop would be consistent with Mr. Cuomo's record: the state burden has dropped from 13th in the nation when he took office. Opponents, however, argue that the state has shifted much of the burden to local governments, and they point out that when state and local taxes are combined, New York ranks second only to Alaska in tax burden. Overall, statistics show that the entire tax burden, state and local, has remained relatively consistent during Mr. Cuomo's tenure.
In his proposal, Mr. Cuomo laid out three conditions for any cuts: "You cannot do it by savaging essential services," he said. "You cannot do it by putting the burden on Mayor Giuliani and local governments. Third, it has to be done fairly. You should have the people who can afford to pay taxes pay taxes. The people who can't shouldn't and the people who can afford less should pay less."
For the first time in years, Mr. Cuomo expressed a willingness to cut further the personal income tax, which has dropped to the current top rate of 7.875 percent from 10 percent in 1985. The top tax was scheduled by law to drop to 7 percent in 1990, but that reduction was deferred because of the recession, and since then Mr. Cuomo has expressed reservations about a further cut.
"We can cut further," he said today. He added that the current schedule for reducing the personal income tax was faulty, in that it would have increased taxes for some law-income earners.
Without further details, it was impossible to gauge how a reduction of another $1.5 billion would affect individual taxpayers or businesses. Last week, the Business Council of New York State released a report saying that the state would have to cut taxes an additional $2.3 billion, in addition to the cuts made this year, to make up for economic activity lost since the recession.

HEADLINE: Home Video

BYLINE: By Peter M. Nichols 

 BODY:
Tapes are renting as strongly as ever this summer, but other formats are pushing ahead, too. Take video on demand, the term for the instant delivery of any title at any time by various carriers, including telephone companies. That level of service is many years away at best, but for early tests Bell Atlantic and the other so-called regional Baby Bells are beginning to stock up on movies and other titles from Hollywood studios.
Unlike cable operators, telephone companies have no ready-made pool of programming and need to build a supply of titles from scratch. "We're looking for tens of thousands," said Bob Townsend, the president for interactive multimedia products in Bell Atlantic's video-services division. 
 But video on demand doesn't yet faze the home-video industry, which is breaking ground of its own. One new area is CD-ROM, and distributors are starting to adapt the disk format to some of the same kinds of promotions they profit from on tape.
For instance, on Sept. 14, Turner plans to release the CD-ROM "The People v. O. J. Simpson: An Interactive Companion to the O. J. Simpson Trial," which is to begin four days later. The disk, which will be available for both I.B.M. and Macintosh platforms, is perhaps home video's (or anybody else's) first interactive instant publishing title.
The CD-ROM, which will cost under $20, draws from a voluminous Simpson file compiled by CNN, the news network owned by Turner. An hour of full-motion video drawn from CNN broadcasts is included, along with reams of testimony and information about evidence, strategy and other aspects of the case. In addition, purchasers will have access to Compuserve's daily on-line coverage of the trial.
Some news accounts describe the disk as a kind of video game in which the object is to reach a verdict. Stuart Snyder, the executive vice president of Turner Home Entertainment, said he strongly disagreed and called the title nothing more or less than a reference work for those who are following the case. "It's a companion piece," he said.
Like Turner, other video distributors are finding different applications for CD-ROM's. In October, Image Entertainment, a laser-disk company, plans to release "The Terminator," the first of a series of movies on CD-ROM (among them "Dances With Wolves" and "The Silence of the Lambs"), also available for both I.B.M. and Macintosh.
For various technical reasons, movies played on computers can use only a quarter of the screen and proceed at a rate of 15 frames a second, which results in quality inferior to videotape. That might seem an odd comedown for a distributor of laser disks, which provide by far the sharpest video images available. But Martin Greenwald, the chairman of Image Entertainment, said that with 30 million personal computers in use (as opposed to about 1.5 million laser disk players), CD-ROM's can't be ignored.
For now, quality doesn't concern Mr. Greenwald. "What's important is that it's passable," he said, adding that quality will eventually improve. The immediate goal is introduce movies to the format.
Besides, the price is right: as low as $10.
 
NEW VIDEO RELEASES
 
Four Weddings and a Funeral
1994. Polygram. $95.99. Laser disk, $39.99. 116 minutes. Closed captioned. R. Release date: Wednesday.
 Continually on call as an attractive best man, Charles (Hugh Grant) makes his way between nuptials, with one death intervening, in a long round of socializing with friends and acquaintances. Mike Newell's film could have gone nowhere from there, but funny material and charming performances by Mr. Grant and a fine supporting cast find a fresh way across familiar ground. Only Andie MacDowell as a hard-boiled American doesn't fit into a deft English comedy with, Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times, "a light, engaging style that is very much its own."
 
The House of the Spirits
1994. LIVE. $94.98. 132 minutes. Closed captioned. R.
Bille August's film never reaches for the complexity or mysticism of Isabel Allende's novel, but it does take chances of its own with the story of a South American family caught in political upheaval. Heading a cast capable of just about anything are Jeremy Irons as the cold, conservative estate owner, Meryl Streep as the woman he marries, Glenn Close as his repressed sister, Winona Ryder as his rebellious daughter and Vanessa Redgrave as Ms. Streep's mother. Mr. August's style is naturally severe, but here he adds fanciful touches to a "cool, ravishing film filled with odd gaps and understated miracles" (Maslin).
 
I'll Do Anything
1994. Columbia Tri-Star. $95.51. 116 minutes. Closed captioned. PG-13.
Originally intended as a musical, James L. Brooks's film does best as a satire of Hollywood at its most boorish, particularly in the person of the arrogant director Burke Adler (Albert Brooks). Nick Nolte is an unemployed actor who has the misfortune of working for Adler as a chauffeur, and Whittni Wright is the actor's 6-year-old studio-wise daughter, spectacularly hip to the manipulative ways of the movie business. Though the father-daughter relationship never develops, bubbling through are "some wonderfully satirical ingredients, touches that are no less scathingly hilarious than anything in 'The Player' " (Maslin).
 
Knife in the Head
1980. New Yorker. $79.95. 108 minutes. German with English subtitles. No rating.
In Reinhard Hauff's stark study of sociopolitical currents in West Germany, Bertolt Hoffmann (Bruno Ganz) goes to find his estranged wife, who is living with her leftist lover, and is critically injured in a skirmish with the police. Left to cope with severe brain injuries, Bertolt tries to get a fix on his life in a story that becomes part metaphysical mystery story and part denunciation of the German right and left. Though Mr. Hauff lacks the flair of a Rainer Werner Fassbinder, say, he directs with methodical command, and Mr. Ganz shows a "film presence that finds power even in utter passivity" (Vincent Canby).
 
KEEP IN MIND
 
Favorites, From 'Philadelphia'
To 'In the Name of the Father'

HEADLINE: Mr. Clinton: Defend Your Trade Pledge

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration fought for consumers when it signed a trade accord in April with more than 100 other countries in Marrakesh, Morocco. But it besmirched its record when it sent Congress implementing legislation that contradicted the Marrakesh accord in dozens of places. It was as if the Commerce Department had decided to protect powerful corporate friends in steel, textiles and cement rather than consumers or the vast number of U.S. companies that need to buy low-cost foreign goods.
Then House and Senate committees took the Administration's draft and made it worse. Conferees will meet soon to hammer out final language -- providing a chance to fix the wrongs. 
 At issue are anti-dumping statutes, which require foreigners to sell in the U.S. at fair prices; foreign companies may not sell at prices either below what they charge in their home country or below their cost of production. But the U.S. and other countries manipulate anti-dumping laws to shut out imports that are not dumped. The Marrakesh accord tries to limit this protectionist practice.
The accord says that the U.S. must make a fair comparison between prices here and abroad. But the Senate committee, at the insistence of Ernest Hollings of South Carolina, proposes a formula that, by treating profit differently here and abroad, would artificially deflate the calculation of prices some foreign businesses charge in the U.S. -- and make conviction for dumping near-certain.
The accord also recognizes that production costs typically decline for new companies during a break-in period; the U.S. is supposed to calculate a foreign company's costs at the end of the break-in period. But the Administration and Congressional committees propose making such costs appear high by using an earlier period.
The Marrakesh accord allows countries to retaliate only if domestic industry has been harmed. To show harm, the U.S. would have to demonstrate substantial imports compared with the size of domestic production. House and Senate committees, with Administration support, propose to make U.S. production look small -- and dumping look harmful -- by ignoring a substantial part of U.S. output, known as captive production. Captive production refers to goods made not for sale but for use in other goods -- a computer business's production of semiconductors, for example.
In Marrakesh, the Administration stood for open trade and economic growth. At home, it proposed sizable doses of protectionism. The conferees will now decide which version of U.S. policy will be the final version.

HEADLINE: Before We Wreck the Health System . . .

SERIES: HEALTH CARE SECOND OPINIONS -- An occasional series.

BYLINE: By Ross Perot; Ross Perot, independent candidate for President in 1992, is author of "United We Stand: How We Can Take Back Our Country."

DATELINE: DALLAS

 BODY:
America's health care system the world's finest -- consists of tens of millions of very complex parts. It took nine years and $300 million, for example, just to develop and test Mevacor, the pill that reduces cholesterol. And that is but one tiny part of the health care industry.
The health industry is twice the size of the U.S. auto industry. It is 14 percent of our economy. It affects every American from birth to death. Successfully reshaping health care is far more complicated than building an aircraft carrier or designing the space shuttle or inventing the atomic bomb. 
 The Clinton Administration's health care plan was drafted in secret by talented, well-intentioned group whose leaders had little experience in health care. This plan did not attract widespread support in Congress, or with the American people.
 Now the Clinton plan is being hurriedly redrafted into a variety of new bills by Congressional staffers who have little experience with health care. Most of these bills include a vast new Government bureaucracy to oversee the health system. Senate leaders are rushing to force a vote in the next few days on bills that have not been read. Moreover, this restructuring has been undertaken along partisan lines. The American people have been subjected to propaganda and emotional anecdotes instead of having these "reforms" explained to them in a logical and rational manner.
Worse yet, no one can accurately estimate what these bills will cost American taxpayers. We do know that the costs will be massive. In 1965, Congress thought the new Medicare program would cost $9 billion a year by 1990. The actual cost of Medicare in 1990 was $110 billion! With our $4.6 trillion debt, we can no longer afford to make such mistakes.
 Can the Government effectively manage health care for the entire nation? Consider the nationwide health care program it manages now -- our veterans' hospitals, where services are so poor that only 10 percent of veterans make use of this system.
But there is a rational way to improve the health system, deliver care to the uninsured and keep costs in line.
First, identify the parts of the system that need to be improved. Bring in leading authorities to design the improvements. When this detailed plan has been completed, explain the system carefully to the American people in plain language. Skip the propaganda.
 Once a consensus is reached, carefully figure out the cost of these changes and frankly explain how health care will be paid for. Don't mislead the American people by claiming "companies will pay for it" and implying that health care will be free -- indeed, it will be the ultimate hidden tax on the ordinary American, because companies will simply increase their prices and consumers will wind up paying the entire cost.
 Finally, conduct pilot programs to make sure these improvements work as planned and their costs can be determined. The logical pilot group would include every member of Congress, every member of the White House staff and every Federal employee.
Testing a Government-run program on Government employees shouldn't impose much of a hardship. They already have an excellent health benefits program, so they should have good ideas about the operation of a nationwide system. This would guarantee every citizen that any health care plan would be debugged, optimized and trouble-free before it is imposed on the entire nation.
Once the pilot operation is working successfully, at a cost we can afford, with the American people fully informed of the plan and its costs, the decision to make changes nationwide can be made with all the facts on the table and at minimal risk. Compare this rational approach with the propaganda, emotional appeals and name calling in Washington today.
Obviously, no one wants rationing of health services and waits of up to 18 months for surgical procedures, items that are prevalent in Government-run health programs in Europe, Canada and our own veterans' hospitals.
 Democrats and Republicans must work together to carefully design, test and price the new health system. Encourage them to go slow, take their time, get it right. What's the hurry?
 Let's not destroy health care in a well-intentioned effort to save it. Remember, the first rule of medicine is "do no harm." The process I have described could take two years or more. It took nine years to develop Mevacor, just one pill. This is a process that we cannot short-circuit if we want a cost-effective health system that truly benefits the American people. In the words of the carpenter, "measure twice, cut once."

HEADLINE: FLIGHT FROM CUBA: THE OVERVIEW;
U.S., IN NEW POLICY, INTENDS TO DETAIN CUBAN IMMIGRANTS

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 18

 BODY:
With hundreds of Cubans continuing to flee each day in rafts and rubber dinghies, the Clinton Administration announced tonight, in a sharp change of policy, that it would detain Cubans for an indefinite period after they arrived in the United States.
The move, effective immediately, is a major departure from an open-door policy toward Cubans, who, for three decades, have usually been granted free entry into the United States after a brief interview by immigration authorities. 
 Attorney General Janet Reno announced the new policy at an unusual late-night news conference, saying the move was intended to slow the fast-growing flow of refugees from Cuba to the United States, which Ms. Reno ascribed to deep dissatisfaction with the Government of Fidel Castro.
The announcement came just hours after President Clinton rebuffed a plea from the Governor of Florida to declare a state of emergency there in response to the wave of Cuban refugees.
The abrupt nature of Ms. Reno's announcement appeared to be intended to comfort the many Florida residents who say that President Clinton was too quick to reject the plea from Gov. Lawton Chiles for millions of dollars in Federal aid to deal with the more than 2,000 Cubans who have reached Florida this month.
In her four-minute appearance at 10:40 P.M. at the White House, Ms. Reno said the new detention policy would be undertaken to insure that the Administration was doing what it could "to discourage people from risking their lives."
"It is an unsafe trip," she added. "We are trying to discourage people from coming from Cuba."
Governor Chiles said he was pleased by the Administration's switch in policy. "This keeps Castro from being able to call the shots," he said in an interview on CNN.
Governor Chiles added, "It's a day that I'm delighted is here."
President Clinton has scheduled a news conference for 1:30 P.M. on Friday, and the Cuba decision is expected to be formally announced then.
Governor Chiles said: "I'm looking forward to the President's announcement tomorrow. I'm trusting, because I had a conversation with him today, that this is going to be a further good, firm statement."
Mr. Chiles added, "We are not going to allow Castro to dictate our immigration policy."
Earlier in the day, Administration officials said they were searching for a policy that would stop Cubans from fleeing in flimsy vessels, an exodus that officials said had caused dozens of Cubans to drown this month.
Under the new policy, the Cubans will be held indefinitely in Federal installations, including units run by the Immigration and Naturalization Service. That is a sharp change from the previous policy, under which many Cuban refugees were turned over to relatives within hours after the Coast Guard picked them up in at sea and brought them ashore in Florida.
The policy announced tonight was less drastic than another proposal that Administration officials said they had been considering: turning back some of the Cuban refugees instead of continuing the longstanding policy of granting virtually all Cubans entry. Another option that was considered was to transfer Cuban refugees to third countries or safe havens -- a policy similar to the one adopted to handle the flood of Haitian immigrants this summer.
Administration officials acknowledged that both those options would be likely to anger many Cuban-Americans, and they hoped that those people, worried about the drownings of their countrymen, would be more sympathetic to a policy of detentions.
For the Administration, one advantage of the new policy is that it can easily be reversed if Cuban-Americans attack it. Administration officials said tonight that they had adopted the new policy only after consulting with Cuban-American groups.
In resisting the plea of Governor Chiles to declare a state of emergency in Florida, President Clinton finds himself torn between domestic politics and foreign policy imperatives.
On one hand, the President wants to help Governor Chiles, a fellow Southern Democrat who faces a tough re-election race this November, possibly against former President George Bush's son Jeb.
In a midterm election year when the Democrats fear major reversals, especially in the larger, more influential states, one of the last things the Administration wants is to lose the Governor's Mansion in Florida, the fourth most populous state, which has 25 electoral votes.
With an eye on November, Mr. Chiles is insisting that the Administration declare a state of emergency, partly to show Florida voters that he has clout in Washington. He is also asking for $75 million in emergency Federal financing to counter Republican charges that he is spending too much on social services for immigrants and others.
But diplomatic concerns are giving President Clinton a strong tug in the other direction. Administration officials said today that they were reluctant to declare a full-scale emergency because it would send a signal to Cubans that the door was open wide for them to flee in their boats and rafts. At the same time, declaring an emergency would tell Fidel Castro, the Cuban leader, that he had succeeded in unnerving the Administration.
 
Emergency Meeting
 After an emergency high-level White House meeting on the Cuba situation today, Administration officials said they were considering numerous contingency plans. These included increasing the number of Coast Guard vessels off Cuba and enabling more Cubans to gain refugee status by applying in Havana, rather than by taking to rafts. The Coast Guard now has a dozen cutters and 31 small boats patrolling the Florida Straits.
Pentagon officials said Navy personnel were trucking tents from Gulfport, Miss., to Homestead Air Force Base in Florida in case the wave of Cubans surged suddenly.
Administration officials say wretched economic conditions in Cuba are the underlying factor behind the exodus, but they add that the immediate reason for it is that Mr. Castro has stopped prohibiting Cubans from fleeing in rafts, inner tubes and small boats.
According to Administration policymakers, Mr. Castro has permitted the recent wave of refugees in the hope that it would vex the Administration and pressure it to ease its trade embargo against Cuba. That would enable Cubans and Mr. Castro to breathe more easily at a time when the Cuban leader faces the most domestic dissent in years.
Senior American officials said today they had ruled out relaxing the embargo, which Mr. Castro asserts is destroying Cuba's economy and causing the wave of refugees.
In a news conference today in Key West, where the Coast Guard has taken most of the Cuban refugees, Governor Chiles declared an emergency situation within his state. He said the Florida National Guard, marine patrol and other branches of government would be used to respond to the influx of Cubans.
"These large numbers create an emergency situation for services and assistance," Governor Chiles said. "Already, this emergency creates a burden on local and state resources."
At a news conference, Ms. Reno treated Mr. Chiles's depiction of the situation as an exaggeration, saying the Administration was handling the problem "in an orderly way and without disruption." She said the Immigration and Naturalization Service was adding more than a dozen workers in Florida to handle the Cuban refugees.
"We do not believe that this current influx has been a burden yet on the community," she said. To buttress this point, she noted that 75 percent of the Cuban refugees who have arrived this year had been settled with relatives in Florida and 15 percent with relatives in other states, primarily New York and New Jersey. The other 10 percent, she said, have also been placed outside of Florida.
But Administration officials said they were analyzing the situation day to day and would not rule out putting an emergency plan into effect.
"'We're watching it very closely, but to date we've been able to manage the situation and we expect we'll continue to be able to," said Dee Dee Myers, the White House Press Secretary.
 
Would Bar Mariel Repeat
 Administration officials vow not to allow a replay of the Mariel exodus, in which an estimated 90 percent of the refugees were carried by boats belonging to Cuban-Americans from Florida.
The Coast Guard has been ordered to increase patrols to stop and seize boats heading to Cuba from Florida to pick up refugees.
"We are not going to permit another massive exodus," said Ms. Myers. "We will not allow Fidel Castro to dictate our immigration policy."
One senior State Department official said he doubted that the flow of Cubans would grow to the same proportions as the wave of Haitians did last June. Since Cuba does not have free enterprise, he said, it is harder for Cubans to build medium-sized boats to carry lots of refugees. That is why Haitian refugees often fled 50 or 100 to a boat, while the Cubans flee 5 or 10 to a raft.
Attorney General Reno seized on the new exodus to indict Mr. Castro. "To divert the Cuban people from seeking democratic change, the government of Cuba has resorted to the unconscionable tactic of letting people risk their lives by leaving in flimsy vessels through the treacherous waters of the Florida Straits," she said.
"An uncontrolled exodus from Cuba will do nothing to address Cuba's internal problems. The solution to Cuba's problems is rapid, fundamental and far-reaching political and economic reform."

HEADLINE: Russia Treasures Plutonium, But U.S. Wants to Destroy It

SERIES: After the Arms Race -- Second of three articles.

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD with MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW

 BODY:
To the Americans it is an albatross, an economic liability and a threat to global security that must be rendered untouchable or destroyed. But to the Russians it is, as one official put it, "a national treasure," to be husbanded now and to produce boundless energy for future generations.
The object of these clashing views is prime, bomb-grade plutonium, produced during the cold war by each side at enormous cost in money, health and environmental damage. With the arms race winding down, huge stocks of plutonium are coming out of bombs -- during the next decade at least 50 tons each in the United States and Russia, American officials say. In Russia, that comes on top of plutonium stocks accumulated for use in power plants. 
 But now, as the United States searches for a safe way to get rid of plutonium, Russia not only wants to save the material being taken from weapons but also to make still more in the quest for energy.
The country is planning a new generation of nuclear power plants called breeders that create more plutonium than the nuclear fuel they consume. And that plutonium, while not as pure as that from weapons, would still be readily usable by a bomb-maker.
What is more, senior Russian officials say they plan to pay for these costly factories in part with dollars from the United States Government, money that that the Ministry of Atomic Energy here will earn from an unprecedented contract to sell America still another bomb fuel, highly enriched uranium. The United States has contracted to buy about 500 metric tons of highly enriched uranium -- which Russia had prepared for weapons use -- during the next 20 years for a total of about $10 billion dollars. The Russians will dilute the uranium so that the United States can burn it in civilian reactors for energy, but the real American purpose was to reduce the chances of theft or sales on the world market, a goal that could be undercut by the Russians' use of the revenues to build breeder reactors.
Thus while the cold war may be over, the gulf in attitudes about its nuclear legacy could hardly be larger. And the Russian approach, Americans fear, will add to the long-term security risk. Russia will keep its surplus weapons plutonium in a pure form, the form in which it is used in weapons, thus making it attractive to terrorists or nations that want a bomb; as little as four kilograms, or less than 10 pounds, a chunk smaller than a fist, would be enough. And Russia's planned breeder reactors would produce more weapons-usable plutonium, slightly less pure but also readily usable in bombs.
Even without thefts, the more plutonium that remains in an easily accessible form in either country, the easier it would be for a future Russian or American government to rebuild a giant nuclear arsenal in a short time. While American officials say their own stockpiles are safely guarded for now, they argue that disposal of plutonium now could help protect future generations.
The United States, which first synthesized plutonium and has spent billions of dollars and created substantial damage to the environment and human health in the process, is ready to dispose of it. That process is a costly and difficult enterprise in it own right, and will be pursued with none of the sense of national mission that attended its manufacture.
"Plutonium has essentially a negative economic value," said John Gibbons, the White House science adviser, stressing that even using already available plutonium as fuel in reactors would cost far more than using uranium. The United States argues that uranium, cheap now, will stay that way for decades.
 
'Global Security Risk'
 "The plutonium we no longer need for weapons is a global security risk and an economic liability," said Hazel R. O'Leary, Secretary of Energy.
The United States is pondering methods of making its surplus weapons plutonium as unusable as possible, perhaps by mixing it in glass with highly radioactive wastes from the plutonium's creation, and burying the mixture deep underground, or perhaps by running it through reactors, burning some and rendering the remainder highly radioactive.
Russian officials could not disagree more. "This is a sacrilege," said Viktor M. Murogov, director of the Institute of Physics and Power Engineering at Obninsk, who refers to plutonium as "our national treasure." To the Russians, plutonium is a prize pearl that America now appears ready to throw out with the oyster shells.
"We have spent too much money making this material to just mix it with radioactive wastes and bury it," said Viktor N. Mikhailov, Russia's Minister of Atomic Energy.
In Russia the damage to the environment and to human health has been substantially larger, and is probably still continuing. But the Russians believe that in future decades, the world nuclear industry will revive and uranium will become scarcer and more expensive, making plutonium more attractive as a fuel.
"The 21st century will belong to nuclear power," said Mr. Mikhailov in an interview here. He also argued that a future generation of plutonium-burning reactors could have the added benefit of destroying the most toxic elements of nuclear waste.
Another senior official, Yuri Vishevsky, the head of Gosatomnadzor or GAN, the Russian equivalent of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, said in a separate interview that breeders were the only rational way for plutonium to be used.
"Will our children and grandchildren be thankful to us when they experience a lack of fuel in the future?" he asked.
For now, Russia's elaborate construction plans may be little more than pipe dream. Minatom, as Mr. Mikhailov's ministry is known, is so cash-strapped that it is months behind in paying weapons scientists and other nuclear workers, who sometimes seize their workplaces and stage strikes. Still, design work is continuing at Obninsk, about 60 miles from Moscow.
 
The U.S.
Changing Course On Plutonium

Though the United States once envisaged using plutonium to make electricity, now it thinks that would be uneconomical and would present terrorists with inviting targets for theft.
The United States did spend $1.7 billion on a breeder reactor in the 1970's and early 80's. But that was when uranium was expensive and the number of nuclear power plants in the United States and abroad was expected to soar.
Economics and politics undermined the nuclear industry. Partly as a result, the price of uranium, $40 a pound in 1982, is only a little over $5 a pound now. America dropped its breeder plans a decade ago.
American experts believe that there is a long-term glut of uranium. So the Department of Energy is looking for ways to get plutonium out of circulation.
All the separated, readily usable plutonium in the United States today is in the hands of the military -- in weapons, stockpiles or components from disassembled weapons. Plutonium from dismantled weapons in the form of "pits," or steel-wrapped spheres, is now piling up in bunkers at the Pantex plant, near Amarillo, Tex., where it is considered safe from theft for the time being.
 
Plan for Commercial Use
 A commercial lobby is developing for turning plutonium into reactor fuel rather than encasing it in glass. Some existing plants could be modified to take plutonium, mixed with uranium. But there are also proposals for new reactors.
Combustion Engineering, a subsidiary of Asea Brown Boveri, has proposed building two huge new reactors at the Savannah River Site, near Aiken, S.C., to burn the plutonium, with the electricity being sold to utilities. The surplus American stockpile could be burned up in 25 years. The end product would still have about 80 percent of the plutonium of the original, but mixed into spent fuel, a form that would give a thief a lethal radiation dose within minutes.
"We're talking about taking plutonium that is already a weapons concern and converting it into something that's less of a risk," said George A. Davis, the company's project manager for the South Carolina plan.
The reactors do not make sense as an energy project, he acknowledged. "Nobody in their right mind would put up with the risks and headaches just to generate electricity," he said. But they are a relatively cheap way to get rid of the plutonium, he said.
Savannah River also has a factory that is supposed to encase nuclear wastes into strong glass, which some say could be a vessel for disposing of plutonium. But operation has been stalled by severe technical problems.
It is not clear yet which alternative would be cheaper or environmentally safer, but mixing the plutonium with glass has one advantage: it would not undermine American arguments abroad that no one should use plutonium for civil power projects. Also, Americans do not want to encourage Russia to use its plutonium in its existing power plants unless they can be upgraded to meet Western safety standards.
Both methods pose technical hazards, and there is as yet no place to bury the products that would result, either steel-wrapped glass cylinders 2 feet in diameter and 10 feet long, or spent fuel rods from power plants.
The object is to make weapons disassembly as irreversible as possible.
"I'd like to be in a race with them, and I'd like them to win," Mrs. O'Leary, the Energy Secretary, said in an interview in May.
 
Russia
Do Fuel Needs Outrank Security?
 But Russia has a distinctly different idea of what it is racing to. Here, mixing good plutonium with glass or squandering it in light-water reactors is out of the question.
Mr. Murogov, director of the Obninsk institute, said in an interview that if the plutonium that Western engineers fret over today is not economically viable immediately, that does not mean that it is garbage; it means that the economy will eventually change to favor its use.
"These are the products for future technology, which we cannot use today," he said.
He rejects the American sense of urgency about transforming the plutonium into a form less usable in bombs: "One has to think that any haste here is not necessary."
"When people in the nuclear industry use such words as expediently, or short period of time, I visualize Chernobyl," he said.
Russian scientists recognize that virgin uranium is far cheaper than plutonium, but they -- with some support in Japan and Europe -- do not believe this will last.
Russia is ready to invest in the long term with money it does not have. But it will be getting some hard currency soon, $10 billion over 20 years from the United States.
Mr. Mikhailov, the minister, said he hopes to use some of that money to help build new breeder reactors that will produce plutonium, another bomb-usable material. It is not clear how the United States could stop such use of the money.
Mr. Mikhailov dismisses the threat of nuclear theft, foresees a vast new generation of reactors and a pressing need for plutonium to run them. Completing the first two reactors and a factory to turn the plutonium into reactor fuel would cost $2.5 billion, according to experts at the Institute of Physics & Power Engineering.
Energy Department officials say the idea that the United States might indirectly finance the breeders is very troubling. But some are skeptical of the Russian plans.
"Reviving the nuclear industry is romanticism," said Mrs. O'Leary. If the Russians have money to continue, she added, "how is it they haven't paid their workers?"
But Russia, other officials point out, if no longer a superpower, is still a sovereign state.
"Some people say they don't want the Russians doing anything with nuclear power because they don't think the Russians can do anything well," said Glenn E. Schweitzer, the executive director of the International Science and Technology Center in Moscow and an American expert on Russian science. "In the longer view, in the next 10 years or 15 years, they're going to control their own destiny."
He visited one of the breeder reactor sites, in Beloyarsk, earlier this year, and described it as "stuck in the mud" for want of money, but said that the Ministry for Atomic Power is determined to proceed.
Russia is a country of remarkable variety in its level of technical achievement. Moscow, for example, is a city of rotary-dial telephones, each of which receives only one line. Mr. Mikhailov, the energy minister, in a sign of status, has eight on his desk, seven white and one red.
But if Russia lags in telecommunications, it excels in its variety of nuclear reactors, used in everything from icebreakers to spacecraft.
And Minatom is not ready to stop. The Soviet logic still holds for the ministry: that using reactors at home made more oil and gas available for export, and that in a vast land with limited rail and pipeline transport, shipping uranium fuel is far easier than shipping coal, oil or gas.
 
Disposal
Burn Plutonium Or Bury It?

Not everyone agrees. Aleksei V. Yablokov, an adviser to President Boris N. Yeltsin and a former environment minister, said in an interview that it was no longer clear that existing nuclear reactors, let alone new ones, made economic sense.
The country could replace all its reactors with natural gas and coal-fired power plants for $6 billion to $7 billion over six or seven years, he said. In contrast, he said, the International Atomic Energy Agency had told him that upgrading the existing reactors to Western safety standards would take between $26 billion and $120 billion.
But, he said, "Minatom is a country inside a country, with its own rules, its own morals. They have not only nuclear facilities; they have a construction organization, their own air fleet, their own railways."
"If Mikhailov and Minatom have a choice, they will make a choice that is suitable and profitable for Minatom, not for the country," he said.
Minatom has a momentum and an institutional problem that in some ways resembles those of the United States Department of Energy, which has also lost its main mission, making weapons. Western experts say Minatom has 1 million employees, many with no clear purpose today.
The decision to build breeders would eventually have to be approved by President Yeltsin and other top officials. But in numerous conflicts in the last two years, said Mr. Yablokov, Mr. Mikhailov, an entrenched bureaucrat whose ministry is the mainstay of whole cities, has usually prevailed.
If they do go ahead, the Russian engineers envisage keeping the weapons plutonium in storage for the next few decades and use their existing surplus of reactor-grade plutonium instead. The reason is that some components of reactor-grade plutonium break down over the course of a few years and become more radioactive and thus harder to handle; the weapons-grade plutonium is immortal, in human terms.
Even as Russian and American officials grope for the most sensible policy, commercial interests are actively pushing their own proposals. An American company is lobbying the Russians to adopt yet another kind of reactor. General Atomics, of San Diego, Calif., has for years been trying to market a reactor fueled by uranium or plutonium in ceramic pellets, and cooled by helium gas.
In a sign of the aggressive marketing, Mr. Velikhov, director of the Kurchatov Institute, has a brass plaque hanging on his Moscow office wall proclaiming him the winner of the 1992 General Atomics/University of California at San Diego Scientific Achievement Award.
If an answer to the plutonium problem is elusive in Russia, it is elusive in the United States, too, though perhaps not with the same urgency. The Department of Energy hopes to make a proposal later this year, and building a new reactor to destroy plutonium is a possibility, said Mrs. O'Leary, "If it can burn up existing stuff and not be left with a bigger problem than I started out with."
She was wary, she said, of solutions that did not include a final form and a final repository. Otherwise, she said, disposal of plutonium would only create "a second-generation problem that then belongs to a governor or a mayor."
 
YESTERDAY Because of poor accounting, Russia cannot know for sure if any nuclear bomb ingredients have been stolen.
 
TODAY Russia and the United States have drastically different intentions for their growing surplus stocks of weapons plutonium.
 
TOMORROW Fears of nuclear proliferation are raised by the energy plans of America's closest allies.
 
 
A Nuclear Glossary
 URANIUM, an element found in nature, must be "enriched" for use in most power plants. It is processed to raise the proportion of one form, U-235, the kind that is easiest to split in a reactor or bomb and comprises only 0.7 percent of natural uranium.
LOW-ENRICHED URANIUM, which is 3 to 5 percent U-235, fuels conventional power reactors in the United States, Japan and Western Europe.
HIGHLY ENRICHED URANIUM, for use in bombs and some research and submarine reactors, is over 90 percent U-235. Like plutonium it can be used to make bombs, but larger quantities are needed and it is more easily rendered useless for weapons through mixing with natural uranium.
PLUTONIUM, an element that exists in only trace amounts in nature, is manufactured in reactors by bombarding atoms of the uranium isotope U-238 until they absorb a neutron and become Pu-239.
WEAPONS-GRADE PLUTONIUM, prized by scientists making bombs, is separated from uranium that has been kept only briefly in a reactor, so that more than 93 percent is Pu-239.
REACTOR-GRADE PLUTONIUM is separated from uranium that spent months or years in the reactor, so that many of the atoms have absorbed more than one neutron and become Pu-240 or Pu-241. It is less efficient as a weapons fuel but can still be used to make bombs.
MIXED OXIDE FUEL (MOX) is reactor fuel made by mixing uranium oxide and plutonium oxide, rather than the conventional fuel, pure uranium oxide. This allows use of plutonium to fuel certain conventional reactors.
REPROCESSING means chopping up spent reactor fuel rods and chemically separating the plutonium, uranium and other products left over from splitting uranium. This produces plutonium that can be re-used in power plants or used in bombs.
SEPARATED PLUTONIUM, as the plutonium product of reprocessing is known, is poisonous but not highly radioactive, in contrast to the plutonium that remains in spent fuel rods, and is thus an inviting target for theft by covert bomb-makers.
NUCLEAR REACTORS use uranium or plutonium fuel to produce energy. In the process they also produce plutonium, although conventional models consume more fuel than they produce.
LIGHT-WATER REACTORS, most common in power plants, use ordinary water in the core to create conditions conducive to a chain reaction; in the former Soviet Union many reactors use graphite for the same purpose.
BREEDER REACTORS, of which there are only a handful in the world, create plutonium in greater quantities than the uranium or plutonium fuel they burn.

HEADLINE: Democrats' New Overseer Is Everybody's Mr. Inside

BYLINE: By STEPHEN ENGELBERG, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 18

 BODY:
When Congress last year was blocking final Government approval of a genetically engineered hormone that had cost hundreds of millions of dollars to develop, the drug's maker, the giant chemical concern Monsanto, turned for advice to a man renowned for his skills as a legislative strategist.
When Sun Diamond Growers, the California agribusiness, organized a dinner earlier this year to retire the Congressional campaign debt of Henry Espy, brother of Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy, it called on one of the most prolific fund-raisers in the history of the Democratic Party. 
 And last week, when President Clinton was looking for a gifted political pro who could rebuild the President's popularity and rescue sagging Democratic prospects for the November elections, he chose a man with an encyclopedic knowledge of the nation's Congressional districts.
The man whose expertise is so prized by so many disparate groups? Tony L. Coelho, who left Congress as House majority whip in 1989 for a lucrative career as a New York investment banker amid accusations that he had improperly used his political contacts to arrange and finance a $100,000 junk-bond investment for himself.
Since leaving the House, Mr Coelho has commuted to New York, where he has learned the intricacies of money management. At the same time, he has kept his hand very much in the Washington game, and the announcement last week that he was accepting a three-month unpaid stint as chief strategist and spokesman at the Democratic National Committee brought mixed responses.
While the coterie of Democratic campaign consultants and career politicians embraced it as a savvy move by a miscue-prone White House, others worried that Mr. Coelho was once again blurring the lines among business, politics and personal interest.
"I'm never happy unless I have several balls in the air," Mr. Coelho said in a recent interview. And that he has.
Since Mr. Clinton's election almost two years ago, Mr. Coelho has served as an informal adviser to the White House, attending several high-level strategy meetings a month. He is raising money for the legal defense fund that will help the President fight Whitewater accusations and a former Arkansas employee's sex harassment charges. And his former aides hold important posts in the Clinton Administration.
What Mr. Coelho calls his "extended family" includes Thomas R. Nides, chief of staff to Mickey Kantor, the United States Trade Representative; Marcia L. Hale, head of the White House office that deals with governors and state legislators, and Kim Schnoor, senior aide to Agriculture Secretary Espy. Leon E. Panetta, his former colleague in the California Congressional delegation, is now the White House chief of staff and was instrumental in the selection of Mr. Coelho as the new party overseer.
 
Common Cause Sees A Danger
 At the same time, Mr. Coelho earns more than $1 million a year as president of a subsidiary of Wertheim Schroder & Company, a New York investment bank that manages nearly $4 billion for pension funds, corporations and well-heeled individuals. Mr. Coelho's contacts, and the investment bank's impressive track record, have made it one of the fastest-growing such companies on Wall Street.
Fred Wertheimer, president of the public-interest lobbying group Common Cause, says Mr. Coelho's roles at the White House and in the Democratic Party put him in a "quasi-public, quasi-private" position that could allow his banking company to take advantage of inside information about government policy. "That's not an argument that he's going to do it," Mr. Wertheimer said. "But it's a dangerous situation."
Mr. Coelho says he gains no business advantages from his ties to the Clinton Administration and never lobbies for companies or friends who need help from the Government, although he acknowledges that clients frequently seek his counsel on the ways of Washington.
"It happens all the time," Mr. Coelho said. "I will give people advice. People will say to me, 'Tony, I'm having this problem with Joe Schmo or X bill or agency.' I will give them my best advice, based on 25 years in government. But if they want something done, I say, 'Go see this law firm or that lobbyist.' "
Mr. Coelho said he saw no reason to disclose a list of his clients, as Mr. Wertheimer of Common Cause has suggested. He agreed that it would be improper for him to remain on Wall Street if he held a paid position in the Democratic Party, saying, "I would have to make a complete break."
Lloyd N. Cutler, who accepted a temporary stint as White House counsel, took a leave of absence from his law firm to do so. And several of the political consultants who advise Mr. Clinton, including James Carville and Paul Begala, have publicly disclosed their client lists.
But both Mr. Carville and Mr. Begala are paid for their work, under contract with the Democratic National Committee. In contrast, Mr. Coelho said, "I don't get a cent."
"I'm an adviser," said Mr. Coelho, who, unlike some of Mr. Clinton's other informal advisers, has never held the permanent pass that grants unfettered access to the White House. "I don't have an office, I don't have hours. I'm a citizen of this country who is advising the people who run my party."
Few citizens, however, have his connections or cachet.
Consider how Mr. Coelho advised Monsanto on its struggle to win approval for the genetically engineered hormone, bovine somatotropin, which enhances the milk production of cows. It is a case study of the interlocking relationships that Mr. Coelho can call on. As he put it, "I've lived in this town for 30 years, and I love networking."
 
A Call to Coelho, A Call From Him
 At a House hearing in June 1986, Mr. Coelho, then a subcommittee chairman, seemed opposed to the hormone, repeatedly asking why the Agriculture Department had helped develop it when the American dairy industry faced a milk glut. (Mr. Coelho says now that he did not really oppose the hormone and that he held the hearing only to placate a Wisconsin Republican whose vote he needed on his own dairy bill.)
Seven years later, Monsanto's president, Robert B. Shapiro, called Mr. Coelho at the suggestion of a friend. Congress, which Mr. Coelho had long since left, had just imposed a 90-day moratorium on the sale of the hormone and was demanding further study of its economic impact on small dairy farmers. When he called Mr. Coelho, Mr. Shapiro said in an interview, the company was "eager to find people who could give us advice and perhaps be helpful."
Mr. Coelho, who has epilepsy, says he saw the drug as the vanguard of a biotechnology revolution that could bring cures for many diseases. "We need to have breakthroughs," he said. "and, well, here was the first breakthrough, and these people were trying to stop it." Mr. Coelho says he never had business dealings with Monsanto or Mr. Shapiro. His investment bank, a spokesman said, holds stock in neither Monsanto nor any biotechnology company.
After receiving that call from Mr. Shapiro, Mr. Coelho called the Agriculture Department to find out where things stood. Mr. Coelho has some of his strongest ties at Agriculture. Secretary Espy won his first race for Congress, in 1986, with substantial financial help from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which was then headed by Mr. Coelho. Further, Mr. Espy's selection by Mr. Clinton as Agriculture Secretary came on Mr. Coelho's recommendation. And before the new Secretary picked his staff, Mr. Coelho proposed several choices to him; one, Kim Schnoor, a former Congressional aide of Mr. Coelho, became Mr. Espy's domestic counselor.
It was Ms. Schnoor who received the call that Mr. Coelho made to the Agriculture Department to see whether anyone there was blocking approval of the hormone. According to an internal Monsanto memo, Mr. Coelho stood ready to hammer home the company's concerns at a dinner he was planning with Mr. Espy.
The Monsanto memo, dated Sept. 21, 1993, expressed hope that Mr. Coelho would enlist Mr. Espy to persuade Mr. Panetta, then the head of the White House Office of Management and Budget, to "duck" a request from Congress for a study of the hormone's economic effects.
Within a few days, a copy of the internal Monsanto memo was obtained and made public by the Washington-based Foundation on Economic Trends, a group that questions the hormone's safety. The dinner meeting between Mr. Espy and Mr. Coelho never took place.
Nonetheless the hormone received final approval from Congress, a few months after the Office of Management and Budget, in completing its study, had concluded that the economic effects of the hormone would be minimal.
Jeremy Rifkin, president of the Foundation on Economic Trends, says the conversation between Ms. Schnoor and Mr. Coelho was inappropriate. The Monsanto memo, he says, is proof that Ms. Schnoor provided "sensitive information to give Coelho ammunition to make Monsanto's case with the Secretary."
Tom Amontree, deputy press secretary at the Agriculture Department, disagrees. He says Ms. Schnoor engaged in a brief conversation with Mr. Coelho in which she explained only that the Office of Management and Budget was handling the study.
In a letter hand-delivered to the Agriculture Department, Mr. Rifkin demanded at the time that the department investigate the incident. But no inquiry was ever undertaken, and Mr. Amontree says the letter from Mr. Rifkin was lost. Mr. Rifkin says he plans to renew his protest this week, this time to Attorney General Janet Reno.
Six months after the tussle over Monsanto, Mr. Coelho lent a helping hand to a politician in need. This time the beneficiary was Mr. Espy's brother Henry, who had unsuccessfully run for the Secretary's old Congressional seat in Mississippi.
The campaign had left Henry Espy saddled with a $75,000 debt, and his campaign treasurer wrote to Federal election officials that "an enormous amount of individual pledges, against which checks were issued, were not honored subsequent to Mr. Henry Espy's defeat."
Into the breach stepped Mr. Coelho and Richard Douglas, senior vice president of Sun Diamond Growers. Mr. Coelho had many contacts with the company in his years representing a California agricultural district in Congress, and his investment bank now manages about $12 million of Sun Diamond's pension money.
Mr. Douglas, a lifelong friend of Secretary Espy, sent letters on Sun Diamond's stationery inviting prospective contributors to a dinner last March 31. At the dinner, Mr. Coelho says, he gave a 20-minute presentation that reminded the audience that Henry Espy was a "good investment" who would be heard from again in politics. Secretary Espy, Mr. Coelho says, did not attend.
After the dinner, Mr. Douglas wrote to those who had attended. He thanked them for their help with "a most difficult task" and noted that Mr. Coelho stood ready to call other prospective contributors. Mr. Coelho says no one ever asked him to make any such calls, however.
Mr. Coelho's own return to prominence was not a sure thing in 1989, when he resigned from the House over his purchase of $100,000 in junk bonds from Drexel Burnham Lambert, financed in part with a loan from a troubled California savings and loan association.
After two years of investigation, Mr. Coelho says, he received a letter from the Justice Department informing him that the case had been closed. The Justice Department confirms that it declined prosecution in the matter.
After leaving Congress, Mr. Coelho ruled out the choice of many other former lawmakers: Washington lobbying. Instead, he joined a Wertheim Schroder subsidiary, Wertheim Schroder Investment Services, which had fallen on hard times.
Wertheim Schroder Investment Services manages money for large investors, union-management pension funds, corporations and individuals. Its investment performance has dramatically improved since 1989, and Mr. Coelho's contacts and persuasiveness have helped increase the amount of money it manages to nearly $4 billion, from $700 million.
Steven Kotler, president of Wertheim Schroder & Company, says an investment banking company that performed similarly but without Mr. Coelho's contacts or skills as a manager would need 10 years to achieve that much growth.
Jack Marco, president of a Chicago-based company that is a consultant to 118 union-management pension plans, notes that many firms boast flashy performance numbers. But it is personality, he says, that opens doors.
"Certainly people love to be around a star," Mr. Marco said. "Our clients say it: 'That's somebody that's in the press. I know him. He comes to our meetings. I could call him up today.' "
Mr. Coelho, Mr. Marco said, can get his company's name on a pension fund's short list more easily than many. "But if he didn't have the numbers," Mr. Marco said, "he wouldn't get the money."

HEADLINE: FLIGHT FROM CUBA: THE STATE RESPONSE;
Florida Gets the Decisiveness It Sought

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MIAMI, Aug. 18

 BODY:
For days, Gov. Lawton Chiles of Florida had pressed the Clinton Administration to do something decisive about the wave of Cuban refugees flowing to the state's southernmost shores. Tonight the Governor got his wish.
The announcement by United States Attorney General Janet Reno that the Government would begin detaining the arriving Cubans for an indefinite period was greeted warmly by Mr. Chiles, who said in an interview on CNN, "It's a day that I'm delighted is here." 
 Ms. Reno's announcement came at the end of a day in which Mr. Chiles, a Democrat who faces a tough race for re-election in November, stepped up the pressure on the Clinton Administration by declaring an immigration emergency in the state and asking the Administration to do the same.
Under the Governor's declaration, the state opened a command post in a telephone company building in downtown Key West to coordinate the efforts of Federal, state and local agencies. It deployed extra state law-enforcement officers to South Florida. And it also made plans to activate as many as 1,000 National Guard troops and, for the refugees' shelter, to use the Key West Naval Air Station as well as an outdoor area of the Monroe County jail on Stock Island, adjacent to Key West.
In addition, the state began looking for a temporary staging center to process and medically screen the stream of people -- more than 2,000 so far this month -- arriving from Cuba on boats and rafts.
 
Prodding Washington
 Those efforts by the state were envisioned only as support for a Federal operation. Mr. Chiles's declaration of an emergency was meant to prod the Government into a sense of crisis that would lead to the creation of Federal processing centers and to a naval blockade to deter more boats from coming.
"We're going to step out on our own and tell them to come join us," the Governor said of Federal officials in issuing his declaration today.
Later in the day the Administration, saying the migration was under control, declined to declare an emergency of its own, turning down Florida's request for millions of dollars in crisis aid.
But within hours the Administration had engaged in a striking about-face. Ms. Reno's announcement tonight said nothing about more money for Florida but made clear that the policy of indefinite detention would begin immediately.
 
Contrast to Mariel
 In issuing his declaration of emergency earlier in the day, Mr. Chiles said the state's efforts might be enough, for the next few days, to deal with the vast migration of Cubans even without Federal help.
Those efforts by the state were in stark contrast to its response to the Mariel boatlift of 1980, in which 125,200 Cuban refugees arrived over a period of five months and caught Florida unprepared. Back then, Dade County -- Miami and its environs -- was forced to set up a processing center in a park and turn the Orange Bowl into a tent city.
That earlier influx cost the state an estimated $150 million in unreimbursed expenses for increased social services, although some economists later said the refugees had given a boost to South Florida's economy by taking jobs as laborers, dishwashers and repairmen, mostly for Hispanic businesses.
"Back then we had nothing," Tony Ojeda, assistant Dade County manager, said of the migration from the Cuban port of Mariel 14 years ago. "I got a call in our offices one day saying there are Cubans coming in a bus. Now we have the experience of what happened, and the Governor has taken action to contain the process and assist local authorities."
 
Cursory Processing to End
 To this point, the new Cuban refugees have received only cursory Federal processing before being released into the country, in keeping with a three-decade-old open-door policy toward Cubans who flee the Havana Government.
Before Ms. Reno's announcement tonight, Joaquin G. Avino, the Dade County Manager, had asked her to open a special Federal center to process the new Cuban arrivals and to hold them until they find a relative or other sponsor able to support them financially for at least a year.
And Mr. Chiles's office, expressing certainty that events would ultimately force the Government to create such holding centers, said he would exercise his executive authority as Governor of the state to prevent any refugees from leaving the centers until they were screened for health problems and criminal records.
Immigration has long been a source of friction between Federal officials and Mr. Chiles, who was a United States Senator during the Mariel boatlift. At the time, he expressed dissatisfaction with what he regarded as President Jimmy Carter's late response to the crisis.
Now the Governor, who wants Washington to assume responsibility for immigrants to his state, has sued the Government to try to recover more than $800 million a year in costs associated with illegal immigration.
The arrival of refugees on South Florida's shores continued without respite today. As of 9 o'clock tonight, the Coast Guard said, the total for the day was 527, virtually equal to the 537 who arrived on Wednesday.
On the busiest day of the Mariel boatlift, aides to the Governor said, about 850 arrived. Still, as Mr. Chiles himself noted, the current flow "is not a trickle."

HEADLINE: FLIGHT FROM CUBA: THE REFUGEES;
A Journey That Began 2 Years Ago

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: KEY WEST, Fla., Aug. 18

 BODY:
Dayely Gonzalez de la Olivia, is a skinny 12-year-old with long brown hair and a fashion sense so keen that when they distributed the new clothes at the refugee center here, she managed to find a pink and white shirt that perfectly matched the rosy gemstones in the earrings she wore on her trip across the Florida Straits.
Of everything she had owned in Cuba, those earrings were the only possessions she still had from her old life. She and her parents, 48-year-old Pedro Felix Gonzalez Pita and his wife, 34-year-old Maura de la Olivia, came with nothing but the clothes they wore. They had no money, no suitcases, not even family snapshots -- those were left behind with Dayely's grandparents. 
 They are among the hundreds of Cubans who have headed for Florida in boats and rafts in recent days, many built of foam, inner tubes or wood, and some powered by old automobile engines.
For this family, the craft was a 17-foot motorboat towing a five foot dinghy. Aboard were 15 men, women and children and a terrier named Sisi.
 
A Two-Year Journey
 For the Gonzalez family, the journey began two years ago as the Cuban economy crumbled without the support of Soviet subsidies. That's when Mr. Gonzalez bought the motorboat on the black market with American dollars. He said he got the money by selling an old Soviet-made Lada automobile, which he had fixed up after buying it with money he had made by selling gasoline at his Government job as a gas depot attendant.
They lived in an industrial neighborhood on the outskirts of Havana, and kept the boat with a friend 25 miles away in Mariel. For two years they waited for the right time to leave, which came two weeks ago when Cuban President Fidel Castro threatened to no longer block the departures of Cubans.
By last week, the new arrivals said, it was obvious that Mr. Castro's threat had come partly true, and that it had become clear to Cubans that if they left on their own boats -- and not on vessels stolen from the Government -- nobody would block their passage. "They didn't say it clearly, but everybody knows," Ms. de la Olivia said.
The group of 15, 7 of whom had traveled from Havana on three motorcycles with sidecars, assembled Monday evening in Mariel. They got in the boats and headed north. "The Cuban Coast Guard saw us from the land. They let us go," she said. "Before, they would throw you in jail."
On the way, all but 4 of the 15 got seasick, but other than that, it was a ride of relative comfort. They had good weather, calm seas and plenty of water, ham sandwiches and Pepsi. The soft drinks and meat had been bought on the black market.
On Wednesday, after nearly two days at sea, they were spotted by the crew of a Key West fishing boat, Black Beans. The fishermen called the Coast Guard, which took the Cubans to Key West where they were interviewed by agents of the Immigration and Naturalization Service and then turned over to the transit home for Cuban refugees near Key West.
Like many Cubans who have lived their entire lives under Fidel Castro's 35-year-old rule, Ms. de la Olivia said she just wanted something different for herself and her family." I was born in 1960. I was born with Fidel, and I want to have what I've never had before," she said. "We never celebrated Christmas in Cuba."
For Mr. Gonzalez, living in the United States will mean being able to do business without the threat of arrest, he said. He plans to use his skills as an auto mechanic to support his family in Miami, where they hope to settle down with an aunt.
And for Dayely, her hopes for the future are clear. She said she'll start with high school, where she said picking up English wouldn't be that hard, especially since she had taken a year of English in Cuban primary school and is well versed at a basic, "Hello, what is your name?" From there she wants to be a fashion model, and after that a lawyer. "I'd like to do it to defend people," she said. "People who deserve to be defended."
On Thursday afternoon, the Gonzalez family boarded an air-conditioned bus that would take them 150 miles up the Florida Keys to Miami. Clutching a bag given to her at the transit home that contained a doll, a stuffed animal and some new clothes, Dayely found a seat next to her father and smiled. "This is the most wonderful country," she said, and they headed for the mainland.

HEADLINE: Market Place

BYLINE: By Allen R. Myerson 

DATELINE: DALLAS

 BODY:
THOSE who missed the F.D.I.C.'s clearance sale a few years back have few chances left to establish a hefty presence in Texas banking. Most of the merchandise is long gone.
By far the largest bank still based in Texas is Cullen/Frost Bankers Inc., its headquarters not Houston or Dallas but slower, sleepier San Antonio. In recent years, its sale has been forecast as often as hot weather in a San Antonio August. 
 The state's next-largest banks, about half its size, are in Laredo (population 128,433) and Victoria (population 56,987).
A gust of takeover talk about a year ago lifted Cullen/Frost stock from the low $30's to almost $40 a share. It has since slipped, but improving profits and reduced loan losses have restored it to $38 as of yesterday in Nasdaq trading.
Investors, analysts and other bankers still find that scrutinizing the Cullen/Frost loan portfolio or calculating financial ratios isn't nearly as much fun as playing matchmaker.
Executives of the much larger Bank One Texas, whose parent company is based in Columbus, Ohio, are frank about their affections. "Tom Frost knows we love him,' said Harvey Mitchell, the Bank One Texas chief executive, in an interview.
About the only one not playing matchmaker is Mr. Frost, Cullen/ Frost's lanky chief executive, whose great-grandfather founded the bank in 1868. None of his larger rivals can charm him enough to smooch.
"They're doing very well with the money I paid the F.D.I.C. to keep them in business," he said in an interview earlier this year. He was referring to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's bailouts allowing Banc One, Nationsbank and others to buy Texas institutions that failed.
When Mr. Frost mentions Texas Commerce Bank -- "Excuse me. I meant Chemical" -- he wants nobody to forget that it has a corporate parent (though in a deal without Federal aid) based in New York.
Mr. Frost, who is 66, has four sons working for his company. To further discourage a takeover, the elder Mr. Frost and other top executives have generous golden parachutes. In a change of control, he would get as much as $1.9 million.
A chief executive's denials about wanting to sell out are sometimes mere coyness, but the price of Cullen/ Frost's stock indicates that at least some investors believe him.
It trades at between 11 and 12 times the $3.30 in per-share earnings that analysts expect this year. That price probably includes a few points for the possibility of a takeover, but other Southwestern banks that seem more eager to be acquired trade at higher multiples.
Banks wanting to enter Texas or expand here have proved willing to pay up. About a year ago, Boatmen's Bancshares of St. Louis, which announced a plan yesterday to buy the Worthen Banking Corporation of Little Rock, Ark., successfully offered $28.16 a share for the First Amarillo Bancorporation when its stock was trading at $19. Analysts estimate Cullen/Frost would bring $50 a share, at the very least.
Texas -- now the second-largest state in population, its economy growing faster than the nation's -- has many attractions for outsiders, and even Mexicans are looking to buy in. But the state is already teeming with many of the country's sharpest, most competitive banks.
Whatever price his company might fetch, Mr. Frost contends that he can best serve shareholders by raising profits and remaining independent. Last year was his first since the 1980's without large charge-offs for bad loans.
William I. Baldwin, an analyst at Rauscher Pierce Refsnes, says that a reorganization and some cutbacks last year lowered expenses, but they remain high. Mr. Frost agrees, noting the need to move out of some offices that he describes as "big, high shrines."
Next, his company needs to expand its lending. The same conservatism that barely pulled it through the Texas banking depression has kept loans to 36 percent of its $3.7 billion in assets, about 10 percentage points below the Texas average.
Cullen/Frost investors or acquirers now have the added incentive of a Mexico play. The company has correspondent relationships, involving business referrals across the border, with 14 Mexican banks. Many of those ties were developed by Mr. Frost himself.
In the bank's latest annual report, a map labeled "Cullen/Frost Markets" includes everything from the Texas panhandle down to the jungles of Chiapas, Mexico. Mr. Frost boasts of listening to Spanish talk radio to keep up with his customers in San Antonio, the nation's largest city with a Hispanic majority.
He spends less time listening to analysts and writers who have long said that medium-sized banks, like his, are being squeezed out by small niche players and large efficiency experts. Just recently, he said, a trade publication warned in-betweeners to find bigger partners to survive. "I can't find the article now," he said yesterday. "It's somewhere in my garbage pail.'

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
Sony's Operating Profits Up, But Net Plunges in Quarter

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Aug. 18

 BODY:
The Sony Corporation reported today that operating profits for the first quarter rose 25.7 percent from a year earlier. Net income, however, plunged 49.2 percent, in large measure because the company did not make as much money as it did last year from currency hedging.
Sony said revenues for the quarter, which ended on June 30, increased 4.3 percent, to 864.5 billion yen, or $8.73 billion when translated at 99 yen to the dollar. Operating income was 31.8 billion yen, or $321.2 million. Net income dropped to 3.9 billion yen, or $39.5 million. 
 Sony, which is based here, said earnings were hurt by the continued sluggishness of the economy in Japan and by the gains in the yen against the dollar and other foreign currencies. Had the yen remained at the same level as a year ago, sales would have increased by 9.5 percent instead of 4.3 percent, the company said.
Sony's movie business, which was mired in losses last year, also dragged down profits. Operating income was not reported separately for the movie business, Columbia and Tristar Pictures, but sales decreased 4.3 percent, to 64.3 billion yen, or $649.2 million.
But Sony said operating profits benefited from cost cutting and from strong business in Asia and the United States and with an improvement in the economy in Europe.
Sony's worldwide sales of compact disk players, Walkman portable stereos and color televisions were up, though sales of video recorders remained flat.
Sony's music business, based on the former CBS Records, turned in a strong performance because of hit albums like Mariah Carey's "Music Box." Sales of the music group rose 12 percent, to 108.1 billion yen, or $1.1 billion.
In the first quarter a year ago, Sony's net income was bolstered by a 20.4 billion yen gain in foreign exchange because of currency hedging contracts. In the most recent quarter, the yen did not fluctuate as much and foreign exchange gains were only 7.5 billion yen. That accounted for the drop in net income despite the improvement in operating income, Sony said.

HEADLINE: FLIGHT FROM CUBA: THE OVERVIEW;
U.S. Halts Hundreds of Cubans At Sea in Abrupt Policy Change

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 19

 BODY:
The United States today plucked hundreds of Cuban refugees from rafts and boats off the Florida coast and began to transfer them to detention camps in Guantanamo Bay as President Clinton ordered an end to the longstanding policy of welcoming fleeing Cubans with open arms.
With more Cubans taking to the seas than at any time since 1980, the abrupt change of American policy was aimed at averting a new Caribbean exodus, much as the Administration has sought to discourage Haitians from leaving their country by denying them entry to the United States. 
 Instead of being ferried on to Florida, all fleeing Cubans now intercepted by the Coast Guard and the United States Navy are to be delivered to new camps at the American base in Guantanamo, near Cuba's southeast tip, where they will join some 15,000 Haitians already being held there.
By 8:30 P.M., Coast Guard cutters patrolling the Straits of Florida had picked up 454 Cuban refugees from 40 boats, a flow that maintained an alarming stream that began early this month. They could be transferred as early as Saturday to another vessel to begin the 42-hour journey to the military base that will at least temporarily be their new home.
The action drew strong criticism among Cuban-Americans, many of whom said it was wrong to punish Cubans for seeking refuge from Fidel Castro. Because Mr. Clinton offered no immediate new plan to encourage the ouster of the Cuban leader, Republican leaders and some Democrats in Congress also found fault with it, saying that it ignored the main reason that so many Cubans sought to flee the island. [Page 11.]
In an attempt in part to answer some of the criticisms, Mr. Clinton met at the White House tonight with a half-dozen Cuban-American leaders, including Jorge Mas Canosa, the head of the Cuban American National Foundation. The President also approved a statement announcing new steps aimed at putting pressure on the Castro Government, including seeking United Nations condemnation of human rights abuses in Cuba, an expanded United States ban on commercial air traffic to Cuba to include charter flights, and cutting in half, to $150 per quarter, the amount of money an American household may send to Cuban citizens.
Administration officials also said specially equipped American EC-130 military aircraft would soon begin flights near Cuba to broadcast messages urging Cubans to avoid taking to the seas.
The President's new instructions mark an end to 28 years in which the United States has allowed Cuban refugees who made their way here or who were rescued offshore to stay. Under the new policy, even Cubans who do somehow land in the United States are to be held until their applications to stay in the country can be reviewed, and some of those who have arrived in recent days were detained today.
Mr. Clinton, who announced the plan at a news conference, said the change was necessary to prevent "a cold blooded attempt" by Mr. Castro to export an internal crisis by flooding south Florida with refugees. He said a failure by the United States to shut its doors would risk repetition of the Mariel boat lift of 1980 in which 120,000 Cubans made their way to American shores.
"We tried it that way once," Mr. Clinton said of the previous open door. "It was wrong then, it's wrong now, and I'm not going to let it happen again."
The President's announcement, which came after 24 hours of awkward scrambling and mixed signals within the Administrationwas greeted with relief by Governor Lawton Chiles of Florida, who also attended tonight's White House meeting, and others in the state who had urged that Washington act quickly to head off the potential crisis.
For now, the change means that fleeing Cubans will be treated the same as fleeing Haitians since Mr. Clinton decided in May to stop returning them to that troubled country, holding them instead in tent camps in Guantanamo while seeking havens for them outside American territory.
Aides to Mr. Clinton said tonight that many questions about the new policy remained unsettled. But they said the Administration hoped to transfer quickly any Cubans sent to Guantanamo elsewhere, perhaps Panama or the Turks and Caicos Islands, a British colony in the Bahamas, which had offered refuge to Haitians.
It was clear, however, that what the Administration sought most in its new policy was to alter the equation in which, during the last week alone, the all but certain promise of refuge in the United States tempted more than 2,000 Cubans to hazard the treacherous crossing.
Today, the President dispatched at least two American warships to the Straits of Florida to assist the Coast Guard in patrolling the waters that divide the two countries. To those Cubans who might still consider attempting the passage, Attorney General Janet Reno warned: "The odds of ending up in Guantanamo are going to be very, very great. The odds of ending up in the United States are going to be very, very small."

 Already some 14,700 Haitians are camped in Guantanamo, where a combination of boredom and poor conditions has twice in the last week ignited disturbances in which American military policemen were injured.
Cubans brought to the base in the next few days will be housed in a section of one existing camp, where cots and tents for 2,000 are erected and vacant. A senior Defense Department official said today, however, that the military would build two new camps, with a total capacity of 10,000, for Cubans brought there in the future.
Only Thursday morning, Attorney General Janet Reno had said that the Administration was not considering any change in the Cuban policy that since 1966 has welcomed virtually all fleeing Cubans to the United States.
But by late Thursday, it was Ms. Reno, at an odd late-night appearance in a partly-lit White House briefing room, who revealed that the Administration had settled on a shift in policy.
 
A Day of Wrangling
 Today, officials at the White House and other agencies said that announcement had come only after a contentious and somewhat chaotic day of wrangling about what the Administration should do to answer Governor Chiles' pleas for help.
Mr. Clinton himself had endorsed the new policy by early evening after reviewing options drafted by Anthony Lake, his national security adviser, that were presented in a day of top-level meetings. While news reports had cast the Administration as turning a cold shoulder to Governor Chiles, the President and Mr. Lake agreed that the decision would be kept secret until today's news conference.
But Ms. Reno, a former Dade County prosecutor, appealed throughout the evening to Leon E. Panetta, the White House chief of staff, that she disclose the change quickly to quell concern in her native Florida and dissuade Cubans who might attempt to flee overnight.
Finally, at 10:40 P.M., Ms. Reno read a halting statement to a half-dozen reporters and cameramen at the White House, after aides made a series of frantic telephone calls to news organizations.
The Attorney General said only that Cuban refugees would from now on be detained, but she left without providing further details. Senior officials described frustration within the Administration over the handling of such a major policy announcement.
 
Pentagon Scrambles
 There was also apprehension at the Pentagon about its new tasks of assisting the Coast Guard by transporting Cuban refugees to the Guantanamo base and running what will now amount to separate detention camps for Cubans and Haitians there.
A Navy amphibious ship, the Whidbey Island, was picking up tents from what was to have been a Haitian refugee processing center in the Turks and Caicos today to bring them to Guantanamo for use by the Cubans, and is to take up station in the Straits of Florida by Tuesday, a senior Pentagon official said. In the meantime, one of the 10 Coast Guard cutters or patrol boats in the region is likely to be used to shuttle the refugees to the military base.
A second Navy amphibious ship, the Nashville, may also be used in the operation. But the Nashville is one of two ships now off Haiti as part of a mission to stand by in case of trouble there, and the Pentagon was scrambling tonight to send another amphibious ship to the Straits of Florida to avoid disruption to the Haiti operation.

Chart: "A Closer Look: U.S. Policy Toward Cuban Refugees"
Refugees from Cuba have long had a special status under United States law. Until today nearly all those seeking to enter the United States automatically admitted. Their special status was granted under the Cuban Refugee Adjustment Act of 1966, one of several measures that marked the decades of tension between Fidel Castro and the United States. The act gives the President the latitude to determine the conditions under which Cuban refugees can remain. Following is a summary of the provisions of that act and others.
 
The Cuban Refugee Adjustment Act of 1966
This law allowed refugees from Cuba who were picked up by American authorities while attempting to flee or who entered the United States after January 1, 1959 (the beginning of Mr. Castro's regime), to apply for permanent resident alien status after a one-year stay in the United States. Permanent resident status is necessary before an alien can apply for citizenship. Prior immigration law had required nationals of Western Hemisphere countries to obtain an immigrant visa at the U.S. Consular office in their native country. The U.S. Consular Office in Cuba closed Jan. 3, 1961.
 
Trade Embargo With Cuba
 The regulations spelling out the embargo were issued by the United States Government on July 8, 1963 under the Trading With the Enemy Act:
* With some exceptions, no U.S. products, technology or services may be exported to Cuba, either directly or through third countries.
 
 * Cuban goods and services may not be imported into the U.S.
 
Cuban Democracy Act of 1992
 The purpose of this act was to tighten the economic embargo while holding out the possibility of assisting Cubans. It provides the following:

 * Tightened prohibitions regarding the licensing of trade with Cuba by foreign subsidiaries of American firms.
 
 * Authorizes direct mail delivery via the United States Postal Service between Cuba and the United States; improves telephone communications. (pg. 10)

HEADLINE: FLIGHT FROM CUBA: IN MIAMI;
Cuban-Americans Ambivalent on Shift

BYLINE: By JON NORDHEIMER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MIAMI, Aug. 19

 BODY:
Cuban-Americans today appeared to be of two minds on changing American policy on Cuban refugees.
Many railed against closing the door on 28 years of special status for Cubans fleeing Fidel Castro that enabled any who reached these shores to remain here. 
 President Clinton said today that all refugees picked up at sea will be now be sent to safe havens at Guatanamo Naval Base in Cuba and elsewhere. Those who manage to get past Coast Guard and Navy ships and land in Florida will be taken to mainland detention camps.
Though the policy change was drawing heavy criticism, it appeared at the same time that many Cuban-Americans did not welcome a repeat of the Mariel boatlift, which brought 125,000 refugees to Florida in several months in 1980. Many said that the escape of too many disgruntled refugees from Cuba would help Mr. Castro stay in power by easing tensions within Cuban society..
Since the 1960's, most Cuban refugees have been allowed to remain in the United States, no matter how they got here, with little formal processing. After the Mariel boatlift, however, the Government detained thousands who had criminal backgrounds in Cuba or who had mental problems. It tried to deport many hundreds who committed crimes while here.
 
'A Reverse Mariel'
 "Cuban-Americans don't want another Mariel," said Representative Lincoln Diaz-Balart, Republican of Miami. "Cuban-Americans want a reverse Mariel to go and ignite the spark of liberation in Cuba."
In Miami's politically charged atmosphere, few Cuban-Americans seemed to concede that the change in United States policy might help domestic pressures build for Mr. Castro by shutting off the route to America for the island's most frustrated citizens.
Spanish talk radio shows blazed against the policy change and the word on the lips of hosts and callers was "betrayal."
Mario Cabriera, who came here from Cuba a quarter-century ago, said that he backed the Clinton plan and that he thought that disgruntled Cubans should stay home and topple the Castro regime.
 
Called Castro Supporters
 Mr. Cabriera, 69 years old, a portrait photagrapher, expressed a view of the new wave of refugees that is heard often in private conversation but muted in public. "These same people are the ones who until quite recently were Castro supporters and forced us to leave our homeland."
He and others also said that they feared this generation of Cuban refugees, who have lived all their lives under Communism, would encounter great difficulty in adjusting to American life.
Another issue is that many of the new refugees are dark-skinned. How they will be received in Miami among light-skinned refugees of a generation ago is an open question. Many of those in the Mariel boatlift were also dark-skinned and it took years before they were assimilated into jobs.
 
Admiration and Sympathy
 Most of those interviewed today on the streets of the Little Havana section of Miami expressed admiration and sympathy for the men, women and children who put to sea in small boats and rubber rafts to find a better life in this country, and said that their bravery should be rewarded.
"It's not fair after the policy being one way all this time and all of a sudden changing," stormed Lazaro Cardentey, 36. The Government, said Mr. Cardentey, a refugee who landed here seven months ago from Cuba, "should recognize the courage of those risking their lives to get here."
Several of those interviewed said they resented comparisons with Haitian refugees who routinely are turned back by American ships or sent into detention camps at Guatanamo or in this country. Cubans were trying to escape Communism, not wretched economic conditions alone, and that status should be honored, not abandoned, they said.
"I think Clinton is trying to make sure there is no conflict in the community between Haitians and Cubans," said Janet Dagnesses, 24. "But until he decides what to do with Cuba and Castro there is no point in keeping the refugees from their families if they are here already."
In Key West, emotions were running high as the policy change went into effect, trapping a few hundred new arrivals in the detention net as others were the last to slip through it.
 
Under the Wire
 "We started detainment enforcement shortly before the Attorney General made the announcement," said Lemar Wooley, an Immigration and Naturalization spokesman explained. "Anyone who was on a ship or had not been processed was subject to detention."
One of the last to get in under the wire and walk free on American ground was Miriam Delgado, 30, who was rescued Thursday by the Coast Guard after spending four days adrift in a raft.
She said that she was sad for those coming behind her who would be taken to an uncertain future at Guatanamo. "It's horrible there," said Ms. Delgado, who had worked as a Government accountant in Mariel. "It's worse than being in prison in Cuba."
 
Sought Freedom in 1991
 Another who walked the streets of Key West today, unhappy about the newly erected barrier, was a man who made his dash to freedom in 1991 and became a hero in Miami. Orestes Lorenzo was the Cuban Air Force pilot who defected in a MIG fighter and returned in a Cessna to Cuba the next year to pick up his wife and children on a coastal highway and fly them to the United States.
He has been flying that same propeller plane over the Florida Straits this past week, directing rescue boats to the dots of rafts bobbing along in their high-risk escape away from their island home.

HEADLINE: Effort to Solve Energy Woes Clashes With Nuclear Safety

SERIES: After the Arms Race: Third of three articles.

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
If the collapse of nuclear controls in Russia poses the near-term threat that terrorists could seize plutonium to make nuclear weapons, longer-term fears arise from nuclear energy programs launched by America's closest allies: Japan, Britain and France.
Over the next two decades these countries, as well as Russia, plan to vastly increase the world's stockpiles of plutonium. They are producing it to fuel a generation of nuclear power plants whose time has never quite come. 
 And in the process they are deflating the post-cold-war optimism that the world's supply of bomb-usable materials would drastically shrink. Moreover, the race to produce plutonium for energy is also sustaining a rationale that nuclear aspirants like North Korea have used to justify building nuclear energy installations that can quickly be turned to weapons production.
The plutonium can be used to fuel existing reactors, in place of uranium, but also for planned breeder reactors, nuclear plants that were first conceived with enormous enthusiasm, as a virtually self-sustaining source of electric power. These reactors burn nuclear fuel while "breeding" more, and for decades seemed to offer a solution to two major problems at once.
By recycling fuel, breeders would cut down on the amount of nuclear waste that would otherwise have to be buried or sunk in the ocean. And at first blush, the technology promised billions of dollars in savings.
But the long-promised economies have evaporated, and the spread of weapons projects in the last several years -- in North Korea, Iraq, Pakistan and elsewhere -- has only underscored the inherent dangers of a world energy system based on recycled plutonium. Nuclear weapon science is everywhere, it is now clear, and the greatest obstacle to bomb production is not know-how, but access to plutonium or highly enriched uranium -- materials which, under the energy strategies being pursued by several countries, will remain in plentiful supply.
The new supplies of separated plutonium are the result of "reprocessing" -- extraction of plutonium and uranium from the spent fuel of conventional nuclear power plants. Because the extraction of plutonium is rapidly outpacing the building of the breeder reactors it was intended to fuel, a surplus of plutonium is building.
The International Atomic Energy Agency estimates there are now over 100 tons of separated civilian plutonium stockpiled around the world. Most of it is stored in Britain, France and Russia. Japan plans to obtain 50 tons more over the next 15 years, mainly produced in European plants, and within seven years it plans to open up a huge new reprocessing plant of its own. If diverted to weapons use, those supplies could produce thousands of nuclear weapons.
While officials in several countries concede that the breeder-reactor strategy is wildly uneconomical today, they say that the world will thank them one day when uranium -- the fuel for ordinary reactors -- becomes scarce and expensive.
"We take the long-term view, not the short-term," said Yasutaka Moriguchi, the director of the nuclear fuel division of Japan's Science and Technology Agency. "We are looking out 40 years ahead."
Similar views are voiced in France, Britain and Russia. But critics charge that officials in Japan and elsewhere are simply justifying expensive programs that have already created large vested interests.
 
Asian Worries About Japan
 The rise of a "plutonium economy" has created several new threats. Britain and France are nuclear powers already, but Japan's repeated insistence that it would never use its stockpile to make nuclear weapons have left its Asian neighbors unconvinced. Many point out that Japan does not actually need to build a weapon to gain strategic leverage: Its plutonium supplies, combined with the country's obvious technological prowess, create a de facto nuclear capability, without the political complications of actually possessing a weapon.
But the main fear is that a huge commerce in plutonium would be a ripe target for theft by terrorists or countries secretly desiring to build nuclear weapons.
Moreover, the spread of reprocessing technology creates a justification for countries that want to make nuclear weapons to follow suit, under the guise of conducting energy research or developing energy sources.
 
North Korean Program
 North Korea is a vivid example: Rather than obtain bomb materials from Russia or China, it produced its own from spent nuclear fuel as part of what it calls a national electrification project. And in response to the West's demands that it permanently cease reprocessing activities, Pyongyang has consistently offered a straightforward response: Japan is allowed to do it, so why not us?
China is talking about building a breeder reactor. South Korea's military leaders endorsed the idea last year, presumably in response to the North's project. There is talk of it in Taiwan, a country that was forced to abandon a nuclear weapons program of its own several years ago.
"Would you be comfortable in a world in which every country that wanted a reprocessor could have one?" asked Christopher Paine of the Natural Resources Defense Council, an American environmental group.
Officials from the International Atomic Energy Agency readily concede that the spread of reprocessing technology is creating more nuclear material than they can reliably track. Japan's project alone, still in its infancy, takes up roughly 20 percent of the agency's inspection resources.
And even if inspections are accurate, the North Korean crisis has given the world a glimpse of the "breakout" problem: Any signatory to the treaty against the spread of nuclear arms can build a reprocessing center, get technological assistance from the nuclear agency, and then declare that in three months it is withdrawing from the treaty. At that point, it is legally free to use the installations for bomb production.
"It is a huge hole in the treaty," said Andrew Mack, a professor at Australia National University who has written extensively on the subject. "And as the North Koreans showed us, just the threat of pulling out brings everyone to their knees."
As a result, the multibillion dollar plutonium trade between Europe and Japan has cast the United States in an enormously uncomfortable position. The United States stopped reprocessing nuclear materials for civilian use 17 years ago, during the Carter Administration, for fear that it would speed the spread of plutonium.
 
Exception for U.S. Allies
 Last year the Clinton Administration announced a global goal of phasing out the production of all new fissile materials that could produce weapons. But Washington has gingerly danced around the question of how to persuade the allies to back away from plutonium production for civilian reactors, carving an exception for them rather than risk a confrontation with its closest global partners.
Legally, the United States could prohibit the transport or reprocessing of nuclear material that originated in the United States, a category that includes almost all of Japan's supplies. But the political pressure not to do so has been intense.
"We encouraged them to get into this in the midst of the Cold War," a senior intelligence official said recently, "and now we can't turn off the spigot."
What has slowed the process is economics. While the Europeans are producing plutonium, they have canceled many of their breeder reactor plans. And Japan, the biggest customer for reprocessed plutonium, has been forced to scale back its ambitious program, for reasons of both politics and economics.
But earlier this year Britain started operations at a huge reprocessing installation in which it and Japan had invested billions. The Japanese are building another on the northern coast of the island of Honshu. At this point, many nuclear power executives concede, so much has been invested that there is no easy way out.
 
The Threat
Can Nuclear Fuel Produce a Bomb?
 At the core of the allies' justification for their elaborate plans is a traditional argument that there are two types of plutonium: "Reactor-grade" plutonium suitable for nuclear power generation, and "weapons-grade" for making bombs. In weapons-grade plutonium, 93 percent or more of the material is in the form of the Pu-239 isotope. Reactor-grade plutonium has a lesser concentration of Pu-239.
Japan has always insisted that because it deals only in the first type, and never in the second, any suspicions that it could decide to make nuclear weapons, or that terrorists could seize its supplies, are unfounded and alarmist.
In June, after former Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata took Japan's bureaucracy by surprise when he said that "Japan has the capability to possess nuclear weapons, but it has not made them," those arguments were rolled out again.
The Government repeated its commitment never to make or possess nuclear weapons and insisted that it "does not have any expertise or experience" in building bombs and therefore "does not have the capability to produce them."
While many experts doubt these protestations of insufficient expertise, certainly there is no public will in Japan today for the country to acquire nuclear arms.
"It is impossible, it is just simply impossible," Ryo Ikegame, the executive vice president of Tokyo Electric Power, Japan's largest utility company, said in April at an industry conference held quite deliberately in Hiroshima, in an effort to turn plutonium into a symbol for the peaceful use of energy. "No one has produced weapons from reactor fuel," he said.
 
U.S. Test in 1962
 In fact, information declassified in recent years by the Department of Energy and statements by a number of American weapons designers suggest that Japan's official argument is wrong. In 1962, American weapons laboratories built and tested at least one bomb built from reactor-grade fuel. American officials say that while perhaps four kilograms of bomb-grade plutonium are needed to make a bomb, only slightly more reactor-grade plutonium is needed.
For terrorists or countries desiring only a few weapons, "the theft of weapon-grade material or of actual weapons is likely to be the preferred path," Richard L. Garwin, a senior researcher at I.B.M., wrote recently. "But reactor grade material is also a feasible approach to the manufacture of nuclear weapons."
But, as Mr. Garwin concluded recently, "The Japanese don't want to hear this."
 
The Origins
Troubled Progress For an Industry
 Though the Japanese are the most vociferous advocates of breeder reactor technology these days, their program was not born in Tokyo. It was Washington's idea.
As soon as the American occupation ended in the early 1950's, Japan became ripe ground for the "Atoms for Peace" project. With no oil reserves of its own, even a country with a profound nuclear allergy felt it had little other choice. And in 1966, just as conventional, uranium-burning nuclear power plants were springing up along the sea coast, the Government formally declared that it would start a major project to create self-sufficient breeder reactors.
But by the 1970's, amid worries about the spread of nuclear technology and clear evidence that breeder reactors would be much more costly than conventional reactors, America's program went into decline. Congress dropped the last financing for a breeder reactor in 1983.
But by that time Tokyo had assembled a classic industrial consortium: A Government-backed firm, called the Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development Corporation, was created to coordinate reprocessing and to develop the use of plutonium as a fuel.
This spring, after decades of planning, Japan finally fired up the $5 billion "Monju" breeder reactor, named for the Buddhist god of wisdom. But by the time it opened the wisdom was under fire: Uranium prices have been so low for so long that the reactor will be an incredibly expensive source of power, in a country that already produces the world's most expensive electricity.
 
New Plant Is Begun
 Ground has been broken for a $7 billion reprocessing plant that would take nuclear waste from around the country and turn it into plutonium for re-burning. That plant, in turn, is generating pressure to build more breeder reactors, to make the whole enterprise more viable.
Japan has also invested more than $3 billion in reprocessing installations in Sellafield, England, and La Hague, France that are already operating. For several years Japan has been exporting almost all of its nuclear waste, though so far only one shipment of plutonium fuel derived from it has come back.
In short order, Japan has become a vital customer for the Europeans. Originally, the European reprocessing installations were supposed to produce fuel for European breeder reactors and conventional reactors using mixed-oxide fuel that combines uranium and plutonium. But gradually, that vision has crumbled.
After long dispute, the Germans, who began breeder work in 1956, canceled their plans after a series of technical problems. The British, after experimenting with small reactors, decided in 1988 to end their major projects, and they are unwilling to invest heavily in plans for a European breeder for fear there would be no commercial customers.
The French have been more enthusiastic. But their troubled plant called Superphenix was 2.5 times more expensive than a conventional reactor, and it was forced to shut down in 1990 because of leaks in its sodium cooling system, only recently limping backinto service.
Searching for another role for its breeders, France is studying how such reactors could consume plutonium rather than breed it, and how they could also convert long-lived, toxic radioactive isotopes in nuclear waste into material that would be radioactive for a shorter time.
Though the customers are fewer and fewer, reprocessing is continuing at a rapid pace. After years of legal delays, Britain just opened its giant Thorp reprocessing center. France's competing reprocessing center at Le Hague now takes in 130 to 140 tons of nuclear waste a month, and produces 11 tons of plutonium from it annually. But much of the waste and the plutonium sit in storage, awaiting a use. "Plutonium is a high value energy source," said Jean Louis Ricaud, the vice president of Cogema. "And its cost will come down."
 
Transportation
Plutonium Ship Sets Off an Uproar
 As the Japanese learned late in 1992 and early last year, just moving that plutonium around the world is fraught with both technical and political dangers. Its first shipment of plutonium from La Hague touched off an international uproar, made greater by environmental groups that warned countries that a shipload of some of the world's most toxic material was about to pass through their waters. South Africa, Brazil, Argentina, the Philippines and a number of small South Pacific nations banned the ship from their waters.
The outcry forced Japan to think about scaling back its plans, and no one in Tokyo dares suggest a second shipment in the near future. But big industrial projects are never abandoned in Japan, and far too much had been invested in this one. So a series of committees were created last year in Tokyo with a foreordained conclusion: To find a way to drastically slow the plutonium program without giving up the goal of a self-sustaining fuel system.
The committee never dealt with a more radical alternative proposed by Paul Leventhal, the head of the private Nuclear Control Institute in Washington. He suggests that Japan stockpile many years' supply of relatively inexpensive uranium as a way to assure a stable energy supply.
 
Japan Slows Schedule
 In June, the Japanese Government began to greatly slow its schedule. The next breeder reactor will not start operation until around 2010, if then. A second reprocessing plant, once described as a vital necessity, will not even be considered until 2030. And Japan will attempt to burn excess supplies of plutonium as mixed-oxide fuel in existing power plants, even though that flies in the face of creating a self-sustaining fuel cycle.
But as Mr. Mack wrote recently, mixing plutonium with uranium "makes no economic sense." It is far more expensive than burning the standard enriched uranium. But the alternative is that Japan will be left with upwards of 50 tons of plutonium by 2010 -- and to quell fears it might be tempted to build a bomb, it has promised that it will never stockpile more plutonium than it can use.
Japan's answer, and Europe's, has been to mount a major public relations drive to dispel the thought that plutonium is as dangerous as it sounds. Earlier this year the Japanese nuclear industry distributed an animated film to schoolchildren in which a fictional young boy drank plutonium-tainted water, with no ill effect. The letter drew an immediate protest from Hazel O'Leary, the United States Secretary of Energy, asking that the film be withdrawn.
Japanese officials, clearly embarrassed, said the film showed poor judgment, but they refused to ban it. Utility company officials also declined several public challenges to drink a similar potion themselves.
 
Regulation
Nuclear Agency Faces Challenge
 The spread of reprocessing is already creating a huge strain on the International Atomic Energy Agency. It is already strapped for funds and inspectors.
But while American policy is opposed to commercial plutonium production, the agency officially favors it, because one of its chief missions is to help promote new forms of nuclear energy. "Even the much maligned breeder reactors may one day be warmly welcomed," Hans Blix, the agency's director general, said recently, though he added that "the economic case for breeders is not present today."
Mr. Blix acknowledges, however, that his agency could be overwhelmed by the task of keeping track of so much plutonium. Japan already uses so much plutonium that several agency inspectors are permanently stationed there. Even so, upwards of 150 pounds of plutonium was recently determined to be unaccounted for, because it was stuck in the pipes of Japan's fuel fabrication plant. Japan said it would all be accounted for; critics said it showed how easy it would be for any country to make off with several bombs' worth of material under the cover of ordinary "shrinkage" in processing.
So far, there is no international mechanism to protect plutonium when it is being transported, the moment when it is presumably most vulnerable to hijacking. And as the agency learned in Iraq and North Korea, even extensive inspections cannot detect the full scope of plutonium production.
"If the use of plutonium increases, naturally we will need a far bigger mechanism for keeping track of it all," Mr. Blix said several months ago. "Right now, we do not have anything of that scale ready."
 
 THURSDAY Because of poor accounting, Russia cannot know for sure if any nuclear bomb ingredients have been stolen.
YESTERDAY Russia and the United States have drastically different intentions for their growing surplus stocks of weapons plutonium.
TODAY Fears of nuclear proliferation are raised by the energy plans of America's closest allies.

HEADLINE: FLIGHT FROM CUBA: IN CUBA;
On Beach Near Havana, Many Still Try to Flee

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: HAVANA, Aug. 19

 BODY:
Dozens of Cubans were still setting off by raft from a beach east of Havana today, even as President Clinton ordered that Cubans picked up at sea by the Coast Guard not be allowed to enter the United States.
Foreign reporters saw six rafts, made from inner tubes and wood, set off in the space of about 40 minutes from Cojimar beach, 10 miles east of the capital. People among the small crowds milling around on one section of the beach said many more rafts had left during the morning. Each raft carries about four to six people. 
 Cojimar has been a key spot in recent days for the increased flow of Cubans leaving the Communist-ruled Caribbean island by raft.
In its morning news program today, Cuba's state-run radio reported the announcement late Thursday by the United States Attorney General, Janet Reno, that Cubans arriving in the United States without visas would from now on be detained.
 
Exodus Into Flordia
 But Granma, the Communist Party newspaper, reported that Ms. Reno had said Washington was not currently contemplating a policy change on immigration. The article, noting that Florida had seen unprecedented numbers of Cubans arriving this week, said the United States was paying the price for a "hostile" immigration policy.
On the beach at Cojimar, few people were aware of the American shift. But when told about Ms. Reno's comments, several people said it would still be worth going off on a raft even if they risked detention.
"Nothing's going to stop people from going," commented one man, who said he was there to watch the spectacle of so many people leaving.
There was no official reaction yet in Havana to the Clinton Administration announcement, which amounted to a major change of the United States' 30-year-old policy of accepting all Cuban refugees.
 
Complaints by Cuba
 Under the Cuban Adjustment Act of 1966, Cubans who left the island without papers -- generally in rafts or flimsy boats -- were automatically allowed to stay in the United States. Havana has long complained that this stimulated illegal exits, since Washington at the same time restricted the number of visas it granted.
The number of people leaving Cuba, which is facing a severe economic crisis, has shot up in the last few days to the highest levels since the Mariel boatlift of 1980, when 125,000 left in an exodus that flooded Florida's social services.
The rise appears to be a result of the Cuban authorities' turning a blind eye to people trying to leave, so long as they set off in their own vessels. President Fidel Castro, reacting to a spate of hijackings of state-owned vessels, warned two weeks ago that Cuba would no longer put obstacles in the way of Cubans trying to leave the island by boat, or of their relatives in Florida coming to pick them up, if Washington did not change its immigration policy.
Almost 3,500 people have been picked by the United States Coast Guard so far in August, prompting Gov. Lawton Chiles of Florida to declare a state of emergency on Thursday.

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 19

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve's chairman, Alan Greenspan, appears to have been more reluctant than some of his colleagues to raise interest rates earlier this summer, judging from the notes of a meeting in July of top Fed officials.
The central bank's top interest-rate policy panel voted at its July meeting to allow Mr. Greenspan to raise interest rates at his discretion during the following weeks rather than wait for the next meeting of the group, according to minutes of the meeting released today. 
 But Mr. Greenspan did not exercise this discretion, and the Federal Reserve did not raise rates until its top policy makers met on Tuesday. Then Mr. Greenspan joined the other six members of the Federal Reserve Board in a unanimous vote for an increase of half a percentage point in the discount rate, which the central bank charges banks for overnight loans.
Also that day, the larger policy panel, the Federal Open Market Committee, made up of the Fed members and five presidents of the Fed's regional banks, voted a half-point increase in the target for the Federal funds rate. That is the rate banks charge each other for overnight loans.
The vote on the Federal funds rate has not been disclosed, but presumably Mr. Greenspan would not have supported a discount rate increase while opposing a rise in the Federal funds rate.
The latest jump in short-term interest rates, along with the four that have preceded it this year, won a cautious endorsement today from President Clinton. At a news conference he gave credit for the current economic expansion to his Administration's policies and said: "So I think that we have to recognize that the Fed did respond to the efforts we made, and what it's responding to now is a robust and growing economy. Of course it could be slowed down too much, but we don't have any evidence at this time that that has, in fact, occurred."
During late July and early August, Mr. Greenspan was perceived within the Federal Reserve, according to some officials, as more skeptical than his colleagues about whether higher rates were needed to slow the economy's strong growth. Consumer spending had slowed some and a large buildup in inventories developed during the second quarter, signaling a possible slowdown that might make a rate increase unnecessary.
But some evidence has emerged in the last few days that spending remains strong, notably a Commerce Department report on Tuesday that housing starts had jumped 4.7 percent in July.
While Mr. Greenspan can act on his own to raise rates, and did so as recently as April 18, the committee's vote on July 6 to give him that discretion seemed a vote of confidence amid reports suggesting he had lost some influence with the group.
Earlier this year, the panel had repeatedly raised interest rates at regularly scheduled meetings, without explicitly giving Mr. Greenspan the discretion to do so on his own in the periods between meetings. Some analysts interpreted this as a signal that the Fed's other top policy makers, without a discussion or a vote, had taken from Mr. Greenspan much of his authority.
Federal Reserve officials vehemently denied this at the time, saying that Mr. Greenspan had not lost any of his influence.
 
Playing Down Dissent

 
 J. Alfred Broaddus Jr., the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, has been the most frequent dissenter pressing for faster interest rate increases, according to today's minutes and the minutes of previous meetings. But in an interview in the spring, he strongly stated his view that disagreements over policy should not be interpreted as a lack of confidence in Mr. Greenspan, pointing out that dissents also occurred under previous Fed chairmen like Arthur F. Burns, G. William Miller and Paul A. Volcker.
"I've been watching these meetings since 1973," said Mr. Broaddus, who attended the gatherings as a senior Fed economist before he became president of the Richmond Fed last year. "I don't see anything different now -- there were sharp disagreements under Burns, there were sharp disagreements under Miller and there were sharp disagreements under Volcker."
Federal Reserve officials are prohibited from giving interviews a week before and after each panel meeting and were not available for comment today.
The Open Market Committee raised the Federal funds rate by a fourth of a percentage point at its meetings on Feb. 4 and March 22, and by half a point at its meeting on May 17. Mr. Greenspan raised the Federal Funds rate by a fourth of a percentage point on April 18, acting on his own authority after consulting by telephone with the other governors of the Federal Reserve Board and with the presidents of the 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks.
 
A Previous Increase

 
 Before this week's rise in the discount rate, the Federal Reserve Board had also raised that rate, also by half a percentage point, in May.
At the July meeting, the panel voted 10 to 1 to approve the decision to give Mr. Greenspan the discretionary authority, according to the minutes released today. The only dissenting vote came from Mr. Broaddus.
The dissent appears to have reflected Mr. Broaddus's general view that interest rates were too low to prevent inflation from rising again. Mr. Broaddus also dissented at the March 22 meeting of the panel, contending that an increase of a fourth of a percentage point was inadequate.
The minutes of the July meeting stated, "Mr. Broaddus dissented because he believed that additional near-term tightening was necessary to contain inflation."

HEADLINE: Judge Faults Affirmative Action at Law School

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex., Aug. 19

 BODY:
A Federal judge ruled today that the admissions policy used by the University of Texas law school in 1992 to encourage the enrollment of minority students had unconstitutionally discriminated against white applicants.
The ruling by U.S. District Judge Sam Sparks came in a lawsuit by four whites who had sought admission to the Austin law school in 1992. Two were rejected, one was admitted and one was put on a waiting list. 
 In today's ruling, the judge ordered the university to pay $1 each to the plaintiffs, Cheryl Hopwood, Douglas Carvell, Kenneth Elliott and David Rogers, and said that those who had been rejected and put on the waiting list were entitled to re-apply to the law school for the 1995-96 school year without paying further fees.
In finding the admissions policy had violated the constitutional prohibition against race discrimination, Judge Sparks objected to a separate evaluation of whites and minorities.
"Commitment to affirmative action programs in educational institutions does not imply that the individual rights of non-minorities should fall by the wayside or be ignored," he wrote.
But Judge Sparks said the university had produced evidence that the four plaintiffs would probably not have been admitted even under a constitutional standard.
Terral Smith, lawyer for the four, said proving they would have been admitted was "an impossible burden."
The lawyer said the plaintiffs would probably appeal to seek an order admitting them to the law school.
The law school has already said it is changing its admissions system, beginning with the class that enters in 1995.
Under the old policy, more than half of each first-year law school class was admitted on the basis of their combined grades and law school exam scores.
Discretionary factors, including race, gender, age and economic background, were used to evaluate the rest of the applicants. Among that group, minority students were compared with other minorities, and whites with whites.
"Using the color of an applicant's skin to limit the degree of individual comparison between the races neither serves societal goals nor sufficiently protects individual rights under our Constitution," the judge said.
The new admissions policy does not include such a separate evaluation, said Barry Burgdorf, a lawyer for the university.

HEADLINE: THE HEALTH CARE DEBATE: THE EMPLOYER MANDATE;
Big Companies Use Little-Company Arguments to Resist Insuring Workers

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
Over and over, giant corporations that employ low-wage workers offer the same reason for withholding company-paid health insurance from them: Millions of qualified applicants are willing to take the jobs without it.
While much of the debate over uninsured workers has focused on those at small companies, more than 4.5 million of the 22 million working Americans without any health insurance are employed at big corporations like Bank of America, Wal-Mart, Pepsico, J. C. Penney and Dayton-Hudson, surveys show. These corporations are lobbying hard against any bill that would require them to insure all their workers. 
 "If there were a tighter labor market with fewer people looking for work, we might have to offer health insurance," said Norman Snell, a senior vice president at Bank of America, with headquarters in Los Angeles. "But no one has run into that problem in California, which has so many college students who are potential part-time employees."
Bank of America has 95,000 employees, of whom 20,000 are uninsured by the bank. Most of them are tellers and bank clerks who work fewer than 20 hours a week and earn under $8 an hour, two common characteristics of the uninsured at big companies. Many work for a few weeks or months, and then quit, another common characteristic.
Mr. Snell argues that insuring these workers would add substantially to the bank's costs and that profits would suffer, hurting shareholders.
 
Insurance From Wages
 But the cost-and-profit argument often masks a more important issue, wages. Studies show that most companies that offer health insurance finance as much as 85 percent of the company's contribution by limiting or cutting back wages. That is hard to do, however, for workers who earn only the minimum wage of $4.25 an hour or a dollar or two above it.
The big companies that employ such workers would have to raise prices to cover the cost, or take the money out of profits, says James G. Waters, a benefits specialist at Towers, Perrin, a management consulting firm.
"I don't see that paying for health insurance will make a profitable company unprofitable," Mr. Waters said. "But it is so antithetical to the American ethic, to penalize profitability."
So most Americans who earn less than $7 an hour do not have health insurance, at least not from the companies that employ them, Labor Department surveys show.
"We are perpetuating the notion that the employer is giving something to the employee, when in fact there is a tradeoff between wages and benefits," said Robert D. Reischauer, director of the Congressional Budget Office, which evaluates the health insurance bills. "When you get down to the minimum wage or near it, then the tradeoff has to come in the form of higher prices or out of profits."
As a solution, companies like Pizza Hut Inc., which is the fast-food division of Pepsico, and Dayton-Hudson, which owns Marshall Field and other department stores, do endorse Federal subsidies to pay health insurance premiums for low-income people. "I would favor using general tax revenue to pay for subsidies for the working poor," said Edwin H. Wingate, a Dayton-Hudson vice president.
Without the subsidies, health insurance largely paid by the companies for all employees would be disastrous for profits, says Robert Doughty, a spokesman for Pizza Hut Inc. Now, Pizza Hut pays $23 million a year for health insurance for its 11,000 full-time workers. The remaining 120,000, who are part-timers working 20 hours a week or fewer for the minimum wage, or just above it, are ineligible for any company-paid health insurance until they have been on the job six months. Few remain that long.
"Under President Clinton's original plan, we would have been required to insure everyone from day one of their employment," Mr. Doughty said, "and our cost would go up to between $120 and $200 million a year, which would have cut in half our $370 million profit last year."
Without challenging the mathematics involved in this assertion, David Card, a Princeton University labor economist, says that company-paid health insurance for low-wage workers might result in cost savings, just as raising the minimum wage often brings savings that offset the cost of the higher wage. For example, Mr. Card says, higher pay makes workers more reluctant to quit. So turnover declines and with it the cost of constantly training new workers.
Pizza Hut became embroiled in the debate over health insurance after supporters of a health bill that would require employers to insure all their workers noted that the fast food chain insured its workers abroad, while declining to cover all its employees in the United States. Germany, in particular, was cited. While acknowledging that the assertion was correct, Mr. Doughty argued that the high cost of benefits abroad had forced up pizza prices overseas, and that the German operation rarely had a profitable year.
In the United States, while Bank of America in California argues that it can recruit qualified part-timers without offering health insurance, Chase Manhattan Bank in New York says that it cannot.
Chase classifies only 1,500 of its 20,000 American employees, most of them in New York, as part-timers ineligible for company-paid health insurance in their first year on the job. Although Chase and Bank of America share the problem of staffing their branches with extra people in peak hours, Chase employs a much smaller percentage of part-timers to do so.
"Our whole concept is to hire and retain the best people, and in New York you have to offer health insurance to do that," said John Farrell, a Chase senior vice president. "We have flexible work arrangements, but that does not cause us to have many part-timers."
Chase has already built health insurance into its pay package for low-wage workers. They earn $8 an hour or more, in addition to the company's payment of 80 percent of the health insurance premium, Mr. Farrell said.
Bank of America pays many tellers and clerks in the $8-an-hour range, Mr. Snell said, but makes no payment for health insurance. If the bank had to pay the insurance premium, too, wages might have to be held back, he said. "The market is too competitive to raise bank fees," he added.
Most of the 4.5 million uninsured Americans employed at companies with more than 1,000 employees earn less than $7 an hour, the Labor Department reports. They represent 21 percent of the nearly 22 million working Americans without health insurance, according to the Labor Department and the Employee Benefit Research Institute, which base their data mostly on surveys completed last year.
By comparison, 7.6 million of the uninsured workers, or 35 percent, are employed at small companies, which are those with fewer than 25 workers. An additional 5.7 million workers at big companies, while not insured by these companies, do have health insurance through the policies of a spouse or a relative at another job.
In their lobbying efforts, small companies have argued through their trade associations that their profits are too marginal to afford health insurance for all their employees, or that the companies have too few workers to negotiate low group insurance premiums.
The big companies do have the negotiating clout. But apart from warning about lower profits and higher prices, they have taken a different tack. Many argue that their low-wage part-time workers are often healthy young people seeking to earn some extra money by working for a while, but are uninterested in health insurance.
"Minimum-wage workers are not who you think they are; they are largely teen-agers living at home and glad to have a job while going to school," said Jeffrey Joseph, a vice president at the United States Chamber of Commerce.
Citing a Labor Department study, the Chamber says that 30 percent of all Americans earning the minimum wage are teen-agers and 20 percent of all minimum-wage workers come from households with incomes of $50,000 or more.
The unions take a different view of low-wage workers, particularly the United Food and Commercial Workers, whose members include thousands of part-timers. Rather than the minimum wage, the union's members earn $7 an hour at supermarkets like A.&P., Pathmark and Safeway. All of these supermarket employees also have company health insurance.
"For lower-paid workers, a job with benefits is extremely important," said Gregory Denier, a union spokesman, disputing the Chamber of Commerce's claim. But to help offset the cost of the health insurance, the union has agreed to hold back on wage gains.

HEADLINE: Excerpts From News Conference Announcing Policy on Refugees

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 19

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from President Clinton's news conference, including his opening statement and the questions and answers that followed, as transcribed by the Federal Information Systems Corporation, a private transcription service:
 Good afternoon. In recent weeks, the Castro regime has encouraged Cubans to take to the sea in unsafe vessels to escape their nation's internal problems. In so doing, it has risked the lives of thousands of Cubans and several have already died in their efforts to leave. This action is a cold-blooded attempt to maintain the Castro grip on Cuba and to divert attention from his failed Communist policies. He is trying to export to the United States the political and economic crisis he has created in Cuba, in defiance of the democratic tide flowing throughout this region.
 
 Let me be clear: the Cuban Government will not succeed in any attempt to dictate American immigration policy. The United States will do everything within its power to insure that Cuban lives are saved and that the current outflow of refugees is stopped. Today I have ordered that illegal refugees from Cuba will not be allowed to enter the United States. Refugees rescued at sea will be taken to our naval base at Guantanamo while we explore the possibility of other safe havens within the region.
 To enforce this policy, I have directed the Coast Guard to continue its expanded effort to stop any boat illegally attempting to bring Cubans to the United States. The United States will detain, investigate and, if necessary, prosecute Americans who take to the sea to pick up Cubans. Vessels used in such activities will be seized.
 I want to compliment the Coast Guard and the Immigration and Naturalization Service for their efforts, and I want to thank Florida's officials, including Governor Chiles and the Florida Congressional delegation, for their help in protecting and saving the lives of Cubans who seek to escape the regime.
 
Crime Bill Compromise
 Now I'd like to speak just for a moment about the crime bill. In the last week, I have fought hard to put this crime bill back on track. After extensive talks with members of both parties, I have indicated my support for strengthening the provisions that require sexual predators to report to the police and make sure their communities are notified of their presence.
 And I support cutting overall spending in the bill by 10 percent. These cuts will insure that every dollar authorized in the bill will actually be paid for -- not with new taxes and not by diverting dollars from other needed programs, but, as I have always insisted, with the savings we will gain from reducing the size of the Federal Government by over a quarter of a million people over the next six years, to its lowest size in over 30 years, since President Kennedy was here. And all these historic savings will go back to the American people to make their streets and their homes, their schools safer.
 I have insisted that we keep the most profoundly important elements of the crime bill -- to keep it tough by putting 100,000 police officers on the street, building more prisons, putting violent criminals away for good, by making "three strikes, you're out" the law of the land, and by other stronger provisions on sentencing.
 And we're going to keep it smart with the sensible crime prevention programs that steer our kids away from drugs and gangs and give them things to say yes to. The crime bill must ban handguns for juveniles and take deadly assault weapons off our streets. Even though we've come under intense pressure from forces that will apparently say anything to take the assault weapons out of the bill, I have refused to do so.
 Let's keep in mind what this crime bill is all about. It's about removing fear from our streets, our schools and our homes. Innocent Americans should not have to fear being preyed upon, as so many do today. Innocent children should not have to fear losing their childhoods, as so many do today. We owe it to the American people that do the work and pay the bills in this country to make sure that people who commit crime get caught, that those who are guilty get convicted and that those who are convicted serve their time. We also owe it to them to do whatever we can to prevent crime in the first place. That's what the police and the prevention programs are all about.
 That's why it is so important and why I have worked so hard to make sure that we do not turn this crime issue into yet another Washington partisan issue. This is a grass-roots, mainstream, nonpartisan issue, and so it should remain. It must be an American crime bill. We have worked hard on it, and I call upon Congress to pass it without delay.
 
U.S. Policy Toward Cuba
 Q. Mr. President, on behalf of all the press corps, we want to wish you a happy birthday.
 A. Thank you.
 Q. And now ----
 A. Well, you could all do a lot to make it happy -- that is not a guilt trip; feel no pressure. Thank you.
 Q. Mr. President, in the last 35 years, we've had an embargo against Cuba. . . . What is the problem with taking a few small, albeit brave steps to negotiate a possible movement toward democracy with Cuba? We've dealt with many Communist countries through the last 35 years, and we're dealing with them now.
 A. There aren't many left. I support the embargo and I support the Cuban Democracy Act, which was passed in 1992. And I do not believe we should change our policy there. The fundamental problem is democracy is sweeping the world; democracy and freedom are sweeping our hemisphere. In the Caribbean alone and in Central and South America, in all of this region, there are only two countries now not democratically governed with open societies and open economies.
 The real problem is the stubborn refusal of the Castro regime to have an open democracy and an open economy, and I think the policies we are following will hasten the day when that occurs. . . .
 Q. Mr. President, recognizing that you're slowing down the process, do people fleeing Cuba still get automatic entry to the United States as political refugees if they're not criminals or ill?
 A. No. The people leaving Cuba will not be permitted to come to the United States. They will be sent to safe havens. . . . The people who reach here will be apprehended and will be treated like others. They will be -- their cases will be reviewed, and those who qualify can stay, and those who don't will not be permitted to. They will be now treated like others who come here. . . .
 Q. Mr. President, under the law it has always been clear that Cuban refugees had a certain priority on staying here, and the policy, of course, was then that anybody who got here got to stay. What restraints are you operating under in terms of the law in changing this policy? Are you likely, sir, to be sued over this?
 A. No. . . . The Cuban Adjustment Act will continue to be the law of the land, but we are doing our best within that -- we will detain the Cubans who come here now. They will not simply be released into the population at large. And we will review all their cases in light of the applicable law, including the Cuban Adjustment Act. . . .
 Q. Can you give us some more details? Are these people going to be taken to Guantanamo? What kind of strain might this place on our naval forces, the Coast Guard? Already we're being told that drug interdiction is being cut back. And can you respond to criticism already from Bob Dole and Newt Gingrich? In particular, Mr. Gingrich said that your new policy is appalling, it's an example of mixed morality, and that he thinks it is illegal under the act.
 A. Well, first let me answer the factual questions. The refugees, those who are fleeing, will be taken first to Guantanamo, where we will seek safe havens for them. That is plainly not illegal under international law, nor do we believe it is illegal under the Cuban Adjustment Act.
 Secondly, as to whether it is immoral, I just would say it is my belief that the American people, and that the Cuban-American people, and the people of Florida, but the people of the entire United States, do not want to see another Mariel boat lift. They do not want to see Cuba dictate our immigration policy. They do not want to see Mr. Castro able to export his political and economic problems to the United States.
 Now that is what is plainly being set up. We have gone through that once. We had 120,000 people sent to this country as a deliberate attempt -- not because they themselves initially wanted to flee -- they were encouraged to flee; they were pushed out. We had jails open, we had mental hospitals open, all in an attempt to export all the problems of Cuba to the United States. We tried it that way once. It was wrong then and it's wrong now, and I'm not going to let it happen again. . . .
 
Reviving the Crime Bill
 Q. President Clinton, previously you said that the crime bill was something that you supported, that you wanted to sign as it was. Now you're saying you can take 10 percent out of it. Why shouldn't the American people believe that there's still a lot of fat that should come out of it?
 A. First of all, any time you start -- I've never seen a bill that started new programs that you couldn't cut some and maintain its fundamental integrity. I said that crime bill was a strong and good bill as it was, and it was a strong and good bill. But one of the things that happened in conference that I think has been largely overlooked is that, in an attempt to get as much money as possible for police officers and law enforcement and for prisons and for border patrol, funds were appropriated or were authorized in the crime bill that came out of conference in an amount greater than we could provide in the trust fund.
 Keep in mind the great beauty of this crime bill is it's the first major program in American history that's being financed entirely by reducing the size of the Federal bureaucracy and taking all the savings from the Federal Government and putting it in a trust fund to help grass-roots Americans get better control over their own lives. The practical impact of what we are doing by cutting 10 percent of this will be to be able to put everything that's left into the trust fund. So in terms of real dollars, I believe there will be more money actually appropriated and spent for tough law enforcement and for police officers.
 And I believe that all the fundamental important things in the prevention strategy will be maintained at a very high level and dramatically higher than now. The principles of the bill are intact. It's the biggest increase in police in the history of the country. It's the toughest increase in punishment in the history of the country. It's the biggest increase in prevention programs in the history of the country. . . .
 I'm not a member of the Congress. They have to work out all the details. If they'd produced this bill out of the conference, I would have happily supported this as I did the other one.
 Q. Were you just giving in to politics then by accepting the original here?
 A. Now, that's one of those questions designed to spoil your birthday. Because it's something else designed to confuse the American people about what really goes on up here. The President is not a member of the Congress. The Congress made a decision that they had a bill that they all wanted. They accommodated the interests as best they could. It met all my fundamental criteria -- assault weapons ban, ban on handgun ownership by kids, tougher penalties, longer imprisonment, more prevention. So does this bill. . . .
 
Reaction of Cuban-Americans
 Q. Mr. President, you say that you are not going to allow Fidel Castro to dictate U.S. immigration policy, but hasn't he just done that by forcing you to reverse three decades of a policy? And secondly, what do you say to Cuban-Americans, especially in Florida, who feel betrayed by this change in policy?
 A. Well, I believe that most Cuban-Americans want us to be very firm. The Cuban-Americans that I know, without regard to their party, supported the Cuban Democracy Act, and they remember how awful it was for the United States when the Mariel boat lift occurred. They remembered what it did in this country and how -- the feelings that it generated in this country. And I do not believe they want another Mariel boat lift, and I do not believe we can afford to do that.
 And so my own view is that most Cuban-Americans will support what we're trying to do and wish us to be firm. . . .
 Q. By telling Cubans to basically to stay home and at least temporarily to stomach conditions there, does that make it incumbent on you to be more active in seeking to oust Castro?
 A. Well, what we are telling Cubans is that we have a provision for their coming to the United States through in-country processing, and at least as of this date, we have no evidence that the Castro Government has done anything to discourage Cubans from coming to the in-country processing, applying for the visas if they're eligible to come here, and getting them. . . .
 
'Keep Working' on Health Bill
 Q. Mr. President, one of your fellow Democrats in the Senate, Sam Nunn of Georgia, said yesterday that it would be months, if not years, before a health care reform bill is produced, and the Congressional Budget Office said that a possible moderate compromise didn't cost out. There's a growing feeling in Washington that this health care crusade is hopelessly bogged down in Congress at this point. What is your view of the situation?
 A. That they should keep working at it. That if we don't move now, there's a chance that it won't happen at all. You know, the congressional timetable is often different from the American timetable. I mean, it took seven years to pass the Brady bill and seven years to pass family leave, but for 60 years, people have acknowledged that not covering all Americans and having no system for dealing with the explosive costs and the inequalities in the health care system were a problem.
 They have reached a significant crisis stage here, with five million more Americans losing their health insurance in the last five years alone, with the costs exploding in the last 12 years, and I believe that the time has come to deal with this.
 Now, Senator Nunn simply observed what I think is clearly a fact, which is that in the Senate there is unlimited debate and you can have unlimited amendments. But a lot of these issues do need to be worked through. I think that the comments Senator Kennedy and Senator Mitchell made today about the fact that this bipartisan group was at least attempting to work with them and, in the process of so attempting, finding out how hard it is -- it's easy to stand on the sideline and lob brickbats at these efforts, and quite another thing to produce your own effort. But their comment made me believe that there is still a chance that people will work together and resolve this. . . .
 
Ban on Assault Weapons
 Q. Mr. President, back to the crime bill. If the approach you're offering, the changes you're offering now, does not produce enough votes to pass the bill, will you under any circumstances agree to sever the assault weapon ban for a separate vote in the House and Senate?
 A. I won't agree to that because I think it's a mistake. And let me say -- I don't want to overly comment on it, but let me try to describe what the problem is. The bill has already passed the House, but in the Senate, as you know, we could have 55, 56, 57, 59 votes for that bill in the Senate and it could still be filibustered, and we should not permit that to happen. . . .
 
An Ambitious Agenda
 Q. Mr. President, I hate to ask you one of those questions that might spoil a birthday again, but in light of the problems that you have been having up on Capitol Hill, many people are wondering if changing your communications strategy, shuffling your staff might not be really addressing the problem, that perhaps -- I was wondering if you've thought about this -- that as a President elected with 43 percent, you may be trying to do too much, too fast, and Democrats on Capitol Hill may be trying to take too much of a partisan advantage of having control of the entire Government and perhaps exceeding your mandate?
 A. Well, first, I don't want the Democrats to take partisan advantage. I just want us to get what's necessary for the country done. I do not believe the country believes that we should sit still up here. And for all your talk about trouble, let me remind you that every objective survey says that in 1993, this Administration got more support from Congress than any Administration since World War II except President Eisenhower in 1953, when he had a less ambitious agenda, and President Johnson in 1965, when he had a bigger mandate and more support from the Congress. So I think we're doing quite well with the Congress if you look at it in any kind of historic pattern.
 Now, I realize the fights and the conflicts and the delays endure more than the achievements, but we reversed Reaganomics. We passed an economic program that was part of a strategy that has given us three years of deficit reduction for the first time since Truman, over four million jobs. We have the most advances in trade than we've had in a generation in the last year and a half. This economic program is working. We broke seven years of gridlock with the Brady bill. We passed Nafta, which was deader than a doornail when I became President. We revived it and passed it. . . .
 But I believe what I have to do is to keep trying to change things. Any time you try to provoke as much change as I have, you are going to have resistance, and you will be criticized. Is it more difficult that I had 43 percent of the vote? Perhaps it is. But I think you can make another argument, which was that 62 percent of the American people voted for fundamental change. . . .
 If anything, I would say that I've been most disappointed, looking back, not so much in my inability to get things done -- because once people look at the list, it's a very long and impressive list -- but I haven't been as successful in changing the way it works; that is, in trying to get the Democrats and Republicans to reach across to each other in good faith and work through these things. That's why I think this crime bill could be an important thing. It would be a way of people in both parties saying we're putting you first, for a change -- not ourselves. . . .
 
No Criticism for the Fed
 Q. Mr. President, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates again this week. Some Democrats are saying that it could cause an economic slowdown. How many more rate increases will you take before you also criticize the Fed?
 A. Well, when the Federal Reserve raised rates this week, the chairman, Mr. Greenspan, said that he thought that this would be sufficient for a time. The truth is that our economic strategy has produced more rapid growth than they thought it would and that we thought it would. We are even doing better than we thought we would. We've got over four million jobs already in the last year and a half, and we've got rapid growth in the economy, dramatic new investments in the private sector, so they are worried about inflation.
 I -- when it is apparent to me that the drag on the economy will be more about slowing the economy down than stopping inflation, I will do what I can to influence that policy. But I think my policy of letting them do their job and having me do mine has worked out rather well. . . .
 
Mexico and the Middle East
 Q. Mr. President, happy birthday. Next Sunday, Mexico is going to have presidential elections. Can you give us your assessment? What do you think? What do you expect? And what is going to be the impact in the relations of Mexico and the United States? Do you expect continuity?
 A. I expect the elections to be free, open and fair, and I expect them to produce a result which will be accepted by the people of Mexico. And I expect the United States to continue its deepening friendship with Mexico. I think that our relationships are growing. I think in spite of the political changes and the economic difficulties of Mexico in the last two years, we have had great success. I think Nafta clearly was a great success if you look at the economic benefits to the United States and what has happened. So I'm looking forward very optimistically to the future with Mexico.
 Q. Mr. President, on the Middle East, sir, progress continues between Israel and the Palestinians but there's still violence. I wondered, sir, if you have an assessment on that. Is there any update on the Syrian front? Have you heard recently from President Assad? And also, has any progress been made in countering worldwide terrorism?
 A. You asked me a lot of questions, there. Let me answer -- try to answer them all. I believe we are still on a path of steady progress in the hope of achieving an agreement that resolves the differences between Israel and Syria. Serious problems remain, but I would say significant advances are being made.
 With regard to the Palestinian agreement, I think everyone always knew there would be some operational difficulties because the P.L.O. had -- to be fair to them -- never been in charge of a country. That is, they had never had to operate a government and to deal with all the mundane and maybe sometimes even boring day-to-day problems that, unless they're properly managed, you can't keep a society together. I think we're making some headway there. I don't want to minimize the difficulties, but I do not expect them to be so great as to derail what we're doing.
 
Clinton's Wish List
 Q. What stirs within you as you celebrate another birthday? And if you could have three wishes fulfilled today, what would those three wishes be?
 A. Well, I woke up this morning just grateful to be here. That's what I'm feeling. I'm grateful to be alive, grateful to have my health, grateful to have my family, grateful to have the chance to serve. And you know, I like the tough fight, so this is an exhilarating period for me. I like the big challenges. I think we're all put on this earth to try to make a difference.
 If I had three wishes, I would wish for the crime bill to pass -- one. I would wish that I would make more progress on the way we do things around here as well as on the substance, because if we can open our minds and hearts to each other and play a little less politics, we can solve the health care problem, too, and other things. And I would wish that I won't have to give up my whole vacation -- because I still have dreams of breaking 80 on the golf course before I'm 50. . . .
 Thank you very much.

HEADLINE: THE HEALTH CARE DEBATE;
Excerpts From the Senate Debate on Revisions in the Health Care System

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 19

 BODY:
For much of this week, Senate Democrats have repeatedly argued that Congress should pass a health insurance overhaul that provides all Americans with coverage equal to what Congress itself enjoys under the Federal Employees Health Benefits program.
Republicans have just as consistently replied that the Federal plan is nothing extraordinary and dismissed the argument as demagogic. But the strategy of the Democrats, played out for the C-Span television audience, has clearly annoyed their opponents. 
 The Federal employees' program provides about nine million workers with a choice of various private insurance programs, with the Government typically contributing 72 percent of the cost of premiums and employees 28 percent -- close to the national average. Bills sponsored by Republicans and Democrats alike would allow people in the private sector to join the plan, though the conditions for doing so would vary.
This morning, two Democrats, Senators Paul Wellstone of Minnesota and Harry Reid of Nevada, followed the Senate's required form of debate and began a friendly -- and calculated -- dialogue on the subject as a challenge to Senator John W. Warner, Republican of Virginia. Eventually, several Democrats took their credit-card-sized insurance cards from their wallets to wave them in the air. At one point, Mr. Wellstone asked Mr. Warner if he had a card.
Reaching into his hip pocket, Mr. Warner replied, "I'll have to check." But referring to the Democrats' proposals, he added, "I know one thing: this plan will take every last dollar I've got in this wallet."

Following are excerpts from today's exchange, the 10th day of the debate in the Senate, as transcribed by The New York Times from a broadcast on C-Span.

WARNER I freely admit the following: My father was a doctor, a very prominent, a very successful physician here in northern Virginia and the nation's capital. And I admit, Madam President, if I'd had enough brains I would have been a doctor, but here I am today.
 
WELLSTONE . . . I disagree with the Senator from Virginia. I think he has more than enough brains.
 
WARNER But I learned at my father's knee several things about medicine, and I'd like to pose them to my good friend in the form of a question. What we've done is transformed this magnificent chamber into an operating room. We're like so many physicians, bending over this patient, ready to take the scalpel and make a major incision into a system which has served this country for some 200 years, which has served 80-plus percent of our people quite adequately.
Now does the system have problems? Yes, it does have some problems. And we have been dealing with them, ostensibly, here for a few days. But I think we've done little more than a pedicure -- clipped a nail here and polished a little bit there. We haven't gotten into the problem in terms of how it's to be paid for, the balance between further government intervention in the private sector. Those are the major issues. . . .
Time and time and time we have rejected diagnosis after diagnosis. This thing's becoming almost like a "M*A*S*H" comedy, and that's not what the American public wants. They want answers. And I say to my good friend, when the practicing doctors and the patients reach this type of situation where we find ourselves in today, they go and get a second opinion. That's dead-rock practice in medicine today, a second opinion. And I ask my good friend, is it not time to get a second opinion? And that opinion, in my judgment, can only be rendered by the people of the United States of America. . . .
 
MADAM PRESIDENT (BOXER) The Senator from Minnesota does have the floor and is entitled to answer the question at some point.
 
WARNER That is correct, Madam President. I get that message, and that's the message I'm trying to send to my friend, that it's time we get a second opinion and come back next year and commit, although we cannot bind the next Congress, commit the two-thirds of us who will be here.
 
MADAM PRESIDENT Does the Senator from Minnesota understand the question by the Senator from Virginia?
 
WARNER Madam President, he understands the question.
 
WELLSTONE Madam President, I certainly do understand the question. Having been a teacher for many years, I'm very familiar with long questions, and my colleague from Virginia is his usual articulate self. Let me just simply respond very briefly and then go on with the second opinion that I'm now going to present on the Mainstream proposal, because I think we should have a debate about ideas and policy proposals, and just simply say to my colleague from Virginia that I smile a little bit to myself about second opinions because health care, universal health care coverage, is an idea whose time has come over and over and over again in our country, going all the way back to before World War I. So since we have been debating this question as a nation for well over a half a century, and since we are really almost alone among the ranks of the advanced economies in the world in our failure to figure out how to finance and deliver health care for all of our citizens -- high quality care, which I know your father would have insisted on -- it seems to me that we've had plenty of time for debate, discussion and second opinions.
We've had many committee hearings here, and there comes a time in public life where you step up to the plate. I agree with my colleague, I'd like to get to the core of this and go after the tough issues, and you'd vote. That's what we're here for, is to vote.
 
REID Would the Senator from Minnesota yield?
 
WELLSTONE I'd be pleased to yield to my colleague from Nevada, and I also just want to remind my colleague, since I know we want to go to amendments, that I want to make sure that I do have time to present an analysis of the Mainstream group proposals because I want that to be a matter of record, but I'd certainly be pleased to yield.
 
REID The Senator has the floor and the Senator can speak as long as the Senator wishes under the present frame of debate. I would ask the Senator from Minnesota, is it not true that during this Congress there's been over 80 hearings held on various health care bills by the Finance Committee and the Education and Labor Committee? Is that true, over 80 committee hearings?
 
WELLSTONE That is correct.
 
REID Isn't it true, I say to my friend from Minnesota, isn't it true that during this period of time there have been hundreds of witnesses testify before those two committees?
 
WELLSTONE That is correct.
 
REID Isn't it true that one of the basic elements that we're trying to establish, as indicated by the Senator from Minnesota, is the fact that we have been through over 50 years of debate, off and on, during this? And during the past several years debate all year long. We've been through six or seven Presidents that have talked about universal health coverage, isn't that true?
 
WELLSTONE That is correct.
 
REID And, Mr. President, I reach in my wallet here and I can flip through this wallet, and I have a card here that says, "Government-Wide Service Benefit Plan, Blue Cross-Blue Shield Federal Employee Program." Now isn't it true, Mr. President, that there's been -- isn't that true, I say to my friend from Minnesota, that we've had debate on this floor for over two weeks trying to indicate to the American public and to the United States Senate that we're not trying to do anything very difficult or elaborate, we're trying to give the American public the same coverage that we have, isn't that true?
 
WELLSTONE That is correct.
 
REID Now isn't it true, I say to my friend from Minnesota -- although you may have some different plan; I have a plan that has Blue Cross-Blue Shield but that I can go to, because we have a retail pharmacy program under the plan that I have, I can go to any pharmacy that's a member, and almost all of them around this area have that also, and I can get my prescriptions for, I think, $5. I think no matter what the prescription is, $5. Is the Senator from Minnesota aware that I have a plan like this, that I'm trying to get so the American public still has the same opportunity as I have?
 
WELLSTONE Well, I would say to my colleague, and I thank him for the question and I would be more than willing to take some other questions as well, because I think the Senator from Virginia has raised an important question, before I go on with the other analysis, and let me just respond in two ways. Number one, yes, I mean, to talk about we really need to slow all this up, we need another second opinion, ignores almost 75 years of debate and discussion about this. And second of all, of course your perspective about whether or not we need to stop or we need to block or we need to filibuster or whatever it is that we do, depends upon the situation of yourself and your family. And if, in fact, you've reached a point where you don't have insurance, or you're under-insured, or you're terrified of losing your coverage because you might lose your job or because of a sickness, then from your point of view it is really important that this doesn't get put off yet once again.
And finally, on your point about the coverage that we have, I'm quite well aware of that and I believe yesterday the Senator from Pennsylvania, the Senator from South Dakota and others, the Senator from Massachusetts, spoke eloquently to this. I mean, I will have an amendment. I'm going to be on the floor all day today, till I can get my turn to introduce the amendment. I want senators on record that this health care reform bill that we pass should provide people with a health care plan, high quality care, comparable to what we have. And I will -- and we will have a vote on this.
 
REID Can I ask one last question before I no longer intrude in the Senator from Minnesota's time? One last question?
 
WELLSTONE I'd say to my colleague, you're not intruding on my time.
 
REID Are you aware that -- and I wasn't until recently, frankly -- but are you aware that the card that we carry around, that I carry around, has helpful telephone numbers? I mean, it is so easy for me, if I have a question about my health care, I can call here for customer service. . . . How many people out in this public, the American public, do you think have the same benefits that I have?
 
WELLSTONE Well, I would say to the Senator from Nevada that he just emphasizes the most important point that can be emphasized in this debate, which is people are saying to us over and over and over again: You are our elected representatives, and we believe that what you have decided is really a good health care plan for yourselves and your loved ones, that that ought to be the standard that you set in pushing forward a reform bill. Make that available to us! We are your constituents!
 
DASCHLE Would the Senator yield on that point, because I think the Senator from Minnesota and the Senator from Nevada make a very important point. The Senator from Nevada talked about the back of his card. Here's my card. And the back of my card is the same as the Senator from Nevada's. I have Blue Cross-Blue Shield as well. Not only does it give a helpful number, it talks a lot about the standard benefits package. . . .
If I can ask a question of the Senator from Minnesota whether or not it is his view that all Americans ought to have a card like this?
 
WELLSTONE I say to my colleague from South Dakota: absolutely. . . .
 
KENNEDY Will the Senator yield? I think if we could hold up our cards here, these cards.
 
WELLSTONE I say to my colleague, I feel lonely. I do not have a card down here.

HEADLINE: Stocks Take 'Witching' In Stride, Ending Mixed

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
The stock market closed mixed but essentially unchanged yesterday, despite a "double witching hour" and fallout from the Federal Reserve's steep increase in interest rates earlier in the week.
Such witching-hour days, when options on stock indexes and individual stocks expire at the same time, usually lead to hectic sessions and many trading imbalances, as traders hurry to buy and sell stocks before their options expire. But the New York Stock Exchange reported no trading imbalances yesterday, and the trading volume of 279.7 million shares was below average. 
 Blue chips like J. P. Morgan and Coca-Cola fell, but conglomerates like General Electric and computer companies like I.B.M. rose. Over-the-counter stocks like Microsoft and Cisco Systems declined.
 
Insurer's Stock Tumbles
 Trading in some stocks was notable. Shares of 20th Century Industries, an insurance company, fell 3 5/8, to 12 3/4, after the California Supreme Court upheld a Government order for the company to pay $119 million in refunds. The company had $113 million in net income in 1993.
Quaker Oats fell 1/8, to 81 7/8, after rising sharply on Thursday on takeover rumors. But an analyst at Salomon Brothers said it was unlikely that Unilever, a rumored bidder, would attempt a takeover of Quaker.
The most active stock, with nearly 11 million shares traded, was Cisco, which fell 7/8, to 22 5/8. The company, which makes computer networking equipment, reported earnings that were somewhat below analysts' estimates. It reported a fourth-quarter profit of 34 cents a share, compared with 21 cents a share in the comparable period a year earlier.
Wall Street had expected Cisco to earn 35 cents a share. But traders often discount those estimates as conservative, so a company often must report a better-than-expected profit to get an increase in its share price.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond was unchanged, at 1005/32 . Its yield was also unchanged, at 7.49 percent.
The dollar was mixed but little changed against leading currencies. It rose to 98.65 Japanese yen from 98.57, but fell to 1.5396 German marks from 1.5440. It was unchanged against the British pound, at $1.549 to 1.
Commodity prices were basically unchanged, but gold futures contracts for September delivery rose $1.10, to $381.90 an ounce. The Commodity Research Bureau futures index fell 0.23 point, to 229.77, led by declines for unleaded gas, coffee and live hogs.
 
No Summer Rally
 A summer rally has not materialized, and Wall Street strategists who believe that the stock and bond markets are locked in wide trading ranges appear to be correct, especially after the Fed's increase in interest rates did little to shake the markets out of these ranges this week.
Since late June, the Dow Jones industrial average has fluctuated in a range of 3,600 to 3,800. Since early June, the bond market has been in a range where the long bond's yield has varied from 7.2 percent to 7.7 percent.
Yesterday, the Dow fell 0.32 point, to 3,755.11, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500 rose 0.51 point, to 463.68. The smaller-company Nasdaq composite index rose 0.26 point, to 742.43.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 0.32 point, to 255.81, with advancing stocks outnumbering those that declined by 1,157 to 917. The American Stock Exchange market value index rose 1.90 points, to 445.45.
Of the 30 component stocks that make up the Dow industrials, 15 fell, led by J. P. Morgan, which fell 1 1/8, to 63 1/4, mainly because a single unidentified investor sold 500,000 shares, or a third of the daily volume.
 Of the 500 component stocks that make up the S.& P. 500, 226 rose, led by General Electric, which rose 3/4, to 47 7/8, on no immediate news.
In Tokyo yesterday, the Nikkei index of 225 issues fell 350.07 points, or 1.68 percent, to 20,512.70. On Thursday, the index gained 38.21 points.

HEADLINE: Steel Gains in Home Building

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
For more than 50 years the American steel industry has been promoting its product for residential construction -- with a stunning lack of success. According to the National Association of Home Builders, as recently as 1990, 94 percent of new homes were built with wood framing, with concrete block the most frequently used alternative.
But things are changing. According to the American Iron and Steel Institute, an industry trade group, the number of steel-framed homes increased to 15,000 last year from 500 in 1992, with 75,000 projected this year. 
 The boomlet can largely be laid to simple economics. In the last year, the near exhaustion of old growth timber has become critical, sending the price of wood soaring and the quality of what is available into decline. Reluctantly, builders have begun looking for other alternatives, and some are switching to steel.
 
 
Nature's Role
 But acts of God have also played a role. The devastation left in Florida by Hurricane Andrew in August 1992, and by recent earthquakes in California, have highlighted the need for strong and flexible housing. And among larger buildings, steel-framed ones clearly did better than those made of wood or masonry.
Steelmakers who struggle with high fixed costs and highly cyclical markets in their traditional automotive, appliance and construction applications, see a much needed stable outlet. "There are 1.1 million to 1.8 million housing starts a year," said Richard Haws, manager for light construction at the Iron and Steel Institute. "Since each house uses five to six tons, it could be a huge market."
Still, a number of obstacles to wider use of steel remain, not the least of which is custom and habit. Though steel is strong, not flammable and impervious to termites or rot, in the past residential builders avoided it because they found it more difficult to cut and join.
 
 
Distribution Network
 However, high-rise use of steel has helped establish a manufacturing and distribution network for metal building studs and related material that is ready to expand -- and to help educate residential builders. Studs are the concealed vertical supports for the walls of a house, and are usually cut from two-by-fours.
As for cost, the price of 1,000 board feet of lumber went from about $300 last July to about $500 last December and is now about $400, according to Michael Carliner, an economist with the National Association of Home Builders. That puts steel, which once was twice as expensive as lumber, in a nearly competitive position, and has attracted builders who had signed contracts to build houses for a fixed price.
As for quality, structural timbers, boards 2 inches by 6 inches or larger, must be cut from dense, old-growth trees to have sufficient strength. But 90 percent of the old growth has been cut down, and much of what is left is protected for environmental reasons.
"The forest management practices of the last 40 to 50 years have exacerbated the problem," said Nels C. Johnson, a forest ecologist with the World Resources Institute in Washington. Wood products companies, he said, typically replace diverse natural forests with tree plantations, using one species of fast-growing tree.
This allows them to harvest the trees sooner, but the wood produced is less dense and less strong than that of old growth. Builders complain that wood from the smaller plantation trees is more likely to have excessive knots and is more prone to twisting and splitting.
"The quality of lumber has gotten a lot worse," said Jim McAleer, executive vice president of Kevin Scarborough Inc., a builder of single-family houses in southern New Jersey and Delaware. "It's green, it twists and has so many knot holes it looks like chipmunks have been running through it."
Officials of the American Forest and Paper Association, the lumber industry's principal trade group, conceded that builders have a perception of deteriorating quality in lumber.
 
 
'More Accurate Mix'
 In the past, the officials said, mills mixed higher-quality lumber with lower grades because there was little price difference. But since prices have risen, mills have been stricter about sorting. "You see a more accurate mix now," said Robert Glowinski, a vice president of the association. "But builders on the job site may be disappointed that the higher grades are not in there."
A lot of builders are thinking about alternative materials, although few have actually made the switch yet. "We surveyed our members and found that about 2 percent of them are using steel, but that 45 percent are thinking about it," Mr. Carliner of the home builders group said.
Another obstacle to the wider use of steel in housing is that most building codes are designed around a wood structure and the fractious companies that fabricate the lightweight studs that can replace lumber have been unable to agree on standards. Many builders are reluctant to deviate from established codes for fear that they will have to pay for additional engineering to have their houses certified as safe.
 
 
'Not Had Good Information'
 "We are not talking U. S. Steel or Bethlehem here; there are 100 little companies that buy the steel from them and do the fabrication," said Larry Zarker of the home builders association's research center. "They tend to fight with each other a lot and, as a result, the home building industry has not had good information."
To promote the use of metal studs in building homes, the Iron and Steel Institute and its members are holding joint seminars with the home builders association to teach builders, who are often small-business people with no research staff, the economics and mechanics of using steel. And they are donating material to build 200 houses in an area of Homestead, Fla., hard hit by Hurricane Andrew.
Edward R. diGirolamo, president of All American Steel Homes Inc., which is based in St. James, L.I., and sells steel framing, said many builders were concerned that switching from lumber to steel would disrupt their carefully honed production methods. "Their biggest concern is how it will affect their subcontractors," he said. "We know that we have to provide training as part of the package."
Building a house of steel does involve different techniques from using wood. Instead of a hammer and nails, framers use self-tapping strews and and electric drive gun. Driving the screws takes longer than hammering a nail, but because the studs are pre-punched for electrical and plumbing connections, less cutting is involved.
In fact, since steel framing is manufactured, builders can order the pieces cut to length, so there is less need to cut in the field and pre-assemble some part, such as roof trusses. Since wood comes in standard lengths, it has to be cut to fit on the job site. According to Allen Hershkowitz, a solid waste specialist with the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental organization in New York, as much as one-third of the wood used in a single family home is discarded as waste.
 
 
No Rust Problem
 Whatever the differences in framing techniques, steel industry officials and builders say the resulting house will look and feel like one constructed of wood. Since the steel studs are almost always made from galvanized sheet, rust is not an issue and some added insulation can compensate for the metal's greater heat conductivity. Because of their strength, steel studs can be spaced more widely than wood, so there is no interference with radio and television signals.
Steel is not the only alternative to studs sawed from logs. Small pieces of wood can be joined together with various glues to form what is known as engineered lumber. But engineered lumber costs more than ordinary wood, and its long-term advantages are yet to be proved.
Jim McAleer, for one, says his company plans to use nothing but steel framing on all its future projects. "We not getting into it to save money; at the moment it costs a little more," Mr. McAleer said. "The point is it produces a better product and we think it is the wave of the future."

HEADLINE: Bond Prices Track Dollar And End Flat

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were slightly mixed yesterday, tracing the dollar's course in the currency markets.
The dollar's early weakness caused the bond market to slump, and nearly erased all of the market's gains since the Federal Reserve increased interest rates on Tuesday. 
 Market analysts said trading was thin yesterday, with no motivation to push the market out of its recent pattern. High interest rates in Europe also kept buyers away, they said.
 
Varied Results
 The price of the 30-year bond was unchanged at 10056/32 , to yield 7.49 percent. In the shorter-maturity securities, trading was mixed. The three-month bill rate was up one basis point, to 4.54 percent, while the six-month issue was down two basis points, to 4.90 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
William Basa, a bond market analyst with McCarthy, Crisanti & Maffei Inc., said the half-point increase in interest rates on Tuesday should have helped the dollar, but did not.
Compounding matters, he said, is the political uncertainty in Washington and the fact that higher rates abroad are reducing the dollar's relative attractiveness.
One positive factor in the near term, he said, is the limited progress being made in the trade talks between the United States and Japan.
"Unfortunately," he said, "this is not just a yen problem, for the dollar index looks weak, as does the dollar versus the mark and Swiss franc."
 
Few Foreign Buyers Seen

 
 Eugene J. Sherman, director of research for M. A. Schapiro & Company, said he saw few price changes yesterday, with bonds bouncing around in thin trading.
"The dollar was the major issue," he said, "suggesting that foreign investors are reluctant to buy U.S. securities, fearing a decline in the price of those securities."
Mr. Sherman said that with the move of 50 basis points higher in the discount rate and Federal funds target rate on Tuesday, the market had set aside, for a time, its concern that the Fed would increase rates again in the months ahead.
"One underlying worry investors and dealers do have, because of the poor tone in trading, is that the tightening by the Fed will not be enough over time to slow sufficiently the momentum in the economy," Mr. Sherman said.
He cited the report this week on initial jobless claims, noting the decline shown in the four-week moving average after two consecutive weeks of sharp drops.
"This is an indication that the labor market is strong and payroll increases for August, which will be reported in September, will show another large increase," Mr. Sherman said.
 
Bank Lending Said to Be Strong

 
 "Also, interest rate hikes earlier in the year have had no impact on bank loans; they continue to be very strong," he added. "In fact, they accelerated in the post-period of the May 17 tightening by the Fed. And that suggests to me that interest rates have had no impact on slowing the economy."
Next week the Treasury plans to sell $52.65 billion of new bills and notes, of which $28.25 billion will be in two- and five-year notes. On Tuesday the Treasury will auction $17.25 billion of two-year notes and Wednesday, $11 billion of five-year notes.
In when-issued trading late yesterday, the two-year issue was being offered at a price to yield 6.27 percent, and the five-year issue was being offered at a price to yield 6.92 percent.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Ends the Day Flat After Early Losses Abroad

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar ended little changed against other leading currencies yesterday, recovering from an early drop as traders saw threats of intervention by central banks and heard some positive comments on American-Japanese trade issues.
The Mexican peso strengthened on expectations that the presidential election in Mexico tomorrow will go smoothly. The ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party's candidate, Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, is favored to win the election and is widely expected to continue the market-oriented economic policies of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. It took 3.3585 pesos to buy a dollar yesterday, down from 3.3755 on Thursday. 
 The dollar ended in New York at 98.65 Japanese yen, up slightly from 98.57 yen on Thursday. But it slipped to 1.5396 German marks from 1.5440 marks.
The dollar began its slide in Asia, and the decline continued in Europe. Dealers said the drop reflected residual selling after the plunge on Thursday that was prompted by the report of a widening trade deficit between the United States and Japan.
Still, the dollar bounced back in New York yesterday. Win Thin, an economist for MCM Currencywatch Inc., said the Bank of Japan was widely believed to have bought dollars to prevent a further weakening against the yen.
While the intervention was unsuccessful, he said, speculation that the Japanese central bank left buy orders with American banks helped discourage dollar sellers from trying to drive the currency lower.
"It caused a lot of quick moves to buy dollars," he said. "People are nervous about the prospect of another central bank intervention."
Further supporting the dollar was a report in the Japanese financial newspaper Nihon Keizai Shimbun quoting the United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, as saying the gap between American and Japanese positions in the trade talks was "extremely small."
Washington has threatened to impose sanctions against Japan's exports if the two sides fail to resolve a dispute over Japanese Government procurement practices by the end of September.
The currency market is extremely sensitive to any hints of heightened trade tension between the two countries. Japan's huge surplus generates a steady flow of Japanese-held dollars that must be exchanged for yen, undermining the value of the dollar, and the Clinton Administration is still widely believed to favor a strong yen to help narrow the trade gap. When the yen rises in value, it tends to make Japanese exports more expensive for American consumers.

HEADLINE: Theodore Conrad, 84, Modeler And Architecture Preservationist

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

 BODY:
Theodore Conrad, who distilled modern architecture as a model maker and defended historic architecture as a preservationist, died yesterday at his home in Jersey City. He was 84.
He died of congestive heart failure, said a friend, Colin Egan. 
 In 1931, when he was a student at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, Mr. Conrad began making architectural models. He was a pioneer in the use of Plexiglas and metal for models, rather than the traditional wood and cardboard. And he earned increasingly high-profile commissions.
Many modern landmarks assumed their earliest three-dimensional form in Mr. Conrad's Jersey City studio. It was one of his models that gave Jacqueline Kennedy the first glimpse of what her husband's grave would look like at Arlington National Cemetery.
From his studio, he could see the final versions of his work defining the skyline of Manhattan -- "no bigger than the model at that distance and scarcely more substantial looking," The New Yorker said in a 1956 profile.
 
Modeler of New York
 "Well, there's Metropolitan Life -- I did that," Mr. Conrad said in 1981, while surveying the skyline across the Hudson River. "Chase Manhattan. You can't see the Museum of Modern Art -- it's too low. Seagram Building is covered up now. But there's Rockefeller Center, Equitable Life. And of course I built all of lower Manhattan below Houston Street. That's downstairs."
On his model of the Air Force Academy in Colorado, he placed 10,000 airmen, each one-quarter of an inch high. At 16 feet, the Seagram Building model had to be taken to New York over the George Washington Bridge, as it would not fit through the Lincoln Tunnel.
Most recently, Mr. Conrad was best known as a preservationist. In the late 1960's, he led a citizens committee to save the abandoned 60-year-old Hudson County Courthouse, which was threatened with demolition. The group succeeded in having the property listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1970. In the 1980's, it was restored and returned to civic use.
He was also involved in the fight over Loew's Jersey Theater, a 3,200-seat Baroque movie palace on Journal Square in Jersey City that a developer planned to demolish. It was acquired by Jersey City in 1993 and Mr. Conrad, then 83, was present for the 2 A.M. vote by the City Council. Its restoration is being overseen by Jersey City Economic Development Corporation.
Mr. Conrad is survived by his wife, Ruth; two daughters, Doris C. Brown of Jersey City, and Carin Lewis of Berwick, Pa., and three grandchildren.

Wendi Winters, passionate gardener, is growing tomatoes, peppers, beans, sage "and lots more basil this year," she said. And for the first time she has even put in cilantro, "which we know is chic, even though it tastes like soap."
"Everyone has a garden this year, and in fact, the people next door just put one in," added Ms. Winters, who has three garden plots at her Montclair, N.J., home. She is not alone. Despite higher-than-average rainfall and a later-than-usual spring, 10 million more Americans are growing vegetables this season in comparison with last year, according to a study of the nation's gardening business. 
 Retail sales are up 10 percent over last year's $1.1 billion in vegetable-gardening revenues. This year gardeners are spending more and a sampling of suppliers across the country shows that sales growth in seeds, plants and fertilizers by the end of the year should be the largest since 1991.
"There's a real gardening rebound this year," said Bruce Butterfield, research director of the National Gardening Association in Burlington, Vt., which tracks consumer gardening trends on an annual basis.
Over all, lawn and garden sales, of which vegetable gardening is a part, have been flat during the last three years, at about $22 billion annually, according to the association. The average annual growth of 5.3 percent in retail sales during the 1980's dropped to 2.5 percent annually in the 1990's, until this year, Mr. Butterfield said.
According to a recent poll for the gardening association by the Gallup Organization, 35 percent of the nation's 96.4 million households are vegetable gardening, compared with 26 percent of households last year.
For each of the last 22 years, Gallup has conducted 1,500 in-home interviews. The 1994 poll will not be completed until the end of the year, but Gallup conducted an interim telephone poll of 1,000 interviews in late June. It has a margin of error of plus or minus four percentage points.
If the present surge continues, Mr. Butterfield said, by the end of the year, Americans will have spent more than $50 a household on vegetable gardening, up from $43 last year.
Industry executives corroborate the upswing as well. "I think people were suffering from cabin fever, after being snowed under, this winter," said George Ball, chief executive of the W. Atlee Burpee Company of Warminster, Pa., explaining his company's increasing sales. "Spring broke late this year, and gardeners were just champing at the bit."
Last year "the weather wasn't good, all over the country," said Horace Hagedorn, the 79-year-old founder and chief executive of Stern's Miracle-Gro of Port Washington, L.I. There was rain and flooding in the Midwest, he said, and in the East a hot summer that discouraged many gardeners from planting, weeding and picking.
Stern's Miracle-Gro Plant Food is the market leader among home garden fertilizers, and its sales have often served as an industry barometer. This year sales of the company's water-soluble fertilizer are up 15 percent, Mr. Hagedorn said.
Paul Pichieri, manager of Ploch's Garden Center in Clifton, N.J., a large retail outlet, suggested a link between the gardening sales gain and the recovering economy. "Over the last year a lot of people bought houses thanks to the low interest rates, and they've really been putting in the vegetables," he said.
Gardening sales at Ploch's were up 20 percent in April and May during the vegetable-buying peak, Mr. Pichieri said, and sales have been "generally up" ever since. "Perhaps people have extra disposable income this year," he said.
Since 85 percent of vegetable gardeners grow tomatoes, according to the National Lawn and Garden Distributors Association, it means that the remainder of August will be the time of tomato mania. In fact, one of the nation's premier discount retailers of exotic specialty produce, Gourmet Garage in Manhattan, has initiated its own "Great Tomato Roundup," a contest for home gardeners.
The winning Lycopersicon esculentum, a humble tomato, will take the place of honor in a store that has sold truffled liver mousse and chanterelles. The victorious gardener "is to receive $500," said John Gottfried, the store's co-founder, "which, when you consider the cost of terrace gardening in Manhattan, could be the price tag of a single tomato."

HEADLINE: INVESTING;
Israel's Volatile Market Braces for an Onslaught

BYLINE: By Anthony Ramirez 

 BODY:
ISRAEL'S stock market is the fastest-growing, most volatile, riskiest exchange in the risk-taking Middle East. This week, its investors got an added shot of uncertainty.
The Israeli Government on Tuesday proposed a 10 percent tax on stock transactions, and braced itself for a donnybrook. In the tax-heavy country, stock transactions are one of the few things that escape the tax collector. The last time the Government tried to institute such a tax, 30 years ago, it roiled the market. 
 To give investors' tempers time to cool, the Government closed the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, where 616 stocks trade, until tomorrow. Many analysts expect a large, if temporary, selloff when it reopens. "I hope it will be O.K. Sunday," Doron Levy, Israel's income tax commissioner, said. "I am crossing my fingers."
Under the sketchy proposal by the dominant Labor Party, a 10 percent tax on stock profits would be imposed beginning Jan. 1 on both Israeli citizens and foreigners. The tax, which needs the approval of the Israeli Parliament would be adjusted for inflation and probably collected by banks and brokerage firms.
The tax would raise about $180 million, according to the Government, which intends to make offsetting tax cuts elsewhere to spur investment. The plan is the brainchild of Jacob Frenkel, the governor of the Israeli central bank and a former University of Chicago economist.
The Government of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin is hoping the tax will encourage Israelis to view their stocks as long-term investments and thereby reduce the market's notorious volatility. If it succeeds, long-term investors could benefit. Last year, the top 100 stocks on the Tel Aviv exchange rose 21 percent, compared with a 13 percent increase in the Dow Jones industrial average. But inflation fears have pushed those Israeli stocks down 28 percent this year, while the Dow has recovered to virtually where it started the year.
 "Israelis aren't known as smart investors," said Victor Halpert, research manager for Israel Equity Research and Management Ltd. in Chicago. "That's because a long-term investment in Israel is a month."
Such short investment horizons help explain why Israelis are girding for a sharp stock selloff. Israeli mutual funds expect a surge of redemptions by individual investors when the market reopens.
Based on reaction in New York at the end of the week, the mutual funds have reason to be worried. "Five minutes after the tax announcement on Tuesday, we were buried underneath phone calls," said Eddy Shalev, managing director of the Tel Aviv office of Oscar Gruss & Son of New York, a major dealer in Israeli stocks. "People wanted to sell stocks like crazy in New York because they couldn't do it in Israel."
Moreover, Israeli companies that issue American depository receipts, which are traded on American exchanges and represent shares of foreign companies, saw those receipts fall sharply at the end of last week. Even a well-regarded company, like Teva Pharmaceutical, with $502 million in revenues last year, was not spared. Its A.D.R.'s fell to $26.125 on Friday from $27.938 on Monday, before the tax proposal was announced. In all, about 60 Israeli companies and companies with substantial Israeli holdings are listed on the New York, American excahnges and on Nasdaq.
For the short run, Israeli stocks may become a bargain for those brave enough to risk the churning waters. "If the Israelis are going to give their stocks away, Americans should step in and buy them," said Robert J. Mittleman, chief executive officer of Oscar Gruss & Son.
Besides Teva, Mr. Mittleman's firm recommends Scitex, a computer software developer, ECI Telecom, a maker of telecommunications equipment, and Tadiran, a military contractor that also makes communications equipment. Most of those companies' A.D.R.'s have fallen since the proposal was announced.
The growing prospects for peace in the Middle East, despite recent bloodshed in Gaza and Jericho, have been good for the 41-year-old Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. From about $4 billion in market capitalization in 1984, the exchange grew to nearly $44 billion in 1993. A bear market for much of this year, fed by inflation fears, knocked that capitalization to some $37 billion in May. Most American investors in Israel have been big institutions, including mutual fund companies like Fidelity Investments and pension funds like the New York State Teachers Retirement System.
Adopting a gains tax could have surprising consequences, said Mark Meiras, managing director of Pacific Mediterranean Capital Markets, an investment bank in Herzelia, Israel. As in Switzerland, anonymous numbered bank accounts are popular.
"There is perhaps $2 billion to $4 billion of gray money -- I hesitate to say black money -- in Israel," Mr. Meiras said. "With the increased scrutiny that comes from collecting the tax, a lot of this money may simply vanish." Based on Mr. Meiras's estimate, that would be the equivalent of 5 to 10 percent of the country's stock market capitalization.
In a conference call with American and British institutional investors yesterday, Meyer Shavit, Israel's Commissioner of Capital Markets, emphasized that the Government did not plan major changes in its tax proposal, such as allowing stock losses to offset profits. A member of Parliament, however, is said to be preparing just such an amendment.
Mr. Shavit said the Government wanted to encourage long-term investment and, therefore, might consider a sliding scale, imposing a 10 percent gains tax on investments held for just one year and smaller tax bites on investments held longer.

Top Rates and Best Deals On Certificates of Deposit

BYLINE: By Nick Ravo 

 BODY:
WITH interest rates rising and the stock market stagnating, certificates of deposit provide a soothing choice for conservative investors. Some banks are dusting off C.D.'s with gimmicks, like rates that adjust or that track the stock market, for wider appeal. But these souped-up products often carry below-average rates and may lock in investors for long terms.
"Go short term and roll over," said Robert K. Heady, publisher of The Bank Rate Monitor in North Palm Beach, Fla. "Don't lock in at long-term rates, because you'll be able to get higher numbers down the road." 
 Even in the short term, though, investors with enough to invest will do better with Treasury securities. The rate on a six-month T-bill, which can be bought in denominations as small as $10,000, rose 1.74 percentage points from Feb. 2 through Wednesday, when it stood at 4.90 percent. In the same period the average rate on a six-month C.D. rose 0.78 of a percentage point, to 3.53 percent.
In lieu of raising their rates, banks often try to capture attention with unusual products. Especially popular are certificates with flexible rates, sold with names like "rising-rate," "bump-up" or "two-step."
The Heritage Bank in Watertown, Conn., offers an 18-month certificate with a recent rate of 4.60 percent. If interest rates rise, a depositor can adjust once during the term.
Adding a few bells and whistles, Bank Leumi Trust in New York offers a two-year C.D., "Triple Choice Time Deposit," which allows one addition in the first year. Also, depositors can lock in a new rate once and can make one withdrawal of up to half the principal without penalty. On Wednesday, the rate was 4.75 percent.
People who believe the stock market correction presents a buying opportunity but are risk averse will find a middle ground in the form of bank deposits linked to a stock index, typically the Standard & Poor's 500.
Although Bankers Trust and the Republic National Bank of New York recently discontinued their stock-indexed C.D.'s, others can be found. Republic's one-year certificates that matured earlier this month returned only 1.89 percent (75 percent of the return of the Standard & Poor's 500 over the last year) and 2.26 percent (50 percent of the S.& P. 500 plus one percentage point).
To help investors guard against such poor returns, Charter One Financial in Cleveland is offering three-year and five-year Wall Street C.D.'s that pay returns based on the average quarterly rise of the S.& P. 500. Even if the index does not rise, the bank guarantees at least a 5 percent annual return for a five-year certificate, or 4 percent for three years.
"To the best of our knowledge, no other insured stock-indexed C.D. in the nation offers guaranteed minimum returns as high," Charles John Koch, president of Charter One, said.
Perhaps, but in exchange for the guarantee investors lock up their money for the long term, and the guaranteed rate is below the national average of 5.53 percent for a five-year certificate on Wednesday. The highest rate on Wednesday was 6.65 percent from MBNA America in Wilmington, Del., reported The Bank Rate Monitor (800) 327-7717.
Below-average rates are also common among certificates that adjust and that have unusual features, like penalty-free withdrawals or interest paid up front. The highest rates tend to be at banks in regions with the strongest economies -- the Midwest, the Rocky Mountain states and the South, Mr. Heady said.
Probably the only rates well above average are paid on the "naked" C.D.'s offered by institutions that operate without Federal deposit insurance, like Home Savings and Loan in Oklahoma City, which offers a six-month certificate at 5.50 percent and a one-year certificate at 6 percent.

HEADLINE: Too Little Money for Mandates

 BODY:
Last year's motor-voter act requires states to arrange for registering people to vote when they apply for driver's licenses. That is a proper matter for Federal law, strongly supported by this page. But it was also another case of Washington ordering state action without money to pay for it -- an "unfunded mandate" that will cost states tens of millions of dollars a year.
The cost of such mandates has become so burdensome for state and local governments that they are lobbying for relief; state and local authorities seek relief in Congress, while local authorities also seek relief in their state capitals. But it is wrong to demand, as some do, that governments pay for all they decree. As a matter of national policy, some things -- like civil rights -- are local responsibilities but governed by Federal statute. Unemployment insurance is another example. 
 There is no clear line between mandates that should be federally financed and those that should not be. Some require substantial outlays, like Medicaid and the Americans with Disabilities Act. Others are small or cannot even be measured, like the repeal of automatic retirement at age 65. The funding issue is often cloaked in constitutional debate about Federal versus state powers, but commonly resolved by how much money is available and how much muscle the interested parties apply.
Before the Federal deficit ballooned in the Reagan years, Congress voted money for mandated programs more often than it does now; in the deficit squeeze it kept on mandating, but cut the money. The Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations counts 27 major laws enacted in the 1980's with new or expanded regulatory impact at state and local levels -- more than in any previous decade. Among them are laws on fair housing, drug-free workplaces, clean air, child abuse, ocean dumping and highway safety.
Governors and mayors are fighting unfunded mandates because their budgets are tight too; the last thing they need is orders from Washington to spend more, which forces them to tax more. But their campaign also serves conservatives who fight government regulation in general, including state and local regulation.
Governors who rail against the supposed injustice of Federal mandates are guilty themselves, of burdening local governments with state mandates. The New Jersey Legislature recently considered repealing some, such as a requirement that police chiefs be paid at least 5 percent more than deputy chiefs. Mayors want it repealed, but when chiefs turned up en masse in Trenton to object, the repeal bill died.
The Senate Governmental Affairs Committee has approved a bill co-sponsored by its chairman, John Glenn of Ohio, and Dirk Kempthorne of Idaho. It is less rigid than an earlier proposal by Senator Kempthorne and others to require funding for all Federal mandates, which would pose an insurmountable roadblock to needed legislation.
The committee bill would require cost estimates by the Congressional Budget Office early in the gestation of bills that mandate state or local action, with updated estimates along the way. Currently, the Budget Office estimates the cost only after a bill comes out of committee, too late to be useful in the initial shaping. The committee bill also requires Congress to consider how to pay the cost, and to take a vote on payment if a member asks for it.
Proposed amendments could still sink the Glenn-Kempthorne compromise. One would require early cost estimates for mandates imposed on the private sector as well. That makes sense too, but it is so broad that the process would bog down; it makes more sense to start on a smaller scale.
The basic problem of unfunded mandates is so obvious it should not need a law. But it does, and Glenn-Kempthorne meets that need. The cost of even the worthiest cause warrants consideration.

HEADLINE: How Clean in Mexico?

 BODY:
Mexicans vote tomorrow for a new president and Congress in their most important election since single-party dominance took hold in 1929. The ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, still enjoys huge advantages in campaign finance, media access and raw institutional power and remains, polls suggest, the likely overall winner.
But thanks to reforms adopted this year under intense internal and external pressure, opposition parties now have a chance of something like an honest count, and can hope to see their candidates for other offices assume their posts when they win. 
 Despite these encouraging changes and the good intentions of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, some doubt remains whether the election will prove clean enough to assure internal stability and continued smooth relations with the United States.
The chances of a credible vote look better now than they did a few months ago. When the campaign began last fall, President Salinas seemed content to rest on his impressive record of economic reforms, leaving changes in Mexico's notoriously fraudulent electoral system for another day.
Then January's peasant uprising in Chiapas signaled the depth of popular political alienation. In March, the assassination of the ruling party's original presidential candidate, Luis Donaldo Colosio, forced a showdown between PRI reformers and party "dinosaurs" who demanded a return to the corrupt paternalism of the past.
Those events awakened Mr. Salinas to the necessary link between economic and political reforms. Since then the President has been struggling against the rear-guard resistance of dinosaurs who fear they cannot survive in a clean political system.
Mr. Salinas, whose own 1988 election was rife with fraud, has strongly supported the efforts of his Interior Minister, Jorge Carpizo MacGregor, to insure a clean count. The new PRI candidate, Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, has joined their campaign for greater pluralism.
For the first time, a politically balanced national commission will oversee the election. Also for the first time, foreign observers will monitor the vote. But election supervision at the local level remains subject to manipulation, and foreign observers have been limited to an indirect role. Meanwhile, television and newspapers have given Mr. Zedillo greater and more favorable coverage than his rivals. Since a televised debate in the spring brought Diego Fernandez de Cevallos of the National Action Party even with Mr. Zedillo in the polls, the PRI candidate has evaded further debates.
Mr. Fernandez is satisfied with the recent electoral reforms. But the other main opposition candidate, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of the Democratic Revolutionary Party, is not. Mr. Cardenas, who was the victim of blatant fraud in the 1988 presidential vote, is understandably unwilling to accept the honesty of this year's count on faith.
The PRI, created 65 years ago by the victorious generals of the Mexican Revolution to perpetuate their hold on power, has fulfilled that assignment all too well. An unbroken string of PRI candidates have been elected President and held unchecked sway over a PRI-dominated Congress and bureaucracy. Each has then been able to turn over power to a hand-picked successor. Some PRI Presidents have been authentically popular and exceptionally talented. But whomever the PRI nominated, the system continued. The PRI has now held power longer than any other party in the world today.
The overriding U.S. interest is a fair election that Mexicans accept. The U.S. can encourage this by proclaiming its interest in an honest count and avoiding favoritism toward any candidate. Mr. Zedillo and Mr. Fernandez have similar views on international and economic issues. Mr. Cardenas is more leftist and nationalist, but this former PRI Governor and son of a former PRI President is no wild man. Privately, Washington should make plain that another fraud-tainted election would make it awkward for Mexico to attend this year's Miami summit meeting of American democracies, and scare off the private-sector investments the North American Free Trade Agreement was meant to encourage.
Mexican democracy has come a long way from the dark ages of 1988 and the shaky spring of 1994. But its biggest test lies just ahead.

HEADLINE: FLIGHT FROM CUBA: THE POLICY;
Castro's Refugee Weapon Has Been Wielded Before

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIAMI, Aug. 19

 BODY:
The sudden flight of Cubans this week may have caught the United States by surprise and forced the Clinton Administration to reverse immigration policy, but experts say the influx was heralded in public threats by President Fidel Castro two weeks ago as his economic and political difficulties deepened.
 No sooner had Mr. Castro quelled the rioting that broke out on the Havana waterfront on Aug. 5, involving thousands of people who chanted "Down with Fidel!" and clashed with police and security forces, then he declared that the Clinton Administration had launched a "comprehensive offensive" and "subversive plan" against him and he threatened to allow all Cubans unhappy with conditions on the island to leave for the United States. 
We have no special need to keep a boat from leaving," Mr. Castro said during a rambling television news conference just hours after he was forced to personally intervene in the disturbances on the waterfront and call out rapid response brigades to disperse rioters. "This is a U.S. problem more than it is ours."
 Mr. Castro has adopted this strategy before, notably in the 1980 Mariel crisis, which began with eruptions of domestic discontent in Cuba. Mr. Castro responded by encouraging disgruntled Cubans to get out, and 125,000 took to boats for Florida. The exodus may have embarrassed Mr. Castro, but not only did he rid himself of thousands of people who detested him, but he also achieved a political victory over Jimmy Carter when the American President was forced to call a halt to the influx.
 But by acting quickly to cut off the refugee flow this time, Washington has called Mr. Castro's bluff, and his ability to maneuver appears more limited. "I'm not saying he is running scared," one State Department official said today, "but he's trying to divert attention from the kinds of problems he's got there and from the fact that the solutions he is offering appear ever more bankrupt to the average Cuban."
 At a news conference in Quito, Ecuador, after Mr. Clinton's announcement, Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina described it as a positive step but said that the two Governments should conduct "profound and serious" discussions about their relations.
 
Riots Signaled Crisis
 One startling indication that Mr. Castro's problems are more serious than in past crises was the nature and extent of the rioting that broke out on Aug. 5 after authorities seized a ferryboat that had been hijacked in Havana Bay. The disturbances took place on Havana's main seafront boulevard in broad daylight and drew the enthusiastic support of several thousand people, many of them young and unemployed.
 The rioting, and the exodus that has followed it, come after years of economic decline and growing dissatisfaction among Cubans with Mr. Castro's inability to halt it. Since the breakup of the Soviet Union and the disappearance of the artificial subsidies that kept the Cuban economy up and running, the Cuban economy has contracted by an estimated 40 percent, and the standard of living has fallen even more drastically.
 "Fidel doesn't have a lot of options right now," Lisandro Perez, director of the Cuba Research Institute at Florida International University here, said today. "Emigration is about the only card he's got, and if it's the only card he's got, he wants to play it in a way that can get him other things."
 Those other things include an easing or lifting of the American embargo against Cuba that has been in effect for three decades. Mr. Castro has long argued that Cubans take to the seas not because of political repression, but because of the economic difficulties inflicted by the United States' refusal to trade with Cuba.
 
Opportunity and Danger
 The change of policy toward Cuban refugees that President Clinton announced today offers Mr. Castro both opportunities and dangers. Cuban television has been crowing in recent days that "U.S. President William Clinton is now forced to review his policy on Cuba," and Mr. Castro is likely to argue that Washington's sudden turnabout is a victory that he obtained.
 "If the United States fails to adopt immediate and efficient measures to stop the encouragement of illegal departures from the country, we will be duty-bound to instruct our Coast Guard not to intercept any boat leaving Cuba," he said. In fact, boats have been leaving Cuba unimpeded in recent days, and the Clinton Administration has now been forced to close an open door.
 "The message to people in Cuba is that you either have to go out there and die on the streets or accept Castro and accommodate yourself to his regime," said Frank Calzon, who analyzes events in Cuba for the human rights group Freedom House. "To the extent that the United States is perceived as weak and being manipulated by Castro, he comes out ahead and the opposition is less willing to take risks."
 But with the emigration safety valve now closed, Mr. Castro must also deal with thousands of hungry, bored and unhappy Cubans who would otherwise be in Miami. As events of recent years have shown, he has little to offer them except more repression and privation.
 Many American officials have assumed that with the escape valve shut, those who remain behind will begin actively to oppose Mr. Castro and that there will be new eruptions of discontent. The opposition to Mr. Castro is not well organized, however, and disturbances like those earlier this month have occurred before and been quickly suppressed before they could spread.
 Mr. Castro's willingness to resort to a strategy that, by provoking the United States, has the potential to backfire on him is a clear sign that he recognizes he is in a situation unlike any other he has faced.
 "No one knows what might happen tomorrow," he said after the riot. "This situation is imponderable."

HEADLINE: Inside the World's Most Profitable Bank

BYLINE: By EDWARD A. GARGAN 

DATELINE: HONG KONG

 BODY:
IF money talks, then the local currency here says it all.
Four out of every five bills in Hong Kong bear the image of the erector set-style headquarters of the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank, the most powerful financial presence in this British colony and by far, the most visible and influential bank in Asia. 
 Besides minting Hong Kong dollars, the bank has spent much of the last century swaggering through China and across Asia. It has supported trading throughout the region for more than a century. It has helped finance the rise of some of the greatest fortunes in Hong Kong. And it has grown spectacularly in the last decade, benefiting from the rapid advance of Asia's economies and using its Asian profits to pay for the bank's moves into the Middle East, Europe and North America.
Since 1990 the banking company's stock, which trades here and in London, has tripled, almost in lock step with Hong Kong's stock market. Investors value the bank at $29 billion, far more than the market value of better-known banks like, say, Citicorp, at $17 billion, and trailing only eight big Japanese banks. The Hong Kong bank's London-based parent company, known as HSBC Holdings Plc., is quite simply "the most profitable bank in the world," observes Karen Udovenya, a vice president with Morgan Stanley Asia.
But today, the financial juggernaut may be losing momentum. Throughout its Asian stronghold, the Hong Kong bank faces a growing crop of newly aggressive rivals -- banks from the United States, other Asian countries, even mainland China. In Hong Kong, the bank has the uncertainty of what, if any, changes the Communist landlords will make in the colony's vibrant capitalist economy in three years, when Britain's 99-year lease expires and Beijing takes over. And that political question looms large for the 129-year-old Hongkong and Shanghai Bank.
Though it has offices in 65 countries, the bank still earns two thirds of its profits in tiny Hong Kong. A costly diversification strategy that was aimed at reducing that dependence has produced little in the way of real profits. Midland Bank, the linchpin of the bank's foray into British banking, only recently turned the corner, while Marine Midland, its biggest American acquisition, is back in the black but is less than two-thirds the size it was in 1987, when purchased.
What's more, the bank's staid culture -- an old boy network dominated by Englishmen and Scots -- is under assault. Evolved from the bank's colonial heritage, it worked well when banking profits depended on long-standing relationships with clients, government connections and limited competition. But competition is much more open today, as banks are increasingly becoming fast-paced traders in the global money markets.
The Hong Kong bank is changing its ways and diversifying its corporate culture, opening its ranks to more Asians and women. But the question is whether the bank is making the transition quickly enough. The bank's top executives seem to be in no hurry, and certainly in no hurry to leave the bank. Several of them are nearing, or in some cases way past, 53 years in age, the point at which most of them could qualify for a full pension.
With a self-confidence nurtured by decades of success, they claim to be untroubled by the mounting pressures on the bank. "I see these changes as a challenge, not as a threat," said Sir William Purves, the 62-year-old chairman of the bank's holding company in London.
Two other key managers are John Gray, 60, who runs the Hong Kong bank and is its point man on China, and John R. H. Bond, chief executive of the parent company and a relative youngster at 53. Mr. Bond, who also runs Midland Bank, is the odds-on favorite to succeed Sir William when he finally tires of the role. "It's his job to lose," a senior executive of the bank said of Mr. Bond.
It is these three men who helped build the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank from a struggling regional bank into the world's 13th largest bank. Last year, the bank earned $3.8 billion before taxes -- more than any other bank in the world, on assets of $305 billion.
Though the bank's 1993 return on assets of 1.25 percent placed its sixth worldwide, behind institutions like J. P. Morgan and BankAmerica, it exceeds every bank of equal or greater size, a notable feat for a bank of its conservatism.
So far this year, pretax profits are up 24 percent in the six months ended June 30, though not without some window-dressing. Operating profits before special provisions are running about 4 percent behind last year because of higher expenses and losses in bond trading and foreign exchange. Yet, thanks to a much slimmer provision for bad debts than last year's, pretax profits came in at a respectable $2.25 billion.
On the subject of Hong Kong's future, the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank's senior managers sound like unreconstructed optimists. The Chinese, Sir William argues, would be loath to tamper with the money-making city-state, which is both a model of freewheeling capitalism and the economic gateway to China. "They have every intention of getting the most they can out of Hong Kong," he said.
The bank certainly does not want to see change in Hong Kong. It is one of the coziest banking environments on earth, especially for the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank. Because the bank's parent also owns 61.48 percent of its next largest competitor in Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Bank Ltd., it jointly controls 365 bank branches in Hong Kong, and enjoys 60 percent of the market as measured by deposits, analysts estimate.
And the market is a banker's dream of high profit margins and low taxes. Corporate taxes here are just 16.5 percent, and deposit accounts yield less than the rate of inflation, largely because of a government-sanctioned banking cartel. That means that banks can get away with charging 7 or 8 percent interest on funds that only cost them 1 or 2 percent.
STILL, there is no guarantee that the bank's lucrative arrangement will continue. And the political uncertainty of China taking over the colony may be less a threat than the changes in local banking that are being wrought by market forces.
Danny Truell, the head of Hong Kong research at S. G. Warburg Securities (Far East) Ltd., warns that Hong Kong's effective negative interests rates are already pinching deposit growth, chasing funds into the stock market and into real estate. An easing of growth in the bank's high-margin business of deposit-taking and lending comes at a time when the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank's earnings from foreign exchange and bond-trading operations are down. Yet, Mr. Truell adds, "This is still going to be a very profitable bank."
For years, Hongkong and Shanghai Bank executives have brushed aside questions about the bank's commitment to Hong Kong by simply pointing to its monumental headquarters, opened in downtown Hong Kong in 1985. The 52-story building was designed by Norman Foster, a famous British architect, and it was rumored to cost more than $1 billion. Inside the gray exoskeleton of cross beams and pipes, visitors are transported first by a suspended escalator -- positioned off-center in accordance with the Chinese superstitious practice of feng shui -- and then whisked upstairs by elevators whose dashboards blink with the latest stock-market quotes.
But two years ago, the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank bought Midland, a large British bank, in a $6 billion deal -- and the move raised new questions about the bank's confidence in Hong Kong's future. The investment itself was a sizable diversification outside the colony. Beyond that, the bank set up a holding company in London, HSBC, and Sir William and a group of the headquarters staff went to Britain.
Sir William insists that the London move betrays no lack of faith in Hong Kong. The holding company, he explains, had to be set up to allay the fears of British regulators about having a foreign bank owning a major British bank. Sir William insists he is staying on London mainly to guide the integration of Midland with the Hong Kong bank's operations, including the two banks' capital markets and treasury groups in London.
SIR WILLIAM is also staying on in the bank's top job longer than he had indicated earlier. At 62, he is already nine years beyond the age at which he could have retired, given the many years he spent abroad. Two years ago, he told the The Financial Times in an interview that he was eager for retirement. These days, he explains his plan is to remain HSBC chairman for "a couple more years."
Despite the London move, Sir William insists that Hongkong and Shanghai Bank will remain first and foremost an Asian bank. "Asia is the home of the bank," said the chairman, who is known inside the bank as Willie. "As long as the economies of Asia are growing at two to three times the economies elsewhere, it will be our growth area."
Asian nations where the bank has a powerful presence -- Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore and China, for example -- are growing 7 percent to 11 percent a year. The region is a hotbed for foreign investment and trade.
The Hong Kong bank is extending its network in Asia. Last year, the bank opened two new branches in India and four in Indonesia. It is scheduled to open a branch in Taiwan later this year, and is expanding its foreign exchange and bond trading operation in Japan. It has also applied for branch licenses in Vietnam, whose long-dormant economy has revived with a vengeance.
Speaking of the Hong Kong bank's wealth of Asian experience, good and bad, Clinton P. Marshall, the head of corporate banking, says, "We've been thrown out of more countries in Asia than Citibank has ever opened in. We're used to operating in very difficult conditions."
From its trading-port home base, the Hong Kong bank has always ventured abroad, first into Asia and then across the globe. Its holding company controls dozens of banks and financial institutions in markets ranging from Saudi Arabia to upstate New York. In addition to the Midland Bank in Britain and Marine Midland in the United States, (no prior relation despite the similarities in names), the holding company also owns a cluster of investment banks under the Wardley Group and James Capel names, the Hong Kong Bank of Canada and the British Bank of the Middle East.
The Hong Kong bank's global reach owes much to the way it has groomed its leaders. Once, it might have been regarded as training colonial emissaries, but today the system has evolved into a regimen for educating an elite group of cosmopolitan business people. Many of the Hong Kong bank's executives remember it as a kind of corporate boot camp.
John Gray, who runs the bank in Hong Kong, can vividly recall the dreary January day in 1956 when, at 22, he boarded a steamer in England for the month-long trip east, with ports of call including Bombay, Penang and Singapore, before reaching Hong Kong. For the young man, it was a rite of passage that his father underwent before him, and a great uncle before that. "You didn't exist in the bank until you got on the boat," Mr. Gray explained.
LIKE those before and after him, he wore wool suits in Hong Kong's sweltering summers, charged through jungles in Malaysia with carloads of cash, ate curries in Bombay, and reveled in the opportunity to play financial swashbuckler.
Mr. Marshall, for his part, remembers driving down the beach from Brunei Town to Kuala Belait with a Land Rover stuffed with cash. "There weren't any roads in those days, so down the beach we went," he said. "That was banking."
Being an "international officer," or I.O., as the trainees were called, meant being willing to move anywhere, anywhere at all. "At the drop of a hat," Sir William recalled.
The Hong Kong bank now has 98,400 employees, but it is still this tiny network of some 400 international officers who provide the direction and culture of the bank -- a culture which values long-term thinking, a cost-conscious operating style and a disdain for bureaucracy.
Roughly 700 applicants vie for about a dozen spots each year. And until this summer, all those chosen came to Hong Kong to learn the craft of banking. They started their five years of training living on Hong Kong's Peak in a barracks-like compound called Cloudlands, because it is often shrouded in mist. Typically, the international officers moved around Asia every year or so after that.
"The mess is where the I.O. culture and network starts," says Jacqueline Gilhooley, who at 25 is one of only 12 women who have trained as international officers since 1989, when the all-male tradition was dropped.
Ms. Gilhooley, like all international officers, is starting near the bottom of the bank's hierarchy, sitting at a desk in a vast room shoveling heaps of import and export documents around. Afterwards, she can expect to serve stints in several other departs on her way to being trained as a well-rounded generalist, which is what the bank wants its international officers to be.
The days when bank officers carried money through jungles in jeeps may be over. But the tenets of the international officer culture remain, like an unswerving commitment by both the bank and officers. "You sign up for life," Ms. Gilhooley observed.
The Hong Kong bank wants to make sure it maintains that kind of loyalty from its executive corps, but it is also trying to fine-tune its culture. To broaden the training of its management recruits, their early indoctrination now starts at a country manor in England, though young international officers who are assigned to Hong Kong will then be housed in Cloudlands. The bank is also trying to recruit more Asians, especially Chinese, into its management ranks, a goal that has eluded it in all but a few cases. One rising star it is especially proud of is Vincent Cheng Hoi Chuen, a Hong Kong Chinese, who on Nov. 1 will become the bank's chief financial officer.
To Mr. Purves, the changes are a question of survival. "The world is a fast changing place," he said. "Nothing stands still."
Trying to sprinkle its managerial ranks with Chinese seems a prudent display of sensitivity since the Chinese will soon take control of Hong Kong. The bank needs to remain in Beijing's good graces both to remain dominant in its home market and to get a chance to participate in the banking opportunity that could open up in China.
ALREADY the Bank of China, a group of 13 banks controlled by the Chinese Government, is pushing hard into retail banking and the local business community here. Recently, it won permission to start minting money later this year, a privilege that the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank until now only had to share to a small extent with Standard Chartered Bank.
"The Bank of China is clearly pressing here," said Mr. Truell, the Warburg analyst. "They clearly are benefiting from People's Republic of China business."
In China, the Hong Kong bank is eager to return to Shanghai, the mainland's big trading city, where the bank once held sway. Before the Communist revolution in 1949, the bank occupied a lumbering granite colossus in Shanghai's old financial district Afterwards, the bank was evicted and the local Communist party moved into the building.
The building has been put up for sale by the Communist Government. Whether it makes sense to bid for the building now, with little prospect of much business soon, is uncertain. China restricts all foreign banks to dealing in foreign exchange, excluding Hongkong and Shanghai Bank from a vast swathe of the China market. But Mr. Gray, whose father managed the Shanghai branch long ago, sounds interested nonetheless. "We will submit a tender," Mr. Gray said. "It sends a strong signal that the Hongkong Shanghai Bank is back in Shanghai."
 
 
 
A SATISFIED CUSTOMER
 ONE of the Hong Kong bank's most loyal corporate customers is also one of this territory's wealthiest men: Gordon Y.S. Wu, the builder of China's first superhighway and the developer of power projects from China to Pakistan.
"They've been in on every one of my projects," explained Mr. Wu during an interview in his 64th-floor office overlooking Hong Kong and its boat-filled harbor. "All I've had to do is go up there and outline what I've wanted, securities, repayment arrangements, and they're there. It's a tremendous bank."
Mr. Wu rubbed his hands across the mahogany conference table in his office. "Let me tell you a story," he began. "I'm the seventh of nine kids and I worked for a father who was reasonably wealthy. He decided to retire in 1969, and all of a sudden, I was in a crisis because he was able to retire but I couldn't. If I stick my head out and say, 'Pop, give me some money so I can start a business,' I can see eight other hands."
"So I said, 'Pop, are you willing to give me a bank guarantee so I can raise some money?' I was very persuasive. I said, 'If I make it, the guarantee becomes academic. And if I don't make it, just don't give me any more.' He said, 'That sounds fair. Go try your luck at the bank.' So I went to see the bank manager at the time. The guy smiled and said, 'Yes, we know you. We know you can do it. No problem.' I tried to get a little bit of mileage out of it. I said, 'Can I do it without the guarantee?' He said no. And that fellow's name is Willie Purves."
Mr. Wu laughed at his memory and sighed. "We have both come a long way."

HEADLINE: World Markets;
In Singapore, a Decidedly Malay Accent

BYLINE: By Edward Gargan 

DATELINE: SINGAPORE

 BODY:
IF dullness were a virtue, Singapore's stock market would be beatified, which for a country that saw its economy grow 10.5 percent in the first half of 1994 is, at first glance, pretty odd. The problem is that very little of what makes Singapore's economy go is actually playable in the market here, and what is really interesting happens to belong to another country, Malaysia.
"Typically in a period of turbulence, people look for safe havens," said Manu Bhaskaran, the research director at Crosby Securities Pte. Ltd. "Singapore is seen as a safe haven. It's a bit boring, but people feel safe. The Government manages things quite well. It's perceived as a lower risk place. It's like a flight to quality." 
 What isn't boring lies across the border in Malaysia, whose prime companies are listed on a separate exchange here called CLOB -- the Central Limit Order Book, Singapore's computerized over-the-counter market for foreign issues.
"Now, 70 percent of the market turnover here is in Malaysian stocks," said Kevin Scully, the research director for Schroder Securities (Singapore) Pte. Ltd. "Stock volatility is much higher in Malaysian stocks. The market is more imperfect in terms of information, but the opportunity to outperform the market is much higher than in Singapore." He paused and chuckled, "I don't like to use the word speculative."
At the core of Singapore's market, which reached its historical peak last Jan. 4 when the Straits Times Industrials Index touched 2471.9, has been the lack of correlation between this city-state's phenomenal growth and the structure of its market.
So far this year, the electronics industry, much of it computer peripherals, has driven the economy, with other sectors like banking and ship repair lagging. In the second quarter, Singapore's manufacturing sector grew 14 percent. Unfortunately for individual investors here, and for institutional investors hoping to cash in on the country's growth, the electronics industry is largely owned by American multinationals.
"The big sectors, banking, telecommunications, property, they don't correlate to economic growth, which is manufacturing. And manufacturing is electronics," said Mr. Bhaskaran. "There is no big stock geared to the electronics sector." Only 1.7 percent of the market capitalization is reflected by electronics stocks.
On Thursday, the Straits Times Index closed at 2347.17. So far this year, the index has fallen by 3.24 percent, but risen in dollar value by 3.71 percent.
Some of the lackluster performance here, as well as in markets like Hong Kong's, is attributable, according to many analysts, to fretting about interest rates in the United States. And some analysts believe that the era of dullness is ready for some buffing.
Ngo Get Ping, a senior vice president at Nomura Securities, mentioned last week's move by the Malaysian Government on foreign capital flows into the Malaysian market. "This is the start of another bull run," he said. "The market is running. I think it will easily break the high of January."
But at the moment, Mr. Bhaskaran said that for the most part, institutional investors, while retaining some presence in the Singapore market, were looking for far more aggressive performers elsewhere in the region. "Institutional investors are obviously interested in a degree of outperformance," he said. "If you look at Singapore, the P/E is really trading at the high end of the historic trading range, whereas some other markets have come down, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Thailand.
"And second, the economy here is clearly peaking. Growth isn't going to fall precipitously, but it will decelerate. Real interest rates will probably go up sharply next year and after two-and-a-quarter years of very, very rapid rates of economic growth, there are bound to be stresses and strains in the economy that could generate responses from the Government. In that environment, is it worth paying the kind of market multiple that is demanded? I would guess not. So it's not very likely you're going to get outperformance."
Mr. Scully at Schroder's is not so sure. In fact, he argued that the worst performers in Singapore's economy may have bottomed out, like the property market, which saw rental returns plunging by as much as 50 percent in the last two years, and the ship-repair industry, another mainstay of the economy, where earnings were off 20 percent in the first half of 1994. "We've seen the bottom," he said, "and it is time for this to come back."
As a result, he is recommending both property and marine stocks, as well as hotels, which have historically done well here. "We like commercial property, issues like Singapore Land Ltd. and Straights Steamship Land Ltd. We are starting to see some pockets of firming in the core area of the business district. And we do like ship repair. We feel the worst is over. We like Keppel Corp. Ltd. and Jurong Shipyard."
Even though earnings in the marine sector have been down, Mr. Scully said he expected to see a pickup in demand for crude oil, which combined with the average 20-year age of the global tanker fleet, means a pickup in activity for repair yards. "We are picking this as the bottom of the cycle," he said.
But, as Mr. Ping said, the real action remains in Malaysia. "Malaysia is an infrastructure play, telecommunications and utilities," he said. "I'm bullish on Malaysia. Everyone's bullish on Malaysia."

COMPANIES
 
Reform or Not, Here Comes the Latest, Largest Drug Merger
Health reform may come in fits and starts in Washington, but in the private sector it chugs along nicely. Last week saw the biggest drug merger yet, with American Home Products buying American Cyanamid for $9.7 billion -- a heady $101 a share for Cyanamid, which traded under $60 just a month ago. American, which makes Advil, Anacin and Dristan, and Cyanamid, which makes Centrum vitamins and Fibercon laxatives, have combined sales of $12.6 billion. The deal will create "significant synergies," said John Stafford, American's chief, and analysts heard in that phrase coming job cuts and other economies. Some fault the horizontal merger, though, saying it is smarter to marry a managed-care company or a strong innovator. Either way, private health reform proceeds apace. Can D.C. catch up? Last week's other news -- that I.B.M. urged its 110,000 workers to resist the pending reform bills -- won't help. 

Fiscal Fitness for Bell Atlantic
Telephone companies, long idled by monopoly, are now getting trim for the Big Event -- competition. Last week, in taking a $2.3 billion charge against third-quarter earnings, Bell Atlantic revealed its exercise plan: to shed 5,600 workers by 1997 and to convert to the accounting methods that unregulated companies use. Bell Atlantic is by no means sweating alone. Since November 1992, phone companies have announced a collective 120,000 job cuts. And, as new technology and new rivals appear on the scene, other types of cost-trimming have become "a daily event" for the industry, said one analyst. Huff, puff.
 
Spies Only Have Eyes for Cray
Politics has put spies out of fashion, and technology may do the same to supercomputers. But last week the two found some solace together, with the National Security Agency announcing a $4.2 million contract with Cray Computer for a super spying machine. The deal is Cray's first since computer legend Seymour Cray founded the company in 1989. And some say it may be the last. As one analyst wondered, "Is there any other entity on the planet" besides the N.S.A. that is "interested in a 512,000 processor array?" A second worry: Thinking Machines, another supercomputer maker also hurt by an eroding Government market, announced last week it would file for bankruptcy.
 
Last Act for Warner Legend
What do Frank Sinatra and Madonna have in common? One -- maybe the only -- thing is that both were managed by Mo Ostin, the legendary head of Warner Brothers Records, who announced last week that he will retire December 31. Mr. Ostin's long riff of successes included Jimi Hendrix, Prince and R.E.M. And no less an industry power than David Geffen, of Geffen Records, joined in singing Ostin's praises. "Music was entirely a New York business until he put Burbank on the map," Mr. Geffen said. Meanwhile, the beat goes on: Mr. Ostin's successor will be Lenny Waronker, now the company's president.
 
Pink Panther to Peddle
What does Owens-Corning do? Glen H. Hiner, its chief executive, believes he knows how you'll answer. "People think we make Corning Ware," he complained last week. "It's a fine product -- but we don't make it." Such confusion has spurred the $3.2 billion manufacturer of insulation and other composite materials to roll out the Pink Panther, that debonair but devilish cartoon character, for a $10 million ad campaign. Mr. Hiner hopes the Panther will raise the company's stock by raising its profile. But doubters say asbestos issues are what depress the equity.
 
INTERNATIONAL
 
Japan, U.S. in Patent Accord
As if making a better mousetrap weren't hard enough, U.S. inventors seeking Japanese patents have to file their applications in Japanese. English will soon be acceptable, though, in one of several patent-system changes that Japan and America approved last week in their broad trade talks. The United States promised to publish patent applications before they are granted, for instance, and Japan agreed to act on patent requests within three years instead of the current five. Bruce A. Lehman, U.S. patents commissioner, completed a "brilliant" pact, said one expert.
 
Insurance Trouble in Toronto
It's 1990 again, at least in Canada. Confederation Life, the nation's fifth-largest insurer, was seized by regulators on Aug. 11 and approved for liquidation by a Toronto court last week. Shades of four years ago, when two American life insurers similarly troubled by bad investments -- Executive Life and Mutual Benefit Life -- were also placed under government control after being beset by troubled investments. Except that Confederation -- with $14 billion (United States) in assets as of December -- may be the biggest failure; Executive had $10 billion when it went belly up, and Mutual had $13 billion. Another difference: Confederation does business not just in Canada, but in America and Britain.
 
ECONOMY
 
Inflation Fears: Fed Takes Fifth
February 4. March 22. April 18. May 17. And now, August 16. For the fifth time this year, the Federal Reserve has bumped up short-term interest rates. With the 0.5 percent rise, the central bank spurned the Goldilocks view of the economy -- "not too hot, not too cold, but just right" -- and focused instead on the nation's brisk second-quarter growth of 3.7 percent and other inflationary signs. But critics, citing the 2.8 percent rise in consumer prices in the past year, say the Fed has needlessly risked jobs and growth. The bank gave them some comfort: It hinted that, if it raises rates again, it won't be until November.
 
Chrysler's Drive for the Boomers
"Our toughest market" is what one Chrysler executive calls Baby Boomers. "They're on their third or fourth Accord and they're highly satisfied." But Chrysler has a plan to bring the Boomers home when they buy their next compact sedan, the family car of yuppie choice. First came its announcement last week of a $17,970 base price for this fall's Cirrus; that's an in-the-ballpark figure for affluent Boomers but well under the cost of Honda's competing Accord and Toyota's Camry. Then comes Chrysler's Boomer-friendly ad campaign -- spots in the Brooks Brothers catalogue, with a stress on car safety. Ford will also field compact sedans for richer, younger buyers this fall, and one analyst is impressed. The compacts are Detroit's "biggest threat yet" to Japan, he said.
 
But What Did They Buy?
Ching, ching, ching. The cash registers rang merrily last quarter for three of the nation's largest retailers. At Wal-Mart -- the biggest of all -- sales jumped to a record $20.2 billion from $16.4 billion in the comparable period last year. At Dayton Hudson, sales grew to $4.8 billion from $4.3 billion. And at J.C. Penney, the registers logged $4.2 billion this year and $4.0 billion in 1993. When the ringing stopped, the real numbers emerged. Wal-Mart earned about $80 million more this quarter than in same 1993 period, Dayton Hudson about $25 million more, and Penney an added $20 million. Ah, shoppers.
 
Brokers, Sharpen Your Pencils
Lawyers do it; now brokers may, too. Last week, after long debate, a committee of the securities industry proposed a continuing education program for America's 480,000 brokers and traders. Under the plan, subject to S.E.C. approval, Wall Streeters with under 10 years' experience -- about 87 percent of them -- must bone up after their second, fifth and tenth years. Anyone who has been barred, suspended or fined at least $5,000 must take the sessions regardless of career length. And every broker and trader, every year, must review his or her firm's financial products. Better hope your broker gets A's.
 
Compaq Slices its Prices
Looking pretty sharp, Compaq slashed its prices last week by a hefty 11 percent to 22 percent. Analysts predict price-cutting will now spread throughout the personal computer market -- but many also say Compaq holds the edge. For one, it has a big war chest -- a 3-month, $2.2 billion inventory. For another, its profit margins, higher than most in the industry, cushion it from great price-cut damage. Plus, Compaq's been on the move. From 1993's second quarter to this year's, the maker of Deskpro and other computers has passed I.B.M. and Apple in market share.

Three Careers and Counting

BYLINE: By Laurie Flynn 

 BODY:
CALL Prof. John J. Donovan the Johnny Carson of the training circuit. The ebullient Mr. Donovan doesn't so much teach his seminars as "host" them, entertaining his audience of often skeptical corporate executives while he extols the virtues of replacing aging mainframe computers with technology based on powerful personal computer technology.
Professor Donovan is president and chief executive of the Cambridge Technology Group, a three-year-old information systems training company in Cambridge, Mass., with about 50 employees, and is a management professor at M.I.T. With an armful of degrees, including a Ph.D. that covers medicine, engineering and philosophy, he has been an electrical engineer, an engineering professor and a clinical pediatrician at Tufts Medical School. Today, Professor Donovan is revving up for career No. 4. 
 Question. How do you decide when it's time to leave one career?
Answer. In each case, I finished what I wanted to accomplish. In pediatric medicine, I helped establish the birth defects center at the Tufts New England Medical Center. In electrical engineering, I wrote some of the fundamental textbooks. At the M.I.T.-Sloan School, I helped establish a research organization in information systems. Once I did that, I went into business. I had always planned to leave all those careers.
Q. Do you ever miss medicine?
A. I can now make a far bigger contribution to medicine by being in business. If we can make providing medical treatment more efficient and affordable, that's more than President Clinton can do. I don't want anyone to think I'm a 1960's hippie or anything, but if you're going to share the wealth, you've got to have wealth to share.
The technology I'm working on is directly affecting the economies of the areas I work in. Traditional business strategies don't work anymore. Look at Tom Peter's book, "In Search of Excellence," about 20 successful companies. Boom. Most of them are gone today.
Q. What's your next career?
A. My goal is that I'll make a major shift in five years; I'll leave the business world for the public service. There, I'll try to address the education problems facing the country -- 20 percent of children today are illiterate. If that goes on, the wealth of the country and its ability to do anything will dissipate.
Q. Will you advocate the privatization of education?
A. You never walk into a problem with a solution in mind. I don't have a solution; all I have is enormous resources. I am going to argue that we have to narrow the problem.
Q. What's the secret to having such a full career?
A. I've been given a biological gift that I don't need to get quite as much sleep as most people. I'm probably up to needing three to four hours a night now, which is a lot.

Europe, Too, Contracts a Bad Case of Inflationphobia

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
THE dilemma is a familiar one. Higher interest rates mean less growth, but also less chance that the inflation monster will escape from the box. Will another turn of the screw keep the economy in trim or choke off recovery?
Like their American counterparts, Europe's government bankers are groping with the same imponderables that affect everyone with a stake in the ongoing miracle of postwar Western affluence. And like the governors of the Federal Reserve, the gnomes of Zurich and other European capitals are inclined these days to err on the side of fiscal and monetary prudence. 
 But there is a big difference. The American economy has been chugging along briskly for at least a year, and the numbers suggest it is operating near capacity. The European economies, by contrast, are just climbing from the doldrums and could easily slip back. What's more, much of Europe is coming out of recession with rates of unemployment that would send sober midwestern Jaycees to the barricades.
Even though Europeans are "sick over chronic unemployment," says Richard Freeman, an economist at Harvard, the "accepted wisdom" simply will not permit governments to take chances with inflation. Michael Saunders, an economist for Salomon Brothers in London, predicts that Britain is poised to tighten credit in spite of 9 percent joblessness.
Why are the politics of inflation versus growth and unemployment so different on the two continents?
The hyperinflation of the early 1920's, which wiped out the savings of Germany's lower middle class, has been widely interpreted as the fateful blow from which the democratic Weimar Republic never recovered. But the rest of Western Europe, which experienced its share of inflation in the postwar decades, also has strong feelings on the issue, viewing price stability as a sign of arrival among the world's economic elite. "A tremendous investment has been made in fighting inflation," notes Georges de Menil, a senior editor of the European-based journal Economic Policy, and such hard-won victories are not casually sacrificed.
Less appreciated on this side of the Atlantic is the political trauma associated with France's last attempt to march to a different economic drummer. When France's new Socialist government attempted to use fiscal stimulus to rouse the economy from its stupor in the early 1980's, the rush to escape to other currencies forced a humiliated Paris to devalue the currency and to reverse its policy overnight. "The message came through loud and clear that go-it-alone Keynsianism was no longer possible" explains Mr. de Menil. A country proposing to take radical economic action had better have the support of the other European powers.
If that message was strong in 1983, it is even stronger today. Indeed, the search for the Holy Grail of European monetary union turns on the conviction that European policymakers must act as one -- which as a practical matter means acting as conservatively as the powerhouse German and French economies.
And even if there were a general accord that stimulus was a good idea, the options are far more limited than a year ago. The 1993 Maastrict accord requires countries joining the monetary union to limit government budget deficits to a narrow range. The unintended effect, says Mr. de Menil, is to rule out big tax cuts or spending increases as a catalyst for collective growth.
Even so, unemployment rates in Europe are at levels that would not be tolerated in America, no matter what else was at stake. Italy's jobless rate exceeds 11 percent; France, Belgium and Spain are coping with 12 percent, 14 percent and 24 percent respectively. Robert Hormats, the vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International, argues that inflation-fighting policies can be maintained in this climate because "the politics of unemployment are radically different." When the unemployed are neither stigmatized nor denied a tolerable living standard, they are less likely to complain.
But perhaps the most striking difference between Europe and America is Europeans' deep pessimism that the macro-economist's potions can cure what ails their economies. Fiscal and monetary stimulus work by putting money into people's hands, thus stimulating demand for what could be produced in underutilized factories and offices. But in every economy there are barriers -- institutional rigidities that constrain growth and feed price increases before everyone is back on the payroll. And those barriers are much higher in Europe.
In Britain, for example, a lack of free market rental housing prevents the unemployed from simply going where the jobs are. In Eastern Germany, fierce unions prevent wages from falling to levels that match productivity. And in France, a minimum wage three times as high as America's deters employers from taking on the unskilled.
That leads most European economists to focus on removing these "structural" causes of slow growth and high unemployment through deregulation. And insidiously, notes Mr. de Menil, this approach inhibits those who would attack joblessness through macroeconomic measures such as low interest rates. Lowering unemployment, it is believed, would make it yet more difficult politically to attack the perks of the winners -- those who benefit, for example, from union power or rent control, while dragging down the rest of the economy.
That explains why the European economic wisdom of the hour is "deregulate, make yourself more like the U.S.," says Mr. Freeman. But it also makes it a safe bet that Europe's inflation police will step on the brakes long before the European economies hit full speed.

HEADLINE: The Nation: Growing Old, Politically;
It's the Voters Who Seem to Get Cranky

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK 

DATELINE: ALBANY

 BODY:
LESS than three years after spurning a chance at Presidential immortality, Mario M. Cuomo, the man so often cast as New York's Hamlet on the Hudson, now risks the humiliation and abandonment of Lear.
In neighboring New Jersey, meanwhile, the state's freshman Governor, Christine Todd Whitman, once scorned as a lightweight candidate, suddenly finds herself mentioned as a possible 1996 Vice Presidential hopeful after pushing a groundbreaking income tax cut through a sympathetic Legislature. 
 One New Jersey poll showed that as constituents came to know Mrs. Whitman between February and June, her approval rating jumped from 37 percent to 50 percent. Another poll measured her approval rating at a stunning 78 percent in May.
Mr. Cuomo's ratings, by contrast, sat at 36 percent last March, near his all-time low, and less than half the 77 percent approval of January 1988. After skillfully using his incumbency to scare off major challengers in 1986 and 1990, he now faces a tight race against George E. Pataki, an obscure Republican State Senator. Mr. Pataki's only administrative preparation for running a state of 18 million people came as Mayor of Peekskill, a city of fewer than 20,000, and pollsters believe his support largely reflects anti-Cuomo sentiment.
The contrast between the confident verve of New Jersey's new Governor and the uncharacteristic defensiveness of New York's longtime leader speaks volumes about the life span of American politicians.
In politics, as in sports, luck plays a part. But both games also thrive on a sense of expectation, possibility and style, all of which are highly perishable commodities. At 62, Mr. Cuomo is no longer a might-be President, but a might-have-been. People can tire quickly of might-have-beens.
And over time, any style -- be it brassy or professorial, smooth or rough-and-tumble -- can turn to shtick, at least in the jaundiced eyes of the voters.
If political popularity is made up of components like longevity, economic conditions, governmental activism, ideology, national prominence, personality, and ability to explain accomplishments, Mrs. Whitman has all the variables working in her favor. Mr. Cuomo, on the other hand, seems to be fighting against each force.
The distinction could have a direct impact on Mr. Cuomo's campaign. Political analysts believe that the early success of Mrs. Whitman, and of Rudolph W. Giuliani, the Republican Mayor of New York City, may help convince Democratic and independent voters in New York that the election of an untested Republican will not bring ruin.
"They're watching alternatives that seem to be working," said Richard N. Bond, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee. "That does Pataki a world of good."
In an era of widespread disillusionment with politics, as demonstrated by the visceral appeal of term limits, it should not be surprising that even a national Democratic icon like Mr. Cuomo can face widespread antagonism after three terms in office. In New York, only Nelson A. Rockefeller and George Clinton, the state's first governor, have survived longer.
It also is still possible -- and some political analysts believe likely -- that Mr. Cuomo will win the 1994 election and ride that accomplishment to legendary status as a politician, even if his reviews as a governor remain mixed. His pure political talents probably are unmatched in any statehouse in the land. His energy and enthusiasm for his work have not waned. Remarkably, his administration has been untouched by major scandal.
And yet many voters apparently believe he has done little to improve their lives. Unlike Mrs. Whitman, who rules a state where both houses are controlled by her party, Mr. Cuomo has had to struggle continuously against a divided Legislature. And each decision he has made over 12 years has helped construct a "coalition of the disaffected," in the words of Stephen A. Salmore, a Republican political consultant in New Jersey.
Furthermore, many New Yorkers say in interviews that they simply have grown weary of Mr. Cuomo. His distinctly New York combination of grandiloquence and gratuitous combativeness, which so enthrall the Californians and Iowans who see him occasionally on television, has worn thin at home. His media consultant, David Garth, has yet to include Mr. Cuomo in any of the campaign's television commercials.
Lingering effects of New York's recession have only fed discontent. New York lost more than 570,000 jobs from June 1989 to September 1992, almost 7 percent of its job base, according to the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. It has significantly lagged behind the national recovery, gaining back only 17 percent of its loss.
Coincident with the recession, Mr. Cuomo made himself something of a lame duck on the national stage by taking himself out of the 1992 Presidential race, as he also had done in 1988, and by rejecting a possible appointment to the Supreme Court. (Lee M. Miringoff, a New York pollster who has measured Mr. Cuomo's popularity since he took office, has long believed that the Governor's approval ratings were inflated during the late 1980's and early 1990's by his national prominence.)
Lastly, Mr. Cuomo says he has been harmed by his decision to address dozens of issues rather than building a single legacy, an approach he shares with President Clinton. Mrs. Whitman, by contrast, has focused on a single, popular issue -- tax cuts. "She came to office promising to cut taxes and not do anything else, and she's kept both promises," said Mr. Salmore.
Pollsters and political scientists also believe that Ms. Whitman has benefited from her accessible personality and her serene style. Plus she took office as New Jersey's economy was recovering, and faster than New York's. But New Jersey pollsters warn that Ms. Whitman's popularity could be fleeting, and her staying power far less than Mr. Cuomo's. She paid for the first installment of her promised 30 percent cut in income taxes partly by raiding employee pension funds, and it remains to be seen whether cuts in services will force local governments to raise property taxes.
Furthermore, New Jerseyans may remember that another freshman governor was hailed in his first year as a potential Presidential candidate. But by the time Jim Florio ran for re-election in 1993, he was so unpopular that Mrs. Whitman beat him with a campaign that was considered laughably inept until its final weeks. Whether Mrs. Whitman learns from that history lesson may determine how tiresome the voters find her in 1997.

HEADLINE: Aug. 14-20: Look Who's Talking Too;
Call Us! Scream at Us! Boost Our Ratings!

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT 

 BODY:
NEVER before, it seems, have so many Americans been so eager to hear themselves talk. Or so willing to listen to others and call it entertainment.
During the 1992 Presidential campaign, much was made of the impact of talk radio, which drew its strength from the anomie of the electorate. Now talk radio has a new competitor: talk TV. 
 Last month NBC launched a new 24-hour cable television channel called America's Talking. Tomorrow CNN, which is already home to Larry King's popular call-in show, will introduce a new show, "TalkBack Live," featuring both a live audience and an open switchboard. CNBC, another NBC-owned cable channel, already devotes its entire prime-time schedule to taking calls, starting at 8 P.M. with a general interest call-in show, and winding up at 11 P.M. with "Real Personal," a call-in show about sex.
"I see talk comprising a significant percentage of all the new cable channels," said Michael Harrison, editor of Talkers, a magazine about talk radio. "I see it emulating talk radio, which is a new phenomenon."
Broadly defined, talk has long been a standard feature of the electronic media. In 1960 KABC in Los Angeles was the first radio station in the country to convert to an all-news-and-talk format. Seven years later Phil Donahue's show began.
But talk as a dominant genre on radio is relatively recent. Over the last five years, its share of the audience has grown by 45 percent, according to Arbitron, a ratings service, making talk and talk/news the most popular format on the radio.
And while Mr. Donahue and his colleagues Oprah, Sally, Geraldo et alia have been on the air for years, it is only very recently that television has reached beyond the studio to embrace talk in its most freewheeling form -- as live, interactive, anyone-can-call-in entertainment. (In a promotional tape for America's Talking, Roger Ailes, the channel's president, boasts, "Ours is a forum where anything goes.")
To explain the ascendancy of the genre, it is hard to avoid the cliche "talk is cheap." The comparatively low price of a call-in show -- a host's salary and some phone lines -- makes talk a particularly attractive format at a time when competition for revenues is fierce.
The pressure to produce such economical shows is itself a product of the ongoing upheaval in the communications industry. During the 1980's, many AM radio stations found their sound quality was not good enough to compete with FM stations for music listeners; they turned to talk to survive. (There are more than 800 talk or talk/news stations in the country, double the number five years ago.)
In the 1990's more and more cable television channels have sprung up, while the number of cable viewers has remained stable. Many channels have chosen a strategy that minimizes costs while settling for a smaller market share of the market.
Talk's success on radio is also clearly part of its attraction for television. "Larry King Live!," for example, is one of CNN's highest-rated programs. And anecdotal evidence suggests that C-Span, which does not get ratings, attracts the largest number of viewers during its early morning call-in show.
 
Mad as Heck
 But as television sets out to imitate talk radio, it may discover that it has a generic handicap.
On the radio, call-in culture has become a culture of complaint. The shows are virtual swap meets for discontent -- with the President, with Congress, with the Federal bureaucracy, with foreign governments and with anyone who might be foolhardy enough to defend these institutions. The moments when talk radio has made its power felt most clearly have all been moments of dissatisfaction. They also helped scuttle the 1993 nomination of Zoe Baird for Attorney General.
Talk television is clearly trying to tap into this lode of disaffection. Every weekday, America's Talking offers an hour-long program called "Pork," which, of course, is about wasteful government spending. Also every weekday, the channel offers "Bugged," a show that invites viewers to decry topics that irk them. At the same time, though, none of the channel's shows has a clear ideological bent. Mr. Ailes, producer of the Rush Limbaugh television show, who has been a long-time Republican political consultant, said he did not even know the political leanings of most of the hosts.
"There's nobody ranting and raving on a particular point of view," he said.
That may be part of the problem. Television is fabled as a "cool" medium, radio is known as a "hot" one. TV just doesn't elicit the same fervent indignation that radio does. On a recent episode of "Bugged," for example, Karl called to complain blandly about "slow drivers in the fast lane." Mike called to say "alternative music is seriously bugging me."
Mr. Harrison blames this meekness on the camera: even though callers can't be seen, they feel they can be -- after all, the host is looking right at them. "People are more inhibited on television," he said. "They are less prone to be off the cuff."

HEADLINE: Conversations: Burns W. Roper;
Private Opinions on Public Opinion: Question Is, What Is the Question?

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS 

 BODY:
BEFORE people could instantly register their views by hand-held computers and by calls to "800" and "900" telephone numbers, before street-corner interviews were elevated into "mall intercepts," before Harris and even (if barely) before Gallup, Elmo Burns Roper Jr. pioneered a profession of pulse-takers to whose insistent surveys on products, politics, personalities and popular culture four in 10 adult Americans have responded -- that is, if one recent Roper poll is accurate.
What hath Roper wrought? 
 " 'Polling' -- and that's in quotes -- has been carried to the point of absurdity in many areas," says Burns W. Roper, a lanky 69-year-old Iowa-born Yale dropout who retired earlier this year as chairman of the research organization that his father founded in 1933.
"There are an awful lot of marketing, publicity and media operations that have done some pretty unnecessary and stupid things under the guise of surveys that are wearing people's patience and making it harder to get a representative sample," Mr. Roper says.
While Mr. Roper does not spare himself criticism, his career spanning nearly five decades was distinguished by a reputation for integrity that earned him the respect of his fellow professionals, if not the household recognition of Harris and Gallup. Two things he would rather forget -- the Roper organization's prediction that Thomas E. Dewey would beat President Harry S. Truman in 1948 and a 1992 survey which, because of a fuzzily-worded question, seriously overstated the number of people who doubted the existence of the Holocaust -- were aberrational bookends.
He paused the other day from packing up a career's trove of memorabilia in the midtown Manhattan office of Roper Starch Worldwide to reflect on a profession that has recorded public opinion and sometimes swayed it, too. The Roper Organization, as it was known, was an outgrowth of the market research his father conducted as a jewelry salesman, taking hand-made samples to stores and asking which would sell best.
"That experience made him decide that there was a gap between the executive suite and the people out there to whom they were trying to cater," his son, Bud, said. "Later, he went into election polling to establish polling as an accurate measure. Otherwise, people said, 'You can't tell me you can tell what a nation of 130 million thinks with a 4,000 sample.' He figured the election was a dramatic event that would be the validator of the methodology."
 
A Pivotal Autumn
 It was, in 1936, 1940 and 1944. But not in 1948. "We had four statements that put each candidate in the most favorable light and asked people which was closest to expressing their views," Mr. Roper recalled. "We tried that in August, and even that question had Dewey winning, but by a much smaller margin. Had we stayed with that question, by late October my supposition is it would have shown Truman leading." Nowadays, of course, polling continues almost to Election Eve, but in 1948 it stopped many weeks before. "It was the first case I know of where the polls affected what they were allegedly measuring; what the polls did was make the Republicans complacent," Mr. Roper said. "The unions dragged their supporters to the polls while the fat cats played golf. When we went out a few days after the election and did a poll of people who said they had voted, we had Dewey elected again. The complacent vote told us they had voted, but they hadn't."
Still, Mr. Roper maintains, people are more likely to avoid pollsters than to dissemble. Roper Storch still conducts more of its polls in person than most competitors do. "Psychologically, coming into your home by telephone might be more obtrusive than coming to your door," he says. Even he was stunned, though, by responses to a telephone survey about AIDS: "We talked to Bible Belt 80-year-old widows about anal intercourse. Did we get totally frank answers? Probably not. But we had an amazingly high cooperation rate."
By comparing results of personal interviews with coded secret ballots distributed by the pollsters, the Roper Organization found before the 1960 election that a small percentage of Catholics had been misleading in denying their intention to vote for John F. Kennedy. The 1964 campaign, in which the polls consistently showed Barry Goldwater trailing President Lyndon B. Johnson by a wide margin, made Mr. Roper nervous: "The Goldwater forces talked about their hidden vote, and if you're a pollster, that's scary. because if it's hidden how are you going to find it?" As it turned out, of course, the "hidden vote" remained hidden.
Race is a factor that often worries election pollsters: "I think that there are a lot of white people who will jump into the 'undecided' category in a white-black race when they're not undecided at all -- they're going to vote for the white guy. I don't think it's so much lying as ducking." Regardless of how many liars figure, figures can lie if the sample of respondents is skewed or if the question is loaded or ambiguous, as in a 1992 Roper poll, taken for the American Jewish Committee. The results, which suggested that one in five Americans doubted that the Holocaust had happened, were drawn from a confusing question: "Does it seem possible or does it seem impossible to you that the Nazi extermination of the Jews never happened?" A poll this year asked: "Does it seem possible to you that the Nazi extermination of the Jews never happened, or do you feel certain that it happened?" An analysis of the second poll found that only about 2 percent consistently denied the Holocaust.
 
Other Bad Questions
 "There have been equally bad questions asked in the past, but they were not as sensitive or as publicized," Mr. Roper says. One was whether Richard M. Nixon should be impeached, without ascertaining first whether the people knew what impeachment meant. Another was whether Spiro Agnew would run again for Vice President. "It's like asking people at the beginning of the baseball season who will win the pennant," Mr. Roper says. "There's something sexy about it, and it may have interest in terms of expectations, but not as a predictor."
But don't polls usually support a client's claim? "The others never see the light of day," Mr. Roper says. "Once, after I spoke to a trade association, a lawyer said to me, 'I've never seen a survey that hasn't proved the client's case.' And I said, 'How often have you put a witness on the stand who would demolish your client's case?' "
"You can make a case that polling has been overdone in the past 10 years or so, but better overdone than underdone, because it has made government and manufacturers more sensitive to public needs and desires than they would have been otherwise.
"Should a representative do what he thinks is right or what the people want? That's a much more philosophical political question. Polls are used that way, but I don't think that is the inherent fault of polls. Elected officials used to do it by talking to the ward-heeler or the precinct captain. He'd ask what the people wanted. If a guy is going to operate by being whatever he thinks the public wants, I'd rather have it based on a decent poll than on what two or three people say the public wants." How, Mr. Roper was asked, would he have responded to a Roper poll that once asked people to assess the accuracy of polls?
He paused. "Usually accurate."

HEADLINE: FLIGHT FROM CUBA: THE OVERVIEW;
PRESIDENT MOVES TO PUNISH CASTRO FOR CUBAN EXODUS

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 20

 BODY:
President Clinton today prohibited Americans from sending cash to Cuba and cut off charter flights to the island as part of an effort to bring economic and political pressure on Fidel Castro's already shaky Communist government.
A day after Mr. Clinton shut the main valve of flight for Cubans, the decision to sever other links represented another major change in course in American policy toward Cuba, whose people until now could see the United States as offering salvation. 
 In a statement announcing the new measures, Mr. Clinton made clear that he wanted to punish Mr. Castro and his Government for what he has said is its role in encouraging its citizens to take flight. He said his intent was to limit the Cuban Government from accumulating hard currency, and he registered new disdain for Mr. Castro and his 35-year-old Communist regime.
"The solution to Cuba's many problems is not an uncontrolled exodus," Mr. Clinton said. "It is freedom and democracy for Cuba."
United States officials said the President's order could deprive the Cuban economy of as much as $500 million a year. At the same time, Mr. Clinton and his aides left no doubt that the United States intended to become more aggressive in using radio and television broadcasts and the support of other nations to pressure Mr. Castro and his government.
Among the new steps outlined today by Mr. Clinton and his aides is a plan to use American military aircraft to augment Radio Marti by beaming radio and television broadcasts to Cuba. The federally supported Radio Marti, which is known to have a sizable audience on the island, has already begun broadcasts telling Cubans of the latest policy change. Dick Lobo of the Office of Cuba Broadcasting, which runs Radio Marti and TV Marti, said both were broadcasting translations of Mr. Clinton's declaration every 15 minutes.
Despite those broadcasts, the Coast Guard picked up 1,074 Cubans at sea by midnight, a third of the total who came to the United States in 1993.
Mr. Clinton also said that he planned to enlist the United Nations in calling attention to human rights abuses in Cuba.
A senior Administration official today portrayed the new policy as representing nothing more than "a response to unfolding events." The official would not say if it was intended to foment rebellion in Cuba among those the United States is now seeking to dissuade from taking to the sea.
If it was being driven largely by the pressures of the moment, the new plan may also set in motion a risky endgame to a standoff that began in 1959, not long after Mr. Castro seized control of the island nation that lies just 90 miles from Florida.
But the effect of a policy crafted in response to this week's refugee crisis also appeared likely to compound the misery of the same Cubans whose plight the Government until Friday seemed determined to cushion.
Whether by climbing aboard rickety rafts or relying on money sent from abroad, Cubans could always count on generous holes in the cordon erected by the United States after Mr. Castro took power. Now in a staccato of new steps, Mr. Clinton has closed the door -- not just to refugees but to flights and cash shipments sent by Cuban exiles southward.
For Mr. Clinton and his aides, fearful of what a new tide of Cubans would carry to American shores, the main virtue of the cold shoulder is its role as a repellent, or what the White House calls "demagnetization."
By supplanting visions of Miami with those of rough tents and cots at an American base at Guantanamo Bay, the Administration hopes to keep Cubans from deciding that the rewards of flight are worth the great risks. At the same time, by announcing steps aimed at the Castro regime, Mr. Clinton moved to insulate himself from political critics who said that in focusing on problems borne by the refugees, he was addressing the symptom of Cuba's ills and ignoring its cause.
 
Compounding Problems
 If the Cubans can indeed be kept from setting to sea, some Administration officials say, their bottled-up discontent is bound to compound Mr. Castro's problems and perhaps hasten Mr. Castro's fall.
As the flood of refugees began to swell, Gov. Lawton Chiles of Florida, a fellow Democrat, had asked that Mr. Clinton declare a state of emergency to help his state. But Mr. Clinton, who paid an enormous political price as Governor of Arkansas after the Mariel boatlift in 1980 when Cuban prisoners rioted at a military base in his state, sought instead to prevent a repeat of the exodus.
Although just 500 Cubans a day were being rescued at midweek, Mr. Clinton's concern was the 125,000 Cubans in the Mariel flotilla. Faced with a similar peril this spring when thousands of desperate Haitians set to the sea, his Administration managed to stem the flow by making clear that those who were rescued would not be allowed into the United States.
Even if it meant an end to 28 years of American policy, Mr. Clinton was willing to apply the same step to Cubans. In an era when Americans have grown more resentful of immigrants and refugee flows have become a powerful force in shaping American policy toward not just Haiti and Cuba, but Rwanda, Bosnia and other trouble spots, Mr. Clinton's aides say, he has learned the virtue of "demagnetizing" the United States.
 
Gradual Shift?
 Senior Administration officials who played a central role in the decision insisted today that the changes of course had been under consideration for weeks, in part to silence complaints that Haitians deserved the same treatment, and that it appeared sudden only because the planning was secret to minimize the prospect that Cubans might rush to sea before the welcome mat was withdrawn.
Mr. Clinton has long supported the embargo against Cuba, whose terms were first spelled out in 1963. He also supported the Cuban Democracy Act of 1992, which tightened the embargo while holding out the prospect of further assistance.
Aides to Mr. Clinton who shared details of the changes on Friday evening first said the State Department would announce them in a statement later that night. But other White House officials vetoed that plan, deciding that to maximize the political impact, the President himself would make the announcement this morning.
Among the steps to tighten the embargo, the most drastic is the new ban on sending cash to Cuba. Until now, each American household has been permitted to send $300 per quarter to Cuban citizens, an exemption allowing allow Cuban exiles to provide some help to their relatives.
But Administration officials, who first decided merely to cut that allowance in half, to $150 a quarter, said today that they had decided to eliminate it altogether after Cuban-American leaders who met with Mr. Clinton at the White House on Friday night told him they would embrace such a step. The Treasury Department could authorize specific exceptions if the money was to be used for humanitarian purposes.
A senior White House official involved in the discussions made clear that the step, like a new cutoff on charter flights and efforts to call attention to human rights abuses, was aimed at the Castro regime, which has established hard-currency stores to attract American dollars. "These shipments have clearly been a source of hard cash for Cuba, and we didn't want to be in a position of bankrolling a further exodus," the official said.

HEADLINE: Brazil Is Now Leading Foreign Supplier of Handguns to the U.S.

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PORTO ALEGRE, Brazil

 BODY:
With taxes and permit requirements hurting sales at home, Brazilian handgun manufacturers are increasing exports, making their country the leading foreign supplier of handguns to the United States.
"The U.S. is now our largest market," said Carlos Alberto Murgel, president of Brazil's largest handgun manufacturer, Forjas Taurus S. A. Taurus now accounts for about 10 percent of all handguns sold in the United States. 
 With highly efficient assembly lines in this southern city, Brazil's largest handgun manufacturers feed American demand for reliable, inexpensive guns. The American market receives about 75 percent of Taurus exports and about one half of the production of Brazil's second-largest handgun maker, Amadeo Rossi S. A.
According to one recent survey, Brazil exports 775,000 handguns a year -- three times the number sold annually in this country of 160 million people.
The spread of Brazilian-made handguns was underscored in April when Mexican police officials identified a .38-caliber Taurus revolver as the weapon used to kill Mexico's leading presidential candidate, Luis Donaldo Colosio. The gun trail passes through a California gun shop to a Porto Alegre assembly line.
Here in this gray workaday city, in the southeastern corner of Brazil nearly 700 miles from Rio de Janeiro, Taurus managers have applied the driving business techniques of industrialized countries to transform a dusty, 55-year-old company.
Benefiting from a recent $20 million investment in new machinery, Taurus assembly lines churned out almost half a million handguns last year. Of these, about 230,000 went to the United States. Rossi, the only other Brazilian handgun exporter, has 3 percent of the United States market.
The importance of the American market to gun makers is as clear as the plaque on Mr. Murgel's office wall: "If guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns."
Because the Brazilian Government does not agree with that philosophy, Mr. Murgel has made exports the key to growth at his company. Last year, 80 percent of Taurus's $85 million in sales were to overseas markets.
At home, a thicket of regulations discourages legal handgun ownership.
With taxes accounting for nearly 75 percent of Brazilian sales prices for guns, Taurus revolvers are often twice as expensive here as in Miami. In addition, many Brazilian states require waiting periods before handgun purchases. After submitting proof of fixed residence and employment, a buyer has to wait up to two weeks for a criminal record check.
In Rio de Janeiro, to get a permit to carry a handgun, an applicant must submit character references from three neighbors, results of medical and psychiatric tests and a certificate from a police firearms course.
Responding to public nervousness about firearms and crime, Rio's Mayor, Cesar Maia, decreed in January a ban on all gun sales in Rio. The ban was ruled unconstitutional.
Brazilian civilians are not allowed to carry handguns more powerful than a .38-caliber pistol. As a result, the Taurus line of high-powered weapons is almost entirely for export.
Because of these and other restrictions, an estimated 400 small gun shops in Brazil have closed since 1990, the year Brazil entered a sharp recession.
To guarantee access to the American market, Taurus has become a Brazilian multinational company, operating a subsidiary plant in Miami: Taurus International Manufacturing Inc.
"My fear is that things will go too far in one direction," Mr. Murgel said when asked if he worried that controls will tighten on handgun sales in the United States.
"We arms manufacturers are not criminals," he said. "We make a product that could be a deterrent to crime."

HEADLINE: Siberia: 5 Million Miles of Frozen Dreams

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SPECTER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: YAKUTSK, Russia

 BODY:
They shot it out at noon, not long after a hard summer rain had turned the city roads to mud. By the time the turf battle for one of Siberia's wildest outposts had ended, two gang leaders lay dead, six others were on their way to the hospital, and this untamed city -- filled with enough strivers, gamblers, con men and thieves to make Dodge City seem like Larchmont -- had taken one step closer to anarchy.
"This has always been a crazy place but it sure is getting wilder," said Rima Yakovleva, a 28-year-old fur trader whose friend was killed in the shootout this month. "When people say freedom is dangerous in Russia I think I know what they mean. Because no place is freer or more dangerous than Siberia." 
 She may be right. Siberia has always been animated by a frontier spirit, a combustible blend of danger and possibility. Bigger than anyplace on earth -- it would take India, the United States and much of Western Europe to fill it up -- the region stretching roughly from the Urals to the Sea of Okhotsk has for centuries produced suffering and dread on a scale practically unrivaled in the world. Siberia: the word itself has become a synonym for isolation, exile and despair.
Yet Siberia is not a simple, or even a single, place these days. It is the most reactionary part of Russia, and the most open. Democracy, opportunity and entrepreneurial adventure are rapidly on the rise. So are poverty, desolation and rage.
A speculator would drool over the natural treasures that lie beneath the frozen earth here: more diamonds, more gold, more silver, tin, lumber and oil than anywhere in the world. Yet thousands of northern villages established to mine that wealth are dying. Millionaires with car phones carry their rubles in huge bricks. Yet there may never have been a time, not even when Stalin turned Siberia into one of history's biggest prison camps, when more people here have lived with less hope for the future.
Nowhere are the complicated chords of the emerging Russia more evident than here in central Siberia, where most homes lack running water and rich young men cruise the unpaved roadways in $40,000 Jeeps.
Yakutia -- with the world's biggest coal fields, much of the oil in the former Soviet Union and nearly all of its diamonds and tin -- has as much promise for development as any place in a Russia hungry for exports. But local newspapers are filled with advertisements from people so desperate to get out that they are offering to trade large apartments for a single container to box and ship their possessions to Moscow.
"There are just not many reasons for being optimistic about Siberia," said Aleksei A. Tomtosov, the Mayor of Yakutsk, which with 200,000 residents is the largest city in Yakutia, a 1.2-million-square-mile region.
"People have been sent here with promises that have not been kept," Mr. Tomtosov said. "Food is three times more expensive here than in Moscow. Every trained person who can get a job somewhere else is leaving. I know a lot of people are making money here now, but I think more are losing everything they believed in. I don't think anybody had any idea the free market could be so cruel."
 
The Lure
Diamonds Glitter In the Permafrost
 It is in the "North," an often majestically unkempt, seemingly unbroken expanse of tundra and permafrost that covers the top two-thirds of Russia, where the new realities of the nation have perhaps been most painful. Until two years ago, nearly 11 million people lived here, mostly in thousands of small mining towns set up by the Soviets to harness the wealth of the land east of the Urals. But at least a million have fled since then, and officials here and in Moscow worry that another million will leave in the next year.
Many of the region's aging residents were lured there during the glory days of Communism with promises of extra pay, fancy vacations, subsidized food and a guaranteed pension after 15 years of work. They followed their ideals and what was called "the long ruble," the extra money and prestige that went with the extra hardships.
"You came here and you were special," said Aleksandr I. Gritskevich, a 45-year-old police officer in Verkhoyansk, a particularly bleak Arctic town that is most famous for its claim of registering the lowest temperature ever recorded in a settled place (90.04 degrees below zero, Fahrenheit).
Like many northern villages, the town, 400 miles north of Yakutsk, is a monument to abandoned Soviet dreams. There is a half-built day care center, a pile of bricks that was going to be a bakery and an empty space for the new school.
"It just fell apart a couple of years back," Mr. Gritskevich said. "All of a sudden it was like we were dead."
 
Towns Built on Hope
 As long as the promises held, the privations had all seemed worth it. Frontier towns like Verkhoyansk, Sangar, and Komsomolsk-on-Amur were cobbled together with wood beams and blind hope. The deal was simple: survive the coldest weather in the world, harvest the oil fields, mines and rivers, and live the communist good life back in the European part of the country forever after. The deal held for at least two decades.
But it is over now. Investment is rapidly falling in these remote towns, largely because they cost way too much to support in any rational economy. Almost nothing grows on the icy ground, so everything -- apples, milk, tomatoes, clothes -- must be imported. Vodka, even more essential here than in most parts of Russia, costs about $7 a bottle, or four times what it costs in Moscow. It costs almost $17 a gram to extract gold from Siberian mines, compared with $13 to purchase a gram on the open market. It doesn't take Karl Marx or Milton Friedman to figure out the implications of that kind of economics.
Salaries remain higher than in other parts of the country, but few people are working these days and fewer of them are still getting paid. Without the type of subsidies that existed in the past, nobody knows how to keep these cities alive.
 
Workers Held Hostage
 "This is a catastrophic situation," said Vladimir Sturov, a member of the Russian Parliament from Siberia. "The people in the north are literally hostages. They have been invited there by the state and now we can't get them out."
When the Soviet Union started to fall apart, Siberia, always fiercely individualistic, was among the first places to proclaim its independence. Regions like Yakutia, Magadan and Khabarovsk began to think about setting up a separate republic. They saw "Russia," as they still call the European part of the country, as a big government that did little for them but fritter away their great wealth or turn it into dollars for other people.
Although the calls for secession have faded away, there is some truth to the complaint: even last year the Russian far north produced 15 percent of the country's gross national product but almost 60 percent of its hard currency earnings.
"People here are living through one of the greatest betrayals in Russian history," said Tamara S. Shamshurina, editor of the newspapers Success and Youth of Yakutia, who has spent her life in the region and has no desire to leave it. "They are not getting what they deserve. They are stranded, living like animals, without a hope in the world."
 
The Reality
Cellular Phones And Outhouses
 There is a hope of course: the marketplace. It has already begun to work in the Far East. In Khabarovsk, near the Manchurian border, restaurant and hotel toilets have automatic heating sensors, there are satellite telephones in the airport, and cellular phones are for sale on the street. Only 200 miles away, though, in Komsomolsk-on-Amur, there are virtually no public toilets and people still have to wait in line at the central post office to get permission to place a telephone call out of the city.
In Yakutsk, perhaps the most adventurous of Siberian cities, hundreds of young entrepreneurs from Russia and many other countries are eager to develop the land, harvest the forests, build factories, housing and cities. There are diamond and gold stores all along the main street, but almost no other street in town is paved. Water pumps are still the norm, and wooden outhouses are used by the vast majority of people.
Even now, Yakutsk has the look of a boom town during the California Gold Rush. It is said to be the only city in the world built completely on permafrost, the ice that sits permanently beneath the soil, so shiny insulated pipes thread surreally through the air, buildings stand on concrete pylons, and the Lena River freezes solid by the first of October when temperatures begin their mind-boggling plunge below zero.
But none of that stops the diehards. Despite annual interest rates at banks that have inched beyond 200 percent, there are many "players" in town -- people eager to get diamonds, gold or phosphate out of the ground. It is a place with a million schemes, where fast talk can make you rich in a week, or get you killed in a minute. And now, it is a place where economic realities, and the new gangs, rule.
 
Survival of Economic Fittest
 A few weeks ago the first car dealership in town was burned to the ground right before its grand opening. Nobody considered it an accident. In most cases, though, the rules are clear: if a project has merit it can succeed; if a city should die it will.
"Moving to solid economics, to a market, has been a very difficult thing for all of us," said Viktor S. Budishchev, president of Olivico, a successful new conglomerate here that deals in everything from Volvo car parts to construction cranes.
"But we have done it and we all have to do it," he said. "We have to take this place, Siberia, that was set up in the most irrational way by the Soviets, and we have to make some sense of it. That means many of the cities they constructed simply should not be. The market can make these decisions better than we can."
Mr. Budishchev conceded that the death of such towns was "painful for all those who live there, a catastrophe of course." But, he added, "if they can't sustain themselves in a real economy what should we do about it?"
 
The Future
Moscow Fiddles As Siberia Freezes
 For Siberia that is the ultimate question: What should we do about it? Despite its depressing reputation, the promise of the region, even its stark beauty, is obvious to anyone who has been there. But Moscow is not doing a thing to encourage the free market to flourish, so the people who get ahead are those who hustle the fast buck.
New import taxes and duties were imposed across the nation on July 1. In Alaska and in Canada's Northwest Territories -- comparably difficult places to invest and work -- there are long lists of tax incentives for companies willing to brave the frontier. Russia permits no such thing.
Experts say that while many cities exist where it makes no sense for people to live -- on the frigid permafrost, deep into the Arctic Circle, on rivers that freeze 8 months a year -- there are ways of turning big profits in Siberia. The main one is simple: instead of erecting huge, inefficient towns that need to be heated and fed from the west all winter, it would be better to rotate mining crews the way they do on oil rigs in the North Sea.
 
Promises Broken or Ignored
 "The Russians know all this," said Ronald W. Miller, a lawyer based in Alaska who represents several mining, fishing and timber concerns scattered across Siberia.
The Government has acknowledged the difficulties in working in Siberia, pledging tax breaks and subsidies to enterprises. But so far none have materialized. This year, the Russian Parliament cut subsidies to the northern territories nearly in half, from 9.5 trillion rubles to 5.5 trillion rubles, making it even more difficult for workers there to feel that the Government is committed to them.
"I just don't think they give a damn," Mr. Miller said. "Everyone talks about the problems of making money in Siberia. Well there is really one problem: the Government doesn't want anybody to do it. The technology is there for getting these gems out of the ground. There are companies that know how to and want to do it. We are here because, well, like they say, there's gold in them hills. But everyone has a breaking point. In Siberia its tough to reach, but if somebody doesn't pay attention a lot of people are going to reach it soon."

HEADLINE: To Change or Not to Change? Mexicans Are Voting Today

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Aug. 20

 BODY:
How much change do Mexicans want?
The question has echoed throughout the presidency of Carlos Salinas de Gortari, asked again and again as he dismantled a protectionist, state-run economy, toppled idols of the 1910 Revolution, and moved under rising pressure to cede some of his party's authoritarian control of the political system. 
 As they prepared to choose a successor to Mr. Salinas on Sunday, many Mexicans appeared fed up with the Institutional Revolutionary Party, which has held power for 65 years. Peasant rebels in southern Chiapas State threatened new fighting if the election was not clean. Middle-class housewives complained of crime and corruption that seemed only to rise, along with their taxes.
But while opponents have tested the party called the PRI as never before, much of the anger that threatened to topple it only a few months ago seems to have been tempered, much of the frustration put aside. If several of the opinion polls are to be believed, the governing party candidate, Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, leads his closest competitor by roughly 20 points.
 
'Reluctant to Change'
 "People report that things are worse, or that if they are not worse for them personally, they perceive them as being worse in general," said John Bailey, an expert on Mexican politics who heads the Latin American studies department at Georgetown University in Washington. "And yet they are reluctant to change; they are afraid of change."
With the polls carefully taken but their validity uncertain, and about a fifth of the voters saying they are undecided, opposition politicians have insisted that a surprise is not out of the question. But Mr. Zedillo's two main rivals showed little sign of gathering momentum as the race came to an end.
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the somber leftist leader who broke from the PRI seven years ago, has campaigned vigorously and with a far better organization than he had in 1988, when many Mexicans believe he was robbed of victory.
The crowds he has drawn have appeared outsized given his modest support in the polls. He has already called on his supporters to take to the streets Monday, threatening demonstrations if the vote is clouded by fraud. But with Mr. Cardenas getting barely 10 percent backing in recent surveys, few independent analysts still count him in the race.
The candidate of the right-of-center National Action Party, Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, has held on to about twice the support of Mr. Cardenas with a campaign promising, "The only change that's safe."
But after surging forward in the polls by battering Mr. Zedillo in the country's first debate among major presidential candidates, on May 12, Mr. Fernandez almost vanished from public view, campaigning infrequently while he said he was preparing for a second debate, which never took place.
 
Does He Want to Win?
 The combative, supremely confident man who began to persuade many Mexicans that the PRI might finally be beaten has never quite returned. His rallies have often been small, his presence on the hustings lackluster. Some of his supporters have questioned whether the former congressman, a key opposition supporter of Mr. Salinas's economic and political reforms, really wants to win.
Although the PRI campaign may have been hurt by widespread suspicions that hard-line elements of the party may have had a role in the assassination in March of its first presidential candidate, Luis Donaldo Colosio, Mr. Zedillo has continued to fight with overwhelming advantages.
Having lost badly in the first debate, Mr. Zedillo avoided a promised rematch. Even with many PRI members unenthusiastic about his candidacy, the party has cranked up its formidable machine again, marshaling the energies of hundreds of thousands of Mexicans whose livelihood depends on its power.
In a final report on the election campaign, the country's most prominent observer group, Civic Alliance, said on Friday that the conditions for a fair and reliable contest "have not existed nor do they exist yet." Today, the group made public samples of what it said were huge stacks of blank copies of the backs of voter registration cards. The copies, discovered by accident in a Mexico City print shop, appeared to have been produced so people could alter their cards to vote repeatedly.
On Thursday in the west coast town of Coyuca de Benitez, foreign election observers reported the sort of scene that has continued to blur the lines between the PRI and the Government, new laws and all.
 
The Message Is Clear
 As heavily armed policemen surrounded the town plaza and military helicopters and planes buzzed overhead, hundreds of peasants lined up to receive subsidy checks from a Government agricultural program, the leader of an observer team, Eric F. Quezada, said. Political parties were barred from campaigning after Wednesday and the program itself has been prohibited from advertising in the weeks before the vote, but the message was nonetheless clear: Vote for the PRI and continue to cash in.
For all of his dependence on the powers of incumbency, however, Mr. Zedillo has by no means run on Mr. Salinas's record.
For instance, Mr. Zedillo, a former Minister of the Budget and of Education, has scarely mentioned the North American Free Trade Agreement, the trophy that only last fall seemed to represent sure Mexican steps toward the developed world. With discontent rife in the countryside, Mr. Zedillo has also appeared to evade discussion of some of the most contentious changes of the Salinas Administration, including the cancellation of the revolution's standing promise of land for peasants.
Instead, Mr. Zedillo has laid out proposals for changes in the economy, social programs, the environment and the corrupt legal system. And in an election in which Mexicans under the age of 40 make up 63.3 percent of the eligible voters, the 42-year-old Yale-educated economist has begun to strike even some of his critics as the most experienced and forward-looking man in the race.
 
'Civil Society' on the Move
 Mr. Zedillo himself has played only lightly on the fears of Mexicans, mostly by accusing Mr. Cardenas of threatening violence. But other PRI leaders have been less subtle. In some areas where opposition support is strong, recent army sweeps have also been understood by many people as an ominous message of what might happen should the PRI lose.
Carlos Arevalo, 30, a truck driver who lives near the western city of Guadalajara, said he had heard Mr. Salinas promise to hand over power to whoever won a fair vote but put more stock in reports of the army getting new helicopters, of big troop deployments in the countryside, and of 500 assault rifles disappearing from a stockpile in the coastal city of Puerto Vallarta.
"There will be a war if the PRI does not win, and if there is a war, nobody is going to turn over anything to anyone," Mr. Arevalo predicted, saying he would vote for the governing party despite his stronger sympathies for the conservative opposition. "If the PRI wins, people will be out in the streets, but there will be fewer of them."
Such images clash with others of the campaign: tens of thousands of volunteers spreading out around the country to observe the vote; "citizen magistrates" taking over the federal elections board from the Government; delegates trooping into the rain forest for a "National Democratic Convention" organized by the rebels in Chiapas; politicians and intellectuals of different ideologies joining to press for further democratic reforms.
"Ahead of the parties, beyond the elections, what is on the move in Mexico is civil society," the novelist Carlos Fuentes wrote in an article published today in the Mexico City newspaper La Jornada.
 
Cynicism Still Prevails
 The surge of citizen involvement in the elections is indeed remarkable for a country in which important political decisions have been left largely to bargaining among elites since the last clearly free election in 1911. Yet from conversations with hundreds of voters in recent months and the polls that have registered their most important concerns, the movement in support of democracy appears still an incipient counterweight to the cynicism with which many Mexicans look on their politics.
"Imagine!" demanded Hector Arias, 25, a salesman hanging out in front of his squat row house in a working-class Guadalajara neighborhood. "These guys in power are rich and they steal! What would the others, who are poor, do if they take over? If there is real change, we will be in trouble."
Standing nearby, a friend of Mr. Arias, a 46-year-old butcher named Nestor Melgarejo, begged to differ.
"We are in trouble now," he insisted. "Who doesn't have three jobs? Who has enough to eat? What we are now is in trouble!"
So why wouldn't Mr. Melgarejo be voting for Mr. Fernandez, whom he described as his favorite candidate?
"The Congress will still be controlled by the PRI," the butcher reasoned. "All the bureaucracy will still be of the PRI. They would wipe him out."
 
Some Shared Pledges
 In fact, many analysts believe the PRI is far more likely to lose its control over the Congress than it is the presidency. Depending on its magnitude, such a loss could turn the legislature, long a rubber stamp for executive decisions, into a forum of real influence over Government policy.
Less directly, the probability that the next President will not receive a majority vote could force whoever takes office to follow through on the main candidates' shared pledges to cede more power to state governments and the judiciary and to include rival parties in the next Cabinet.
"Just as they opened us up to competition from abroad, they are going to have to face more political competition in this country," one of Mexico's most powerful industrialists, who asked not to be identified, said this week in the northern city of Monterrey. "That is going to force them to take decisions more carefully, to be less arbitrary. The PRI may remain in power, but it will remain there only because people want it to."

National Action Party
Partido Accion Nacional
 
Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, 53.
A civil litigation lawyer who has long been involved in politics, Fernandez served in the Mexican Congress from 1991 until this year. He was one of the most vocal opposition leaders negotiating with the Government over economic and other reforms instituted by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
Fernandez surged into contention with a strong performance in the country's first-ever presidential debate, on May 12, but faded in late June and July, campaigning infrequently and failing to press for an expected second debate.
Fernandez is associated with the PAN's most socially conservative wing, and his strong opposition to the legalization of abortion has been an issue in the campaign. He has sharply criticized Government economic policy, calling for greater social spending and more competition, particularly among newly privatized banks.
 
Democratic Revolutionary Party
Partido de la Revolucion Democratica
 
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano, 60
Cardenas led a four-party leftist coalition in the 1988 election that won more than 30 percent of the vote. In 1989 he helped found the P.R.D., which has become Mexico's strongest leftist party.
During his two campaigns, Cardenas has called for the Government to be more active in distributing wealth, although in recent months he has embraced more free-market policies.
He is the son of a national hero and former President, Lazaro Cardenas del Rio. Before splitting with the goerning party in 1987, Cardenas was Governor of the state of Michoacan and a federal Senator. He graduated from the National Autonomous University of Mexico in 1956 with a degree in civil engineering; in the early 1970's he directed a steel plant bearing his father's name.
 
Institutional Revolutionary Party
Partido Revolucionario Institucional
 
Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, 42,
Zedillo is the former campaign manager for Luis Donaldo Colosio Murrieta, the former PRI candidate, who was assassinated on March 23.
As one of the principal technocrats of the Salinas Administration, he helped develop and carry out sweeping economic reforms over the last five years. He served as the Education Minister from 1992-1993, and Planning and Budget Minister from 1988-1992. Zedillo has pledged to continue the economic policies of the Salinas Administration and separate the ruling party from the Government.
He received a doctorate from Yale University in economics in 1978, writing his dissertation on managing government debt. During his four-month campaign, he has stressed his working-class origins: he grew up in the border city of Mexicali, Baja California, where his father was an electrician.

HEADLINE: FLIGHT FROM CUBA: IN CUBA;
Cuba Assails Clinton on Guantanamo Detentions

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: HAVANA, Aug. 20

 BODY:
Cuba accused President Clinton of planning a "concentration camp" at Guantanamo Bay, where American officials are detaining rafters seeking to enter the United States.
A Foreign Ministry statement said Cuba strongly rejected the United States use of the Guantanamo Bay base, on Cuba's southeast tip, to house Cuban refugees. Washington had decided to add to a "dangerous situation," the statement said, referring to some 15,000 Haitian boat people already camped at the base and to previous protests by Havana over this use of the base. 
 The statement also repeated Cuba's longstanding claim that the base, on land leased to the United States early this century, is an illegal occupation of Cuban territory.
Despite Mr. Clinton's announcement of a new policy of turning away refugees, dozens of Cubans continued to set out to sea from at least one spot, Cojimar, east of the Cuban capital.
The town, 10 miles from Havana, has been a focal point for the recent surge in Cubans leaving by sea. The rise is apparently because Cuban authorities have begun turning a blind eye to people trying to leave the island, so long as they set off in their own vessel.
 
A $1,500 Raft
 On Friday night, small crowds of people milled around Cojimar's rocky shore as they have done for the last few days, preparing rafts or watching the latest departure. One man wandered around offering a raft for sale for $1,500.
Most people, asked about why they are undertaking such a perilous journey, cite economic reasons, saying they are fed up with battling severe shortages amid Cuba's current economic crisis. Many of those who leave are young men.
People on the beach at Cojimar seemed unconcerned by the prospect of going to the Guantanamo Bay base. Some seemed not to believe they would be sent to there. Others said that they would press ahead anyway with their plans.

HEADLINE: THE HEALTH CARE DEBATE: WASHINGTON AT WORK;
Budget Director, the Conscience of Congress, Turns Ideas Into Dollar Signs

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 20

 BODY:
There are moments in this final phase of the health care struggle when people yearn, just a little, for the old leap-of-faith days of policy-making. Before the Congressional Budget Office was tallying up the costs, the risks and the impact on the deficit of every good intention.
Robert D. Reischauer, the 53-year-old director of the budget office, is smack in the center of the legislative action these days. Mr. Reischauer, a tall, ascetic-looking economist, strides from the meetings of the "mainstream coalition" in the Senate to the huddles of the Democratic leaders in the House. He and his 20 health analysts are supposed to function as a careful, wary superego in the Congressional psyche. (Do you realize the subsidies it takes to reduce the number of uninsured from 15 to 10 percent of the population? Do you recognize the difficulty in turning over vast new regulatory responsibilities to the states?) 
 Lawmakers look to the budget office as an arbiter in a terrifyingly complicated, fiercely partisan debate. But the C.B.O. has also become a target as the effort to pass a health care bill comes dangerously close to running out of time -- and as more and more of what is left is spent "waiting for C.B.O. estimates." Has the budget office become the latest institution to be overwhelmed by the health care struggle?
"Overwhelmed would imply we're flailing around," Mr. Reischauer said in an interview on Thursday night in his office at the foot of Capitol Hill. "And we aren't flailing around. We're working long hours, without relief, but not overwhelmed. The task is monumental, and the time frame that people would like to have our analyses in is very short."
At that moment, Mr. Reischauer and his staff were responsible for analyzing three thick health care plans in the House and the principal Republican plan in the Senate. House Democratic leaders had just announced that they might have to put off debate and floor action on health care until after Labor Day -- a move that dismayed many advocates of health care restructuring -- because they had yet to receive the necessary estimates from the C.B.O.
 
Keeping a Nightmare at Bay
 On Thursday morning, Mr. Reischauer and a few top aides provided guidance to the "mainstream group" in the Senate, meeting with them in their crowded clubhouse in the Capitol. ("It's like an Indian sweat lodge," Mr. Reischauer said. "Twenty-five senators in their shirtsleeves, roasting hot, probably 45 or 50 staff hanging off the walls.")
Then, topping off the workload, he was asked, as of Thursday evening, to analyze 93 amendments to the Democratic health bill on the floor of the Senate. All of this, of course, concerns one-seventh of the American economy.
"I guess my worst nightmare would be that some poorly thought-out plan is passed, and the American people would greet that plan with tremendous dissatisfaction, and it's repealed two years from now," Mr. Reischauer said.
The C.B.O. was created during the Nixon Administration, largely because Congress wanted its own -- rather than the Administration's -- analyses of the budget, along with various policy and fiscal alternatives. Over the years, its responsibilities have grown, but it has never tackled a job as big as restructuring the health care system -- and neither has Congress.
His admirers describe Mr. Reischauer's office as an invaluable, impartial umpire in a debate that badly needs one. "Their own success has created the problem," said Representative Barbara B. Kennelly, Democrat of Connecticut and a member of the Ways and Means Committee. "People believe their numbers."
 
Bottleneck or Whipping Boy?
 But some lawmakers complain that time after time, during committee deliberations and the move to the floor, the struggle to produce a health care bill has been slowed while everyone waits for the C.B.O. to analyze one hot idea or another. "I'm sympathetic to the problem of a small organization asked to do 20 different iterations all at once," said Representative Jim McDermott, Democrat of Washington and another influential member of Ways and Means. But he added, "They are the plug."
There is, on the other hand, considerable suspicion that the budget office is a convenient whipping boy for Democratic leaders who are not ready to bring their bill to the floor because they do not have the votes. There are ample reasons for the House to wait, like the exhausting, utterly distracting fight over the crime bill and the persistent desire among backbenchers to let the Senate go first on health.
A few things are clear: In both houses, the Democratic majority leaders have been struggling to find a consensus on health care and, as a result, have presented their plans much later than expected.
"Don't blame C.B.O.," said Representative Pete Stark, chairman of the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health. "It's my colleagues who can't decide what they want to do."
Moreover, rival plans and rump groups have endured -- and even, at this late stage, proliferated -- thus generating further demands for C.B.O. analyses. "Who would have thought that everybody would have their own plan?" Mrs. Kennelly said.
Finally, C.B.O. analyses have been slowed down because legislation keeps getting revised, rewritten and revamped even after it is presented to the budget office. Mr. Reischauer, a man of utmost delicacy when talking about Members of Congress, and particularly the leaders, said, "We provide a preliminary set of numbers, which often makes the sponsor of the plan want to make adjustments to the plan because sometimes it costs more than the sponsor anticipates."
He added, with a small smile: "There are components of these plans that are provided by other committees, for example: 'Here, Mr. Leader, this won't cost anything.' And it gets tucked into the bill. And then you say, 'Sorry, it's not quite that way. This provision for Indians or rural health or veterans that you haven't been paying careful attention to costs a lot more than you anticipated.' "
So the sponsor of the bill changes that element and resubmits the proposal for analysis. The numbers are run through anew, and the C.B.O. people move on to another element of the bill. In other words, the author of the legislation can have considerable control over how long it takes to analyze the bill.
"Absolutely," Mr. Reischauer said. "The interactive process, in effect, can go on forever."
Still, there is a widespread sense on Capitol Hill that the C.B.O. is simply understaffed for a job this big. Aides close to the Democratic leadership in both houses say that the issue was raised with Mr. Reischauer and that discussions focused on the idea of hiring new people or even subcontracting out some work. Mr. Reischauer said his current budget had been developed long before anyone could have anticipated this last-minute logjam.
By spring, when Democratic leaders and their staff recognized the problem that was developing, Mr. Reischauer said, it was too late "to suddenly shift gears" and contract with outside groups. Consistency -- the knowledge that every plan is being analyzed by the same set of people using the same assumptions -- is at the heart of the budget office's credibility, he argued.
 
Peering Into the Future
 The economist, trained at Harvard and Columbia, takes his nightmare scenario of a vast failure in health policy very seriously; throughout Mr. Reischauer's analyses of the various proposals, from President Clinton's to that of Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the majority leader, runs a note of caution, a warning that nobody can truly foresee the consequences, intended and unintended, of policy-making at this scale.
But he also worries, he said, about too much caution in the modern era of policy-making. "We've become obsessed in this country with the budgetary impacts of policies," Mr. Reischauer said. "We're in a sense paying for the sins of our predecessors, who didn't worry at all about these things, and as a result we're left with gaping budget deficits.
"But it is a concern that the first test that has to be met is a budgetary test. And often that appears to be the only test that people are concerned with, rather than the notion that we should fashion responsible, progressive social policy that might solve the serious problems our society faces."
It is a variation of the argument made by Hillary Rodham Clinton, who mused to reporters last week that President Franklin D. Roosevelt "didn't have to carry around actuarial tables and then have arguments with people on television."
Mr. Reischauer, on this quiet Thursday night, did not have to think very long about the argument the modern "policy analysis world" would have presented against Social Security. "People would have said, 'Why, this is going to cause many able-bodied working 68-year-old men to drop out of the labor force!' "
A budgetary worldview, in other words, can carry a Congress only so far.

HEADLINE: Tax-Exempt Bonds Issued for Renovation at Kennedy

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

 BODY:
Continuing New York City's efforts to help renovate aging terminals at Kennedy International Airport, the administration of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has issued $83 million in tax-exempt bonds to help American Airlines pay for the renovation and expansion of its passenger terminal.
The financing agreement, with the city's Industrial Development Agency, will enable the airline to complete a multimillion-dollar project it began in 1989 to rebuild its terminal and one next to it. 
 The agreement, announced yesterday by the Mayor's office, follows the announcement last month that a consortium of four foreign airlines had agreed to build the first new passenger terminal at Kennedy in more than two decades. The development agency also agreed to sell $435 million in bonds to raise money for that project.
In a statement, Mr. Giuliani praised the agreement with American, saying that it would create about 400 jobs and that it could encourage other airlines to rebuild at Kennedy, which is owned by the city and leased to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
 
Investing in Infrastructure
 "This kind of investment in our infrastructure by private industry is crucial to maintaining our franchise as a leader in transportation technology and efficiency," the Mayor said.
Under the agreement, the development agency sold the bonds on Aug. 2 on behalf of the airline, which must pay them off when they mature in 2024. The agency, part of the city's Economic Development Corporation, is a public nonprofit corporation that authorizes tax-exempt financing for manufacturers and other private companies to expand, renovate or buy new buildings in the city.
Michael W. Gunn, the senior vice president of marketing for American, said in the statement that the financing would allow the airline to expand its terminal by 340,000 square feet, adding five new passenger gates and more ticketing and baggage-claim areas.
In 1990, the development agency also raised $83 million for the airline to begin improvements at its terminals at La Guardia Airport, as well as at Kennedy. The agency has also financed projects by Japan Air Lines, Nippon Cargo Airways and Air France.

HEADLINE: Decision Is Near on Route 1 Link to Turnpike

BYLINE: By JOSEPH F. SULLIVAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Aug. 19

 BODY:
After 56 years, a highway spur intended to ease congestion along the Route 1 corridor in central New Jersey has finally reached the point at which it will be built or scrapped.
The road, Route 92, was originally conceived as an east-west freeway cutting across some of central New Jersey's busiest north-south routes to link Route 206 near Princeton with Route 33 near Hightstown. 
 In its latest incarnation, which has drawn opposition from a coalition of environmentalists, local officials and area residents, Route 92 would be part of the New Jersey Turnpike and would connect Route 1 in South Brunswick Township with the turnpike at Exit 8A at Monroe Township. It is estimated that the 6.6-mile link would cost more than $200 million.
"Something's got to be done to move traffic out of the Route 1 corridor," said Frank X. McDermott, the chairman of the New Jersey Turnpike Authority. The Legislature, which wanted the road built but could not pay for it, handed the project over to the authority in 1992.
 
'It Makes No Sense'
 But opponents say that the project is too expensive and that the highway would cause environmental and development problems.
"It may have been a good idea about 60 years ago, but today it makes no sense and should not be built," said Michael S. Chunko, chief spokesman for "No 92," a coalition of organizations opposed to the road.
He continued, "This project contradicts public policy, including the state master plan, which says that rural areas are supposed to remain rural. It would force a rezoning of the area to allow more business and would increase air- and water-quality problems."
Opponents also doubt whether the highway would bring benefits equal to its costs. Charles Klatskin, a general partner of the Forsgate Industrial Complex in Monroe Township, near the proposed construction, said the turnpike's studies predicted only a 14 percent decrease in traffic on other east-west roads in the area. "That's a lot of money for that," he said.
Residents of a cluster of communities for people 55 or older near the Forsgate Country Club have signed petitions objecting to the anticipated increase in noise and air pollution from increased truck traffic on the elevated portion of the proposed roadway that will tie into Exit 8A.
Turnpike officials estimate that Route 92 would carry as many as 41,000 vehicles a day by the year 2015, a total roughly equal to the traffic on Route 1 today.
"We have to keep building highways, even though some people think the turnpike wants to pave the state over from the ocean to the Delaware River," Mr. McDermott said. "And an east-west road is still needed from Route 1 to the turnpike."
 
Economic Advantages
 He also argued that there were economic advantages to building the road now. "The turnpike has been the mother of construction in this state and has kept the building trades going for the last several years when they've really been hurting," he said. "One benefit from this is that the cost has been cheaper than ever because of increased competition."
But Joseph G. Peters, spokesman for the Southern South Brunswick Residents Alliance, said the road, as planned, should not be built at any cost: "Originally, it promised a real solution to regional transportation problems, but now it's just a turnpike spur. And it goes through farmlands, woodlands and wetlands, some of the most environmentally sensitive areas of Middlesex County."
Some South Brunswick officials, including Mayor Roger Craig, say they believe it is just too late for the new road, and the township has dropped Route 92 from its master plan. It is asking the state to improve other east-west roads instead.
But master plans are advisory, and South Brunswick's action will not affect the turnpike's decision.
Other nearby towns that would not be directly affected by the construction of Route 92 still support the project, citing benefits of improved traffic flow, as do Mercer and Middlesex County governing bodies.
The final decision on Route 92's fate is likely to rest on money. Although the turnpike can charge tolls to retire its construction bonds, which was the reason the Legislature handed it the project, the authority is already looking at budget problems that may force it to seek a toll increase next year whether it builds Route 92 or not.
Environmental and engineering studies have been completed for the road at a cost of about $1.7 million. Now Mr. McDermott is awaiting the results of a study that will examine construction costs and determine what tolls would have to be charged on the spur to retire the bonds. That study is due in September.
The land acquisition and construction from the turnpike to Route 1 will cost about $200 million. Extending the road a couple of miles farther to Route 27 could add $40 million. These figures do not take into account the cost of offsetting the loss of 27 acres of wetlands to road construction. In similar cases in the past the state has required the authority to build more park-and-ride lots or to create ponds and plant vegetation to attract certain species of wildlife.
Lynn Fleeger, the chief spokeswoman for the turnpike authority, said a final decision on whether to build Route 92 could come next month. "Once the decision is made," she said, "we'll either go ahead with it or put it to bed forever."

HEADLINE: A Slaying Chills Young Japanese in New York

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
His American dreams were at once modest and just beyond reach, centered on racing cars, boxing and the possibility of a green card. Before he was shot to death in a robbery attempt in Queens earlier this month, it seemed like Kei Sunada was inching toward a few of them.
Like many young Japanese who find their way to New York, but unlike most other immigrants his age, Mr. Sunada was lured not by money -- he had plenty of that back home -- but by the chance to pursue an offbeat career. 
 People inside or with close ties to the Japanese community in New York say that Mr. Sunada, 22, was one of the hundreds of young people who flock here from Japan each year, many of them leaving behind wealthy families or good jobs in favor of waiting tables or playing jazz in Washington Square Park.
Many live in the East Village, where they work in Japanese restaurants or bars, or in Astoria, Queens, or northern New Jersey.
 
An Independent Spirit
 Mr. Sunada's friends and family said that he was an independent spirit, haunted perhaps by his parents' divorce and determined to earn his family's respect by defining himself outside of his culture and disconnected from its social conventions.
"Japan is a very rich country," said Takayuki Kanematsu, who knew Mr. Sunada from the Kingsway Boxing Center, on West 40th Street in Manhattan, where both worked out. "But it doesn't have a dream."
Friends and relatives said that Mr. Sunada, who left his home in Fukuoka last year for New York, had been anxious to escape his father, who pressured him to go to college and abandon plans to become a chef and a Formula One race-car driver.
After living with family friends in New Jersey for a few months, Mr. Sunada found a job as an assistant chef in a Manhattan restaurant. He soon found a room to rent in an apartment in Lefrak City, Queens.
It was there that police say he was killed by two robbers who confronted him on Aug. 4 in the stairwell of his building and shot him in the eye. He died three days later. Armond McCloud, 20, and Reginald Cameron, 19, both of Queens, have since been arrested and charged with his murder.
"I told him this was a really tough city," said Nachiko Kudo, one of the family friends who housed him in New Jersey. "I told him he could stay with us, but he wanted to share with Americans.
"He wanted to prove himself to his father," she said. "He wanted to establish himself. He had had a rough time as a child, with the divorce."
Among Japanese as in other immigrant communities, the ties between newcomers and old-timers in the city are strong. Tips about apartments, jobs and where to find Japanese bread or videos are shared through a network of thousands of young people who come to the metropolitan area each year, including 4,160 last year on student visas.
 
Finding Themselves
 "The difference between young Japanese and other immigrants is that their country is close to America economically," said Thomas Gardner, a special assistant at the Japanese Consulate. "They don't come to save themselves as much as to find themselves."
Interviews with dozens of Japanese in New York indicate that many of those in their 20's who leave for the United States do so to escape a a rigid career path requiring them to work doggedly through school and settle into a company job. Many say they long to express a personal style, difficult even in big Japanese cities, where they say there is pressure to dress and behave in a uniform way.
For women, it often means pressure to marry and a lack of career opportunities. For those interested in films or rock music, there are limited outlets, the young people say.
Yuko Koseki, 27, left Kanagawa in 1990 with dreams about film. "I wanted to study film production, but in Japan there are no film schools," she said. She now studies at Hunter College and works at a Japanese-language cable station.
"As a woman, living here is easier for me because in Japan, a woman has social pressure to get married by 25," she added.
Naoto Katafuchi said he would be content with a job in the computer industry, but what he loves about living in the East Village, rather than in Tokyo is that he can grow his hair long and play his guitar.
"If you dress differently there it is hard," he said. "Everything had to be neat and nice. No ripped jeans. Everyone looks the same. I have to use polite words all the time."
Go Restaurant on St. Mark's Place in the East Village is a magnet for young Japanese newcomers who will settle for waiting tables in exchange for the chance to live in New York. Mari Yoshida, 27, a waitress at Go, traded exports at Mitsubishi in Tokyo, but left last summer. "I had a dream from my childhood to come here and study English," she said. "I like New York, but sometimes I am afraid."
 
Told Not to Fight
 The police and Mr. Sunada's friends say that his boxing skills and self-defense instincts may have led him to resist his attackers, who the police say had robbed before but never killed. "We told him not to fight if he was robbed," said Ms. Kudo. "Even though we told him over and over again to be careful, he was a boy and only here for a short while."
Mr. Sunada's killing, which followed fatal shootings of young Japanese victims in Louisiana and California in the last two years, underscored the rising anger in Japan over American gun violence. Last week, about a dozen students who called themselves Japanese Students Against Violence protested in Times Square.
Part of the problem, say many Japanese people, is that newcomers are ill prepared to protect themselves. "A lot of Japanese don't see themselves as unsafe, which is partially why they are," said Mr. Gardner. "They go into Alphabet City late at night and see drug dealers and say, 'This is really interesting, just like the movies,' and that is how they get into trouble."
Most people interviewed, however, said that they did not fear violence, and thought that Mr. Sunada's death was a horrible twist of fate. "When I heard about his death, I thought someone had to stand up," said Masaaki Nishine, 21, who organized the protest. "I wanted to keep his death from being meaningless."

HEADLINE: In a Colombian Port City, the Only Hope Lies in Leaving

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BUENAVENTURA, Colombia

 BODY:
Guillermo B., a tall, thin man in his mid-20's, has tried to leave this poverty-ridden port city five times. With little schooling and a disabled mother to support, his ambition is to go to the United States, find work and return with a fortune.
His first attempt to leave came last year. One night, he bribed a port guard with a counterfeit $100 bill and hid himself in a container that was to go on a cargo ship bound for Florida. As the vessel crossed the Panama Canal, two sailors discovered him and alerted immigration officials in Miami. A month later, the ship returned Guillermo, who asked that his full name not be used, to this Pacific port 200 miles southwest of Bogota. 
 Since then, the police have caught him every time he has tried to smuggle himself out of the country as a stowaway. Yet for him, as for hundreds of other young men here, the cargo ships that enter and depart one of Latin America's busiest Pacific ports are the only means to escape poverty.
Although the bustling port here has thrived under Colombia's economic liberalization and free trade policies, the city's 350,000 mostly black inhabitants have been denied the benefits from the billions of dollars in commerce that pass through each year.
What remains after the ships depart are images of wealth and abundance from abroad. "I wanted to go because people told me that life in the United States was good," said Carlos Murillo, a 34-year-old photographer who tried to leave as a stowaway three times. "I was told that the poor there lived like the rich here."
In the crowded city center, shoeshiners, contraband vendors and cafe owners announce their services to the swarms of seemingly idle people standing about on street corners. Business and industry are nowhere to be found. About 70 percent of the people here are unemployed. The few who find occasional work as port hands earn less than the minimum wage of $110 a month and receive no benefits. Most Buenaventurans share a life of poverty. They also express a common desire: They want to leave.
Guillermo dreams of becoming a "norteno," one of the tiny minority of stowaways who have managed to reach the United States unnoticed and, once there, have struck gold. As illegal aliens with sparse education, many nortenos, or northerners, have found fortune by resorting to drug dealing, and a few make a meager living doing menial work.
With plenty of cash and presents for their families, nortenos return to Buenaventura to lavish their wealth. They drive imported cars, wear gold chains, listen to rap music and pepper their Spanish with American slang. Clad in colorful shirts and imported shoes, they contrast conspicuously with the rest of the population.
As nortenos return to build new homes in the areas where they grew up, they have turned Buenaventura into a city of contrasts. In Bellavista neighborhood, unsturdy wooden shacks that harbor many failed stowaways and threaten to sink when it floods are huddled alongside opulent homes exhibiting flower-laden gardens, spiral staircases and doors that open by remote control.
Yet far from eliciting resentment among the destitute majority here, nortenos serve to strengthen the resolve of those who hope to escape to a brighter future. A local journalist recalled how his best friend had returned a rich man. "I want to be like that," he said. "At the first chance I get, I will leave too."
The areas surrounding the port are filled with throngs of would-be stowaways like Guillermo, waiting for the chance to slip on board a passing ship. For many, it is not the first attempt. A port official here estimated that six or seven people try to leave as stowaways every day.
As more cargo vessels take advantage of the port's recent privatization and added efficiency, the number of stowaways increases. Yet as they begin their journey, the majority face death, apprehension or the prospect of deportation.

It's a common enough promotional device: a special advertising section to tout a state's economy and attract new businesses. But when Fortune magazine recently discussed doing just such a section on New York State, some potential advertisers balked.
Their concern: the 10-page section was scheduled to appear in the Oct. 3 issue -- smack in the middle of a gubernatorial race. 
 The potential advertisers worried that the section -- and therefore their companies -- would appear to be promoting the re-election of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, a Democrat. Because of their misgivings, the section has been postponed until March.
"There was a concern among some companies of this being perceived, even though it's not, as taking a pro-Cuomo position," said Fran Hall, director of special projects for Fortune. "I don't mean to say they are anti-Cuomo; it's just that they don't want to be seen as taking any position."
The section is being promoted by the Business Alliance for a New New York, a joint venture between the state's Department of Economic Development and 11 New York utilities. In July, the alliance sent letters to scores of companies encouraging them to purchase advertising "units" for $19,800. According to the letter, the state planned to distribute 25,000 reprints of the section.
Republicans called the alliance's efforts an attempt to pressure state-regulated companies to underwrite a campaign venture. "If Mario Cuomo wants to develop an ad campaign for his re-election bid, he ought to pay for it himself," said William D. Powers, the Republican state chairman.
State officials said the section was timed to coincide with a national convention of real-estate agents in New York City, not the November election.
"You have to tell your story, and we're not doing it," said Tony Gaetano, a senior deputy commissioner for economic development.
 
Whom Will Giuliani Support? In Primary, None of the Above

New York City's Republican Mayor, Rudolph W. Giuliani, has done his best to keep people wondering about whom he will support in this year's gubernatorial race. And now he has clouded the issue further by saying he will not endorse either candidate -- Richard M. Rosenbaum or George E. Pataki -- in the Sept. 13 Republican primary.
The choice posed something of a dilemma for Mr. Giuliani. On one hand, Mr. Rosenbaum, a former state Republican chairman, has raised money for Mr. Giuliani in past races and is close to several of the Mayor's top advisers.
Yet Mr. Pataki, a State Senator from Putnam County, is a heavy favorite to win the primary. But he is also a protege of Mr. Giuliani's sometime rival, United States Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato.
Mr. Giuliani also faces a conundrum in the general election. He could hurt himself among Republican faithful if he drags his feet in supporting their standard bearer. But he has not ruled out the possibility of endorsing the Democratic incumbent, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, who has bent over backwards at times to help the city and its mayor.
Republican State Committee officials say they think Mr. Giuliani will support the eventual Republican candidate. But Karen Crowe, a spokeswoman for Mr. Giuliani, said he is keeping his options open and plans first to interview all comers.
"He could support any candidate," she said. "It will depend on who can provide the best possible assistance to New York."
 
D'Amato Praises Mitchell, Only to Be Corrected
 Senator D'Amato has never been shy about attacking his opponents, but last week on the Senate floor he lavished praise on one: the majority leader, George J. Mitchell of Maine, whose health care bill Mr. D'Amato dislikes.
Mr. D'Amato rose to say that the process of debating health insurance was too rushed and reminded him of events leading up to the vote he most regretted casting in his 14 years in the Senate: for the 1986 tax act that, among other things, eliminated deductibility for Individual Retirement Accounts.
"I always said to myself, 'Yeah, Senator Mitchell voted the other way, and I applaud him.' He stood up and he voted that way. I wish I had."
Then Mr. Mitchell asked to reply: "I thank the Senator for giving me credit, but I think I better make clear that I voted for it." He added, in a gentle reference to Mr. D'Amato's recent outrage over inconsistent testimony by Treasury Department officials in the Whitewater inquiry: "I thought one thing we better do around here now is correct the record as soon as we can."
Mr. D'Amato, by now chuckling steadily, said: "I was upset with myself for not having gone down there and voted that way."
"I will not tell you why," added the New Yorker, who eviscerated the young Treasury chief of staff, Josh Steiner, for trying to back away from embarrassing diary entries under oath and who seldom misses an opportunity to make a political point. "I try to do it in my diary. I hope the diary does not lie."

HEADLINE: In the Twilight of Deng, China's Rising Stars Jostle

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Aug. 20

 BODY:
With his 90th birthday two days away, his hearing almost gone and his body racked by Parkinson's disease, Deng Xiaoping is still playing an active, though more limited, role as China's paramount leader, United States officials say.
At the same time, they say, President Jiang Zemin has taken important steps to consolidate his power in advance of Mr. Deng's death, as other contenders for China's Communist Party throne maneuver for influence, or even to challenge Mr. Deng's chosen heir. 
 Evidence of Mr. Deng's continuing role, the American officials say, can be seen in his direct contact with Communist Party chieftains on how to handle the delicate transition in North Korea and Beijing's contentious struggle with Washington on human rights and trade.
"On Korea and on how to deal with the United States, Deng has been involved in telling them what strategy to take," an American specialist on Chinese affairs said.
 
Dominant View on Rights
 Beijing's cautious policy of supporting international negotiations to keep nuclear weapons off the Korean peninsula, while refusing to join any openly confrontational pressure campaign against North Korea's leaders, is a hallmark of Mr. Deng's approach, the officials say.
On human rights, they say official thinking is still dominated by Mr. Deng's trenchant view that outside pressure for democratic reform is an attempt to undermine Communist Party rule. That view was prevailing in March when Chinese leaders subjected Secretary of State Warren Christopher to a diplomatic skewering when he arrived to extract concessions on human rights.
On the surface, the notion that Mr. Deng is still pulling the strings might seem to run counter to the assertion by some Western intelligence agencies that his physical and mental faculties have so faded in the last year as to bring on a "pre-transition" in which senior leaders are maneuvering for power upon Mr. Deng's death.
But the two are not necessarily in conflict.
"Deng's role as paramount leader has withered," one China analyst said. "There are fewer and fewer issues that people take to him."
 
A More Creative Approach
 As a result, Mr. Deng's nominal successors are being more creative within the parameters of policy that is collectively known as the Deng line.
"But the line is there until he goes and probably for some time beyond," the analyst said, underscoring that in China, to be paramount leader means that "the daily ability just to breathe in and out still counts heavily."
Five years after the pro-democracy uprising at Tiananmen Square, it is also Mr. Deng's controlling viewpoint that prevents any consideration of reversing the official verdict that the students took part in a "counter-revolutionary rebellion," a verdict that has shattered the lives of thousands of young Chinese and tarred many of them with criminal records.
Although Mr. Deng is frail and virtually invisible, he remains China's most important private citizen. The significance of his participation, and the state of his health, still means everything in a country where no rule of law exists to guide the coming political succession.
Near the end of what is already called the Deng era, simultaneous political repression and phenomenal economic expansion have kept China a study in contradictions, a magnet for moral condemnation as well as for foreign investment. Mr. Deng's passing from the scene will very likely begin an era of uncertainty, perhaps even instability and chaos.
 
The Maneuvering Begins
 And so the maneuvering has begun. Whether they are angling to come out on top, or just to survive, China's younger generation of leaders are engaged in battle with one another in a consensus-driven oligarchy carrying out the Deng line.
While the chief maneuverer seems to be President Jiang, there also appears to be a stirring of political activity from the man he replaced, Yang Shangkun, and from Zhao Ziyang, the disgraced Communist Party chief who took the official blame for the Tiananmen uprising.
Mr. Jiang, the 68-year-old former Mayor of Shanghai, was a dark horse when Mr. Deng selected him in 1989 to become the next paramount leader. Today, he is busy building a network of loyalists in the military and security forces. This spring, President Jiang promoted 19 officers to full general, thus stacking the top ranks of the People's Liberation Army with men who can be expected to show some loyalty in return.
Mr. Jiang last year named one of his old Shanghai cronies to head the People's Armed Police, an 800,000-member force that represents a second military establishment in China. It was built with a $2 billion investment to prevent public assemblies from ever getting out of hand again, as the one did at Tiananmen in 1989.
 
Top Leaders Cooperate
 But an internal United States military analysis of Mr. Jiang's moves concludes that because the influence of the President's military allies "is heavily founded on his relationship to Deng Xiaoping," it "may not outlast his mentor's death." Many analysts, including the late Richard M. Nixon, have argued that Mr. Jiang will be swept aside just as Mao Zedong's designated successor, Hua Guofeng, was swept aside by Mr. Deng in 1978.
For now, Mr. Jiang, Prime Minister Li Peng and Executive Vice Prime Minister Zhu Rongji are showing an extraordinary degree of cooperation as the core of the larger leadership group, Western officials say. It was just a year ago that Mr. Lidisappeared for months after a heart attack in April 1993. His absence raised questions about whether the unpopular and hard-line Prime Minister would be jettisoned for his political liability in issuing the order -- with Mr. Deng's consent -- for the military crackdown in 1989.
But Mr. Li has moved decisively to reclaim his post at the top of the Cabinet and as chairman of the group that runs foreign policy. American officials say he was an influential architect of the security crackdown by China this spring and its tough line toward Washington on human rights.
If Mr. Li leads a grab for power after Mr. Deng's death, he will have to attract powerful backing in the military and among the aged revolutionary heroes that outlive Mr. Deng. Preeminent is Chen Yun, a soft-spoken economist who has grudgingly supported Mr. Deng's economic reforms since 1978. Mr. Chen, who is 89, has seemed more interested in influencing policy than controlling it.
 
Fallen Leader Speaks Out
 That is not the case with Mr. Yang, who still seems seems spry at 87 and who cut a powerful figure during his years as President and second in command of China's military forces. Mr. Yang is decidedly pro-American, while Mr. Chen is decidedly anti-American.
Mr. Yang and his younger half-brother, Yang Baibing, 74, lost their posts at the top of the military in 1992 when Mr. Deng apparently decided that they were building up an independent power base that would threaten Mr. Jiang.
But loss of title has not stopped Mr. Yang from maintaining a public profile as one of China's revolutionary heroes and party stalwarts. The fact that his movements and speeches still command notice in regional newspapers keeps alive the speculation that Mr. Yang, perhaps in alliance with other leaders who are believed to favor reversing the verdict of Tiananmen Square, will make a comeback after Mr. Deng's death.
Such speculation usually groups Mr. Zhao, the disgraced party chief; Wan Li, a former parliamentary chief, and Qiao Shi, a former security chief who now heads the National People's Congress, in an alliance of moderates who would challenge hard-liners for control.
The most important action signaling a recent political move from Mr. Zhao's camp was the leak of his secret speech to the party elders as they were stripping him of power in June 1989.
 
National Strategy Indicted
 Mr. Zhao's words, reported this summer in the Hong Kong press and carried into China, are a powerful indictment of national strategy under Mr. Deng, which emphasizes economic reform and authoritarian political repression. Mr. Zhao's 1989 call to the party was to abandon the notion that China could have an economic revolution without a political revolution.
"I used to think that so long as we did well in reforming the economic structure and developing the economy and people's living standards went up, then the people would be satisfied and society would be stable," Mr. Zhao told party leaders.
"But as I later discovered, this is not the way things are. After living standards and cultural levels have been raised, the people's sense of democracy and sense of political participation will grow stronger. If the building of democracy and a legal system fails to keep up, then society will not be stable."

Benny Ong: A Farewell To All That

BYLINE: By JOHN KIFNER 

 BODY:
BENNY Ong, Uncle Seven, International Adviser for Life of the Hip Sing Tong, the Godfather of Chinatown, lay in state at the Wah Wing Sang Funeral Home the other day, surrounded by enough flowers to cover much of lower Manhattan.
Floral wreaths from businessmen, families and the myriad associations of Chinatown's social network -- family organizations like the important Lee family, the Engs, associations from villages and regions in Canton province, home of the original settlers -- lined the walls and were stacked up on the floor. Funeral banners hung in long narrow strips, proclaiming Mr. Ong's many qualities, notably from officials of the Nationalist government in Taiwan. 
 "High Virtue, Great Expectations" read the characters flanking one side of the entrance, where bulky men in tight black suits greeted mourners for the 87-year old tong leader. The sign on the other side said: "Your success is reflected in the Chinese Community in New York."
Across Mulberry Street, the police, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the F.B.I. and other law-enforcement operatives photographed the mourners from surveillance trucks and observation posts. On a high terrace of the new Federal courthouse a long-lensed camera on a tripod recorded the scene.
For decades, Benny Ong and the Hip Sing -- and the rival On Leong Tong -- dominated the shadowy life of Chinatown, a world almost totally isolated from the larger American society, impenetrable to low faan, the universal term for outsiders, meaning "barbarian."
But Benny Ong's world -- traditional Chinatown, the tight, inward-looking, circumscribed few blocks of homogeneous Cantonese mores, strictly, often harshly, ordered -- is, in many ways, being buried along with him.
It was a world created not just by Chinese culture, but American racism. Poor farmers were recruited from Canton in the mid-19th century for the mines and railroads in the West. But by the 1870's, scapegoated for economic depression, pitted against white workers and union organizers, the Chinese were being lynched and murdered. The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, barring importation of Chinese laborers, shaped the future; Chinese could not become citizens until 1943.
Some fled the violence to Mott and Pell Streets in the 1890's. The Chinese formed an institution called a tong (meeting hall), drawing on the tradition and romance of secret Triad societies of the late 17th century that challenged invading Manchu rulers. It was a self-help organization, like those of other immigrant groups, but it also provided protection against the larger, hostile society, a means of settling disputes, since no law applied.
Tongs, too, ran the high-stakes gambling dens and houses of prostitution that served an almost entirely bachelor society. By loophole and subterfuge, Chinatown grew as men came to climb the Golden Mountain.
Benny Ong arrived in 1922, worked in a laundry at 16 and soon took the ritual oath of the Hip Sing. He was a soldier in the Tong Wars raging into the 1930's, where the weapon of choice led to the term "hatchet man" and the crook in Doyer Street became the "bloody angle." In 1935 he was jailed for 17 years for second-degree murder (he took the fall, it was said, for a higher-up) and in 1974 he became tong boss. He did another year in 1977 when a wire picked him up boasting of payoffs to the law. Oft-cited in government reports on organized crime, he was said to have spent his final years quietly playing mah jongg.
The vast, sometimes contradictory changes sweeping the Chinese community stem from the 1965 Immigration Act opening the door to Asians.
Chinatown has leapt Canal Street, displacing all but a few carefully preserved restaurant blocks of Little Italy -- once a similar closed enclave, where men of mysterious income sipped espresso in unmarked social clubs -- and spread to new Chinatowns in Flushing, Queens, and Sunset Park, Brooklyn. The new families are no longer all Cantonese, and the tongs do not rule the outlying areas.
Chinese crime is not ending. Chinese organizations are supplanting the Mafia in heroin. Gangs extort merchants. Fujianese smuggle immigrants, enforcing the $30,000 debt by kidnapping and torture.
But, change is inevitable. Joss sticks burned in the funeral home and the old gangster's favorite dish, boiled chicken, was there to sustain him on his trip to the afterworld, along with the bribes that would get him past the devils along the way.
He really couldn't speak about Chinatown, Benny Ong's stepson said politely. He himself worked for IBM.

HEADLINE: Discouraging Cubans

 BODY:
Low politics, not high principle, inspired President Clinton's ditching of the double standard that for the last 28 years gave Cuban refugees near automatic entry to the United States. Now, fleeing Cubans risk being stopped at sea by the Coast Guard or Navy and returned to, of all places, the U.S. base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
It is a hasty, harsh and unnecessary move. But at least it brings a semblance of equality to Washington's treatment of those fleeing impoverished Caribbean tyrannies. And it implicitly recognizes that, with the cold war over, Cuba is no longer a special case. The next logical step, which the Administration unfortunately shows no sign of taking, would be to formulate constructive diplomatic policies toward Cuba that could help ease the way to a democratic post-Castro future. 
 The new policy is designed to deter the thousands of Cubans who have been preparing to leave since Fidel Castro's regime stopped interfering with departures earlier this month. Those who elude the Coast Guard and reach U.S. soil will be detained indefinitely upon arrival. Only those who apply and are found eligible for asylum before leaving Cuba will now receive automatic admission.
That is roughly the same policy now applied to Haitians, with one crucial difference. To apply for asylum while still living in Haiti is to court murderous retaliation from government thugs, while discontented Cubans, at least for now, are virtually being encouraged to leave. In both countries, the U.S. is intentionally contributing to popular discontent with tough economic sanctions.
In both cases, generous treatment of the unintended victims of U.S. foreign policy has been defeated by the politics of populist panic. Gov. Lawton Chiles of Florida, facing a tough re-election fight, triggered Mr. Clinton's move by declaring a statewide emergency Thursday. Mr. Clinton, whose own 1980 re-election bid in Arkansas was damaged when Cuban detainees from the last mass exodus rioted at an Arkansas detention camp, readily sympathized with his fellow Democrat's political plight. He also needs Florida's electoral votes for himself in 1996.
The latest departures began after an anti-Castro riot on the Havana waterfront two weeks ago, the most visible political protest in years. The Castro regime may not exactly be in its death throes, but it is reeling from the global collapse of Communism, the loss of Russian trade subsidies and the lack of any obvious successor to Mr. Castro.
That would seem to offer openings for a diplomatic mixture of incentives and threats that have begun to lure Communism's other orphans, like Vietnam and North Korea, out of their isolation. Yet for fear of angering the ferociously anti-Castro lobbies that are so powerful in Florida and New Jersey politics, U.S. policy has been purely punitive, aimed at building up explosive pressures in Cuba. The Administration is trying to sell its refugee ban -- and new package of economic and political pressures -- to Cuban-American hard-liners as part of this same effort.
Interestingly, Bernard Aronson, who served as Assistant Secretary of State for Latin America in the Bush Administration and whose hard-line credentials are not in doubt, presented in The Washington Post last week a more nuanced policy that would offer specific U.S. diplomatic incentives as a reward for steps toward democracy in Cuba. Such a policy is, in fact, suggested by the Cuban Democracy Act of 1992. Unlike the sanctions provisions of that legislation, the suggestions for a possible diplomatic opening have never been followed up.
It is not in the best tradition of the United States to interdict refugees. It is surely not in the best interest of the United States -- or of Cuban democracy -- to encourage violent upheaval in Cuba without also offering some hope of peaceful change.

When I first met him in his Public Theater in 1983, surrounded by trophies and posters commemorating the glory days of the 1960's and 70's, it seemed to me that he combined the looks of a sleek vole with the charisma of the tragic hero so marvelously described by the Renaissance critic Lodovico Castelvetro: he was dynamic and proud, he "intensely wanted what he wanted," he did not endure injury patiently, he was naturally immoderate, he followed his instincts without apology, he was temperamentally more inclined to go to war than to law, and he was most likely capable of "killing both strangers and relatives," in Castelvetro's language. It is no surprise to learn from "Joe Papp: An American Life," Helen Epstein's fascinating biography, that early on he concluded that any theater needed "a strong monarch," and that in his later years some of his associates thought of him as an erratic, arbitrary but still formidable King Lear.
But you could hardly say, with Goneril, that the best of his time was but rash. Has there been a more energetic, effective figure in the modern American theater? It was not merely the well-known accomplishments: the Homeric battle to provide free Shakespeare to New Yorkers and build the Delacorte Theater in Central Park; the conversion of the Astor Library into that vast creative caldron, the Public Theater; the discovery of David Rabe and many another striking playwright, and of Meryl Streep and scores of other fine actors; the pioneering dedication to colorblind casting and minority-group theater; and much more. It was also that fierce missionary zeal, the example it gave and the idealism it kept alive. If it is still possible in America to think of theater in its original Greek way -- a vital experience that the polis should be offering as a right to all its citizens, not just to the educated or moneyed few -- Joe Papp is more to be thanked than anybody else.
As Ms. Epstein evokes it, Papp's Brooklyn childhood explains why he became the sort of producer he did, yet makes it hard to understand why he became a producer at all. His father was a trunk maker who spent long periods unemployed, and his mother did not learn to read or write English until she was in her 60's. Though he played Scrooge in a school "Christmas Carol" at age 8, his family was far too poor to afford trips to any theaters, let alone those on Broadway. He ran wild, plucked chickens and shined shoes for pocket money, and did not continue his education after high school. Somehow he managed to land a respectable job with a company of jewelry manufacturers, and would probably have made a career in that trade, had he not been fired for organizing a strike and telling his boss off in very colorful language.
AS that suggests, he was radicalized as well as toughened by late Depression Brooklyn. He became a Communist and remained one deep into the 1950's. Ms. Epstein also tells us that he never forgot the beating he received at age 14 from an anti-Semitic 17-year-old called Whitey. What he learned from this thug -- "if you want to make an impact, you hit first, hard and without any kind of feeling" -- he would one day teach others. In 1958, CBS thought it could quietly fire Papp from his then job as a stage manager after he pleaded the Fifth Amendment at a House Committee on Un-American Activities hearing, and it was wrong. In 1959, the Parks Commissioner, Robert Moses, the political powerhouse who commanded the very shape and appearance of New York City, believed he could stop the presentation of free Shakespeare in Central Park, and he was wronger still. To take on Papp was often to end up on your back in the ring, stunned by the man's chutzpah, resourcefulness and aggression.
Two things turned Joseph Papirofsky, as he was called until his mid-30's, into Joe Papp. One was a love of literature, and especially of Shakespeare, great slabs of which he could quote from high school onward. The other was the wartime Navy, where for no very good or clear reason he found himself entrusted with organizing variety shows for bored sailors. At all events, the later 1940's saw him first at the Actors' Laboratory in California, next presenting Shakespeare to tiny audiences in a church hall in New York City. And bit by bit the cultural islet expanded into an empire that at one time stretched beyond Broadway, where "A Chorus Line" and "For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide/When the Rainbow Is Enuf" and many other plays that Papp had originally opened downtown were regularly to be found, to Lincoln Center, which he tried and failed to transform into an offbeat American National Theater.
Ms. Epstein, a freelance journalist, relates Papp's professional achievements interestingly and lucidly, though there are odd gaps. Why, for instance, did Sam Shepard storm out of the Public after the production of his "True West" and why did he never return? That not-insignificant contretemps is barely mentioned, let alone explained. But if there is an overall criticism to be made of the book, it is about its handling of Papp's private life. I sometimes felt Ms. Epstein could have dug deeper, asked harder questions, and maybe speculated more about the workings of that odd, elusive psyche. There were even moments when I wondered if she wasn't the victim of her friendship with Papp and his family. The book was, after all, once conceived as a quasi-official biography, written in cooperation with the producer.
Not that Ms. Epstein is obviously evasive or willfully busy with the airbrush. She tells us that Papp himself felt he had "not been praiseworthy in my private life," and up to a point she explains why. He was married four times and had five children. But he did not even know of the existence of his eldest daughter for many years; he was denied access for a time to a son; and he was, on the whole, a neglectful father to his other children. His middle two marriages can hardly have been helped by the fact that like many Jewish people in the 40's, he was "passing" as a gentile. He told one wife that his father was Russian and his mother a Briton who "had tea every afternoon at 4 with a silver service," and another that he was Anglo-Polish and "the youngest graduate ever of Columbia University." It is scarcely surprising that his divorces were marked by what Ms. Epstein calls "great bitterness," but she tells us little or nothing of the form this bitterness took.
IS it just prurient curiosity to want amplification? Or do we all have a legitimate interest in a man -- in my view a great man -- whose professional achievements were clearly actuated by inner needs and drives of immense complexity and intensity? Think of that proto-Papp, Napoleon, and the answer is obvious. Again, Ms. Epstein tells us a certain amount about the turbulence behind the tough-guy exterior. There were nightmares, anxiety attacks, bouts of depression and psychosomatic seizures that do not appear to have halted until after he began to see a therapist, on whom he became strongly dependent. According to his third wife, Peggy, this made him less emotionally cut off, yet had an effect that was, she told Ms. Epstein, "catastrophic." But precisely what she meant by that is unclear.
With time, Papp's private life became more settled. He embraced his Jewishness with pride. His marriage to Gail Merrifield in 1976 became lasting and seems to have been happy. He became closer to his children, notably his son Tony, who died of AIDS when he was 28, shortly before Papp himself succumbed to cancer in 1991 at the age of 70. There is a touching passage describing his first, tearful meeting with his "lost" daughter, Barbara, when she was 35. But paternal devotion still had its limits. Ms. Epstein needs to provide more -- and more direct -- testimony from his surviving children. But she is convincing when she argues that the brood receiving most of Papp's care and attention were his playwrights. Again and again their voices are to be heard in her book, voicing filial love and gratitude, Oedipal anger, or both at once. "I thought that we playwrights represented the kind of children Joe would have liked to have had," Thomas Babe is quoted as saying, "gifted, screwed up in some way, and largely dependent -- boys who could . . . absorb the blows and remain loyal, whatever happened."
The final portrait that emerges might have been jointly painted by Goya, Whistler and Francis Bacon, so hard is it to categorize. Papp was charming, funny, intelligent, interesting, warm, loyal and utterly likable. He was arrogant, myopic, hostile, cruel, cold, treacherous and utterly unlikable. For better or worse, or both, he broke the rules. You don't abruptly fire long-term colleagues like his associate producer, Bernard Gersten, for little or no reason. You don't persistently run up huge debts and insist on others paying them. You don't harass and harangue politicians, or bully and snub potential donors. You don't refuse money because you dislike the source. You don't ring up critics, as Papp did with Clive Barnes at The New York Times, and let rip a tirade of obscene invective. Yet maybe American culture needs a few more people who combine that commitment with those street-fighting skills.
Certainly it is difficult to be patient with the mandarin detractors Ms. Epstein quotes. Papp was a cultural opportunist with no distinct esthetic? But his view was always that theater should be questing, diverse, catholic, appealing to more than one set of tastes; it should embody "Hair" and a pop "Pirates of Penzance" as well as the plays of John Guare and David Hare. He was publicity mad? Maybe, but he insured that his theaters were always at the center of public attention. He was absurdly profligate with ideas, the airier the better? Yet it was not just rhetoric when he said, as he often did, "Don't tell me anything is impossible, let's try it first." He was the irresistible force that changed that immovable object, the American theater.
 
 
 
'A CHORUS LINE' IS BORN
 Michael Bennett . . . had long wished to create his own musical about dancers and, in January of 1974, had taken a first step. He had invited 21 dancers to a midnight gathering. . . . They sat in a circle and Bennett asked them to give their name, date and place of birth, talk about their childhood and describe how they first became interested in dancing. They talked for five hours, took a break and then talked until noon the next day. Bennett played some of those tapes for Papp. . . .
The two men hit it off. . . . Bennett had done 16 Broadway shows under the standard Broadway scenario, which began with five weeks of tightly scheduled rehearsal, a few weeks of out-of-town tryouts and then a New York opening. Workshop conditions at the Public, during which he could develop his idea with a cast of dancers, gave him respite from time and money pressures. . . . In August, Papp was invited to sit in at final callbacks for dancers, who auditioned . . . by reading the transcripts of the tapes some of them had made half a year earlier.
Those who were chosen for Bennett's first workshop began the process of creating "A Chorus Line" -- five weeks of working 14 hours per day in the Newman Theater for $100 per week. . . . Many of the dancers found . . . the ongoing interviewing process, by which both the play and the songwriting continued, intrusive and left. . . . In December . . . Michael Bennett reassembled his dancers and collaborators for their second workshop. With James Kirkwood, a novelist and playwright, the team . . . plunged into another three months of work, bringing Papp's investment and his anxiety about its development to a high. . . . On May 21, the day of the press opening, Papp sent Bennett his standard letter to playwrights, inviting him to come back and fail at the Public but by then, almost everyone at the Festival knew that they had something extraordinary in the building. . . . "Anyone who saw the show would just sit there and weep," recalled a staffer. "There were standing ovations from the beginning." . . . In July . . . Papp moved it to Broadway where it would win the Festival its third Pulitzer Prize and break all records.
"A Chorus Line" would also, as Papp had foreseen, break many connections as well. Bennett became a millionaire. The show's several collaborators quarreled and several dancers felt cheated. But Bennett and Papp maintained the cordial relation they had pledged to uphold. Their association was one that Papp would later recall as simple, constant and untroubled. It stood him in good stead as, at 54, he plunged into what would be the most glamorous as well as frustrating period of the New York Shakespeare Festival.

BIOGRAPHERS AREN'T BURGLARS
 Helen Epstein is on a high. She's just back from a two-week publicity tour in Prague where her first book, "Children of the Holocaust," has finally been published in Czech -- 15 years after its appearance in English. "This was very important to me," the author, who was born in Prague, explained. The book, which broke new ground in 1979, has been published in several languages, but "none as significant as this one," Ms. Epstein said.
In a telephone interview from her vacation home in the Berkshires, the author, now 46, spoke about her new book, "Joe Papp: An American Life," and about her collaboration with Gail Merrifield Papp, his widow, who asked her to write this biography shortly after his death. Ms. Epstein has written that Papp's widow "respected the integrity of the writing process. . . . She never imposed her convictions on me."
But "almost everyone," she continued, "expressed fear of a whitewash. People believe that if you are given access to private papers, you essentially have to trade your independence for that access. I think that kind of investigative journalism mentality is driving attitudes toward authorized biographies, which is basically that they're suspect. Many, many professional and personal friends actually came right out and said, 'How are you going to do this?' They didn't believe I could pull it off. But biographers who do it know that if you respect the process, the process takes care of itself."
Nevertheless, she said, "It was very, very difficult. I got really angry at some of the recent accusations about biographers being burglars and immoral people. All the biographers I know are incredibly respectful of people's privacy.
"This biography involved extraordinary tightrope walking between private and public, between what to divulge and what not to divulge. It wasn't only Gail. There were five Papp children involved here and two ex-wives about whom I was extremely sensitive because they're lovely people.
"There was an enormous number of people whose feelings, whose sexuality, whose alcoholism, had to be hidden or respected. Some people wanted to be identified as homosexuals; some didn't. The hardest thing about writing this book was dealing with everybody's psychological problems."
The author characterized her relationship with Joseph Papp as that of a portrait painter to her canvas. "It was hard to react to the whole person because there are so many different parts of him and I feel so differently toward each one of them. Some I admired and some I didn't."
"As for the collaboration," she said, "it was harder on me than my marriage. My husband is in business and I don't see him all day."

 CORRECTION:
A review on Aug. 21, about "Joe Papp: An American Life," described a daughter of Joseph Papp, the theatrical producer, incorrectly. Mr. Papp's daughter Barbara, whose existence he was unaware of for many years, was his second daughter, not his first. A letter explaining the mistake was received by the Book Review soon afterward, but it was misdirected.

HEADLINE: The Case of the Murdered Candidate

BYLINE: By Tim Golden; Tim Golden is the Mexico City bureau chief of The New York Times.

 BODY:
IN THE VIDEOTAPES OF LUIS DONALDO COLOSIO'S last campaign speech, the working-class neighborhood spreading before him in Tijuana looks like any other colonia of half-paved streets and yards fenced in by bedsprings. Women in nylon dresses press against a line of men guarding the candidate's path. College students hold up a banner proclaiming "Enough!" of the 65-year rule of Colosio's Institutional Revolutionary Party, the PRI. But on the plywood shacks and cinder-block cubes that fill the steep canyon called Lomas Taurinas, there are many more banners: "Colosio," they read, "Colosio, We're Going for More" and "Colosio, I Love You."
As cameras follow him out of a brown Chevrolet Suburban just before 4:30 P.M. on March 23, Colosio radiates a confidence that had been missing from his campaign. The seemingly calm, upbeat country that President Carlos Salinas de Gortari had bequeathed to him with the governing-party nomination in November had disappeared with the New Year. The peasant rebellion that erupted in the southern state of Chiapas took the Government by surprise. Bombings in Mexico City, the kidnappings of two powerful businessmen, new pressure for political change and an angry backlash from hard-liners within his party -- all of that had battered a candidate who stood for the status quo. 
 Finally, though, Colosio was regaining momentum. Lashing out at the system through which he had risen, he vowed on March 6 to tear the roots of authoritarianism from Mexican soil. The day before his arrival in Tijuana, his chief rival within the party, Manuel Camacho Solis, finally abandoned his threat to seek the presidency himself. In March, the polls still showed Colosio comfortably ahead. On the videotape, as he clambers onto the bed of a pickup truck to speak, the crowd in Lomas Taurinas smiles back at him enthusiastically, quite sure that he will be their next President.
"Friends of Tijuana, friends of the working-class colonias, this political campaign should allow us on the 21st of August to give Baja California and our country a secure destiny, a path of certainty," he tells them. "We are going to win!"
As the candidate hops down from the pickup and pushes back through the crowd, the smile never leaves his face. A jumpy ranchera song blares over the public address system, and he reaches over the shoulders of his bodyguards to shake hands. A gun reaches over them, too, sliding up out of the crowd and settling just behind Colosio's right ear.
What the tapes don't show is whose hand pulls the trigger on the battered .38-caliber revolver that was later picked out of the dirt at the scene. In half a second, the gun simply appears, fires and shatters the certainty with which Mexico had so long been governed.
Who killed Colosio? Like the Zapruder film of the Kennedy assassination, the videotapes of Colosio's death are vague enough to allow all sorts of interpretations. A 23-year-old factory worker named Mario Aburto Martinez was tackled at the scene and reportedly confessed to committing the crime while acting alone. But that convinced almost no one. In the frenzied search for conspiracies, some Mexicans pointed to Tijuana's most powerful cocaine traffickers, who had been sought for 10 months in the still-unsolved murder of a Roman Catholic cardinal, and to "narcopoliticos," the corrupt politicians believed to protect them. Others suspected hard-line members of the PRI, renegade members of the security forces, even Salinas himself. It was only a measure of the cold war's distance that the Central Intelligence Agency went unmentioned.
Even as Mexicans go to the polls for today's elections, with Colosio's former campaign manager, Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon at the head of the PRI ticket, they are still waiting to find out who, if anyone, moved Mario Aburto's hand. Although President Salinas swore at Colosio's graveside that "justice will be totally done," the Government's subsequent performance raised doubts among cynical Mexicans. Only days after Government officials described the killer as a lonely fanatic, the special prosecutor assigned to the case, Miguel Montes Garcia, shocked the country by announcing that "several individuals" had helped Aburto close in on Colosio in the crowd. Three months later, Montes reversed himself, returning to the lone-gunman theory and raising a storm of criticism that was quieted only after Salinas reopened the case with a new investigator.
What Montes did not do was to confront openly the suspects on whom most Mexicans -- particularly those within the Government -- focused right away: the corrupt, conservative factions of the PRI that have resented Salinas's drive for economic modernization. The suspicions were perhaps inevitable in a society where killings of political dissidents have often gone unsolved and where promises of democracy and a more equitable distribution of wealth have long gone unfulfilled. No hard evidence of such a plot has emerged. No specific motives have been discerned. But by what it left out as much as what it turned up, the Government's faltering inquiry has cast a shadow over the PRI and its future. If the Government cannot convincingly explain the killing of its own presidential candidate, Mexicans have asked, how can it promise justice for people with no power? And without at least a vaguely credible legal system, how far can the country's push for economic and political reform progress? The case of the murdered candidate involves more than a crime. The killing has exposed fault lines in a society that, notwithstanding its rising stock market and confident young technocrats, remains divided and uncertain.
FOR DAYS AFTER COLOSIO'S death, Ernesto Ruffo kept asking, perhaps disingenuously, "Why Tijuana?" As Mexico's first opposition-party governor since the PRI was formed in 1929, Ruffo had grown uncomfortably familiar with hidden agendas. He had fought with Mexico City over Federal money that his state, Baja California, did not receive and over the huge sums that Salinas poured directly into Federal antipoverty programs. He had found political meddling in the fight against drugs, and drug interests mixed in the fights of local politicians. But there is no shortage of answers to his question.
The city itself, a pastiche of glitzy nightclubs and cheap brothels, glass office towers and endless slums terraced with old tires, dramatizes the tensions of a country teased by the riches of its northern neighbor and anchored painfully to a bitter, underdeveloped south. Some of the locals who had spoken from the pickup truck before Colosio made the point plainly: they were striving, unsatisfied people who had mostly come from other parts of the country, wanted better than they got and would work to get more. They lived on the border, one of them noted, but were proud enough not to cross it.
There was no mention in the speeches of another, violent side of Tijuana, but that was one Colosio might have taken for granted. Three weeks before his arrival, a highly regarded young Federal police commander and four other people had been killed in a shootout near a Tijuana shopping mall. Their opponents were gangsters tied to the Arellano brothers, the homegrown brood of violent, cocaine-trafficking yuppies who were being hunted for the killing of Juan Jesus Cardinal Posadas Ocampo at the Guadalajara airport in May 1993. No sooner had the two most important traffickers of the lot been captured than they were allowed to sneak out the back door of the state police headquarters by a cooperative commander.
Neither Colosio nor Salinas was especially popular with their party's traditionalists in Tijuana. Baja had delivered Salinas one of the worst defeats of any Mexican state in his July 1988 election. The new President had quickly exacted revenge, throwing out the legendarily corrupt governor, Xicotencatl Leyva. When Ruffo defeated the PRI in the ensuing gubernatorial election, Colosio, then the president of the party, earned the hatred of its local leaders by quickly recognizing the opposition's victory. It was the first time in its 60-year history that the governing party had accepted such a loss.
Salinas and Colosio "had to show right at the door of the United States that there was going to be democracy in this country," says Jesus Blancornelas, the editor of Tijuana's independent weekly newspaper, Zeta. "But the party did not like it at all."
Cries of "Colosio Traitor!" and "Death to Colosio!" went up among some of the labor-union leaders and other party bosses. But for the president of the PRI and his direct superior, Salinas, Baja California became an experiment in how to remake a broken political party. Lomas Taurinas, the province of a wiry political boss named Agustin Perez Rivero, became one of their laboratories.
Under a scheme that the party began to perfect in the 1970's, the PRI turned to men like Don Agustin, as he likes to be called, to gain control over the vast squatter settlements that had sprung up on publicly owned land. With the blessing of local officials, Don Agustin would sell small plots for $500 or $1,000, from which party and Government officials would take a cut. Little if any paper changed hands. In return for Government tolerance and the occasional attentions of public works officials, Don Agustin would do his best to assure that his colonia voted solidly for the PRI.
"Every time Don Agustin woke up, he needed some new sandals," says Sofia Colin, a 28-year-old housewife who moved to the neighborhood upon arriving from Mexico City in 1985. "If he took a breath, he needed a new shirt. His secretaries would leave a white envelope and you had to put in what you could. When politicians would come from Mexico City, he made everyone dress up in green shirts and white pants; they called it the 'Coalition of People's Colonias.' And anyone who did not go to one of those meetings, they would take away their land."
Part of Salinas's strategy for breaking these strangleholds was his lavish antipoverty initiative, the National Solidarity Program. Under the program, neighbors would form small committees to decide whether they most needed a sewer, a school or something else. They would then contribute labor or money to the job, which would be supervised and mostly financed by the Government. The program circumvented inefficient and corrupt Federal and local agencies, and often gave squatters title to their land. The principal result was to steadily build the popularity of a president whose election had been marred by accusations of fraud and to cut people like Don Agustin out of the loop.
"They came in and started telling us that what we didn't do for ourselves nobody was going to do for us," Colin recalls, describing her first attendance at one of the seminars that the local Solidarity office organized for some of the feistier women in Lomas Taurinas. "They said we didn't need our little leaders for anything. So we started asking them where all the money we gave them was going."
As president of the PRI until early 1992, Colosio tried to generate similar struggles around the country. He largely failed in his quest to turn the rusted machine of interest groups cutting secret deals into a real party of voters. But thereafter, dispensing the Solidarity program's riches as the new Secretary of Social Development, he began to inherit the support that Salinas had built. Colosio was confident enough of his independence from the party machine that, soon after his nomination, the PRI logo began to disappear from his campaign.
EVEN TENS OF THOUSANDS OF solidarity committees, however, do not make a revolution. How little things had actually changed in Tijuana became apparent as soon as the assassination investigation began. An hour before midnight on March 23, Diego Valades, the bookish constitutional lawyer who in January had become Salinas's fourth attorney general, stopped to see Ruffo in his Tijuana office. With him went Manlio Fabio Beltrones, the tough, 41-year-old governor of the neighboring Sonora state. Beltrones had risen through the political elite as an aide to Salinas's former interior minister, Fernando Gutierrez Barrios, a veteran of 30 years in the upper reaches of the country's secret police.
Valades had been seething about Baja California for three weeks, since state police released the drug traffickers who had been arrested in the slaying of the Federal police commander. Even as Colosio lay dying in the Tijuana General Hospital, people had spoken to Valades about the possible involvement of members or former members of the same force.
"This is your police that are involved again," Ruffo recalls Valades telling him. "Your police are scum!" Ruffo objected that there was no such information.
By the next day, he says, Valades had changed his tone. He even greeted the deputy state prosecutor, whom he would later have arrested at gunpoint for setting the drug traffickers free. For reasons that never became entirely clear, Salinas pulled Valades off the investigation within days and forced him to resign six weeks after that. The attorney general's suspicions about the involvement of corrupt cops in the assassination would later be borne out. But the corrupt cops would not be Ruffo's.
The strange things that began happening immediately after the assassination seemed to concentrate around the one Tijuana cop with a notable reputation for honesty. Jose Federico Benitez, a former businessman with the air of a boy scout troop leader, had cleaned out nearly a third of of the city police force during 16 months as its chief. Though he had no jurisdiction over the Colosio case, he was approached the day after the murder by a man who said he had been given a valise for safekeeping by Aburto's mother. The man said he went to the city police because no one paid attention to him at the Federal attorney general's office. The story never quite made sense to Benitez, but when he opened the valise he found a trove of Aburto's belongings, including a collection of strange, amateurish drawings, a small address book and a ledger full of rambling, misspelled diatribes against the Government. The items were quickly handed over to Federal agents, and within 48 hours the contents began to leak out selectively, supporting a presumption that Aburto was deranged.
"He does not seem to be crazy, but like a zealot," one of the officials calling around to reporters said. "It seems now like he acted alone. There are drawings."
Aburto's own statements seemed to contradict this idea. He told his interrogators that he belonged to some sort of political group and that he had "saved Mexico." What he might have meant by this provoked frantic speculation about possible conspiracies. Photos of the crowd at Colosio's rally began to appear in newspapers and magazines with little circles around the heads of suspects later questioned by Federal investigators. Politicians and Government officials who participated in the fight over Colosio's replacement, found themselves mentioned in newspaper stories about the investigation.
On April 4, the special prosecutor, Montes, went on national television to announce that he had four new suspects in custody and was hunting for two more.
"Several individuals agreed that they undertook a concerted action with the common goal of taking the life of Luis Donaldo Colosio," he said, presenting portions of a videotape that showed a tight crowd of men jostling one another in Colosio's path. A retired state police official named Vicente Mayoral Valenzuela "opened the way to the victim" for Aburto, Montes said. Mayoral's unemployed son, Rodolfo, set out "to push and block" one of Colosio's bodyguards. Tranquilino Sanchez Venegas, a 57-year-old former store security guard shown on the videotape with a happy grin, "facilitated" Aburto's approach to the candidate, Montes said.
All three of the suspects were members of the crowd control team assembled by the Tijuana branch of the PRI. They had been recruited by a local PRI official and former state police commander named Jose Rodolfo Rivapalacio, who was also taken into custody. All Montes left out was a motive. But Rivapalacio, in particular, gave conspiracy theorists ample material to work with, even after he was released by a Federal judge for lack of evidence. He declined to be interviewed in his home, which looked rather luxurious for that of a retired cop with a sixth-grade education. In the office of his lawyer, however, Rivapalacio could hardly stop talking.
Yes, it was true that he used to bring home shopping bags with $10,000 or $20,000; the money came from rewards he received from American insurance companies for recovering stolen cars taken across the border. Yes, it was true that he had investigated political dissidents and arrested all of Ruffo's bodyguards when he was running for governor in 1988. Sure, he would be happy to talk to the San Diego detectives who had been trying to speak to him for seven years about an unsolved attack on his ex-wife, who was stabbed 17 times with an ice pick. No, he would not cross the border to do so: he owed some back taxes on a factory he once owned.
"They got Al Capone for not paying his taxes," Rivapalacio observed.
JESUS BLANCORNELAS, THE newspaper editor, is Tijuana's resident expert on murder conspiracy investigations. He watched the videotapes of the Colosio killing, checked into the backgrounds of the suspects and pronounced himself unimpressed. Even by local standards, the jailed cops didn't seem either nasty or smart enough to take on such a big job. And what could Aburto possibly consider sufficient compensation for taking the fall?
"Every reporter who comes to town brings his own theory about a plot, which he insists on proving even when there is no proof," said Blancornelas, a slight man with a well-trimmed, graying beard and wire-rimmed glasses. "I think it has become a matter of shame, that they cannot accept that one man overcame the entire national security apparatus of the country."
As the weeks passed, Montes said almost nothing publicly about the case, leaving speculation to run wild. But as court files began to leak out, his case began to look far less certain. The most his lip readers could produce from the videotapes was a claim that Rodolfo Mayoral had appeared to say something in Aburto's vicinity that sounded like "Wait." He also uttered a word with the letter A. As in, "Avientalo!" they suggested, "Blow him away!"
According to an official who saw the case summary prepared for Montes by Federal investigators, it had not even mentioned a mysterious security agent, Jorge Antonio Sanchez Ortega, who was arrested near the murder scene by Tijuana police and then mysteriously freed despite having tested positive for having fired a gun. When Montes finally tracked down the two suspects he had mentioned earlier but had not been able to identify, he decided against arresting them. Again, he declined to explain.
More questions were asked by the Tijuana police chief, Benitez, in the weeks following the assassination. On orders from Ruffo, he had dug up police files on members of Rivapalacio's crowd control force. It called itself the Tucan Group, after a Spanish acronym for Ruffo's and Benitez's political party: "Everyone United Against National Action." Benitez would wonder aloud about the case to anyone who dropped by his tiny downtown office. What about the different trajectories of the bullets that hit Colosio? Might they have come from different guns? And the strange valise Benitez had received? Why had Colosio's military bodyguards told some of his officers they would be going to look for the murder weapon at the scene -- even though they knew that the Taurus revolver Aburto said was his had already been recovered?
On April 28, Benitez was murdered. He was being driven home from work when his pickup truck was pinned by two cars not far from Lomas Taurinas. He and his driver were both shot dead. State officials suggested that the killing might have been ordered by local drug traffickers. But as the weeks passed they produced no evidence to sustain their explanation.
In his four months as special prosecutor, Montes visited Tijuana only once, briefly. From conversations with Aburto's neighbors, co-workers and relatives, it wasn't clear that his dozens of carefully selected investigators had been energetic, either. A neighbor who told of Aburto discussing guns over the man's cellular telephone said he was never questioned. A young woman who had worked with Aburto at a dingy cassette-tape assembly plant near the United States border said he had told her shortly before the assassination that he was about to receive a lot of money for something he would do, that politics was involved and that he might end up on television. Her testimony was taken and appears to have been discounted.
Montes paid much more attention to another girl Aburto had worked with, Graciela Gonzalez, the 16-year-old daughter of a retired army captain. In a series of statements to investigators while she was closeted in a Tijuana hotel, Gonzalez described in almost photographic detail how she and Aburto encountered Tranquilino Sanchez, one of the four men jailed after the killing, as they strolled through a Tijuana park. She also claimed that Aburto had told her of going to Chiapas around the time of the peasant revolt and of belonging to some sort of political group.
Months later, however, it turned out that she had picked Sanchez from a police lineup filled with the detectives who had been interrogating her. It hadn't been Sanchez she had seen, she later testified, but Vicente Mayoral. Subsequently, she disavowed her most important testimony almost entirely. "The court lawyer wrote it," one of the investigators admitted later about Gonzalez's testimony. "It is what is called a 'maquinazo,' an invention of the typewriter." And yes, the investigator acknowledged, Tranquilino Sanchez had given some ofhis testimony from a wheelchair, having apparently been beaten by police interrogators.
Montes complained privately to at least two officials that some unofficial investigators were getting in his way, interviewing potential witnesses before his men arrived and perhaps affecting their testimony. The investigators appeared to have been dispatched, Montes said, by a man named Miguel Nazar Haro, a former head of the Federal Security Directorate, a shadowy and notoriously corrupt branch of the Interior Ministry. Nazar, who jumped $200,000 bail in San Diego (he was charged in 1982 with participating in a huge stolen-car ring run out of the directorate), had apparently been advising Governor Beltrones of Sonora on security matters. The Governor did not answer requests for comment on his role in the Colosio case.
Court documents show that there were in fact three security contingents present at the assassination site: Rivapalacio's, Colosio's and an additional force called the Omega Group. The group, which numbered about 160 men around the country, was headed by a man named Fernando de la Sota. According to several officials, de la Sota had been an agent in the Federal Security Directorate, which was eventually disbanded, and later was dismissed from the Federal Judicial Police. He was never implicated in Colosio's death, and nothing more was disclosed about the Omega Group.
MONTES'S CASE FOR A conspiracy had been built largely on three pillars: the videotapes, Graciela Gonzalez's testimony about Sanchez's friendship with Aburto and Sanchez's admission to that effect. But by now the videotapes had been discredited by the Spanish experts, Gonzalez had retracted most of her "testimony," and Sanchez was still wearing a neck brace. Montes began to back away from what he had always insisted was merely a theory about "concerted action."
"It is possible that somebody with enough ability, seeing Mario Aburto's personality, could have stimulated him somehow, directly or indirectly," Montes said in an interview. "That's possible. It's very possible that he went to different kinds of political meetings. But this office is only working on a criminal investigation, not a political and social investigation.
"I never used the word 'plot.' " he adds. "I never used the word 'conspiracy.' And I get a little desperate when people keep saying, 'The truth cannot be known.' The truth they have thought up in advance is some ghost of their own making. Whenever there are magnicides, there is some important number of people who cast doubt on the results of any investigation. That happens in every latitude. How many people in your country believe the Warren Commission report?"
Meanwhile, Colosio's widow, Diana Laura Riojas, suggested pointedly that she was still waiting to learn who had killed her husband. After hiring one of the country's leading criminal lawyers, she left Mexico for a long vacation in Europe. When Montes announced his return to the lone-gunman theory, the lawyer promptly dismissed it as "ridiculous, period." A long list of Colosio's friends published a letter in Mexico City newspapers asking for something more credible. Some of them told friends that they then received death threats over the phone.
Nearly lost in all of the uproar over Montes's conclusions about the lone-assassin theory was the known assassin. Along with psychiatric studies showing him to be paranoid and narcissistic, Montes produced some old criminal records about Aburto's father having once been sought for murder in an old shootout. The Government distributed copies of Aburto's ledger, authenticated by handwriting experts, which showed at the very least that he didn't like the PRI. According to Montes, Aburto had asked his jailers for "Don Quixote."
HOW FAR COLOSIO might have carried Mexico's political reform can only be guessed. He was neither the brightest nor the most forceful of Salinas's heirs. But to many Mexicans he came to represent the possibility that the next government could balance the country's rising demands for change against the resistance of the old guard.
Although Colosio had not yet confronted the party's "dinosaurs," his closest aides say that curtailing their power was his central goal. Before gaining his nomination by the traditional, entirely undemocratic means, he had seemed to believe with Salinas that Mexico could make the inevitable transition to democracy without putting the power of the governing party at risk. That is, the PRI should face open competition but only as the economy produced wider benefits and the party was restructured to make it more representative. With his death, the country he had begun to to describe as "hungering and thirsting for justice," seemed to grow less patient.
No matter how badly the Government may have botched the investigation, a plurality of Mexicans may well vote for the PRI anyway, whether out of cynicism, dissatisfaction with the alternatives or fear of change. But whoever wins is unlikely to gain a majority of the vote. A consequence, at least starting out, could be the weakest Mexican President in memory. Even if the victor is Zedillo, the Colosio investigation will leave a cloud over the new Government. Dispersing it could require steps as difficult as holding fair elections, rooting out corruption and building a credible legal system.

HEADLINE: CHOICE TABLES;
San Francisco's Chefs Explore Beyond the Bay

BYLINE: By BRYAN MILLER; BRYAN MILLER is a reporter for the style department of The Times.

 BODY:
TRAVELERS to San Francisco this summer in search of what is new and hot on the restaurant front may have to cross a bridge or two to find out. So far this year, a half dozen or more leading chefs have opened second or third restaurants in the surrounding countryside, from Marin, Napa and Sonoma Counties in the north to Palo Alto in the south.
This gastronomic greening trend has several causes. For one, San Francisco, which is finally emerging from a long recession exacerbated by the 1989 earthquake, is saturated with restaurants. At the same time, many affluent suburbs suffer from a dearth of fine dining. Add to this the allure of the tourist-rich wine country, and it's no wonder chefs are expanding out of town. 
 Several of the new out-of-town restaurants I visited recently were clearly works in progress, with rough edges here and there. Nevertheless, all of these establishments can be recommended, even as they hone their acts. Wine aficionados will find an intriguing selection of small, lesser known labels that are fun to sample, and most are offered at fair prices.
 
The Left Bank
One of the first major chefs to carry his pans across the Golden Gate was Bradley Ogden, the chef at San Francisco's highly regarded restaurant in the Campton Place Hotel, who left there five years ago to open a restaurant in The Lark Creek Inn in Larkspur, population 12,000, about 14 miles north of the city. It continues to thrive, a countrified restaurant only 15 minutes from downtown San Francisco. In early July another well-known chef put down stakes in Larkspur: Roland Passot, the amiable French owner of the cozy La Folie in San Francisco. Mr. Passot's new brasserie-style venture, called the Left Bank, represents his longtime passion for a simple, friendly place "where people can drop in and have just oysters and a glass of wine or a full meal."
The Left Bank, on the ground level of The Blue Rock Inn, a former hotel that is now an apartment building, is a big, cheery place, a pale yellow expanse with a stone fireplace and simply appointed tables. A bar menu includes French staples like croque-monsieur; the Mediterranean pizza, pissaladiere, and rillettes of pork and duck. The long wooden bar has an easygoing, neighborly feeling -- two of our nibbling neighbors were Mr. Ogden and his wife, Jody, taking a night off from their own restaurant.
From the main menu we sampled a lovely onion and leek tart with a bracing foundation of smoked bacon, and a pleasing warm melange of mussels, roasted artichokes and garlic. Main courses range from the whimsically named, like the roasted eggplant sandwich "Jacques Pepin" with mozzarella and sun-dried tomatoes, to brasserie standards such as hearty roast pork loin Normandy style, with apples, celery, onions and Calvados, or steak with french fries. For those who like quenelles, the scallop version here is light and full flavored, served with a tomato, olive and mushroom sauce. One of the few letdowns is dry and underseasoned rillettes.
The most entertaining -- and delicious -- dessert is a frothy shake of blueberries, milk and ice cream in a tall cone-shaped glass, garnished with straw-shaped cookies. It is available in a variety of fresh berry flavors.
 
The French Laundry
The town of Yountville was the home of a popular little restaurant called the French Laundry from 1977 until earlier this year, when it closed for renovations after Thomas Keller purchased it. In the late 1980's, Mr. Keller was the chef at a restaurant called Rakel in Manhattan, and later in Los Angeles at the Checkers Hotel Kempinski. The French Laundry reopened early last month.
The new Keller establishment, a delightful 90-minute drive up Route 29 in the Napa Valley through amber hills punctuated by expanses of dark green vines, is a bucolic gem. The two-level cottage is done in understated ivory tones with gentle lighting and sprays of fresh flowers. Mr. Keller serves sophisticated contemporary American cuisine that is authoritatively seasoned, artfully presented and usually surprising in one way or another. On the current menu are dishes like pan-sauteed California squab with braised red mustard greens, bacon-wrapped saddle of rabbit with roasted fennel and herb-crusted New England codfish with a ragout of summer vegetables.
A concentrated "martini" of crystalline tomato water infused with fresh herbs tastes like summer liquefied. A golden disk of quarter-sized sauteed potato slices is topped with unusually tasty summer truffles. Mr. Keller also serves a ripe tomato terrine with a warm red onion marmalade and chives, and a chilled fricassee of fresh baby artichokes in a basil-infused olive oil.
For a main course, perfectly cooked salmon is served on a plate dusted with spicy orange-based powder with a lovely citric sauce. An enticingly lacquered squab suffers from dryness, however.
One of the more diverting desserts is "coffee and doughnuts," little cinnamon doughnuts served with cups of cappuccino semifreddo. Sorbets and ice creams are terrific, as is the warm Valhrona chocolate truffle cake with caramel cream.
 
Stars Oakville Cafe
Two miles up Route 29, the town of Oakville, ringed by the wineries Mondavi, Opus One, Vichon and Robert Pepi, is also distinguished by a restaurant owned by a celebrated California chef. Stars Oakville Cafe, which Jeremiah Tower of Stars and Stars Cafe in San Francisco opened last October, is modest looking from the outside, a squat white building off the main highway. The front dining room is as stark as a contemporary gallery, with framed photographs and artwork surrounding cafe tables.
At this time of year a larger dining area is open in the back under a green-and-white striped tent facing a garden and aviary. The day we were there a cook was tending a whole baby lamb that was rotating over a wood fire -- unfortunately it was for a private party that evening to which we were not invited.
All the salads can be recommended, their ingredients so fresh they appear to have been relayed from a local garden by a sprinter. The golden onion tart is a paragon, lusciously sweet and with a perfect crust. Not so an attractive but lackluster appetizer of marinated gulf prawns, roasted sweet pepper and mint.
Among the main courses for lunch is a wonderful cherry-smoked pork chop, as thick as the San Francisco Yellow Pages, and remarkably moist and tender. It comes with roasted eggplant and marinated tomatoes. Another restorative entree is the wood-oven-roasted chicken cut up and served amid a Tuscan-style bread salad. Desserts are simple and satisfying, especially the ripe little strawberry tartlet and the chocolate hazelnut torte.
 
Catahoula
About six miles north of Oakville on Route 29, on the northern fringe of the Napa Valley, is an engagingly rustic new place, Catahoula, run by another Campton Place alumnus, Jan Birnbaum. Housed in the Mount View Hotel and Spa, the restaurant specializes in wood-oven roasting, which is done in a brick oven with a roaring fire in view of diners. Given Mr. Birnbaum's comforting and copious specialties it is nice to know that there is a treadmill on the premises, even if you have no intention of touching it.
The main dining room, with its cement floor, heavy wooden tables, and industrial-looking abstract sculpture, is a refreshing change from the more mannered restaurants that dot the valley. Mr. Birnbaum, a hearty and generous man, reinforces that theme. A Louisiana native, he worked with Paul Prudhomme at K-Paul's Louisiana Kitchen in New Orleans before heading north, eventually taking over the kitchen of Campton Place.
Starters include nicely charred wood-oven pizza with spicy andouille sausage; spicy rooster gumbo, and two seasonal dishes, crawfish tamales stoked with three kinds of hot peppers, and fried crawfish salad with pickled jalapenos and carrots. Among the more unusual main courses are roast loin of pork scented with lavender and ringed with fresh figs, a moist baby chicken served in a broth with summer vegetables, and a striped bass fillet with a shellfish and rice mixture. Catahoula -- it is named for the state dog of Louisiana -- has a good wine selection well suited to this robust food. Meals are also served around a pool behind the spa -- but given Mr. Birnbaum's full-plate tendencies, this might not be a place to test your buoyancy.
 
 
 
TWO ADDITIONS TO CITY'S MENU
 A second stage of the San Francisco restaurant boom continues to gain momentum, and two relatively new places visited recently -- one American, one French -- are worth seeking out. Prices are per person for a three-course meal with wine, but not including tax and tip.
The five-month-old Rubicon, a stylish brick-and-wood establishment with snug booths along one wall and a semi-exposed kitchen on the other, is named after a wine produced by Francis Ford Coppola in Napa County. Mr. Coppola is one of Rubicon's owners, along with Drew Nieporent, a well-known New York restaurateur.
The chef, Traci Des Jardins, most recently worked at the cross-cultural Elka restaurant in San Francisco, and before that in Los Angeles with Joachim Splichal at the renowned Patina.
Rubicon's contemporary American menu includes such winners as rare slices of lamb over basil mashed potatoes with fava beans, grilled John Dory with braised onions, truffle oil and salsify, and Muscovy duck breast with a fruit compote and shiitake ravioli. The wine list is exceptionally well chosen, both for price and for its compatability with the food.
Rubicon, at 558 Sacramento Street in San Francisco, is open for lunch Monday to Friday and dinner Monday to Saturday. Lunch is $25, dinner $35. All major credit cards accepted. Phone (415) 434-4100).
Year-old Bizou, in a San Francisco neighborhood known as SOMA (South of Market Street), is bright and upbeat, swabbed glowing yellow outside and ocher-toned within. A relaxing spot for lunch, it is more animated in the evening.
The chef, Loretta Keller, came from Jeremiah Tower's Stars and Stars Cafe. At lunch recently, a sweet pepper stuffed with a mildly seasoned brandade de morue (seasoned pureed salt cod) was served with a snappy caper sauce. Crispy homemade flatbread is a perfect accompaniment. An unusual and compelling entree is called beef-and-potato straw cake, a loosely bound melange of julienned potatoes, onions, peppers and beef redolent of thyme.
Typical dinner entrees include wood-oven baked quail with sweet corn, roasted chilis and barley pilaf, and beef cheeks with mustard, watercress and new potatoes.
Bizou, 598 Fourth Street at Brannan, is open for lunch Monday to Friday and dinner Monday to Saturday. Lunch is $20, dinner $30. Visa, Mastercard, American Expresss; (415) 543-2222.

HEADLINE: Another View Of an Airport

 BODY:
The article describing the expansion plans at Sikorsky Memorial Airport ("Aftermath of a Crash: Should an Airport Grow?" July 31) left out several important issues.
The airport is geographically challenged. It is surrounded on all sides by the Town of Stratford, Long Island Sound and the Housatonic River. There is very little room for a lengthened runway, an access road and the existing structures. 
 The two major corporate residents of the area, Sikorsky and Lycoming, both military contractors, are downsizing or consolidating, and the most active airline operator, Business Express, has restructured, laid off 15 percent of its workforce, and moved its management from Westport to Portsmouth, N.H. Corporate aviation growth forecasts are paltry at best. Do these facts support commercial arguments for airport expension?
In severe weather, Long Island Sound and the Housatonic River have flooded the runways, suspending airport operations. Will the runways be elevated? Will dikes be built? Will this have any consequences for the ecology of the area surrounding the airport?
As for safety concerns, a startling piece of information has been ignored or downplayed. At the eastern end of the runway to be lengthened, almost directly in the runway centerline, stands a large occupied condominium complex complete with marina. Not too many years ago a small private plane, departing from the runway in question, lost power and was forced down in a field just yards to the west of the condominiums.
Luckily, there were no injuries, but it was made very clear that the proximity of this complex to the airport presents a clear and present danger. With a longer runway, allowing operations of larger aircraft, the margin of safety is even further diminished.
Doesn't lengthening the runway increase the probability of a more tragic accident?
Given the local weather conditions, given the fact that the tower is shut down after 10 P.M., given the fact that the residents of Milford, already in the flight path for departures to the east, would be dealing with larger aircraft climbing out at lower altitudes, with whose safety is the commission really concerned?
What is the real motivation for this entire issue? Prior to the accident, the commission was clamoring to expand the airport for commercial reasons. Immediately following the possibility of Donald Trump building a casino in Bridgeport, airport expansion became a hot topic. And now we have a Donald Trump amusement park proposal. And a greyhound track proposal.
Could the commission's chairman, the Mayor of Bridgeport, have multiple agendas? Remember, this is the Mayor who chose not to stand in the way of the Unification Church's takeover of the University of Bridgeport. This is the Mayor who predicted new job creation in the depressed area surrounding the university. Should we really trust his judgments?
Who pays the bill for airport expansion?
Who will reap the benefits of airport expansion?
Many years ago, the city of Portland, Ore., decided that the road to prosperity was going to be a freeway that would bisect the city. After years of pitched battle, the city decided to modify its arrogant stance and try a new approach. It would enlist the help and cooperation of all the communities affected by the proposed freeway in an effort to improve the city's traffic problems and to end the conflict with the neighborhoods.
Portland did not build a freeway. Portland did not create new slums, create more tensions between the haves and the have nots. What it did was create a trolley-based transportation system that did not undermine the economic and social values of the neighborhoods it serves. It built a system and innovatively solved a problem in a way that increased the value of the city and guaranteed its future as a mighty nice place to live.
It would be nice if the City of Bridgeport could borrow from Portland's experience. The Mayor has enormous problems facing him. His focus should be on solutions with social value and long-term economic returns within the borders of his fair city. He should spend less time worrying about his outpost airport. He should try working with, not fighting against, the residents of Stratford.
And most importantly, he should be sure he knows the cause of the recent tragedy at the airport before he sets the stage for an even greater tragedy.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/Lease Buyouts;
As the Market Firms, Tenants Can Get Off the Hook

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
UNTIL recently, a tenant that wanted to buy its way out of a lease was pretty much out of luck. With prime real estate going begging throughout the recession-ravaged city -- and with financially troubled tenants demonstrating a tendency to default on their rents -- few landlords would let reliable bill-payers out of their lease obligations. The few that did asked such high prepayment penalties that tenants went scurrying after sublessees anyway.
Times are changing. As the real estate market continues to firm up, more and more landlords are letting tenants out of leases, for as little as half their remaining obligation. 
 In fact, many actually welcome the chance to accommodate new tenants who are likely to stay well beyond the original tenant's lease expiration date. And many welcome even more the opportunity to combine the departing tenant's space with other space in the building to create a larger, and thus more marketable, block of contiguous floors.
"Lease buyouts are a classic win/win situation," said Robert Constable, a managing director at the real estate firm Edward S. Gordon. "The tenant gets to avoid risk and consolidate its balance sheet and the landlord reduces downtime between tenants."
Examples abound. The Cigna Insurance Company had two years left on a floor at 1185 Avenue of the Americas, at 47th Street. W&M Properties, the building's manager, was having no luck renting the vacant floor below Cigna. So Anthony E. Malkin, W&M's president, let Cigna buy its way out of its lease and began marketing the two floors together.
"We actually had two tenants compete for the two-floor block," Mr. Malkin said.
Gerald W. Griffin, a partner at Cooper & Dunham, helped get the two floors for his law firm. Mr. Malkin, who has done several lease buy-out deals at W&M properties in Stamford, Conn., wants to do more at 1185. He will probably take back Cigna's remaining floor, as well as a floor from another tenant that wants to give up space, and again market them as a two-floor block.
Management at 199 Water Street, near Fulton Street, went through similar maneuvers to attract the big news agency Reuters. It let Lloyds Bank buy its way out of 30,000 square feet, even though Lloyds was paying more than $50 a square foot and had 10 years left on the lease. The reason: Reuters was looking for 90,000 square feet and the building had only 60,000 square feet to give it.
"If Reuters hadn't been in the wings, Lloyds would still be looking to sublet," said Mr. Constable, who represented Lloyds.
Sometimes a departing tenant has enough space on its own to make a lease buyout palatable. Quantum Chemical, which had two years left on a lease for 72,000 square feet at 99 Park Avenue, at 40th Street, was making no bones about its plans to move to Cincinnati.
"It seemed a good time to find a credit-worthy, long-term tenant," said Bruce Mosler, a vice chairman at Galbreath Riverbank, who handles the building's leasing. He let Quantum out of its obligations for half of what its remaining cost would have been and rented the space to R.R. Donnelly, the printing firm, for 15 years.
Not everyone is enamored of the buyout concept. Many tenants either do not have the cash to make a large upfront payment or don't want to confront their shareholders or boards with that prospect.
Some landlords are equally reluctant to confront their lenders or investors with deals that terminate a stable source of cash flow.
"I have a fiduciary responsiblity to get every dime of cash flow I can get," said Joseph T. Wright, a senior vice president of JMB Realty, which manages 1211 Avenue of the Americas, at 47th Street.
Indeed, most tenants whose leases are winding down now are paying above-market rents. Yet most landlords believe Manhattan rents are creeping up again. Many cannot see the logic of letting a tenant who is paying, say, $40 a square foot in a building that commands no more than $30 now, end its lease when chances are good that, when the lease term ends, the space can be rented out for more than it can be today.
Moreover, by waiting, they can also put off paying for tenant improvements, broker's commissions and other costs of doing a deal.
"I'M still better off getting cash flow now and putting off new deals until concession packages are down and rents are up," said Caleb D. Koeppel, vice chairman of Koeppel Tener Real Estate Services, which manages 26 Broadway, at Beaver Street, and 575 Lexington Avenue, near 51st Street.
Still, arguments for buying space back seem to outnumber those against. Tenants with a few years left on a lease have little chance of subletting. Those with a more marketable term often do not want the headache of being a sublessee's landlord -- or the risk of having the sublessee default. And commissions and tenant improvements can be as costly in a sublet deal as they are when a landlord is renting space direct.
Sometimes tenants can even spread out the cost of buying out their lease. Mitsui Fudosan, which owns 1251 Avenue of the Americas, at 49th Street, took back 226,000 square feet under lease to Coopers & Lybrand, the accounting firm, to provide Kidder Peabody with the 350,000 square feet it wanted. No cash changed hands; the Japanese owner sublet back much of the accounting firm's space, thus reducing the rent paid rather than exacting a lump payout.
One reason Mitsui was so agreeable: Kidder is paying several dollars a square foot more in rent than Coopers was paying. No one involved would say whether Mitsui took a large profit or whether it gave the departing tenant a deal on a sublet. Barry Gosin, the Newmark & Company chief executive who handles the building's leasing, said simply, "It was a winning situation all around."
Generally, landlords try hard to hide from existing tenants the fact that they need the space for another deal. Tenants, for their part, like to pretend they have sublessees ready to move in. Whoever's bluff gets called generally bears the lion's share of the costs.
Mr. Wright recalls one tenant at his building who paid dearly to get out of the six years left on its lease. Less than a month later, JMB had rerented the space.
"The first tenant did not realize I already had another tenant on my arm, so we got a real home-run deal," Mr. Wright said.
MANY landlords are settling for single-base deals as well. Those with a disturbing number of leases rolling over at the same time often want to write a new lease in an off year, thus easing the risk of sudden high vacancies. Others want to appear to be actively seeking deals. ("Brokers who see you as proactive will ask if you can make space available, rather than just rely on what you're actively marketing," Mr. Malkin noted.).
And some owners just don't like to gamble. After all, no one can be sure that a new tenant will show up when an existing lease runs out. As for rising rents -- well, everyone knows what happened to hapless owners in the mid-80's who gambled that the real estate boom would last forever.
In fact, some of the more conservative owners are letting tenants buy out of some space in exchange for agreeing to stay longer in the space that remains. James B. Frederick, a principal at Colliers ABR, recently represented a tenant that wanted to shed 10,000 of its 70,000 square feet. The tenant's space was on low floors that the owner knew he would have trouble re-renting. So he let the tenant turn back the small fraction of space, in return for extending its lease for an extra five years on the remainder.
"The owner felt that keeping a large credit-worthy ) tenant in the building's base would add to the building's financial stability," Mr. Frederick recalled.
Sometimes landlords will agree to lease buyouts because it lets them remeasure the space. First City Securities, a financial services firm, had three years left on a lease for what, 12 years ago, had been rented as a 6,450-square-foot floor at 767 Third Avenue, at 48th Street. Since then the owner had remeasured the building and is now renting the floors at 6,850 square feet. He found a new tenant for the "larger" floor, and let First City buy out for what came to about 60 percent of its remaining obligation.
"The change in the way the space was measured, combined with the strengthening market, made the deal work," said Mr. Frederick, who represented First City.
Chances are that, as the market continues to strengthen, landlords will need fewer and fewer extenuating circumstances to agree to lease buyouts. In fact, some are even considering letting existing tenants out of leases before new tenants show up.
"Two years ago I would have needed a new tenant's signed lease in hand before I'd even consider letting an old tenant off the hook," said Peter di Capua, a senior vice president at ATCO Corporation, which manages several Manhattan buildings. "In this market I'm more likely to bet on the come."

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living In/Tarrytown;
Rich History, Picturesque River Setting

BYLINE: By TESSA MELVIN 

 BODY:
THE cross-country team at Sleepy Hollow High School represents a student body from 14 countries. It trains on the paths of the Rockefeller family estate and it competes under the banner of the headless horseman, the school mascot.
Welcome to Tarrytown, a village with rich and varied historical and cultural roots and a splendid setting overlooking the three-mile width of the Hudson River. The Dutch called this point, the river's widest, the Tappan Zee -- Tappan probably for a group of Indians and Zee meaning "sea" in Dutch. Wealthy industrialists built estates in its hills and its shores have drawn industries that have employed hundreds of newly arrived immigrants. 
 The past is present in this eclectic village, home to corporate executives as well as to blue-collar workers. Among the remaining mansions is Lyndhurst, the Gothic Revival jewel of the National Trust for Historic Preservation, designed by Alexander Jackson Davis for New York City Mayor William Paulding and completed in 1838. It was later owned by Jay Gould, the railroad financier.
On the waterfront next to and south of the 104-year-old recently restored Victorian railroad station, the county asphalt plant and a recycling plant, among other small industries, still hum. And teen-agers knock balls around in the waterfront Loosee and Pierson Parks. Nearby are the Washington Irving and Tarrytown Boating Clubs with a total of 320 slips.
"Tarrytown is a wonderful, very mixed community with an even more mixed school system," said Kathleen DeFemia, an administrative assistant at Village Hall. "My kids have had friends of all different skin colors, and I think it has made them better people -- it's what the world is all about."
The world has known about Tarrytown for a century and a half, thanks to its legendary equestrian ghost. Who does not know of Brom Bones, Ichabod Crane and the lovely Katrina, made famous by Washington Irving, a noted resident? And Tarrytown also has a place in real history: Major John Andre, the British spy, was captured there as he tried to help Benedict Arnold betray West Point.
After a century as an active river port and a regional industrial center, Tarrytown entered its golden age in this century as a mecca for the wealthy. Home to industrial tycoons including William E. Dodge, a merchant and philanthropist; J.D. Maxwell, an automobile pioneer, and several members of the Lehman banking family. It also attracted Albert Bierstadt, the landscape painter, and Samuel L. Clemens.
With the Rockefellers and other prominent families in North Tarrytown, the area was dubbed "the millionaire's colony." Tarrytown incorporated as a village in 1870, adjacent North Tarrytown in 1874.
Modern Tarrytown is a transportation hub connecting Westchester and Rockland Counties with New York City via excellent train connections and the Tappan Zee Bridge, which connects to I-287, Westchester's major east-west highway. Traffic has also been the village's biggest nightmare.
When it was built in 1955, the bridge was considered a boon to development. Office parks sprang up and hotels as well, among them the Tarrytown Hilton and the Westchester Marriott. But few were prepared for the traffic that threatened to choke off the village as frustrated rush-hour commuters tried to get onto the Tappan Zee by seeking alternative routes through the village.
"It used to be a disaster," Ms. DeFemia recalled, "especially on Friday nights. You couldn't even go out for a quart of milk."
Peace returned after last year's agreement by the state to install a removable barrier on the bridge, freeing an extra lane for Westchester-bound traffic in the morning and an extra lane westbound in the evenings.
A COMMUTER bus service bringing Rockland County residents to the train has also helped, said Eileen Pilla, Mayor of Tarrytown for the last decade. She presides over a village board that six years ago approved a revised a master plan, in the process rezoning the village near the bridge to reduce density.
"Development was overtaking events," said Mayor Pilla. "We wanted more open space and we wanted to prevent such dense development it would take away from the attractiveness of the community."
In 1980 village officials rejected a proposal for a shopping center on the site of what is now the Talleyrand Office Park, opting to revitalize the downtown shopping district instead. This has gone slowly, but momentum is building with technical assistance from the New York Main Street Alliance, a nonprofit group based in Mount Kisco that is dedicated to preserving the state's downtowns.
Residents hope their historic past and a spruced-up downtown will be keys to their economic future as the region's industrial tax base declines. Taxpayers in the two villages are concerned about the announced departure of the General Motors assembly plant in North Tarrytown, planned for 1996. Although the plant pays no village taxes in Tarrytown, it contributes almost 10 percent of the consolidated school budget.
Mayor Sean Treacy of North Tarrytown said his village was actively seeking developers for the 98-acre site as the Sleepy Hollow Seaport, with a marina, a mix of shops and housing and an automobile museum.
The region has become an increasingly popular tourist destination because of Sunnyside, Washington Irving's home; Kykuit, the Rockeller family home, and Philipsburg Manor Upper Mills in North Tarrytown. .
Today, Main Street looks remarkably as it does in photos taken 50 years ago, with three- and four-story Victorian storefronts dominating the street. After the designation of the street as a local historic landmark in 1980, shopkeepers had to get permission to make architectural changes.
Antiques shops abound, mixed with delis, clothing stores and restaurants featuring Italian, Mexican and Portuguese specialities.
The most prominent building on Main Street is the Queen Anne style Music Hall, built in 1885 to bring grand opera and vaudeville to the village and be the site of an annual flower show. It is now a thriving performing arts center where this summer Arlo Guthrie and the New Orleans Preservation Hall band, among others, performed.
The clearest sign of diversity is Tarrytown's housing stock, from the tiny rowhouses in the inner village to the elegant free-standing brownstones on North Washington Street to the rambling Victorians in Wilson Park. About 40 percent of the 4,311 housing units in Tarrytown are one-families, including several Hudson River Victorians with fine river views.
Aside from a scattered lot here and there, no new housing has been built in the village since the mid-80's, said Michael Blau, Village Administrator. There is little available land, he said, except for about 220 acres in the south end of the village owned by the Unification Church.
ONE of the most luxurious condominiums among 12 complexes in the village is Carrollwood, where a total of 208 two- and three-bedroom units surround Axe Castle, once known as Carrollcliffe. The castle was purchased last March by a group of investors headed by Hanspeter Walder, a Tarrytown resident, is now seeking approval for an inn/restaurant in the 94-year-old Norman-style castle.
In Tarrycrest, a one-family-home neighborhood, three-and four-bedroom ranches and colonials sell for $225,000 to $325,000. Several surround the fields of the Hackley School, a private co-ed day and five-day boarding school. Others are near the Tarrycrest Swim Club, a private club with tennis courts, and some are near the two Tarrytown Lakes, a back-up reservoir where people fish in the summer and skate in the winter.
Beyond the lakes is the Wilson Park neighborhood, which many brokers consider the most prestigious part of town and where some Victorians sell for $600,000 and up. Residents are surrounded by open space, most of it owned by the Rockefeller family, and by the four-year, 700-student Marymount College, a private women's college.
Brian and Carol Kelly bought their rambling white colonial on a hill in the neighborhood because of its river views and its proxmity to both Kykuit, at the end of the street, and the downtown, just a walk away. Mr. Kelly, an advertising executive with Ammirati & Puris, looks forward to weekends when the couple take Sarah, 3, and Will, 5 months, on long rambles at Kykuit, accompanied by Abbie, their golden retriever.
Next year, Sarah will enter the Tappan Hill School in Tarrytown, one of six schools in the consolidated system, each designated for particular grade levels. Like most children in Tarrytown, Sarah will stay for two years, then enter first grade at the John Paulding School in North Tarrytown, attending the Winfield L. Morse School in North Tarrytown for second and third grades.
The Washington Irving Intermediate School in Tarrytown houses grades 4 through 6 and students return to the Sleepy Hollow Middle School (in North Tarrytown) for grades 7 and 8 and spend their last four years in Tarrytown at Sleepy Hollow High School.
Eighty percent of the 100 members of this year's senior class are headed for further education.
Dr. Donald R. Kusel, the district school superintendent, said the system had been building up a surplus to offset the anticipated loss of revenue from General Motors.
It is a system, he said, that now offers seven languagues, including Russian; 17 advanced placement courses and has recently instituted new math and language arts curriculums.

HEADLINE: THEATER;
'Sayonara' the Musical In Revival in Elmsford

BYLINE: By ALVIN KLEIN; "Sayonara," produced by Westchester Broadway Theater, 1 Broadway Plaza, Elmsford. Performances continue through Sept. 18. The box office number is 592-2222.

DATELINE: ELMSFORD

 BODY:
IN the evolution of a musical, things are meant to change for the better. Consider among the theater's vagaries how a show can devolve into a shadow of once promised substance.
In its 1987 world premiere at the Paper Mill Playhouse in Millburn, N.J., "Sayonara" (from the Michener novel) blossomed; ravishingly so, given a production of visual wonder. Yet, the score (by George Fischoff) and the book (by William Luce) existed almost in separation -- an odd thing for an incurably romantic tale about lives intertwined, those of an ace flier -- they call him Ace -- who falls in love with Hana-ogi, the star of Japan's leading musical theater troupe, and a private (Joe Kelly) who marries a Japanese girl (Katsumi). 
 For all its potential, "Sayonara" the musical, in the language of show business, did not have legs -- until last year when a revised version opened at Theater Under the Stars in Houston, leading to other stagings and revisions. The show at the Westchester Broadway Theater, its management says, is approximately 75 percent changed and almost entirely recast since the New Jersey opening.
And it is newly directed by Philip Wm. McKinley, who has been in charge of "Sayonara" productions in five cities in the past year. It is in Mr. McKinley's staging that the better changes are best reflected.
In a new production concept, the Takarazuka numbers, now less flamboyant but far more functional and considerably more frequent, deliberately exist on the fringe of the story. That would theoretically strengthen the book songs if only they were less disposable. Still, a new emphasis on showiness provides a theatrical urgency, which recalls the fantasy numbers in "Kiss of the Spider Woman" and the score as accompaniment in the film "Cabaret."
Mr. McKinley's direction, in its interweaving of book and musical scenes, is more seamless than Mr. Luce's writing, jolting as that tries to be from the first scene, a nasty piece of military meanness that leads to the story in flashback.
Besides a removable overlay of sentimentality, "Sayonara" suffers an irreversible point of view problem, which does not have to go out of its way to offend. To perpetuate the notion that the Japanese "girl," as opposed to the American "dish," has the genetic predisposition to please a man -- and to trick him into marriage -- is to turn "Sayonara" into a musical in praise of geisha training rather than an East-is-East, West-is-West take on star-crossed lovers.
And the Japanese woman who marries the American man can look forward to a permanent name change, as from Katsumi to Babe.
That government legislation lifting the "forbidden" act of "flagrant fraternization" between American soldiers and Japanese women (and what's more, allowing Americans to take their Japanese wives back to the States) was passed a year after these events, which occurred in occupied Japan in 1952, makes of the "Sayonara" story an ephemeral thing. To reiterate the legal changes in the context of the musical is to negate the author's accent on sacrifice and a climactic try for tragedy.
There is simply no real inevitability, tragic or circumstantial, in the separate resolutions of the two interracial couples. In one case, it might be more plausible to opt for the sentimentalized ending of the 1957 movie -- a change reportedly made at the insistence of the star, Marlon Brando.
And given a shift in global economic power, which adds to "Sayonara" the aftertaste of a whole meal of leftovers, force-fed, the preachy tone of Mr. Luce's writing is pointless. A period piece is a period piece. The contemporary validation of "Sayonara," musical or otherwise, must be found in its theatrical adornments.
In spite of one or two silly smoky pit effects -- given theater trends, if there's a smoke machine, use it -- the production benefits from the graceful scenery by Gregory Hill, with all manner of ornamentation including bamboo branches, lanterns, streamers, masks, fireworks, a puppet show and a delicate moving bridge.
In a score more extenuated than enhanced by time, the title song and the ballad "Where You Go" remain winning, though Hi Gilbert's lyrics (sample: "You'll always be so very near and yet so far away") remain losers.
Joseph Mahowald is an efficient Ace, Michael O'Steen, an ace Kelly. Tony Gilbert, one remaining member of the original cast, plays one of the musical theater's wormiest villains, Col. Calhoun Craford. Frances Epsen and Judith McCauley have the insufferable roles of Ace's American fiancee and mother-in-law-to-be -- the first insufferably noble, the second insufferably ignoble.
Sala Iwamatsu has an air of authority and vulnerability as Hana-ogi, but Ako appears trapped by coy stereotyping in the role of Katsumi. In its second life, "Sayonara" has to search for a third -- and again, for legs.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: SCHUYLERVILLE;
New to the 'New' Bronx: New Cars

BYLINE: By MONIQUE P. YAZIGI 

 BODY:
"Everyone said we were crazy, that it would never last," says Barry Milea, the 42-year-old president of Milea Truck Sales Corporation. That was 13 years ago, when Mr. Milea and his cousins, Robert Milea and Albert Sanfilippo, opened their truck dealership in the South Bronx.
But after years of working "around the clock," Barry Milea says, and setting up his living quarters above the dealership office, the partners proved the skeptics wrong. Milea Truck Sales, which is at 885 East 149th Street at the corner of Bruckner Boulevard, has sales of $40 million a year and 150 employees. 
 And last Tuesday, the partners once again defied the traditional wisdom, at a groundbreaking ceremony for the Bronx's first new car-and-truck dealership in a decade. "Everyone thinks this is a low-income borough," said Mr. Milea, "but they're wrong. It's a middle-income borough where people need cars."
The new enterprise, Milea Pontiac/GMC Truck, is located at 3211-3215 East Tremont Avenue, at the corner of Waterbury Avenue in Schuylerville.
For years, there were a handful of new-car dealerships along with the dozens of used-car lots on Jerome Avenue north of 170th street. Most of them moved out, said William Bollinger, director of planning and development for the South Bronx Overall Economic Development Corporation, because of high taxes and low security.
"Car dealerships tend to cluster together, and when one moved out, the others followed," Mr. Bollinger said.
Other auto-related businesses, like parking garages and car-repair services, took their place. "We're still trying to figure out what to do with that strip," he said.
The new dealership is scheduled to open in January and will create 50 new jobs, Barry Milea said.
Nancy Mendelson, a spokeswoman for the development corporation, commenting on the Milea partners' decision to expand, said: "Slowly, there's a recognition that there's a huge market in the Bronx, especially with all the new housing going up. We are not building apartments, but new houses with garages and driveways." MONIQUE P. YAZIGI

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: WASHINGTON HEIGHTS;
Mixed Notices, in Advance, For Memorial to Malcolm X

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY 

 BODY:
Sometime this fall, three artists -- a muralist and two sculptors -- are expected to emerge from their studios with final plans for a memorial to Malcolm X.
Selected from among nearly 100 applicants, the artists have won the right to place their works in an area of the Audubon Ballroom where Malcolm X was assassinated. That section of the ballroom, which is on Broadway between West 165th and 166th Streets, will be preserved while Columbia University builds a long-disputed biomedical research complex around it. 
 But many members of the Save the Audubon Ballroom Coalition, which opposed the compromise that is preserving a little more than half of the original ballroom, say they believe the memorial will be a sham. Elombe Brath, a member of the coalition and a graphic artist, compares it to saving only a portion of Ford's Theater in Washington, where Lincoln was shot, in order to build a factory around it.
"I think what it's going to end up to be is just a small acknowledgement that there was a fight to save it," Mr. Brath said. "There was such a rich history to the place, and I don't think this memorial will reflect any of that."
But the plan has many supporters, including Dr. Betty Shabazz, Malcolm X's widow, and Dr. Howard Dodson, director of the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture. Both are members of the Malcolm X Memorial Commission, which was created by Mayor David N. Dinkins to oversee the project.
The ballroom fell into disrepair after it was closed in the 1970's because of unpaid taxes. The battle to save it and to keep the research center from being built, raged for more than a decade. In the end, the center's developers -- Columbia, the city's Economic Development Corporation and the New York State Urban Development Corporation -- agreed to save 55 percent of the original ballroom, including the stage where Malcolm X was gunned down on Feb. 21, 1965. Retail outlets and a mental-health clinic will share the space with the memorial.
Daniel Galvez, a muralist from Oakland, Calif., and two Manhattan sculptors, Gabriel Koren and Colin Chase, will present finished drawings and models for the memorial, which will then be reviewed by city and community groups.
"What I want to do is essentially to portray visually what everybody has already seen of images from his life so they can draw from it what they will," Mr. Galvez said. "I'm really trying to capture the meat of his life." RANDY KENNEDY

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: RED HOOK/GOWANUS;
Southwest Brooklyn Presses Its Economic Case

BYLINE: By GARRY PIERRE-PIERRE 

 BODY:
There are no greengrocers, no pharmacies, no bakeries in Red Hook. Gowanus has no health services -- the nearest public clinic is about two miles away, in Fort Greene, and hard to reach because of a lack of public transportation.
Local officials have begun looking to new state and Federal programs to boost the economy in southwest Brookyn. Last month, the area that encompasses Red Hook, Gowanus and Sunset Park was chosen by the state as one of 21 new enterprise zones. 
 Now, the recently formed Southwest Brooklyn Enterprise Community, a collection of 40 organizations that include block associations, small-business groups and community boards, is campaigning to have the area declared a Federal enterprise community. The program is part of a Clinton Administration plan to free up $9 million in city, state and Federal funds to spur economic growth in each of 65 urban areas around the country.
Some development officials and community leaders contend that local enterprise programs often do little beyond shuffle jobs and businesses from one area to another within a designated area. But the state says its enterprise-zone program has helped create 4,500 new jobs and has stimulated almost $750 million in business investment.
"This is a very dynamic time right now, and we're all looking ahead to brighter days," said Craig Hammerman, the district manager of Community Board 6, which covers Red Hook, Gowanus and parts of Sunset Park. "We want to take vacant storefronts and put life into them."
The state designation is intended to help neighborhoods keep existing businesses and attract new ones with tax credits, low-interest loans, reduced property taxes and discounted utility bills.
The new Federal enterprise communities will be announced in November. Meanwhile, state and local officials say that Washington's decision will depend largely on the lobbying efforts mounted by the neighborhoods and the support shown by city and state officials and Congressional representatives.
The Federal designation is also being sought by the South Bronx and the Grand Concourse and Crotona Park East, also in the Bronx; the greater Williamsburg-Navy Yard and Bedford-Stuyvesant in Brooklyn, and South Jamaica, Queens.
Areas like southwest Brooklyn that have won the state enterprise designation have an advantage, said Bette Stoltz, the executive director of the South Brooklyn Local Development Corporation, a nonprofit community organization, because they can show they have widespread support and a mechanism in place to make use of the money.
The enterprise community program is separate from another Federal plan to designate six blighted urban areas as "empowerment zones" and award them each $100 million in grants and other benefits. A section of the City, including parts of Harlem and the South Bronx, is expected to win this designation.
If southwest Brooklyn receives the Federal designation, community leaders say, the $9 million will be used to market and promote local businesses and to develop job training programs in the area's existing maritime, construction and trucking industries. There are also plans to make low-interest loans available to small-business owners. GARRY PIERRE-PIERRE

Hair Wars: Underground on 125th Street

SERIES: The Bottom Rung: A periodic look at new immigrants' struggles to gain an economic foothold in New York.

BYLINE: By CLAUDINE WILLIAMS 

 BODY:
IT IS 10 A.M., and 125th Street is choked with people trying to weave past vendors selling T-shirts, African trinkets and jewelry. Mounas G. and several other women in colorful African print dresses stand outside a storefront that has no sign and eye the passing parade. In particular, they look for those lingering at the photographs on the storefront's windows.
"Miss, Miss, do you want to get your hair done?" Mounas asks one shopper, who immediately points to a photo of an elaborate braid style. 
 "This, can you do this?" she asks.
Mounas smiles and says, "Seventy dollars." The customer nods and is ushered into another world.
Call it a makeshift hair-braiding factory. Mounas and two dozen other women sit on high stools, their fingers manipulating clumps of hair into intricate patterns and styles. The women are so crammed together that it is difficult for them to work without bumping elbows with their neighbors. And it is hot. Four fans move air around the salon. Every now and then a braider adjusts a fan to give a burst of air to a customer who is fanning herself.
There are no mirrors on the walls. When a braid is done, the customer holds a jagged, cracked mirror up to her face. Sometimes she is taken next door to use the mirrors at the Subway sandwich store.
The shop is one of the many braiding salons that seem to crop up overnight along 125th Street and around the city to meet the growing demand for African-inspired braiding. They have become a refuge for Caribbean and African immigrants trying to stay afloat, allowing them to use skills they learned in their homelands. But the shops have also raised questions about sanitary practices; partly with those in mind, the State Legislature recently wrote language into the cosmetology law that specifically requires braiders to be licensed.
Mounas, a 43-year-old Senegalese immigrant who lives in a one-bedroom apartment in West Harlem, says the shop helps her make ends meet when her cabdriver husband is out of work and she needs money for her baby daughter or to send back home.
She says she learned about the shop a year ago through word of mouth and began renting a station. Over the year, more women came to set up their stations, and now there is barely space for one more braider.
"We never turn anyone down." she says. "Friends work here. Relatives come in to help. But now it is so full, I don't think we are taking any more people."
Many established braiders who are proud of the craft of locking and twisting and weaving hair into intricate patterns feel that some of the new shops diminish the status of their profession through poor standards and the use of quick-buck techniques like pulling in people from the streets. Some are also bothered by the immigrants' claims of "authentic" braiding, which they say implies that the work of American black women is somehow less genuine. Still, they say they are eager to pull the immigrants into the mainstream.
"When I saw that shop on 125th, I was stunned," said Diane Bailey, the vice president of International Braiders Network, a trade group with 300 members. "My eyes filled with tears. It was a sweat shop. There was not any order. People had combs stuck in their mouths and in their hair. That simply is not safe."
"Braiding is about nurturing natural care," said Ms. Bailey, a member of a state advisory committee on cosmetology. "It is not about a quick service. We are not the McDonald's of hair care. In 20 years we will not be looked at as hair braiders. We will be looked at as hustlers."
Mounas agrees that cleanliness can be a problem. "Some people are clean, some people are dirty. That is why I want to open my own shop and keep it clean. I have 10 combs. When I go home, I wash them one by one and put them in paper towels."
The work itself is difficult and stressful, requiring long hours of concentration and repetitive motions. A braider working too hard may find her fingers swelling and her back aching. Some develop eye trouble.
But in the low-paying universe of the immigrants, the pay can be fairly good. Mounas says she rents her station for $140 a month and works several days a week, charging from $70 for an uncomplicated braid to $200 for a difficult and time-consuming pattern that takes all day. Those rates are slightly higher than what is offered by others in the shop. In a regular salon, the cost could be twice that; the job could take twice as long.
Mounas is paid in cash, which is one the reasons she insisted her last name not be used. On a busy day, she may have as many as four customers.
"Some days I get three," she says. "Some days I get two people. Some days no one comes. But it does not last long. People always want to get their hair done."
Mounas's specialty is a braid called the Senegalese twist, a style in which natural hair is twisted with synthetic hair or a wool fiber into tiny single braids that resemble rope. She imports the wool from Senegal.
For the braiders, the skill was easy to learn. Mounas was taught by her cousins in Senegal.
Gladys Esowe, a Nigerian, said: "In Africa, we grow up with it. We have an open market. So anyone who wants to braid hair can go there. We would cook for the person in exchange for them teaching us how to braid. You just find a comb."
Ms. Esowe, who is 43, said she was trained as a housekeeper but is having trouble because she can't get a work permit.
"I tried and tried to find work without a permit," she said. "I got frustrated. I was walking down the street one day about three months ago and I saw this place. What should I do? I don't have any alternative. I like to work. I want to work."
Most of the braiders are either illegal immigrants or have no work permits; Mounas says she has a green card and a permit. None of the braiders are licensed, so they often must move from shop to shop.
The women know little of the new licensing law or its grandfather clause giving braiders until next July to avoid enrollment in a cosmetology school by providing proof of experience. But since most fear any contact with the authorities, the transition will be difficult.
"No one ever asks me if I have a license," Mounas says. "If you know how to braid hair, they pay you money."
For Mounas, who came to the United States five years ago, the goal is to keep sending money home to Senegal and eventually return there. America is too violent, she says. Every night she watches the television news and hears about a murder. She wonders if she's next.
"Life was not that hard at home," she said. "There was no violence. Africa is poor and people come here to satisfy themselves and their families."
A few days later, the storefront on 125th Street closes down. The shop moves next door. The workers usher customers through a half-closed gate.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: ON THE WATERFRONT;
On Greenpoint's Piers, An Island of Regulars

BYLINE: By GARRY PIERRE-PIERRE 

 BODY:
Posted like silent sentinels all around the town, stand thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries.
Herman Melville, "Moby Dick"
ONCE the city's raison d'etre and the inspiration of poetry and song, the waterfront has fallen to the status of civic embarrassment, its jagged edges and fearsome highways acting as if under divine order to keep us from an expansive view or a salty breeze. 
 Now, in a spasm of municipal will, City Hall is weighing plans to open the land's edge, and officials have a basic design for an "urban boulevard" north from Battery Place on the West Side. As for the park alongside, some worry about stirring the loins of large-scale development.
Protagonists should keep their eyes on the prize, evident on the East River. On a summer day, pockets of folks, scavengers of urban pleasures, expropriate piers and rare parkland in unregulated joy. A pig is roasted. A child roars with delight over a gambling table. Ninetta Galarza sells rum and coke in East River Park. "The King of India Street" reclines on a Greenpoint pier. The scenes serve to mock the forces that conspire to keep us chronically landbound.
Along the abandoned and ramshackle piers off India Street in Greenpoint, a few hardy sun worshipers stretch out on the cracked concrete. Others cast their lines and crab nets into the Brooklyn side of the East River, hoping to catch the day's fare. Every so often a brave soul, or two, dives into the river for a few laps.
Nearby, amid the overgrown weeds, a group of men chat quietly, pounding down a few Budweisers. They toast a Budweiser blimp flying over the gray sky.
 "We're having a great time," says David Ruiz as salsa jangles the still, humid air.
"This is our world, and you're just in it," his friend Paco Velasquez tells a visitor.
This makeshift park attracts neighborhood people: working and unemployed, longtime residents, Polish and Hispanic immigrants. They are people with the imagination to create their own islands of relaxation.
But for all its kindred serenity, the place can get rowdy, particularly after one beer too many. Simple discussions can escalate into fistfights and ethnic name-calling.
"Sometimes a Polish guy and a Spanish guy drink and they have some trouble," said Jerry Urbanski, an unemployed construction worker. "They start talking and end up fighting."
This group has never set foot on Martha's Vineyard; the Hamptons are terra incognita. But India Street will do. And just as some richer people have beach cottages, Hector Malave has his home away from home.
Mr. Malave is known as the "King of India Street." His habitat consists of stacks of boxes filled with bottles and other knickknacks from nearby dumps. A disconnected telephone receiver sits on a night table.
One day last week, Mr. Malave, who is 60 years old, lay lazily on an aluminum cabinet with a plastic-covered cushion under a wide umbrella. He comes here in summer from his daughter's house nearby and says he spends all of his time at the pier.
"This is beautiful," he said. "I could stay here forever." GARRY PIERRE-PIERRE

Decision Time For Empire Stores

BYLINE: By GARRY PIERRE-PIERRE 

 BODY:
After decades of grand plans gone awry, the latest scheme for revamping a cluster of nine state-owned warehouses on the Brooklyn waterfront is fast approaching a watershed. Last week, officials of the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation said they would choose a developer for the buildings, known collectively as the Empire Stores, next month.
The state agency wants to transform the ground floors of three of the buildings into a cultural and retail center that would house art galleries, artists' studios, boutiques, cafes and a theater. 
 Last year the department sought bids from developers to devise a plan for the 40,000 square feet of space in buildings 5, 6 and 7, on Water Street between New Dock and Main Streets. Two proposals were received, one from Urban Space Management, which consulted on the design of the Grand Central Terminal market and has created retail centers in England. The other bidder is Bridge Visions Inc., which designed the former Amazon Village restaurant and dance club on Pier 25 and the Amazon Club in Sag Harbor, L.I.
Joan K. Davidson, the commissioner of the state agency, would not comment on the cost of the Empire Stores project, but she said it was "at the very top of my priorities." Once a plan is approved, she said, she hopes to have the project completed by next summer.
Although community leaders and the waterfront's growing number of artists generally welcome the new proposal, they are skeptical. The stores, a beehive of commercial activity during the 19th and early 20th centuries, were closed after World War II, and various plans to develop them have come and -- when the financing failed to materialize -- gone. The 1991 version called for development of all nine of the warehouses at an estimated cost of $107 million.
The current plan is much more modest, but Allen Swerdlowe, president of the Fulton Ferry Association, a community group, said: "Anything incremental will have a positive effect on the waterfront. Over time we're going to understand more clearly the exact best use for the area."
Sharon Derechin Rozsay, a member of the Brooklyn Waterfront Artists Coalition, added, "I would love to see this happen. As an artist, if it just grew up around us, it would be wonderful." GARRY PIERRE-PIERRE

Two Rookie Owners Just Can't Stay Still

BYLINE: By Claire Smith

 BODY:
Rookie owners, like rookie players, must pay their dues before speaking out. This is one of the unwritten rules of the major league baseball jungle.
Peter Angelos of the Baltimore Orioles and Jerry McMorris of the Colorado Rockies think they have paid their dues. One hundred and seventy-three million of them in Angelos's case. And about $150 million in expansion fees and startup costs in the case of the ownership of the two-year-old Rockies, which McMorris heads up. 
 Now, because of a players strike and negotiations that often seem frozen in time, the two owners have watched their franchises pay even more, by way of lost gates and the lost faith of those who were flocking in record numbers to Camden Yards and Mile High Stadium this season. Which is why both Angelos and McMorris have tried in their own ways to cajole both sides into finding a way to make peace from the moment a players strike shut down the game on Aug. 12.
Angelos and McMorris haven't broken with other owners. They have suggested even-handed solutions to the age-old paradox that is labor negotiations in baseball. Such approaches can often be perilous. Just ask Fay Vincent, the last commissioner. He was deposed partially because he entered negotiations to end the 1990 lockout and prodded management to remove its ill-fated pay-for-performance proposal from the table in order to dislodge stalled talks.
Owners are no more encouraged to chart their own course than are commissioners. They are not even encouraged to speak for fear of undermining assertions of a united front. Only Bud Selig, the acting commissioner; and Richard Ravitch, the owners' chief negotiator, are to speak for management, it was announced even before the strike began.
Yet three owners did speak out on the eve of the strike. One was the Yankees' George Steinbrenner. The other two, surprisingly, were the new guys, Angelos and McMorris, and their alarm is akin to newlyweds of Hatfields and McCoys who only began to comprehend the depth of the animosity in the feud after the marriages were performed.
"The level of mistrust and the literal breach between ownership and the players and their union is far deeper than I ever did believe," said McMorris, a trucking magnate who has long dealt with unions such as the Teamsters. "It's a much bigger problem than I ever would have expected it to be."
The very idea that baseball and the players and their union continue to mix morality with finances almost three decades into their dealings is also astonishing to the Rockies' president, who says it occurs "more frequently in this industry than in any other industry that I've ever seen."
That is probably why veteran owners would wish the new guys wait to earn battle scars like theirs before professing to fully understand the war. Still, doesn't someone who spent, say, $173 million, to buy into the owners' club already have more than a vested interest? Especially when his investment dwarfs the initial investments of others who paid as little as $3 million for clubs? Or, especially when he has 173 million more dollars on the line than, say, the growing number of C.E.O.s who merely represent corporate-owned teams?
Angelos, in his first season as proprietor at Camden Yards, bought the Orioles for that mind-boggling $173 million even though he said he knew a work stoppage was possible. Still, when he saw that players were poised to walk out because of the owners' insistence on a salary cap, he suggested that the hot-button issue be tabled in exchange for the players vowing not to strike but, instead, play and negotiate.
"I felt that it needed to be said, in that one should invite the opposing side to negotiate, not just say, 'My way or the highway," Angelos said Friday. "As it was, both sides were hardened in their position. There was no place to go."
McMorris also called for conciliation on the cap issue, though insisting that a new way of doing business is crucial for baseball to restore balance in the game and assure "economic sanity."
Still, McMorris spoke out, in a fashion he said has been consistent with his beliefs since joining the game. "I think everybody in baseball has understood from the beginning that the Colorado Rockies want to play ball, as most of the teams want to play ball," he said. "But we're sitting in a very special situation here. We were on track to draw 4.7 million people, which would have meant we would have drawn over nine million people in our first two years. So we feel we had the most to lose by not playing ball."
Morris spoke about the special chemistry found between the players, the club and the fans who pour into Denver from over a dozen surrounding states. "I hate to see us messing with that," he said. Unending work stoppages do that, he believes.
"My sense is that the public thinks we're all spoiled," he said. "Fans are tired of the whining. And I don't see how this industry continues to do this at every labor negotiation and can't figure out that this thing could be even better for everybody than it is, now, if we could only get on the same page."
Both Angelos and McMorris hope that a map to that better day was starting to be drawn up Friday. That's when mediators not only unveiled plans to bring both sides back to the table Wednesday, but coaxed owners to attend, as well.
"It's another set of ears, another set of eyes, five or six additional intellects to try to help find a solution," McMorris said. "I'm hopeful that we can start making some progress."
Will Angelos and McMorris be among the owners who sit down with players? Angelos said Friday he has not been invited. McMorris, reputed to be in a second group of the teams of five being selected by Selig, refused to comment on the report.
But, as yet another owner said, there are guys out there who could make a difference. One would be hard put to find one with any more reason to do so, or interest in making a difference, than Peter Angelos or Jerry McMorris.

HEADLINE: Hotels See Benefits From Repeal of Tax

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER 

 BODY:
THE hated hotel tax is almost history. The Sept. 1 repeal of the 5 percent surcharge on New York State hotel rooms is making Westchester hotel people very happy.
"All of us in the industry are delighted," said Marcia Dmochowski, speaking about members of the Westchester County Hotel Association. "The repeal of the tax will make Westchester much more affordable for meeting planners." 
 Ms. Dmochowski, who is president of the hotel group and manager of the Tarrytown Hilton in Tarrytown, said that the four-year surcharge on hotel rooms, coming at the same time as the recession, made it very difficult for Westchester hotels and conference centers to compete with their rivals in New Jersey and Connecticut.
"Now that the playing field is even, we are all redoubling our marketing efforts to attract new business to Westchester," she said.
Indeed, the hotel managers' efforts will be aided by renovation and capital improvement programs designed to appeal to meeting planners. Such plans are under way at half a dozen hotels and conference centers.
At the Hudson River Inn and Conference Center in Ossining, Wes La Bay, one of the hotel's owners and its general manager, said that a $250,000 renovation program of the inn's meeting rooms and public spaces had been completed last year.
"And we have just finished a $50,000 renovation of Bayfields, our gourmet restaurant, in time to accommodate a three-day New York State Republican women's conference that was held here recently," he said. "We had about 100 guests staying with us, plus another 200 coming in for meals."
 
Business Reservations Up
 In addition to the refurbished 30 conference and meeting rooms, Mr. La Bay said the inn had recently installed a course designed for adventure training and team building programs. Moreover, he said, the inn's fall reservations from business groups are up "100 percent over the same period last year, with 50 percent of it coming from repeat clients and 50 percent from those who are new to us."
At Tarrytown House Conference House in Tarrytown, the sales and marketing director, Jeff Weggeman, said conference bookings at Tarrytown House were running unusually strong for the first quarter of 1995.
"That is a very good sign that perhaps the recession is behind us because normally January, February and March are very slow months," Mr. Weggeman said. "However, we have publicized the $4 million renovation program we have under way, which includes constructing an entire new kitchen and new ballroom space so we can increase the size and number of meetings and conferences and social events."
 
Renovation at Arrowwood
 And in Rye Brook, Doral Arrowwood, a resort conference center, began a multifaceted renovation program in June. John Wilderman, Doral's regional vice president and managing director, said that virtually all areas of the 272-room, 114-acre property, including conference rooms, banquet rooms, guest rooms and public spaces, are involved in the renovation. The first stage, costing more than $1.6 million, is expected to be completed by the beginning of next year.
"Keeping Arrowwood as up to date as possible has been a priority since we first opened," Mr. Wilderman said. And for conference guests, he continued, Arrowwood's 120-seat amphitheater will be upgraded and refurbished with extensive improvements in lighting, sound and audiovisual equipment.
 
A More Even Footing
 Teleconference capability has increased with the installation of satellite video-conferencing equipment in conjunction with interactive conference networks. By way of satellite, corporate groups can interact with others at more than 60 network sites.
Kristin Garbarini, director of sales and marketing at Arrowwood, said: "About 80 percent of our overall business is generated from conferences. Repeat business is strong. What frequently happens with companies is that we get exposure by hosting a meeting for senior management people who in turn will then book us to hold conferences for their entire departments or divisions."
The repeal of the hotel tax, Ms. Garbarini emphasized, will certainly make Doral Arrowwood more competitive. "It will put us on an even footing with other glamor conference centers such as Hamilton Park in New Jersey and similar upscale centers in Florida and Arizona."
What hotel people find especially attractive about conference business is that it guarantees that blocks of rooms are sold. "An empty hotel room represents a loss that can never be regained," Ms. Dmochowski said, adding that in order to gain more conference business for the Tarrytown Hilton, the hotel has taken what was formerly the Pennybridge Restaurant and transformed it into a conference-banquet dining room.
"It is really a more efficient, better use of space," she said. "We are able to use it for multipurpose events. For instance, we can convert it from conference use during the week to a banquet room for weddings or Sunday brunch on the weekends."
She added, however, that two new restaurants -- Da Vinci's, featuring Mediterranean cuisine, and Sports Edition, an informal restaurant -- have been opened. "Both are popular with hotel guests, the majority of whom are business travelers."
At the Rye Town Hilton in Rye Brook, the general manager, Ernest H. Rechtermann, said that some guest rooms at the Rye Town Hilton have been converted into six new conference rooms. "We needed additional conference rooms to keep us competitive because small meeting spaces are very much in demand," Mr. Rechterman said.
A surge in one-day meetings for small groups is also taking place at Stouffer Westchester Hotel in White Plains, reported Elie G. Zod, director of operations. "We are anticipating an increase in two- or three-day meetings from clients who blamed the hotel tax as a reason not to hold their meetings in Westchester."
Because accommodations for group activities are currently deemed important by meeting planners, Mr. Zod continued, "we recently installed a regulation volley ball and a boccie court, and both are very popular with not only corporate guests but our leisure guests, too."

HEADLINE: ULTRAMARATHON;
A Run to Moonlight For Food and More

BYLINE: By ALEX MARKELS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LEADVILLE, Colo., Aug. 20

 BODY:
To Manuel Luna Guitierez, there's only one good reason to run a 100-mile race. "I run for my pueblo," said the wiry, 31-year old Tarahumara Indian, a native of northwest Mexico's Copper Canyon. "I run for the food we will win."
But to most of the nearly 300 other runners in today's Leadville Race to the Sky, the motivation for undertaking one of the world's most grueling foot races is less pragmatic. Most ultrarunners are American engineers, nurses, business consultants and the like in their 30's, 40's and even 50's. And though a few top runners have corporate sponsors, the lack of prize money insures that most competitors are strictly amateurs. 
 "They're just looking for another dragon to slay," said Ken Chlouber, the race organizer who is also a runner. "Money isn't what it's all about. In fact, I don't think you could pay people to endure the discomfort, pain and sickness a race like this takes."
 
Through Passes and Streams
 At 4 A.M. this morning, Guitierez, Chlouber and the rest of the field lined up at the starting line 10,000 feet above sea level. The course would twice take them over Hope Pass (elevation: 12,600 feet), across icy streams and treacherous boulder-strewn slopes. The first of the runners will finish by moonlight around midnight.
Guitierez and six other Tarahumara came from Mexico at the behest of Rick Fisher, who has gathered runners from three Tarahumara villages, promising the winner's village one ton of corn and a half-ton of beans.
Fisher, an outdoor guide and amateur anthropologist who has led trips into Copper Canyon for 15 years, hopes to inspire Guitierez and his 40,000 brethren to revive their ages-old running-race tradition.
Called Ralajipame, it is a team-based endurance contest played with a wooden ball that's kicked around a course until the losing team gives up from exhaustion. The races often last days and can cover 100 miles or more. Wagering up to a quarter of each village's collective wealth, the competition begins with an intense gambling fest that can last almost as long as the race itself.
"It's more than a game to them," said John Kennedy, a retired anthropology professor from Santa Fe, N.M. "It's obviously a pleasant diversion, but it's also an economic activity, a force for social cohesion and a channel for aggression. If it were removed from Tarahumara life, the effect would be greater than if some sporting activity were dropped from our own culture." (Like, say, baseball?)
The Tarahumara, agrarian peasants who live in the deep canyons and pine-covered plateaus of Mexico's 35,000-square-mile Sierra de Tarahumara wilderness, always ran because they needed to: traveling great distances to herd goats and coax corn and beans from the rocky, unproductive soil. Now they spend their lives on the run, between the canyon rim and its tropical floor 6,000 feet below, where they winter.
With a high-carbohydrate, low-fat vegetarian diet, the svelte Tarahumara are perfectly adapted for running. Early American explorers noted their remarkable endurance in carrying supplies and mail, and Tarahumara athletes have twice raced in Olympic marathons (Amsterdam, 1928, and Mexico City, 1968), although culture shock left them far back.
But with increased road building and logging in the region, many younger Tarahumara have abandoned their running legacy, opting instead to hitch rides on passing trucks. Over the last decade, running challenges have dwindled from an intense competition between 40 villages to occasional races among only a few.
 
Willing Participants
 Wary of being perceived as a huckster but desperate to preserve the tribe's traditions, Fisher says he has brought the Tarahumara to Leadville the past three years for one reason only: because they wanted to come.
"People are always trying to sell them on something," Fisher said, "but almost nobody has gone onto Indian land and looked at what the Indians were interested in. These people call themselves the Raramuri, the 'foot racers.' I could work to build a hospital or a school, but the people I work with don't want those things."
More interested in Tarahumara culture than in ultrarunning, Fisher's first foray into coaching proved disastrous. In their first Leadville 100 in 1992, not one Indian finished. Accustomed to running in their huarache sandals homemade from old tires and leather, the runners' feet understandably swelled in the Converse Chuck Taylor high-top sneakers Fisher had supplied them. And like the torches they carry at night at home, they held the flashlights provided for the Leadville race facing skyward.
But their ultimate undoing may have been their appreciation of the world around them. Thirty miles into the race, Chlouber came across the Tarahumara sitting at the edge of the trail admiring the view.
"I was trotting along and I saw two of them sitting on their haunches looking at the valley," he said. "I thought to myself, 'They're a lot smarter than I am.' "
 
How to Win
 When three Tarahumara returned last year, Fisher brought them to a Leadville junkyard where they made new huaraches from abandoned tires. Before the race, he also explained to them that unlike their competitions, where they may only accept food and water from their own villagers, they should take sustenance from race volunteers along the course.
They started the race at the back of the pack, trotting along in near effortless Ever-ready battery bunny steps. But as more than half the field gave way to exhaustion, the three Tarahumara slowly made their way to the front. By the 80th mile, the first Tarahumara, 55-year-old Victoriano Churro, took the lead. He and his comrades finished first, second and fifth, with Churro finishing 40 minutes ahead of the nearest competitor.
"It was amazing," said Harry Dupre, 56, of Mustang, Okla., who has run the Leadville race 12 times. "They seemed to move with the ground. Kind of like a cloud or a fog moving across the mountains. Here were these little guys wearing sandals, who never actually trained for the race. And they blew away some of the best long-distance runners in the world."
When they came to accept their winning trophy, however, they appeared miffed. "I think they were looking for something a little more utilitarian than a pan full of fool's gold," said Chlouber sheepishly, "although one did say he thought the pan would be good for eating out of."
For today's race, Fisher made sure the Tarahumara's would have plenty of incentive. In addition to offering the winner a four-month supply of grain, he also arranged for a grant from Rockport, which paid for travel costs and supplied the Tarahumara with high-tech cross-training shoes.
"They're good," said Guitierez as he unstitched the shoes to reveal deeply callused feet. "But I will use my huaraches. They bring me good luck."
Said Chlouber: "Kind of makes me wonder whether I should throw out those hundred dollar running shoes of mine."

HEADLINE: Banks Revise Credit Access For Low-Income Borrowers

BYLINE: By JUDY GLASS 

 BODY:
LONG ISLAND banks have been developing policies, products and business partnerships intended to increase the accessiblity of credit for low- and moderate-income communities.
But some critics contend that the money is not enough and is not reaching those requesting it. 
 Bankers say their increased interest does not stem just from Federal and state proposals to expand the powers of the Federal Community Reinvestment Act. The law obligates banks to work with low- and moderate-income communities and individuals in exchange for special privileges.
The Federal law, enacted in 1977, was intended to eliminate "redlining," or excluding, poor or minority-group areas and denying loans even to depositors.
On Long Island, where the median income for a family of four is $63,100, according to the Census, moderate income at 50 to 80 percent of the median is $31,000 to $51,040. Low income is below $31,000.
Most Census tracts on the Island are middle income, from $51,040 to $63,100, or 80 to 100 percent of the median.
To be eligible for credit under the reinvestment act, housing or business developments have to be in low- or moderate-income tracts. Individuals may buy property anywhere.
The European American Bank has begun a $20 million Neighborhood Mortgage Program and a small-business lending program in Roosevelt. The president of the bank, Edward Travaglianti, said such programs were not established solely to impress regulators. The investments make long-term sense for Long Island, Mr. Travaglianti said, adding:
"The appropriate thing to do is to give opportunities to hard-working dedicated people who want to make their lives better. And it is the responsibility of banks to provide those funds."
EAB has also committed $2 million to the Long Island Housing Partnership, which was founded in 1988 to build housing. The partnership, which has built 213 houses, has expanded its membership and programs to include most banks on the Island and many business organizations.
Banks contribute 7 percent of the money for partnership developments, which the Federal and state governments also subsidize.
"When we first started we had trouble getting banks interested in our projects," the president of the partnership, Jim Morgo, said. "Just when we're gaining momentum the recent raising of interest rates by the Federal Reserve is threatening to hurt those families the partnership attempts to help."
The organization has built 15 houses in Long Beach, at $70,371 each, with construction loans and mortgages from EAB; 72 units at $58,584 in Amity Villas in North Amityville, with construction and loans primarily from the Roosevelt Savings Bank, and 53 houses in Central Islip.
Under construction are the first East End program, with 30 houses starting at $83,590, in East Quogue; 42 houses on scattered sites in Brentwood and North Bellport, and 33 condominiums in Middle Island.
"The law was most effective in the 1970's and 80's, when banks were monitored for compliance," said Barbara Mack, assistant director of the Suffolk County Community Development Agency, which administers Federal housing money designated for blighted neighborhoods.
After the savings-and-loan bailout in 1990, the Community Reinvestment Act law was weakened, and banks concentrated on "process," rather than investment, Ms. Mack said.
"C.R.A. is a hot topic on Long Island now, because of the Clinton Administration's desire to see it revamped with less paperwork," said Catherine Mullarkey, a vice president of EAB.
Fleet Bank now has an $8 billion Incity program, and the Chase Community Development Corporation has a $200 million program, both focusing primarily on metropolitan areas.
"Long Island's needs are just as great," said Mr. Margo.
"There are now 1,500 applicants to the Suffolk County Community Development Agency," said Ms. Mack.
Ms. Mack said banks paid "more lip service than financial service to their C.R.A. obligations, with the exception of EAB." The county, she added, depends on banks to provide mortgages for recipients in housing and urban-development programs.
"These recipients historically have a lower default rate than conventional borrowers," Ms. Mack said. "The banks get C.R.A. brownie points for doing paperwork, joining nonprofit housing organizations, running seminars and listening attentively. But we need them to make the loans."
She said she agreed with a former State Banking Superintendent, Derrick D. Cephas, that the Community Reinvestment Act was far too subjective. "Banks shop regulators to get maximum C.R.A. credit," Ms. Mack said.
The director of housing and intergovernmental affairs in Nassau, Don Campbell, said: "C.R.A. officers are not beating our doors down to do projects. But we don't have many problems with financing, because we provide most of the resources. Some C.R.A. bank officers are window dressing, because they are not authorized to write loans."
 
"I Certainly Did Not Discriminate'
 The community development officer at Fleet, Crosby Donald, defended the banks, saying: "As a minority branch manager since 1963, I can tell you that Long Island banks have made tremendous progress since the law was enacted. I certainly did not discriminate against qualified individuals who met the policies of the bank even before the law. But for years banks did not have the products to serve low- to-moderate-income applicants that they have now."
In the last few years, Mr. Donald said, banks have been developing products like mortgages that require 5 percent down payments or no down payments. The banks are also more flexible in evaluating debt-to-income ratios, an alternative way to gauge credit risk.
Most banks offer counseling to applicants to insure that they understand the commitments and can afford them. The banks, Mr. Donald said, have been willing to keep the mortgages in their portfolios, because they usually do not meet the criteria for the secondary market.
"Home ownership gives people self-esteem, pride in their community and incentives to work that they don't get as renters," Mr. Donald said. "If a family is paying $900 to rent and we can help them to buy, it's better for Long Island, too. It would be a disservice to push these mortgages to people who might foreclose. The banks don't want to own homes."
Some banks help family members who would live together to pool resources and co-sign the mortgage commitment.
Shirley Cobb, a single mother who has moved into in a three-bedroom ranch in Medford, pays $700 a month for principal, interest and taxes on her new $79,000 house, compared with the $850 that she paid in monthly rent for a two-bedroom apartment in Happauge.
 
State Grants of $5,000
 Miss Cobb obtained a Sonyma mortgage under a state program for first-time homebuyers when interest rates were at 6 percent. "I could not have done it without the Down Payment Assistance Program of the Suffolk County Community Development Agency, which gave me the down payment of $4,800," she said.
That program provides up to $5,000 for low- to moderate-income first-time buyers whose new houses are in one of the 15 municipalities in the agency's consortium.
"I tried and I tried, but all of the banks I went to steered me away," said Miss Cobb, who earns $28,000 a year as an occupational therapist at the Kings Park Psychiatric Center and from an additional part-time job.
"I read a lot," she said, "and applied for every special program I saw advertised. I must have seen 100 houses in one year. I was accepted for one of the Long Island Housing Partnership's subsidized homes, as well as the Farmers' Home Administration Program, which subsidizes the mortgage by 75 percent.
"But I rejected those two, because I wasn't satisfied with the areas the Long Island Housing Partnership was offering, and the farmers' program, which has a very lengthy application process, would subsidize purchase only on a house in their inventory. Also you have to pay back the subsidy at the end of the 30-year mortgage or whenever you sell."
When she began applying for mortgages, "the banks were not at all helpful," Miss Cobb recounted, adding: "Their ads were like a fallacy that they wanted to help. If you don't make $50,000 a year they won't work with you. I had to come up with another $8,000 in closing costs and I couldn't get the mortgage until the house, which was vacant, was fully repaired."
Miss Cobb hired an engineer to inspect the house, which she said she believed that an investor owned, and the seller was required to make repairs before the mortgage was approved. The repairs included a new kitchen, new windows and new boiler, "everything but the paint," she said.
The pastor of the First Baptist Church in Wyandanch, Michael Talbert, credited Leo Toca of the Chase Manhattan Bank for helping him buy a house in Wyandanch with 95 percent financing and no points.
In addition to mortgages for people who qualify, Long Island banks are offering home-improvement loans on new and existing houses to low- and moderate-income owners.
 
Subsidies for 3% Interest
 In some programs, deferred loans do not have to be repaid until the house is sold, and subsidies could lower the interest rate to 3 or 6 percent.
EAB signed an agreement in May to provide $250,000 in improvement loans to homeowners in the Town of North Hempstead, which is revitalizing New Cassel, and $200,000 to residents of New Cassel.
A Chase subsidiary, the Chase Community Development Corporation, is lending $10.3 million to build the Landmark Project in Port Washington. That conversion of the Main Street School into apartments for the elderly has taken two years.
The president of the Chase unit, Mark Willis, said he objected to state proposals to revise the criteria for community reinvestment. "The time and effort put into one $50,000 loan that would not otherwise have happened is more important than 10 loans that are easy and any bank would do," Mr. Willis said.
 
For Rough Area in Wyandanch
 In another community-improvement effort, to help Wyandanch "restore, revitalize and recapture" a shopping center that had become a center for drugs and prostitution, Chemical Bank has given $15,000 to Wyandanch Entrepreneurial Development Inc., which was established a year ago to be the landlord of the seven-store center.
"The plan is for the Town of Babylon to condemn the site and for us to acquire it and restore it before turning it over to W.E.D. Inc." said Bill Klatsky, director of the Suffolk Community Development Corporation, the largest administrator of Section 8 programs for the town.
The board of the development agency, led by Daria Cooper, a Citibank employee who is on a leave of absence to administer the project, is interviewing prospective tenants.
EAB, with the Roosevelt Chamber of Commerce, is planning to aid businesses that would not ordinarily qualify for loans, Ms. Mullarkey said. Bank representatives and chamber members will examine applicants, and the bank has agreed to accept the chamber's recommendations.
"You're either too small or too big to qualify for most banks' business loans," said Jonathan Warren, owner of the Roosevelt Check Cashing Center, the first business participating in an alliance between EAB and the chamber.
EAB has set aside $100,000 to assist small and minority-owned businesses in low- to moderate-income communities.
Mr. Warren has a $20,000 loan, repayable in five years, that helped him extend his business's hours. The Carver Savings Bank is the sole bank in Roosevelt, and, Mr. Warren said, "many residents don't have the amount required to keep on deposit."
Mr. Warren said that 30 percent of his customers were elderly people who did not have transportation and that many people depended on him to honor their Nassau County benefits cards, which replaced checks in 1992.
Mr. Warren, who has paid off personal loans since going into business eight years ago, laughed at the idea that banks wanted to help small minority-owned businesses to expand.
"When you apply," he said, "it's a whole different ball game. The rules and regulations are so rigid. They said we couldn't qualify, even though we have shown a profit every year, have paid back our other loans and offered our building for collateral."
There will be "no problem" repaying the EAB loan, Mr. Warren said. The business meets state standards, is audited annually and has shown small profits every year, he noted.
Mayra Fuentes-Jimenez, owner of Dream World Travel in a shopping center in Wheatley Heights, credits the Minority Business Development Center in Melville with obtaining approval for a seven-year $100,000 loan that Chemical Bank gave the agency last year.
 
Embezzlement While Planning
 In business for 18 years, Dream World incurred major losses from embezzling in 1989 about the time that the owners were planning to renovate the rented office and buy new computers for the four employees, Ms. Fuentes-Jimenez said, adding: "Rejected for a few loans, we were afraid we wouldn't survive, until the National Minority Business Development Center helped us to put together a package for a Small Business Administration loan that was acceptable to the bank. When bank executives physically came to the office from Manhattan we finally believed we'd go someplace with this."
A spokeswoman for the State Banking Department, Clare E. Sykes, said there had not been much pressure on banks to show activity under the reinvestment act, unless they applied to expand. Under the law, she said, the banks have to include poorer areas for lending. Individual examiners decide the level of compliance.
Large banks have to include all the low- to moderate-income Census tracts on Long Island in their community-service areas. Small banks may not include any, "but also may not be penalized if they never apply for expansion," Ms. Sykes said.

HEADLINE: Hotel's Fate Poses a Preservation Test

BYLINE: By JOYCE JONES 

DATELINE: CAPE MAY

 BODY:
FOR those approaching Cape May by sea, the Christian Admiral Hotel vies with the Cape May Lighthouse as the first sighting of land in the state's southernmost coastal city.
As might be expected in this Victorian city with its national historic landmark status, when the lighthouse needed restoration, Cape May rallied in 1990 to refurbish the 165-foot brick structure, built in 1859. The work was completed in 1994 to the satisfaction of all concerned. But the eight-story brick Beaux-Arts Christian Admiral Hotel, built in 1908, may not have as happy an ending. 
 Its fate is in the hands of two groups: Federal Bankruptcy Court and the Resolution Trust Corporation on the one hand, and the Lojis Corporation, a developer from Everett, Wash., on the other.
Lojis must first decide if the building is salvageable, something that 80 previous potential buyers doubted. Lojis, however, recently saved the Monte Cristo Hotel in Everett, similar in size to the Christian Admiral but in far worse condition, company officials say.
"This country has many wonderful old buildings that may become an embarrassment to the community, like the Christian Admiral," said David Mandley, president of Lojis. "The dilemma facing Cape May is a recurring one: finding alternative uses for old historic buildings, which may also stretch the limits of how far preservationists will go."
The plight of historic buildings fits a pattern, said Elan Zingman-Leith, a former deputy of the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission, who owns a bed-and-breakfast inn here and is the consultant to the Cape May Historic Preservation Commission. "In cases like this when it comes to preserving a big old building, the players often turn out to be the same," he said.
Mr. Zingman-Leith outlined the usual questions raised: Has the owner maintained the building? Is the city cooperative enough in its regulation and taxing policy? Will a nonprofit group get enough return to take care of the building? What effect do the state and different regulatory agencies have on the operation of the building in terms of fire and safety?
At the turn of the century, the Christian Admiral was known as the Hotel Cape May, built to reflect opulence. Today, its huge lobby with faux marbre columns continues to be illuminated by the light coming through the dome's stained glass ceiling, while underfoot is a hand-laid mosaic marble floor. Chairs in the Chippendale style surround large round tables in the dining room, with its sweeping views of the sea.
But no one can check in here, even though all 330 rooms are unoccupied. A sign on the loading dock in the back of the hotel tells the story: This building is condemned.
The hotel's terra-cotta tile roof has been extensively damaged by winds, allowing rain to percolate through the upper floors and damage the walls. Even the steel beams have begun to corrode inside the masonry.
In 1990, the owner of the hotel, the Christian Beacon Press, a religious group headed by a the Rev. Dr. Carl McIntire, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Included in the debt of $3.5 million are municipal charges that add up to $500,000 and a $2.4 million mortgage held by the Resolution Trust Corporation on two properties, the Christian Admiral and a 100-room hotel, Congress Hall.
The bankruptcy judge set Dec. 31, 1993, as the date for payment to all creditors. If the debt was not paid, auction of both hotels was to have begun on April 1 of this year. The receipt of a demolition permit was used to show a good-faith intent to sell the underlying land and raise the money, so the auction was halted.
The Christian Admiral building itself is valued at just $120,000, though the seven acres on which it sits are worth an estimated $5 million. If the building were razed and the property subdivided into single-family lots, estimates are that more than $5 million could be raised to satisfy the creditors.
The Christian Beacon Press has established that any money remaining after settling the debts would go to refurbish historic Congress Hall, where five Presidents of the United States have spent summers.
Last November, as the December deadline neared with no buyer in sight, the Christian Beacon Press applied to the city and was granted a demolition permit for the Christian Admiral.
Curtis Bashaw, a grandson of Dr. McIntire, serves as a consultant to the Christian Beacon Press and is a local hotelier. Mr. Bashaw, who showed the property to the 80 potential purchasers, concluded that no commercial developer wanted to buy it.
"The demolition permit," he said, "was like an insurance policy for all the creditors. The bankruptcy court and the Resolution Trust Corporation have been very generous to us with their stays."
 
Spirit of Preservation
 But in a community that prides itself on preservation, where the last demolition occurred 20 years ago, tearing down an old building borders on heresy.
Both Mr. Bashaw and another grandson of Dr. McIntire, Norris Clark, who serves as vice president of the three-member board that control the Christian Beacon Press, resent being cast as the villains who want the hotel torn down.
Sitting on the veranda of the Virginia Hotel, a stately Victorian building, once in shambles, that Mr. Bashaw bought in 1988 and restored, he said: "People wear the mantle of preservationists, and that may not always be tractable. To save the Christian Admiral, a coalition of preservationists has got to roll up its sleeves and jump-start the project."
What is needed is to find an adaptive re-use of the building and meet Federal, state and city building codes in the refurbishing, Mr. Bashaw said.
He said that to make the Christian Admiral more attractive to potential developers, there has to be some trade-off, which the community, to date, has not seen fit to make. "Their approach borders on sitting around and wishing for a savior to come," he said.
While the City of Cape May opposes tearing down the hotel, the residents do not want to subsidize the building or forgive some of the back taxes, Mr. Bashaw said.
"The state has mandates," he said. "The hotel's roof was badly in need of repair, but we had to put in fire safety improvements like a sprinkler system and smoke alarms at a cost of $800,000, money that could have been used to fix the roof.
"People want to save these old buildings that must be brought up to code. You have to comply with other mandates like the Americans With Disabilities Act. To rid the building of asbestos alone could cost as much as $750,000."
 
Community Support Sought
 Searching for community support, Mr. Bashaw approached the Mid-Atlantic Center for the Arts, a nonprofit organization based in Cape May that specializes in historic preservation. He said he had been told that the group would assist in any way it could but that saving the Christian Admiral was a project too grand in scale for it.
In the efforts to restore the Cape May Lighthouse, the money raised was in the thousands of dollars, about $750,000, Mr. Bashaw said; the Christian Admiral restoration requires millions.
Larry Muentz was chairman of the Historic Preservation Commission hearing on the demolition application, which the commission denied, but which was later granted by the Planning Board. "The problem," Mr. Muentz said, "is not fixing the stones and mortar; it's finding an adaptive commercial use for the building. It's all in the economics. You're looking for answers to: 'Who is going to pay for it? Who is going to run it?' "
Once a demolition permit has been granted, a Cape May ordinance requires a six-month waiting period in a last-ditch effort for a possible buyer. That appeared to have happened in January, when R. Steven Scherfel, president of the Senior Living Centers in Cherry Hill, came forward with a proposal to transform the Christian Admiral into the Breakers at Cape May, a continuing-care retirement community with apartment accommodations.
Mr. Scherfel agreed to the asking price of $3.5 million. But he withdrew his offer when the Resolution Trust Corporation said a 5 percent cash deposit was required, about $175,000.
The decision was a blow to Cape May's Mayor, Robert Elwell, who is eager to have the building back on the tax rolls. "This is a very valuable piece of property," he said. "But I am enough of a realist that if someone doesn't come forward soon, the building is going to fall down anyway. But we have to give it every last breath we can."
Mr. Mandley, the Lojis president, said his company had saved the Monte Cristo by "using housing tax credits combined with national historic tax credit." He said in that case, the upper floors were rented as affordable housing, "while public spaces are on the lower floors."
"Low-income housing terrifies some people," he continued. "What they fail to realize that it provides affordable living quarters for the elderly and those who are just starting out."
Mr. Mandley has sent an engineer to check on the structural condition of the Christian Admiral. "Foremost in our mind," he said, "is making the numbers work so that the banks will invest in the project."
Mr. Bashaw, who is meeting with the Lojis people, likens the company's proposal to a "missing link" in finding an adaptable use for the hotel. He said, "The lower floors could be used as public space to accommodate Cape May's cultural projects like the art and musical festivals, and my grandfather's group could continue to hold their religious services there."
Mr. Clark joins his cousin, Mr. Bashaw, in continuing to explore opportunities to save the hotel. Mr. Clark said his ambition has been to establish a Cape May institute, patterned after the Aspen Institute in Colorado, at the Christian Admiral.
"I spent summers at the Christian Admiral doing every job from bellhop to baker," Mr. Clark said. "I'll see this through to the end. I just can't turn my back on it."

The Odd Pull Of 'Jeopardy' On 62 Flutes

BYLINE: By Michael Beckerman; Michael Beckerman teaches music history at the University of California, Santa Barbara.

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO

 BODY:
WE ARE IN A HUGE, MILDEWED AUDITOrium with a decrepit ceiling missing several panels. The hard wooden seats are filled except for the dozens of broken ones; thousands of proud parents and friends chatter in two dozen languages. The tune "Long, Long Ago" emanates from the front, behind a stained green curtain. Though it sounds for all the world like some gigantic exotic instrument or the auditory equivalent of root canal, it is something more: it is the sound of the future. Two hundred tiny fiddlers are getting ready for the first half of the Elementary Music Festival at Lincoln High School Auditorium, a concert featuring the finest beginning musicians of the San Francisco Unified School District.
The disrepair in the hall is symbolic: the school district has fallen on hard times, as California continues to reel under inexorable recession. Many schools are in trouble. There is little money for new technology, special subjects or new staff. Some schools don't even have basketball rims (although in fairness, the absence of rims may have more to do with discouraging gang activity in certain areas after school). There are 10,350 students taking music lessons in the district and only 13 music teachers. Each is responsible for five or more schools, and they ride the circuit like judges of yore. Simple arithmetic says that each teacher sees about 800 students per week. 
 Yet despite all obstacles, the level of instruction is high. In addition to support from the school district, the music program relies on generous grants from the Ewald Foundation, which provides instruments for the many students who cannot afford them, and sponsors the festival this afternoon. A few hundred award-winning students have been invited to attend.
Sally Ann Ryan, the program administrator for the visual and performing arts, thanks the parents for their patience and support. The curtain opens for the first act: the little fiddlers. Of those 10,000-plus taking music lessons, more than 1,200 are violinists. Some of the 200 selected for the festival are clad in white chiffon or blue gossamer, suspenders and polka-dot ties; others sport black jeans and white shirts. They are almost all Americans, though their parents come from dozens of countries and may speak Tagalog, Vietnamese, Cambodian, Spanish, Arabic, Chinese or Japanese. They perform on fiddles of all sizes and look very serious as they play their warm-up, "Long, Long Ago," followed by a tune called "Popcorn Party."
Calling off the names and numbers of the instruments that follow rings like some fractured Christmas carol or an inner city "Music Man": 38 trumpets blare "Lightly Row"; 72 clarinets honk out "Yankee Doodle" and "British Melody" (formerly "Aura Lee"); 62 flutes toot Beethoven's "Ode to Joy" and the theme from "Jeopardy." The culmination of this part comes when the three groups play a round, "Oh, How Lovely Is the Evening," and somehow manage to finish at the same time, to the delight of all present and the palpable relief of all the teachers. Twenty soprano recorders pipe "Go Tell Aunt Rhody" and "Loch Lomond," and a choir 42 strong shouts out "Getting to Know You," "Music Alone Shall Live" and "Open the Window, Noah."
These public images of beautiful children and musical beginnings lie somewhere on the plane between multiculturalism and elitism. Despite the range of languages and cultures represented, the music is vintage white America ("Long, Long Ago," "Go Tell Aunt Rhody"), as if all music education texts had mysteriously stopped in 1958. Although violin lessons may represent an entree to the world of high culture, the tune that generates the most excitement is the theme from "Jeopardy," which seems to cut across all cultural barriers -- a slightly scary thought.
The week after the concert, an unrelated newspaper article presents the complaints of childless workers who resent the time taken off by parents for child-rearing tasks; they demand equity in the workplace. Such a view seems to represent a curious lapse in reasoning. Who do they think will bring them their bedpans in 30 years if not some of these young performers? Who will serenade them with sweet sounds in their final days if they are lucky enough to end up in a retirement home -- or find cures for the diseases that torment them? Yet these young musicians and their friends receive only tiny bits of support from a society that will be quick to vilify and incarcerate them if they falter.
The San Francisco Unified School District has a commitment to multicultural education that can sometimes be divisive, since not all minority groups are equally privileged, but these children playing in their ensembles surely grasp the larger truth. The celebration of diversity needs to go far deeper, to its ultimate core, and acknowledge that each human being is a separate culture, with a unique view, a separate language and a separate reality. If we really love music and hope for a future in which it can flourish, our heroes should be the school music teachers who are fighting our fight on the front lines by teaching these children to celebrate their separate identities by performing together.

SELF-INFLICTED WOUNDS
From LBJ's Guns and Butter
to Reagan's Voodoo Economics.
By Hobart Rowen.
Illustrated. 447 pp. New York:
Times Books/Random House. $25. 
 HOBART ROWEN, the Washington Post columnist, is the dean of America's economic journalists. When the Federal Reserve Board boosts interest rates or finance ministers prop up the dollar or the International Monetary Fund imposes an austerity program on some bankrupt developing country, Mr. Rowen is usually the first (and most influential) newspaper writer to pass judgment.
"Self-Inflicted Wounds" is a book-length judgment on 30 years' worth of such decisions, ending more or less before the election of Bill Clinton. The verdict is not pretty. Mr. Rowen believes that the story of the United States economy over the last three decades is one of uninterrupted drift and decline. The roots of that decline are clear to him: "mismanagement, stupidity and irresponsibility by officials whose chief obligation to govern the nation was betrayed by their embrace of policies misconceived and ineptly applied."
Unfortunately, "Self-Inflicted Wounds" is as flawed as the economic policies it attacks. For one thing, it's dull -- or at least duller than necessary. There aren't many writers who can transform an analysis of exchange rates, wage and price guidelines and monetary reform into a page turner. But Mr. Rowen might have provided some relief by mining his notebooks for more color and texture. After all, he has had close encounters with globe-trotting characters from Treasury Secretary John Connally to Chancellor Helmut Schmidt of West Germany. It would be nice to see more of them in private moments.
Instead, we get just the slightest hint of what might have been. Mr. Rowen paints a sympathetic portrait of Jimmy Carter's first Treasury Secretary, Michael Blumenthal, whose clout, the author says, was undermined by narrow-minded political operatives. He recounts his 15-year grievance with Katharine Graham, the former publisher of The Washington Post, who Mr. Rowen feels did not defend him vigorously enough in the mid-1970's from attacks by Robert McNamara. (Mr. McNamara was upset by a series of articles Mr. Rowen had written criticizing his policies as president of the World Bank.)
It was only a few years ago, when Mrs. Graham interviewed Mr. Rowen for her book, that he cleared the air. "Kay had forgotten about the McNamara affair," he reports in a lengthy footnote. "But until our conversation in 1991, I had not been able to let go of my resentment." Regrettably, these flesh-and-blood moments are all too rare.
The more serious problem with Mr. Rowen's book involves substance rather than style. "Self-Inflicted Wounds" doesn't advance a sustained argument about what has gone wrong over the last 30 years. Instead, it offers critical judgments on specific economic decisions in six Administrations. Many of those decisions were big news when they were being debated; today, however, most of them seem remote, almost quaint.
Indeed, reading this book is a bit like leafing through a photo album. It revives memories: Did Gerald Ford really campaign to "whip inflation now"? Did Dad really wear that lime green leisure suit? But with a few exceptions, such as its justified, if unsurprising, attack on Reagan-era budget deficits, the book does not genuinely explain how these past decisions have shaped who and where we are today.
An example is Mr. Rowen's discussion of wage and price controls in the Nixon Administration -- specifically, the January 1973 decision to lift controls 18 months after they were imposed. "In retrospect," he writes, "dropping Phase II [price controls] was a monumental blunder. . . . There were indeed some distortions, as in the lumber industry. But the Administration never proved the general case. Phase II should have been left in place: it wasn't broke, and didn't need fixing."
PERHAPS. But it is awfully hard to detect the long-term implications of Richard Nixon's decision. In fact, just a few chapters later, Mr. Rowen blasts President Ford's obsession with inflation. By 1975, he argues, "the real enemy" was "a deepening recession," not runaway prices.
To Mr. Rowen, it seems from this book, making economic policy is like adjusting the dials on a stereo system: a little more bass on monetary policy, a little less treble on tax cuts, and the United States economy will make sweet music. The trouble, as he sees it, is that for 30 years the people turning the knobs have been tone-deaf.
But his reporting in "Self-Inflicted Wounds" creates an altogether different impression. It's not that Washington is messing up the dials. It's that the dials have been disconnected from the real economy, and no one has noticed. The issue is less stupidity than futility -- the declining
effectiveness of traditional policy tools in the face of fundamental economic changes: revolutionary technologies, aggressive global competitors, exotic new financial instruments. The real problem is not what Washington has been doing, but what it has been missing.
The same can be said of "Self-Inflicted Wounds." Mr. Rowen's exhaustive analysis of America's economic predicament ignores the most powerful forces transforming the economy -- forces whose significance has finally begun to penetrate the Washington agenda. Consider just three: the computer revolution, the telecommunications revolution and health care.
Mr. Rowen writes at great length on the rise and fall of OPEC's hold over oil, the essential raw material of the industrial age. But what about the rise of the microprocessor, the essential raw material of the computer age? Information technology has changed how companies are structured, how people work, what they get paid. No serious discussion of unemployment and income inequality can ignore the economic and social impact of computers.
He chronicles the breakup of the Bretton Woods monetary system under President Nixon. But what about the breakup of the Bell System under Ronald Reagan? It may be the most important (if unintended) industrial policy ever devised. Competition among AT&T, the Baby Bells, MCI, Sprint and hundreds of other post-breakup companies has created the technological innovations behind the information highway. No serious discussion of the competitive battle between the United States and Japan can ignore our commanding lead in the most important industry of the future.
Similarly, he devotes an entire chapter to the third world debt crisis. But what about the health care crisis? For 20 years, health care has been a growing sector of the economy, a huge competitive burden and a big drain on the Federal budget. No serious discussion of inflation and the deficit can ignore health care.
Mr. Rowen ignores these and other critical developments because for too long our political leaders ignored them as well. Washington's negligence may be the ultimate self-inflicted wound.
 
 
 
WINNING ONE WAR, LOSING ANOTHER
 In my years of reporting on the economic scene in Washington and from foreign capitals, only Japan's enormous success story aroused persistent and intense emotions on the part of Government officials and the American public alike. While "Japan-bashing" may have been popular, it was counterproductive; it lulled the American public into thinking that if only the Japanese would behave themselves, our economy would magically revive, and employment would boom once again. As former U.S. trade representative William E. Brock quipped: "My nightmare is that Japan does everything I ask it to do, then I wake up, and our deficit stays the same." But even Representative Richard A. Gephardt (D.-Mo.) -- the most strident critic of Japan in Congress -- admitted during his fruitless effort to win the 1988 Democratic nomination for President that no more than 20 percent of the trade deficit with Japan could be attributed to their "unfair" trading practices. . . .
The success of the Japanese in marketing goods here had an odd effect on some Americans: they rushed to buy the Toyotas and Sonys because their performance and quality were high. At the same time, they linked Japanese success with American failure. And the connection they tended to make was not that we might have been doing something wrong -- but that the Japanese must be taking unfair advantage. They failed to consider that, in the postwar period, Japan placed its bets on industrial and technological development, while America, especially under Presidents Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan, devoted too much of its financial and human resources to military competition with the Soviet Union. Today, it is little solace that we have won the cold war with the Soviet Union only to realize that we are losing on another front, against Japan, in terms of trade and markets.

HEADLINE: FLIGHT FROM CUBA: THE OVERVIEW;
President Considers a Cuban Blockade

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 21

 BODY:
As the flood of refugees out of Cuba continued unabated, the Clinton Administration warned President Fidel Castro today that the Administration would consider further steps, including a blockade of the island, if he did not take meaningful steps toward democracy.
Angrily accusing Mr. Castro of orchestrating the exodus, the White House chief of staff, Leon E. Panetta, said on the ABC News program "This Week," "We want to see Castro move toward a democratic government, and that clearly is not happening. As a consequence, we're putting pressures on the Castro Government." 
 Mr. Panetta's tough comments came as part of an aggressive new Administration strategy that intends to hasten the demise of the 35-year-old Communist government in Cuba and to pressure Mr. Castro to stanch the flow of refugees.
But hours after Mr. Panetta said the Administration would consider a blockade of the island, Administration officials began backing away from the threat. Acknowledging that mounting a unilateral blockade around the island would be difficult and would face widespread opposition in Latin America, they said the remarks were hypothetical and that no such action was imminent.
Despite President Clinton's announcement on Friday that he was ending the 28-year-old practice of granting entry to virtually all Cuban refugees, the flood of refugees continued this weekend. The Coast Guard said that, as of midnight, it had picked up 1,293 Cubans today, the most in a single day since the Mariel boatlift in 1980, and that it intercepted 1,189 Cubans on Saturday.
The two daily figures represent not only the most Cubans fleeing their nation by boat since the exodus began early this month, but also the highest daily totals since , when 125,000 Cubans fled to the United States.
The Coast Guard has brought additional ships and crews from ports along the Gulf Coast and Eastern Seaboard to help cope with the wave of refugees. Moreover, Navy vessels began picking up refugees at sea today, said a Coast Guard spokesman, Lt. (jg) Bob Engle.
The Administration toughened its approach toward Cuba after more than 4,000 Cubans took to ramshackle rafts and dinghies since Aug. 1. President Clinton announced on Friday that Cubans heading to Florida would be intercepted and held at the United States base at Guantanamo Bay.
With refugees continuing to surge out of Cuba this weekend despite the President's new strategy, the Administration today increased Guantanamo Bay's capacity to keep up with the wave of Cuban boat people.
"We are concerned about this," said a White House official. "We didn't expect the number to drop off immediately. We are redoubling our efforts to get the message across that this trip is very dangerous and you can't get to the U.S. this way."
In his television appearance today, Mr. Panetta repeated President Clinton's accusation that Mr. Castro has been trying to sweep masses of disgruntled Cubans toward United States shores to take some of the heat off the Cuban leader.
"We've got to continue to put pressure on Castro because the problem here is not the problem of refugees," Mr. Panetta said. "It's the problems within the Castro regime. That's what's causing this. And he's trying to use these migrants as a tool to try to influence our foreign policy."
Also appearing on "This Week," Gov. Lawton Chiles of Florida called for imposing a blockade if Mr. Castro allowed the exodus of boat people to escalate. With the United States virtually alone in pursuing a trade embargo against Cuba, a blockade would aim to cut off Cuba's trade with the rest of the world.
 
Saturday's Measures
 On Saturday, President Clinton announced that he would increase anti-Castro radio and television broadcasts and cut off the flow of about $500 million a year that Cuban-Americans send each year to relatives in Cuba. The President also moved to greatly restrict charter flights to Cuba and said he would push the United Nations to condemn Cuba's human-rights record.
The most potent new measure is the ban on sending hard currency to Cuba, a move that Administration officials say will severely squeeze the Castro Government because such cash shipments are Cuba's largest source of hard currency, after sugar exports and tourism.
"I think it will have a drastic effect on Cuba's economy," said Domingo Moreira, a board member of the Cuban-American National Foundation.
By some estimates these cash gifts to relatives in Cuba represent more than one-fourth of Cuba's hard currency earnings each year.
A State Department official said today, "Castro's refusal to do anything to try to put his economy back in order has gotten Cuba to the point where things are so perilous that additional sanctions like this may make them face the fact that they have to do something different in terms of reform."
In the view of Administration officials, the flow of American cash has helped prop up Mr. Castro by reducing hardship for thousands of Cuban families and by providing the Cuban Government with hard currency.
 
Harm to Average Cubans
 Administration officials admitted that the tightened sanctions could hurt average Cubans, the very people that Washington wants to help. These officials said they hoped the sanctions would make it plain to Mr. Castro that the economic situation was so untenable that he would have to give in to pressures for reform.
Representative Robert G. Torricelli, the New Jersey Democrat who heads the House Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere Affairs, defended the new measures.
"It is impossible to bring fundamental political change to Cuba without doing damage to the people who live on the island," he said. "If it were possible, we would attempt it. It will hurt near-term, but it is the only way of achieving the long-term goal of establishing freedom in Cuba."
For many Cubans, getting just a few dollars from relatives in Florida can help a family obtain basics like soap and cooking oil. These items are rationed but are readily available in hard-currency stores.
Most of the hard currency sent to Cubans ends up in the hands of the Government because those fortunate enough to obtain dollars often spend them in the Government's hard-currency shops.
The Cuban Government angrily denounced the Administration's new sanctions. The state-controlled news agency, Prensa Latina, said the sanctions "contradict the genuine international consensus favoring an end to pressures."
Cuba's state radio denounced President Clinton's moves as "reinforcing the harassment of Cuba," while the Foreign Ministry accused him of building a "concentration camp" for Cuban boat people at Guantanamo Bay.
The first 1,000 Cuban refugees bound for detention in Guatanamo Bay were scheduled to arrive there Monday aboard three Coast Guard cutters. Hundreds more were being transferred at sea to other ships that will make the day-and-a-half voyage around the western end of Cuba as they are filled with passengers.

A year ago, President Boris N. Yeltsin announced that he was preparing a "September barrage" against his sworn opposition in the Russian congress. By October, the metaphor had turned real, with tanks shelling the Parliament building.
This August, there is an eerie stability. Monthly inflation is down to 6 percent compared with 26 percent a year ago. Salaries are worth more with the ruble stronger, and consumer spending is up. There is consensus on economic policy under Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, who has adopted the tight-money policies he criticized in January. Mr. Yeltsin appears more energetic, the new Parliament is behaving itself and a divided opposition is apparently looking more toward 1996 elections than to counterrevolution in the streets. 
 On a trip this week down the Volga River, talking to ordinary Russians, Mr. Yeltsin had a new announcement: "I see that in many regions the economic slide has stopped."
That is a vast improvement, but how stable is it? Made pessimistic by their tortured history, few Russians like to hazard any bets. The country has been in tumult so long that any extended period without calamity is deeply unsettling.
Opinion polls still show ambivalence about the future, even as the newspapers debate whether the August 1991 coup attempt against Mikhail S. Gorbachev was an effort to save the country or to strangle it. Among Muscovites, traditionally the most cosmopolitan Russians, only 30 percent think capitalism will improve their lives and that of their families, while 37 percent say they still do not know. About 23 percent think things will become worse. A year ago, 26 percent expected improvement.
There are enormous problems in Russia, from crime, corruption and moral disorder to growing unemployment, unpaid salaries and intercompany debt. But as Sergei Pavlenko, head of Russia's Center for Economic Reforms, says: "The high-temperature fever crisis of the Russian economy is over."
A senior Western finance official put it differently: "We're happy with Russia now. Why? Because it's not on the precipice anymore. It may get there again, but it's kind of back-burner. It's costing us less in money and less in nerves."
 
Trying to Buy Time for Stability
 For lack of a better strategy in an extended period of thin budgets and greater domestic demands, Washington and other Western allies seem simply to be trying to buy Russia time.
Such a policy annoys Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev, who fears that Western miserliness and strategic neglect now, in such sharp contrast to the effort made to contain the Soviet Union, may feed political extremism. But Mr. Kozyrev agrees that Western aid is far less important than private investment, and that time is precisely what Russia needs.
Time to nurture democratic institutions, like political parties and juries. Time to pass practical laws governing free-market business. Time to learn new economic behavior. Time to get over the humiliation of the Soviet Union's collapse and regain some patriotic pride. Time to get rich enough not to feel embarrassed. Time to get used to stability itself.
For all Russia's problems, Mr. Pavlenko said, "Economic behavior among the population is beginning to change."
There are many positive signs this August.
At the VDNKh center, built to display the glories of Soviet technology, memorials to Yuri Gagarin, the first man in space, are ignored as Russians shop for imported televisions, videos, stereos and cars. VDNKh -- the All-Union Exhibition of the Achievements of the People's Economy -- is now a kind of shopping mall.
Russian stores are full of better clothes and groceries. Russians fill nightclubs, restaurants and health clubs whose prices would make a New Yorker blanch. Russians are lunching and brunching with cellular phones, electronic diaries and Hugo Boss suits. Russians are building huge, crenellated brick dachas, restoring Moscow's tattered office buildings and hiring foreign accountants. Russians are pouring into once-forbidden European vacation spots like Cyprus and Rimini, let alone Paris and London.
 
Hard-Line Influence Beginning to Wane
 For many people life is getting better. Their salaries buy more and they are spending more, with real household consumption up 18 percent over the same quarter last year.
In January, Mr. Chernomyrdin lost the most visible Westernized reformers in a Government deeply divided over economic policy after the strong showing of Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, a hard-line nationalist, in December's elections. Mr. Chernomyrdin, a former Energy Minister and industrialist, spoke of the need for an expansionary, big-spending budget, with inflation going up to 18 percent a month.
But pressed by the West and without reformers like Yegor T. Gaidar, Mr. Yeltsin's first Prime Minister, to blame, Mr. Chernomyrdin soon reversed himself. Not only did he begin to preach the need for low inflation and a tight hold on credits, he also enforced an economic consensus within the Government. The head of the Central Bank, Viktor V. Gerashchenko, without the former Parliament's support, took his cue from Mr. Chernomyrdin. Just as important, the bank stopped giving credits directly to enterprises, but only to the Government itself.
Having once compared privatization to Stalinist collectivization, Mr. Chernomyrdin has come to support the Privatization Minister, Anatoly B. Chubais, and has echoed his calls for managers to reform their enterprises or face bankruptcy.
Despite much wailing over steep drops in industrial production, much of that drop is statistically questionable because Russian figures barely touch the growing private economy. If in the old days production reports were inflated to meet quotas and earn bonuses, today they are minimized to reduce taxes and bribes. Economists also point to electricity consumption, which has dropped only about 2 percent despite higher prices, as a strong indicator that private production is taking up much of the slack.
The second stage of privatization, in which the Government sells its remaining 49 percent share of many companies, will bring at least $2 billion into state coffers this half-year alone. There will be more money next year, a transfusion that will lessen pressure to raise taxes or finagle special loans from the International Monetary Fund. Foreign investment itself is increasing, and could total $6 billion this year.
 
Benefit of Doubt From Power Elite
 As a centrist representative of the country's real power elite -- managers and bureaucrats -- Mr. Chernomyrdin has gotten a bigger benefit of the doubt than Mr. Gaidar, an academic economist who represents a much thinner slice of Russian life. Mr. Chernomyrdin, to the disgust of the Communist and nationalist opposition, has been carrying out the essence of Mr. Gaidar's policies. But with less dissent, he's doing a more effective job.
He and Mr. Yeltsin, who has been moving into the political center, have made a reassuring team, both at home and abroad. They have been helped by the new Constitution forced through in December, which established a strong presidency.
By stressing more muscular, nationalist themes, like fighting crime and enhancing Russian prestige, Mr. Yeltsin has been coopting the nationalist opposition, itself divided.
Mr. Zhirinovsky, who won 22.8 percent of the party-preference vote and does not dominate Parliament, is tiring his own supporters, half of whom would not vote for him again, according to opinion surveys. The former Vice President, Aleksandr V. Rutskoi, who was in jail during the December election for leading the old Parliament's revolt, is pardoned and on the campaign trail, likely to dilute the nationalist vote in 1996 elections, if they happen at all.
But if Russia follows other former Communist countries like Poland and Hungary, a lot of the disaffected vote will go to neo-Communists. Gennadi A. Zyuganov, the Communist Party leader, speaks more like a social democrat. He's in favor of private property and ownership of land, he says, "but the state, with honest officials, should regulate matters so the people are protected." It's not Locke, but it's not Stalin, either.
On the negative side, of course, there is a considerable weight of crime, corruption, confusion and economic distress. While most Russians seem to be doing better, many are not. In big military-industrial centers like Novosibirsk, huge factories are restructuring very slowly, keeping workers on minimum wages or forced vacations or not paying them at all for months. Underpaid nuclear scientists are striking. Companies, strapped for cash or preferring to invest it, are again running up huge debts to one another, totaling nearly $15 billion.
 
Fighting Inflation Or Unemployment
 This is the other side of a tight-money policy, which can work only if companies are convinced that the Government will not bail them out. Mr. Chernomyrdin is talking tough, but pressure to spend is growing from military, agricultural and industrial lobbies. Inflation is likely to hit 10 percent a month by autumn -- not awful, but not the 10 percent a year that would mark economic stabilization.
The Government continues to face a terrible choice between high inflation, with continued subsidies to industry, and rising unemployment, which could reach 10 percent of the workforce by year's end but produce faster recovery. High unemployment could also produce unrest, especially in cities like Novosibirsk.
Finding a medium path would be easier if the Government could make strategic decisions about which sectors to help and how to create a solid social safety net for those displaced by change.
The budget is also unreal, with tax revenues far below projections and new spending "off budget" to pacify vital players like the military. Deficit and other targets agreed on with the International Monetary Fund are sure to slip.
To raise more money, the bureaucracy is imposing bizarre taxes, which can take 80 percent of profits. Such taxes encourage evasion and corruption and are a big disincentive to foreign investment. Mr. Chernomyrdin complains, but the bureaucrats remain a state unto themselves.
In a more general way, there is a deep sense of moral disorder, with too many crooks profiting and too many honorable scholars scraping by. Russia's democratic roots are thin; its political parties are weak and personalized; its courts are laughable; the average Ivan has little more recourse against the state than he did under the Soviet Union.
Mr. Yeltsin, when he's visible, acts more like a czar or a Communist general secretary than an elected President. The new Parliament is more interested in electioneering than in making laws, allowing Mr. Yeltsin to continue to rule by decree, many of which are ignored.
Some Western diplomats, worried about 1996 elections, say few will complain if that vote, though mandated in the Constitution, is postponed until 1998 -- buying Russia a little more time.
"Even if the situation improves just a little bit, and people feel this -- and I'm not talking about attaining world standards -- then this will help lessen the appeal of nationalism," said Kronid Lyubarsky, deputy editor of New Times magazine. "If we can live through the next two or three years without a significant worsening of the economy, then I believe we'll overcome the greatest danger."

HEADLINE: Baseball's Bottom Line -- A special report.;
Colleagues or Competitors? 28 Owners in the Spotlight

 BODY:
The following article is based on reporting by Richard Sandomir, Barry Meier and Matthew Purdy and was written by Mr. Purdy with Mr. Sandomir.
The Yankees' $40 million-a-year cable television contract -- the biggest in baseball and the envy of other club owners -- is the financial equivalent of a changeup pitch. When it was signed in 1988, it looked like a potential bonanza to other owners who were due to share in the contract. Until it faded away. 
 American League regulations say the Yankees must give about one-quarter of their annual cable money -- potentially $10 million -- to other teams. But the way the game is played, the Yankees and George Steinbrenner, their shrewd principal owner, manage to give up only $4.4 million a year and keep the rest.
In baseball, as the rich teams get richer, the gap is widening between clubs like the Yankees and the Boston Red Sox and poorer teams like the San Diego Padres and the Pittsburgh Pirates, which felt compelled to shed expensive players to stay afloat.
The players strike has halted a season of remarkable performances by players like Ken Griffey Jr. and Matt Williams and soured a season of redemption for fans of first-place teams like the Yankees and the Montreal Expos. But the strife between the owners of baseball's have and have-not teams is likely to have a more profound impact on the game.
The delicate finances of a few teams are making the fractious group of 28 team owners confront a question it has long avoided: whether to continue as competitors or become partners in a new financial structure that forces richer teams to more generously share their wealth with their less-fortunate brethren.
The notion of forming a partnership is inimical to the culture of baseball, where owners regard their clubs as fiefdoms, jealously guarding their financial secrets and resolutely protecting their profits.
Any change in the financial relationship among teams could affect their ever-rising resale values, which make even the most troubled franchises attractive to investors. The Baltimore Orioles, a financially stable team with a heralded new stadium, were sold three times from 1979 to 1993, the price rising from $12 million to $173 million. But even the Pittsburgh Pirates are attracting considerable interest despite their well-known problems. The Pirates are on the block for an initial price of $85 million, which is more than twice what they sold for nine years ago.
The issue is being brought to a head as less profitable clubs -- lacking lucrative television deals and friendly stadium leases from host cities -- claim they cannot compete for players in the existing open market and will either fail financially or be driven to seek more lucrative markets.
"It is a system that frankly is broken, that just doesn't work," said Tal Smith, a former executive with several baseball teams, including the Yankees and Houston Astros, who is now a consultant to teams.
In January, after lengthy and divisive discussions, the wealthier clubs reluctantly agreed to aid poorer teams through a revenue-sharing plan. But they said the plan would take effect only if the union agreed to a limit on player payrolls in a new labor contract. The union has rejected the proposed salary cap, sparking the strike that is in its 11th day today.
The owners have agreed to share an estimated $50 million in revenues with less profitable teams, according to people familiar with the plan. Under the plan, one team executive said, the Seattle Mariners and the Expos would each receive about $10 million annually from the pool, while other aggrieved teams would receive less.
Jeff Smulyan, the former owner of the Mariners, said he understood the attitude of less-profitable teams. "They're saying, 'It's more important that we survive than your profit margin go down,' " he said.
Whatever the resolution of the strike, forging an equitable partnership among the teams will be difficult because of the different kinds of ownership, from corporations like Anheuser-Busch, to limited partnerships, like the Yankees, or single proprietorships, like the Dodgers.
Each structure has reasons to reduce profits and uses various types of financial legerdemain to reach that goal. When a team owner has several other businesses related to the ball club, " the only way you can get an accurate picture is to consolidate all the businesses, which they don't do," said Roger Noll, a Stanford University economist who has examined the owners' books for the players union.
 
Art of the Deal
The Envy of All Cable Contracts
 A true, unvarnished account of owners' finances is likely to ignite controversies, like the one concerning the Yankees' cable contract.
Teams can legally reduce profits by undervaluing contracts for their TV rights, by charging expenses from an owner's outside businesses against a team's revenues, by paying owners high salaries or by selling stadium refreshments and by advertising through separate corporations controlled by team owners, rather than through the team itself. These practices allow teams to reduce money available either for player salaries or for sharing with other teams.
The Yankees' 12-year, $486 million cable TV contract with the MSG Network is one of the most envied deals in baseball. Under the current revenue sharing system, which was adopted in the mid-1960's, about 25 percent of each club's revenues from cable TV is allocated to a league pool.
But rather than signing a single cable contract with MSG, Mr. Steinbrenner signed several MSG contracts, which pay the team unusually large fees for promotional considerations, the rights to videos, the team's film library and broadcast TV rights. This practice greatly diminishes the amount of money paid strictly for putting the games on cable television, the only category of payments subject to baseball's sharing plan.
As a result, the Yankees shared 25 percent of only $19.9 million with American League owners last year, a contribution of $4.4 million, instead of 25 percent of the team's full fee of more than $40 million from MSG, which would have been a contribution of more than $10 million.
"The A.L. was in revolt a few years ago, trying to get more of that money," said Tom Villante, a broadcasting consultant to several teams.
Poorer teams may go into full-scale revolt if broader-based revenue sharing is not enacted soon. Peter Angelos, owner of the Orioles, predicts there will be a plan, but he is against one that would be simple charity. He said he favored one that would encourage cities to subsidize the cost of new stadiums and help put teams on sound financial footing.
Many wealthier owners agreed to the revenue sharing plan in January even while saying it smacked of welfare. "This is socialism at work and baseball is still a free-enterprise sport," Mr. Steinbrenner said after the plan was adopted.
Just as some of the richer owners are reluctant to form a partnership, players do not want to tie their salaries to the financial fortunes of the owners. Union officials say that while owners cry poverty, they always make profits when they sell their teams and bidders are waiting to buy even the most distressed teams. The union also argues that bad management, not player salaries, accounts for teams' financial misfortunes.
"What they say on their profit and loss statements doesn't matter," said Eugene Orza, the associate executive director of the players union. "It's the viability as an institution. It's the record attendance, people going to more games than ever before."
Baseball executives have rarely been as candid about how profits and losses are determined as Paul Beeston, the Toronto Blue Jays' president. "Under generally accepted accounting principles," he said in 1978 when he was a team vice president, "I can turn a $4 million profit into a $2 million loss, and I can get every national accounting firm to agree with me."
Team owners in other sports have operated more like financial partners than those in baseball. For more than 40 years, the National Football League has shared gate receipts, 60 percent for the home team, 40 percent for visitors. Network television and licensing revenues are split equally, leaving only stadium concessions and luxury box cash kept by home teams. Since the league sells all games to broadcast and cable networks, there are no disparities in local TV revenues.
But in baseball there has been little effort to level the playing field. Baseball is still largely a game of local appeal with roots and fan bases for some teams dating to the last century. As a result, baseball revenues have mostly been held close to home.
American League home teams split gate receipts on an 80-20 basis with visiting teams. In the National League, visiting teams get a mere 43 cents from each ticket sold, or perhaps about 5 percent of the receipts.
Baseball teams split national TV and licensing money equally, and each team shares about 25 percent of its revenues from local cable contracts. But there is no sharing of revenue from local broadcast TV and radio contracts or from luxury boxes, concessions or parking.
Baseball owners have resisted leadership. While strong commissioners in both basketball and football have forged revenue sharing arrangements and salary caps with players, baseball owners ousted Commissioner Fay Vincent two years ago for involving himself in matters the owners wanted to control, likelabor and divisional realignment.
The owners then watered down the commissioner's powers, removing him from labor affairs, and installed as the acting commissioner Bud Selig, the owner of the Milwaukee Brewers, a needy small-market team that would benefit from the largess of wealthier teams.
 
Two Case Studies
One Team Up, One Team Down
 The recent history of the Pirates and the Orioles is a striking contrast in team finances.
The Pirates, National League East champions from 1990 to 1992, have seen their financial and division standing plummet as star players like Bobby Bonilla, Barry Bonds and Doug Drabek signed free-agent contracts with other teams. The team had a combined operating loss of $24.9 million in 1992 and 1993, according to team financial records, reflecting low attendance, a meager TV contract and a subpar share of stadium and concession revenues.
Some economists linked to the players union said the team inflated expenses to paint the gloomiest picture possible, but few who are familiar with the team doubt it is troubled.
"We're trying to do everything we can at this level -- improved lease and improved stadium -- but we don't think that's going to be enough unless major league baseball also makes some changes," said Mark Pollack, special counsel to Mayor Tom Murphy of Pittsburgh.
In Baltimore, the high-caliber play is barely keeping pace with the business boon from the 1992 opening of Oriole Park at Camden Yards, the old-style, $150 million stadium that is regularly sold out. Stadium revenues let the team lavish an extra $10 million on player salaries this year, according to club records. Team coffers have swelled from its lease with the city that gives the team all but a small fraction of every dollar spent on tickets, concessions and luxury boxes.
The Orioles exemplify what some experts believe other teams must do to prosper -- persuade politicians and taxpayers to finance a new stadium and then to let the team keep most of the ball park's operating profits.
State and local officials were determined to keep the Orioles in Baltimore, said Michael Megna, a Milwaukee-based expert on team values and finances, and "as a result, the Orioles got a very sweet deal."
That deal has also dramatically affected the team's value. Major league clubs have appreciated 15 to 20 percent annually, some economists said, and few have done as well as the Orioles.
The Orioles were purchased last October by Mr. Angelos, a Baltimore lawyer, and a group of investors for $173 million. Four years earlier, Eli Jacobs, a New York investor, had acquired the Orioles for $70 million from the estate of the Washington lawyer Edward Bennett Williams. In 1979, Williams had bought the team for $12 million.
But losing money doesn't necessarily ruin a ball club's resale value. The Pirates, which were last sold nine years ago for $40 million, are on the block again and suitors are lining up. Bidding starts at $85 million.
In any case, can owners be financial partners, with or without a cap?
"I don't think they have the emotional or psychological drive," said Andrew Zimbalist, author of "Baseball and Billions," a study of baseball economics. "The game has an engineering problem in its ownership structure. But it is possible."
Those engineering problems have let owners use their discretion, as well as tax and accounting rules, to reduce profits.
For example, Mr. Jacobs, the former Orioles owner, took a loan of $6 million from the ball club to help another one of his businesses. The loan was never repaid to the Orioles, according to Mr. Angelos.
The owners of two teams also control the television stations that broadcast their games. According to financial analysts and baseball executives, these owners pay their teams less than a market rate for the right to broadcast games, which reduces team revenues. The Chicago Cubs and WGN, a superstation picked up by more than 30 million cable TV subscribers nationwide, are both owned by the Tribune Company. The Atlanta Braves and TBS, a larger superstation, are owned by the Turner Broadcasting System.
Mr. Noll, the Stanford economist, said, "The Cubs' local broadcasting revenue is one-third to one-half than if you had a competitive bidding for them."
Although Mr. Turner paid major league baseball about $15 million in 1993 because TBS has become a national carrier, it pays the Braves, its corporate cousin, less than $10 million for its local rights. WGN is believed to pay the Cubs about $6 million.
"Whatever the Braves are getting from TBS is minuscule compared to what TBS means to Turner's empire," said Bryan Burns, president of the Paragon Alliance, a sports TV consultant.
In St. Louis, the Cardinals' owner, Anheuser-Busch, has a separate corporation, Civic Center Properties, which records all the team's parking and concession revenues. Until recently, Mr. Noll said, Anheuser-Busch's financial reports never reflected those revenues. Now the brewery provides unaudited figures to baseball. "It's not that no one knew how much they got in parking and concessions, and they've been open that this is how they did their finances," Mr. Noll said. "The nefariousness comes from Bud Selig saying teams are losing money, knowing full well there are good reasons for that. To their credit, the Cardinals have never said they're in desperate straits."
 
Outlook
Teams Encouraged To Stay Put
 The effects of more generous revenue sharing in baseball are uncertain. Money may buy proven talent in ballplayers, but it doesn't necessarily translate into a winning club. The Expos illustrate that point, in reverse: with an $18.8 million payroll, baseball's second-lowest, they had the best record before the strike.
The more profitable clubs are likely to continue to have qualms about expanded revenue sharing -- especially without a salary cap -- because it will not only cut into their cash but could also eventually reduce their resale value.
But for less-profitable teams, revenue sharing should reduce the need to move to cities that promise a better financial picture. Not that teams are free to move wherever they want. Under baseball's exemption from antitrust law, owners control not only the creation of new franchises but also the movement of existing teams.
Baseball wants its teams to stay put even if the policy appears to ignore economics. The owners do not want to antagonize fans of current teams and risk igniting a political reaction that could lead to a review of their antitrust status. Also, they want to reserve attractive new cities for expansion teams that would have to pay hefty franchise fees to the owners to buy into baseball.
The recent experience of the San Francisco Giants demonstrates how firmly the owners seek to control the culture and finances of baseball.
In 1992, Bob Lurie was forced by his fellow owners to accept an 11th-hour offer of $100 million from local interests to buy the Giants rather than a $115 million bid by investors who wanted to move the team to a stadium in Tampa-St. Petersburg, Fla.
Tampa-St. Petersburg remains a likely market for expansion -- or for a struggling team seeking new life.

HEADLINE: Used American Jeans Power A Thriving Industry Abroad

BYLINE: By SALLIE HOFMEISTER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PASADENA, Calif.

 BODY:
When the giant flea market outside the Rose Bowl opens at dawn, bargain hunters from Thailand and Japan are the first on the field. Pockets bulging with wads of $100 bills and carting big empty suitcases strapped to luggage dollies, they load up on American artifacts like weathered leather jackets and rock-and-roll memorabilia.
But the real quarry is used jeans -- especially Levis -- which can fetch as much as several thousand dollars back home. 
 As another generation of teen-agers the world over embraces American culture, secondhand jeans have become status symbols. A cottage industry, a thriving underground economy, has sprouted west of the Mississippi to buy, wash and repair used Levis for resale in countries from Finland to Australia.
No one knows for sure how many pairs are being shipped abroad. Precisely how much profit is made is also a mystery because dealers are preternaturally closed-mouthed about this all-cash business, as much to keep their competition from rooting out their precious sources of supply as, in some cases, to stay clear of the Internal Revenue Service.
What the dealers do say is that a vintage pair of jeans -- like Levis from the 1950's and 60's -- can bring $3,000 or more abroad, although most of the jeans they sell there bring less than $100.
All in all, millions of pairs of used jeans are changing hands each year, worth tens, even hundreds, of millions of dollars at retail. And the opening of new markets like Vietnam and China will only add to the demand.
It is a business almost as secretive as the drug trade, and nearly as splintered. But on the second Sunday of every month, outside the Rose Bowl, everyone who is anyone in this exclusive circle, grown to perhaps 100 people from a handful a few years ago, shows up to buy and sell used jeans by the bale and to bargain for the vintage pieces.
On a recent Sunday, Max Shapiro, a San Francisco dealer, was having what he called an uncharacteristically slow day. His biggest sale was a pair of Levis from the 60's that brought $150, meager compared with the $3,300 he made on one sale another day.
Nat and Lucky Wongchaiwat, a brother-sister team from Thailand, frequently hunt here. In their early 20's, they make a monthly pilgrimage for 10,000 pairs for their store in Bangkok. Recently, they placed a big order at Mr. Shapiro's warehouse in San Francisco. At the Rose Bowl, they look for vintage pairs and new sources of jeans.
Japan is still the biggest customer for used jeans, though the boom there has cooled somewhat. But even Thailand, a much less prosperous nation, has become a major importer, buying about 100,000 pairs a month, some dealers say.
"They can buy jeans made in Hong Kong for $6 but would rather have 501's for $100," said Val Marco, a Los Angeles dealer who left his job as a vice president at a Silicon Valley robotics company to sell jeans after repeatedly getting offers for his Levis on business trips abroad.
 
A One-by-One Search
 Dealers collect used jeans one by one at flea markets, garage sales and thrift stores. They scour small towns and farm communities like Lubbock, Tex., and Cody, Wyo., advertising in local papers that they will pay 50 cents to $15 a pair.
On the appointed day they pull into town and do business out of tents or the backs of tractor-trailers. They sort their purchases by quality and send them to laundries, some of which clean nothing but used jeans, and then on to shops that patch and mend them.
They sell some jeans through trendy vintage-clothing, jeans and urban-cowboy stores. Encouraged by the grunge, retro and recycling movements, dress-down days at the office and perhaps even the casual style of the Democratic White House, these stores abound on the West Coast.
The bulk of the market, however, is abroad. It doubtless helps that most used jeans are cheaper than new Levis, which cost $80 to $100 overseas, compared with about $35 here. But the market really exists, both sellers and buyers agree, because foreign youth is obsessed with the American past. Used Air Jordan athletic shoes from the 1980's, sweaty and soiled, can sell for $800 or more in Japan. Old Pendleton shirts go for $40 in Tokyo.
 
Cool and Rugged
 But nothing says Made in America louder than jeans, especially the denim 501's with the button fly that Levi Strauss & Company has made since 1873. Worn to a softness that takes five years to achieve, used 501's are as cool as James Dean and as rugged as the Wild West.
Kazuhiko Hanzawa, a sales clerk at Marvin's, a used-jeans and sneakers store in the Harajuka district of Tokyo, says 501's are the most popular brand sought by teen-age buyers. Prices at the store range from 10,000 to 100,000 yen, or about $100 to $1,000.
Retail prices vary depending on the age, condition and country. "Grade A" 501's -- those without holes or stains -- may fetch $40 to $50, while lower-quality Grade B's go for about $20. Vintage 501's are among the most prized; predating 1983 and known as Red Lines, they are hand cut from a single piece of fabric whose red-selvage edge is the inseam. They typically retail abroad for $70 or more.
 
A Tightening Supply
 But the highest prices are commanded by a fuller-cut and wider-legged Levis design popular in the 1950's and 60's. The jeans are called Big E's, for the "E" used until 1971 in the logo on the distinctive tiny red Levi tag. They typically bring $500 to $2,000 in Japan.
Prices of all used jeans have jumped as supplies have tightened.
"I could easily sell 40,000 pair a month if I could find them," said Peter Anestos of Pocatello, Idaho, who became a dealer four years ago after his business as a steel mill equipment dismantler fell apart. "When I started, I was getting $10 to $13, wholesale, for the best 501's and now I'm getting $25. Of course, the price I pay for jeans has also doubled."
Many people in the business estimate there are 30 to 50 big dealers, who may ship 10,000 pairs a month, with a few handling double or triple that volume. Some are so aggressive that they try to corner the market in certain states. Most dealers are on the West Coast because the more valuable button-fly 501's are prevalent there. (Easterners tend to prefer the zipper fly because it doesn't let in cold air.)
No one believes the rage in used jeans has hurt Levi Strauss, the biggest marketer of jeans in the world, whose sales of Levis, estimated at $4.8 billion last year, dwarfs the used-jeans market. In fact, Levi itself has responded to the vintage wave. Last year it introduced, both here and abroad, 501's with a "broken in" finish achieved by a combination of stone washing and sand blasting.
"It's probably the second- or third-most-popular finish after stone-washed and after black," said Susan Shepherd, manager of the Original Levis Store, opposite Bloomingdale's in Manhattan, where many shoppers are foreigners. "People definitely want that look."
Even high-fashion designers like Ralph Lauren have recognized the trend. The designer introduced a line last year called RRL to duplicate the quality and construction of hard-to-find vintage pieces like old leather jackets, untailored tweed coats and worn and weathered jeans. It took a year to develop the washing technology to make the worn look possible.
Levi has also come out with something for vintage lovers like the singer Bryan Adams, one of the biggest Levis collectors in the world. Last year, the company reissued the "Big E's" design. Called "Capital E's," the jeans sell for $100 a pair.
 
Limited Number Sold

No one expects the Capital E's to cut into sales of used jeans. For one thing, Levi is selling only a limited quantity (it will not say how many). For another, the new denim cannot compare with the original nubbier, inkier fabric, which fades to the most desirable deep blue. Petrochemical-based indigo dyes were reformulated during the oil crisis of the 1970's, and Levi Strauss changed fabrics in the 1980's, when it switched from hand cutting of fabric to jigsaw cutting to improve efficiencies.
In any case, used-jean dealers are more worried about their smaller rivals. Competition in the last year has driven a few dealers to search for jeans in cities as well as in the country by setting up networks of collection sites like pawn shops, video stores and dry cleaners that buy jeans from their patrons for a cut of the revenue.
Mr. Shapiro has signed up 90 drop points in California and 20 in Texas for Green for Jeans, the used-jeans company in Point Richmond, Calif., that his brother Bruce started. The company has an additional 15 jeans collection sites in Missouri, and next month it will open a warehouse in Osaka to be closer to buyers.
Like many dealers, the Shapiros have also branched into new lines, like Air Jordans and Pendleton shirts.
 
Looking for Trends
 Mr. Marco says rock-and-roll clothes from the 1960's and 70's are also hot. He watches vintage-savvy designers like Ralph Lauren for the latest trend. Though Mr. Lauren will not talk about his shopping habits, Mr. Marco has heard that he is buying sweatshirts from the early 1900's. "He'll copy them and sell them this fall," Mr. Marco predicts.
Still, for dealers like Mr. Marco, nothing compares with the romance, history and mystery of old jeans.
"I bought 40 pieces from the Great Depression a few weeks back from a lady in Oklahoma who had boxes of her mother's clothes in the garage," he said. "She had the whole family's jeans and they must have had six or seven kids. You could see how much that family suffered from their jeans, how the grandma had sewed on the patches. One pair had 100 patches."

HEADLINE: Fund Set Up To Help City With Projects

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
In an unusual effort to enlist big business in the economic development of New York City, a prominent group of executives is trying to raise $100 million in private funds to invest in such diverse projects as a new Central Park restaurant, expansion of the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center and keeping the Yankees in the Bronx.
The New York City Partnership, whose members include the top executives of more than 150 of the city's largest companies, said those companies and many wealthy individuals would be asked to donate $1 million each to the fund, which would be operated with no intent to turn a profit. 
 Partnership officials said that the campaign to create an investment fund was approved by the group's board of directors on Wednesday and that the group would begin seeking contributions next month.
The idea for the fund was hatched in early 1993 by Henry R. Kravis, the Wall Street financier and leveraged-buyout specialist, who is a member of the Partnership and has been appointed chairman of the fund's board. In an interview yesterday, he said he conceived of the fund as a vehicle for "pulling together" the city's corporate leaders and "emulating what has been done in other cities," including Atlanta, Minneapolis and Tulsa, Okla.
 
Selecting of Projects
 No projects have been selected, and Mr. Kravis said the fund's board, which would select the projects to be financed, would include Partnership members from both corporations and the world of cultural and educational institutions. Partnership officials, who have been privately preparing their campaign for months, agreed to discuss it after a copy of their board's descriptive material was obtained on Friday by The New York Times.
Jerry I. Speyer, a Manhattan real-estate developer and chairman of the Partnership, said $15 million had already been committed in the first 15 "cold calls" -- contacts made without any advance preparation -- to members of the group last week.
In documents circulated among the Partnership's board members last week, the group said the fund was intended to "serve as a vehicle to rally the city's private sector" and generate money for public improvements "as a civic initiative rather than a money-making venture."
Mr. Speyer said the fund would not finance any project completely but would provide the "front money" to pay for such things as environmental studies, architectural work, reviews by neighborhood groups and other work that often bogs down large developments and public improvements.
The investments would come largely through short-term loans or loan guarantees, he said, in the hope that those would lead to more financing from other sources. Once loans are paid back, the money would be recycled into other projects.
Mr. Speyer, who is the president of Tishman Speyer Properties, which has built large office buildings in several American and European cities, said the goal was to invest in "large, high impact" projects that the Partnership believes would be of particular benefit to New York City.
Projects that would warrant consideration might include an addition to the Javits Convention Center, loan guarantees necessary to bring political conventions to the city, a new transit hub in the Sunnyside Yards in Queens, a restaurant at the north end of Central Park and neighborhood improvements around Yankee Stadium, Partnership officials said.
They said the Partnership might also consider helping finance a new building to house the New York Stock Exchange and the American Stock Exchange.
Final plans for the fund have been worked out in recent months by a team that included two economic-development authorities who had been members of the administration of Mayor David N. Dinkins -- Barry F. Sullivan, the former Deputy Mayor for Finance, who is now president of the Partnership, and Carl Wiesbrod, formerly head of the city's Economic Development Corporation, who worked on plans for the investment fund as a consultant.
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, who had been told of the broad outline of the Partnership's plan months ago, was informed of the details on Friday. In an interview, he said raising $100 million "is certainly viable in the weathiest city in the world."
Even if the fund-raising target is not reached, he said, the Partnership's effort would benefit New York. "It is evidence of a very powerful new synergism between the private sector and government," he said.
 
'A Great Idea'
 At City Hall, economic aides to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani were informed of the plan for the first time on Friday. "We think it's a great idea," said Cristyne F. Lategano, a spokeswoman for the Mayor. "This is the kind of thing necessary to jump-start the economy."
Mr. Sullivan said the campaign to enlist business support for public projects was in some ways similar to the marshaling of corporate support that occurred in the mid-1970's, when the city was close to bankruptcy. Several Wall Street executives acted as volunteer consultants, and many landlords volunteered to pay their real-estate taxes in advance.
The difference now, he said, "is that we are not in a crisis."
"This is a vote of confidence in the city," he said. "Business people feel good about Mayor Giuliani's effort to downsize government, and we are offering a flip side to that, an effort to create jobs and build the economy."
Although Mr. Kravis said his idea for the fund sprang from the success of economic-development efforts in some other cities, Partnership officials said they knew of no other fund like the one the Partnership envisions for New York. The closest parallel is in Cleveland, where a business group called Cleveland Tomorrow has raised $50 million for projects, including a new sports complex for that city's professional baseball and basketball teams.
But unlike the fund planned by the Partnership, the one in Cleveland makes long-term loans to developers at interest rates that will bring in a profit. "We absolutely try to make as much money as possible," said Joe Roman, executive director of Cleveland Tomorrow.
Some details of how the Partnership's fund will be set up -- whether it is entirely a nonprofit corporation or includes a profit-making limited partnership -- remain to be worked out, Mr. Weisbrod said.
But Mr. Speyer said the intent was not complicated: each contributor of $1 million would be committed to the fund for 15 years and then could only expect to get $1 million back, plus enough to account for inflation. "The return will be psychic," he said.
Creation of the fund, which is to be called the New York Investment Partnership, would not be the first project by the Partnership that sets it apart from most big-city business groups. Formed in 1978 as an adjunct to the city's Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Partnership has for years sponsored the city's largest summer-jobs program for young people and, through a housing-development arm, has had more than 9,000 new homes constructed for low- and moderate-income families.
 
Behind-the-Scenes Role
 The Partnership's members include a who's who of the city's corporate elite, including the board chairmen of Morgan Stanley, American Express, Philip Morris, Chase Manhattan, NBC, Grey Advertising, Price Waterhouse, Liz Claiborne and Mitsubishi International, as well as top officials of universities, museums and civic groups.
The group has also played a behind-the-scenes role in trying to persuade companies to remain and expand in New York City, providing a fraternity of corporate movers and shakers who are not reluctant to twist the arms of any of their colleagues who are about to stray.
Mr. Speyer suggested that the same spirit would apply to the Partnership's fund-raising effort.
"I wouldn't say that our members are absolutely obligated to participate," he said. "Let's just say I'd be very surprised if they don't."

HEADLINE: New Tax Hits Stocks In Israel

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TEL AVIV, Aug. 21

 BODY:
The Israeli stock market plummeted nearly 10 percent today, as jittery investors were given the first chance to react to a Government decision last week to impose a capital gains tax on stock profits.
The benchmark Mishtanim index fell 18.22 points, or 9.93 percent, to 165.18, and analysts expect further declines Monday morning. 
 The market erupted into pandemonium early as sellers unloaded stocks. Tel Aviv Stock Exchange officials said trading started with sell orders of two billion shekels, or $660 million.
Market officials, for the first time in the exchange's 40-year-history, lifted a 10 percent limit on the fluctuation of share prices within a single day. The market's usual closing time was also extended by four hours. Losses on individual share prices ranged from 10 to 20 percent.
 
A Surprise for the Market
 Ninety minutes into trading, the Government tried to soften the effects of the new tax, allowing stock profits to be offset against losses. But brokers said the change had little effect on the market.
"If every sale that was profitable was taxed a flat 10 percent, regardless of other losses, your grand total at the end of the day could be a big loss," said Eddy Shalev, the director of the Tel Aviv office of Oscar Gruss & Son, the largest dealer of Israeli stocks in the United States. "You would end up not with a 10 percent real tax, but a much higher tax."
The market was taken by surprise on Tuesday when the Government announced that it would impose a 10 percent tax on stock profits beginning Jan. 1. The Government then closed the market until today.
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin said in June 1993 that he would not impose a capital gains tax. But on Monday, Israel announced a higher-than-expected rise of 1.1 percent in inflation for July. The figure brought the annual inflation rate to 13.5 percent, well above the official forecast of 8 percent. Mr. Rabin, treasury officials said, was persuaded to adopt the tax in hopes of curbing inflation.
"When speaking of a Prime Minister and Finance Minister, don't expect them to tell the whole truth when speaking of a devaluation or when speaking of a new taxation policy," Mr. Rabin said after the announcement last week.
Finance Minister Avraham Shohat said: "This temporary instability will finally result in a much more stable stock market. To make big changes, and to be part of the outside world, we must, like other countries, impose a capital gains tax."
The opposition Likud party, which opposes the measure, called today for a special session of the Parliament to debate the tax, which, in its initial form, is expected to raise about $167 million a year.
"This is total chaos," said Binyamin Netanyahu, the head of Likud. "It is not the way to build an economy."
Treasury officials said today, after the amendment to the tax, that investors could choose between options when purchasing stocks. The first option will allow investors to pay a flat 10 percent on any profits. The second option will allow investors to make any losses tax deductible, but subject any profits made in the market to a 20 to 25 percent tax.
 
Only Limited Orders
 The capital gains tax comes as other taxes, such as import taxes on items like computers as well as purchase taxes on housing, have been lowered. Taxing share profits, officials said, will bring in revenues that will permit the Government to cut other taxes, like import duties on raw materials, that have fueled rising retail prices.
"I hope this in-between stage is short," said Jakov Frenkel, the governor of Israel's Central Bank. "The main reason for taxing capital gains was to introduce reason and order into the economy and to cut other taxes that have a much more destructive effect on the public."
The stock exchange, to prevent a steeper decline, only permitted limit orders, thus making it impossible to access the full impact of the new law. Heavy losses, at least early in the day, are expected Monday when the market, will, for the first time, allow market orders.
The tax is seen by many brokers as a severe blow to Israel's mutual fund companies.
 
Sales to Pension Funds
 "This is very bad for mutual funds because it will make it unwise for institutional investors, such as pension funds or insurance companies, to invest in mutual funds," Mr Shalev said. "If the mutual fund companies are forced to implement a 10 percent tax on the profits of each sale, corporations will, in essence, be taxed twice.
"It will also be unwise for pension funds to invest in mutual funds in the stock exchange because pension funds are totally exempt for any taxes," he said, "even with the new law. It will be better for them to invest directly in the stock exchange."
Once stocks dip low enough, investors expect the pension funds to step in and begin to buy. This could happen, brokers said, as early as Monday afternoon.
The new tax is also expected to slow foreign investment in Israel's stock market. In the last few months, brokers estimate that the market attracted between $200 million and $300 million, most from Britain and the United States. Israel, given the peace prospects, has been touted by many brokers as an emerging market.
"It will be very difficult for institutions in America to explain the primitive tax scheme to investors," said Mr. Shalev. "American taxes take into consideration losses, even from previous years. This will not be the case here."
Israel's stock market has a capitalization of about $35 billion. The Mishtanim index involves 99 of the most-traded stocks out of a total of about 700 companies are traded. The market has fallen about 25 percent since the end of the year.
A middle-aged coule from Lod with five children were among the small investors despondent after today's trading. The wife, who like her husband insisted on anonymity, said that all year "the bank kept telling us not to sell, so we didn't sell."
"Everyday our stocks went down," she said. "Now we have lost 60 percent of our savings."

HEADLINE: Haiti Rulers Hold Relief Fuel, Endangering Lives

BYLINE: By RICK BRAGG, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, Aug. 21

 BODY:
The mothers and fathers of half-starved children stand over their beds in the tuberculosis ward at Grace Children's Hospital and mumble prayers for mercy, miracles and diesel fuel.
The patients are kept alive by medicine that must be chilled in refrigerators, which are powered mostly by generators in a country where electrical power winks in and out like fireflies. Now the level of care at this charity hospital, like much of the medical care and feeding of Haiti's poor, is being threatened by the Government's refusal to release fuel donated by the United States and other nations hoping to insure that relief efforts continue. 
 Some hospitals, unable to use their generators because the fuel was held back, have already been forced to throw out crucial medical supplies that became ruined during long power blackouts. Relief workers say most of Haiti's free clinics, water-pumping stations, food distribution centers and almost all relief efforts will eventually cease if the military Government does not release the fuel.
More than 500,000 gallons in 55-gallon drums -- mostly diesel fuel and gasoline -- have been stored in Port-au-Prince since the shipments began arriving this year while relief organizations used up the last of their reserves, said Ross Mountain, the relief coordinator in Haiti for the United Nations.
 
Fuel Is Called Vital
 "The fuel program is the essential part of the total operation," Mr. Mountain said. "It is vital to the provision of water in and outside Port-au-Prince, the transportation of food, the function of hospitals, the transportation of medical supplies, and essential to the lives of millions of Haitians."
Without that fuel, millions of Haiti's poor in the countryside will almost certainly endure more hardship because they depend on food provided by aid groups. People who depend on hospitals and medicines in the cities and all over Haiti will suffer and die, say relief workers who did not want to be identified for fear of angering the Haitian Government.
The Government provides little or no aid, so the welfare of many of its 7 million people depends on outsiders. The feeding and care of Haitians by international relief operations has continued even as the embargo squeezes the economy and as threats of an invasion by the United States deepen tension.
Responding to the crisis, Haitian officials said on Friday that the Government, which has not officially seized the fuel, understood the difference between politics and aid.
"We remain hopeful that the authorities understand the severity of the situation," Mr. Mountain said. "I remain optimistic."
But to the people who depend on that fuel for the medical treatment of their children, the distinction between "seized" and "held" has little meaning.
During visiting hours last week at the hospital, Dieu Bon Desama stood over his 7-month-old son, Abdiass, and watched him struggle to breathe. The hospital treats 300 children every day, children whose parents cannot afford to pay for the care.
There are not enough cribs to go around in the hospital, so some children are tied with strips of cloth to narrow beds to keep them from falling off the side. Abdiass is so thin that his eyes seem huge in his narrow face, but his father said that he was getting better and that the hospital had saved him.
"If the hospital cannot work," he said, motioning down the row of beds, "then they have no future."
 
Looking for Miracles
 Julio Valle, who is 6, has been told by his father, Bernilio Valle, that the doctors and nurses will take care of him, if they can work miracles.
"But without fuel?" said Dr. Marie Renee Lubin Francisque, the hospital's director. She shakes her head.
The hospital's X-ray machines use an enormous amount of power, but the great concern here is for the medicine. Drugs like insulin and anesthetics have already started to disappear because the fuel shortage has limited the refrigeration need to store them.
Countless other services depend on the fuel, including the most crucial one: food. There is plenty of food in Haiti, relief workers said, but not enough fuel for the trucks that would normally be hauling food all across the country.
CARE, which feeds 590,000 Haitians every day, said it had enough fuel to continue operations until Sept. 3. After that, said Chris Sykes, a spokesman, the resourceful Haitian people will probably find some other way to feed themselves for a few days.
But in the long term, Mr. Sikes said, malnutrition and the diseases that go along with it will begin to settle in. Relief centers take time to set up, he said, and many relief workers could see their apparatus for feeding the poor fall apart if the trucks do not come.
Government officials have said they are waiting only for the proper paper work to come through for arranging the distribution of the fuel. But some relief workers, speaking on the condition that their names not be used, said the Government was playing games. If they really wanted the fuel to be released, the relief workers said, it would already be on its way to the poor.
The embargo, imposed on Haiti to punish the military and their supporters, was supposed to have exempted the delivery of relief supplies so the country's poor would not have to absorb the penalties.
The 500,000 gallons of fuel was intended to carry relief organizations through September and October. Relief workers, afraid of angering the Haitian military, do not openly accuse it of hoarding the fuel.
The Government has said it has fuel reserves to carry it through February 1996, when the term of the exiled President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, expires.
 
Gasoline Very Costly
 On the streets, it can cost as much as $250 to fill a tank with relatively clean gasoline -- much of what is sold in jugs on the street is part water and filled with debris -- and more and more people are walking. The cost of riding in a taxi has more than doubled. Even the rich are complaining.
Some relief workers say the Government is hurting itself by refusing to release the fuel on time.
"People who are hungry are angry," a worker said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
The parents of children in the Grace Hospital are not surprised that the fuel needed to run the country's relief organizations is running out. They expect things like this to happen to them.
"We are poor," Mr. Desama said. "It is only the poor children who die."

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Will Rising Prices of Cars Imperil Detroit's Recovery?

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Aug. 21

 BODY:
The Chrysler Corporation recently rolled out a new compact sedan, the Cirrus, aimed at value-conscious import buyers. Chrysler promises that the car will offer plenty for the money, which means it better offer an awful lot: The base price is an eye-popping $17,970.
Perhaps the most astonishing thing about the price is that it makes the Cirrus one of the cheapest competitors in its segment, which includes the Honda Accord and Nissan Altima. 
 This raises important questions for investors in auto stocks: Are cars becoming too expensive, particularly with interest rates on the rise as the 1995 model-year prices are announced? And will this halt the industry's recovery?
The average car today does take a bigger bite of the average worker's wallet than in the past. In 1993, the average car purchase consumed 25.9 weeks' pay for someone with the median family income of $36,764, compared with 22.5 weeks in 1983 and 17.5 weeks in 1973.
Auto executives typically argue that much of the increase is a result of safety and emissions regulations. Indeed, Robert J. Eaton, chairman and chief executive of Chrysler, said in a recent interview that the company was considering adding a line to a car's sticker stating how much of the price is attributable to government regulations.
The rest of the increase, the executive said, was driven by customer demand. Don Hilty, the chief economist of Chrysler, said that a "constant car" -- a new car built to 1966 specifications -- would use up only 12.4 weeks of pay. Emissions and safety regulations, he said, add 4.8 weeks to that. Bringing the total to 25.9 weeks are 8.7 weeks' worth of options, like air-conditioning, that customers want.
"The cost hasn't gone up," Mr. Hilty said. "The outlay has gone up. People are buying steak instead of hamburger."
But do so many customers really want steak, or are the auto makers pushing it down their throats?
Some analysts said that auto makers were limiting customer choice by making more equipment standard so that they could raise prices. Added features like anti-lock brakes and compact-disk players fatten profit margins. "This upscaling of product really reflects a quest for profit," rather than a pure response to customer demand, said Susan Jacobs, president of Jacobs & Associates, an auto consulting firm in Rutherford, N. J.
The tendency is masked by the way auto makers announce price increases. The auto makers compare prices on a "comparably equipped basis," meaning they factor out the prices of optional equipment on the old model that was made standard on the new one. That tactic has allowed many auto makers to say that their price increases have trailed the Consumer Price Index for years.
For example, because the 1995 Chevrolet Blazer sport-utility vehicle comes with standard air-conditioning, AM-FM radio and other features, General Motors says it costs only 2 percent more than the less-well-equipped 1994 model it replaces.
But to a customer, the price of the basic two-door Blazer has jumped 7.8 percent over the price at the end of the 1994 model year, to $18,630.
Similarly, an analysis by Ms. Jacobs shows the price of a 1995 Ford Taurus GL rose 8.3 percent over the final 1994 price, to $17,585, while the price of a Mitsubishi Eclipse coupe jumped 17.8 percent, to $15,059.
Mr. Hilty of Chrysler said that if customers wanted stripped-down cars with fewer options, an auto maker would have exploited that opportunity. Further, while Chrysler's Cirrus comes fully loaded -- with power windows and locks and even remote keyless entry -- Chrysler plans to offer simpler Dodge and Plymouth versions in 1995 that could sell for less than $14,000.
Other auto analysts agreed that stripped versions of cars do not sell, adding that if customers really need cheap new cars, they can find them. "You can buy a stripped Neon," said Ronald A. Glantz, auto industry analyst for Dean Witter in San Francisco, referring to a Chrysler subcompact. "It's a damn good car, and it's 9,000 bucks."
But the auto makers are sacrificing some sales, Ms. Jacobs said. "Those market opportunities at the lower end of the market are being siphoned off elsewhere -- to the used-car market," she said.
Many auto analysts have argued that the strength of the yen, which has drive up the cost of Japanese goods in the United States, has provided the Big Three with an umbrella for their price increases. But the true umbrella permitting rising prices is leasing. The lower monthly payments required by leasing effectively cut a car's price by 35 to 40 percent, said Art Spinella, vice president and general manager of CNW Marketing/ Research in Bandon, Ore.
Without leasing, Mr. Spinella said, this recovery would barely have occurred. "Last year's increase was almost exclusively because of leasing," he said. "It's equally important this year." Without leasing bringing cash-strapped customers into the market, more than one million cars and trucks out of a 13.9 million market would have gone unsold in 1993, according to CNW's research. In 1994, Mr. Spinella said, that figure is likely to reach 1.4 million.
In the short term, then, investors concerned that rising prices could choke off sales can take comfort from most auto makers' enthusiasm for leasing. Long term, however, leasing poses enormous risks to the companies, which must manage the huge flow of well-maintained off-lease vehicles into the used-car market. Those cars and trucks could drag down used-car prices and present a more affordable alternative to those customers willing to settle for hamburger.

HEADLINE: Texas Challenger Uses Thick Skin and a Smile

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PASADENA, Tex., Aug. 21

 BODY:
George W. Bush did not like it when Ann W. Richards joked to the nation six years ago that his father was "born with a silver foot in his mouth." And he certainly did not like it when Ms. Richards, on the campaign trail the other evening, described him as "some jerk" who was running against her for governor.
But don't look for the 48-year-old Mr. Bush, the Republican nominee, to respond in kind to the tart-tongued Ms. Richards. As he travels around the state, Mr. Bush freely concedes that the incumbent Governor is "an interesting, entertaining person," if, well, a tad abrasive sometimes. 
 "I don't have to erode her likability," Mr. Bush explained the other day on a swing through this refinery town. "I have to erode her electability."
Or, as he later put it even more succinctly, he has been trying to follow some advice from his parents, including a father who knows something about the politics of coming off as a nice guy. "Kill her with kindness," the younger Mr. Bush explained with a grin.
 
Inside Baseball
 It is an uphill battle for the son of the former President, making only his second bid for elective office after losing a Congressional race in West Texas 16 years ago. And his campaign for the highest office in the nation's second-largest state has had its bumpy spots, the latest being, of all things, the baseball strike.
As the managing partner of the Texas Rangers, Mr. Bush's political dream was a World Series starting 17 days before the election and featuring his team, which was first in its division when the strike began, although it was playing below .500 ball. Now he has the makings of a political nightmare on his hands. At some campaign stops, the first question is about the strike.
Nonetheless, Mr. Bush gamely insists that the voters will have good government, educational change and tougher crime measures on their minds, not baseball, when they vote in November. And polls suggest he is well within striking distance of Ms. Richards, a first-term Democrat, with many voters only just beginning to focus on the campaign anyway.
Moreover, he may be buoyed by the political cross-currents in Texas, which is increasingly Republican, last year having sent two Republican senators to Washington for the first time since Reconstruction. It is a state where the elder George Bush is still popular and Bill Clinton is not. And it has an irascible electorate that has not re-elected an incumbent governor in two decades.
Still, the methodical Mr. Bush faces questions about whether he can handle the mayhem of a big campaign down the home stretch this fall, including a likely series of debates with the quick-witted Ms. Richards.
Mr. Bush, facing a dilemma not unlike the one that dogged his father in the 1992 Presidential campaign, is also under increasing pressure from Christian conservatives to take a firm stand on abortion, school prayer and other issues.
The religious right all but took over the state party apparatus at the Republican convention in Fort Worth earlier this summer and produced a party platform that in many respects Mr. Bush has either disavowed or ignored. The conservatives are hardly likely to flock to Ms. Richards, but the degree to which they will actively support Mr. Bush, or to which such support might drive moderates to Ms. Richards, remains to be seen.
And as even Mr. Bush admits, Ms. Richards is generally well liked. One recent set of statewide surveys by Political/Media Research Inc., a national polling concern, suggested that Ms. Richards's favorable rating of 54 percent was well above those of other incumbent governors facing major challenges this fall in big states like California, Florida and New York.
 
Welfare, Schools and Crime
 The state, having taken its worst economic dive in the oil bust of the 1980's, weathered the more recent economic downturn better than either the East or West Coast. Today its economy is far more diversified than it was a decade ago, and many economists point to major growth in its biggest cities and along its 1,200-mile Mexican border because of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
And so the question becomes whether Mr. Bush can get to the Governor's Mansion in Austin by earnestly hammering away at his major campaign themes, which he repeatedly says arise from failures in Ms. Richards's leadership: welfare change, increased autonomy and state financing for local school districts and a crackdown on crime, especially juvenile crime in light of a series of murders committed by young people in the last year.
At a minimum, Mr. Bush's approach has so far provided Texas with a markedly different contest from the one that propelled Ms. Richards to office four years ago.
That was a bitter, tumultuous spectacle of a campaign, in which Ms. Richards's Republican opponent, a West Texas oilman named Clayton Williams, promised supporters he would "head her and hoof her and drag her through the dirt" in a debate. Ms. Richards skillfully took advantage of a series of gaffes by Mr. Williams, including a joke about rape, and when he refused to shake her hand in front of television cameras, she charmed voters with a memorable put-down in a demure, old-girl twang, "Well, I'm sorry you feel that way about it, Clayton."
But there will be none of that hostility in this campaign, Mr. Bush promises, nor will he will try to tar Ms. Richards, as did her primary opponent four years ago, with allegations of illegal drug use to which she refused to respond.
In fact, Mr. Bush said he would not have any response to questions about drug use in his own past. "Maybe I did, maybe I didn't," he told The Houston Chronicle in May. "How I behaved as an irresponsible youth is irrelevant to this campaign."
Another issue that emerged in the rancorous 1990 campaign was past alcohol use, which has also emerged this time, but only as an intriguing illustration of style differences between the two candidates when discussing the matter.
Like Ms. Richards, Mr. Bush admits to drinking too much in past years; unlike Ms. Richards, a fervent supporter of the 12-step approach who has publicly talked about her recovery from alcoholism, Mr. Bush simply says he woke up with a hangover after his 40th birthday and decided to quit drinking, which he did.
 
Stiff, but Reaching Out
 On the campaign trail, Mr. Bush is still widely perceived as a bit stiff in stump speeches, certainly when compared with Ms. Richards, but he appears at ease in smaller groups, as in an appearance at Adella Young Elementary School here in this Houston suburb the other day.
With a group of parents and teachers, he wasted no time launching into an animated and well-received discussion of his plan to give school districts greater autonomy.
And he had no trouble attracting a crowd of very young students, two of whom called him "George Washington," as he read the children's book "The Very Quiet Cricket."
Texas reporters following him the other day were certainly curious about Ms. Richards's remarks to a group of teachers in Texarkana a few days before. "You just work like a dog, do well," she said, "and all of a sudden, you've got some jerk who's running for public office telling everybody it's all a sham and it isn't real. And he doesn't give you credit for doing your job."
But Mr. Bush held back. "The last time I was called a jerk was at Sam Houston Elementary School in Midland, Tex.," he said. "I'm not going to call the Governor names. I'm going to elevate this debate to a level where Texans want it."
Bill Miller, a political consultant in Austin who has worked for candidates from both parties and who is not involved in this campaign, said that Mr. Bush was smart not to engage Ms. Richards on a personal level. "People like her sauciness and her wit," said Mr. Miller. "But he's out there saying, 'I'm closer philosophically to what you want in a governor.' "
Some recent statewide polls have given Ms. Richards a lead of eight percentage points or more, but others have suggested the race to be a statistical dead heat. Early indications of a close race were discounted by pollsters' caveats that many voters might be confusing Mr. Bush with his father; but even as he is increasingly recognized on his own, the younger Mr. Bush has kept pace.

HEADLINE: For Travel Agents, a Tough Life

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
Bobbie Sylvester had been a home economics teacher in Salt Lake City until she decided to become a travel agent 20 years ago. "My best day as a home economics teacher wasn't as good as my worst day as a travel agent," she used to boast.
But now, with people and businesses pinching their travel pennies and with a big decline in the percentage of agency revenue from airline commissions -- the agents' traditional bread and butter -- hundreds, perhaps thousands, of the nation's 32,500 travel agencies are struggling to survive. 
 "It's tougher than ever," said Ms. Sylvester, president of the Rocky Mountain chapter of the American Society of Travel Agents. "What kills you is writing $59 tickets to Boise, because you don't make any money."
 
Earnings Are Less
 Travel agents earn a commission of about 10 percent on every airline ticket they sell. But with the growth of discount airlines and fare wars, that 10 percent is not as much as it used to be. In 1992, airline tickets accounted for 61 percent of travel agency revenues. Now it is thought to be closer to 50 percent and is expected to shrink further.
Much to the furor of some travel agents, some of their services are being taken over by machines. A Florida company, for example, has installed video kiosks in more than 800 pharmacies to help travelers.
And another company says that within a year, it will place 1,000 machines in supermarkets where travelers can pick up tickets.
 
 
The Commission Question
 Many travel agents think they have been chosen as sacrificial lambs as airlines and other companies try to cut costs, even though agencies sell more than 80 percent of all airline tickets. Agents say the airlines have dropped hints that they intend to cut commissions by as much as one-fourth. And they point to a recent move by almost 20 companies, including the General Motors Corporation and the Whirlpool Corporation, to seek lower fares from airlines. Under the proposal, the companies would forfeit frequent-flier miles and would buy tickets through a single clearinghouse, instead of through traditional travel agencies.
Four large travel agencies, including the Carlson Travel Network and US Travel, earned less in air fare commissions last year than in 1992, according to estimates by Travel Weekly magazine. Four other giant agencies, including the 1,500 company-owned properties of American Express, barely exceeded 1992's air sales. And Rosenbluth International, another industry giant, recently laid off 200 employees, almost 7 percent of its payroll, blaming falling air fares in recent months.
Agency revenues could suffer even more if the Justice Department rules that "overrides" -- cash bonuses that airlines give to the travel agents that supply them the most passengers -- offer established carriers an unfair advantage over newer or smaller competitors.
Air fare commissions are airlines' third-biggest expense, behind labor and fuel. Delta Air Lines recently stirred industry wrath by seeming to suggest that it would reduce the traditional 10 percent commission, perhaps to 7.5 percent, as part of its effort to slash expenses by almost 20 percent in the next three years.
While Delta subsequently denied any such intention, it did not rule out the possibility of someday making a change. Meanwhile, Dick Knodt, executive vice president of the American Society of Travel Agents, said that every 1 percent reduction in commissions could put 5,000 small travel agencies out of business.
 
 
'Never Been as Tough'
 At Odyssey Travel in West Chester, Pa., airline commissions have fallen about 35 percent over the last year. "This business has never been as tough as today," said Jutta Goss, the owner. "Everything has suddenly been turned upside down."
Industry woes are reflected in the record 2,820 travel agencies that last year either went out of business or defaulted on payments to the Airlines Reporting Corporation, the industry clearinghouse that provides agents with tickets. The total was double that of five years earlier.
And many agents fear problems will be compounded by the growing use of self-service machines.
Docunet Inc., the San Francisco company that will install airline ticket machines in supermarkets beginning in late October, says its machines will also eventually dispense cash and traveler's checks. And the video kiosks, from the Automated Travel and Health Center, a travel agency in Tampa, Fla., display brochures, photographs and tour prices on color monitors and allow browsers to dial an "800" number for inquiries or to book trips or buy travel insurance.
Travel agencies will still collect a commission from sales made on some automated systems, but will have to pay a fee to the company that owns the machine. In the case of the video kiosks, Automated Travel receives a commission and pays the pharmacies 2 percent on sales and a monthly rental fee.
Individual Thomas Cook Travel agencies will receive commissions from a recently announced computerized speech recognition system that will allow customers to book airline tickets, hotel rooms and rental cars over the telephone 24 hours a day.
But many travel agents, especially the small agencies that dominate the industry, fear that as automated ticketing spreads they will be bypassed.
 
Service Charges on Tickets
 To cushion the effect of lagging commissions, some agents are dusting off an old idea and charging their customers fees of $10 to $25 for time-consuming transactions like writing or reissuing low-cost airline tickets. Travel agents estimate that it costs them about $25 an air ticket.
"We have a $10 service charge per ticket on anything under $100," said Alice Lambie of Apex Travel Service in Brookfield, Wis. Other agencies charge as much as $300 for canceled bookings of elaborate itineraries.
Aware that they can no longer survive mainly by writing tickets, many agencies are emphasizing, as never before, a need to employ specialists on a wide range of travel destinations, from the Grand Ole Opry to the Great Barrier Reef. Many others have developed specialties in niche markets by catering to seniors, art or music aficionados, honeymooners or bird watchers. Some agencies specialize in renting apartments or villas for vacationers to Europe.
More than 800 travel agencies now sell cruises exclusively, and most other agencies now push cruises at every opportunity. Travel agents typically receive a 12 percent commission to book a cruise, and unlike a discount airline ticket, cruises are not cheap. A cruise averages about $200 a day, per person, including round-trip air fare. Seven-day cruises to the Caribbean can easily cost $5,000 a couple.
"Twice a year we hold seminars where clients can come listen to officials," said Virginia Cobb of Cobb Travel in Birmingham, Ala. "We end up with many bookings. The last time we had 250 people attend, and 70 percent of them booked. A few years ago we had 85 people on a Cunard cruise to the Canary Islands."
Cruises are time consuming for agents, Ms. Cobb added, "but you can make good money selling them."
Another striking industry change is the speed with which many large travel agencies, with a preponderance of volatile business accounts, are now seeking more leisure customers. These agencies include Uni-globe Travel International, with more than 1,000 franchise locations, which hopes to change its mix of 70 percent business travel and 30 percent leisure travel to a 50-50 split, largely by focusing on selling cruises. Northwestern Travel Service, a $305 million company, hopes to change its mix from 80 percent corporate to 60.
To be sure, travel agents have had to cope with change ever since Thomas Cook, a one-time temperance missionary, founded his travel agency in England in the mid-19th century to escort well-heeled ladies and gentlemen on grand tours of the Continent.
"But rarely has major structural change come so fast and so furiously, with more on the way," said William Chiles, president of Hickory Travel Systems, a consortium of more than 100 agencies. "Agencies," he warned, "will either adapt or disappear."

HEADLINE: The Nuclear Black Market

 BODY:
Recent reports that German police have intercepted small amounts of nuclear material on Europe's black market are a chilling reminder that the end of the cold war brings no guarantee of nuclear safety. Indeed, the disintegration of the former Soviet Union with its huge stockpiles of weapons and nuclear materials may actually make the world more dangerous than it was when such materials were under police-state control.
Surely there is no more urgent task before the world's governments than eradicating this embryonic trade. Yet Russia resists, and the Clinton Administration has been slow to press the issue. 
 The materials intercepted in four recent incidents by German authorities were not in themselves a weapon threat -- the amounts of plutonium and highly enriched uranium were too small and too impure to make a bomb. What is unnerving is that these small amounts appear to have been samples designed to generate future sales of larger amounts to foreign countries or terrorist groups eager to make nuclear weapons.
There is no evidence yet that any warheads or enough material for a bomb have actually been spirited out of Russia. But German officials were right to sound the alarm. The known seizures could be a mere fraction of the dangerous traffic.
The former Soviet Union relied on physical security at installations and close monitoring of its population to prevent anyone from making off with nuclear materials. But with the police state now gone, criminal gangs proliferating and social turbulence rising, conditions seem ripe for thefts.
The most immediate need is for intensified police work to intercept smugglers. That will require an unusual degree of cooperation among police and intelligence agencies in Europe and the former Soviet Union, with help from the U.S.
Stronger protective measures are also required at all military and civilian nuclear sites in the former Soviet bloc. At a minimum there must be an accurate inventory; even Russian officials acknowledge they have lost track of who possesses what nuclear material.
Only the Russians can truly fix the security breakdown, and they are sending mixed signals. President Boris Yeltsin has promised to block the trade in nuclear contraband, and many Russian officials seem eager to upgrade security. But nationalist politicians and many atomic energy officials in Russia dismiss the concerns as Western propaganda. Unless responsible leaders prevail, the task appears hopeless.
Securing Russia's nuclear stockpiles is a matter of great urgency. Yet the Clinton Administration, distracted by domestic battles and other foreign crises, has given it only fitful attention. No high-level official is working on the problem full time, and diplomacy is going very slowly. As the President prepares for a meeting with Mr. Yeltsin in September, there is no more important issue for the White House to engage.

HEADLINE: No Field of Dreams at Baseball Assembly Plant

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The strike by major league baseball players on so-stated "philosophic" grounds, to protect the interests of future colleagues, exemplifies the enormous disparity in compensation for services and freedom of action in today's world. While a Bobby Bonilla makes $10,000 for every at bat, the women who assemble the baseballs he either hits or misses earn about two cents per ball. 
 According to data compiled by the National Labor Committee for Worker and Human Rights in Central America, these women must stitch a quota of some 48 baseballs or softballs a day and earn $1.07 for a workday of 10 1/2 hours on their feet. They work for Wilson, the supplier for the National League, which until very recently had a baseball assembly plant in Haiti, for Star Sports Inc. and three other United States companies that are allowed to trade with Haiti despite the embargo imposed by the Organization of American States.
The treatment of women workers in baseball assembly plants in Haiti and in Central America has long been a concern. Unions, or even talk of unions, are forbidden and grounds for dismissal. Inspection of these plants by outsiders has long been prohibited.
The argument given for this continued exploitation has been that if Wilson and the others were not employing the poor, the poor would have no share at all in the economy.
The philosophical concerns of the players' union might well also embrace the lives of the poor in the third world who make possible the game that earns them an average salary of $1.2 million a year.
It would shatter people's perceptions of professional ballplayers as grasping, self-interested individuals to see the players form a committee to visit the plants in Haiti and elsewhere during this interim period to study working conditions. Would even they be forbidden entrance and contact with workers?
After striking the owners, such a visit might give the major league players grounds for striking Wilson et al. too and lead to the ending of the salary cap for Haitian and other workers.

Suburban Office Space

 BODY:
Helped by an improving economy, the commercial real estate market in New York City's suburbs has begun to emerge from its recession, real estate brokers say. Asking rents for office space have bottomed out and vacancy rates have started to fall. With rising prices in Manhattan, companies could once again begin looking to the suburbs for office space, but the tightening of markets in New Jersey and on Long Island means most growth in those areas should continue to come from the expansion of local businesses. Westchester is still very attractive to large companies because there are more large blocks of space available. The Equitable Life Assurance Society and MasterCard are two companies looking for space in the county.

HEADLINE: For Japan, a Growing Deficit in Foreign Visitors

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Aug. 20

 BODY:
Dressed in T-shirts, shorts and sunglasses, Mike and Jo Ozimek of Philadelphia were strolling recently along the Ginza, Tokyo's glitziest shopping district. Mr. Ozimek described Japan as the safest and most interesting country in East Asia, and said he would love to live here. It was his fifth visit and his wife's first.
But Mr. Ozimek admitted that he would probably never have come to know Japan if his job with a computer company had not brought him here on business trips, like this one. And Mrs. Ozimek said that, while she was enjoying the trip to a country she had hardly given a thought to visiting before, she was intimidated by the $400 cost of a brief visit to Mount Fuji, a little more than an hour away. 
 Their experience is hardly unique. Japan is in the heart of its summer vacation season, a paralyzing ritual of mobbed airports, train stations and roadways. But there is a serious problem with this mass peregrination -- the travelers are almost all Japanese. Few foreigners come to Japan, and lately the number has been dropping.
 
Political Difficulties
 That is a politically uncomfortable fact for a country that complains incessantly that it is misunderstood. Japanese officials insist that their country, though it has the world's largest trade surplus, would be viewed as something other than a predatory economic animal if foreigners only took the time to get to know it better.
For reasons from the astronomical costs in Japan and the lack of interest in the West to the difficulty of obtaining student visas, getting acquainted has not proven easy.
More than 13 million Japanese are expected to travel abroad this year -- triple the level of a decade ago -- as the Japanese have become, and have felt, more affluent.
Japan is expected to receive only about 3 million foreign visitors, the second year in a row that the total has declined, at least in part because costs have risen even higher with the soaring value of the yen. Japan, with a population of 124.3 million people, is the third most populous nation in East Asia and economically the largest, yet it ranks just 25th as an international destination, well behind China, Thailand and even the minuscule Portuguese colony of Macao, near Hong Kong.
 
Not Many U.S. Students Either
 With students, the story is similar. Japan sends abroad roughly double the number of students it takes in every year, despite a nearly decade-long campaign to balance the figures because of the increasingly important political need to make Japan better-liked abroad.
The imbalance with the United States is even worse. A total of 42,840 Japanese studied in American schools last year, a steep rise from 18,050 in 1988. Japan, however, was host to fewer than 2,000 Americans. According to a recent study by the Laurasian Institution, an educational exchange organization, the number of American undergraduates here was 1,423 and has been dropping for two years.
There are more than 5,000 American students in the United Kingdom, more than 4,000 in Germany and more than 3,500 in France. Foreign students make up nearly 3 percent of students in the United States, but less than 1 percent in Japan.
This is, in short, one of the least known but most tenacious imbalances in Japan's dealings with the world, and one that officials worry could carry the most negative long-term implications. "This conveys the impression to foreign countries that Japan is a closed country, even in the cultural sphere," a high-level advisory body reported to the Prime Minister in a study released in June.
The paucity of such exchanges is one reason why Japan often feels like an intimate stranger to Americans, a massive presence in the statistical records, but a curiosity in the popular imagination.
The advisory group recommended tax incentives to the private sector to encourage it to play a greater role in bringing foreign students and workers to Japan and that the difficult procedures for establishing nonprofit organizations that arrange exchanges be eased.
 
Government's Efforts Faulted
 The report was tough in its criticism of the branches of Government that promote exchanges, like the Japan Foundation, and suggested that they be doubled in size during the next few years and that their budgets be increased sharply. It also encouraged development of a database of information on exchange programs.
The report also called for more housing for foreign students, more language courses, simpler visa procedures and more money for scholarships.
"Japan has to establish itself as a cultural country, not just an economic giant," said Akito Arima, the former president of Japan's leading university, Tokyo University, and head of the advisory committee. "Japan's whole raison d'etre must change. France is a country of arts and culture. Why not Japan?"
No one doubts that a big part of the problem rests in the United States and other foreign countries. Few Americans learn Japanese and courses in Japanese history or culture have generally not been popular at Western universities. Culturally, Americans tend to feel more connected with Europe, despite the fact that Japan is America's largest overseas trading partner and the critical link in America's Pacific defense strategy.
 
Tokyo Is No Paris
 Even when costs in Japan were far lower, few Americans came here. And while the distance is great, that does not deter Americans from visiting China, for instance, in greater numbers.
Many Americans benefit from studying here, but for some, coming to Japan is the opposite of the dreamy experience many enjoy in Europe.
"When you're in Paris, it's the expatriate American in Paris thing; it's great," said Robert Rosin, 24, who has studied in both Japan and France. "In Japan, it's completely different. You're struggling for your life it seems. It's not easy."
He said he ran into real estate agents or landlords who refused to rent to foreigners, and he found costs a burden. Mr. Rosin admitted, though, that ignorance and indifference in the United States were factors. "When people found out I had studied here they would wonder how I learned about Japan and how I did it," said Mr. Rosin, who will soon begin working here for the Sony Corp.
Mr. Arima said he felt the problem represented something close to a crisis for Japan. But he expressed little hope that the situation could be corrected quickly.
"One big reason is very simple, language," he said. "English is a universal language. Japanese is not. This is a serious problem that will not go away."
But he said that he puts much of the blame on the Government. "The infrastructure for foreigners in Japan is still very primitive, especially in the bigger cities," said Mr. Arima, a nuclear physicist who studied abroad himself. "I tried to build up our facilities at Tokyo University for foreigners. But they were still too small."
 
An Economic Function
 To some degree, the imbalance is clearly a matter of intention, though this is little discussed. When Japan sends more visitors abroad than it receives, money flows out of the country. In other words, Japanese spend abroad more than visiting tourists spend in Japan. This travel deficit amounted to $23.3 billion last year.
Economically, that was significant, since it reduced Japan's yawning surplus in the broadest measure of trade, known as the current account. The current account includes both trade in manufactured goods and trade in services, including areas like tourism, banking and insurance.
Those flows have had a big impact on the travel business, which generally regards efforts to lure Americans as a waste. However, huge efforts are made to send tour groups from Japan to such popular destinations as Hawaii and Guam.
"For Japanese there is no doubt, the United States is a kind of dream destination," said Fumio Kanaya, a deputy general manager at the Japan Travel Bureau, the country's largest agency. "But it's not the same for Americans. Americans usually come here on business."

HEADLINE: FLIGHT FROM CUBA: The Policy;
Cuba Strategy: Reactive or Planned?

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 22

 BODY:
The way Administration officials tell it, their new policy toward Cuba has two straightforward goals: stopping the flood of refugees and pressuring Fidel Castro to take meaningful steps toward democracy and a free market.
With Cuba's economy in a shambles and with Mr. Castro facing the most dissent in years, it is an opportune time to get Mr. Castro to bend to outside pressures, Administration officials say. 
 While these officials insist that the new strategy grew out of a lengthy policy review, foreign policy experts say it has been awkwardly improvised ever since the the flood of refugees appeared on the horizon two-and-a-half weeks ago. Hardly a day has gone by without a new policy offshoot or without one Administration official making a statement that seems to contradict that of another.
So far, many foreign policy experts say, much of the new policy -- abandoning automatic asylum for Cubans and tightening economic sanctions -- appears to be in response to short-term domestic considerations, without recognizing the potential long-term consequences. In this respect, these experts say that the Administration's short-term focus is little different from its strategies toward Haiti and Somalia.
 
Will Sanctions Increase Flow?
 One big concern is that the tougher sanctions the White House imposed last weekend will cause more misery or a violent eruption in Cuba, encouraging tens of thousands more refugees to go to sea -- precisely what the Administration is trying to prevent.
White House officials say their policy aims not to topple Mr. Castro but to pressure him to embrace reforms. But Gillian Gunn, director of Georgetown University's Cuba Project, and many other experts assert that Mr. Castro will never agree to reform if the United States keeps his back pinned against the wall. Mr. Castro is too shrewd to consent to free elections if Cuba's economy is so wretched that he is bound to lose, they argue.
Despite the Administration's professed policy of seeking peaceful change in Cuba, many experts say the likely result of the toughened sanctions will be to foment violence by making the anti-Castro opposition more desperate.
"This whole policy seems to be drawn up hastily, without consulting experts within the Administration who can warn them about what they're doing," Ms. Gunn, of the Cuba Project, said in an interview. "This policy will either lead to a stalemate in which Castro remains in power, but the Cuban people suffer more and migration pressures rise, or it will lead to some kind of instability and uprising, which could lead to American intervention and a huge outflow of refugees."
Whatever the Administration's policy objectives may be, the President revised his Cuba policy in direct response to pleas from Florida's Democratic Governor, Lawton Chiles, who faces a tough re-election battle this fall. Mr. Clinton's political team worried that a tidal wave of refugees could cause the Democrats to lose the governor's mansion in Florida this fall and cause Mr. Clinton problems in the fourth most populous state in 1996.
Responding to Governor Chiles's appeals, Attorney General Janet Reno announced in an unusual late-night news conference an end to the 28-year-old practice of welcoming virtually all Cubans.
Even for an Administration long accused of flip-flopping, her announcement seemed extraordinary because that very morning, she had told reporters that the refugee situation was under control and no change in refugee policy was under consideration. Administration officials explained her about-face as a response to the surge in Cuban refugees, but it was widely read as an attempt at political damage control in Florida.
While that policy reversal aimed to comfort Floridians worried about a flood of refugees, it created another problem: many Cuban-Americans were angered. They protested against sending Cubans back to the navy base on Guantanamo Bay.
Two days later, as if to placate the Cuban-Americans, the Administration tried to show that the new policy would hurt not just fleeing Cubans, but also Mr. Castro. President Clinton announced tougher sanctions: more anti-Castro broadcasts, steps to prevent Cuban-Americans from sending cash to Cuba, and reducing charter flights.
"It's troubling that the whole process seems not to be driven by humanitarian motives or by any serious foreign policy consideration, but by narrow political calculations, following pretty much what hard-liners in the Cuban-American community demanded," said Peter Hakim, president of Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington-based research institute on hemispheric issues. "It increases the danger of a less peaceful, less satisfactory transition to a post-Castro Government."
Like many experts, he predicted the sanctions would worsen the lot of most Cubans: the very people the Administration wants to help. To this criticism, a White House official responded that as is usually the case with sanctions, the masses have to be squeezed somewhat if the regime is to be pressured.
 
How Long at Guantanamo?
 Showing just how much extemporizing the Administration is doing, Mr. Clinton's aides admit they have no idea how long the Cubans intercepted by the Coast Guard will be detained at Guantanamo Bay or where they will go next.
Last Friday, Ms. Reno said the refugees would be held there "short-term" before being taken to safe havens in third countries. But in a news conference today, Defense Secretary William Perry said the refugees would be held at Guantanamo Bay "indefinitely."
The Administration seems to be improvising so openly because its new policy has not elicited the anticipated response. When the President ordered the Coast Guard to detain fleeing Haitians in Guantanamo Bay rather than grant them interviews for asylum, the flood of Haitians slowed to a trickle.
But the Cubans keep going to sea in record numbers even though the welcome mat has been withdrawn. With the Cuban exodus climbing to new highs today, Administration officials were scrambling to ask Caribbean countries to provide safe havens to hold the overflow of Cubans.
The Cubans keep streaming onto flimsy rafts for a reason that has often plagued President Clinton: a lack of credibility on foreign policy. Many fleeing Cubans simply do not believe President Clinton's assertion that they they won't be allowed into the United States.
These people are convinced that their cousins or step-brothers in Miami will somehow arrange for them to be moved from Guantanamo to Florida -- and ultimately to American citizenship.

HEADLINE: Border Crossings;
Migration for Work and Play Is Binding a Working-Class Village to a Gilded Neighbor

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PORT CHESTER, N.Y., Aug. 22

 BODY:
Luis Lopez had long wanted to open a Mexican restaurant in Rye, confident that there was a fortune to be made in that gilded community of country clubs, estates and, more important, disposable wealth.
But after discovering the high rents for commercial space there, he opened his restaurant just a few steps from the Rye border in this scruffy harbor village on Long Island Sound, where he has slowly tapped the Rye market. 
 "I wanted to be near where the rich people are," said Mr. Lopez, whose restaurant, El Coyote Flaco on Midland Avenue, offers a menu of low-fat specialties meant to entice the health-conscious gentry. "My plan was to draw these kind of American customers and acquaint them with quality Hispanic foods."
His strategy suggests the unusual ties between Rye and Port Chester -- a kind of cross-pollination between two strikingly different communities: one made up largely of affluent white residents, the other increasingly of working-class immigrants, many from Latin America. It is a union of expedience that, with occasional exceptions, has led to cooperation in many areas, from government and commerce to the arts, entertainment, education and recreation.
As Jan Kelsy, a local historian from Rye, put it: "Both of these communities have evolved differently, but they're tied together in many ways. There's always been a flow back and forth between them."
Teeming with a cluster of ethnic groceries and herbal shops, Hispanic restaurants, a leather craftsman and other mom-and-pop ventures, Port Chester has become something of a magnet for well-heeled Rye residents seeking the exotica of the village's downtown.
But the relationship runs the other way as well. Rye provides a wealth of jobs in housekeeping, gardening, baby-sitting and the like to many South and Central American immigrants who have come to this suburb in search of opportunities.
"We could not find this much work in our country," said a 22-year-old gardener from El Salvador who identified himself only as Manuel. "We are fortunate that there are people who need workers like us."
There is also a small circle of artists and other intellectuals from Rye (as well as other Westchester County communities) who have begun using Port Chester's vacant factories and other commercial spaces as studios and galleries.
"There's a commonality between these communities," said Mike Graessle, the village manager for Port Chester. "There's an enrichment that they share in commercial experiences, cultural experiences and recreational experiences."
But there have been tensions as well.
For years, both were villages governed by the larger Town of Rye. But in 1942, residents in the village of Rye broke away by incorporating as a city, in part because of complaints that a disproportionate share of local taxes was going to services in Port Chester.
To this day, many in Port Chester feel their village is regarded with more than a little bit of derision.
"Port Chester is very maligned," said Randy Solomon, who grew up in Port Chester but now lives in Rye Brook. "It's very easy for people to look down on Port Chester because it's a blue-collar community."
The most recent standoff between Port Chester and Rye came several months ago, when Home Depot, a home-improvement retailer, proposed a sprawling store on Midland Avenue in Port Chester, near the Rye border.
Saying the new store would bring traffic, noise and pollution, a group of Rye residents waged a campaign against the proposal, even mounting a successful court challenge. But Port Chester officials and many residents have supported it as a way to bolster the sagging economy of a village that has lost major employers like the Life Savers candy factory. A revised proposal by Home Depot is expected soon by Port Chester officials.
Port Chester residents were angered by the Rye campaign because they felt their village had far more at stake than Rye, a community where the median family income is $86,000 a year, more than double what families in Port Chester make, according to the 1990 Census.
Regardless of that disparity, many in Port Chester are proud that this village of 25,000 has maintained its character as a gritty, bare-knuckle enclave in a region that is far from that.
"The elite have always been in Rye," said Goldie Solomon, a lifelong Port Chester resident who is president of the village's historical society. "But Port Chester is like the hub on a wheel, an industrial community that's always provided the blue-collar labor for its neighbors."
No place illustrates the interdependence between the two communities more than Port Chester's downtown, where day laborers cluster on street corners waiting to be hired for jobs, very often in Rye, and where many merchants say they try to cater to the tastes of customers from Rye.
"We are all interested in keeping the image of this community up, so that people from Rye and all over keep coming," said George Kanlonj, an Ecuadorean immigrant who owns one of the 84 Salvadoran, Mexican, Peruvian, Italian and other ethnic restaurants in Port Chester's downtown.
One of the people who has come to Port Chester from Rye is Anne Barringer Spaeth. When she decided to open an avant-garde bookstore, she looked past obvious spots in her own community, whose main drag is dominated by coffee shops, ice-cream parlors and upscale boutiques, and chose a vacant storefront on North Main Street in Port Chester.
There, she sells the works of Hispanic authors like Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Octavia Paz as well as self-help books focusing on alcoholism and domestic violence, published in both Spanish and English.
 
Cross-Pollination
 But she says her decision to open the shop in Port Chester goes well beyond the business of selling books. The bookstore, called Panacea, has been the site of voter registration and a forum for musicians, authors and poets.
"I now have the ability to cross-fertilize and get people to know each other," Mrs. Barringer Spaeth said, noting that her mailing list of 1,000 includes people not only from Port Chester but also from her own community and others.
To many, such efforts have helped bridge a cultural divide. Guillermo Brown, a young drummer from Port Chester, and his quartet recently appeared at the bookstore to play jazz standards for an audience that was anything but standard.
"We got to reach a real cross-section of people at the bookstore," said Mr. Brown, 18. "Reaching out to people in music is really what we're interested in."
The crossing of these disparate worlds has also helped turn misfortune into fortune. One example is the Simon Building, a five-story former factory on Irving Avenue that had many vacancies before a group of artists packed up their easels, brushes and paints and moved their studios there.
Janet Levine, a painter and sculptor from Rye, relocated her studio to the fourth floor of the building about seven years ago, along with a handful of other artists.
"There weren't that many of us in the building back then," Mrs. Levine said. "But today, we may have as many as 40 to 50 artists in the building."
On occasion, she said, the artists have opened the studios to visitors, offering the artists an opportunity to gauge how people from all walks of life react to their work.
"It's an interesting experience because you're looking for as many different types of responses as you can get," she said.
"Port Chester is special in that it hasn't been totally gentrified," she said. "It's got a nice mixture. There are so many different kinds of stores and people. You make a lot of interesting discoveries.
And, she added, "It's only minutes away from home."

With little in common, Rye, a wealthy Westchester County community, and Port Chester, its working-class neighbor, have long been interdependent.

And people from Rye come to Port Chester to try the restaurants and explore the shops and art galleries that its lower rents have attracted.

U.S. Bonds Fall Along With Dollar

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities sagged yesterday, as bonds moved in tandem with the dollar's decline in world currency markets. Traders said that the absence of new economic data or major events left the spotlight on currency.
According to analysts, the dollar's decline against the yen has been sparked by fears that the United State and Japan will not be able to settle their differences about reducing Japan's huge trade surplus with America. 
 Traders said the coming supply of Treasury issues might also have been a factor in putting pressure yesterday on the prices of shorter-term maturities. This week, the Treasury will be auctioning $28.25 billion of new two-year and five-year notes. Analysts expect, however, that supply will lighten considerably after the auctions.
The 30-year bond fell 25/32 of a point, to 9913/32 , for a yield of 7.55 percent, up from 7.49 percent on Friday. All the sharp gains made after last week's rate increase by the Federal Reserve have now disappeared.
 
 
Concern Over Rates
 Traders said investors were growing concerned about another interest rate rise by the Fed, even though many analysts do not expect the Fed to lift interest rates again until after the November elections. Charles Roden, managing director and head of fixed-income investing at Josephthal, Lyon & Ross, said the conversation among trading desks yesterday was about the chances of another rate increase.
In addition, with the dollar down, fewer foreign investors may want to chance buying Treasuries for fear of seeing their investment erode.
Mr. Roden said he was starting to see the flow of new money coming into the market, but it was gravitating toward to the shorter maturities because of the higher returns created by recent Fed interest rate jumps. This, in turn, is putting pressure on the longer end of the market, he believes.
In when-issued trading, the two-year note, which will be auctioned today, was trading at a price to yield 6.30 percent, while the five-year to be auctioned tomorrow was trading at a price to yield 6.98 percent.
Yesterday, the Treasury held its regular weekly auction of new three-month and six-month bills, with rate results on the mixed side. The average rate for a three-month bill was 4.62 percent, up from 4.59 percent last week. Traders said it was the highest rate in nearly three years.
For the six-month Treasury bill at auction, the average rate was 4.98 percent, one basis point under last week's rate. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
 
 
'Good Shape'
 There are expectations that this week's auctions will do well, in part because the threat of an interest rate rise is off until the fall. But there are those like George Mateyo, who manages $3 billion in investment at Carnegie Capital Management in Cleveland, who believes yields will not come down anytime soon because the Fed, he thinks, will be forced to raise rates at least once more before the end of the year. "The economy's growing too fast to slow down without another rate increase," he said.
"The economy's in good shape, and as a consequence inflation is bound to rise," Mr. Mateyo added.
But not everybody sees rapid economic growth. Ray Worseck, chief economist and manager at A. G. Edwards & Sons, said that final sales of goods and services were rising more slowly, and the economy appeared to have shifted from a phase in which economic momentum was accelerating to a phase in which it was waning.
He said that during the second quarter the output of the economy, as measured by real gross domestic product, increased at a 3.7 percent annual rate. On the surface, that looked strong, he said. However, Mr. Worseck added that much of the increase in output did not get sold and instead accumulated on retailers' shelves as inventories, which means production could now begin to slow down.
In the municipal market, which has also been adversely affected by the drop Government securities prices, many tax-exempt investors have put off purchases.
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new three- and six-month bills:

Both issues are dated Aug. 25, 1994. The three-month bills mature on Nov. 25, 1994, and the six-month bills mature on Feb. 23, 1995.

Concern About Trade Talks Sends Dollar Lower vs. Yen

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar tumbled to a five-week low against the yen yesterday as traders grew more pessimistic about progress in trade talks between the United States and Japan.
Losses against the yen helped drag the dollar lower against the German mark and other leading currencies, traders said. The dollar fell to 97.71 yen, its lowest level since July 18, before settling at 97.85 yen in late New York trading, down from 98.65 yen on Friday. It fell to a six-week low of 1.5264 marks before settling at 1.5288 marks, down from 1.5396 marks on Friday. 
 The dollar's latest slide against the yen started on Thursday after the Commerce Department said the United States trade deficit with Japan widened to $5.518 billion in June. The trade report came two days after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates, a move that usually bolsters the dollar's value by making dollar-denominated assets more attractive to investors.
But the swollen trade deficit means that Japanese exporters have a wealth of dollars to sell for yen when they bring revenues home, depressing the value of the dollar.
"The focus in the currency market is back on Japan's trade surplus," said Frank Pusateri, a vice president at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh. "It's looking like trade war time."
Amy Smith, senior currency market strategist at IDEA, a consulting firm, said she expected the dollar to face a "difficult September" against the yen as a deadline for progress in the trade talks drew closer. The United States set a deadline of Sept. 30 for negotiations aimed at getting Japanese Government agencies to buy more American goods.
 
Strength in the Peso
 The Mexican peso, meanwhile, rallied to a three-month high against the dollar after preliminary results showed that Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, the candidate of the Institutional Revolutionary Party won Mexico's presidency in Sunday's elections.
The election prompted investors to buy Mexican assets, for which they needed pesos, said Guillermo Estebanez, senior economist at Bank of America in San Francisco.
The peso closed the day at 3.3375 to the dollar, its highest level since June 6, and stronger than Friday's 3.3575 pesos.
The peso slipped from the day's highs after the Mexican central bank told currency traders that it would buy dollars if the peso reached 3.25 pesos to the dollar, to limit big swings in the currency market -- even swings that benefit the peso.

HEADLINE: Dow Eases 3.89 as Traders Show Caution

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
Worried by the dollar's continuing fall, despite a rate increase by the Federal Reserve that should have raised its value, stock traders pulled back sharply from trading yesterday.
The leading stock indexes closed essentially unchanged, while bonds fell with the declining dollar. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 3.89 points, to 3,751.22, and the broader Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 1.36 point, to 462.32. The smaller-company Nasdaq composite index fell 0.14 point, to 742.29.
Even for typically quiet Mondays, trading volume was restrained. About 236 million shares changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange, or 17 percent below this year's average of 285 million shares and below even the more restrained trading average of the third quarter of 259 million shares.
 
Movement in Bond Prices
 Bond prices followed the fate of the dollar but did not closely track stocks. The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell, yielding 7.55 percent, up from 7.49 percent.
Last week's half-point increase in short-term rates by the Fed ought to have made dollar-denominated assets, like stocks and bonds, more attractive to investors, especially foreigners.
Instead, the dollar has fallen in three of the last four sessions against the Japanese yen and four out of four sessions against the German mark. Yesterday, the dollar fell to 97.85 yen from 98.65 yen and plunged as low as 97.71 yen. The dollar also fell to 1.5288 marks, from 1.5396 marks on Friday.
Currency traders cited continuing pessimism that trade talks between the United States and Japan would reduce the $60 billion United States trade deficit. By exporting to the United States more than it imports and by selling the resulting dollars rather than investing them in American goods and services, Japan tends to depress the value of the dollar and strengthen that of the yen.
While the trade deficit persists, the Fed's interest rate moves will likely have little effect on the currency markets because currency traders are more often moved by their own speculation rather than assessment of economic conditions.
Currency traders also cite relatively attractive German interest rates, which do not seem to be coming down soon, and stable American rates, which may not rise again until after the Congressional elections in November.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 0.54 point, to 255.27, with advancing stocks lagging behind declining stocks by 922 to 1,238. The American Stock Exchange market value index rose 0.32 point, to 445.77.
 
Dow Industrial Stocks
 Of the 30 component stocks that make up the Dow industrials, 17 fell, led by Boeing, which dropped 7/8, to 44 1/8, following newspaper reports of defense budget cutbacks that would hurt contractors like Boeing.
Of the 500 component stocks that make up the S.& P. 500, 276 fell, led by General Motors, which fell 3/4, to 48 3/8, despite trade reports that G.M. would make more cars than Japan this year, for the first time since 1980.
There were other notable stocks. LDDS Communications fell 3/4, to 231/16 , after announcing plans to buy Wiltel, the long-distance telephone network, from the Williams Companies for $2.5 billion.
Johnson & Johnson rose 1/8, to 49 1/8, after it announced plans to buy Neutrogena for nearly $1 billion. And Novell dropped 1 1/8, to 14, after the software developer warned that third-quarter earnings would be below expectations. Wordperfect, recently acquired by Novell, will likely hurt Novell's earnings, Novell said.

HEADLINE: LDDS to Purchase Wiltel for $2.5 Billion

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: DALLAS, Aug. 22

 BODY:
LDDS Communications Inc., striving to turn the Big Three of long-distance telephone service into the Big Four, agreed today to buy the Williams Companies' national fiber optic network for $2.5 billion in cash.
In acquiring Wiltel, the Williams telecommunications unit, LDDS would join AT&T, MCI Communications and Sprint in having its own network. Owning a network, instead of leasing capacity, will cut LDDS's costs and allow it to reach for major corporate customers, analysts said. 
 "In order to position themselves to be a full-fledged No. 4 competitor,' said Stuart Conrad, an analyst at C. J. Lawrence/Deutsche Bank Securities, "they had to do a Wiltel type of deal.'
Just three weeks ago, LDDS bounded into the international long-distance market with its agreement to buy IDB Communications Group Inc. for $900 million in stock and the assumption of debt.
LDDS now has about 3 percent of the $64 billion United States long-distance market. The extra two percentage points gained by the two acquisitions would still leave LDDS well behind AT&T's 59 percent of the market, MCI's 19 percent and Sprint's 10 percent.
Although Wiltel already serves many large companies, some analysts wonder how many more corporate accounts LDDS can take from its rivals.
The deal ends an ardent, sometimes fractious, four-month pursuit of Wiltel by Bernard J. Ebbers, the chief executive of LDDS.
"Wiltel is recognized as a leading 'carrier's carrier,' " Mr. Ebbers said in a statement, "but it is also well recognized for its development of leading-edge technology for larger telecommunications users.'
Mr. Ebbers initially offered Keith E. Bailey, his Williams counterpart, $2 billion in person on April 6. With no response from the company a month later, Mr. Ebbers increased the pressure by publicizing his offer.
The Williams board, loath to part with a business growing far more rapidly than its larger natural gas divisions, soon rejected it. But even as Williams executives loudly proclaimed their intent to stay in the telecommunications business, the board told them to keep talking with LDDS and other possible buyers, several of them foreign.
LDDS will buy only the Wiltel fiber optics network, leaving Williams with two much smaller operations, in telecommunications service and equipment and in video transmission. LDDS will leave its new unit in Tulsa, Okla., where Williams is based.
 
Cables in Pipelines
 Williams plans to use as much as $800 million of the sale proceeds to buy back its stock over the next 12 months, and the rest for investments in the energy field. After taxes and other costs, Williams expects to receive $1.6 billion, including a gain of at least $950 million.
These amounts represent the returns on a business Williams began only in 1986 by threading fiber optic cables through its abandoned natural gas pipelines and along other pipelines still in use.
Shares of Williams, having risen from the low $20's since early April in anticipation of the Wiltel sale, fell 25 cents today, to $31.25, on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares of LDDS fell 75 cents, to $23.0625, in Nasdaq trading, on news that had been expected. Analysts said the $2.5 billion price was a windfall for Williams but would ultimately be worth it for LDDS.
In a telephone conference today, Mr. Bailey tussled with some analysts and investors, including Leon Cooperman, a hedge-fund manager, who questioned how well Williams would be able to deploy the proceeds.
Mr. Bailey said the Wiltel video network, which Williams will keep, had the potential to grow as rapidly as the telecommunications network being sold. "We've been as successful as anyone in the business with respect to building value in the long-distance business,' he said. "We have the potential to be as successful as anyone in the video media business."
 
Hurdle for a Growing Company
 LDDS, based in Jackson, Miss., has grown rapidly through acquisitions since Mr. Ebbers became one of the original investors in 1983. John W. Kluge, the billionaire investor, gained about 19 percent of LDDS's stock when his Metromedia Communications merged with LDDS last September.
But LDDS has remained only a marketer, packager and paperwork handler for telephone service provided on network capacity leased from other companies, including Wiltel. Without the economies of its own network, LDDS has concentrated on serving small and medium-sized businesses.
These businesses are likely to be the first quarry of the regional Bell companies, should they win permission to enter the long-distance market in the next several years.
Several analysts said LDDS might then be swallowed up itself. "I don't think there's any question that this asset is for sale,' said Craig Ellis, an analyst at Wheat First Butcher Singer. He added that Mr. Kluge already had close ties to the regional Bells.
In a brief interview, Mr. Ebbers said his company would also expand its efforts to win residential business. "If you are creditworthy," he said, "you could be getting a call from a company that represents LDDS."
The Wiltel purchase, to be financed by a group of banks, is subject to Federal and state approvals, which the companies expect by the end of the year.

HEADLINE: A Russian Bottled Water With a Saintly Twist

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: KOSTROMA, Russia

 BODY:
In earlier times, it might have been considered an unholy alliance, but the Russian Orthodox Church is working with a California businessman in a joint venture to bottle natural water from the Saint Springs for sale in Russia and soon the United States.
"New times," Archbishop Aleksandr explained as he briskly led an inspection tour of the bottling plant. The Archbishop, who led the effort to turn the output of the church's natural spring into Russia's only domestically bottled still water, said he expected to turn a profit this fall. 
 "We need a lot of money to restore what was lost," the Archbishop said, referring to seven decades of Communist persecution of the church. "Donations just are not enough."
 
An Unusual Step
 The Saint Springs Water Company is the church's first commercial undertaking since before the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917. And it is the first venture that the insular, hierarchical patriarchate has entered with a foreign partner.
Unlike participants in most joint ventures in Russia, both sides seem content. The church, which is trying to reclaim and restore property confiscated under Communism, acquired a potentially abundant source of revenue without putting up any money of its own.
And John V. R. King, a retired plastics manufacturer from Lake Arrowhead, Calif., got a resourceful and well-connected Russian partner that intervenes in business matters only when asked.
"The church has this appearance of power, and nobody really knows how much it has," Mr. King explained. "When they ask for something, they generally get it."
Mr. King said the Archbishop's office had cut through red tape, wheedled concessions from local authorities, kept interfering local government officials at bay, and even won some tax breaks. When Government officials told him he would have to provide housing and a food store for his 30 employees, Mr. King turned to the Archbishop.
"Basically, he said, 'We'll take care of it,' and he did," Mr. King said.
In a country where consumers are increasingly disillusioned with authority and mistrustful of foreigners, the church has proved deft at public relations. In July, Patriarch Aleksei II went to Kostroma to bless the venture and gamely pressed the button for the maiden journey of bottles down the conveyor belt. Archbishop Aleksandr's signature is printed on the label as a kind of religious good-housekeeping seal.
The church does not contend that the water can produce miracles, but it does try to appeal to a certain consciousness. As the Archbishop put it, "It is an ecologically clean product."
Nonsparkling bottled water is still a delicacy for ordinary Russians. Saint Springs, which is sold in the Metropol Hotel in Moscow, the Grand Hotel Europa in St. Petersburg and in hard-currency shops, is mainly sold to tourists and Western business people who fear Russian tap water. The price of a 1.5-liter bottle ranges from 90 cents to $1.80, depending on the outlet.
"This is a charitable endeavor for us," Archbishop Aleksandr said. "All the profits we plan to make will go to noble purposes."
Mr. King said the plant was already bottling and distributing one million bottles a month, which is about 20 percent of its total capacity. In the first week of September, it will be adding half-liter bottles for sale in hotel mini-bars and on airline flights.
Unlike such big bottling conglomerates as Pepsi-Cola or Schweppes, which ship bottled water to Russia, Mr. King's product is exempt from Russia's stiff import tariffs because it is domestically produced.
Mr. King put together a small group of American investors to raise millions of dollars in start-up capital. One of them, a Napa Valley wine maker, found a California craftsman to design the onion-domed plastic bottle and elegant label.
Mr. King said he planned to begin exporting Saint Springs water to the United States this autumn, marketed as an exceptionally pure water that bears the seal of approval of the highest spiritual authority in Russia. The company plans to start with cities that have large Russian populations, like New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco. The Russian Tea Room, a prominent Russian restaurant in Manhattan, requested a sample case.
"We'd definitely like to taste a Russian spring water," said John Hankinson, assistant manager at the Russian Tea Room. He said the restaurant would offer a tasting of Saint Springs with other bottled waters next week.
 
Idea Born on River Cruise
 The project began two years ago when Mr. King, who had retired after selling a company that manufactured plastic fittings for electrical conduits, took a cruise down the Volga River with a group of Dartmouth College alumni.
The group stopped at Kostroma, nearly 200 miles northeast of Moscow, to tour the restored 17th-century Church of the Resurrection. There, they met with Archbishop Aleksandr, who at the time was the Bishop of Kostroma and Gallich, and who began describing the sorry state of most churches after 70 years of state-enforced atheism.
He had decided to seek a Western partner and he listed a number of church assets, including natural springs, that might interest visiting American entrepreneurs. Mr. King was smitten.
"The idea of bottling the church's spring water just blew me away," Mr. King recalled. "I didn't sleep that night."
It took a year to select and test a water source, and then months to convert an abandoned leather warehouse into an up-to-date bottling plant, with German and American equipment. The factory walls are painted a soothing, pale aquamarine, and icons decorate every room and storage area.
Saint Spring began selling its water last month, using bottles manufactured at the site. The plant has the capacity to process 600 bottles a minute.
 
Few Financial Details
 The agreement calls for Mr. King and his fellow investors to begin splitting the profits with the church after they recoup a percentage of their initial investment. Mr. King would not disclose the details of the contract, nor the exact amount spent, except to say it involved "multiple millions" of dollars.
Archbishop Aleksandr said he checked Mr. King's credentials before signing. "Through acquaintances," he explained, then smiled slyly. "Russia is a land full of rumors."
The Archbishop gave credit to Mr. King for risking his time and money. "Many American businessmen are afraid of Russia," he said. "The economy is unstable; we have a scary tax system."
Mr. King, however, said the church was as close as he could come to a sure bet. "It's the only stable institution in Russia," he said.

HEADLINE: Banks Easing Loan Terms

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 22

 BODY:
Banks have offered better terms on loans in the last three months, but there was some tempering in demand, especially for home mortgages, the Federal Reserve said today, a sign that higher interest rates are discouraging borrowing.
In a survey of senior loan officers at 58 United States banks and 18 United States branches of overseas banks, the Fed found the terms that banks put on loans to businesses and households had eased, although not as quickly as in the previous three-month survey period that ended in May. 
 The Fed study looked at the interest rate spread between what banks charge for loans and their base rates as well as the cost and size of the credit lines they offer.
Easier terms mean businesses have freer access to credit, which helps fuel their expansion.
The Fed survey showed demand for mortgages had fallen significantly from already low levels in the spring. The Fed gave no explanation why mortgage loan applications were down.
The drop in mortgage applications forced banks to step up efforts to attract customers. The institutions were "more willing to make consumer and residential mortgage loans," the Fed said.
Demand by business for bank loans grew, although slightly below the record levels reported in May, the Fed said.
The survey said many banks had loosened their lending restrictions, particularly on loans to medium-sized concerns, because of increased competition for credit and an improving economic outlook.

HEADLINE: FLIGHT FROM CUBA: THE OVERVIEW;
U.S. WILL EXPAND PATROLS TO STOP CUBAN REFUGEES

BYLINE: By JON NORDHEIMER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: KEY WEST, Aug. 22

 BODY:
The United States moved today to expand its picket line of patrol vessels in the Florida Straits as hundreds of Cubans set sail for Florida despite the Clinton Administration's efforts to stem the exodus.
The Coast Guard reported that 2,548 refugees had been picked up at sea by midnight Monday, adding to the 1,293 refugees taken aboard United States ships on Sunday. Today's was the highest daily figure since Cubans began the newest mass departure from their island home. All will be transferred to the American naval base at Guantanamo Bay. 
 More than 2,000 Cuban refugees, the first to be denied asylum in the United States in 28 years, arrived at the Guantanamo base today. [Page A17.]
Three days after President Clinton ended the special status for fleeing Cubans and announced that they would no longer be allowed into the country, there was no sign that the change in policy was slowing the flight. The pace of departures from Cuba threatened to overwhelm the Administration's plans for intercepting Cubans and housing them at Guantanamo or at "safe havens" in the Caribbean area that have yet to be identified.
The Clinton policy seemed to be intended to dissuade individual Cubans from leaving the island and to put pressure on President Fidel Castro to stop the exodus by increasing the economic pressure on his Government. Neither strategy appears to be working.
Secretary of Defense J. William Perry, touring interception and detention operations, said at a news conference in Key West that three more Navy vessels would be added by Tuesday to the three Navy ships and 19 Coast Guard cutters already on patrol to sweep the waters for refugees and transport them to Guantanamo, on the southeast coast of Cuba.
He said that all efforts were directed at intercepting the flow of refugees from Cuba and that the Guantanamo installations could house 10,000 Cubans in addition to the 15,000 Haitians already detained at the Navy base.
The refugees continue putting out to sea despite word spreading in Cuba that they would be detained at Guantanamo, instead of being granted immediate political asylum, the practice before Mr. Clinton reversed the policy last week.
There were also indications coming from refugees already picked up that the growing presence of United States rescue ships greatly reduced the hazards of crossing the Florida Straits. The shortest distance between Cuba and Key West is 90 miles. Strong currents, however, and flimsy vessels -- many powered only by oars, paddles and grit -- often mean a much longer voyage for a departing refugee unless his craft is intercepted after leaving Cuban waters.
"These ships right now are magnets for people who want to emigrate illegally from Cuba," Rafael Dausa, political and press officer for the Cuban Mission in Washington, said in a telephone interview.
Before flying to Guantanamo to inspect the detention quarters, Mr. Perry appealed to Cubans not to embark on the high-risk voyage across shark-infested waters in boats and rafts patched together with inner tubes, plywood and rope.
 
Bigger Blockade 'an Option'
 He also said a stepped-up blockade of Cuba remained "an option, but that's not part of our present planning."
An economic blockade of an island that is more than 700 miles long would be "a very different operation" from the relief exercise now in place off Cuba's north coast, he pointed out. "It would require more resources, more ships than we have located here to do that," he said.
The Navy is currently maintaining a sea blockade of Haiti.
Speaking of the increased naval presence, Adm. Paul David Miller, commander of the United States Atlantic Command, said it was necessary to shift one Navy vessel involved in the Haitian blockade to help out in the Florida Straits. Six Navy ships were left to enforce sanctions off Port-au-Prince and other Haitian ports, an adequate force, said Admiral Miller, who accompanied the Secretary of Defense to Key West.
A tight blockade of Cuba would presumably require a much larger flotilla to circle the island. Haiti, by comparison, occupies only the western part of the island of Hispaniola and seaborne trade is compressed into a much smaller area.
In Havana, an official Cuban newspaper condemned Washington in an editorial for racheting up pressure on Mr. Castro and said the United States had long encouraged Cubans to flee their country, the Reuters news service reported.
After beckoning Cubans to freedom, an editorial in the trade union newspaper Trabajadores stated, the United States was jailing them. It also raised questions about the American decision to detain the refugees at the Guantanamo base.
"The illegal transfer of these people to the military enclave will add a new element of friction to the already tense relations between Cuba and the United States," the editorial said.
There has been no official Cuban response to Mr. Clinton's order last Saturday that reduces charter flights between Miami and Havana, halts cash remittances from Cubans living in the United States to relatives in Cuba, and increases daily broadcasts to the island.
At his Key West news conference, Mr. Perry said it was unclear at this stage how many refugees were still putting out to sea from Cuba. More than 6,000 refugees have been picked up by the Coast Guard in the last 8 days, some 12,500 so far this year.
 
Room for 10,000 Cubans
 Tent camps at Guantanamo will be ready by the end of the week to hold 10,000 Cubans, and if the present flow continues past that mark, 2,500 might be sent to "safe havens" in the Turks and Caicos Islands, Suriname and Panama, he said.
Asked how long the United States could maintain 25,000 refugees at Guantanamo, the Secretary of Defense said, "Indefinitely." He conceded, however, that detention under those conditions "is tough for people" and said he hoped that the likelihood of detention there was enough to persuade other Cubans who were thinking about leaving the island to stay home.
He and Admiral Miller left open the prospect that even more Coast Guard and Navy ships would join the force if the crisis showed no sign of abating.
Government efforts are already supplemented by rescues of Cuban rafters by commercial ships and other boating in the area. Cruise ships and cargo vessels have docked at Florida ports with dozens of refugees, and the number held at a Miami detention center has risen to more than 500, the Immigration and Naturalization Service reported.
Private boaters are encouraged by the Coast Guard to follow the Good Samaritan law and rescue anyone in distress at sea. Crews of pleasure and fishing boats haul refugees aboard their vessels on the average of three or four times a day and rendezvous with Coast Guard cutters to transfer them aboard, said Chief Petty Officer Steve Aitkins.
As a standard search operation the Coast Guard uses 110-foot cutters to sweep areas marked on charts as boxes that reach right up to the 12-mile territorial limit off Cuba, said Lieut. Comdr. Jim McPherson. They are directed to rafters by overhead spotters in Coast Guard Falcon jets and helicopters, he said, pick up the refugees and later transfer them to 270-foot cutters or Navy frigates for transportation to Guantanamo.
Forty-one-foot Coast Guard patrol boats, for the most part, are stationed along an offshore reef line paralleling the Keys to catch refugees who managed to get past the larger patrol ships, he added.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
Negotiators Ready: Anybody Know Squeeze Sign?

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
Baseball's 11-day-old strike produced two definite developments yesterday, but nothing occurred to create the possibility of a third development: that the two sides will squeeze out of their stalemate when they resume meeting tomorrow.
In development No. 1, representatives of the striking players and their employers, with the help of Federal mediators, agreed to meet at 10:30 A.M. tomorrow for the first time since the day the strike began, Aug. 12. 
 In development No. 2, Bud Selig, the acting commissioner, announced the roster of 12 owners and club executives who will be available to join the talks. Five or six had been expected to attend tomorrow's session, but one management person said it was possible all 12 would be there.
But the primary problem remained the stalemate involving the two sides after 141 missed games. The owners still want a salary cap to create what they call cost control and the players still want no part of it.
"We do not intend to negotiate with ourselves," Richard Ravitch, the owners' chief labor executive, said at an early evening news conference. "We are still awaiting the union response to our problems."
The relationship between the sides has not improved. That was evident from comments made yesterday by Donald Fehr, the players' labor leader. He described Ravitch as the owners' "hatchet man" and said "we assume at the first meeting we'll get the management chorus of 'Solidarity Forever' and 'We love Dick.' "
Ravitch declined to respond to Fehr's remarks. "I guess the last time I found name-calling to be meaningful was when I was in grade school," he said.
After meeting with Ravitch and the mediators to establish tomorrow's session, Fehr, noting that the players have been willing to meet anytime, said: "It's clear to me that he didn't want to be having these meetings, that he had to be forced into it, that they're not ready to talk yet. Nothing significant will happen. We'll be there, but it's their game, their rules."
Later, at a news conference, Fehr said: "If the owners were interested in serious negotiations, we wouldn't be having all these preliminary meetings. We'd be in there negotiating."
Each side will meet separately today with the mediators. The 12 owners and club executives will attend the management session, and Fehr said he expected somewhere between 25 and 40 players to be present for the union meeting.
Management's roster includes only three owners -- Jerry Reinsdorf of the Chicago White Sox, Jerry McMorris of the Colorado Rockies and Drayton McLane Jr. of the Houston Astros.
The rest of the roster has two club chairmen, Bill Bartholomay of Atlanta and David Glass of Kansas City; two presidents, Stan Kasten of Atlanta and Paul Beeston of Toronto; one chief executive officer, John Harrington of Boston; two executive vice presidents, Dave Montgomery of Philadelphia and Andy MacPhail of Minnesota; one vice president, Wendy Selig-Prieb of Milwaukee, and one former president, Stuart Meyer, who left the St. Louis Cardinals last Friday.
Asked why two Atlanta officials were included, Selig said: "They bring different perspectives. Kasten brings the N.B.A. economic experience. Bartholomay brings 30 years of experience. Except for Gene Autry, he's been in the game the longest of anybody."
Kasten also is president of the Atlanta Hawks, which is also owned by the Turner Broadcasting System.
 
Six Possible Hard-Liners
 The group includes six people from each league. Based on the views the individuals have expressed or their clubs' position on the owners' salary cap demand, three of the group (McMorris, Harrington and Beeston) could be classified as moderates. Six could be called hard-liners and three (Bartholomay, Kasten and Meyer) could be considered as somewhere in between, though closer to the hard-line position of wanting to change the game's economic system.
Harrington was asked at the news conference why it took owners until now to join the talks.
"This may still not be the best time to come to the table," he said. "The players haven't spoken about our proposal. We're hopeful our injection into the process will bring about a change of heart by the players to address our proposal."
Fehr declined to assess the makeup of the group.
 
Few Changes After All
 The list did not change substantially from last Friday, when Selig first issued the names, then received some complaints about the makeup, in terms of league affiliation and philosophical stance.
"Someday someone is going to have to define that," Selig said by telephone from Milwaukee, referring to a "doves and hawks" characterization. "I can look at a lot of people on this list and say I don't know where they are. The fact that they're in a small market or a big market doesn't say where they are. The fact that a small-market club needs a change, does that make them a hawk?"
Selig noted that four of the group -- McMorris, Harrington, Beeston and Meyer -- were part of the caucus of high-revenue clubs during the owners' battle over a new revenue-sharing plan. Meyer was the one who produced a compromise idea that led to an agreement among the high-revenue and low-revenue clubs last January. However, the agreement was contingent on the players' acceptance of a salary cap.
 
Fear Decrease in Salaries
 The players steadfastly have refused to accept a cap on payrolls, contending it would lower salaries artificially, impede the movement of free agents and undermine competitive balance.
Fehr also noted yesterday that "there have been no agreements on any issues. The owners still have a proposal on the table that they can fire a player 'for any reason.' "
He also commented on an oft-suggested solution to the dispute, the elimination of salary arbitration for earlier free agency.
"The fact is Ravitch has made it clear 20 to 25 times in my presence that in no circumstances are clubs interested in that," he said.

HEADLINE: Pesticides May Leave Legacy of Hormonal Chaos

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS 

 BODY:
IN a new wave of concern about synthetic chemicals in the environment, some biologists are warning that trace amounts of pesticides and other man-made substances may be interfering with the action of reproductive hormones and thereby damaging the fertility of various animal populations, including humans.
The evidence is far from conclusive. But the economic and political stakes are high; should the new fears prove justified, a large group of important industrial chemicals might have to be curbed. 
 At least 45 synthetic chemicals, most of them pesticides, have been found to upset the workings of the hormonal, or endocrine system, and for this reason they are known as endocrine disruptors. There is little doubt, many scientists agree, that when people or animals are exposed to large doses of these chemicals, as has happened in chemical spills or contamination of food, serious derangements of reproductive function sometimes result. Male alligators born in Florida's Lake Apopka after a large pesticide spill in 1980 were found to be incapable of producing sperm. In Taiwan, reproductive and other defects have been noted in the sons of women who in 1978 and 1979 ingested cooking oil contaminated with PCB's.
The question at issue is whether trace amounts of these chemicals that are now widely distributed in the environment are exerting a less visible but still pernicious effect on the reproductive fitness of many species of wildlife and possibly even humans.
For at least some wildlife populations, "I'd say we are on a fast track to extinction," said Dr. Theodora Colborn, a zoologist with the World Wildlife Fund, a conservation organization in Washington, who is a leading exponent of the view that endocrine disruptors pose a potentially serious threat. "You would expect the same thing to happen with human populations."
Other experts disagree. "I don't think it is a huge problem at this point," said Dr. Thomas Goldsworthy, a toxicologist with the Chemical Industry Institute of Technology, a nonprofit research organization at Research Triangle Park, N.C., that is largely supported by industry. Said Dr. Tom Orme, a Washington-based toxicologist with the American Council on Science and Health in New York, which has long held claims of harm from chemicals in the environment to be exaggerated: "We suspect there is a lot of baloney here. On the other hand, to develop the hard science to refute it is going to be a formidable task."
Still other experts view the issue as possibly serious but say it is too early to call it one way or the other. "We don't want to argue we've got a massive problem," said Dr. Larry Reiter, the director of the Environmental Protection Agency's Health Effects Research Laboratory at Research Triangle Park. But he also said, "I don't think we want to argue there is no problem."
Although many biologists are convinced that endocrine disruptors are pervasive, they have not yet been able to assess the quantity and distribution of the chemicals in the environment. Nor is there any good survey to tell what burden of these chemicals is carried in the body fat of the general population.
But a number of studies suggest grounds for concern, particularly from the combined effects of several different chemicals acting in concert either to mimic or block the crucial effects of natural estrogens on sexual development in the fetus.
Dr. Ana M. Soto and Dr. Carlos Sonnenschein, biologists at Tufts University, have found that doses of estrogen-mimicking pesticides too small to have any effect individually on test-tube cultures of cells from breast-cancer tissue have a powerful effect when combined. Estrogens spur the growth of such cells. Other laboratory studies have shown that the synthetic chemicals can disrupt the reproductive development of mammal fetuses. And field investigations have traced reproductive disorders in mammals and birds to the consumption of fish whose flesh contained the chemicals.
Dr. Colborn, Dr. Soto and others who are alarmed about endocrine disruptors say that all chemicals that reach the environment should be tested for their hormonal effect just as they are already tested for ability to cause cancer or mutations. Some environmentalists are calling for a phaseout of endocrine-disruptor chemicals, and already there is legislation before Congress to replace some chlorine compounds, many of which have been identified as endocrine disruptors, with feasible alternatives. The E.P.A. and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service have asked the National Academy of Sciences to investigate the problem. Meanwhile, those who are raising the alarm about endocrine disruptors have been energetic in seeking attention in the press and on television, where the subject has lately been explored, sometimes in apocalyptic tones.
The debate is in some ways a replay of "Silent Spring," Rachel Carson's landmark book published in 1962, in which she argued that fat-soluble pesticides in the bodies of birds were interfering with reproduction. Her thesis provoked a barrage of criticism, but biologists in time learned that many chlorinated hydrocarbons like DDT do indeed sabotage reproduction, for example by making the shells of birds' eggs too fragile.
 
Persistent Chemical Residues
 DDT and similar pesticides like aldrin and dieldrin were banned long ago in the United States. But their residues persist in the environment, not the least because they remain in use in much of the world and are being transported to America on globe-girdling winds.
Moreover, there are many industrial chemicals that are hormonally active and that may find their way into the environment even though, unlike pesticides, they are not deliberately released. These include some members of a family of chemicals known as alkyl phenols, which Dr. Soto has found to have estrogen-like effects. These chemicals are used in plastics, including some food wrappings, as well as in several industrial processes, in paper and pulp production, textiles, hair colorings, spermicides and condom lubricants and as inert ingredients in pesticides. They are also used in industrial detergents, and their estrogenic components are released into the environment when the detergents break down. Dr. Soto has found that some of the chemicals can leach out of plastic containers and contaminate the contents.
The new phase of the debate about endocrine disruptors started with a meeting of 21 scientists in Racine, Wis., organized by Dr. Colborn in 1991. They concluded that many man-made chemicals released into the environment certainly possess "the potential to disrupt the endocrine systems of animals, including humans." Among the observed symptoms linked to these chemicals by the scientists were the feminization of male fish, birds and mammals; decreased fertility in birds, fish, shellfish and mammals; hatching failure and serious birth defects in birds, fish and turtles, and impaired metabolism in birds, fish and mammals.
The 1991 meeting focused biologists' attention on the problem, and further evidence has been gathered of endocrine disruptors at work. But it is in many ways equivocal and no clear picture has yet emerged from the data. A second group of wildlife scientists who met last December in Racine said it has been difficult to demonstrate causal relationships between the chemicals and declines in wildlife populations. They found that different species metabolize the chemicals in different ways, and that the mix of endocrine disruptors in the environment constantly changes from time to time and place to place. The experts also noted that other factors, including naturally occurring fluctuations in animal populations, could be at work.
Recent field and laboratory studies in the Great Lakes, a region often cited as a prime example of the problem, are revealing. Levels of chemicals like dioxins, furans and PCB's, three prime suspects as causes of gross birth defects and reproductive malfunctions, have declined in the lakes since the 1970's, Dr. John P. Giesy, an aquatic toxicologist at Michigan State University in East Lansing, and two colleagues reported this year in the journal Environmental Science and Technology. Their study found that some bird populations, including those of herring gulls and double-crested cormorants, have made "dramatic recoveries" since then.
But they also found that at several locations around the Great Lakes, including Saginaw Bay and Green Bay, overall concentrations of this class of chemicals still exceed thresholds at which they cause population declines. Only in these more contaminated areas are the chemicals still having significant effects on bird populations, which continue to display abnormally high rates of developmental defects and embryo deaths. These ill effects, Dr. Giesy and his colleagues wrote, "are caused by the toxic effects of multiple compounds, which expressed their effects through a common mechanism of action."
 
Danger in the Great Lakes
 Concentrations of the chemicals in the Great Lakes have stopped falling and are "bouncing around at the same level, and it looks like they're going to be there for some time to come," said Dr. Geisy. The reasons, he said, are that atmospheric deposits of chemicals from other parts of the world still land there and the waters of the Great Lakes are replenished slowly -- up to 100 years for Lake Michigan and 300 years for Lake Superior.
In most instances, Dr. Geisy said, people are exposed to much lower concentrations of the chemicals than are animals, "but there is a lot of uncertainty and a lot of data gaps." The difference, he said, is that while both people and animals can ingest the chemicals in food, people can and do restrict their intake of, for example, fish contaminated by the chemicals. "If we ate the fish they do," he said, speaking of the wildlife, "we would probably exhibit some of the same effects."
Indeed, one study found that children of mothers who ate two or three fish a month from contaminated Lake Michigan waters for at least 6 years were born slightly early, weighed less at birth, had smaller skulls, and displayed cognitive, motor and behavioral defects at birth. The effects were associated with what the mothers ate during a lifetime rather than just during pregnancy.
But perhaps the greatest fears expressed about the effects of endocrine disruptors on humans have to do with sex and reproduction. The case of the Taiwanese boys may reflect the effects of high doses. But more insidious and threatening in the long run, say Dr. Colborn and others, may be the subtle effects of low doses in the womb. As was shown with the synthetic hormone DES, prescribed from 1948 to 1971 to prevent miscarriages, exposure of the fetus to endocrine disruptors can cause reproductive problems that do not become evident until many years later.
Much attention has been given to an alarming finding by a Danish study that the sperm count of men from industrialized countries seriously dwindled between 1938 and 1991. Reporting in the British Medical Journal in 1992, the researchers concluded that there had been a "genuine decline" in sperm counts and volume of semen over the previous half-century. The paper also cited an apparent parallel rise in other reproductive tract problems such as undescended testes, malformed penises and testicular cancer. The researchers cited environmental rather than genetic factors as the probable cause but carefully noted that it remained to be determined whether synthetic estrogens were responsible.
A 1994 paper in the same journal has challenged the study's method. Even if the basic finding is correct, some experts say, there is no clear evidence to blame a decline in semen count on environmental chemicals. The study "did raise a legitimate concern that should be followed up, but there's no way on earth that study could be considered definitive," said Dr. Neil MacLusky, a researcher in reproductive endocrinology at the University of Toronto Medical School. "They say the most likely explanation is an environmental factor, but there's no way they can control for patterns of sexual activity in the last 40 years, or levels of sexually transmitted diseases. These factors could just as easily be responsible for changes in sperm count."
 
'Serious Long-Term Threat'
 Nevertheless, Dr. MacLusky considers that environmental contaminants in general are "a very serious long-term threat not just to animals but to all vertebrate life."
Dr. Stephen Safer, a toxicologist at Texas A & M University, demurs, arguing that the synthetic estrogens are far weaker than natural estrogens both in the body and in the environment. The synthetics, he says, would be "swamped out" by a "whole huge spectrum" of natural estrogens and anti-estrogens. "But," he added, "it's still an area of concern; I don't want to sweep it under the rug or anything like that."
Dr. Lynn Goldman, an environmental epidemiologist who is the assistant administrator for prevention, pesticides and toxic substances at the E.P.A., may speak for many when she says that at this stage of the scientific investigation, "I think the data would argue that we are seeing some effects" of endocrine disruptors in the environment.
But for now science simply does not know enough to say just how serious a threat they pose.

HEADLINE: Mexico's Choice

 BODY:
Although Sunday's presidential election in Mexico was not as clean as it should have been, on present evidence it was the cleanest in living memory. That should give President-elect Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon the mandate he needs to carry political and economic reform through its difficult next phase.
A credible Mexican election is also a relief for the U.S. Immigration, border commerce and the North American Free Trade Agreement increasingly link the fates of North America's two giants. 
 Despite heavy spending on electoral safeguards and intense international scrutiny, there were embarrassing incidents. Some people could not get ballots. Others complained that voting secrecy had been compromised. Independent monitors reported instances of multiple voting. But preliminary figures suggest so wide a margin for Mr. Zedillo, of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, that hanky-panky is unlikely to have affected the outcome.
As of late yesterday, official returns from more than a third of the polling stations gave Mr. Zedillo around 48 percent of the vote, Diego Fernandez de Cevallos of the National Action Party around 30 percent and Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of the Democratic Revolutionary Party around 16 percent. In Congress, the combined opposition will come close to a majority in the new lower house. If the main opposition parties can find a way to work together on legislative issues, they could introduce a measure of pluralism into Mexican political life.
Mr. Zedillo has up to now been known as a technocrat and economic reformer. But it is increasingly evident that economic reform cannot go forward unless it marches in tandem with political liberalization. The wrenching changes Mexico has been going through demand a government with the kind of legitimacy the PRI lost years ago. Regaining that legitimacy requires accountability, checks and balances, openness and decentralization.
A powerful, autocratic President like Carlos Salinas de Gortari could sell off state companies, oust union bosses, renegotiate bank debt and secure Nafta. But for investors, entrepreneurs and consumers to make the new market structures work for Mexico requires that power be decentralized and government made accountable to its citizens.
To achieve that, Mr. Zedillo will have to challenge the PRI bosses and bureaucrats with whom Mr. Salinas chose to coexist. In their place, he will have to develop new constituencies among reform's beneficiaries -- not just obvious winners like big business, but also urban consumers and workers who fear the insecurities of a market economy as much as they appreciate its benefits.
If Mr. Zedillo identifies himself with political reform, he could draw support from the independent civic organizations that sprang up to monitor this year's vote. He could make a good start by following through on campaign pledges to reform the PRI, particularly by democratizing the way it chooses candidates. Past Presidents have kept the choice of nominees under tight personal control.
Clean elections are only a first step toward political reform, but an essential first step.

HEADLINE: Medisave Appeals to Low-Income Employees;
Healthier and Wealthier

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Don't Be Seduced by Medisave" (editorial, Aug. 16) contains inaccuracies about medical savings accounts. But most surprising is your lack of understanding about how markets work. 
 The Business Coalition for Affordable Health Care, which represents 900,000 businesses participating in markets every day, believes medical savings accounts will help alleviate health care inflation, the root of many reasons for health care reform.
Medical savings accounts are working well in a number of companies, although without the favorable tax treatment that would make them even more desirable and widespread.
NBC News reported on medical savings accounts at Forbes magazine and found employees happier, healthier and wealthier because of their medical savings accounts. Forbes has dramatically reduced its health care costs in an era when such costs for businesses have increased an average of 13 percent a year.
We see medical savings accounts as an opportunity to (1) reduce health care costs for employers; (2) improve the benefits we offer our employees, and (3) preserve and extend consumer choices. Medical savings accounts create incentives for employees to use health care efficiently and appropriately. That's good for employees, for employers and for all Americans.

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Top economic officials are frustrated that the Clinton Administration has not received more credit for recent economic growth. The reason is simple. The Federal Reserve Board's perverse logic has conditioned investors, economic analysts and everyone else to view growth not as a boon but as a dire portent of inflation and higher interest rates. Nowadays, good news is bad news. The Administration cannot receive credit where credit is due.

HEADLINE: FLIGHT FROM CUBA: THE OVERVIEW -- U.S. Scrambling to Cope With the Rising Tide of Cuban Refugees;
Washington Considers Housing Newcomers at Mainland Sutes

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 23

 BODY:
Alarmed that its new policy of keeping out Cuban boat people has failed to stem the flow of refugees, the Clinton Administration is considering greatly expanding the capacity of the naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to handle them.
With the flood of Cubans picked up at sea exceeding 2,000 for the second straight day, some Administration officials said they might be forced to consider an emergency option: placing the Cubans in military bases and other Federal properties on the mainland, as was done during the Mariel exodus of 1980 when 125,000 Cubans left for the United States. 
 At a White House meeting this afternoon, senior officials discussed what to do if the exodus of Cubans did not slow down. One option was expanding Guantanamo's capacity to accommodate more than 16,000 Cubans and to rapidly open "safe havens" for Cubans in countries around the Caribbean. They said that negotiations to establish such havens were going well, but they did not announce any agreements.
More than 7,000 refugees have been picked up since Friday. Under the Administration's contingency planning, Guantanamo and the safe havens are expected to accommodate between 20,000 to 25,000 refugees.
In a development that Administration officials found ominous, more and more Cubans are arriving in small boats, rather than rafts, signaling that the Cuban Government may be letting Cubans leave in larger craft than the ones used a week ago.
White House officials say they continue to hope that President Clinton's decision to deny entry to Cubans will staunch the refugee flow before the available places are filled. The Coast Guard said that 2,886 Cuban refugees had been picked up in the Florida Straits as of 10 P.M. On Monday, American ships picked up 2,548 refugees, the largest daily amount since the Mariel boatlift.
"It's not clear why the Cubans aren't reacting the way we expected," said a State Department official.
Given the trend, the Administration has begun to plan for accommodating an outpouring well beyond the worst projections of last week. At the same time, U.S. officials say they are worried that any move that could be construed as giving hope to would-be immigrants would undermine efforts to persuade Cubans to remain at home.
 
Sticking With the Plan
 President Clinton was briefed today on the Cuba situation by Sandy Berger, the deputy national security adviser. Administration officials said that at a White House meeting this afternoon on Cuba, senior officials decided to stick with the new policy of turning away refugees.
Officials are trying to slow the refugee flow by accelerating plans to expand radio and television broadcasts that will urge Cubans not to set to sea.
Administration officials also said today that they planned to increase ways for Cubans to migrate legally to the United States by applying within Cuba. One plan is to allow Cubans with relatives in the United States to be taken off a waiting list so that they would be allowed to migrate during the next few months.
Immigration experts said that such measures would not affect a large number of Cubans and were unlikely to have much effect on the recent exodus of Cuban boat people.
The Administration is also considering expanding the number of categories -- such as being imprisoned for political views -- under which Cubans could qualify for refugee status. These moves are intended to demonstrate that the Administration is sincere about urging Cubans who want to immigrate to apply at processing facilities in Cuba.
"If you get 150,000 people coming out of Cuba, you may have to look at all kinds of options," said an Administration official.
 
A Political Risk
 One option under consideration is to revive parts of a classified contingency plan developed during the 1980's after the Mariel boatlift. It calls for, among other things, distributing Cuban refugees around the United States so that Florida is not unduly burdened. Under that plan, many Cuban refugees would be detained at Federal sites until the Administration figures out when and where to release them.
Such a move would undoubtedly be a political hot potato for the President and for many governors, who remember an incident that helped cause Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas to lose his race for re-election in 1980. Several hundred Cuban refugees who were taken to Fort Chaffee in Arkansas rioted, injuring several military police officers. About 200 Cubans escaped but were captured.
Several officials said that after the Administration vowed in recent days not to allow Cuban boat people into the country, they would be reluctant to reverse that policy and place the Cubans on the mainland. A senior White House official said tonight: "The President's not going to do that. It's not on the table." Indeed, one official said the President might favor returning refugees directly to Cuba before he would accept them into the United States.
Another option, Administration officials said, is to expand Guantanamo's capacity by clearing unused, scrub-covered parts of the base's beachfront to hold tents and sleeping bags.
Fourteen thousand Haitians are being held in one portion of the Guantanamo Base, and the Administration has said that within days it will expand the base's capacity so it can hold about 10,000 Cuban refugees.
Nonetheless, Pentagon officials said that it that would be extremely difficult to prepare Guantanamo for tens of thousands more refugees because of problems providing water and sewage disposal.
One Defense Department official said the Pentagon might soon send additional security and medical personnel to Guantanamo to handle the increase of refugees at the base, which usually houses 5,000 military and civilian workers and their dependents.
Administration officials say they hope that within the next week or two, they will receive permission to place up to 10,000 Cubans in safe havens around the Caribbean. To accommodate the Cubans, the Administration is rushing to renegotiate agreements with nations that had previously promised to temporarily shelter for Haitian refugees. Brunson McKinley, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Refugee Programs, is visiting Caribbean capitals this week to discuss safe havens.
 
Havens in the Caribbean
 Dee Dee Myers, the White House press secretary, said today that Surinam and Dominica had each previously agreed to hold 2,500 Haitians, while St. Lucia said it would accept 5,000. She said Nicaragua, Honduras, Costa Rica and El Salvador have said "they will be willing to explore the possibility" of housing Cubans. Other countries that have been approached to hold Cubans are Antigua, Grenada, Panama and Britain's Turks and Caicos Islands.
Although the flood of refugees has become a headache for the Administration, officials said today that they were optimistic that turmoil created by the exodus would pressure Fidel Castro to adopt political and economic reforms.
"If you get a lot of people starting to move, and it backs up, that could create an uncomfortable situation for Castro," one State Department official said. "There's a lot more privation in Cuba than there was during Mariel and there's much more willingness now to challenge the regime."

HEADLINE: Resurgence in Export Trade Invigorates Port of New York

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ELIZABETH, N.J.

 BODY:
As long as three football fields, its decks piled with so much foreign cargo that it looked like a floating warehouse, the freighter Raleigh Bay plodded into a dock here the other day for a stopover that once might have been decidedly lopsided: imports off, nothing back on.
But this time, in an increasingly common sight at the Port of New York and New Jersey, the ship took on a heartland's worth of American products, from chemicals to animal feed to medical supplies. It was another indication that the export business, dormant for years, is revitalizing a port that had begun to slip from the ranks of the world's great maritime centers. 
 Since 1985, the volume of exports of containerized cargo from New York Harbor has jumped about 53 percent, from 2.68 million long tons to 4.10 million long tons. (A long ton, the traditional measure of shipping, is 2,240 pounds; a regular ton is 2,000 pounds.) The value of that cargo, an indicator that underscores the port's influence on the region's economy, rose from $9.59 billion to $17.14 billion, a 32 percent increase after inflation is factored in.
The port is snatching back export cargo from the Midwest and Canada that it had lost to rivals like Baltimore; Philadelphia; Norfolk, Va.; Charleston, S.C., and Halifax, Nova Scotia. It has reclaimed customers like General Motors, which has consolidated all its exporting to Europe in Newark, shipping 35,000 vehicles a year, most of which are assembled in the Midwest.
The turnabout has been a boon for a maritime industry that remains a powerful economic engine in the region; the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey estimates that the port handled $56.31 billion in cargo last year, directly or indirectly generating 180,800 jobs.
Before the recent climb in exports, the port was considered dangerously dependent on import traffic -- delivering stereos and beer and countless other foreign wares to the 17 million consumers within a day's drive of Elizabeth and Newark, the two cities where shipping activity has been concentrated since the advent of containerized operations in the 1960's.
The port's new strength to some extent reflects the overall increase in the country's export business and a decline in the value of the dollar, which depresses the price of American products. Factories across the nation are churning out higher-quality goods, like Detroit's new generation of vehicles, which are luring more and more buyers in foreign lands.
 
Fighting a Reputation
 
 
But perhaps just as important have been the efforts by the Port of New York and New Jersey to shed its reputation as a rickety giant that was falling behind in a business being transformed by technology.
"We as a country and as a port have to learn that there is a tremendous opportunity for us in the export marketplace," said Lillian C. Liburdi, director of port operations at the Port Authority. "What we are really seeing now is the result of us going after that business more thoughtfully and more aggressively."
For centuries, New York Harbor dominated the country's maritime commerce, dealing in imports and exports in roughly equal measure, sending off goods that poured out of the many factories that were the bedrock of the Northeast's economy. But with the steep decline in manufacturing in the region in recent decades, as well as competition from lower-cost ports that were quicker to modernize, the Port of New York and New Jersey suffered.
 
Competition From Railways
 Exports fell to 10 to 20 percent of its trade in the late 1970's and early 1980's, officials said. At the same time, imports dropped as companies discovered that instead of shipping products from eastern Asia to the East Coast through the Panama Canal, they could save money by shipping them to the West Coast and use new, advanced railways for the rest of the journey.
Deregulation of the nation's transportation industries in the 1970's also sliced into the port's revenues. New trading patterns arose as manufacturers were able to choose the cheapest and fastest routes from among dozens of trucking lines, railroads and ports, many of which were actively courting customers.
"It has become quite clear to ports big and small that there is precious little cargo that is naturally linked to their ports," said Erik Stromberg, president of the American Association of Port Authorities. "The competitive dynamics have actually gone much farther afield than was ever envisioned when surface transportation was deregulated 15 years ago. We have a situation where ports are looking to grab cargo literally from the backyard of other port cities."
 
No Longer Top Port
 This revamping of the shipping business stripped the Port of New York and New Jersey of its standing as the nation's top port in terms of value and volume of containerized cargo, pushing it to second or third, after Los Angeles and Long Beach, Calif.
And even though the port was still handling tens of billions of dollars in cargo, some experts predicted that its decline would continue because its terminals were outmoded, its productivity low and its costs excessive.
The Port Authority has responded by investing hundreds of millions of dollars in technology, including new railway links, a crucial addition in an era when most cargo moves in 20- or 40-foot containers that are put directly from freighters onto trucks and trains -- all the while tracked by computers.
The agency has improved its marketing and relations with government, shipping companies and manufacturers. Seeking to make up for the drop in export cargo that mirrored the decline in the Northeast's industrial base, it has wooed business from other areas of the country by offering discounts for goods that originate more than 260 miles away.
 
Labor Situation Improves
 There have also been improvements in the notoriously inefficient labor situation at the port, a legacy of the days when the longshoremen's union had to be guaranteed jobs before it would allow more mechanized operations.
"We are very pleased to say that they have made some pretty significant changes there over the past four or five years," said John J. Baisley, director of international transportation for General Motors, which ships 30 percent of its exports through the port. "The Port Authority has really made a concerted effort to get business back."
Other companies like Mazda and Pfizer, the pharmaceuticals manufacturer, are also using the port more.
As a result of these moves, trade in containerized cargo has remained level at the port over the last decade, ranging from 10 million to 13 million long tons, as exports have replaced imports that were depressed because of the rise of the West Coast ports.
 
380% of North Atlantic Trade
 Still, it seems unlikely that the port will soon return to the days of the 1960's, when it held well over 60 percent of the North Atlantic trade. Now, officials say, the port handles about 38 percent of the North Atlantic trade for containerized cargo and certain other goods, like autos and steel.
Philadelphia has about 21 percent of that business; Norfolk, 19 percent, and Baltimore, 16 percent.
Many manufacturers and transportation companies still consider the port a mess, citing numerous problems, from the delays that trucks encounter on New Jersey's roadways to fears about the involvement of mobsters to environmental disputes over the dredging of New York Harbor, which keeps the shipping channels clear for huge freighters.
"We would still prefer not to use the Port of New York if we can avoid it," said Stanley Filipiak, director of transportation for National Starch and Chemical Company, based in Bridgewater, N.J. "Coming from the Midwest, it's usually less expensive going through Baltimore, even if New York is closer. It's a hassle as far as New York is concerned. The access is so antiquated."
 
A Better Balance
 Despite such criticisms, the spurt in exports appears to be making the port a more attractive hub for transportation companies, which had often complained that a balance of trade heavily tilted toward imports was inefficient for them because they hauled cargo in only one direction.
In the early 1980's, a freighter like the Raleigh Bay, which is owned by Sea-Land Service, might have earned money carrying pasta and glassware and perfume to New York, but then made little returning directly to Spain and Italy because it picked up few goods here. This year, exporting has been so profitable for Sea-Land that it has added an extra weekly stopover here.
The port's rivals, once the beneficiaries of its woes, have noted its resurgence.
"There has been more diversion of our cargo through the U.S., particularly through New York," said David F. Bellefontaine, president of the Halifax Port Corporation. "That affects our competitive position. I would rather have a competitor that is in a state of disarray, like New York used to be."
Given the huge demand for imports in the region, the port will probably not attain a 50-50 ratio between imports and exports any time soon. But the percentage of exports has climbed to between 30 percent and 35 percent for containerized cargo, from 10 to 20 percent, and could reach nearly 40 percent by the end of the decade, said Michael L. Sclar, an analyst at the consulting firm of DRI/ McGraw-Hill.
Port officials and executives at transportation companies said they hoped that a more balanced trade here will become permanent, because that, they maintained, would send ripples throughout the region's economy.
"The average person has no idea what export volume means to the economy," said R. Gregory Moore, general manager at Newark for the Maersk steamship company, which runs six vessels a week into New York harbor, each capable of carrying several thousand containers.
"There are a lot of people that are involved: trucking companies, distribution companies, manufacturing companies," he said. "It's not only the people who work in the terminals and with the carriers. Increased exports increase jobs."

HEADLINE: FLIGHT FROM CUBA: CHARTER FLIGHTS;
Despite Clinton's Order, Travelers Going to Island

BYLINE: By JON NORDHEIMER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MIAMI, Aug. 23

 BODY:
Charter flights have continued flying to Cuba despite President Clinton's weekend announcement that he was halting them to punish Fidel Castro for encouraging refugees to escape the island.
The delay in implementing his order was forced by the need to work out new regulations on air travel between Miami and Havana, Treasury Department officials said today. 
 The department's Foreign Assets Control Office, which oversees restrictions on travel to Cuba, has been working on the regulations and is scheduled to publish them on Wednesday, officials said.
Meanwhile, Cuban-Americans rushed to book tickets on a flight scheduled to leave Wednesday. Ten charter flights a week carry about 65,000 round-trip passengers a year to Cuba, said Francisco Aruca, who runs Marazul Charters, one of three companies authorized to operate flights to Cuba. About 40,000 of these passengers live in the United States. The rest are Cubans with American visas allowing them to visit the United States, he said.
 
Other Travelers From U.S.
 In addition to Cubans with families on the island, those permitted to visit the island are journalists, professional researchers and scholars, official government travelers and "sponsored travelers," those whose trips are paid for by Cuba or another nation.
While the Treasury Department declined to say how travel would be restricted, speculation in Miami was that travel by Cuban-Americans would be sharply reduced except for humanitarian reasons, such as for the illness or death of a family member.
Travelers who leave this week or are already in Cuba will probably return to Miami aboard a few planes allowed to fly to Havana after Wednesday, Mr. Aruca said.
Hundreds of Cuban-Americans who have already booked reservations for future flights were left in doubt. "We're supposed to go next week," said Irene Fernandez, a 31-year-old nurse in Key West, who for the past week had helped treat Cuban refugees escaping by sea from Cuba.
 
Money to Cuba at Stake
 She and others waited for the other shoe to drop on the Presidential edict. "Is he really taking all the trips off?" she asked. "If so, who can go?" She and others said if direct charter flights were grounded they might attempt to get into Cuba through third countries like Mexico.
New rules are also expected on the amount of money sent from the United States to Cuba. Under present regulations the limit on money sent to a Cuban household is $280 a quarter.
"If they prohibit sending money from here it's going to be worse," said Milton Serret of Cuba Paquetes, a Miami agency that ships cash and packages. He said that if similar agencies opened in another country the United States would lose control over how much cash is sent.
The President on Saturday prohibited Americans from sending cash to Cuba and said he was cutting off charter flight as a way to deprive Mr. Castro of hard currency and weaken an already shaky economy.
Mr. Aruco's agency flies a 123-seat Boeing 727 jet on the 45-minute flight to Cuba on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, he said, usually at 80 percent capacity.
 
Political Move Is Seen
 His company originated the first charter flights to Havana in 1979 after a dialogue between Mr. Castro and Cuban exiles led to bilateral easing of tensions between the two countries. He said he felt the new hard-line policies embraced by Mr. Clinton in reaction to the new wave of refugees trying to reach the United States from Cuba was motivated more by politics than anything else.
"I have no doubt this decision was made to help Lawton Chiles this year and Mr. Clinton in 1996," he asserted.
Mr. Chiles, the Democratic Governor of Florida, is in a tough re-election race. The President would benefit in the 1996campaign if a Democrat is governing the state, with 25 electoral votes.
Mr. Aruca also suggested that Mr. Chiles and the President were wooing right-wing Cuban-American interests by making life more difficult for Mr. Castro. Right-wing elements have targeted Mr. Aruca and his travel agency since 1979 as a sympathizer of Mr. Castro's regime.
 
Violence Aimed at Him
 "To be called a pro-Communist in America is not dangerous," he said. "But in Miami it is a death sentence."
Two pipe bombs exploded outside his office in 1989. He said he is regularly assailed by right-wing Cuban radio commentators.
Yet, Cuban-Americans longing for a brief return home from exile have been flying with him for 15 years. Mr. Aruca feels the impact of the passenger traffic between Miami and Havana has been telling. He said the first year of charter flights sent 100,000 exiles back to Cuba for a visit, carrying gifts to impoverished relatives.
"The next year what happened?" he asks. "The Mariel boatlift! All those Cubans got a taste of what life was like in America by seeing how well off their exiled relatives were."
Mr. Castro's reaction to "the headaches" caused by Cuban-American travelers was to sharply curtail the number granted visas, Mr. Aruca said. From 1980 to 1985, Cuba cut back sharply on the number of visitors from the United States, while the cost of a one-week package doubled to $1,500, including mandatory payments to Government-operated hotels, Mr. Aruca said. "He wanted the hard currency, exchanged at an official rate of one peso for one dollar, but he didn't want the social unrest the visitors caused," he said.
 
Dollars Make Difference
 When Radio Marti began broadcasting to Cuba from the United States in 1986, Mr. Castro retaliated by cutting travelers on family visits down to 50 a week, a level gradually increased to 96 by 1993 when negotiations increased it by 500 a week.
Another important difference made by the visitors came when they were permitted to send or carry dollars to relatives in Cuba, Mr. Aruca said. The United States limited the amount to $280 every three months for each household, he said.

HEADLINE: Outside Income for British M.P.'s Is Questioned

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
As a consultant to a Scottish electricity company, Philip Gallie keeps it up to date on what is happening in the House of Commons and sets up meetings with legislators. The company, Scottish Power P.L.C., pays him an undisclosed fee -- probably around $15,000 a year -- and gives him use of a company car.
But the consulting job is just a sideline for Mr. Gallie. He is better known as the Member of Parliament for Ayr, on Scotland's west coast, and for serving on the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs. 
 Although the practice is now coming under growing scrutiny, the fact that Mr. Gallie is on Scottish Power's payroll even as he serves his constituents as a legislator at nearly $50,000 a year is neither illegal nor even unusual in British politics.
"I'm very pleased to do the work I do with Scottish Power," said Mr. Gallie, a Conservative, who was employed by the company for 28 years before being elected to Parliament in 1992. "At all times it's clearly understood that my constituents come first."
 
Disclosed in Official Register
 Allowed to cultivate nearly any business relationships they wish as long as they are publicly disclosed in an official register, members of Parliament, especially from the governing Conservative Party, routinely sign on as advisers or consultants to corporations, trade groups and lobbying enterprises.
Unlike their counterparts in the United States Congress, who are barred from having any outside earned income and who face limits on gifts and speaking fees, British M.P.'s also continue to practice law, run companies, write newspaper columns or do whatever other work they have time and inclination for. The exception is Government ministers, who must end their outside business deals.
The 1,200 members of the unelected House of Lords, which has little legislative power, have no limits on outside work, and the only disclosure requirement they face is to identify any relevant outside interests when speaking during debates.
The British practice dates back to a time when a seat in Parliament was a part-time commitment in a country that eschewed professional politicians. It has grown in recent years as the old class and school ties that once bound Government and industry leaders in an old-boy network have broken down, leaving companies and trade groups scrambling for information and access.
Given the intermingling of money and politics in the corridors of Westminster, there have been remarkably few influence-peddling scandals. Perhaps that is because few M.P.'s have any real say in policy making -- the Prime Minister and his Cabinet do that -- and because M.P.'s are expected to vote as directed by their party.
 
Reporters Pose as Executives
 But the subject burst into the news again recently when The Sunday Times of London sent two reporters into the halls of Parliament posing as business executives who needed help getting information from the Government.
The reporters asked 20 M.P.'s to submit a written question to the Government on behalf of their companies, and offered 1,000, or about $1,500, for their trouble. Eighteen of the M.P.'s declined, suggesting for the most part that the businessmen go to their local M.P. for help, but two, both members of the Conservative Party, accepted the offer. Both men, Graham Riddick and David Tredinnick, subsequently returned the checks sent to them, and denied they had done anything improper.
The case led Prime Minister John Major to call for a parliamentary investigation into the matter, and reopened a debate over the responsibilities of M.P.'s and conflicts of interest.
"The wider question bears very heavily on the relationship between Parliament and the community," said Philip Norton, a professor of government at the University of Hull. "Are members of Parliament representing the interests of constituents or are they spending a lot of their time seeking rewards for themselves?"
 
No Inclination to Change
 Parliament has debated the issue a number of times, and starting this year has required members to be more specific in listing their outside ties in the annual Register of Members' Interests.
But Parliament has shown no inclination to change the system significantly, and critics of the practice say there is little chance of wholesale reform now. Many members argue that the salary from Parliament is inadequate, even with supplements for travel, housing in London and office staff, and that cutting off outside ties would drive qualified people away from public service.
"The problem fundamentally is that there are a lot of people in Westminster who have dug in deep with outside interests and are not prepared to give it up without a fight," said Dale N. Campbell-Savours, an opposition Labor Party M.P. who has long sought tighter restrictions but considers a ban on all outside financial ties unrealistic.
The practice remains most prevalent by far among the Conservatives, who have the benefit of being in political power as well as being ideologically in tune with the corporate world.
Most Labor M.P.'s receive campaign contributions in the range of $1,000 and other support, like donated office space or use of researchers, from unions. But they do not receive money personally from the unions.
 
Amounts Not Disclosed
 Members of Parliament are not required to specify how much they make from their outside business relationships, but many of the 650 members of the House of Commons pull down tens of thousands of dollars a year in extra income. Of the 650, 182 listed themselves as paid advisers or consultants in the annual Register of Members' Interests. Scores more are directors of companies and essentially serve the same purpose.
According to the Register of Members' Interests in the House of Commons and company reports, Peter Ainsworth, a Conservative, is a director of JLI Group, a food company, and a Parliamentary consultant to S. G. Warburg, one of Britain's largest investment banks. Jack Aspinwall, a Conservative, is parliamentary consultant to British Gas, the utility company; BAA, the company that operates Britain's airports, and Rentokil, a pest control and environmental cleanup company.
Patrick Nicholls, a former low-level Government minister, has signed on as parliamentary adviser or consultant to no fewer than nine organizations, including the British Shops and Stores Association, the Minotels Europe Group hotel chain and Hill & Smith Holdings, a large manufacturer of steel and other metal products.
Until he was appointed to the Government this month to a major Government transportation job, John Watts, a Conservative, was an adviser to British Bus P.L.C., which operates bus lines around the country.
In part, the willingness of Parliament to allow near total freedom to sell access and expertise seems to stem from a deeply held belief that members are all "honorable," as they like to call each other, and that all will keep duty to Queen and country, not to mention their constituents, above mere pecuniary gain.
 
'We Are the Least Corrupt'
 Many British politicians maintain that the system is far less abused than campaign fund-raising practices in the United States, and that they are far less prone to corruption than counterparts in other countries.
"I believe that compared with any other parliament or democratic assembly in the world, we are the least corrupt," Sir Geoffrey Johnson Smith, the Conservative who heads the Select Committee on Members' Interests, said at a Parliament hearing last year.
Mr. Gallie, the M.P. who is paid by Scottish Power, has faced questions about his relationship with the company from Labor legislators. They have criticized his support for a plan by Scottish Power to build large power transmission pylons across a neighboring district despite the opposition of some residents.
Mr. Gallie said the pylons were part of a plan by Scottish Power to export electricity to Northern Ireland, a plan that he said would create jobs in Scotland. He said his support for the plan was based on the economic interests of his constituents and of Scotland, not on what is best for Scottish Power.
 
Making Up Salary Difference
 In an interview, Mr. Gallie declined to say how much he is paid by Scottish Power, though he did say that it is substantially less than the rumored $30,000 a year. He said the amount represents the difference between his salary up until 1992 as a power station manager for the company, before his election to Parliament, and his current $50,000 salary as an M.P. Lobbyists said $15,000 a year would be a common payment from a big company to an M.P. hired as a consultant.
For his money, Mr. Gallie said, he provides Scottish Power with information about legislation, advises the company about whom to make contact with about particular issues in the Government and the bureaucracy and occasionally arranges meetings.
His constituents benefit because when they have a problem or question regarding Scottish Power, he can get quick action, he said.
"I see no reason why people shouldn't use their talents in some way as long as they put their constituents first," Mr. Gallie said. "If money were to be the only criteria, a lot of people with talent wouldn't make the financial sacrifice to come to the House of Commons."

HEADLINE: Embargo Dries Up Haiti Fuel Supply

BYLINE: By RICK BRAGG, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, Aug. 23

 BODY:
The sweating and ragged men and women who sell gasoline in the black market on the side of the road here have a saying: you never appreciate the tail of a donkey until you try to catch one running downhill.
In one more absurdity in an absurd place and time, the United States and relief groups may have to rely on this market to power hospital generators and the trucks that take food and medicine to Haiti's poor in a nation slowly being squeezed dry by an international embargo. 
 The United States, which is trying to put soldiers on the border between Haiti and the Dominican Republic to stop the flow of smuggled gasoline and diesel fuel, and whose warships prowl offshore to stop other fuel from being slipped into the country, might have to buy smuggled fuel in the name of relief.
 
'Can't Let People Starve'
 "We can't let people starve," said Stanley Schrager, a spokesman for the United States Embassy in Port-au-Prince. "These are crucial programs, and we will not let these programs die."
The money would have to come from special appropriations, he said.
The problem is that the Haitian Government, while not formally seizing or illegally stealing it, has refused to release some 500,000 gallons of fuel donated by the United States and other countries for relief purposes.
The feeding centers and hospitals have fuel for a few more days, and some perhaps for a few weeks. But if the fuel is not released soon, or if the military government seizes it for its own use, as some relief workers fear, Washington will have to find another source, Mr. Schrager said.
The smuggled gasoline is the only option. Mr. Schrager refuses to call it black-market fuel, choosing instead to call it "spot market."
Regardless of the term, the United States Embassy has been buying the fuel to run its cars and for other needs for weeks now. There is nowhere else.
When asked why the United States does not simply let more fuel into the country, he replied, "If you lift the embargo, you will never get the military out."
 
Embargo Brings Suffering
 And the United Nations embargo is working, people in the streets say, if you rate success by how much people are suffering.
Even as a spotlight in the Caribbean shifts to the flood of refugees from Cuba, the tensions here are increasing. Now, even the wealthiest Haitians are beginning to grumble about runaway food prices, shortages and wildly rising inflation. "There is no one here tonight to drink," said one Haitian bar owner, a member of the country's elite, "because there is no gas to get here."
For perhaps the first time, it is becoming clear that the embargo is affecting all parts of the society, Mr. Schrager said. "And creating a rising level of frustration," he added.
The inflation rate is dizzying. From the traditional 5 Haitian gourdes to the American dollar, the currency's value fell to more than 23 gourdes to the dollar in just a few weeks.
And the phenomenon shows no sign of stopping. While Government officials have refused to comment on it, people in all of Haiti's economic classes say it is only a matter of time -- perhaps a few weeks -- before the economy begins to collapse.
In the last two months, the price of gasoline has skyrocketed from roughly $2.50 a gallon to $8 and climbing, so expensive that most of the tap-taps, as the taxis are known, simply no longer run. The roads are clogged not with cars but with people, many of them well-dressed members of the middle class who walk as far as five miles to work.
 
Military Hoards Gasoline
 The military is hoarding its own supply of gasoline, but the civilians have to buy theirs on the market.
"Wouldn't it be funny," said one middle-class Haitian, who spoke on condition of anonymity, "if the rich people and the poor people got so mad they joined together and tossed the military out?"
There are now signs of impatience in the city's slums, and continuing signs of fragmentation in the ranks of the civilian supporters of the military junta.
Earlier this week, plainclothes supporters of the military government went through the slum called Cite Soleil, beating people with sticks and threatening them with guns and machetes, apparently because there had been rumors of a coming uprising.
And on Sunday, two pro-military gunmen, referred to here as attaches, were found dead in one of the slums, their arms bound behind their backs and shot in the head.
But some Haitians said it was more than likely that the men had been killed by other attaches because of some internal dispute than by people loyal to the Rev. Jean Bertrand Aristide, the President who was chased out of the country by a coup in September 1991.
"But it shows," said one Haitian, who asked not to be identified, "that things are getting more difficult, for everyone."

United States relief groups say they may have to start buying the smuggled gas soon in order to keep up the flow of food and medicine to Haiti's poor. (Angel Franco/The New York Times)

Study of Sign Language Booming at Rochester

 BODY:
After Spanish and French, the most popular foreign language at the University of Rochester is American Sign Language.
More than 120 sophomores, juniors and seniors have already pre-registered for American Sign Language 101, filling six sections and squeezing out most freshmen. 
 The number exceeds the number of students enrolled in German, Italian, Russian, Arabic, Hebrew, Japanese, Greek and Latin, said Ted Supalla, the director of Rochester's sign-language program. The number of sign-language courses has more than doubled over the past two years.
Two years of studying sign language satisfies the university's foreign-language requirement, but students and teachers say the interest stems from other factors: a desire to communicate with the large deaf community in Rochester, home to the National Institute of Technology for the Deaf; careers in health or social services, or simply a new challenge.
Only a handful of colleges and universities around the country offer extensive sign-language programs. Rochester began its program in 1988 with one part-time instructor. There are now four instructors, a translator and two administrators.
Except for the very first day, all classes are taught entirely in sign language. Second-year classes teach students how to conduct more complex conversations, and there are upper-level courses in the history and culture of sign language, sociolinguistics and literature. This fall, a deaf graduate student from Japan will teach Japanese Sign Language.
The university also now has a sign language club.
"I know Spanish and French have practical uses," said one of the club's founders, Jill C. Bernstein, a junior majoring in an interdisciplinary program called health and society. "But you don't see people around campus speaking Spanish or French. I see people sitting at tables in the student union signing all the time."
 
UMass Freezes Tuition and Fees
 The University of Massachusetts at Amherst has frozen tuition and mandatory fees for the first time in 29 years after an intense lobbying effort by students, parents and school officials succeeded in getting the State Legislature to allocate more money for higher education.
Students at the university, one of the most expensive state universities in the country, had been protesting the continually rising costs -- by more than 25 percent in some years -- and one day in February they occupied the admissions building for nearly 20 hours to demand a tuition freeze.
The administration responded by agreeing to keep tuition and fees at $5,467 a year, the same as 1993-94, if the Legislature would increase state aid by at least the amount of the rise in the cost of living.
The students then took on the Legislature.
"We called all the parents of all the students who live in districts represented by members of the House Ways and Means Committee," said Mirran Raphaely, a 20-year-old junior from Worcester, Mass., who is president of the university's Student Government Association. "We got 4,000 parents to say they would call."
It worked. A $6.3 million increase in state appropriations was needed to freeze tuition at the university's Amherst campus. The five-campus system got an increase of $15 million.
 
Truth in Grades, Dartmouth Style
 While Stanford University has taken on grade inflation by bringing back the failing grade and giving more C's and D's, Dartmouth College is trying another approach: more information on report cards.
Beginning this fall with the class of '98, the college will include class size and median grades on students' transcripts. Grade inflation on the Hanover, N.H., campus has been gradual, to 3.23 in 1992-93 from 3.06 in 1976-77, on a 4.0 scale.
"Grades, without putting them into some sort of context, mean little," said Gary Johnson, a chemistry professor and the chairman of a faculty committee that proposed the change.
But some professors said the new system, based on one used at McGill University in Montreal, would increase competition among students. It will "pit one student against another," Delo Mook, a physics professor, told The Dartmouth, the daily student newspaper. "I don't think that's something we want to encourage."
One student leader said it was a worthy idea, but the wrong approach. "I think bringing institutions like Dartmouth back to a point where you are actually earning a grade, not getting a grade, but really working and learning and earning a grade is important," said the summer student-body president, Grace Chionuma, a 19-year-old junior. "But I think that struggle begins with the faculty, it doesn't begin with the student transcripts. This seems a very roundabout way of getting to a central issue."

HEADLINE: FLIGHT FROM CUBA: IN HAVANA;
Silent Castro Puzzling U.S. Aides

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MIAMI, Aug. 23

 BODY:
After encouraging an immigration crisis with the United States by permitting disgruntled Cubans to take to the high seas, Fidel Castro has suddenly and unexpectedly fallen silent, raising concerns about what additional moves he might be planning.
Normally not a man at a loss for words, the Cuban leader has made no significant public statements since President Clinton announced on Saturday that Cuban-Americans will no longer be allowed to visit or send remittances to relatives on the island and that anti-Castro broadcasts to Cuba will be increased. 
 The few pronouncements out of Havana in recent days have come from lower-ranking officials and do not directly address the Clinton Administration measures.
Mr. Castro's uncharacteristic reticence has both American officials and other Cuba analysts baffled. They say that he probably did not expect the Clinton Administration to respond with harsh punitive measures to his threat to unleash another uncontrolled exodus of Cuban refugees on Florida, and is pondering what to do next.
 
Response Is Studied
 "The Cubans tend to respond relatively rapidly to things," one State Department official said today. "On the other hand, the fact that they have not said much of anything may be an indication that they are reflecting on how they should respond."
Wayne Smith, a former head of the United States Interests Section in Havana, said, "I think they have realized that the United States is not going to discuss anything with them." Mr. Smith, who visited Cuba last week, said the Cuban Government appeared to be considering economic reforms that could lessen food shortages on the island, but had not reached a decision.
Speaking of the possibility of an economic reform package that would allow farmers to sell some of their crops on the open market, Mr. Smith said he had been told that "Fidel is dead set against it, but Raul and the military are pressing for it." He was referring to Mr. Castro's younger brother Raul, who is Minister of Defense.
The only senior Cuban official to have commented in any detail on the Clinton Administration's new policy is Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina, who is on an official visit to six South and Central American countries aimed at lessening Cuba's diplomatic isolation. Arriving in Santiago, Chile, late on Monday, Mr. Robaina described relations between the United States and Cuba as "extremely tense" and said they would "heat up" as a result of the decision to send Cuban refugees to Guantanamo Bay naval base.
 
Guantanamo Issue Assailed
 "Without Cuban emigrants, this base continues to be worthy of condemnation," he said. "With Cuban emigrants, I think that, to sum things up, it can make this tense relationship even more dangerous."
Those comments have been echoed in Cuba's Government-controlled press. In a broadcast from Havana monitored here today, Radio Rebelde warned that Cuban refugees at Guantanamo "could be used for acts of provocation or as cannon fodder" in the event of hostilities between the United States and Cuba.
At his news conference in Chile, Mr. Robaina also scoffed at a statement by Leon Panetta, White House Chief of Staff, that the United States was considering the possibility of imposing a blockade on Cuba. "Threats don't frighten us, because Cuba has been living with threats for 34 years," he said.
At the same time, however, Mr. Robaina repeated Cuba's longstanding desire to sit down with American officials to discuss a whole gamut of differences. "The problem is not purely one of migration, it is much more than that," he said.
Mr. Castro's sudden silence contrasts sharply with his actions earlier this month, when he denounced the United States in a series of speeches and news conferences. On Aug. 5, after rioters in downtown Havana clashed with police and chanted "Down with Fidel!" Mr. Castro was speaking on Cuban television when he was handed a note that he said contained a threat from the head of the United States Interest Section in Havana "that a serious situation would develop" if the Cuban leader did not abandon his aggressive talk.
"Well, I am not only speaking, but also confirming this point," Mr. Castro then said. He added, referring to the American policy of treating Cuban boat people as political refugees: "Anyone can see that the country cannot allow these things to happen and just sit back with folded arms."
That speech and others that Mr. Castro delivered later make it clear that he blames the United States for the current crisis. In particular, the Cuban leader has argued that the only thing that distinguishes the flow of people out of Cuba from that in other Latin American countries is Washington's three-decade-old policy of isolating Cuba economically.

HEADLINE: FLIGHT FROM CUBA: ON THE AIRWAVES;
U.S. Government Broadcasts to Cuba, And Wonders If Anyone Is Listening

BYLINE: By CATHERINE S. MANEGOLD, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 23

 BODY:
Hour after hour, the airwaves in Cuba are filled with a single message: Don't go.
In Spanish, from antiseptic United States Government studios here, the reasons are listed again and again: The waters are unsafe. Hurricane season has started. People are dying. American policy has changed. There is no welcome for survivors. Refugees are detained. Don't go. 
 Radio Marti's transmissions blanket most of Cuba. Yet the refugees keep coming, day by day surging into the choppy seas and confounding those who fear yet more death in the Straits of Florida.
"They want us to warn people," said Margarita Rojo, the harried general manager of the United States Government's Radio Marti. "We are the only link some Cubans have to what is happening."
In an emergency intensification of its message, Radio Marti, a Ronald Reagan brainchild designed to beam democracy toward one of the hemisphere's last Communist hold-out, nearly doubled its capacity to transmit today, said Richard M. Lobo, the director of the Office of Cuban Broadcasting, a division of the United States Information Agency.
By adding four new Voice of America shortwave channels to the six it already uses, radio experts hope to jump the program across the dial like a nervous mouse to evade jamming devices, which Mr. Lobo says are used by the Castro Government in Havana.
A medium-wave signal, 1180 AM, transmitted from a military base in Marathon Key, Fla., is surging from 50 kilowatts to 100, Mr. Lobo said. And a television signal will be staying on the air from 3:30 A.M. until 8 A.M., three hours longer than usual, starting on Wednesday.
The programming has changed, too. In the past four days, news broadcasts have doubled in length and a skeletal staff reduced by summer vacations has struggled to produce special commentary shows and news alerts.
 
'We Are All Exhausted'
 "It's crazy," Ms. Rojo said. "Today is worse than yesterday. Yesterday was worse than the day before. We are all exhausted."
The emergency expansion, called for by President Clinton in a news conference last week, but not made until today, is hoped to work on both a practical and a political level. By telling Cubans not to head to sea, the Administration wants to stop the exodus while underscoring its message that Castro's reaction may be costing perhaps thousands of Cubans their lives.
"With these new frequencies we should be able to break through loud and clear," said Rolando Bonachea, Radio Marti's director. "There is a human tragedy unfolding."
The Radio Marti staff has scrambled for days to alert Cubans to shifts in the Clinton Administration's policy and to reach out to a country many once called home. The staff says the station's mission is balanced, fair journalism. As the crisis has unfolded, the station's programmers have sought to include voices both supporting and opposing Mr. Clinton's sudden shift on the issue of refugees.
But the delicacies of working with the Government as boss seem clear, if sometimes subtle. When one man was widely quoted saying that he would rather be in Haiti than in Cuba, the reference was cut in deference to the State Department's ongoing struggles over restoring democracy in Haiti.
More often, though, the immediate challenge is simply meeting deadlines. Barred from traveling to Cuba, the staff tries to reach out by telephone and through a network of stringers. At one desk for the past several days, Elizardo San Pedro Marin has spent hour after hour trying to reach Cuba by telephone. Most conversations abruptly end moments after the connection is made, presumably because of interference from Castro's government.
 
Nothing Is Normal
 These days, almost nothing is normal. Even the station's once reliable mix of talk shows, news bites, salsa music and soap operas has been transformed. The staff has toned down music and entertainment programs both to make way for news and not to seem to make light of an escalating tragedy.
Since its first broadcast on Cuban Independence Day, May 20, 1985, Radio Marti has operated with built-in obsolescence in mind. Always, its success was defined as Fidel Castro's failure.
Yet now that political and economic tensions in Havana have boiled into the warm waters off Florida, the radio is reporting not on a celebration but on an agonizing drama that, for many, involves countrymen and relatives.
"It's your own people," said Camelia Townsend, the station's Cuba-born director of the evening news. "When you see people and they say they would rather go to Haiti than stay in Cuba, it hurts, it is very emotional. I can't hold back the tears."
The lighter moments that remain sometimes sound dissonant. Monday, the station fluttered between "The Passion of Sylvia Eugenia," a saga of a woman in the midst of a divorce because she has fallen passionately in love with a man about to be married to another woman, and news reports that listed the names of Cubans detained at the Krome Detention Center in Miami.
On Monday, the news staff fretted over reports of 1,000 bodies washed up in brackish waters near Havana. The numbers added up. All day Sunday, a Miami-based group called Los Hermanos de Rescate, or Brothers to the Rescue, called in with reports of up to 200 rafts adrift.
"There were probably four to six people per raft," said Ms. Rojo, pulling on a cigarette and pacing in a light rain during a short break. "You multiply it. That's 1,000 dead. But we can't report it because we can't be sure of our sources."
That caution is perhaps heightened for Radio Marti's employees. "We'd rather be last than wrong," Mr. Lobo said. "Too many people listen to us, too many people believe us for us to take any chances."
Tonight, as the station prepared to stretch its reach even further, the staff could only hope that someone out there was listening.

Dollar Down Against Yen After Rise in Early Trading

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar ended trading with little change yesterday after an early surge on signs that Japan's central bank bought dollars to brake its slide against the Japanese yen.
"The Bank of Japan bought pretty aggressively last night," said Joe Francomano, a trader at Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank. 
 But the dollar gave back most of its gains in the afternoon after an influential economist predicted that trade tensions between Washington and Tokyo would push the dollar to a new low against the yen. It did manage to recover against the Mexican peso, however.
The dollar rose as high as 98.54 yen, before ending the day at 97.82 yen, down from 97.85 yen on Monday. It also rose to 1.5315 German marks from 1.5288 marks.
 
Traders Cite Bank Moves
 Traders in Tokyo said the central bank began buying dollars in Asian trading. The Bank of Japan declined to comment. The central bank's purchases, which have often proved ineffective, helped drive the dollar higher early yesterday because many traders were short the American currency, Mr. Francomano said.
In a short sale, traders sell borrowed dollars, hoping to buy dollars at a lower rate later to cover the borrowing; the difference is profit. The Bank of Japan's purchases forced them to buy dollars back to pare losses, Mr. Francomano said.
The Bank of Japan has spent trillions of yen buying dollars this year trying to keep the yen from strengthening. A strong yen makes Tokyo's exports more expensive.
 
Bergsten Comments
 But in late New York trading, the dollar pulled back after C. Fred Bergsten, an independent Washington economist with close ties to the Clinton Administration, was quoted as having said that the dollar might fall to new lows against the yen because of the standoff in American-Japanese trade negotiations over government contracts. The dollar's current postwar low is 96.60 yen, set on July 12.
"Bergsten's comments hit a nerve," said David De Rosa, director of foreign-exchange trading at the Swiss Bank Corporation. Traders eager to sell the dollar when it rose saw his comments as justification for doing so, he said.
The United States has set a Sept. 30 deadline for talks aimed at getting Japanese Government agencies to buy more American medical and telecommunications equipment. Otherwise, the Administration may impose sanctions on Japanese exports.
The dollar often falls against the yen when Washington talks tough on trade because many traders suspect that the White House will call for a strong yen to put pressure on Japan.
The dollar, meanwhile, rebounded against the Mexican peso, which rallied to a three-month high against the dollar on Monday after preliminary results of the Mexican election. The dollar traded at 3.3420 pesos today in the spot market, up from 3.3375 pesos on Monday.

Drought in Parts of Brazil Pushes Coffee Prices Higher

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Coffee prices surged yesterday on continuing concerns that dry weather in Brazil will further damage a crop already harmed by two frosts.
Some parts of Brazil's coffee-growing regions have had no rain for a month, and no rain is forecast for the rest of the week. Brazil is the world's leading coffee producer. 
 "It continues to be dry there," said Oscar Schaps, a coffee broker with Hencorp Coffee Group in Miami. "The critical time is in two weeks. If it's still dry then," prices could surge again, he said.
At the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York, coffee for December delivery rose 8.1 cents, to $1.976 a pound, its highest price in a week. Coffee has surged 7.5 percent in the last two days.
The dry weather in Brazil comes after two frosts in the growing regions during June and July, eliminating an estimated 40 percent of next year's crop. Traders still do not know the full extent of the frost damage.
"I'm bullish in general," said John Rapinchuk, controller at Knutsen Coffees Ltd. in San Francisco. Even though 20 million bags of coffee stored in producing countries would cover the decline in Brazil's crop, he said, "If we don't get the traditional rain that starts the flowering in September and October, then there'll be additional difficulties."
On other commodity markets, crude oil gained and lumber fell. The Commodity Research Bureau's index rose 0.42 point, to 228.91.
Crude oil prices rebounded from their lowest levels since early May, and traders cited optimism that a surge in demand this winter will absorb higher production in the North Sea during the next two months. Crude oil for October delivery rose 19 cents, to $17.09, a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
After the market closed, the American Petroleum Institute said crude oil stockpiles fell 2.8 million barrels, less than 1 percent, while gasoline inventories were lower.
Elsewhere, lumber prices slumped on traders' expectations for a slowdown in the housing market. September lumber futures dropped the $10 daily trading limit, to $357.20 for 1,000 board feet, on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
"You're over the peak of the housing market, and now you're coming into an area where you have to be concerned," said Curt Cunningham, president of the Pacific Futures Trading Company in Seattle. "Housing has been negatively impacted by the rise in interest rates."

HEADLINE: Market Place;
California's plan to control insurance rates stirs industry ire.

BYLINE: By Michael Quint 

 BODY:
SHOULD insurance companies be treated like utilities, with state regulators controlling their prices so that no company makes too much profit, or too little?
That is the approach being adopted in California, where the state's Supreme Court last week upheld the voter-approved Proposition 103, which requires the insurance commissioner's approval before companies can change prices. The court also supported the commissioner's right to approve insurance prices by a formula that sets a range of profits, expressed as a rate of return on the capital, that each company would be allowed. 
 Insurance companies have been fighting the plan for seven years. Now, they are gaining new support from investors and analysts who contend that the state-set rate of return will discourage insurance companies from expanding in California and deter investors from buying stock of companies with a concentration of business in California.
Some analysts expect that the new rules, if they are not overturned in an appeal to the United States Supreme Court, will prompt companies to begin reallocating costs, revenues and capital to minimize the California constraint on profits.
"I don't think the doomsday scenarios of a massive flight by companies out of the California market will happen, just because the forces of inertia are so powerful," said Orin S. Kramer, a director of a private investment partnership and a former consultant for the insurance industry. "But if there was a company planning a public stock issue whose business was concentrated in California, I don't think that stock issue would sell."
Even if the California commissioner adopts regulations allowing companies to set prices that result in a more generous return than the 10 percent target set in the late 1980's, investors worry that insurance company profits will be vulnerable to attacks by commissioners looking to raise their popularity before the next election. And, they say, utility-style regulation has no place in the insurance industry, particularly in a competitive state like California where 700 companies offer a wide range of prices and service.
"Borrowing the principles of utility regulation and applying them to the insurance industry makes no sense," said David Snyder, assistant general counsel for the American Insurance Association. "With utilities that operate as monopolies, government should have a wide role in rate regulation to protect consumers who have no choice about where they buy their electricity. But insurance is a competitive industry where consumers do have choices."
Despite such concern, only a few companies have been hurt in the stock market. Shares of Twentieth Century Insurance and the Mercury General Corporation, two highly profitable auto insurers with a business concentration in California, have declined 23 percent and 5.3 percent, respectively, since the court decision.
Other companies are either mutually owned like State Farm, the state's largest insurer, with no stock to be traded; have only a small part of their business in California, like Allstate, or are owned by large foreign companies like B.A.T. Industries of Britain and Allianz of Germany.
John Snyder, senior vice president at A. M. Best, the insurance rating firm, said the new regulatory arrangement could backfire for California consumers, despite the one-time refunds of $100 or more ordered by Proposition 103.
In the past, he said, the best-run companies, like Twentieth Century Insurance, could make high profits and at the same time offer their customers prices and service that were among the best in the state. "But if their profits are capped, you may not get that kind of success story in the future," he said. The inefficient companies, he added, may be more comfortable with the profit target, since they were not highly profitable anyway, and may endure longer if better run companies avoid the state.
The formulas for the target rates of return are expected to be published within a few months, or shortly before the end of the term in office of John Garamendi, the insurance commissioner. In 1989 the commissioner set a 10 percent return target when calculating the rebates companies should pay under Proposition 103.
A 10 percent return is well below the 18.2 percent five-year average for the 50 best-run property and casualty insurers, but differs little from the industry average of 10.6 percent, according to the Ward Financial Group of Cincinnati.
Mr. Garamendi said fears of an excessively low target for rates of return were misplaced, because there would be an adjustment for efficiency so that well-run companies could earn more. The target rates of return will also vary, he said, with changes in economic conditions, such as inflation and interest rates.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
New Game In Town As Baseball Talks Begin

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
In place of the usual position-by-position matchups that precede the World Series, Major League Baseball was left yesterday with a matchup of verbal positions by owners and players as they prepared for their first face-to-face bargaining-table confrontation of the 13-day-old strike.
The positions, as articulated by John Harrington of the Boston Red Sox and Brett Butler of the Los Angeles Dodgers, spelled out in painfully precise terms where each side stands for today's session in the presence of a team of Federal mediators. 
 Harrington, the Red Sox's chief executive officer, and Butler, the Dodgers' veteran center fielder, offered their positions after each side met with John Calhoun Wells, director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, and three aides, Wilma Liebman, John Martin and Brian Flores.
At the meetings -- three and a half hours for the owners, two hours for the players -- the mediators determined that each side was willing to permit as many representatives of the other side to attend today's session as each wanted.
 
15 Players Expected
 Donald Fehr, the players' labor leader, said he expected about 15 players to join their negotiators. Richard Ravitch, management's chief labor executive, did not say how many of the 12-person team of owners and club executives would be present, but all 12 were expected at the 10:30 A.M. meeting at the Hotel Intercontinental in Manhattan.
Harrington, serving as a spokesman for the owner-executive group assigned to meet with the players, said he had been impressed listening to the members speak during the previous 24 hours.
"Everyone had a different way of articulating their concerns for the economics of the game," Harrington said at a news conference, "but the unanimity of the final message was that we have to bring about some fundamental change to the player compensation system in order to insure the future viability of the game. That's where we've been at; that's where we're still at."
 
Owners Hold Ground
 In other words, at the bargaining session, the owners will adhere to the salary cap they desperately want to implement to control their player costs.
Butler, speaking at a later news conference, was equally clear on the players' position.
"You sit and talk about salary caps as they have," he said as the strike brought to 155 the number of games lost. "Representing the players behind me and the other 750 as well, absolutely there's no way the players are going to go with a salary cap. If they understand that, which we hope they do, and they can come in tomorrow with the thought process that there isn't going to be a salary cap, now let's fix it. We want to play baseball, but we are not going to play baseball with the thought process of a salary cap existing in this industry. It just will not happen."
 
'A Lot of Golf'
 And a minute later, he added, "If they stick to the salary cap, guys are going to play a lot of golf."
Butler was one of 18 players who attended the meeting with the mediators. Eleven owners and club executives went to the management session. David Glass, chairman of the Kansas City Royals, was the missing person for the second straight day.
When mediators last week announced the resumption of talks -- the two sides haven't met since Aug. 12, the first day of the strike -- they talked of five owners joining the talks. When Bud Selig, the acting commissioner, appointed his 12-person squad, he did not specify a first team and a second team, but a group of five was designated just in case only five would meet with the players.
Ravitch played down the talk that had been generated by the first team-second team approach.
"This game of which owner is present, which owner is sitting in which seat takes attention away from the central subject, which is the issue," he said. "We have a strike going on. We are trying to bring this to a resolution. Let's keep our eye on that ball. The outcome of that is not going to be affected by which particular owner is going to be sitting in which particular chair at any given moment in time."
Fehr said he didn't think the owners asked to have their whole team at the table as much as they suggested it.
 
'Rotating Groups' Unusual
 "We'd be more than happy to have them do it," Fehr said. "It seemed sort of unusual to have rotating groups."
Neither Ravitch nor Fehr would discuss the specific matters they covered in their meetings with the mediators. But Ravitch said, "At the moment, the mediators are primarily listening."
The meeting with the union, Fehr said, made "the mediators aware of how the players feel individually. This no longer is staff speaking for a group. These are individuals."
At their news conference, Ravitch and Harrington made some comments that were confusing enough to prompt speculation that the owners might have something different to present to the players.
When asked if the owners would have a different proposal, Ravitch said: "I am not going to comment on that, the question of whether we take a proposal to the table tomorrow or not. I don't want to suggest by my silence on this subject that there's going to be a proposal, that that proposal is going to be of a particular nature at all."
 
'The Central Issue'
 But then he added: "It's fair to say the owners are not going to change their view that the issue of cost certainty, the nexis between revenues and costs, are the central issue in this negotiation. We are not going to change our view on that tomorrow."
Harrington was asked if he had learned "anything new" yesterday.
"Yes," he replied, "but I can't discuss it." Later he was asked about it again and said, "I don't want to talk anymore about what went on today."
Harrington did say the owners-executives were prepared to remain in New York for further meetings if they are scheduled.
"Eleven and hopefully 12 will stay here for as long as it takes, as long as there's productive dialogue," he said, adding he hoped the two sides would continue meeting after today's session.
Ravitch said he hoped the sessions would be conducted on a high level and not include the name-calling he declined to become involved in the day before. But he couldn't resist taking a swipe at Fehr.
"Don said yesterday I've never run a team," Ravitch said. "I've never seen Don's picture in a uniform on a playing card, either."

HEADLINE: Wine Talk;
2 1/2 Decades Later, A Very Good Year

BYLINE: By Frank J. Prial 

 BODY:
THEY will be celebrating a milestone at Opus One next week. Opus One is the name of a winery, an architectural tour de force in the Napa Valley in California; it's also the name of its wine.
The celebration is for the 1991 vintage, the first to be made at the winery. But the party has been almost 25 years in the making, having survived big egos, a big price on the wine, a big construction problem and a serious disease in the vines. 
 The idea for Opus One was born at a wine and spirits industry convention in Hawaii in 1970 when Baron Philippe de Rothschild casually proposed it to Robert Mondavi, the California wine maker. Baron Philippe was the owner of Chateau Mouton-Rothschild, one of the most famous wine properties in France, at Pauillac, near Bordeaux. Mr. Mondavi's winery in the Napa Valley had opened to almost instant acclaim only four years earlier.
The two men met again in 1978, at Chateau Mouton-Rothschild. After 25 minutes of discussion, they agreed on the outlines of a joint wine making venture. They would create a California wine combining the best of two worlds, or more precisely, two wine regions, Bordeaux and the Napa Valley.
The two men had much in common, even though one was the son of poor Italian immigrants and the other a scion of one of the wealthiest families in Europe. Both had been athletes in their youth. Both were restless innovators. Both were clever showmen possessed of outsize egos.
Baron Philippe loved California. Briefly during the 1930's, he had dabbled in Hollywood as a producer. After World War II, he and his wife, Pauline Fairfax Potter, an American, vacationed regularly in Santa Barbara. In the early 1970's, the French economy was more unstable than usual, and the booming California wine business seemed like a most prudent investment.
For the visionary Mr. Mondavi, the French connection offered a partner with deep pockets and a measure of prestige that was undreamed of in the days when, as a boy, he had nailed together crates for shipping cheap grapes to the East Coast.
The project moved along rapidly. Even the unusual name of the red wine was chosen quickly.
According to one version of the event, Baron Philippe called from Paris and suggested Opus. Mr. Mondavi demurred; it was too musical.
Two days later the Baron called back. "How about Opus One?" he said. And that was it.
Until a separate winery was built, Opus One would be made from Mondavi grapes at the Mondavi winery in Oakville. Mouton-Rothschild would supply its wine makers and oak barrels for aging and would underwrite other costs. The first vintage was in 1979. The Opus One telephone number commemorates that year: 963-1979.
Thanks to a carefully orchestrated promotional campaign, the 1979 vintage was in demand almost from the time the grapes were picked. One case went for $24,000 at a charity auction three years before the wine was sold commercially.
When the 1979 vintage was released in 1984 -- simultaneously with the 1980 vintage -- it was obvious that a star had been born, even though it cost $50 a bottle, which was then a startling price. Opus One was truly a California wine with a French pedigree.
That same year, 1984, the Mondavis and the Rothschilds chose Johnson, Fain & Pereira Associates, architects in Los Angeles, to design their winery. By then, Baron Philippe's daughter, Philippine, was leading the French half of the Opus One team on behalf of her aging father, then 82. The Baron died in 1988.
The architects drew up plans for a building, across the highway from the Robert Mondavi Winery, that would have 80,000 square feet of space, of which 15,000 square feet would be reserved for a huge, curved barrel room. Throughout the wine making process, an ingenious gravity-flow system would eliminate the need to pump juice or wine from one level to another. The winery was budgeted at $10 million. Construction started in July 1989 and was finished in December 1991.
Then misfortune struck. Twice.
The plan was to bury much of the winery below ground, for natural cooling. The engineers discovered, too late, that the building was sitting on an exceptionally high water table. What's more, it was found to be close to geothermal springs that raised the ground temperature to about 72 degrees. An expensive cooling system had to be devised and installed.
Meanwhile, a new phylloxera epidemic had begun to destroy California's vineyards. Phylloxera is an aphid that feeds on grapevine roots. In the late 19th century, the bug, which originated in this country, wiped out most of the world's vineyards. Only the discovery of phylloxera-resistant rootstocks enabled the wine business to survive. Since the bug works only underground, the vulnerable vines can be grafted, above ground, to the resistant roots.
A new strain of the bug, which attacks rootstocks once considered impervious to it, has forced extensive replantings in California. In 1990, 40 of Opus One's 75 acres of vines were found to be infected and had to be replaced. Thus, 15 years after its first vintage, the wine is still being made with grapes from vineyards owned or leased by the Mondavi winery. "We expect Opus One to be made entirely from its own grapes in three, maybe four years," Mr. Mondavi said.
New construction and replanting increased the cost of the Opus One winery. The winery's management said the final cost was $15 million, although industry estimates have put it as high as $25 million.
The winery, which opened in 1991, has been variously described as a space station, a Mayan temple and a futuristic mausoleum. In fact, it's a strikingly handsome structure built from white Texas limestone and untreated redwood and filled with imported antiques. Its elegance, inside and out, reflects the elegance of its wine and to some extent perhaps the almost casual excess of the mid-1980's.
The wine, a blend predominantly of cabernet sauvignon, with cabernet franc and merlot, has maintained its quality and popularity through the 13 vintages released to date. It is one of the most expensive wines produced in this country: its recent vintages sell for about $65 a bottle, and older ones, when they turn up, can bring $200 or more.
Production began at about 12,000 cases in 1979. Some 27,000 cases of the 1991 vintage were bottled last year, according to winery figures. Production should eventually level off at 30,000 cases, Mr. Mondavi said.
Opus One sells around the world -- except, it seems, in France.
"The French are amused by Opus One," Baroness Philippine said. "They're interested, but they're not for the moment prepared to buy it."

TASTINGS
Les Jamelles Mourvedre, Vin de Pays d'Oc (France), 1992; about $5.
 
This is yet another contender in the new wave of varietal wines from the Midi, the south of France. Les Jamelles is the brand name, and mourvedre is the name of the grape from which this particular red wine is made. After a century or so of turning out mostly junk, the Midi is switching to good wines. The growers have learned that the day of cheap but vile wine has passed. Vineyards have been replanted, and wine makers are changing to the American system of identifying wines by the name of the grape -- like this one -- instead of by geographic area. Historically, mourvedre was a hot-climate grape that produced a dry, astringent wine used mostly in blending. Les Jamelles mourvedre has none of the harsh tannins of old; it is smooth, medium bodied, easy to drink and attractively packaged. It also has the advantage of being native to the area in which it is made -- more than can be said for some of the inexpensive cabernets and chardonnays from the same torrid climes.

HEADLINE: Long Island's Wines Gain in Stature

BYLINE: By HOWARD G. GOLDBERG 

 BODY:
LONG ISLAND is steadily emerging as New York State's signature wine region, as maturing producers offer ever more sophisticated whites and reds to a growing clientele.
The wine business is only 21 years old on the East End of Long Island, and many of the wineries are less than half that age. But with the trial-and-error fumblings of the early years largely behind them, Suffolk County's leading producers are seeing sales rise along with quality. 
 "Our first year's sales were about 3,500 cases," said Robert J. Palmer, whose Palmer Vineyards in Aque bogue, L.I., opened in 1986. "By the end of 1994, they should hit 12,000 to 12,500."
But it is proximity to New York City that gives the region its advantage. Many of the choicest wines from the 49 producers in the Finger Lakes area, the state's biggest winegrowing region, are sold only upstate; they rarely enter New York City's market and its East End orbit, which can build national reputations.
Because the East End's 16 wineries are so close to New York City, it is easy to attract New Yorkers' attention and to get products into New York retail stores and restaurants. Producers can also rebuild customers' inventories within a few hours.
"Long Island has clearly become No. 1 in importance in the state and elsewhere, because New York State is New York City," said Jon Newmark, the owner of Orange Plaza Wines and Liquors in Middletown, N.Y. "Long Island's proximity makes all the difference."
Gene Pierce, the president of Glenora, a major Finger Lakes producer, agreed. "It's hard to overcome the geography," he said. "Besides, we're agricultural. Long Island owners have been businessmen. They have had more experience in marketing and sales than we. We need to learn to cooperate to promote the region's reach and image."
And tourism on the East End, especially winery visits that often end in sales, is rising, said Carol Gristina of Gristina Vineyards in Cutchogue, L.I. "I noticed last year that our season has become longer," she said. "It used to be Memorial Day to Labor Day. Now it's the beginning of May through Thanksgiving."
East End wineries are open all year long, with seasonally adjusted hours. For day trippers, the region is 90 miles from midtown Manhattan, about a two-hour drive (the Finger Lakes are five hours away).
Knowledgeable wine buyers tend to head for Bedell, Gristina, Hargrave and Pellegrini, all in Cutchogue; Lenz and Pindar in Peconic; Palmer and Paumanok in Aquebogue, and Sagpond in Sagaponack.
"My favorite North Shore wine is Pindar's Special Reserve Sunflower Chardonnay," said Robert Bernstein, the general sales manager of WALK-AM and -FM, in Patchogue, and a frequent visitor to the wine country. "And Bidwell makes a good reserve merlot. In truth, I have not found Long Island's sparkling wines to be as good as those from California."
East End producers are elated by the 1993 vintage. They say the overall quality of last year's wines is the best ever (only a few '93's have been released). Alex Hargrave of Hargrave Vineyard in Cutchogue pronounced the '93 growing conditions virtually perfect from start to finish. "So far, '94 is on track with '93, and we have our fingers crossed," he said.
Mr. Palmer, of Palmer Vineyards, said: "Long Island is on a roll. The North Fork is New York City's Napa Valley."
Any hyperbole aside, visitors are more likely to confuse the North Fork with Indiana. Offering miles of flat fields, ponds, farm stands bending under vegetables and fruits, wooden frame houses, white clapboard churches, picket fences and old cemeteries, the area is rural and small-town middle American in appearance and spirit.
"On the North Fork you feel very far away from New York City," said Alice Kossin, a preschool teacher from Briarcliff Manor, N.Y., who was visiting the area recently. "This is our first visit. We'll be back. We hope to discover a small label and a wine we really love."
Producers are now introducing sophisticated agricultural and cellar techniques. And as their vines age, in good years they can deliver grapes of great complexity.
"By the standards of discerning wine lovers, most are turning out wines of fine quality," said Mary Ewing Mulligan, the director of the International Wine Center, a Manhattan wine school. "The wines are well made and typify their grape variety."
Many of the wineries are converted potato barns or barn knockoffs. Lenz occupies a funky old barn. Pindar's immense salesroom, lighted by a huge stained-glass window with a kitschy winegrowing motif and faux Tiffany lamps with grape motifs, seems perpetually thronged.
Pellegrini's two-story cathedral-like tasting room, buttressed by an oak post-and-beam frame, is the handsomest on the East End. Palmer's tasting room is furnished with remnants of a London pub.
Chardonnay and merlot are Long Island's top wines. Some chardonnays tend to be Chablis-like -- lighter, leaner and crisper than California's -- and the barrel-fermented versions somewhat Burgundian. The outstanding merlots, typically medium-bodied, stress lively aromas and flavors and, in ripe vintages, display plenty of meatiness and depth.
John Bedell -- Kip to everyone -- expressed barely restrained enthusiasm this spring as he poured opulent '93 samples of his regular and reserve merlots aging in American-oak barrels. Bedell merlots have steadily taken top honors in contests sponsored by the New York Wine and Grape Foundation, a trade group.
Mr. Bedell and everyone else have other specialties. Bedell's off-dry non-vintage Cygnet is a tasty blend of gewurztraminer and riesling grapes. Gristina is making a mark with pinot noir. Hargrave's cabernet franc can be profound. Pellegrini features a tantalizing off-dry blend of pinot blanc, chardonnay and gewurztraminer, called Commonage White.
Lenz's Alsace-style gewurztraminer and pinot blanc are delicious. Palmer's sauvignon blanc rises toward California's best. Pindar turns out a stylish sparkling wine, Cuvee Rare, wholly from pinot meunier grapes. Paumanok is making headway with riesling.
On the North Fork, two new producers are about to go into business. Osprey's Dominion, in Peconic, may open to the public in early September, said Bill Pollina, the general manager. Corey Creek in Southold plans to begin building a sales office in September, said Matthew C. Gillies, the vineyard manager. For the moment, both will feature chardonnays made for them by Dan Kleck at Palmer.
Long Island's wine industry was born in 1972, when Alex and Louisa Hargrave planted 17 acres of cabernet sauvignon, pinot noir and sauvignon blanc. Today, they have 50 acres under vines, and the region has at least 1,500, virtually all devoted to European vinifera grapes. (Nassau County, to the west of Suffolk, has two wineries.)
This spring, the East End Economic and Environmental Task Force estimated the total average annual production at 250,000 cases and sales at $27 million and said that 30 percent of all sales took place in the tasting rooms. Most premium wines range from $9 to $20 a bottle.
The revival of South Fork wine making was signaled in May when Dr. Herodotus Damianos, a Stony Brook, L.I., internist and the owner of Pindar, bought the nearly defunct Southampton Winery in Water Mill and its 56 acres for "more than $2 million," he said. He renamed it Duck Walk.
Dr. Damianos acquired the assets from Barclays Bank, which in 1992 foreclosed on the bankrupt winery, called Le Reve when it opened in 1987. The bank had held a $6.6 million mortgage. With 51,000 cases produced from the '93 vintage, Pindar is by far Long Island's biggest winery.
In May, Peter Carroll, who operates and has an option to buy Lenz, acquired the financially troubled Bridgehampton Winery, the East End's third-oldest winery.
Founded in 1989, the well-financed Sagpond Vineyards is the South Fork's newest producer. It features promising chardonnays and expects to start building a winery by next year.
In June, Mr. Palmer, of Palmer Vineyards, became the region's second-biggest grape-grower behind Dr. Damianos, who has 250 acres planted. Mr. Palmer bought the 52-acre Ressler Vineyards, a leading grape farm in Cutchogue, for $1 million, increasing his holdings to 88 acres.

HEADLINE: Why Punish the Cuban People?

 BODY:
President Clinton's abrupt reversal of 28 years of Cuban refugee policy last Friday looked clumsy enough, but over the weekend he made it worse. Seeking to punish Fidel Castro for unleashing the latest refugee tide, Mr. Clinton ended up also punishing ordinary Cubans. He cut off all cash support from their relatives in the U.S., rather than the 50 percent cut originally announced. By raising the temperature on Cuba when it should be trying to cool it, the Administration could yet convert a rhetorical emergency into a real one.
The package of pressures the President unveiled on Saturday did include two legitimate spurs to greater freedom in Cuba -- increased radio broadcasts and a new U.N. initiative on human rights. It also included a cutoff of charter flights from the U.S. -- unwise, since Cuban freedom is served by more contacts with Americans, not less. 
 The Administration suspended the payments because they not only help stretch family budgets but also provide hard currency to Havana as recipients exchange their dollars for goods in special Government-run stores. The policy seems designed to bring Cuba to a political boil by closing off the refugee safety valve and driving down living standards. Presumably that will hasten a popular revolt, but this course entails a pointless risk to the Cuban people since the Castro regime is already withering.
Even in decline, Mr. Castro has again shown his uncanny power to get Washington to tie itself in knots. Following a familiar pattern, the U.S. is overreacting to his provocations and letting domestic politics distort foreign policy priorities.
In any rational calculus, Mexico, with its 92 million people and a North American Free Trade Agreement, should be the Administration's main Latin concern following a critical and tense election. Instead all eyes are fixed on Cuba and continuing efforts to contain the refugee flow, promoted in one frantic day by Attorney General Janet Reno from non-problem to national emergency.
The Administration's new offensive against Havana is supported by Cuban-Americans, who were upset when Washington reclassified those who risk their lives to flee Mr. Castro's economically battered police state as "illegal immigrants" rather than refugees from tyranny. They believe the time has finally come to get rid of the Castro regime, and inflicting increased short-term pain on Cuba's people seems worth the long-term gain.
The voice of a million Cuban-Americans should be heard, but it should not be allowed to drive U.S. policy against humane values and larger national interests. Those values weigh against punishing innocent victims, and those interests do not include detonating a large explosion in the Caribbean. Discontented Cubans do not relish rising up only to be mowed down by a totalitarian regime. They would rather get out and start anew somewhere else. It is unconscionable for Washington to tell them, in effect, no, we will lock you in until you revolt.
Getting rid of Fidel Castro is a job for the Cuban people themselves, not for the U.S. Government or Miami exiles. This cold-war orphan can still annoy the U.S. but poses no serious threat. Instead of gearing up for another round of sterile confrontation, Washington should be spelling out what Cuba could gain, under this regime or a successor, by embracing democracy and respecting human rights. That, rather than increased hunger and misery, might actually encourage those Cubans who remain in Cuba to work for political change.

HEADLINE: In America;
Chavis's Noisy 15 Minutes

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

DATELINE: BALTIMORE

 BODY:
There were a few hundred people in the auditorium of Paul Laurence Dunbar High School on Monday night, but for all practical purposes Ben Chavis was alone. Clinging desperately to the final seconds of his 15 minutes in the spotlight, Mr. Chavis has chosen, in his typically clumsy and contentious way, not to go quietly.
Just an hour or two earlier his lawyers had gone to court to try to block Mr. Chavis's ouster as executive director of the N.A.A.C.P. Now he was onstage, attempting to salvage whatever ego gratification he could from his so-called "crucifixion." 
Outside, just blocks away, neighborhoods were suffering. But Mr. Chavis, for all his rhetoric about helping the poor and the young, is dedicated to the pursuit of his own childishly defiant agenda. And so he offered a couple of special, in-your-face greetings Monday night.
"To all the brothers and sisters who are in America's prisons," said Mr. Chavis, "we send greetings to you."
That, of course, generated big applause, which is the narcotic that satisfies the raging addiction of so many public figures, black and white. There were a lot of brothers and sisters right around the corner from Dunbar High who could have been helped by a competent director of the N.A.A.C.P., but that's too complex and unrewarding an effort to contemplate. Mr. Chavis chose to acknowledge those in prison.
Mr. Chavis's other greeting was for his good friend Louis Farrakhan, who missed Monday's gathering because he wasn't feeling well. "He's our brother!" cried Mr. Chavis to wild cheers. "He's our brother! He's our brother! He's our brother! He's our brother! He's our brother!
The shouts carried out into the streets and echoed into the night.
East Baltimore, where Monday's rally was held, is a neighborhood in danger of sinking into despair. Many adults, their eyes red-glazed and their legs wobbly from alcohol or drugs, will tell you there is nothing that can be done about the collapse of any semblance of civilized behavior by many of the neighborhood's young residents.
"They won't listen to nobody," said Heywood Callendar, an unemployed auto mechanic who lives in a housing project on Gough Street. "Do I drink? Yes, sir. You would too, if you lived around here."
Those adults who still harbor some hope say two things are essential. Parents, especially fathers, must take real responsibility for teaching and raising their kids. Without that, nothing good can happen. The second issue is jobs. No jobs, zero hope.
"For the older ones it's too late," said police officer Edgar Allen, who drove his patrol car slowly through the neighborhood. "For the younger ones, you have to get the parents more involved, and they have to discipline the kids, really discipline them. Right now you have parents who aren't involved at all. The community can only do so much."
Parental involvement and jobs. It should be repeated like a mantra in every neighborhood from Baltimore to Los Angeles and beyond. Ben Chavis never looked more alone on Monday than when a man sitting beside him on the stage complained loudly that American corporations were exporting jobs to Mexico and other third-world countries. That, too, was greeted with loud cheers. There didn't seem to be many who realized that Mr. Chavis had secretly lobbied against their interests and on behalf of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which the N.A.A.C.P. officially opposed.
Civil rights groups are supposed to be the antidote to despair. The purpose of civil rights leaders is to focus on desperate problems and show what can and must be done. The great civil rights leaders of the past were politically skillful men and women blessed with the rare qualities of intelligence, maturity, strength and moral vision.
Ben Chavis is a graduate of the school of pseudo-leadership that mistakes civility and thoughtfulness for weakness, and bombastic rhetoric for strength. The East Baltimores of America are ill served by this approach, which succeeds only in raising false hopes.
When I think of the old-line civil rights leaders, I hear the greatness of the music of Ellington. Ben Chavis and his noisy allies are perfectly suited to the loud and empty era of rap.

HEADLINE: New York City's Pot of Gold

 BODY:
New York may be on the verge of acquiring an unexpected windfall -- millions of dollars in private money to be dipped into for the public good. A new investment fund sponsored by the New York City Partnership is seeking to raise $100 million from wealthy individual and corporate donors; $15 million has already been pledged on the basis of a mere 15 telephone calls. The Partnership's fund-raising is based on a powerful and proven idea: spread development money in the right places at the right moments and the whole city will profit.
Formed in 1978, just as New York was emerging from its last great fiscal crisis, the Partnership includes executives from more than 150 of the city's largest companies. Among them is the Wall Street financier Henry R. Kravis, who proposed the new fund after researching similar economic-development efforts by corporate leaders in cities like Atlanta and Minneapolis. Mr. Kravis has been named chairman. 
 His idea is smart and simple. Corporations and wealthy individuals will be asked to contribute $1 million each to the fund, which is to be operated with no intent to turn a profit. At the end of 15 years the donor could get the money back, along with enough to account for inflation. The fund would issue short-term loans or guarantees to help with projects ranging from neighborhood improvement around Yankee Stadium -- thus, perhaps, insuring that the team will stay put -- to a new restaurant in Central Park to new transportation facilities in Queens.
The project is heartening on several levels. It is clearly a vote of confidence in the city by some of its most powerful corporate chieftains. It also reflects shrewd self-interest: the health of the fund's sponsors and donors is inevitably linked to the city's well-being. Finally, private money may well be able to speed up projects that too often bog down in bureaucratic red tape.
New York is now and always has been a city of great opportunity surrounded by formidable obstacles. It has also been the source of considerable riches for many. Today, as ever, it is heartening to see some of that gold coming back.

HEADLINE: Population Conference Isn't About Abortion;
A Planet Threatened

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Population Enrichment vs. Population Control," a full-page ad Aug. 15, misrepresents and misstates important aspects of the draft program of action to be considered at the International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo. 
 Nowhere in the document does the term population "control" appear. The position of the United States and of the entire community of nations that will be at the conference is to improve human freedom by supporting access to high-quality, fully voluntary family planning services.
The United States recognizes that abortion is widely used in all countries and that where it is unsafe it represents a serious threat to the health of women. The United States position is that abortion should be safe, legal and rare, and recognizes that other sovereign nations make their own laws regarding this isssue. The United States Government has never supported abortion as a method of family planning.
Both the draft program of action and the United States strongly support strengthening family life, while reocognizing that a variety of strong and functional family structures are found throughout the world.
The draft document recognizes that the increase in consumption per person, especially in industrialized countries, and population growth of about a billion every decade, are degrading the planet's life-supporting ecosystems. Lower population growth rates are consistent with the desire for smaller families in developing countries. Slower growth will also promote economic progress and help preserve natural resources.
United States support of population policies and programs is conditional on voluntarism and respect for indigenous cultural values.
Far from de-emphasizing "population enrichment," almost 99 percent of development assistance from donor countries goes for economic development activities in areas such as health and agriculture. A modest shift of resources into the neglected area of population would result in a more balanced development strategy.

HEADLINE: Downsizing's Casualties

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Albert J. Dunlap is a symbol of capitalism's contradiction. At Scott Paper Company, he has been brought in to fire 30 percent of the employees (Business Day, Aug. 15). In the bargain, he has made a tidy profit. 
 Another scalp on his belt, he will move on to downsize the next company. Left behind is the devastation inflicted: financial, social and family dislocation suffered by those who have lost livelihoods. Wall Street is pleased and bids up the stock.
Capitalism needs a reasonably prosperous middle class. As hardworking workers lose their jobs, they devolve to the middle-class fringes. A market economy's excesses become more apparent to a growing number of citizens. This miserable scenario, repeated frequently today, is irrefutable evidence that capitalism's triumph is as overstated as the death of socialism.

HEADLINE: Mexico's Perilous Second Act

BYLINE: By Dick J. Reavis; Dick J. Reavis is author of "Conversations With Moctezuma: Ancient Shadows Over Modern Life in Mexico."

DATELINE: MONTERREY, Mexico

 BODY:
During the terms of Mexico's last two presidents, the purchasing power of consumers has declined by 60 percent, unemployment has doubled, emigration to the United States has not abated and nearly a quarter of the work force has taken to moonlighting -- or to hawking cheap wares on the streets -- in a struggle to survive.
On Sunday, three major presidential candidates stood before the electorate. Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of the leftist Democratic Revolutionary Party promised economic justice for the peasants. Diego Fernandez de Cevallos of the National Action Party, a right-of-center group, promised to throw out the crooks who have been running the country. In contrast, Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, which has monopolized the presidency since 1929, promised only more of the same. 
 Yet partial tallies give Mr. Zedillo almost 50 percent of the total, with Mr. Fernandez around 30 percent and Mr. Cardenas about 16 percent. If democracy means that voters seek self-interest, what happened? Jorge Castaneda, a political scientist and a leading critic of the PRI, says he's not quite sure. "There was a lot of the traditional, retail vote peddling," he told me. "But I think that the results reflect the will of the people."
Most watchdog organizations are indicating that the election was probably the cleanest ever in Mexico. But Eduardo Arguijo Baldenegro, a 38-year-old engineer, isn't buying that. He was the mayoral candidate of the Democratic Revolutionary Party in Villa de Garcia, a small town of adobe walls and pecan orchards in the state of Nuevo Leon.
The most striking exhibit for Mr. Arguijo's case is a pair of brown leather work shoes, shiny new, wrapped in a plastic bag emblazoned with the emblem of the PRI. The manufacturer's marking on the thick soles have been buffed away so that their origin can't be traced. "These shoes were given to people in this district so that they'd vote for the PRI," insisted Mr. Arguijo, who narrowly lost the mayoral contest in 1991 to the PRI candidate.
On Sunday, nearly 90 percent of the town's eligible voters showed up at the polls. Shortly before midnight, local election officials told Mr. Arguijo that he had lost by about 250 votes. On Monday, he had his followers demonstrate outside the town's Office of Electoral Affairs. That night they were rewarded: the vote was annulled on account of electoral fraud.
Mr. Arguijo's crusade proves that in Mexico, where crooked victories are sometimes bargained away, the electoral curtain may not fall for weeks to come. Still, Mr. Zedillo's ascension to the presidency is assured. And the real loser will be the organized left. That bodes ill for the country.
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas called his supporters to town squares across the nation at noon on Monday, urging them to to contest election results in their hometowns. Fewer than 50,000 supporters answered the call in Mexico City, a mere fifth of the crowd that Mr. Cardenas drew there two weeks ago.
When the meeting ended, Jorge Castaneda, who was present, told me that at least a thousand people were recruited to sessions organized by armed groups that proclaim alliances with the guerrilla leader in Chiapas, Subcommander Marcos. These people have no stake in the peaceful reordering of things. Mr. Zedillo is not the only beneficiary of Mr. Cardenas's faltering strength: Subcommander Marcos is smiling, too.
Mr. Cardenas is a unique figure in Mexican politics: a man with moral authority. Yet his poor showing this year may fatally undermine his standing. To stay relevant, Mr. Cardenas must become Mexico's Martin Luther King Jr. -- he must start a nationwide wave of nonviolent civil disobedience against the the PRI's electoral and political abuses.
If he cannot or will not lead his followers into the streets, the armed radicals on his left will step into the vacuum created by his political demise, as the Black Panthers did when Dr. King was assassinated. A wave of violence and repression will begin. The reputation of Mexico's Government and its opposition will be bloodied.
Only one person, a Mexico City resident named Eduardo Rosas Rosas, was arrested for an electoral crime on Sunday. Mr. Rosas may be more worthy than his fame. According to the authorities, he walked into a polling station, took his ballots and tore them up; destruction of electoral materials is a crime. The Government says Mr. Rosas was drunk. But like the millions of Mexicans who cast their ballots, he may have done all that he could to stop the carnage that lies ahead.

HEADLINE: FLIGHT FROM CUBA: THE OVERVIEW;
CASTRO RULES OUT ANY MOVE TO HALT FLOW OF REFUGEES

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MIAMI, Aug. 24

 BODY:
Challenging President Clinton's decision to send Cuban refugees to Guantanamo naval base as an "absurd response" to the mounting immigration crisis between the United States and Cuba, Fidel Castro said tonight that he would make no effort to halt the flow of people leaving his country.
Speaking on state television, the Cuban President said the United States was to blame for the exodus that began earlier this month and is growing by the day. New policy measures announced by Mr. Clinton in recent days only "make the problem more complicated," Mr. Castro said. 
 "They cannot blame us for that situation," Mr. Castro said. "They created a mentality in a lot of people" in Cuba that "they had the right to travel to the United States illegally."
American efforts to provoke what Mr. Castro described as massive illegal immigration gave Cuba "no alternative" but to loosen its rules on leaving the country and instruct its Coast Guard to allow malcontents to take to the seas. He characterized Cuban policy as eminently humane, and contrasted it with the American decision to send Cuban refugees to Guantanamo, which he called a "concentration camp."
The Cuban leader also portrayed Mr. Clinton as a prisoner of Cuban exile groups here, which he called "a fascist mafia of the extreme right." Mr. Clinton, he said, had been "pressured by ultra-rightists" to take steps intended to destroy the Cuban revolution, only to see his efforts backfire.
Wearing the familiar olive green uniform of the commander in chief of the Cuban military, Mr. Castro spoke for more than 90 minutes, offering his interpretation of hijackings in Cuba and actions by Washington that he said initiated the crisis. His remarks were broadcast live in the United States, in a simultaneous English translation on CNN and in Spanish by the Telemundo network.
The speech was Mr. Castro's first public comment on the crisis since Mr. Clinton announced last Friday that Cuban refugees would no longer be allowed to enter the United States, and followed up a day later with a package of harsh new measures intended to further isolate Cuba. For the most part, Mr. Castro reiterated statements he made in similar appearances on Cuban television earlier this month, indicating that he is not interested in striking a conciliatory tone in an effort to resolve the crisis.
Mr. Castro also referred to a statement last weekend by Leon Panetta, the White House Chief of Staff, that the Clinton Administration is considering a blockade of Cuba. He warned against such an action, saying it would be "an act of war."
As he has done innumerable times in the past, Mr. Castro fixed the blame for most of Cuba's problems on the economic embargo the United States has enforced against his country since the early 1960's. "These measures compel the massive exodus," he said.
Earlier today, two senior Cuban officials also said that Washington was mainly to blame for the exodus, and said Cuba would try to end the flow of refugees only if the United States agreed to broad talks on a full range of bilateral matters.
Speaking at a news conference in New York this morning, Cuba's chief delegate to the United Nations, Fernando Remirez de Estenoz Barciela, said that, though his Government regards the exodus as primarily an American problem, Cuba is willing to discuss ways to halt the flow of refugees that has filled the Straits of Florida for the last two weeks.
But he added that the United States must in turn demonstrate its willingness to address the questions Cuba believes are the "true causes" of the migration, including Washington's three-decade ban on trade with Cuba.
"Migration itself could be one of the topics," Mr. Remirez said. But he said "the issues of lifting the blockade, the Guantanamo naval base" and "subversive radio and TV transmissions against Cuba would have to be part and parcel of a comprehensive negotiation process."
 
Washington Rejects Talks
 American officials had no immediate reaction to Mr. Castro's speech late tonight, but earlier today the Administration promptly rejected the Cuban diplomat's suggestion of bilateral talks, dismissing it as an attempt by Mr. Castro to divert attention from his own internal problems. And the Administration reiterated its resolve to house fleeing Cubans at expanded camps at Guantanamo Bay and elsewhere rather than allow them into the United States.
The Cuban population at Guantanamo, estimated at 2,000 before today, was certain to grow drastically, with 7,000 Cubans on their way there in Coast Guard boats this morning and another 2,791 fetched from the sea by 10 P.M.
Presaging Mr. Castro's remarks this evening, the Cuban Foreign Minister, Roberto Robaina, said at a news conference in Santiago, Chile, today that in the absence of broad negotiations, the Cuban leader is prepared to continue with his current policy of turning a blind eye to the hundreds of rafts and boats that are now leaving Cuba daily.
Under the new rules announced by President Clinton on Saturday, Cuban-Americans would no longer be allowed to visit or send money to relatives in Cuba. In addition, anti-Castro broadcasts to the island will be increased, a step that Mr. Castro bitterly criticized tonight, calling it a provocation.
 
Fancy Chairs or Plain Seats
 Addressing reporters at the end of an official visit to Chile, Mr. Robaina said his Government was prepared to meet with American representatives at any time, at any place and on any level. "We are willing to talk with the United States with one condition, which is that there be no conditions," he said.
But both Mr. Robaina and Mr. Remirez indicated that the Cuban Government is not willing to discuss bringing an end to Mr. Castro's 35 years in power, which the United States argues is the only way to solve Cuba's political and economic crisis. "Any negotiations will have to include accepting us as we are, with full respect for the Cuban people," Mr. Remirez said.
"Cuba does not have to return to democracy, because Cuba is in a democracy," Mr. Robaina argued. "The question of when Fidel decides to go to elections or not is a problem of a personal decision of Fidel.
 
Reject Third-Party Role
 The Cuban diplomats also rejected suggestions that either the United Nations or a third country might act as a broker between the two nations, which have not maintained diplomatic relations in more than 30 years. "Any negotiation ought to be direct," he said.
In dismissing the Cuban offer, American officials called it an attempt by Mr. Castro to win some breathing space from his deepening domestic problems. At a news conference in Washington, the Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, Peter Tarnoff, said the real issue was Mr. Castro's aversion to democracy and his economic policies.
"We see nothing to be gained from the kind of talks" the Cuban diplomats proposed, Mr. Tarnoff said. "It should be clear after 35 years to Fidel Castro and his Government that the way he is managing the affairs of the island is a failure."
By arguing that the real cause of the immigration crisis is the American economic embargo, Mr. Castro was repeating a long-standing Cuban position. In a speech delivered just as the refugee exodus was beginning earlier this month, he argued that Cuba could no longer afford to be "the guardian of the North Americans' coasts" if Washington continued to strangle the faltering Cuban economy.
When President Clinton took office 19 months ago, Mr. Castro made overtures, hoping to capitalize on the change in Washington. But in recent months he has expressed exasperation at the Administration's willingness to deal with other old enemies while continuing to ignore Cuba.
"The United States talks with Vietnam and looks for solutions to the problems of Vietnam, and even talks with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea," Mr. Castro said, referring to North Korea, in a speech earlier this month. "But it will not talk with Cuba."
In fact, since Mr. Clinton took office, there have been some low-level contacts between the United States and Cuba on technical issues, including immigration. But Mr. Castro has made it clear that he expected more progress with the Democrats in power and was growing impatient with that slow pace.

HEADLINE: New Wrinkle in Korea Issue: Who Is in Charge in North?

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Aug. 24

 BODY:
The North Korean nuclear issue, already fraught with dangerous uncertainties, is now punctuated by another troubling question mark: who is in charge in North Korea?
In recent days there has been a string of reports, some from North Korea, some amplified by the South Korean Government for its own purposes, hinting at strife over choosing a successor to Kim Il Sung, the Communist dictator who ruled North Korea for more than four decades until his death nearly two months ago. 
 Despite much talk in the North Korean news media since then of the importance of a smooth succession and the virtues of Mr. Kim's chosen heir, his son, Kim Jong Il, North Korea still has no head of state, and the Workers' Party, which dominates all aspects of life, has no secretary general. Kim Jong Il, 52, holds the important position of head of the military, but he has been out of sight now for a month.
The younger Mr. Kim has always been a mysterious and reclusive man, and there have been some reports that he is simply sitting out a period of mourning for his father before assuming titles that would only acknowledge the power he already holds. Intelligence officials in both South Korea and the United States say that they have no evidence he is having trouble taking over those top leadership positions, but the latest reports have added to the suspicions about the country that is perhaps the most closed society on earth.
One report out of South Korea maintains that leaflets criticizing Kim Jong Il were distributed in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, while another recirculates rumors that have been unproved for years, that the younger Mr. Kim is suffering serious health problems. Even South Korean intelligence officials acknowledge that, while they have suspicions, they do not know what is happening in Pyongyang and who is really in power since the death of the man the North called the Great Leader.
Most important, this vacuum has come when Pyongyang is engaged in the most far-reaching and risky negotiations with the outside in decades -- talks with the United States that could lead to the abandonment of North Korea's nuclear ambitions as the country's first steps toward integration with world economics.
The prospect of such an opening -- and the possibility that a breakdown could lead to a military confrontation -- has made the uncertainties surrounding North Korea's leadership even more troubling.
The recent wave of concern began over the weekend when North Korean radio broadcast a report that sounded like a warning to those who might resist the succession of Kim Jong Il.
The radio report, monitored here, said, "A historical lesson is that if we fail to resolve forthwith the issue of the successor who would take over the revolutionary tasks initiated by the Great Leader, the party and revolution would be made a mockery of by the traitorous acts of ambitious people and conspirators."
That followed a hostile blast that came out on Saturday, in which a Foreign Ministry official was quoted as insisting that North Korea would never agree to a critical point being demanded by Washington in the nuclear talks, that Pyongyang permit international inspections of two nuclear waste sites that, it is believed, hold evidence of how much bomb-making material the North may have already produced.
A wide ranging framework for an agreement was announced in Geneva on Aug. 12, and in it North Korea agreed in vague terms to opening its nuclear program to the inspections. So the latest report appeared to mark a hardening of Pyongyang's position after a brief period of flexibility.
After the announcement on Saturday came reports in South Korea that leaflets saying "Down with Kim Jong Il" were found in the diplomatic quarter of Pyongyang. Two western diplomats in Pyongyang, interviewed by telephone, said they had neither seen nor heard of such leaflets, and said such an open show of defiance was doubtful. In addition, a Pyongyang-based correspondent for Tass, the Russian news agency, reported that no leaflets were found.
[A German diplomat in Seoul said that the German Foreign Ministry in Pyongyang confirmed the existence of the leaflets but had not actually seen them, Reuters reported.]
 Nevertheless, the South Korean Government seized on the reports, hinted it believed them, and appeared to go out of its way to convey publicly a sense of worry and drama.
 
Address to Citizens
 Kim Young Sam, the South Korean President, was widely quoted as telling a group of members of the ruling party in Seoul: "Every citizen should stay alert and cautious enough to cope with any contingency in light of a number of serious moves being observed in North Korea." Government officials admitted that this admonition did not entail any unusual steps by the Government.
Mr. Park added that, ultimately, this raised the issue of whether the negotiations on the nuclear issue, which are scheduled to reconvene in Geneva next month, can produce an agreement that will be carried out.
"That is exactly the point the United States and South Korea should look into carefully, whether we are dealing with the right people or not," said Mr. Park. "It's a guessing game."
 
Grist for Stories
 An American official who has followed the situation commented on the rumblings about succession problems in the North: "We're treating it as a rumor. But it's still too early to say that it's not true. We don't know."
The official North Korean news media, as usual, have been providing plenty of grist for stories that the succession is proceeding smoothly. The Workers' Party newspaper today carried an article, quoted by the official Korean Central News Agency, saying, "The Dear Leader, Kim Jong Il, who has fully inherited all the noble virtues and qualities of the fatherly leader, is the great leader who is leading the Korean people to victory."
The article also characterized Mr. Kim as the head of the party and of the state, the two titles he is still formally missing.
 
Demands by the North
 "To all these questions, my answer is this: let's wait and see," said Kim Sam Hoon, South Korea's chief official on nuclear issues.
If anything, these developments only underscored how much is at stake in this sensitive phase in one of the world's most dangerous regions. For example, North Korea has said that, in principle, it would be willing to scale back its nuclear program if it received modern light-water reactors for generating electricity, economic aid and diplomatic recognition. Any agreement along those lines would entail not a moderate turn in North Korea's policy, but a radical shift in course.
The construction of a new nuclear reactor by outsiders, which would also require the revamping of the country's outdated electrical grid, diplomatic engagement with the United States and an opening to investment, would represent a burst of light into the shadowy world of North Korea. That would bring enormous social and political risks to both North and South Korea, since no one knows how such a rigidly controlled society would respond to these contacts.

HEADLINE: FLIGHT FROM CUBA: GOVERNMENT POLICY;
Hardening Its Stance, U.S. Expands Guantanamo Camp

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 24

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration today ordered a vast and immediate expansion of its capacity to house fleeing Cubans at Guantanamo Bay and said it was prepared to maintain encampments of Cubans at the base or perhaps in third countries for the indefinite future.
Faced with an ever-surging flow of refugees, the Administration made clear that it intended to expend enormous effort to accommodate the Cubans in tent cities abroad without allowing them to spill onto American shores. 
 "They will absolutely, in no way, have any way of coming to the United States," said Dee Dee Myers, the White House spokeswoman.
By painting the prospect of a bleak life in rough camps, the White House sought to convince Cubans somehow that setting out to sea will no longer get them to the United States. But at the same time, Mr. Clinton's deputies showed clear concern over the mounting financial and political costs of an exodus that has confounded the Administration and begun to stretch Government resources thin.
 
Policy a Failure, Dole Says
 As Senator Bob Dole, the Republican leader, labeled Mr. Clinton's policy a failure, Defense Secretary William J. Perry conceded that days of broadcast warnings and other messages by the Administration had failed to convince Cubans that they would fare better at home.
"We have a flood of boat people on the way to Guantanamo now," Mr. Perry told reporters at a special White House briefing.
To underscore Mr. Clinton's determination to insulate Americans from the impact of the exodus, Ms. Myers declared today that the President would never move Cubans intercepted at sea to military bases, to Federal facilities on the United States mainland or, in fact, to the nation at all.
But no one in the Administration could offer a clear picture today of how the United States hopes to create conditions that might entice Cubans who have fled Fidel Castro's regime to return home. And as aides to Mr. Clinton acknowledged that establishing havens for them would require enormous expense and manpower, they said the relentless arithmetic of the refugee crisis might yet leave the White House little choice but to return fleeing Cubans to their country, a last-ditch move they would seek at all costs to avoid.
With the hasty drive to erect more tents and cots, the capacity of refugee camps in the 45-square-mile base in Guantanamo Bay will nearly double to 40,000 by the end of the next week, Mr. Perry announced. Under a directive issued by the Pentagon today, it could grow to 60,000 or beyond; at the same time, the Administration moved toward agreements with Panama and other countries that could provide the option of transferring refugees to havens there.
Since the abrupt reversal in the United States' open-door policy for Cuban refugees last Friday, more than 2,000 Cubans have been shipped to Guantanamo after being intercepted in the Straits of Florida. They have joined 14,000 Haitians who have been there for weeks, and 7,000 more Cubans were being carried there this morning aboard Coast Guard and Naval vessels.
Even after 10 P.M. today, however, by which time the United States had already plucked 2,791 more Cubans from the sea and set them on a course toward Guantanamo, senior aides to Mr. Clinton said they believed the rapid expansion of the base could keep pace for now with an alarming refugee tide.
From Attorney General Janet Reno, who sought to project toughness as she glared into television cameras at the White House, to Administration officials who met with Cuban-Americans in Florida, aides to Mr. Clinton sought every opportunity today to try to find some new way to persuade Cubans to stay home.
"It is too dangerous," Ms. Reno, a former Dade County prosecutor, said in a message intended to be relayed to Cubans in expanded Spanish-language broadcasts by Radio Marti. "You are going to Guantanamo or to other safe havens and you will not be processed -- not be processed -- for admission to the United States."
At the same briefing, Mr. Perry appeared intent on quashing suspicions that the Administration's will to provide for vast numbers of Cubans on its leased territory in Guantanamo might expire. "We are preparing to maintain that base indefinitely, if necessary, until such time as the people can be repatriated to Cuba," the Defense Secretary said.
Fernando Remirez de Estenoz Barciela, the Cuban representative to the United Nations, said in New York today that the refugee crisis could end if the United States opened talks with the Castro Government as a step toward lifting its economic embargo against Havana. Under Secretary of State Peter Tarnoff quickly responded that the United States saw "nothing to be gained" from such a course.
"It should be clear after 35 years to Fidel Castro and his government that the way he has been managing the affairs of the island is a failure," Mr. Tarnoff said. But that stance came under immediate criticism from some Democrats on Capitol Hill, who said that an Administration that has proven willing to open high-level talks with North Korea and grant preferential trade status to China should open a dialogue with Mr. Castro.
"The cold war is over," Senator Christopher J. Dodd, the Connecticut Democrat and chairman of the Senate subcommittee on Western Hemisphere affairs, said from the Senate floor. "Cuba no longer presents the type of threat that it did even a few months ago."
The sense of alarm within the Administration about the refugee flow could nevertheless be measured in the sheer numbers of Coast Guard vessels and Navy ships assigned to the effort. At least 30 Coast Guard cutters, some from the West Coast, along with a similar number of smaller Coast Guard craft, were patrolling the waters off Florida tonight, where they were joined by 10 Navy ships and awaited the arrival Thursday of three more Navy vessels.
 
Threat of Opening New Door
 Administration officials expressed apprehension that the Castro Government, which they believe has deliberately loosed the refugee flow, might make another destabilizing move. At the White House today, Mr. Tarnoff, the third-ranking official at the State Department, warned that the United States would regard as "an unfriendly act" a decision by the Cuban Government to permit Cubans to enter the Guantanamo Bay base over land, a step that could quickly overflow tents and cots now in place in the compound.
Even if it can be maintained, Administration officials acknowledged today, the decision to house Cuban migrants in the Guantanamo base or third countries carries heavy costs in energy and expense. They noted that the cost of intercepting and housing Haitian refugees since the spring has already soared over $200 million.
Even if the Cubans were moved to a haven in Panama or another country, those costs would continue to mount, Administration officials said today. They said the Pentagon had concluded that 800 American troops would be needed at a proposed camp in the British-owned Turks and Caicos to watch over just 2,500 refugees there.
For that reason, the officials said, the Administration is unlikely to move swiftly to transfer Cubans or Haitians to third countries even if it can reach agreements with them to provide havens.


GRAPHIC: Existing refugee camps and those under construction will be able to hold at least 60,000 refugees. As of yesterday morning, about 17,000 refugees were housed at the base.

HEADLINE: All Haitians Are Tuned In to the Rumor Mill

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, Aug. 18

 BODY:
The story spread like wildfire: a secret underground pipeline had been built under the border and was pumping gasoline from the Dominican Republic into Haiti, defying international sanctions. That fanciful tale going around this month was then succeeded by reports of dozens of clandestine laboratories being built in the countryside to make poison for use against American invaders.
Millions of Haiti's people live beyond the reach of newspapers, television and even radio, but everyone here, from illiterate peasants to the rich, has a lifetime subscription to the flourishing word-of-mouth network known as "telediol," or "mouth television." Part rumor mill, part oral news service, telediol is one of the most accessible and effective means of communication for Haitians. 
 The importance of the medium was demonstrated again last month when the number of people leaving by boat for the United States suddenly surged, threatening to wreck the Clinton Administration's policy on Haitian refugees, and then just as quickly dropped to a trickle. In both instances, Haitians and foreign diplomats say, people were responding to information obtained via telediol.
 
Word Spreads Fast
 Initially, boat people picked up by the Coast Guard were allowed into the United States, and sent word back to their villages that chances of success were high. But when Washington switched to a policy of sending refugees to the American naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, or to "safe havens" in other countries, people in even the most remote areas learned of that change within a few days.
"What Washington had to say throughout that exodus was far less important than the message transmitted by Haitians who had made it to Miami or had ended up in Guantanamo," a diplomat here said. "Thanks to telediol, that word got up into the hills and out into the hinterland with a speed and a degree of accuracy that was astonishing."
Even when information passed along the network turns out not to be true, it can influence events. This spring, for instance, after news spread that a foreign tanker loaded with fuel would soon dock in the port of Jacmel, the price of gasoline dropped sharply, rising again only after the United States Embassy said no such vessel existed.
Sometimes known as "Radio 32," a reference to the number of teeth in the mouth, telediol is also of vital importance to supporters of Haiti's ousted President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide. Denied access to most other media, which are increasingly controlled or censored by the military-dominated Government, they have been forced to rely on word-of-mouth to make their case.
Telediol has always been an important means of transmitting information in a country in which an estimated 65 to 80 percent of the people are illiterate and the principal language, Creole, did not develop a full written form until a generation ago. But the importance of oral communication has been sharpened by the current political crisis, in particular the economic embargo imposed on Haiti by the United Nations with the intention of forcing Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras, the military leader, and his associates to step down.
Even before the embargo, there were just two newspapers of any note in the capital, each publishing only three times a week, and a mere five televisions for every 1,000 Haitians. But because of the extensive gasoline shortages brought on by the sanctions, electricity is available in most areas less than a quarter of the day, making television reception impossible except for the very few wealthy enough to afford their own gas-powered generators.
Radio, traditionally the most popular mass medium, has been just as severely affected. Poor people living in areas with no electrical service -- about two-thirds of Haiti's population of seven million -- are big users of transistor radios, but the batteries to power them are no longer available.
"If I can't afford to feed my children, then I certainly can't afford to buy radio batteries on the black market," said Jean-Leonel Antoine, an unemployed carpenter who lives on the outskirts of the capital in the sprawling slum called Cite Soleil. "So I rely on word of mouth to know what's going on."
In addition, the state of siege that the "provisional President," Emile Jonassaint, decreed on Aug. 1 includes measures intended to prevent radio and television from presenting balanced coverage, warning stations to "avoid the diffusion of all alarmist or tendentious news" and not to allow themselves to become "instruments of foreign propaganda."
Another order forbids stations from broadcasting any "communique from foreign embassies or press services" and threatens "appropriate measures to enforce these restrictions" if there are violations.
Other unpopular Haitian rulers have tried to stamp out telediol, without success. The dictator Francois Duvalier, for one, made rumormongering a crime, but telediol went underground, and was often quite accurate in predicting what he would do. Though telediol may not always be accurate, it is always fast. One old Haitian joke tells of a man whose boss tells him he has lost his job and who then heads straight home, only to have his wife greet him by saying, "I heard -- you've been fired."

HEADLINE: THE HEALTH CARE DEBATE: THE HOUSE;
House Democrats Far Short of Votes for Health Care Plan, Tallies Find

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 24

 BODY:
Confidential vote counts by the most ardent supporters of universal health insurance show that House Democrats are far short of the votes needed to pass sweeping health care legislation.
The counts are hardly a surprise. Democratic leaders in the House have not begun to whip their partisans into line, and they have conceded for weeks that they cannot pass the legislation they want today. The Senate is even less eager to embrace widespread changes in the health care system. 
 The House is considering a bill proposed by the Democratic floor leader, Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, that would require employers to pay 80 percent of their workers' health insurance premiums.
 
Such Surveys Feared
 The vote counts show so many Democrats opposing the Gephardt bill that White House officials recently urged their allies outside Government not to compile or distribute such lists for fear they could be used to undercut people lobbying for an employer mandate. A lobbyist who heard the White House appeal summarized the concern this way: "Members of Congress are already nervous about voting for an employer mandate. If they saw these numbers, they'd be less willing to walk the plank."
The tallies, the most systematic effort to tabulate sentiment in Congress to date, were compiled by a coalition of more than 75 labor, business, health, consumer, civil rights and disability groups. The coalition supports universal insurance coverage with a requirement for employers to help pay for it. Lobbyists from the organizations meet daily to share political intelligence, discuss strategy and parcel out lobbying assignments.
 
60 Firmly Opposed
 The lists classify House members in five categories, according to their positions on the Gephardt bill. The latest list, circulated this week, shows more than 60 Democrats firmly opposed to the Gephardt bill or likely to vote against it. The tally names 153 Democrats as supporters of the Gephardt bill and 22 leaning in favor, with 15 undecided or neutral. This leaves the Democrats well short of the 218 votes needed to pass a bill if all 435 House members vote. Democratic leaders have not been counting on any House Republicans to back the Gephardt bill.
In the Senate, similar tallies suggest that 51 of the 100 senators are, at the moment, likely to vote against a proposal to make employers contribute to the cost of health insurance for their employees. The Senate Democratic leader, George J. Mitchell of Maine, wants to impose such a requirement on companies with 25 or more employees if voluntary efforts do not achieve insurance coverage for 95 percent of Americans by the year 2000.
Laura Nichols, a spokeswoman for Mr. Gephardt, said, "We have not taken an official whip count, a formal up or down count" of House members. She said some lawmakers were waiting for cost estimates from the Congressional Budget Office before they decided how to vote.
Ned McCulloch, a lobbyist at the Service Employees International Union, said the coalition's vote counts were based on statements by members of Congress to lobbyists in Washington and to constituents back home. Spot checks by The New York Times confirmed the accuracy of the assessments.
 
Opposition From South
 The latest list shows that much of the Democratic opposition to Mr. Gephardt's bill comes, as expected, from the South and the Southwest. Among those listed as likely to vote against it are Representatives Michael A. Andrews of Texas, Jim Cooper of Tennessee, Mike Parker of Mississippi, J. Roy Rowland of Georgia, Charles W. Stenholm of Texas and W. J. (Billy) Tauzin of Louisiana.
But the list also suggests opposition among House Democrats in other parts of the country. For example, Representatives Robert E. Andrews of New Jersey, Cal Dooley and Jane Harman of California, Lee H. Hamilton of Indiana, Richard H. Lehman of California, Paul McHale of Pennsylvania, Collin C. Peterson of Minnesota and Earl Pomeroy of North Dakota are listed as likely to vote against the Gephardt bill.
Robert A. Chlopak, a coordinator of the coalition supporting the Gephardt bill, said the situation was in flux. "There's a strong base of support for Gephardt," he said. "We have work to do to get the votes to go over the top, but it's within reach."
 
Employer Burden Feared
 In an interview, Representative Pomeroy, who served as Insurance Commissioner of North Dakota for eight years, said he objected to the Gephardt bill because it would impose a new burden on employers and create "a substantially larger role for Government," expanding Medicare to cover millions of people who are uninsured or work for small businesses. "Private insurance would not be able to compete with the new Part C of Medicare," he said.
In two other tests of party loyalty, Mr. Pomeroy voted for President Clinton's budget plan last year and for the anti-crime bill this month. But he said today: "If one listens closely, one can hear the air going out of the balloon for the Gephardt proposal." Passage of an omnibus health bill like the Gephardt bill is simply not going to happen in the final weeks of this session. The leadership is losing a whole tier of moderate Democrats that they would need to pass it."
Mr. Hamilton, a member of Congress for 30 years, has not said publicly how he will vote on the Gephardt bill. But in a recent report to constituents, he wrote:
"Hoosiers are becoming more cautious as they learn more about health care reform. I think Congress and the President should proceed with reforms which have strong public support, such as insurance reform, reducing red tape and promoting managed care. What we should not do is try to reform the entire health care system in one year."
 
'Social Engineering'
 Congressman Andrews of New Jersey, explaining his opposition to the Gephardt bill, said: "We don't want a plan that disrupts the coverage or raises the taxes of people who have coverage. People see it as social engineering with 15 percent of the economy."
The Senate tally shows how lawmakers are expected to vote on a motion to eliminate the employer mandate from Mr. Mitchell's bill. Eight Democrats and all but one of the Senate's 44 Republicans are listed as likely to support such a motion.
The tally of Democrats shows Senators David L. Boren of Oklahoma, Sam Nunn of Georgia and Richard C. Shelby of Alabama as firmly opposed to an employer mandate. Listed as leaning against the mandate are Senators John B. Breaux of Louisiana, Ernest F. Hollings of South Carolina, J. Bennett Johnston of Louisiana, Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut.

YESTERDAY
The bipartisan coalition of senators that has offered an alternative proposal held the spotlight, as President Clinton criticized the plan while the group was working to complete it and a variety of lobbyists attacked it.
 
CONGRESS
The self-styled "mainstream coalition," led by Senator John H. Chafee, Republican of Rhode Island, argued that its plan would broaden the number of insured Americans to about 92 percent of the population from about 85 percent. Members also said their plan would slow the flow of Federal red ink by about $100 billion over 10 years.
 
WHITE HOUSE
 President Clinton criticized the coalition's proposal for not requiring employers to pay for their workers' insurance. He said this meant there could not be prescription drug coverage for the elderly or much money for long-term care. Mr. Clinton said the group was "walking away from what is the only known way to provide universal coverage, control cost increases in the out years, and still generate enough money."
 
LOBBYING
Organizations representing businesses, the elderly, unions and the disabled attacked the plan. The United States Chamber of Commerce called it "unacceptable," complaining of new taxes on employers who do offer insurance to workers. The National Association of Manufacturers said it would lead to excessive litigation. At the same time, a group of nearly 100 labor, medical and civic organizations denounced the proposal, for, among other things, lacking "any requirement for employer contributions." Those critics included the American Academy of Family Physicians, the League of Women Voters and the United Steelworkers of America. Eugene Lehrmann, president of the American Association of Retired Persons, said: "We oppose it. It doesn't get health care reform right."

HEADLINE: Stopping Blight at the Border;
Two Paths for Ridgewood, Queens, and Bushwick, Brooklyn

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

 BODY:
For the residents of Ridgewood, Queens, the invisible jagged line separating them from Bushwick, Brooklyn, has long been an object of both anxiety and opportunity.
A small but sturdy community on the southwest edge of Queens, across the street from Brooklyn, Ridgewood watched in fear as Bushwick set itself aflame in the 1960's and 70's, culminating in the July 1977 blackout that produced a night of smoke and looting. "Ridgewood has only five years left to go" was the popular phrase 25, 20 and 15 years ago among doomsaying residents, convinced that Bushwick's blight would spread. 
 But Bushwick's example proved an incentive for Ridgewood to prevent an onslaught of flight, decay and urban fatalism. A group of civic and business associations coalesced around the idea that a neighborhood could remain stable while becoming ethnically diverse.
Now, 17 years after the blackout, which many thought would set the stage for Ridgewood's destruction, the neighborhood has emerged as one of the few stable, diverse blue-collar areas left in New York. Much of Ridgewood's success comes from an ability to hang on to its own manufacturing industry, providing jobs and a tax base. Economists and planners say this mixture of self-determination and good fortune is what New York City needs in its less sure-footed neighborhoods.
 
Business Groups and Vigilance
 "Ridgewood has become a model for what needs to be done in other areas of New York," said Mitchell L. Moss, director of the Urban Research Center at New York University's graduate school. "It's one of the most important blue-collar ethnic communities we have left."
The neighborhood has successfully used many tools from the city and state, including a business improvement district that taxes merchants along Myrtle Avenue to keep the main commercial strip clean and vigorous, a local development corporation that fosters industry, and a restoration corporation that helps keep its brownstones from falling into disrepair and being abandoned.
But residents attribute much of their success to simple vigilance: a never-ending campaign to wash off graffiti, fill an empty store, keep a knitting mill from moving or a landlord from letting his apartment house decay. Bushwick stands nearby as a constant reminder of what could happen when a neighborhood lets its guard down.
 
Success Without Quiche
 "It's always an uphill battle," said Paul Kerzner, chairman of the Greater Ridgewood Restoration Corporation, which plants street trees and works with landlords to preserve housing. "When you see graffiti, you have to clean it up right away. When you hear of a drug location, you have to scream bloody murder to the police captain until you get results. Little by little, you create a climate of civility that people respect, and you make sure that standard never gets lowered."
In the early 1980's, after the civil unrest but before the crack epidemic that ravaged much of Bushwick, Mr. Kerzner and other residents dreamed of creating another Park Slope or Brooklyn Heights. "In a very short time, we'll be a household name," Mr. Kerzner said in a newspaper interview in 1983, just after 3,000 Ridgewood homes were listed in the National Register of Historic Places. "We're going to get the quiche crowd."
But neither the quiche nor the crowd ever showed up. Ridgewood remains working-class, with a Mandee store instead of a Gap. Parents shop at large children's stores like Happy Days, where inexpensive strollers hang from the ceiling. Mothers who work in the knitting mills on Ridgewood's southern tier walk home with their children after school.
Though its German bakeries and restaurants still do a brisk business -- a lingering remnant of the neighborhood's European heritage -- a growing number of Hispanic and Asian merchants have opened shop on Myrtle and on Fresh Pond Road. Their presence reflects the neighborhood's population, which is now one-quarter Hispanic, one-tenth Asian and the rest mostly white.
Though the border with Brooklyn is unmarked -- and known primarily to longtime residents, mail carriers and politicians -- anyone driving through the two neighborhoods would have no trouble distinguishing them.
 
Two Myrtle Avenues
 In Ridgewood, Myrtle Avenue is swept by a private sanitation crew hired by the local business improvement district. The Ridgewood part of Myrtle is not only far cleaner than the part that runs through Bushwick, which is kept in permanent shadow by an overhead subway track, but is also cleaner than that in adjoining Glendale, a much more homogenous neighborhood farther east in Queens.
Though Bushwick has built some attractive public housing in recent years, many private homes, owned by outside landlords, are in poor repair or boarded up. By contrast, most of Ridgewood's housing is made up of well-kept brownstones and small apartment buildings, most of them occupied by their owners.
Ridgewood has its own manufacturing base in the abundance of knitting mills that make it the country's knitting capital. Most of the mill workers are neighborhood women of Hispanic or European heritage, who often provide a second income for their families. While Bushwick's industrial base crumbled decades ago when the big national breweries forced local beer manufacturers out of business, the knitting mill owners have survived despite growing pressure from foreign competitors.
Ridgewood's interlocking network of civic groups and improvement associations stops abruptly at the Brooklyn border. Ridgewood leaders concede they have done little to assist in Bushwick's halting climb out of the blight that began in the 1970's and the spread of drugs and crime in the 1980's. Instead, they have concentrated on keeping problems out of their neighborhood, and by extension, much of the rest of Queens.
 
Racism, but Diversity
 "You could make a case that Ridgewood is the most important neighborhood in America," said Gary Giordano, a longtime resident and manager of the local community board, only half joking. "Here you've got Queens, which has the largest and most stable middle-class tax base of any borough in the largest city in the country. If working-class residents started to abandon Ridgewood, and were replaced by people who are unemployed or substance abusers, it would have a devastating effect on the adjacent neighborhoods and the rest of Queens."
Mr. Giordano is aware that such words, coming from a white man living near a racial divide, carry the familiar whiff of code phrases for minorities. But he said that while racism is present in Ridgewood, the neighborhood is among the more diverse in Queens. According to 1990 Census figures, Ridgewood is 64 percent white, 26 percent Hispanic and about 9 percent Asian. Though it has few blacks, it is more diverse than Middle Village and Howard Beach, both 91 percent white; Bayside, which is 78 percent white; and St. Albans, which is 95 percent black.
There are still residents in Ridgewood who lower their voice when saying the word "Brooklyn," as if the very name embodied the other-ness of the people who live across the county border, which runs in an irregular line across Cypress, Wyckoff and Irving avenues. Politicians have been known to campaign in Ridgewood on a platform to "keep Brooklyn out of Queens," which is often interpreted as keeping Ridgewood mostly white.
 
Shopping Across Border
 Nonetheless, the neighborhood has tolerated and absorbed a large number of Hispanic residents, many of whom moved across the border from Bushwick, which is 65 percent Hispanic and a quarter black. And some Bushwick residents say they prefer shopping in Ridgewood rather than on their less prosperous commercial strip on Knickerbocker Avenue.
Vincent Hall Jr., a longtime Bushwick community leader, who is black, said he felt far more at ease shopping in Ridgewood than he would in more predominantly white Queens neighborhoods like Howard Beach.
"I don't blame them for working hard to improve themselves," said Mr. Hall. "We don't have any jealousy or conflict between our neighborhoods; in fact, more power to them. Now what we have to do in Bushwick is learn how they did it and see if we can do it ourselves."
Bushwick's decline began with the postwar demise of the breweries and accelerated with the migration out of dense urban areas. Because Queens was seen as newer and more suburban, it attracted many Brooklyn residents seeking escape. Many European immigrants who had lived crowded into neighborhoods like Williamsburg and Greenpoint felt comfortable amid the old-world atmosphere of Ridgewood. Crossing the Brooklyn-Queens line was an important psychological passage for many families, and it remains so today.
 
Keeping the Stoops Clean
 The descendants of those Europeans have no doubt that a certain Germanic fussiness played a large role in Ridgewood's continuing insistence on staying physically fit.
"The most public face of Ridgewood has always been clean," said Joannene Coppinger-Borock, who grew up in the neighborhood and is now industrial coordinator for the Ridgewood Local Development Corporation. "It goes back to those old German ladies keeping their stoops so clean you could eat off them."
The European tradition of guilds and improvement associations made Ridgewood an ideal testing ground for innovations like the business improvement district, under which the state grants local groups taxing authority. Ridgewood's, established in 1988, was the first such district in Queens.
Theodore M. Renz, a lifelong resident who is executive director of the development corporation, said he is concerned that there isn't a next generation of leaders, white or minority, waiting to take over the structures of neighborhood power that have supported Ridgewood in the past.

HEADLINE: FLIGHT FROM CUBA: IN FLORIDA;
Waiting Anxiously For Rules On Cuba

BYLINE: By JON NORDHEIMER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MIAMI, Aug. 24

 BODY:
As the Clinton Administration delayed announcing new rules on trade with Cuba today, small businesses here that depend on sending visitors and goods to Cuba waited anxiously to find out whether the escalating United States crackdown would put them out of business.
New regulations reflecting President Clinton's order restricting money transfers and charter flights to Cuba were supposed to be published today by the Treasury Department's Foreign Assets Control Office. But Administration officials said this evening that the publication of the rules would be delayed. 
 The people who help Miami's Cuban residents send money orders and packages of food, clothing and medicine to relatives in Cuba said they would have to close shop if such shipments are banned.
"We are going to do what the Government will allow us to do," said Carlos Hernandez, manager of Va Cuba, one of about 80 outfits in the Miami area that specialize in shipments to Cuba.
"But no one can control the individual," he cautioned, predicting that many Cubans in Miami would find other channels to assist their families. "Blood bonds are stronger than any regulations, and sooner or later Cubans will use third countries to send money to their families."
 
Checking the Details
 President Clinton said last weekend that he was prohibiting cash remittances and reducing charter flights to Cuba to punish Fidel Castro for encouraging refugees to flee the island by boat and makeshift vessels.
It was anticipated that the revised regulations would be published today but the process was taking longer than expected. "The regulations will be provided as soon as possible, probably in the next day or two, after completion of an interagency review," said Charles Peacock, a Treasury Department spokesman. "Everyone wants to make sure all the details are correct and all the i's dotted and all the t's crossed."
Most of the Miami shipping agencies are mom-and-pop operations, small family-run businesses perhaps employing 500 people, including about 20 similar agencies in New York, New Jersey and the District of Columbia, which also have large colonies of Cuban-Americans.
Washington's new tough line on Cuba, triggered by the refugee situation, seems to be gaining grudging acceptance by many Cubans in Miami. That acceptance is helped mainly by the conservative hardliners among Miami's Cuban leaders who went to the White House last week and helped shape the policy.
 
In Little Havana
 Mr. Hernandez and Eugenio Morales, general manager of El Espanol, another package shipping outfit with five offices in Miami, said they supported the proposed measures but hoped they would leave room for shipments of food, clothing and medicine.
In the Little Havana section of Miami, contradictions abounded.
People supported any measures taken by the United States that might help bring down the Castro Government. But they openly spoke of circumventing the revised regulations, which are designed to keep dollars from flowing into Cuba and buttressing the island's economy, by keeping up payments to relatives there through Mexico or other countries.
Francisco Gonzalez, 52, manager of a tailoring shop, said he would continue sending money to his sister, though he expressed concern that it might indirectly aid Mr. Castro.
John Zamora, 26, has a half-brother in Cuba and sends him money and medicine. Next month, he said, he plans to visit Cuba by going through a third country and he will be taking money to his half-brother.
 
An Intractable Threat?
 Another element of the new policy that appears to be sinking in is Washington's insistence that refugees transported to Guantanamo Bay in Cuba will not be admitted to the United States anytime soon. After the decades during which political asylum was available to nearly any Cuban who reached these shores, there was skepticism that asylum would not be granted to the "balseros," the collective term -- literally "rafters" -- that is used to describe all the refugees taking to the sea.
Even today, there was a feeling that the warning was being used by high Government officials to scare off those still in Cuba who were thinking of joining the exodus and that it was not an intractable threat that meant the balseros would never set foot on the United States mainland.
"If my brother and his family decide to come over here, going to Guantanamo will not stop them," insisted Felix Perez, the 53-year-old owner of a hardware store in Little Havana. "They will go anywhere as long as they get out of Cuba."
Rubin Avilla Jr., 46, said that his family in Cuba had told him two days ago that his niece and nephew were intent on becoming refugees.
"I beg them not to leave; their mother begs them not to leave," said Mr. Avilla, owner of an alarm company. "They say Guantanamo is better. At least they'll have food and water. I say it's not. They will be detained. At least in Cuba they have family."

HEADLINE: Mayor's Veto of Food Vendor Bill to Stand

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS 

 BODY:
Backing away from a confrontation with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, the City Council has decided not to challenge his veto of a bill that would have allowed food vendors to operate on streets where the Mayor had sought to crack down on illegal vending.
The bill would have allowed food vendors to operate on 17 midtown streets that had previously been restricted and that have been subject to a vigorous enforcement effort by the Giuliani administration. The bill was approved in June by the Democratic-controlled Council by a 40-to-11 vote. 
 But Mr. Giuliani rejected the measure last month, calling it a piecemeal effort to solve a widespread problem. The Council had 30 days to override the veto, and yesterday was the last.
 
Significant Compromise
 The decision not to try to override the veto was a significant compromise between the Mayor and the Council.
Karen Koslowitz, a Councilwoman from Queens who is the head of the Council's Consumer Affairs Committee and sponsor of the bill, said she was persuaded by the Mayor to abandon the attempt to override after Mr. Giuliani agreed to develop a vending plan for the city and after he agreed to consult with her committee and allow it to review the plan.
Mr. Giuliani has vetoed three bills since becoming Mayor. Apart from the vendor bill, he vetoed a measure that would have directed the Water Board to set annual rates at the time the budget is adopted. The third bill gave the Council a role in reviewing most mayoral initiatives to turn over city functions to private companies.
The privatization veto was overridden by the Council by an overwhelming margin. But it took no action on the water-rate measure because the Water Board itself took a step toward setting annual rates when the budget is adopted.
Ms. Koslowitz said yesterday that she expected the administration to develop a plan on illegal vending by the time her committee holds hearings on the issue in November.
"I would like to see something in place by November so that, when spring comes, these vendors can go back on the street," she said. "Now that there is some time, I would like to see a plan that addresses the problem in all the boroughs. But if they don't have a plan in place by then, we might have to act."
The administration says its crackdown on midtown vendors is part of his administration's emphasis on quality-of-life issues. The Mayor has maintained that he is merely enforcing 11-year-old regulations enacted by the Council, under which the Consumer Affairs Department banned food vending from certain congested streets. But before he took office, the regulations were seldom enforced.
Also yesterday, the City Council backed away from its confrontation with the administration over $14 million in unbudgeted spending by the Police Department in last year's budget.
Three weeks ago, members of the Council's Finance Committee refused to approve the Mayor's request to modify the budget to take account of the unexpected costs, half of which comes from higher than anticipated overtime costs.
But yesterday, despite renewed criticism from members, the committee voted unanimously to approve the budget modification, which uses money from the general reserves to pay for the costs. The full Council later voted, 36 to 9, to approve the change.
The committee's chairman, Herbert E. Berman, a Brooklyn Democrat, complained again that the Mayor's office and the Police Department had not explained why costs had crept above what was budgeted.
Mr. Berman said he was not satisfied with the administration's explanation that increased arrests had caused the unexpected overtime costs. He said that, examining the number of arrests in the last four months of the fiscal year that ended in July, each arrest averaged $150 in overtime costs.
 
Extraordinary Expense
 "This is an extraordinary overtime expense per arrest," Mr. Berman said. "Somewhere, someplace, somehow this has got to be brought under control."
Mr. Berman, who announced that the committee would hold hearings in September because overtime costs are projected to rise throughout the city's agencies, then voted to approve the budget modification, followed by the other committee members.
Despite their criticism, members made it clear that they had little choice but to approve the Mayor's request since the money had already been spent.

HEADLINE: THE HEALTH CARE DEBATE: BEHIND THE SCENES;
Health Care's Genial Wheeler-Dealer

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 24

 BODY:
When John Berlinger Breaux, the Louisiana Democrat who is at the center of fading hope for compromise on health care legislation, emerged from a Senate Democratic caucus the other day, a pile of waiting reporters glommed onto him like iron filings on a magnet.
"We're going in circles," the trim, tanned Senator told them with the merest hint of a smile. "But we're moving aggressively." 
 It was vintage Breaux: the genial operator who never gives up on a deal (until he has to) and the discreet negotiator who never gives up much of anything (at least in public). This is a man who likes to say that the best press secretary is not one who can get a Senator's name in the paper but one who can keep it out, and who lives by Earl Long's maxim: "Never put anything in writing that you can convey by a wink or a nod."
These days he may also be something very like an indispensable man.
"In this Congress and under this Presidency, if you want to know where legislation is going to end up, just check where John Breaux is standing," said Lawrence O'Donnell Jr., chief of staff to the Senate Finance Committee, where Mr. Breaux has been a bellwether on issues from President Clinton's failed economic stimulus package last year, to the budget package, to health. "He tends to be in the middle on these things."
 
'No Passion in the Middle'
 Right now Mr. Breaux is in the middle of a last-ditch effort -- he puts its chance of success at "less than 50-50" -- to persuade wavering members of both parties that his modest proposal for increasing access to health insurance and reducing the Federal deficit is worth taking a deep breath and passing. The plan is the work of a group of nearly 20 moderates, led by Mr. Breaux and his Republican colleague John H. Chafee of Rhode Island, that first took shape in the Finance Committee earlier this summer.
But it is a tough sell, and Mr. Breaux knows it. As he explained in an interview today: "There's no passion in the middle. There's passion on the left, and there's passion on the right."
Indeed, the so-called "mainstream" proposal falls so far short of Mr. Clinton's goal of universal coverage that at least one member of the compromise group, Bill Bradley of New Jersey, has withdrawn his support. More liberal Democrats are balking, the Republican leadership looks askance at the whole notion, and Mr. Chafee has signaled limited willingness to revise the plan further.
By his own admission, Mr. Breaux has been all over the map on health care in the last six months, first supporting a plan that relied mostly on market forces, then one to require employers to pay for insurance, then one that might require them to, and finally his latest idea.
He has not drawn the attention that the authors of some rival Democratic proposals have. (He once cracked in his Cajun accent that the free-market plan he co-sponsored with Representative Jim Cooper of Tennessee was seen as the "Coopuh, Coopuh, Coopuh, Coopuh, Coopuh-Breaux bill.") But neither has he drawn as much scorn from the White House and other advocates of universal coverage. The reason may be that they remember the flexibility captured by his most famous quip: In 1981, he explained his support for Ronald Reagan's social spending cuts, in return for concessions on natural gas policy and sugar subsidies, by saying that while his vote could not be bought, "it can be rented."
To his admirers, he is not inconsistent, just flexible, and reflective of the deep strains in his party and in the Senate on health care.
"What I'm trying to do is to find something that will work," Mr. Breaux said simply. "My goal in all of this is to make it work."
 
The Youthful Veteran
 Mr. Breaux is only 50, and constant tennis keeps him fit, but he is a Capitol Hill veteran. He whetted his appetite on the jambalaya of Louisiana politics as apprentice, driver and administrative assistant to the state's then and now reigning rogue: former Representative, current Governor and perpetual gambler Edwin W. Edwards. He comes from the Governor's hometown, Crowley, in Cajun country, where he first won election to Congress in 1972, at age 28.
He won his Senate seat in 1986, built a rock-solid base of rural Cajuns and New Orleans blacks and, to protect his national political standing, has put some friendly distance between himself and his old mentor. Although friends say he has "calmed down a lot" in recent years, he says the best way to keep early-morning appointments is still to stay up all night, and colleagues refuse even to try to clean up the best stories about him for telling in polite print.
"I think the Ragin' Cajun image in some ways disarms people, and then he moves in for the kill," said Larry Harrington, who was political director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee when Mr. Breaux headed it in the 1990 election cycle. "Better than a lot of other politicians, he is capable of having not just a mastery of the substance but an understanding of what is politically do-able."
Mr. Breaux's reputation as fun-lover does not faze him. "I think it's the French heritage, really," he said. "It's a joie de vivre down there, it's a love of life and not taking yourself too seriously, and knowing that you only go around once."
"People where I'm from understand that," he added. "They would hate dull people."
In his soupy voice, "dull" sounds at first like "Dole," as in Bob, the Senate Republican leader, whose scowl has been deepened these days by the work of the Chafee-Breaux group. "Dole?" the Senator giggles. "Dole and Dull."
But Mr. Breaux is deadly serious about his fear: that increasing partisanship and instant, organized, telecommunicated opposition has derailed the spirit of collegiality that he remembers from his early days in Congress. "I'm really concerned," he said, "that we are moving in the direction of having the demand for perfection in legislative proposals be to the detriment to ever getting anything done."
And he is just as serious about his mission: to help his President, a personal friend from their days together in the moderate Democratic Leadership Council, even if doing so means differing with him, as he has on health, or did last year by helping to kill a complicated energy tax in the Finance Committee. "I want to help this President make it work." he said. "There's a lot a stake in having it work. I mean, I'm in fear of a meltdown."
He credits the President and Hillary Rodham Clinton with focusing attention on health but says the White House misdefined the problem early on, by stressing the 15 percent of Americans who have no health insurance instead of explaining to the 85 percent who do that they already pay dearly -- and inefficiently -- for those who do not.
"The Republicans, on the other hand, focused on the 85 percent of Americans who have health insurance, and they scared the bejesus out of those people by telling them that we were going to make their lives worse," he said. "It's much easier to scare people into opposing something than it is to convince them to support something."
So what is his own bottom line?
"I don't have bottom lines," he said. "You can't afford to have them in this business. I mean, we deal with the art of the possible. That's what we have to be guided by: What can we get? What can you do? And as long as it's better than what we have, that's the bottom line."

HEADLINE: THE HEALTH CARE DEBATE: THE CATHOLIC CHURCH;
Catholic Leaders' Dilemma: Abortion vs. Universal Care

BYLINE: By GUSTAV NIEBUHR 

 BODY:
The nation's largest private provider of health care, the Roman Catholic Church, finds itself of two minds when it comes to new health care legislation.
It desperately wants universal coverage. But it cannot live with a provision that many legislators are likely to insist on including: guaranteed coverage for abortion. 
 As a result, the church finds itself pursuing a lobbying strategy that is at the least exceptionally complicated and at the worst paradoxical.
In dioceses from Albany to Yakima, Wash., Catholic leaders are using telephone calls, postcards and personal visits to Congress to make the two-pronged argument summed up in a flier inserted in church bulletins passed out to people arriving for Mass at various parishes over the last month.
"We can have health care reform that does not include abortion coverage and that does provide coverage for all," it says. The flier, distributed by the bishops' public policy arm, the United States Catholic Conference, includes the number of the Capitol Hill switchboard.
In a speech in Washington in May, Joseph Cardinal Bernardin of Chicago declared passionately that "justice and the common good" demanded a thorough restructuring of health care, but he added that "insistence on abortion coverage will turn millions of advocates of reform into adversaries of health care legislation."
Most of the proposals before Congress now include a requirement that Americans be offered a standard package of benefits including "pregnancy-related services," a phrase widely taken to include abortion. But this provision is certain to provoke bitter debate if and when the House and Senate begin serious efforts to pass legislation.
The church's opposition to abortion is, of course, well known. But to grasp the bishops' position, one must understand that the Catholic stake in health care is institutional as well.
As the largest private health care provider in the United States, the Catholic Church accounts for a total of about one of every six hospital beds. Through various dioceses and religious orders, the church operates 566 hospitals, many of them founded by congregations of nuns. They have a disproportionately large stake in the quest for universal coverage, as they treat large numbers of the poor and uninsured.
The hospitals have already been struggling to preserve that sense of charitable mission in the face of the market forces that are reshaping the medical system. Further complicating matters, many institutions are in the midst of a generational handover, as a dwindling cadre of nuns hands over control to lay administrators.
The institutions can be found in every state but Wyoming, and run the gamut from large-scale teaching hospitals to geriatric-care centers, besides inner-city clinics and associations of visiting nurses. They predate the Revolution, going back at least to 1727, with the founding of Charity Hospital in New Orleans.
People who work in these institutions are quick to point out that they are staffed by professionals of many backgrounds and open to patients of any religious faith or none at all. Still, they say, the religious origin and values impart a special dimension to the business of healing the sick. The mission statement of Our Lady of Mercy Medical Center in the Bronx, for example, cites a passage in the Gospel of Matthew (25:40), in which Jesus tells his disciples that to care for "the least" -- the poor, the hungry and the sick -- is to serve God.
 
Long Record of Support
 Given this kind of imperative, the prospect of universal coverage should be a time for profound excitement within official church circles.
After all, the bishops as a body have been on record supporting some form of universal access to health care since 1919, when they declared that "the state should make comprehensive provision for insurance against illness, invalidity, unemployment and old age."
Thirteen years ago, they issued a pastoral letter, calling health care a "basic right" that government must provide. "It is the responsibility of the Federal Government to establish a comprehensive health care system that will insure a basic level of health care for all Americans," the letter said. "The Federal Government should also insure adequate funding for this basic level of care through a national health insurance program."
But the Democratic bills now before Congress that would move the nation much closer to that goal have each included abortion coverage.
Many private insurance policies now provide abortion coverage. Under the major Democratic bills, abortion would be covered as part of a standard package of health benefits guaranteed to all Americans, many of whom have either no access or limited access to abortion.
To be sure, the Democratic bills all include a "provider conscience clause," intended to allow hospitals and doctors to refuse to perform abortions.
But the bishops have said this does not answer their objections, because Catholics would still have to pay into insurance plans that cover abortion, and Catholic hospitals could not ethically join the networks of insurers, doctors and hospitals. Market forces already at work are promoting the formation of these networks, but they might become even more widespread under some of the health proposals now under consideration.
So being left out could prove a financial disaster, the bishops argued in a recent letter sent to everyone in Congress.
"Because they could not agree to coordinate access to abortions or solicit abortion providers to join their network, Catholic facilities could be effectively barred from leading such provider networks," their letter said. "Many Catholic institutions simply may not survive in such a situation."
The letter was written by Roger Cardinal Mahony, Archbishop of Los Angeles, chairman of the bishops' Committee for Pro-Life Activities, and Bishop John J. Ricard of Baltimore, chairman of the Domestic Policy Committee.
At the local level, archdiocesan officials and hospital administrators voice many other concerns as well, a reflection of concern over shifting ground on the business side of health care and deep uncertainty over the level that Congress will finance Medicare and Medicaid programs.
"How does one maintain a sense of ministry, at the same time surviving in a rapidly changing marketplace?" asked Patricia A. Cahill, director of the department of health and hospitals for the New York Archdiocese.
Last month, in a step in that direction, the archdiocese and the Sisters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul of New York said they were committed to creating a network among the 10 institutions they run in Manhattan, the Bronx, Westchester County and Staten Island. Ms. Cahill said the plan was intended to produce a "system of care," a sort of decentralized corporation, rather than a health maintenance organization.
"We're looking to protect a religious mission," Ms. Cahill said. "It is our concern if we do not band together to assure a network based on a shared-values system, over time, we may be picked off," she added. "And into the next century, we would find our ministry and religious traditions lost or seriously weakened."
Few suggest that such a shared-values network would need be restricted to Catholic institutions alone. Last year, for example, Mercy Hospital of New Orleans merged with Baptist Hospital to create Christian Health Ministries, according to the Catholic Health Association, which represents 560 Catholic hospitals.
What complicates the response to market changes for some Catholic institutions is that this is occurring at the time of transition unique to Catholic health care. The vast majority of Catholic hospitals were founded by congregations of religious women, like the Daughters of Charity and Sisters of Mercy, both of them prodigious builders.
Yet since the mid-1960's, the stream of young women entering religious orders has plummeted, sharply reducing the number of members available to run the hospitals, while also causing the average age of the remaining nuns to rise.
At an increasing number of these hospitals, the nuns are turning over the administrative reins to lay men and women. What is crucial, Ms. Cahill said, is for these hospitals to find administrators "in tune with your philosophy," who will be committed to maintain the institutions' essential religious identity and values.
Some institutions have already made the transition.
Founded by Catholic lay women to care for abandoned sick people, and run for many years by religious orders, Calvary Hospital in the Bronx these days cares for people with terminal cancer, a move spurred by the advent of Medicare.
On a wall just inside the main entrance is a framed, hand-letter sign that reads: "Respect Life. What does that mean for Catholic health care?"
But here the sign reflects a concern with more than just abortion. "We're more concerned with the ethical issues at the other end of the spectrum," Frank A. Calamari, the hospital's president and chief executive said.
Standing near a nurses' station surrounded by patients' rooms, Dr. James E. Cimino, co-coordinator of the hospital's medical program, said, "This kind of care, of all the types of care, epitomizes the church's commitment, because we're committed to helping people who are dying." He added, "One of the problems with urban areas like this, a lot of people don't have homes that are comfortable to die in."
Mr. Calamari said he was most concerned about the possibility that Congress would cut Medicare and Medicaid to finance a national health program, which would reduce reimbursements to hospitals like Calvary, forcing them to scale back services.
Equally threatening, he said, would be the emergence of an "unfettered free market" among health care providers, in which profit-makers who provided the least expensive care came to dominate the scene.
"That's why we set up a nonprofit hospital system in this country," Mr. Calamari said. "What works so well with computers, refrigerators and grapefruits is not going to work so well with human beings in sickness and in life."

Officials like Dr. Michael Brescia, above, medical director at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx, fear that Medicare and Medicaid money may be cut to finance a national health program. With Dr. Brescia on Tuesday were Marilyn Crocket, a nurse, and Beatrice Lamberta, a patient. (John Sotomayor/The New York Times) (pg. A17)

HEADLINE: Gender Gap Continues to Close on S.A.T.'s

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 24

 BODY:
Citing significant strides in math and science by women of all ethnic backgrounds, the College Board said today that the male-female gap on Scholastic Assessment Test scores continued to narrow among high school students last year.
Releasing the annual report on S.A.T. scores, Donald A. Stewart, the president of the College Board, which oversees the tests, said: 
 "Since 1987, women have narrowed the male-female gaps in S.A.T. scores by six points for math and verbal, even though they are the majority of S.A.T. takers and come from families with less income and education than men -- factors which tend to depress scores."
 
Black Women Doing Better
 For the past eight years, black women have improved their scores more than any other group on the S.A.T., the most frequently used standardized college admission test. In 1987, the average verbal score for black women was 349, and in 1994, it edged up to 354. In 1987, the average math score for black women was 367, and in 1994, it was 381. For all groups in 1994, the verbal score was 423 and the math score was 479.
White males from higher income groups have historically done best on the S.A.T., prompting complaints that the test has sex and cultural biases. But the board insists it has made strides to eliminate these problems.
In March, the College Board changed the S.A.T. for the first time in 20 years to add more questions to test reading comprehension and analytical skill in math. But most students took the old test this year, and only 3.2 percent took the new test.
At a news conference to explain the results on Tuesday, Mr. Stewart attributed the narrowing gap between men and women, and especially the increase in scores by black women, to better preparation rather than changes in the test.
"This narrowing of the gap has been a general trend for some time now," said Janice Gams, associate director for public affairs at the College Board.
Not unexpectedly, the board reported that students enrolled in rigorous, yearlong courses like pre-calculus and physics did better on the test than those enrolled in semesterlong, standard courses.
Average scores for city and rural students were below the national average because, the board said, these regions tended to have fewer students enrolled in 20 or more yearlong courses than suburban areas.
Starting with this fall's freshman class, New York City plans to require such courses as a condition of graduation for all students. Other cities, like Charlotte, N.C., and Newark, have tried to raise standards, but New York's plan is believed to be the most sweeping in the country.
Eric P. Geisser, director of marketing for Kaplan Educational Centers, which gives S.A.T. preparation tests, said the courses and test success could not be correlated. "Generally those kids taking the more rigorous courses are studying more and more aware of the S.A.T. anyway," he said.
The College Board also noted that grade inflation in high schools was apparently continuing: 32 percent of students had "A" averages in 1994, compared with 28 percent in 1987. But the average S.A.T. score for this same group fell 6 to 15 points. Board officials suspect that grade inflation is part of teachers' efforts to motivate students, said Al Phillips, a data analyst for the board.
 
A.C.T. Scores Released
 On Tuesday, 1994 scores for the A.C.T., or American College Testing, another standardized test for college admissions, were released. Women's scores improved for the third consecutive year, while men's scores dropped. The average male score was still slightly higher than the female score.
Both sets of tests are used in college admissions, but critics say they do not predict a student's success in college.
"The S.A.T. is measuring a set of nonacademic skills which for whatever reason boys excel in, but are irrelevant," said Robert A. Schaeffer, publication education director for FairTest, a nonprofit education organization based in Cambridge, Mass.
 
'20 Years to Close'
 "Based on their own literature, there should be no gender gap whatsoever," Mr. Schaeffer said. "Young women earn higher grades than young men in college. The test is supposed to predict first-year college grades. Moreover, they're bragging that the gap is narrowing, but at the rate its narrowing, it will take another 20 years to close."
The S.A.T has two sections, math and verbal ability. The A.C.T. includes two more, scientific reasoning and reading. Thus, math scores get less weight in the A.C.T.
"The gap between men and women in the ACT is much narrower," said Kate Foster, director of undergraduate programs for Kaplan Educational Centers. 'The A.C.T. is closer to a quarter math, and we've not yet solved the puzzle of why men do better in math."

HEADLINE: In Debate, Change and Record Are Cited

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: NORWALK, Conn., Aug. 24

 BODY:
In the first debate between the two Democratic candidates for governor, John B. Larson proudly embraced his eight-year tenure as president of the State Senate and said he should not be blamed for the state's fiscal troubles.
Although his opponent, State Comptroller William E. Curry Jr., branded Mr. Larson part of the old guard that left the state with a deep deficit at the end of the 1980's and raised taxes, Mr. Larson spent much of the hourlong debate citing his legislative accomplishments as evidence that he was the experienced hand that the government needed. 
 And in perhaps the only dramatic gesture in the debate, Mr. Larson -- the party-endorsed candidate in the Sept. 13 primary -- announced that, if he is elected, he will cut the state income tax by 25 percent, or about $260 million, in his first two years. He declined to elaborate on the proposal after the debate, saying that he would detail the plan in a news conference on Thursday.
Mr. Curry greeted the proposal with skepticism and his spokesman, Roy Occhiogrosso, said, "If he's so committed to the cut, why didn't he propose it this year when he had the chance."
The debate was largely devoid of fireworks, as the two men spoke to each other respectfully and on several occasions seemed to agree on issues like hiring more police officers, improving community policing and using voluntary means to accomplish school desegregation.
Still, they appeared to be trying to expand their bases of support, with Mr. Larson, who is generally considered the more conservative candidate, emphasizing social programs he supports, and Mr. Curry, whose backing comes from liberal Democrats, stressing his fiscal conservatism.
 
Carried on Cable
 The debate was carried this evening on Cablevision's Channel 12 and is to be shown again on Saturday at 8 P.M. and Sunday at 6 P.M and 9:30 P.M.
So far, the race appears to have generated little public interest. The Connecticut Poll, a regular political survey by The Hartford Courant and the University of Connecticut, showed that at the end of July, more than half of 500 randomly selected respondents said in telephone interviews that they did not know enough about either candidate to have an opinion.
The poll had Mr. Larson leading, 32 percent to 15 percent, with a margin of error of 5 percentage points, but the survey was not limited to people who were likely to vote in the primary. With primary turnout generally limited to party stalwarts and those active in grass-roots politics, it is possible that Mr. Curry, who has been endorsed by the state employees union and other labor groups, may be much closer to Mr. Curry than the poll suggests.
Mr. Curry, 42, served two terms in the State Senate before losing a bid for a seat in Congress and then served as the director of Freeze Voter, the political arm of Nuclear Weapons Freeze. In 1990, he defeated the incumbent Democratic comptroller in a primary, using his outsider status as a campaign theme. It is a formula that Mr. Curry is trying to use again.
 
On the Offense
 In his opening statement, Mr. Curry said: "The politicians of this state owe the people of this state an apology. In the best of times, they squandered our tax dollars, watched as our cities eroded and made no real plan for the economic future of this state. For the average Connecticut citizen, state and local tax bills have doubled."
And he added later: "If you're satisfied with the leadership of the General Assembly and the state over the last decade, then I'm not your guy. But if you believe that we need fundamental change, then this is the campaign that gives us the shot to make that happen in Connecticut."
Mr. Curry outlined a program that he said would lead to a cut of $1 billion in the roughly $9 billion state budget. The savings would come from a 5 percent reduction in purchasing, from lowering payroll by not replacing workers who retire and from cutting state mandates to towns and other measures.
This savings, Mr. Curry said, would be given to municipalities to reduce property taxes, a key difference in emphasis between himself and Mr. Larson.
While Mr. Larson was more concerned with the income tax, Mr. Curry maintained that the property tax was a more serious and inequitable burden.
 
Proposal Attacked
 But Mr. Larson said Mr. Curry's proposal was "not real" and that the "money is not there." And he called on Mr. Curry to detail precisely which of the state mandates he planned to drop.
"This would disassemble a large section of state services," said Martha Carlson, Mr. Larson's campaign manager. "Is he talking about prescriptions for the elderly, safety checks on bridges? He needs to say."
In the debate, Mr. Larson, 46, listed the measures he had worked on, from pushing through bills for more prisons to expanding immunizations for children to writing the nation's first family-leave bill. And he emphasized his experience in government, from serving on a city council and school board to running the State Senate.
He criticized Mr. Curry as being "on the periphery," while he "stepped into the arena" to grapple with the tough issues.
"I've already been up there making the difficult decisions," he said, adding later, "I think it's important for the people to understand my record, and I put that record before every citizen of this state."

HEADLINE: Durable Orders Slid 4.2% in July

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 24

 BODY:
Orders for machinery and other big-ticket goods dropped in July by the biggest amount in two and a half years, the Commerce Department reported today, a surprisingly weak figure that tended to allay fears of an overheated economy.
But while today's report of a 4.2 percent slide in orders for durable goods contributed to smart rallies in the inflation-wary bond and stock markets, many economists were skeptical that it reflected a slackening in actual business activity. 
 For one thing, more than half the drop was in the automotive sector, much of which was shut down for two weeks last month. Such distortions are normally smoothed over by the seasonal adjustment process, but this had little effect since adjustment is normally done for August, and the industry now concentrates its annual retooling shutdowns in July.
 
Waiting Is Advised
 "It's wise to wait several months before you conclude any shift in trend has occurred," said John R. Williams, a senior economist at the Bankers Trust Company.
He and other economists said that while there was much evidence that the rise in long-term interest rates that began last fall had taken a toll on some sectors, particularly housing, there was little to suggest there had been much effect so far from the five increases in short-term rates that the Federal Reserve has made since February.
In its latest move, on Aug. 16, the Fed cited "continuing strength in the economic expansion." Its action was denounced by some Congressional Democrats and business groups as unnecessarily risking overkill.
 
Business Groups Critical
 One of these, the United States Chamber of Commerce, seized on today's report to contend that the economy was indeed slowing and posed no discernible inflation threat. Robert D. Barr, its deputy chief economist, said the broad-based decline in durables orders was symptomatic "of an economy slowing in the face of higher interest rates, lower personal income growth and a buildup in inventories -- forces that were with us before the Fed moved to raise short-term rates another half-percentage point last week."
Although the National Association of Manufacturers also expressed concern that today's report "could be signaling a sharper slowdown," most analysts remained skeptical.
"I'm writing the whole thing off," said David Orr, chief economist at the First Union National Bank in Charlotte, N.C. He called the effect of Fed credit-tightening "nil" so far, noting that commercial and industrial loans by banks have been rising sharply of late, not declining.
Bond prices rose modestly in the wake of the report but then settled back, as traders appeared to find in it less weakness than a 4.2 percent drop in orders -- accompanied by declines in shipments and backlogs -- might imply. The financial markets' surge came after a successful auction of Treasury securities in the afternoon.
The orders decline, although severely exaggerated by statistical "noise," was only the second since July 1993 and was the biggest since December 1991, when orders for durables, items from bathtubs to bazookas designed to last at least three years, tumbled 5.4 percent.
The July decline followed advances of 1.4 percent and 1.2 percent for May and June, respectively.
Transportation equipment, the largest sector, dropped 15.8 percent, with aircraft and motor vehicles both lower. Industrial machinery and equipment fell 1.5 percent, and orders for primary metals edged down eight-tenths of 1 percent, the report also showed. Electronic and other electrical equipment, however, posted a gain of eight-tenths of 1 percent.
 
Military Orders Skid
 Military orders skidded a sharp 16.4 percent, with the biggest factor being lower orders at companies making aircraft and parts.
Excluding military goods, however, orders for durables were still down 3.6 percent, while capital goods other than military and aviation items -- a widely watched indicator of the civilian economy -- fell 3.8 percent following a 7.7 percent advance in June.
So far in 1994, overall new orders are still running 13.3 percent ahead of the first seven months of last year, a fact that reassured many analysts. July's $144.9 billion of orders was 12.1 percent ahead of July 1993.
Shipments of durables declined 2.8 percent, to $145.8 billion, following two straight increases, today's report also showed. Unfilled orders edged two-tenths of 1 percent lower, to $424.9 billion, following three straight increases.

HEADLINE: Goods Data Help to Raise Bond Prices

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Government securities surged yesterday on a weaker-than-expected economic report, a better-than-expected Treasury auction and a stronger dollar. The combination lifted the market to its best day since the Federal Reserve raised interest rates a week ago.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 30/32 , to 10016/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from price, fell to 7.46 percent, from 7.54 percent on Tuesday. The yield was the lowest since Aug. 17, when it was 7.39 percent. 
 Stuart G. Hoffman, chief economist for the PNC Financial Corporation in Pittsburgh, called the durable goods figure for July issued by the Commerce Department the economic indicator of the day. "As I read it, it clearly shows a moderation in manufacturing activity, mostly centered in aircraft and automobile orders," he said.
The Commerce Department reported yesterday that orders for durable goods fell 4.2 percent in July, the sharpest drop in two and a half years. The overall number was weaker than expected, easing concerns that the economy might be growing too quickly.
David Cohen, an economist for MS International, said the weakness in durable goods, which includes cars, appliances and other items meant to last at least three years, largely resulted from a drag from seasonal auto plant shutdowns. Orders excluding transportation were still soft, down three-tenths of 1 percent.
"Between auto and aircraft orders, the drop in transportation orders was a big 15.8 percent decline," Mr. Cohen said. "The rest of the report was only slightly weaker than expected."
The report also included a 1.5 percent dip in industrial machinery and a modest lift in electrical machinery, up eight-tenths of 1 percent. "The weak tone of the report cannot be completely dismissed, but it is not as bad as the headline plunge of 4.2 percent seems," Mr. Cohen said.
The bond market will be looking carefully at all coming economic reports to see if any can change the Fed's current strategy.
"With the Fed now in its monetary mode," Mr Hoffman of PNC Financial said, "only real bad inflation and poor economic reports would prod them to move."
A stronger dollar also helped lift the market, Mr. Hoffman said. The dollar rallied against the Japanese yen and other leading currencies yesterday after the Japanese central bank bought dollars.
 
Strong Treasury Demand

 
 The Treasury's auction of five-year notes was a pleasant surprise, giving the market another lift as it turned higher in the afternoon.
Traders described yesterday's note auction as well bid, with noncompetitive bids coming in at a strong $809 million, much more than the average of $622 million. The high yield at auction was 6.91 percent, down from 6.98 percent last month and the lowest since June 1994, when it was 6.77 percent.
Unlike two-year notes, which because of their shorter maturity are sought in bear markets, the five-year issue is often a good sentiment for market sentiment. Until yesterday, analysts said, fund managers and institutional customers had shown reluctance to hold a maturity that long, and dealers have not been especially keen on owning any. With a light auction calendar ahead, analysts expect the market's bullish tone to continue.
The market seesawed a bit as it rose on the weaker durable data and then pulled back a bit ahead of the note auction, which was not expected to sell as well as it did.
The following are the results of yesteray's Treasury auction of five-year notes:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)
 
High Yield . . . 6.91%
Low Yield . . . 6.85%
Median Yield . . . 6.89%

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Up on Intervention By Japanese Central Bank

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar rose against the yen and other leading currencies yesterday after the Japanese central bank bought dollars for a second day.
Rallies in American stock and bond markets also helped the dollar gain, traders and analysts said. 
 "The Bank of Japan is keeping the currency market on its toes this week," said Jim Raphael, assistant vice president at NatWest USA Bancorp in Jersey City.
 
 
$1 Billion a Day
 The Bank of Japan probably spent $1 billion a day in the last two days to keep the dollar from falling toward its post-World War II low against the yen, said David Gilmore, a partner at Foreign Exchange Analytics, a consulting firm. The purchases were the bank's most aggressive since June, he said.
Japanese monetary authorities often try to keep the dollar from weakening against the yen because a strong yen makes Japanese exports more expensive, slowing economic growth.
In trading in New York late yesterday, the dollar settled at 99.01 yen, up from 97.82 yen on Tuesday and its highest level in almost a week. The dollar rose to 1.5473 German marks, from 1.5315 marks on Tuesday. Many traders expect the Clinton Administration to call for a strong yen, or at least let the dollar fall without comment, in an effort to put pressure on the Japanese to cut their $60 billion trade surplus with the United States.
"The outlook is grim for the fall because trade tensions will build," Mr. Gilmore of Foreign Exchange Analytics said.
Buying by the Bank of Japan and rallies in American stock and bond markets gave the dollar a reprieve yesterday, traders said.
 
 
'Looks Cheap'
 The dollar, stocks and bonds were feeding on each other's strength, said David Durst, a trader at Bear, Stearns & Company. "People are buying dollars to buy U.S. stocks and bonds," he said. "The dollar looks cheap" to foreign investors, he said. Stocks and bonds, in turn, benefited from the dollar's relative strength since that made foreign investors more willing to buy United States assets. The dollar's slide this year has cost those holding American assets dearly.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Taxing employee medical benefits may help cure some of the problems in the health care system.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
SURPRISE: Senator Phil Gramm, doyen of the hard right, and the A.F.L.-C.I.O., standard-bearer for the remnants of the New Deal coalition, stand as one on a key element of health care reform.
Well, maybe it is not such a surprise. For the subject is taxes -- specifically, why their constituents should not have to pay more. 
 But it is just such views that are driving economically sophisticated legislators to despair. For many believe that adding new limits on the deductibility of medical benefits -- as called for in two key Senate bills -- could provide both the revenue to extend coverage and the incentives to hold down costs. Indeed, Representative Thomas Petri, a Republican from Wisconsin, offers a sweeping but disarmingly simple tax-based fix for many of the problems that apparently ail the health care system.
Coverage for those who earn too much to receive free benefits from Medicaid but too little to pay their own premiums would cost a bundle. Some cash could be raised from a new cigarette tax, the favorite levy of Americans who don't smoke. A bit more might come from affluent oldsters who pay only a fraction of the cost of their Government health insurance.
But that leaves a big hole, which the plan of the Senate majority leader, George J. Mitchell of Maine, as well as that of the bipartisan "mainstream coalition" would fill with taxes on health insurance premiums. The coalition plan, like other proposals inspired by the idea of "managed competition," would limit the amount of money that could be deducted for insurance premiums to some benchmark figure. Bare-bones coverage would be fully deductible, but more generous plans would not.
That would simultaneously generate revenues to offset the cost of added direct subsidies to the poor. And it would make beneficiaries more sensitive to the financial workings of insurance now provided as fringe benefits. If, for example, richer benefits would add $500 to an auto worker's income tax, he might think twice about the value. "There's just no argument," concludes Joseph Newhouse, an economist at Harvard: taxing medical fringes would make people more cost-conscious.
If modest tax changes would help, how about immodest ones? Representative Petri would go all the way to break what he calls "the third-party-payer syndrome," by counting all medical insurance premiums paid by employers as taxable income.
Harsh medicine? Not really. He would return all the revenue -- something on the order of $92 billion -- in the form of vouchers to cover part of the cost of private medical insurance.
Every family of four would get a yearly voucher worth about $1,800. That is hardly enough to buy insurance, which typically cost three to four times that much annually. But it would be a good start for a working-poor family with an income of, say, $12,000 that pays no income tax. And it would be a better than break-even proposition for a family making, say, $40,000 that currently receives, say, $7,000 worth of untaxed fringe benefits and pays income taxes in the 15 percent bracket. After all, 15 percent of $7,000 is just $1,050 -- far less than the $1,800 value of the voucher.
The losers would be truly affluent earners in the 30 percent-plus tax bracket who now typically enjoy generous, tax-sheltered medical benefits. But, then, somebody has to pay to extend health care coverage. And this revenue approach would offer the bonus of making almost everyone sensitive to costs.
What's more, providing a voucher to everyone, rich or poor, would solve a problem that plagues every health care plan seeking to extend coverage voluntarily -- namely how to entice the near-poor with subsidies without reducing their incentives to earn their way into the middle class.
"Even relatively modest voucher-based subsidies would induce many of the working poor to buy insurance," concludes Michael Chernew and Catherine McLaughlin of the University of Michigan's School of Public Health. But since the subsidy would not change as their income rose, it would not deter work.
A cap on the deductibility of health insurance -- or the more radical Petri approach -- would raise money from the people who could afford it, distribute it to people who need it and create incentives for cost control. Why, then, is the idea so widely scorned?
The ungenerous answer is that the health care debate has brought out the worst in taxpayers. "Politicians will have to try everything first," before they raise the T-word, Representative Petri suggests. The generous answer is that even at this late date hardly anyone outside the health care cognoscenti understands the issues.
Neither answer leads to optimism about the outcome of the health care debate.

HEADLINE: Saving Neighborhoods One Gate at a Time

SERIES: Second of two articles about home security.

BYLINE: By MITCHELL OWENS 

DATELINE: DAYTON, Ohio

 BODY:
GOOD fences may make good neighbors, but iron gates make good neighborhoods. That's the opinion of a majority of the 5,000 residents of Five Oaks, a mixed-income, racially diverse neighborhood five miles north of downtown Dayton.
In 1992, after robberies had doubled in three years, the people of Five Oaks, in collaboration with local police officials, city planners and an urban-design consultant, adopted a crime-prevention technique that has been around for decades but is only now becoming an inescapable feature of the residential landscape -- iron gates designed to rebuff prostitution and drug dealing and the automobile traffic that often supports them. 
 Judging from recent statistics, the results have been striking. Since the 35 iron gates and 26 alley barricades were installed in the fall of 1992, violent crime in Five Oaks has fallen by 50 percent and nonviolent crime by 24 percent, according to a report from Dayton's Office of Management and Budget.
"I am absolutely ecstatic," said Maj. Jaruth Durham-Jefferson, the superintendent of the professional standards division of the Dayton Police Department. She added that in 1989, the arrival of crack cocaine had caused Five Oaks, a half-mile square of modest prewar duplexes and 70-year-old Spanish colonials, to deteriorate from a "pretty stable middle-class neighborhood" to one riddled with "incivilities."
Today, even communities bordering Five Oaks have reported a 28 percent decline in crime. "Criminals don't seem to know where the gates end," said Bernice Gamble, a Five Oaks resident.
Although closing off a troubled street is nothing new, closing off two dozen is. This is the first time an entire neighborhood has agreed to embrace the idea, said Oscar Newman, the urban planner who helped mastermind the Five Oaks strategy.
As crime rates rise, so do the number of neighborhood barricades. Thoroughfares from Coconut Grove, Fla., to Austin, Tex., to Los Angeles have been closed with gates, primarily to stop through traffic and its attendant crime and noise.
In Bridgeport, Conn., 40 intersections in the city's East End have been blocked with concrete barricades to prevent drug traffic and to bring back a sense of community. And in New York City, Greenwich Village residents are lobbying Federal and state officials to block the traffic they expect to flow through the narrow streets if plans for a $380 million redesign of the West Side Highway are not amended.
Gates, once the rich man's preogative, are now becoming an egalitarian option. But even their defenders will admit that gates are not a solution in themselves. They are merely one of the most visible elements of a broader philosophy whose name is becoming a household word among police officers and citizens' groups: Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design, also known as Cpted (pronounced SEP-ted).
"I'm not saying street closures don't work, but there's a bigger picture to consider," said Christine Saum, the executive director of the Mayors' Institute on City Design, a cooperative program developed by the National Endowment for the Arts and the University of Virginia. "Crime prevention can be addressed only on a case-by-case basis, because what works in Dayton may not work in Fort Lauderdale, or even in other parts of Dayton."
One of the effort's primary goals is "to consider how the entire community can work together to combat crime," said Capt. Stan Carter of the Sarasota (Fla.) Public Safety Department. "There has to be more to crime prevention than just putting more cops on the street. Everybody's fighting for funding, but nobody wants to impose higher taxes, and there's a lot of pressure at the municipal level" to do more with less money.
Simple, often inexpensive improvements can often help, from installing brighter street lights to providing safer landscaping: small shrubs and trees with no low limbs provide few hiding places for muggers and rapists. Such improvements, Mr. Newman and other advocates contend, foster an atmosphere of security that can inspire a community to take charge of its space again, improve the appearance of its buildings and rebuild social relationships.
The reconstruction of Bryant Park in Manhattan, which cost $8.9 million and was completed in 1992, included the removal of towering hedges and forbidding walls that had long acted as a sanctuary for crime. "Criminals are like roaches: they like dark spots to hide in," said Bruce Cohen, a spokesman for the Bryant Park Restoration Corporation and the Grand Central and 34th Street partnerships.
In Dayton, Five Oaks' moss-green iron gates, their brick supports ornamented with bas-relief plaques depicting oak leaves, cost $693,375 to build and install. The money was raised through the sale of city bonds.
Police officials said that four years ago, Five Oaks was a stable community, proud of its racial and economic diversity. Then the sound of gunshots started to reverberate, rattling Joan Means. So did the crack-dealing grandmother with a young child in tow who had taken up residence across from the stolid Victorian home where Mrs. Means and her husband, Michael, an associate professor of English at the University of Dayton, have lived for 31 years.
"That 3-year-old child took the drugs to customers parked outside and brought the money back to his grandmother," said Mrs. Means, 61, who teaches English at a vocational high school.
Day and night, she recalled, drivers were using the streets of Five Oaks to avoid delays on Main Street, Salem Avenue and Interstate 75. Drug dealers and prostitutes set up camp along the vulnerable edges of Five Oaks, following what urban-design experts contend is a classic pattern of neighborhood decline.
Homeowners fled, absentee landlords came in and short-term renters with no equity in the community allowed their houses and apartments to fall into disrepair. At the same time Mrs. Means and other members of the Five Oaks Neighborhood Improvement Association were reviewing its long-range goals, Mr. Newman came to town at the invitation of police officials interested in his theories. Groups met to talk about erecting gates in the neighborhood, petitions circulated, and a door-to-door campaigning ensued. By the spring of 1993, the gates had been installed.
"We were able to take back our neighborhood," Mrs. Means said.
The gates transform Five Oaks' grid plan into a maze of mini-neighborhoods characterized by multiple cul-de-sacs and few through streets. Unlike the typical stockade of high walls and fences and air of purposeful isolation, Five Oaks wanted to remain a neighborhood: porous, communal, connected to the life of Dayton.
Consequently, Five Oaks is not impenetrable. Pedestrians can walk around the gates freely. And keys to the gates allow fire, sanitation and other essential city services unrestricted access to Five Oaks as well. But the drive-through traffic and the crime it attracted have been forced back onto the main streets that mark Five Oaks' perimeter, which is exactly where Mrs. Gamble says they belong.
"If you don't live in Five Oaks, then what are you doing here?" said Mrs. Gamble, a member of the Five Oaks Neighborhood Improvement Association.
Today, although some buildings remain boarded up and an abandoned sofa lolls in a littered driveway, most of Five Oaks' lawns are brightly planted, children race bicycles down the streets again, and not one of the dozen people interviewed said he or she was afraid to venture out after dark.
"The way you see it now is the way it usually stays," said Roland Miller, a hospital worker who has followed Five Oaks' rebirth with interest, especially its real estate renaissance. Since the gates were installed, the average sale price of a single-family home has risen from $45,417 in 1992 to $52,017 in 1993, an increase of nearly 15 percent, according to figures from the Dayton Board of Realtors.
Just this sort of economic incentive may prompt more neighborhoods to take crime prevention into their own hands. "Good neighborhoods go bad because people won't fight for them," said Paul R. Soglin, the Mayor of Madison, Wis. To cut down on after-hours crime along State Street, which has been turned into a pedestrian mall in downtown Madison, Mayor Soglin's administration has encouraged restaurants to open sidewalk cafes and local businesses to extend their hours, "any kind of activity that will bring more people into the area," he said.
Mr. Newman, the urban planner, said: "We used to think that we lived in a society with commonly held values and that crime was an aberration the police could deal with. That idea of society is now found wanting."
Mr. Newman, who is an adviser in the Yonkers housing-discrimination case, recently received a grant from the Justice Department to work with 50 neighborhoods in 10 cities around the country to help restructure their physical design and improve security in everything from single-family residential areas to public housing.
Jack A. Nadol, the acting director of the department's Bureau of Justice Assistance, called Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design "a proven method of crime reduction." At the end of September, the department's Comprehensive Communities Program will release about $17 million in grant money to be used for fighting drug-related or violent crime in six cities. They will be chosen from 16 cities invited to submit comprehensive crime-prevention plans, among them Seattle; Baltimore; Wichita, Kan., and Columbia, S.C. Mr. Newman has visited all 16 and made recommendations to city officials on fine-tuning their proposals.
Not everyone is smitten with the idea of street gates. Although Bruce Ramm, a former police officer who now works as a security consultant in Orange, Calif., frequently recommends them, "sometimes they backfire," he said.
"In parts of Southern California, for example, closing off streets reduced drug-dealing," he said, "but it also made the neighborhoods more conducive to gang activity. If a neighborhood is already controlled by a gang, creating cul-de-sacs only gives them more control over the territory."
In Five Oaks, some residents denounce the gates as barricades designed to encourage segregration. "This is just like South Africa, caging people in like this," said Curtis Print, a black resident who works in a manufacturing plant.
Major Durham-Jefferson dismisses the notion of segregation. "I'm an African-American," she said, "so I think I would have noticed" if any of the gates had been racially motivated.
In the future, the Five Oaks Neighborhood Improvement Association plans to try to encourage renters from minority groups to buy houses, working with local banks to provide low-interest loans. And it is asking landlords to restore subdivided single-family houses and duplexes to their original, more spacious layouts. Landscaping and more recreation programs for neighborhood children are on the drawing board, too.
The only universal complaint about gates, one cited by opponents and proponents alike, seems to be that of inconvenience. The gates have transformed a once easily accessible neighborhood into an obstacle course.
Eric Bell, a resident, said that they have ruined life on Harvard Avenue, one of the few remaining through streets. "It's hell," Mr. Bell said. "You can't get your car out to go to work, traffic's backed up so bad."
Mrs. Means, the English teacher who supported plans for the gates, said: "It's dreadful. Traffic's gone up 120 percent on that street alone."
But other members of the association and the Police Department said that residents of the most heavily trafficked streets had only themselves to blame. They pointed out that many renters refused to take part in the review process or ignored the petitions and questionnaires.
Mrs. Gamble, an association member, says she does not mind having to go several blocks out of the way to reach her own garage. "Criminals stay away now," she said. "They may know how to get in, but they don't know exactly how to get out."

A Lesson In Economics Is Ignored

BYLINE: By CLAIRE SMITH 

 BODY:
IF God is truly "in the details," as the saying goes, the major league baseball owners and the striking players must worship different deities.
Because both sides can offer up proof positive that the game is only the way they say it is. 
 The game is healthy, players say. The game is on a collision course with economic disaster, owners say.
So divergent are the courses the two sides take to get from here to there, it often seems as if they are traversing two different planets. Never was that more apparent than yesterday, when 12 owners or their representatives joined in battle for the first time during this strike with the players union. And they offered as their opening salvos at the bargaining table a litany on how the current system is killing many teams and, therefore, must be reworked.
The owners and their representatives gave their interpretations of this crisis, knowing that the 21 players and their union representatives believe the claim to be indefensible. The players as much as said so less than 48 hours before, when the union delivered to the owners a financial analysis of the game.
The report, commissioned by the players but based on confidential figures provided by the clubs, was compiled by Roger Noll, an economist from Stanford University who previously served on the President's Council of Economic Advisers. Noll's report, in one word, is damning. To any argument the owners have yet to offer as reason for their pursuit of a new economic order, that is.
Because Noll charges that baseball has underestimated its expected revenues by between 3 and 8 percent for 1994, which, if one extrapolates from baseball's projections of $1.78 billion, means that another $50 million to $140 million could have come baseball's way this year -- if the strike had not cut the season off as it did on Aug. 12.
Noll calls forecasts of widespread doom fiction. As for those much-maligned player salaries, Noll writes, "Total player compensation in professional compensation, contrary to widespread belief, is not increasing faster than revenue and cannot reasonably be said to be causing a decline in the financial status of the sport."
Richard Ravitch, the owners' chief negotiator, dismissed the Noll report as biased. And the prophecies of doom remain.
Small-market teams, like Milwaukee and San Diego, even big-market clubs, like Boston, Atlanta and the two Chicago franchises, trumpet them. And when the players put the report on the table yesterday, the owners did not even deign to comment on it.
Still, Noll contends such dire predictions are far more implausible in 1994 than 1985, when owners predicted financial disaster only to see their concessions followed by tremendous windfalls in the areas of national and local broadcast revenues.
Now, in 1994, owners are singing a similar tune, saying that the only way to harness financial troubles and turn them around is to harness players' salaries. And, if one takes a Bud Selig, a Jerry Reinsdorf, a Ravitch at their word, that tune just isn't going to change, no matter how many reports the players commission.
So they stand, in the same negotiating room of a midtown Manhattan hotel, but so obviously in different universes.
It does not seem to matter that the public continues to lacerate both players and owners for shutting the game down for the eighth time in 22 years.
It does not seem to matter that the amount of anger will multiply a thousandfold if this fight for money and power kills the World Series, something that the Great Depression, two world wars and an earthquake in 1989 did not do.
Alas, the owners probably won't agree with the economist's conclusions, let alone claim that they've seen the enemy and that enemy is themselves. They didn't buy in when Noll reached similar conclusions in 1985.
It is as if the parties are doomed to play out their roles, the same as in all the previous lockouts, strikes and fights in between. Just as they did in 1985, with the owners as doomsayers, Noll as a naysayer and the players as the grave doubters.
Fourteen days into the strike and no one has come close to breaking out of character. And sadly, as the season slips away, one gets the idea that even if a new interpretation of where the game stands economically were carved in stone and brought down from the mountain, nothing will change. Which may be good for economists as each side lines up more and more expert witnesses. But none of this will ever be said to be good for the game.

HEADLINE: Nigeria's Tarnished Brass

 BODY:
The reckless soldiers who govern Nigeria seem to have a single response to anything that displeases them: Lock up everybody who is out of step, even if that means half the country. Since the country in question happens to be the most populous in Africa, a major exporter of oil and a volatile mix of a dozen cultures, 250 languages and 3 unstable regions, this martial misrule has to be of serious concern to Africa, Washington and the world.
It would appear that the army manual stipulates these rules for dividing, demoralizing and impoverishing a potentially great nation: 
 * If elections are held and voters favor the candidate least liked by the soldiers, then annul the election. That happened in June 1993 when the presumed winner was Moshood Abiola, whose victory would have ended a decade of military rule and for the first time allowed a Yoruba from the thriving southwest to serve as president.
* If the presumed winner refuses to accept defeat, then charge him with treason, hold him incommunicado and ignore court orders to produce him for a judicial hearing. That happened this June to Mr. Abiola, a wealthy entrepreneur and a Muslim whose generous benefactions have given him national standing and a national following.
* If newspapers publish what is obvious to everybody, that these steps have provoked an argument within the military, then silence them. This has happened to a score of publications in Lagos, including the well-respected Guardian, depriving Nigerians of an outspoken free press that has tempered military rule during 24 of the country's 34 years of independence.
* If oil workers demand Mr. Abiola's release and call a strike, then fire the union leaders. This happened after 90,000 of Nigeria's 100,000 oil workers struck, cutting by half the petroleum exports that account for fully 80 percent of Government revenues. But the dismissed labor leaders went into hiding and the protest action continues.
How aggravating it must be to Gen. Sani Abacha, Nigeria's exceptionally inept ruler, that none of this has worked. A defiant federal high court judge has reinstated the dismissed union leaders. The Academic Staff Union of Universities has closed all the country's colleges until the Government recognizes Mr. Abiola's election. Banks remain closed in much of the country despite Government threats to revoke their licenses.
All this has prompted fresh arrests of scores of prominent Nigerians, including former ministers and army commanders, and an order dissolving the five-million-member Nigerian Labor Congress. At this rate, most of the country may soon be in jail, and the entire economy may stutter to a standstill. Before this happens, Americans can only hope that General Abacha, after deep thought, will finally locate a major source of Nigeria's miseries, and arrest himself.

The En-En Document

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration's most revealing policy document laying out "the national security strategy of the United States," no less -- has been kept secret by the fiendishly clever device of making it public.
Issued a month ago in the dead of night, the blue-covered "National Security Strategy of Engagement and Enlargement" was dubbed "the En-En Document" by engaging reporters and enlarged pundits. 
 The struggle over naming the policy engagement (a Gary Hart term favored by the State Department) vs. enlargement (a Tony Lake term favored by the N.S.C. staff) was resolved in a quintessentially Clintonian way: Both are used, conjuring a vision of involved tumescence.
But when a President signs off on a 25,000-word exposition of his global strategy, attention must be paid.
Some of it is silly political posturing: "With U.S. leadership, NATO has provided the muscle that is helping to bring about a peaceful settlement in the former Yugoslavia." Some leadership; some muscle.
The En-En Document -- a serious articulation of this Administration's approach to the world -- deserves academic dissemination and respectful or infuriated analysis by think tanks. It can serve as the basis for "great debate" hearings when Richard Lugar becomes chairman of Senate Foreign Relations in January.
That's because the strategy has become so determinedly anti-controversial that it should provoke controversy. By examining its drafting, we can see its policy evolution.
In an early version of the document, this line led a paragraph in the President's cover letter: "Ultimately, the strength of our security derives from the strength of our values." Gutsy human-rights rhetoric. In the final version, perhaps after the M.F.N. China decision, a line from a pragmatist was brought up from below as a substitute: "Our national security strategy reflects both America's interests and our values."
Similarly, the following fix illuminates a switched emphasis: "We believe that our goals of promoting democracy, protecting our security, and enhancing our economy are mutually supportive" was changed, at perhaps the highest level, to "We believe that our goals of enhancing our security, bolstering our economic prosperity, and promoting democracy are mutually supportive." Different priorities.
A section on European defense, undermining NATO with a controversy-averse "Partnership for Peace," invites debate. "In keeping with our strategy of enlargement, PFP is open to all former members of the Warsaw Pact as well as other European states . . . with PFP the best path toward NATO membership."
That means we are pretending to plan to invite Russia to join NATO, an organization that exists to protect Europe from Russia. The strategy, as stated, is an absurdity. Clinton's "Partnership for Peace" is a device to avert debate about admitting Poland, Ukraine and other Eastern European states into NATO now.
"The aim of NATO's future expansion, however," according to En-En, "will not be to draw a new line in Europe further [sic] east, but to expand stability, democracy, prosperity and security cooperation to an ever-broader Europe."
That's strategic hot air. As Henry Kissinger writes, "The Administration's Atlantic policy is creating two categories of frontier in Europe: those that are guaranteed are not threatened, and those that are threatened are not guaranteed."
The forum for talk of bringing "security cooperation to an ever-broader Europe" already exists in the 52-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. Russia and its former satellites are part of that U.N.-minus-the-third-world.
But NATO is an Atlantic military alliance with a clear purpose to subsume Germany and keep Russians in Russia. It works; it should now include the countries most at risk from any future Moscow yearning to visit the irredentist twice a year.
Foreign relations debaters should use "Engagement and Enlargement" as their text. The near-final draft rang with resolution: "Our national security requires the patient application of American will and resources, and, at times, lives."
The printed version, formally signed by William J. Clinton, recoiled from such boldness: "and, at times, lives" was stricken out.

HEADLINE: U.S. Has Itself to Blame for Cuban Refugees

 BODY:
To the Editor:
President Clinton has made the first real change in Cuba policy in 28 years by "adjusting" the Cuban Adjustment Act of 1966. But by stating once again that he will continue to enforce the embargo against Cuba and the Cuban Democracy Act, the President is allowing a small minority of ultraconservatives in Miami to dictate United States policy. 
 Now Representatives Robert Menendez and Robert G. Torricelli call for a military and complete economic blockade of the island. Cubans will continue leaving the island. We should ask ourselves, Why wasn't there such a flow of Cubans before passage of Mr. Torricelli's Cuban Democracy Act?
United States policy is forcing these people to sea, a policy that first encouraged them to commit such desperate acts through Radio Marti and then encouraged exodus by using hunger and deprivation.
Doesn't President Clinton realize that these raft people, "balseros," as we call them, will eat better and feed their families better in a United States detention camp than in Cuba? I also know that they will consider their chances much better for getting to Miami than for staying in Cuba.
They are not taking to the sea because they lack the right to vote in a two-party election. They are taking to the sea because they cannot bear the hardship anymore of going without electricity, water, cooking oil, chicken, milk, soap, even toilet paper.
The exodus will continue until conditions improve in Cuba. The Administration will have to grant political asylum sooner or later to Cubans who make it to the detention camps because it is the law of the land. The detainees know what to say to be granted asylum. They have heard the script over and over on Radio Marti.
So the United States will have people for three months in a detention camp (paid for with tax dollars) before they join their relatives in Florida. At least they will arrive with a full stomach, now unheard of in Cuba.
Why is President Clinton so afraid to lift the trade embargo against Cuba? Canada, Spain, Mexico, Japan and others consider the Cuban economy free enough to invest in.
It is time this Administration stopped listening to Jorge Mas Canosa and his small expatriate clique, who have not been on the island in 30 years and have no close family suffering there.
Cuban policy is not being made in the real interest of the American people, in the real interest of the United States economy or in the interest of the Cuban-American community.
Representative Torricelli has stated, and I agree, that things in Cuba will get a lot worse before they get better. Of course, he is ready to accept a civil war and bloodbath in Cuba, as well as a mass exodus, with the United States Navy's help. The exodus will continue. The real test for President Clinton is to lift the embargo and normalize relations with Cuba. The emigration "crisis" will resolve itself.

HEADLINE: A Not-So-Odd Mideast Couple

BYLINE: By Stephen P. Cohen; Stephen P. Cohen is president of the Center for Middle East Peace and Economic Cooperation, a small nonprofit organization.

DATELINE: MONTREAL

 BODY:
Like it or not, Middle East peace is in the firm grasp of the same tough and idiosyncratic characters we have hated and distrusted in the regional conflict. Our ambivalence about these Arab leaders is becoming a major obstacle in managing the transition from war to peace -- especially the implementation of the Palestinian-Israeli agreement and efforts to produce a Syrian-Israeli peace, which would transform the region.
Yasir Arafat makes all the decisions for the new Palestinian authority. This frustrates many Palestinians, the Israelis and virtually all foreigners and world economic institutions. 
 President Hafez al-Assad is, of course, the supreme authority in Syria. We so much emphasize this fact that we have trouble believing that he has political constraints other than his own inhibitions and rigid positions.
Both leaders are determined to pursue peace by using the very ideas and methods that they have exploited to retain power in the long years of the conflict. They are convinced that their mastery of internal political complexities and of inter-Arab rivalries, and their careful modulation of the conflict with Israel, have enabled them to survive to this watershed. Their peoples, including their harshest critics, share their basic assumption that only they can bring peace to their nations.
Israeli and American officials are convinced that these leaders are essential. With Mr. Arafat, this acceptance is grudging and contemptuous; with Mr. Assad, it is grudging and respectful, but wary. In light of Syrian and Palestine Liberation Organization terrorism, public opinion, understandably, shares the grudges more than the acceptance.
These Israelis and Americans believe that peace can succeed only if Mr. Arafat and Mr. Assad abandon their old methods and concepts. Thus, while they acknowledge that Mr. Arafat is the decision-maker, they prefer to deal with his politically weak advisers. That is often a mistake, because the advisers -- angry over Mr. Arafat's habit of using money, jobs and threats to control them -- can and do provide advice that is more misleading than helpful.
 President Assad is admired for his strength, but his critics think his conceptual world is rigid and outdated. His emphasis on a comprehensive peace is seen as empty rhetoric, with a touch of a dream of Syrian hegemony. At most, it is accepted as a euphemism for Syrian influence in Lebanon. It is not seen as a shrewd, practical strategy for managing conflict, either within Syria or with Arab rejectionists. Mr. Assad's talk of popular support is dismissed by the West as a code word for iron-fisted control and intimidation. The politics of an autocratic state are certainly not the politics of a democracy, but there are political processes nonetheless. Not only does Mr. Assad seek to maintain his monopolistic control over the multiplicity of military and security forces, he also strives to balance rival ethnic groups and regional interests against one another.
Most of all, Mr. Assad's politics are the politics of maintaining the rationale for rule. Regimes can become captives of their own dogmas and claims. If Syria is the "beating heart" of the Arab world, as Syrians always say, and is pre-eminent in the struggle against Israeli dominance, then Mr. Assad must explain his peace initiatives to cadres of activists who have followed that dogma. The cynical are not as hard to deal with as those who believe too fiercely or those who have built their lives and livelihoods around the maintenance of the security state and the conflict.
Middle East peace is not arriving through the excitement of popular upheaval and overthrow of regimes, as in Eastern Europe. On the contrary, peace is a central part of a calculated policy to prevent such upheaval and chaos. It is a strategy of change to preserve the leaders' rule and to reinforce it as the barrier to extremism and internecine warfare.
Popular upheaval would mean that extremist anti-Western movements that invoke Islam would come to power. It would mean the eruption of ethnic and political rivalries that could tear the societies apart and wreak revenge against former ruling groups. There would be no wave of democracy and pluralism led by enlightened critics of the regime and supported by emerging Western-oriented middle classes. These forces are not yet politically strong enough to win in a no-holds-barred struggle for succession.
The West's desire is to see authoritarian rule replaced by democracy and respect for human rights. We want state socialism and corruption superseded by open-market economies. But to condition our diplomacy in any way on the prospect of such transformations may slow the peace process and bring to power the most bitter enemies of peace and Western values.
Like it or not, the two key figures for the removal of the ideology of hatred toward Israel are Mr. Arafat and Mr. Assad, who pursued that enmity with great effectiveness and ruthlessness. In Washington in July, King Hussein of Jordan provided a respite from this hostility. His formal agreement to end 46 years of enmity to Israel produced a wave of good feeling in Israel and America. His benign image is due in part to his Western manners and style, which contrast sharply with Mr. Arafat's deliberately provocative image.
But the other side of King Hussein's image is his weakness as an enemy of Israel. This heightens the contrast to President Assad's insistence on military strength and unabashed willingness to use force. Still, the King has played a weak hand with panache, dignity and determination. Now that he has played it, we must hurry to strengthen it.
Mr. Arafat exploits his own weakness by masterly and maddening brinkmanship, his unique brand of guerrilla diplomacy. He uses his one credible threat again and again -- that if he fails, the extremists on the left and right will rise and chaos will ensue.
Mr. Assad flaunts his ability to make war while seeking peace. But he can deliver peace. The burden is on him to show that it can be done comprehensively, relatively quickly and with Israel as a full partner.
We should listen with close attention to President Assad's analysis. He has led Syria and the forces of rejection almost throughout the period since the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. No one knows better than he how the logic and emotion of that rejection can be put to rest. He says he is determined to make peace. He is very convincing to those who hear him (as I did on Aug. 16 in Damascus as part of a Council on Foreign Relations delegation) and to those who overhear him.
Mr. Arafat is determined to build his Gaza-Jericho rump entity into a Palestinian state that lives in peace and economic cooperation with Israel. He has already staked his life on that belief and has maneuvered his people into that gamble. Perhaps we should be a little more reticent in denouncing his strategies for controlling Hamas terrorism and building Palestinian institutions. Maybe we can be more creative in developing economic strategies that fit his style of governing.
Israel's leaders are dealing with Arab leaders as they find them. Mr. Assad and Mr. Arafat have decided to make peace. There will be a time for different leaders with other values and practices that are closer to ours. But we will never get to that promising next generation if we undermine today's leaders by burdening the present with our too lofty hopes for the future.

HEADLINE: FLIGHT FROM CUBA: AT THE WHITE HOUSE;
Castro vs. Clinton

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 25

 BODY:
To a limited but important degree, Fidel Castro has done what President Clinton vowed to keep him from doing.
Mr. Castro's actions -- chiefly his decision to permit an unlimited number of disgruntled Cubans to set sail into the perilous Florida Straits on rickety rafts -- have prompted Mr. Clinton to change United States immigration policy, and to change it into something difficult to sustain. 
 If the refugees keep coming by the thousands, the detention centers at Guantanamo Bay will eventually fill to bursting, even after such costly measures as the building of more camps, an idea that was announced on Tuesday, and the evacuation of some civilian workers to make more space available, a measure announced today. And there is no sign of a diminution in the flow, despite all the fervent American warnings; indeed, many Cubans seem more eager than ever to flee, fearing that this may be their last chance.
Officials here admit they have no full answers. So why not grasp the straw proffered by the Cubans? Why not talk about at least some of the issues between the countries, including the refugees?
Mr. Clinton said during a Rose Garden exchange with reporters this afternoon that he was restudying the regulations governing legal immigration by Cubans, and indicated that he would be willing to discuss such questions with Havana.
But on the larger issues -- the refugees and the long freeze between the two countries -- he answered brusquely. The 30-year-old policy of isolating Cuba would stand, he said, "and Mr. Castro knows the conditions for changing that policy."
In fact, Mr. Clinton has said that the United States should never agree to negotiate when it is under foreign attack, and he has argued that what he sees as an effort to destabilize south Florida socially and economically constitutes an attack. Like many another President before him, he has spoken recently of his determination not to buckle under pressure from abroad.
Opening broad-scale talks would be "political suicide," a White House official said this afternoon, but that is by no means a unanimous opinion, even among Democrats.
No doubt such a move would be unpopular with some conservatives, for whom Mr. Castro remains a demonic presence, even though the end of the cold war has rendered him strategically all but insignificant. But conservatives are not likely to be Clinton supporters in any case.
The President's apprehensions, his associates say, are focused on the big Cuban-American colony in Florida, a state whose rapid growth -- it is now the fourth largest -- has increased its weight in national politics.
According to several Florida politicians, Mr. Clinton's decision to prevent the refugees from entering the United States angered many Cuban-American leaders, who were not consulted. He then imposed new punitive measures against Havana and met last Friday evening with a group that included Jorge Mas Canosa, chairman of the Cuban American National Foundation. The politicians said Mr. Mas sought and gained a pledge that the United States would undertake no talks with Cuba.
 
Big Factor in Miami Area
 Cuban-Americans constitute about a quarter, or perhaps as much as a third, of the electorate in Dade County, which is the state's most populous, but account for less than 10 percent of the state total.
In this fall's elections, disillusionment with Mr. Clinton and his party could badly hurt the re-election hopes of Gov. Lawton Chiles, who is already hard-pressed and who in November may have to battle former President George Bush's Spanish-speaking son Jeb. Mr. Bush's wife, Columba, is Mexican-American. At a time when the Democrats are facing trouble in the gubernatorial races in other big states, like New York, California, Texas and Pennsylvania, they are especially eager to hold on to Florida, with its 25 electoral votes.
Other than that, Mr. Clinton stands to lose little in Florida this fall. Senator Connie Mack, a Republican, is considered a shoo-in, and the two majority Hispanic districts in the state are already represented by Republicans. Most Cuban-Americans have been emotionally Republican.
The Democrats have fared poorly in Florida in recent Presidential elections, winning 39, 35 and 39 percent in the voting in 1980, 1984 and 1988, respectively. But in 1992, with three candidates in the race, Mr. Clinton's 39 percent fell only two percentage points short of victory, and he harbors hopes for 1996. The state Democratic Party says that its polls show Mr. Clinton to be the most popular Democrat among Cuban-Americans since President Jimmy Carter.
There is a larger diplomatic dimension to Mr. Clinton's reluctance than generally acknowledged. Representative Robert G. Torricelli of New Jersey, a Democratic specialist on Latin America who backs the President, says the United States "could not accept an invitation to negotiate without granting validity to Castro's tactics in sending people out to die."
"Why should we get involved with a guy who has nothing to deliver to us?" asked a senior State Department official.
But of course, any talks between the United States and Cuba could be limited, and need not entail the lifting of the 30-year American economic embargo with Cuba. At first, experts say, they could be confined to matters like telephone and other communications links between the two countries, drug trafficking and nuclear energy as well as refugee issues.
The Administration is doing all it can to establish normal relations with the few nations that still embrace Communism as well as those that were stranded by its collapse in Moscow. Mr. Clinton chose not to go to the mat with China over human rights. He has agreed to open a mission in Hanoi and announced his intention of opening diplomatic relations with North Korea.
Yet he rejects talks with Havana. Members of Congress and others find that hard to understand.
 
'Foolish,' Dodd Says
 Senator Christopher J. Dodd, the Connecticut Democrat, argued this week that it was "mindless and foolish" to talk to dictators around the world yet refuse to talk to Cuba "because of parochial politics." On Friday, a Task Force on Cuba put together by Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington research group, will call for talks not only on short-term questions but on the whole relationship.
Returning the refugees to Cuba does not seem a live option. For one thing, it is not at all clear that Mr. Castro would accept them; besides, that would defy the profound American belief in comforting the oppressed. Nor is a naval blockade in the cards, given the trade between Cuba and important American allies.
The President, who was stung politically in 1980 when Mariel boat people held in Arkansas rioted during his governorship, talks often to his aides about that incident, making it clear that above all he is determined to keep the latest throngs of refugees from entering the United States.
So unless Mr. Clinton negotiates, he must hope that one of two things happens soon: Either there is an uprising against Mr. Castro, hastened by the political and economic pressures he is applying, or Mr. Castro decides, for some reason, to halt the flow of refugees. But again, it is the Cuban who occupies the catbird seat.
In Eastern Europe five years ago, Communist dictators tried to keep people from fleeing to the West. It did not work, and their regimes disintegrated. Having watched what happened, Mr. Castro is unlikely to make the same mistake. While he might miscalculate, he is likely to keep the valve of emigration open to let off the steam of popular discontent.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
One Manager's Little Gamble Prompted Big Shift in Stocks

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
A strategy designed to earn the smallest of profits -- about an extra 1 percent a year -- backfired late Wednesday and played a major role in sending the Dow Jones industrial average up more than 70 points.
That surge, which was followed by a slump in stock prices yesterday, shows how the stock market can be roiled by little-known strategies using sophisticated securities. 
 The money manager whose strategy is being widely credited -- or blamed -- for the explosive move late Wednesday said yesterday that he was stunned by the action. "I'm surprised it could have that kind of effect," said William T. Mullen of Loomis, Sayles & Company. "We're talking about less than $100 million of stocks," he said of the trading that appears to have been set off by his strategy.
Much of the impetus for the stock market's surge came from the unraveling of Mr. Mullen's complex investment strategy that used a type of security not widely understood on Wall Street. The strategy turned on him, prompting other traders to scramble to protect themselves from losses and still others to buy in the hope of making their gain bigger and Mr. Mullen's loss larger.
Mr. Mullen's gamble -- essentially a bet that stock prices would not rise very rapidly -- was not the only factor in the stock market rise Wednesday, which was also influenced by a report of weak orders for durable goods like cars and appliances and by nice -- but smaller -- rallies in the currency and bond markets.
But in all likelihood it would have been a much quieter day had not Mr. Mullen chose to place a large bet to be won or lost on closing stock prices Wednesday. The reaction of other stock market players, evidently including those who had taken the opposite side of some of Mr. Mullen's bets, were an important impetus in the final leap in prices, which sent the Dow up 40 of its 70.90 points in the final two hours of trading.
But when trading ended Wednesday it was still a mystery to many why stocks had rallied so sharply. Only yesterday did many traders begin to decide that the surge was not caused by investors with confidence in corporate earnings and the economy, the usual reasons for a jump in prices.
To figure out Wednesday, traders and analysts had to learn about "flex options," another of the specially designed securities being invented regularly by Wall Street to allow traders, investors and speculators to do everything from minimize their losses to eke out a few extra percentage points of return.
The move appears to be the first sizable one clearly traceable to the flex option, which is named for its flexibility because it can expire on almost any day. That means the volatility brought on by the scramble to avoid losses or solidify gains on the day the option expires can happen at any time, rather than only on the third Friday of a month, the time normal options expire.
That volatility stems from the fact that a wide variety of financial instruments -- including futures, options and swaps -- enable money managers, traders and others to shift part of the risk that comes with their investments to others, who can, in turn, shift part or all of the risk to someone else using another kind of financial instrument. It is often impossible to know where the risk has landed, or even in what instrument.
"The marketplace has gotten used to dealing with the volatility that can occur around standard option expirations dates," said Tom McManus, a strategist at Morgan Stanley. But, he added, this was something new.
Mr. Mullen, who manages money at Loomis's Washington office, does his trading in stock index options, usually trading the most popular stock index options -- those on the Standard & Poor's 500 and 100 indexes. But in this case he traded a lesser known index, the American Stock Exchange institutional index, which is based on the performance of 75 large stocks. That index includes such household names as Ford Motor, Caterpillar, Sears, Roebuck and Eastman Kodak, all of which advanced strongly Wednesday and then fell back yesterday.
Index options enable a buyer to make big money if he can correctly forecast the direction of a stock market index. Mr. Mullen's strategy is to sell options that will be worth money to the people who buy them from him only if the stock market rallies at least 5 percent over the next month or two. If that happens, he can lose money. But most often it does not, and his clients profit because the options expire worthless while they keep the fee they earned when they were sold.
His goal is to take in enough money from selling options to enable his clients -- mostly pension funds -- to earn about 1 percent a year above what they would otherwise earn from their stock market investments. He now uses that strategy to write options on about $8.5 billion of stock investments, a figure that has more than doubled in the last two years as more and more pension funds have signed up.
About six weeks ago, Mr. Mullen said yesterday, he sold 2,000 option contracts on the Amex institutional index, covering almost $100 million in stocks. The options were of the new flex type and were to expire at the close of trading Wednesday. If the index closed at or below 468, the options would be worthless, and those who bought them from Mr. Mullen would be losers, having paid a fee for the options but gotten nothing. But every hundredth of an index point above 468 would require Mr. Mullen's clients to pay $2,000, a dollar for each contract.
The index, which had ended Tuesday at 466.76, spent much of Wednesday below 468. But it went above that level a bit before noon, and after dipping back to it a little after 1 P.M. it was off to the races. At the close, the index was at 471.74, and Mr. Mullen's position, which looked in the morning as it if would end the day costing him nothing, actually cost $748,000. But Mr. Mullen said that those losses did not come close to wiping out the profits his clients had made earlier in the year from using the same strategy.
Those were not the only options that expired with a profit on Wednesday. The others were 4,000 contracts on the Amex major market index -- an index of 20 stocks designed to mirror the Dow industrials. Those contracts were clearly in the money long before Wednesday arrived, meaning that those involved in them had more time to react to offset projected losses or enhance gains and were less likely to have been scrambling late Wednesday.
It is at this point that what happened Wednesday afternoon becomes less clear. It appears that those who bought the options from Mr. Mullen had not been speculating. Instead they were brokers who regularly deal in options and bought them because Mr. Mullen is a good customer. So they laid off the risk they had incurred by buying the options by taking positions in other markets, possibly by selling stocks short -- that is borrowing shares and selling them, hoping to buy them back later at a lower price. They also could have sold other products, like stock index futures. As Wednesday went on, they decided to buy stocks, effectively canceling their own hedge. That buying, much of it in the final minutes, helped to push up prices even more.
"In the last half-hour, when the market did not come down, apparently there was a lot of effort to cover shorts," said Laszlo Birinyi of Birinyi Associates, a market analysis firm.
Flex options have been around since February 1993. But it is only this year that they have really come into their own. Flex options on the S.& P. 500, the most popular such contract, covered $3.6 billion of stocks at the end of last year, a figure that had more than tripled to $12 billion by the end of last month.
By Wall Street standards, the size of Mr. Mullen's trades were not large. But the reaction to them -- coming late on a day when traders are not accustomed to looking for options-related volatility -- came as a shock and no doubt led some to believe that the market was moving for other reasons more closely related to fundamentals and economic expectations. And that helped to set off buying that moved the market and left a lot of analysts shaking their heads.

Mullen, managing partner for Loomis, Sayles & Company, and played a big role in the 70-point surge of the Dow Jones industrial average on Wednesday.

Chart/Graph: "A Strategy Wnt Awry, and the Market Soared"
 William Mullen of Loomis, Sayles & Co. adopted an investment strategy that was designed to make money if the stock market did not rise sharply. Perversely, that strategy helped to cause Wednesday's big rise in share prices.
 
WHAT HAPPENED
 1. In July, Mr. Mullen sold 2000 flex index options tied to the performance of the American Stock Exchange Institutional Index, betting that the stock market would not rally sharply before Wednesday Aug. 24, when the options expired. If the market did not advance at least 5 percent by then, the options would be worthless to their buyers when they expired. The options are called flex options, short for flexible, because they can mature on almost any date.
 
BEHIND THE SCENES
 1. An index option is a security that allows an investor to bet on the performance of a stock index without having to buy any of the stocks that make up the index. The index option is bought with cash for a premium. When the option expires, if the index is above the stated value, it is "in the money" and the buyer of the option is paid the difference between the actual index value and the stated figure.
 Most index options expire on the third Friday of the month, but flex index options can be set to expire on almost any date.
 Among the indexes options are sold on are the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks or the American Stock Exchange Insitutional Index, which includes 75 stocks that are popular with major institutional investors.
 
WHAT HAPPENED
 2. On Aug. 24, the stock market began to rally early, propelled in part by the unexpected sharp decline in orders for durable goods in July, a sharp rally in the dollar and hopes that the Federal Reserve would be able to delay another interest rate increase until near the end of the year. The American Stock Exchange Institutional was up at noon, but not high enough yet to put Mr. Mullen's index options "in the money" and make profit for the buyers.
 
BEHIND THE SCENES
 2. The Dow Jones Industrial Index was up 23.63 points at 1 P.M., but ended the day up 70.90 points.
 The 4.2 percent decline in durable goods signalled that the pace of economic growth is slowing. If that is the case, there will be less pressure on production capacity, which means less pressure on prices.
 
WHAT HAPPENED
 3. But by 1 p.m., the Dow had jumped 24 points and the American Stock Exchange Institutional Index was up 1.81 to 468.57. That suddenly put all the 2000 flex options Mr. Mullen had sold into the money.
 
BEHIND THE SCENES
 3. Because this is the day that the option expires, Mr. Mullin has to pay up. In the end, the American Stock Exchange Institutional Index closes at 471.74 and Mr. Mullen pays $374 for each contract, or $748,000.
 
WHAT HAPPENED
 4. As the options moved into the money, several traders and analysts said that buying of stock by people who had bought the flex index options from Mr. Mullen helped push stock prices higher.
 
BEHIND THE SCENES
 4. Traders said there were two reasons for this late day buying.
 One is that Mr. Mullen sold his index options to other brokers on Wall Street who make a business of dealing in options and buy them to satisfy customer needs. But they do not want to make the bets implied, and so they made other trades to offset their risks. Those other positions became losers when stock prices began rising and the brokers scrambled to buy stock.
 That buying was at first interpreted as a wave of institutional demand for stocks, not as an aberration brought on by the options. So others bought, trying to get in on the trend.
 
WHAT HAPPENED
 5. The stock market got another push from investors who have been betting generally that the stock market, which was down 5 percent from its January all time high as trading began Wednesday, would continue to decline. So they also sold stocks they did not own in hopes of buying them back at lower prices to make a profit. To cut their losses, many of them bought stocks as prices soared late Wednesday.
 
BEHIND THE SCENES
 5. On Thursday, the stock market took a breather, with the Dow falling 16.84 points to 3829.89. The American Stock Exchange Insitutional index ended at 470.27, down 1.47. (pg. D4)

HEADLINE: FLIGHT FROM CUBA: IN CUBA;
For Cubans Facing Sea: Last Chance

BYLINE: By MARIA NEWMAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: HAVANA, Aug. 25

 BODY:
Neither the fierce rains whipping the palm trees today nor the harsh new measures by President Clinton were going to keep Juan Carlos Gonzalez from making another attempt to take to the sea in search of a new future in the United States.
In fact, thousands of people like Mr. Gonzalez, fearing this may be their last chance to leave the country, are speeding up their exodus, rather than hesitating over the uncertainty of the voyage. 
 "Maybe if I wait, things will change here," Mr. Gonzalez said. "Maybe things will improve economically here for people. Or maybe tomorrow they will let me leave on a plane. But I think this is the moment. It is my destiny to go now."
All along a stretch of the Cuban coast, from the Malecon Boulevard in downtown Havana to Cojimar several miles east where Mr. Gonzalez waited, small clusters of Cubans could be seen bobbing in the water. Others were on the beaches, bartering for provisions and making final arrangements to leave now, rather than waiting for a change in either the weather or politics.
Mr. Gonzalez said he first tried to leave on Saturday when he and five friends boarded a boat crafted of inner tubes and boards. After almost 40 hours at sea they were out of water and food. One became ill, saying he was hearing voices and insisting that he could walk on the water. With no rescue boat in sight, the dejected group decided to turn back. Mr. Gonzalez showed his palms marked with blisters by his ordeal.
A worker in a perfume and soap factory, Mr. Gonzalez said he earns about $3 a month and makes candies on the side to help his household of six, including his parents. As the youngest son, he has an obligation to try to find a different life, he said.
And so this morning he looked again toward the treacherous sea. Along the beaches in Cojimar, many people were aware of the dangers and said they had seen bodies washing ashore. But Mr. Gonzalez said he was determined to go.
"To me the most beautiful thing in the world is Cuba," he said softly. "But truthfully it hasn't worked. I don't know if it is the fault of the United States or of those who govern us here. Politics don't interest me. I only want to provide a good life for my mother and myself."
Every day those who want to leave are becoming more brazen about their attempts -- leaving in broad daylight, in view of the lovers strolling along Havana's seaside boulevard, in sight of the foreign tourists who are a mainstay of the economy.
"I think it will be Clinton who will stop this first, so we must hurry," said Roberto Carlos Rivera, who was waiting to take off in his boat. "We hear that the American people are beginning to protest that so many of us are going over."
For the first time in years, President Fidel Castro has called off the coastal patrols that in the past had guarded the shore to prevent Cubans fleeing by sea and is now allowing Cubans to flee unimpeded.
After heavy rains Wednesday night, another downpour was drenching Havana by midday today, whipping palm trees in high winds and forcing those on the beach to take cover under the canvas sails they had planned to use at sea. By late afternoon, the skies were still gray but the ocean looked calmer, and there was more talk of setting out.
Most people on the beach said they knew they could end up at the Guantanamo Bay naval base or another military camp. They said they knew it might be weeks or months before their applications for asylum would be granted. But for most it was almost an irrelevant point.
"The most frightening choice would be to stay here," said a man who would only identify himself as Rodolfo. "You don't know hell until you've lived here."
 
Patriotism for Pork
 He said that this month the Government provided each member of his family with a quarter-pound of pork. "It had been years since we had seen pork," he said. His family subsists on rice and soy beans, usually cooked without oil because that, too, is scarce.
Because much of the news they receive comes from word of mouth, many Cubans were ill-informed about the extent of President Clinton's punitive measures. But rumors were passing rapidly from one bunch of would-be refugees to another.
"I heard that England is taking 50,000 refugees," said Felix Perez, who is 35. "We also heard that Julio Iglesias is offering to take 100 Cubans."
With the same urgency of those who wanted to go, entrepreneurs were taking advantage of an opportunity. One group was selling a rubber and wooden boat for $1,200. Another man was trying to peddle an inner tube for $50.

 Beyond the coastal areas the discontent that was driving so many people to take to the sea was less evident. Workers continued on to their jobs on bicycles or waited in long lines for the state-owned buses that trailed black smoke.
All along the boulevards, especially those facing the United States, messages of the revolution, some in six-foot-tall letters, were written.
"Into battle with our morals and our principles, secure in our victory," one sign proclaimed.
Another said: "This land is 100 percent Cuban."
 
Front-Porch Politics
 In Old Havana three men were sitting outside their apartment building, a crumbling relic of a once-beautiful Colonial-style house. None of them said they planned to leave, but it was not necessarily because they supported Mr. Castro.
"Let them all go, so there will be more food for everybody else," said Carlos Moises Menendez, who stocks food shipments for a living. "I see food all the time but I can eat none of it."
His neighbor, Carlos Marcelino Iglesias, said: "They should allow one quarter of us to go. But let's send them in seaworthy vessels, not these flimsy rubber and wood contraptions."
They complained about how the economy has strangled the average Cuban. Their apartments are state-owned and they are falling down piece by piece on passersby. The utilities are also state-owned and the electricity often fails.
 
Tuning Out Castro
 They can watch state-owned television for only about four hours a night, but they said they did not bother listening to Mr. Castro's address to the nation on Wednesday night.
The gas for their stoves is available only after 6 P.M. "We have to cook tonight what we want to eat tomorrow," Mr. Iglesias said.
All three work for the Government and say their wages will not allow them to afford Government-subsidized food. Moreover, the Government is always out of food, they said.
"I can't remember the last time I ate beef," said Mr. Iglesias.
Mr. Menendez added, "I got a quarter-pound last month but I let my son eat it."
 
Waiting for a Chance
 All three said that if they had the opportunity they would leave Cuba.
"But not like that in these risky boats," said Mr. Menendez.
"That is like sending people to their deaths," said another neighbor, Jose Miguel Garcia.
Since the fall of the Soviet Union, Cuba has struggled to survive economically. Certain sectors of production were cut back to put the emphasis on agriculture, health and tourism, which brings in much-needed foreign currency.
The official exchange rate of the Cuban peso to the dollar is one to one, but anyone on the street can tell you that a dollar will buy about 120 pesos.
 
2d Class of Citizens
 All tourists must pay in dollars, and those who work in the tourism industry get dollars, especially from tips, so they have access to certain goods not available to others. The three men said it has only created a second class of citizens.
Mr. Iglesias earns 120 pesos a month as a construction worker. A bottle of cooking oil, he said, costs 200 pesos and a pair of pants 1,800 to 2,000.
Yet, he and his neighbor said they would not take the risk of fleeing, even though they have the biggest chance ever in the years.
"The only ones who are leaving are those who can no longer stand this," said Mr. Menendez. "I wish them well."

 One money manager's small gamble played a big role in the surge in stocks on Wednesday, when the Dow jumped 70.90 points. Much of the impetus for buying on Wednesday came from the unraveling of a complex investment strategy involving the trading of less than $100 million. The surprising surge that resulted shows how the market can be roiled by little-known strategies using sophisticated securities. Floyd Norris: Market Place. [Page A1.]

HEADLINE: Gore Wants U.N. to Leave Abortion Up to Each Nation

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 25

 BODY:
Vice President Al Gore said today that although the United States will insist at a United Nations conference next month that every nation should decide for itself whether to permit abortions, the United States would never assert that a woman's right to choose an abortion should be internationally guaranteed.
Mr. Gore, who will head the American delegation to the International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo in two weeks, defended the Clinton Administration's policies on issues to be discussed there. 
 The draft program to be debated in Cairo has been strongly criticized by the Roman Catholic Church, which opposes abortion and contraception, and by some fundamentalist Islamic leaders, largely for the same reasons. The draft's final position on abortion and other issues is still being negotiated.
The current draft calls population policies "the sovereign right of each nation, consistent with national laws and in conformity with international human rights standards." It urges nations to insure universal access to health-care services, and one point in the dispute over abortion and contraception is whether they are included in those services.
In a speech to the National Press Club, Mr. Gore defended the Administration's position at length and in detail, but broke no new ground. The Vice President reaffirmed the Administration's position that abortions should be "rare" and that a key to insuring this is to make contraception widely and readily available.
 
Consensus Is Seen
 Mr. Gore's speech was arranged hastily this week at the White House's initiative in an attempt, he said, to make sure that news reports of the Administration's dispute with the Vatican did not obscure what he called a broad consensus behind the United Nations program.
"Sometimes if the focus is only on the disagreement and only on the controversy, the real substantive development can be missed," Mr. Gore said. "The real substantive development here is the remarkable range of consensus, the dramatic change in the way in which the world views this critical challenge, a challenge which many view to be the most critical challenge humankind faces in the next century."
The Vice President cited the draft program's calls for supporting education, women's rights, children's health and economic development as tools to rein in the global population explosion.
He said the Administration does not promote abortion, nor does it view abortion as an appropriate method of family planning, and it condemns any coercive abortion, whether legal, economic or psychological.
"We believe that decisions about the extent to which abortion is acceptable should be the province of each government within the context of its own laws and national circumstances," Mr. Gore said. "Therefore, throughout these negotiations, we have supported language and sought to have added to the text, language that clearly establishes this principle for all of the Cairo recommendations. And we fully expect, and will insist at Cairo, that this principle be affirmed in the final document."
He added: "Let me be clear, our Administration believes that the United States Constitution guarantees every woman within our borders a right to choose abortion, subject to limited and specific exceptions. We are unalterably committed to that principle. But let us take a false issue off the table. The United States has not sought, does not seek and will not seek to establish any international right to an abortion. That is a red herring."
The same principle, he said, should apply to contraceptives: nations have the right to make them legal, but the United Nations is not seeking to establish a basic human right to their availability. Mr. Gore made clear, however, that the Administration wants contraceptives and information about contraception to be widely available.
"Our view is that the most effective way to reduce population growth and abortion is through a comprehensive global strategy that makes family planning information and services as widely available as possible, that promotes sustainable economic development, that increases child survival rates and literacy, that fosters women's health, that strengthens families, and that focuses on the education and empowerment of women," he said.

Islamic Suit Against Parley
 CAIRO, Aug. 25 (Special to The New York Times) -- A group of Islamic lawyers and a leading Muslim fundamentalist preacher have filed a lawsuit seeking to prevent a United Nations conference on population from being held here.
Three lawyers and Sheik Hafez Salama, the popular head of an Islamic religious society, joined both moderate and hard-line fundamentalist groups in condemning the conference, which they regard as a plot to spread "corrupt" Western values in the Muslim world.
"This conference will deal with topics that are against the traditions of Islam," said one of the lawyers, Abdel Halim Mandour, who has defended some of Egypt's most militant Muslim figures, including Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, the cleric being held in the United States in connection with an alleged bombing plot. "They are encouraging sex outside marriage, homosexuality and abortion."
