White House Says Mexico Cooperates in Drug Effort
The White House announced that Mexico was "fully cooperating" in the fight against drug trafficking. It brushed aside an analysis by the Drug Enforcement Agency that concluded that recent steps taken by the Mexican Government had had little success. A1
 
A United States official said one longtime drug trafficker, Rafael Munoz Talavera, had emerged as a leader in the battle to fill the leadership vacuum caused by the death of Amado Carrillo Fuentes, Mexico's most influential drug trafficker. Mr. Munos has ties to the cartel that Mr. Carrillo led. A7 

Chirac Reluctant to Strike
President Jacques Chirac said that France would not support an automatic military response if Iraq failed to live up to its latest pact on inspections. Mr. Chirac's popularity is soaring in opinion polls because of the credit given to French diplomacy in avoiding an attack on Iraq. A8
 
United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan moved quickly to rebut criticism from Congress and elsewhere that he had knuckled under to Saddam Hussein by creating a special arrangement for inspecting the eight presidential complexes that the Iraqis previously put off limits. A8
 
U.S. Critical of Suharto
The Clinton Administration has concluded that President Suharto has once again sent the effort to rescue Indonesia wildly off track, ignoring most of the commitments he signed six weeks ago with the I.M.F. The Clinton Administration and the monetary fund must now either threaten to suspend the economic rescue and risk the further collapse of the Indonesian economy, or let Mr. Suharto undermine the fund's credibility by taking its money and ignoring its dictates. A3
 
Swiss Confirm Mossad Incident
Swiss authorities confirmed reports that five agents of Israel's Mossad were caught last week trying to bug a house in Bern, the Swiss capital, and that one was in detention. It remained unclear who owned or used the house. Some Israeli reports said an Iranian diplomatic mission was the target, but Swiss officials denied any link to Iran. A9
 
Palestinian Census Released
Results of the first Palestinian census were announced, showing 2.9 million Palestinians in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem. The figure published by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, a branch of the Palestinian Authority, was far higher than previous Israeli estimates, which showed about 1.8 million Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and 180,000 in East Jerusalem. A8
 
Yeltsin's Criticism
In a special Government meeting that was half encounter group and half show trial, President Boris N. Yeltsin lashed out at his Government for failing to correct the country's ailing economy, and he threatened a Cabinet shake-up. A4
 
NATIONAL A10-22
 
Campaign Finance Effort Falters in the Senate
The Senate all but buried campaign finance overhaul efforts for at least another year. In successive votes of 51 to 48 and 45 to 54, the Senate first failed to end debate on the main bipartisan overhaul bill and then on a competing proposal by Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican leader, aimed only at organized labor. It takes 60 votes to cut off Senate debate and force a vote on legislation. A1
 
Clinton Aide Is Questioned
Sidney Blumenthal, a senior adviser to President Clinton, spent two hours under questioning before the Federal grand jury investigating the Monica S. Lewinsky affair. Mr. Blumenthal said that the independent counsel, Kenneth W. Starr, had summoned him to the grand jury to have him interrogated about whether he was spreading dirt on Mr. Starr's lieutenants to reporters. A1
 
Winfrey Wins in Court
A Federal jury in Amarillo, Tex., ruled that Oprah Winfrey bore no liability for a television program of hers that explored whether "mad cow disease" threatened the country's beef supply. Texas cattlemen had asserted that the broadcast touched off a drop in cattle prices and cost them millions of dollars. A10
 
The Cost of Preservation
Federal officials announced that wild Pacific salmon are nearly extinct and put major urban areas on notice that millions of people are likely to face disruptions and higher living costs if the fish are to be restored as the law requires. A10
 
State Payments for Suicide
The state panel that runs Oregon's health plan voted to spend tax money to pay for doctor-assisted suicides of terminally ill poor people. A10
 
Bombings Are Linked
Federal authorities have uncovered physical evidence that for the first time links the fatal bombing at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996 with bomb attacks at abortion clinics in Atlanta in January 1997 and in Birmingham, Ala., last month, law enforcement officials said. A21
 
Church Leader Is Staying
The Rev. Henry J. Lyons, president of the National Baptist Convention, U.S.A., held a news conference in Nashville a day after he was charged with racketeering and fraud in Florida. Mr. Lyons, who was accused of stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars intended for the denomination and the rebuilding of burned black churches, declined to discuss the charges but gave no indication that he was considering resigning. A20
 
Bible Course Settlement
A public high school course in Florida that was designed to teach the Bible as history will be renamed, and students will be required to take world history or comparative religion along with the Bible course, according to an out-of-court settlement among school officials, parents and civil liberties groups.

U.S. Indicts 5 Officers In Brooklyn Brutality Case
The Federal Government formally took over the prosecution of four police officers accused of brutalizing Abner Louima, a Haitian immigrant, in a Brooklyn police station last summer. A Federal grand jury indicted the officers on charges of violating Mr. Louima's civil rights, and it expanded the case by indicting a fifth officer, a sergeant, on a charge of helping the other four cover up the incident. The sergeant and one of the other officers were also charged with violating the civil rights of a second Haitian immigrant, who the authorities said was also beaten and then falsely arrested. A1
 
Masur to Stay Until 2002
Kurt Masur and the New York Philharmonic agreed to extend the German maestro's contract as music director to 2002, but they also agreed to plan for an eventual successor. Mr. Masur, who is 70, had complained that he had been pressured to retire from the post he has held since 1991. B1

HEADLINE: 4 Indicted in Immigrant Smuggling Scheme

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON 

DATELINE: EL PASO, Feb. 26

 BODY:
A Federal grand jury today indicted a former Olympic bicyclist from Iraq and three others in a scheme to smuggle hundreds of people from the Mideast through Latin America and the Caribbean and then on to Mexico, where they crossed the Rio Grande to their ultimate destinations in cities including Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Detroit and New York.
Among those charged was a Mexican immigration official. 
 The authorities said the operators of the scheme charged their clients --from Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq, $10,000 to $25,000 a person to smuggle them from country to country until they reached their United States destinations.
The former Olympian, George Tajirian, had pleaded guilty to visa fraud in 1978 and served nine months on that charge.
Immigration officials said that three-quarters of the estimated 250 people that Mr. Tajirian's ring had brought into the United States in the last two years alone were from Iraq.
Breaking up immigrant smuggling schemes has become a priority of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, especially since 1993, when the grounding of the Golden Venture, a tramp steamer, off Rockaway Beach in Queens, with 300 illegal Chinese immigrants aboard, made the scale of these operations starkly evident.
Doris M. Meissner, Commissioner of the immigration service, said today's case was an example of how tougher laws and law enforcement have helped the authorities catch up with increasingly professional smugglers.
"We're tightening our law enforcement along the border and other places, and as a result, the smuggling networks are getting more sophisticated and dangerous," Mrs. Meissner said. "This is a very high priority, and this case is really a textbook example of how we're meeting the threat."
Mr. Tajirian, 56, now a Mexican citizen with homes in Mexico City and Quito, Ecuador, was apprehended by Panamanian officials on Feb. 13 and flown to Miami, where immigration agents arrested him, then took him to El Paso, officials said. He was charged with one count of conspiracy and six counts of alien smuggling in a scheme said in the indictment to have begun before January 1996 and lasted until his arrest. The charges carry a maximum sentence of 70 years.
Maria Soledad Martinez-Rangel, a Mexico City resident and Mr. Tajirian's wife; Salvador Moreno, the Mexican immigration agent, and Katia Anbousi, a Lebanese employee of Mr. Tajirian's Ecuadorean travel agency, were charged with single counts of conspiracy, carrying maximum sentences of five years.
None of the suspects have been arrested, but prosecutors are asking Mexican authorities to extradite their two residents.
Mrs. Meissner described today's indictments as a breakthrough in combating immigrant smuggling from the Middle East. It involved nine of her agency's offices, including three abroad that were added just in the last year, and an undercover agent who posed as a middle-man.
A leader of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee said, however, that today's indictment should not become an excuse for baseless accusations against those of Arab descent, who come primarily for economic opportunity.
"I would hope the I.N.S. would not look at them as terrorists because they are Arabs," said Houedia Saad, the group's legal director, regarding those who had been smuggled here.
Regional immigration officials said at a news conference here that the smugglers chose El Paso because it is the second-busiest point of entry, with 58 million crossings a year. Some were also smuggled across remote river crossings, officials said.
The latest case has roots dating to the Mexico City Olympics of 1968. During opening ceremonies, Mr. Tajirian carried the flag of Iraq's three-member Olympic team, but defected to Mexico instead of returning home. He bought a home in Detroit, which has a large community of fellow Iraqi Christians, but spent much of his time in Mexico.
Arrested in 1978 and charged with 15 counts of visa fraud, he pleaded to a single charge and cooperated with investigators. He said that several State Department officials in Mexico City introduced him to document forgery and immigrant smuggling, an accusation the State Department and the officials denied but immigration authorities confirmed.
Mr. Tajirian served a nine-month sentence, and Federal officials said today that they believed he resumed smuggling immigrants after his release, though the indictment concerns the last two years.
The investigation began in October 1996, when immigration authorities here say they found an immigrant, from Syria with false documents, and another, a Palestinian, falsely claiming American citizenship.
Investigators then traced travel patterns, payments and documents for them and four other illegal immigrants back to Mr. Tajirian, who they said had traveled the world to arrange immigrants' passage.
Only a few of the smuggled immigrants have been apprehended, and some have asked for political asylum. Immigration officials said their search for the other immigrants and their investigation would continue.

Bank Group Gives To Small Businesses

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO 

 BODY:
Twelve small businesses in the New York City metropolitan region have received $7.2 million from the New York Community Investment Company.
The companies, with annual sales ranging from less than $100,000 to more than $15 million, include a new medical center in the Bronx, an iron and steel products manufacturer in Brooklyn, a stock photo company in Manhattan and a wood products distributor on Staten Island. The majority of the businesses are owned by women or members of minority groups. 
 "The small-business community is the fastest-growing sector of New York City's economy, and its continued expansion and vitality is essential to the city's overall economic success," said Jill Considine, president of the New York Clearing House, a trade group, and chairman of the New York Community Investment Company.
That company, created by the New York Clearing House and its 10 member banks in 1995, provides equity and loans to small businesses in New York City. This year's activity was more than double the $3.5 million provided to four small businesses last year. NICK RAVO

HEADLINE: Covering Infertility Won't Hurt the Uninsured

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Even as a physician, I worked night shifts at a moonlighting job to pay for infertility treatments not covered by my employer-sponsored health plan (front page, Feb. 22). 
 You quote George J. Annas, chairman of the health law department at Boston University's School of Public Health, as saying that to mandate insurance coverage for infertility, "given the growing numbers of uninsured people, makes no legal, economic or health care sense." This suggests there is some link between the many people do not have access to basic health care and insurance coverage for infertility. There are no data to suggest that exclusion of insurance coverage for infertility has resulted in improved access to care for the underinsured or uninsured.
There is no reason to believe that inclusion of such coverage (at an estimated $3 per member a year) would lead to further loss of insurance coverage.

HEADLINE: CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK;
Cast Album Sampler: Broadway Changes Its Tune

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN 

 BODY:
What a jumble of contradictions! On one hand, two of the biggest hit musicals to open on Broadway in the last two years, "Titanic" and "Ragtime," are grand millennial pageants, resurrecting events and characters that date back nearly a hundred years. On the other, strong contemporary pop echoes run through these shows' period-flavored scores. As much as they look backward, both embrace an impersonal blockbuster mentality and pop-record esthetic that, like it or not, are revolutionizing the sound and substance of the Broadway musical.
Since middle-of-the-road pop, and various dilutions of rock, funk and world music have all but conquered Broadway, how could it be otherwise? Almost everyone under 50 grew up with rock-and-roll. To the baby-boom generation, the songwriters Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller, whose work is anthologized in the hit revue "Smokey Joe's Cafe," are as sacrosanct as George Gershwin is to their parents. Can Billy Joel and Bruce Springsteen revues be far behind? 
 There's no better way to explore the contradictory forces pulling at the Broadway musical than to listen to the cast albums of current and recent shows. Frank Wildhorn's two pop operettas, "Jekyll and Hyde" and "The Scarlet Pimpernel," glaringly illustrate this tug of war.
For better or worse, Mr. Wildhorn is America's answer to Andrew Lloyd Webber in the perpetuation of an antiquated form in an amplified pop format. As backward-looking as these flamboyantly acted and performed costume dramas appear, they also insist on the primacy of schmaltzy pop melodies and the contemporary lyric equivalents of "moon, June, spoon." Their ideal voices, instead of belonging to quirky theatrical personalities like Mary Martin or Ethel Merman, are impersonal pop technicians like Celine Dion and Peabo Bryson.
Mr. Wildhorn's ballad-heavy scores flaunt the same radio-ready values as the love songs from Disney musicals. When aimed at the rafters by powerful belters like Linda Eder (in "Jekyll and Hyde"), their official-sounding sentiments convey at least an illusion of emotional depth.
Mr. Lloyd Webber's loftier shows, especially " The Phantom of the Opera" and "Les Miserables," prepared the way. As Mr. Lloyd Webber shrewdly recognized, aggressive, semi-operatic declamation confers an aura of seriousness that has little to do with what's being sung.
In a Broadway musical-theater climate dominated at the moment by Mr. Lloyd Webber's long-running hits, Mr. Wildhorn's more recent ones and the accumulating Disney spectacles spun off from animated movies, with the looming possibility of future Garth Drabinsky-produced corporate spectacles like "Ragtime," what chances of survival, if any, does the traditional character-driven musical comedy have?
The popularity of City Center's Encores series of concert revivals of vintage musicals suggests that that tradition is not about to be trampled into oblivion, just pushed to the margins. At least in New York City, a ground swell of nostalgic appreciation for Broadway's musty musical treasures still exists.
Last season, the series initiated the hit revival of "Chicago," whose hard-shelled cynicism seems utterly contemporary even as its score parodies 1920's vaudeville styles. "Chicago" is one of five Encores productions -- including "Call Me Madam," "Out of This World," "The Boys From Syracuse" and "Pal Joey" -- whose cast albums have been recorded and whose chief pleasures include the chance to rediscover the subtle glories of pre-rock-era Broadway orchestrations, often lovingly reassembled from fragments.
In the meantime, shows like "Rent," "Side Show" and the dance-oriented revue "Bring In da Noise, Bring In da Funk" have proved that the ascendancy of the pop esthetic on Broadway need not preclude traditional storytelling and characters. Yet in many ways, the embattled relationship remains unresolved between Broadway, with its provincial Times Square traditions and attitudes, and the wider world of popular music, with its increasingly global perspective and its rapidly evolving electronic technology of sampling, synthesizing, amplifying and manipulating existing sound.
One of the most sobering lessons that Broadway has learned in the last three years is that it could not rely on the 1970's pop singer-songwriters to save the Broadway musical by moving into the theater when they matured, bringing a sophisticated baby-boom audience. Randy Newman's much-anticipated contemporary spoof of "Faust" never made it to Broadway. And "The Capeman," the $11 million Broadway debut of Paul Simon, was a critical disaster.
Both scores were conceived as song cycles before they were turned into music-theater works. And, in retrospect, the perils of moving from records into the theater should have been more obvious. That's not the way an organically coherent show is usually made. Almost always, it emerges from a messy collaborative storytelling process involving painful trial and error and ruthless editing. Where the singer-songwriter is essentially an introspective poet and commentator reflecting on the world, the Broadway musical is a gaudy, extroverted entertainment that demands vividness and larger-than-life action and, notwithstanding the intellectual games-playing of Stephen Sondheim (who at his best, also happens to be a master showman), has only a limited tolerance for subtlety, irony and the delicate play of ideas.
"The Capeman," whose cast album will be released by Dreamworks at the end of March, is essentially a staged oratorio whose score is a sustained, wistful meditation on youth and age and the possibility of redemption for one's youthful mistakes. It is much closer in spirit and aspiration to a Robert Wilson-Philip Glass opera than to a traditional Broadway show. Had it been marketed as a semi-experimental work and opened at the Next Wave Festival at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, it might have had quite a different reception from the cold shoulder it received on Broadway.
Perhaps the greatest artistic bonus of the pop explosion on Broadway has been the proliferation of powerful black and Hispanic singers on the stage. Brian Stokes Mitchell and Audra McDonald in "Ragtime"; Samuel E. Wright and Heather Headley in "The Lion King"; Norm Lewis in "Side Show"; almost everybody in "The Life," and Ednita Nazario and Marc Anthony in "The Capeman" are a few of the fine singers on a very long list.
Conflicting technological, economic and cultural forces may be tearing apart the very form and fabric of the Broadway musical. But at the same time, Broadway stages have never seen such a proliferation of powerful singers. Amid all the chaos, that's one reason for celebration.
Here is an alphabetical listing and consumer guide to recently released cast albums, including those for the Encores series. (Compact disks range in price from $15.98 to $17.98 for a single disk to $29.98 for a two-disk set.)
 
'The Boys From Syracuse'
Unlike "Pal Joey," which opened two years later, Rodgers and Hart's 1938 burlesque of Shakespeare's "Comedy of Errors" is strictly a period piece. But what a delightful and sexy bit of fluff it is!
The 1997 Encores recording features Hans Spialek's newly restored orchestrations, which are as twittery, twinkly and frilly as a maypole strung with bells, hearts and crepe-paper flowers. Rebecca Luker's rendition of "Falling in Love With Love," the score's best-known standard, is as giddily airy as springtime. Debbie Gravitte gives a bright, upbeat spin to the role of Luce, a wife who likes to put her husband to work (in bed). In the show's brightest moment, "Sing for Your Supper," she, Ms. Luker and Sarah Uriarte Berry advise women everywhere to discharge their conjugal duties with gusto. (Record label: DRG.)
 
'Call Me Madam'
The 1995 Encores cast recording of Irving Berlin's last major Broadway score, from 1950, is the only complete recording of the show ever made because of contractual difficulties involving its original star, Ethel Merman. Tyne Daly, who takes Merman's role as a brassy Washington party giver, may not have her forerunner's trumpetlike vocal blast, but she sashays through the role with confidence and style.
The score includes at least three Berlin gems: the salty, swaggering "Hostess With the Mostest on the Ball," "It's a Lovely Day Today" and "You're Just in Love," all done to lilting perfection thanks to Don Walker's original orchestrations, which are swinging and creamy in the manner of an ideal 1950's hotel dance band. (DRG.)
 
'Chicago: The Musical'
"These trials -- the whole world -- all show business," remarks a character in the 1975 John Kander-Fred Ebb-Bob Fosse musical "Chicago," which was triumphantly revived two years ago and whose vinegary humor pops and fizzes like fireworks off the cast album. This vaudeville show set in 1920's Chicago was well ahead of its time (the era of O. J. Simpson, Paula Corbin Jones and television tabloid journalism was years away) in recognizing that notoriety of any kind almost guarantees instant stardom. And its exquisitely crafted score may be the funniest, most incisive that Kander and Ebb ever wrote.
Bebe Neuwirth and Ann Reinking's comic caricatures of leggy Jazz Age murderers with big show-biz dreams match the high-stepping pep of the vaudeville pastiche songs, which are almost the equal of vintage Brecht-Weill, buoyantly animated by Rob Fisher leading a superb vaudeville jazz band. When Ms. Neuwirth and Marcia Lewis, as a power-brokering prison matron, lament, "Whatever happened to class?," you sympathize with their sense of loss. (RCA Victor.)
 
'Jekyll and Hyde'
The Frank Wildhorn-Leslie Bricusse operetta sounds noticeably fuller on disk than in the theater, thanks to a glitzy pop production that treats the score's many ballads as echo-heavy, radio-ready tear-jerkers drenched in strings. An Anglophile with a retentive ear for romantic pop hooks, Mr. Wildhorn's generic melodies fuse the pomp of Mr. Lloyd Webber in his "Phantom of the Opera" mode with the hamminess of Anthony Newley (a onetime Bricusse collaborator) and a dollop of David Gates. "A New Life" is virtually lifted from the 1977 Bread hit "Lost Without Your Love."
The tunes are raw meat for the show's belters, Linda Eder, a younger Barbra Streisand with a similar sob, and Colm Wilkinson, a semi-operatic British ham, who tear into them like ravenous tigers. Beneath the glitz, the music is treacly and superficially histronic. By Act 2, the metaphorical comparison between Dr. Jekyll's experiments and contemporary crack addiction has been beaten to death.
The album is available in both a complete two-disk version (Atlantic Records) and a one-disk "highlights" (RCA Victor).
 
'The Life'
For this sentimentalized look at prostitution in Times Square in the early 80's, Cy Coleman has composed one of his most melodic scores in a style that suggests a thinly diluted "Porgy and Bess" blended with bleached-out Curtis Mayfield and Isaac Hayes to create a mood of torchy sleaze. Ira Gasman's flat-footed lyrics wallow in shopworn sentiments like "He's no good but I'm no good without him," and the show's climactic ballad is a clunker, seriously titled "We Had a Dream." It all makes for the theatrical equivalent of a nonthreatening PG-rated theme park remembering the bad old days of Times Square.
As stale and secondhand as much of it is, "The Life" is consistently tuneful, and the performers -- Pamela Isaacs, Kevin Ramsey, Lillias White and especially Chuck Cooper as a sinister pimp named Memphis -- pour enough angry, sorrowful energy into the material to pump it full of dramatic life. (Sony Classical.)
 
'The Lion King'
It isn't just Julie Taymor's astounding puppet designs, costumes and masks that have transformed "The Lion King" from a likable animated movie with a cheery inspirational message into a breathtaking music-theater ritual. The film's original songs by Elton John and Tim Rice have been enriched, augmented and ultimately superseded by new African-flavored pop songs and chants in Zulu and other African dialects, composed by Lebo M and Mark Mancina and spaciously arranged by Hans Zimmer.
The added material gives the fable a genuine emotional depth, with three significant new ballads serving as potent vocal showcases: "They Live in You," magnificently sung by Samuel E. Wright as Mustafa; "Shadowland," sung achingly by Heather Headley as Nada, and "Endless Night," with Jason Raize as the grown-up Simba. With the exception of "Can You Feel the Love Tonight?" most of the John-Rice numbers are comic relief.
If the disparity between the African-inflected material and the duo's watered-down Gilbert and Sullivan (Mr. John and Mr. Rice have each done far stronger work with other collaborators) robs "The Lion King" of stylistic consistency, the juxtaposition represents corporate pop calculation at its shrewdest. (Walt Disney Records.)
 
'Out of This World'
Because it arrived on Broadway when Rodgers and Hammerstein's more serious shows were the standard-bearers for the musical theater, Cole Porter's gleefully frivolous 1950 show, "Out of This World," was not a commercial success. But this blithely salacious reworking of the Amphitryon legend, which the Encores series revived in 1995, finds Porter at the pinnacle of his genius.
While the score's best-known numbers are "Use Your Imagination" and "From This Moment On," which was dropped from the original Broadway production, they are outshone by such dazzling comic gems as "I Got Beauty," "What Do You Think About Men?," "I Sleep Easier Now," the hilarious pseudo-gospel travesty "Climb Up the Mountain," and "Nobody's Chasing Me." These songs abound in worldly-wise bon mots about sex, aging and male mating instincts, most coming from the mouth of Andrea Martin as a resilient, wisecracking Juno waiting for her Jupiter to return to the nest. (DRG.)
 
'Pal Joey'
Although it has its antique elements, this 1940 Rodgers and Hart show is really Broadway's first "urban-contemporary" musical. And the 1995 Encores cast album is notable for restoring the original, bubbly Hans Spialek orchestrations that were scrapped for tougher, more streamlined arrangements in later revivals.
Singing a title role originated by Gene Kelly and later performed memorably by Harold Lang, Peter Gallagher fails to convey Joey's avidity and rakish charm. But Patti LuPone as his clinging older paramour, Vera Simpson, has a much earthier sound than Vivienne Segal, who first played the role. Her "Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered," although a bit overeager, smolders with carnal knowingness. (DRG.)
 
'Ragtime'
Since making their Broadway debut with "Once on This Island," the songwriting team of Stephen Flaherty (music) and Lynn Ahrens (lyrics) have shown impressive skill at fusing traditional Broadway tunefulness with soaring middle-of-the-road pop. The score for "Ragtime" is certainly their finest to date, but in its calculation, impersonality and reaching for sure-fire crescendos, it is as unnerving as the late official-sounding ballads of Rodgers and Hammerstein.
In their inflections, the biggest numbers seem consciously to echo "Show Boat" ("The Wings of a Dream" is an upbeat "Ol' Man River" filtered through "The Wind Beneath My Wings") and "Porgy and Bess" ("Your Daddy's Son"). The cast's sturdy voices and rich choral singing go a long way toward redeeming blunt declarative lyrics from sentimentality.
Brian Stokes Mitchell brings heroic weight and depth to the central role of the black revolutionary Coalhouse Walker Jr. The score is seamlessly threaded with bright tuneful ragtime numbers and pastiches of other early-20th-century American styles. William David Brohn's scintillating orchestrations, in which the instruments often reinforce the vocal lines, have a high Hollywood gloss that matches the material. ("Songs From 'Ragtime' the Musical" is on the RCA Victor label; the label will also release a two-disk set of the Broadway cast recording on April 28.)
 
'The Scarlet Pimpernel'
In the album liner notes to this corny romantic swashbuckler set during the French Revolution, the show's director, Peter Hunt, declares, "The real revolution is being led by Frank Wildhorn as he battles to return 'popular' or pop music to the theater." If popular means numbing melodic cliches recycled one more time, then the composer has won his battle.
As in "Jekyll and Hyde," every other song is a trite declamatory vocal showpiece with makeshift lyrics (this time by Nan Knighton). One song, "You Are My Home," has already been a hit duet for Linda Eder and Peabo Bryson.
Some gallumphing French waltzes, a hoity-toity number with harpsichord and a couple of pumped-up marches supply a generalized period flavor and sense of nationality. Christine Andreas as Marguerite has a lovely voice but affects a vague French accent that adds unnecessary tension to her singing. Not just the songs, but the cast album's production and performances are a cut below those of "Jekyll and Hyde." (Atlantic.)
 
'1776'
Imagine America's Founding Fathers as a bunch of comedians trying to upstage each other at a Friars Club roast while arguing about the Declaration of Independence, and you have the essence of "1776," the 1969 show revived by the Roundabout Theater Company. The biggest ham of all in this production is Pat Hingle's blustering, avuncular Benjamin Franklin.
If the music in Sherman Edwards's score wanders all over the place (broadly parodying everything from period marches to minuets, all filtered through Gilbert and Sullivan), his lyrics burst with humor and zany rhymes: extemporanea, mania and Pennsylvania. The score falls flat in its sentimental interludes and hits a low point with the obligatory (for 1969) antiwar dirge "Momma Look Sharp." But if you listen through all the shouting and shtick, the show offers a lively and instructive history lesson. (TVT Soundtrax.)
 
'Side Show'
The story of Daisy and Violet Hilton, Siamese twins who rose from the circus to vaudeville stardom, has been dramatized with real passion by Henry Krieger, the composer of "Dreamgirls," and his lyric collaborator, Bill Russell. Working from a solid 1960's New York pop base, Mr. Krieger's score, with its meat-and-potatoes melodies elongated into open-ended theatrical arias, surges with the same yearning spirit that infused his score for "Dreamgirls," and Mr. Russell's direct, cliche-free lyrics illuminate characters who in one way or another are all outsiders longing for acceptance.
"Like Everyone Else," "Who Will Love Me As I Am?" and "You Should Be Loved" (sung with a devastating intensity by Norm Lewis), and the twins' final ballad, "I Will Never Leave You," capture elemental human drives with a blunt, forceful emotion. And the period vaudeville pastiche songs find Mr. Krieger moving confidently beyond his usual compositional turf. Even more than "Dreamgirls," "Side Show" offers an encouraging musical object lesson in pop-Broadway fusion. (Sony Classical.)
 
'Smokey Joe's Cafe'
 
Never underestimate the box office power of rock-and-roll nostalgia merchandised under a catchy title. The music on the two-disk album of the revue, consisting of 40 wonderful, mostly familiar songs by Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller, sounds better here than in the theater, but that isn't saying much. Most of these mechanical renditions of hits for the Coasters, Elvis Presley, the Drifters and many others are empty travesties lacking the idiomatic sass and soulfulness of the original versions. (Atlantic.)
 
'Steel Pier'
John Kander and Fred Ebb's score for this short-lived Broadway musical set in 1933 at an Atlantic City dance marathon is workmanlike and peppy but lacks depth and verbal wit. You can hear the team panting desperately to evoke their past triumphs in the title song, an inferior echo of "Cabaret" that urges, "Life's a party/Why don't you come to the steel pier?" And "Everybody's Girl," Debra Monk's comic ode to promiscuity, is a thudding embarrassment.
But if most of Mr. Ebb's lyrics have a paint-by-numbers predictability, Mr. Kander's period melodies have a bouncy charm that is enhanced by Michael Gibson's buoyant swing orchestrations. Sadly, the show's main attraction, Karen Ziemba's dancing, couldn't be captured on a record. (RCA Victor.)
 
'Titanic'
Why should the music in a show depicting this century's ultimate maritime disaster be so essentially wan? This is not to say that Maury Yeston's songs for "Titanic" aren't well-made. In imagining shipboard life in 1912, Mr. Yeston has written a suite of subtle, gently melodic pastiche songs that echo everything from the stately hymnlike music of Edward Elgar to Gilbert and Sullivan (the sprightly "What a Remarkable Age This Is!") to gossamer period waltzes ("No Moon," "Autumn") to pre-Jazz Age rags ("Doing the Latest Rag") to turn-of-the-century sentimental ballads ("Still").
The songs are cleverly constructed to accommodate elaborate explanatory dialogue and multiple voices. Jonathan Tunick's orchestrations maintain a delicate balance between Broadway and classical influences.
But the result is a skillfully drawn panorama in which the drama remains muted, characters are vague, and no song is especially memorable. (RCA Victor.)
 
'When Pigs Fly'
When the campy topical humor in this rinky-dink Off Broadway revue lands, there's nothing funnier to be heard on or Off Broadway. Among the wittiest songs in a show celebrating gay pride with a wink and a smile are its stingingly funny mock torch songs crooned to the conservative icons Newt Gingrich, Strom Thurmond and Rush Limbaugh. A sample couplet, directed to Mr. Gingrich: "In my permanent Oz you are my wizard/Your mother took one look and named you after a lizard."
These and other numbers, all with lyrics by Mark Waldrop (Dick Gallagher wrote the music), are descendants of Cole Porter's cheeky topical name-dropping show tunes from an earlier era, filtered through "Forbidden Broadway." While the cast album for "Howard Crabtree's 'When Pigs Fly' " can't recreate the show's fantastically funny and inventive costumes, designed by Mr. Crabtree, who died before the show opened, it successfully conveys the antic gay-boys-rummaging-through-the-attic spirit in which they're worn. (RCA Victor.)

J. P. Morgan In Korea Battle On Derivatives

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN 

 BODY:
Derivatives, the complex financial products that have won the hearts of corporations trying to limit business risks and of speculators trying to make a fast buck, are causing headaches in Asia and forcing regulators in the United States to discreetly inquire about any bombshells on the books of banks here.
The value of derivatives is pegged to that of underlying assets, such as stocks, bonds and currencies. But when two parties agree to take opposite sides in a derivatives deal, the prospects that the loser will pay the winner is only as good as the paper on which their contract is written and the integrity of the participants. 
Derivatives are loosely regulated, do not trade on public exchanges and, in disputes, ultimately have to be enforced in court.
Now, J. P. Morgan & Company, one of the nation's most prestigious banks, is embroiled in such a rancorous dispute over derivatives deals with South Korean companies that have exposed it to hundreds of millions of dollars in potential losses.
And because Morgan is not the only American bank involved in such risky trading in Asia, the Federal Reserve and other regulators are scrutinizing banks' exposure to losses there, according to banks that have been contacted recently.
The Fed declined yesterday to comment on the matter.
Morgan's dispute is the subject of a tangled lawsuit the bank filed that is starting to wend its way through United States District Court in Manhattan. In the latest twist, the Housing and Commercial Bank, one of South Korea's largest and a defendant in the suit, is crying foul.
Housing and Commercial guaranteed the SK Securities Company, a Korean investment firm and the other defendant in the suit, against losses in two derivatives contracts between SK and Morgan. In interviews over the last two days, lawyers for Housing and Commercial said the contracts originally specified that the losses would not exceed $100 million.
But the Housing and Commercial lawyers, led by Robert A. Weiner of the firm of McDermott, Will & Emery of New York, contend that language in the contracts was altered without the bank's knowledge -- in such a way that SK's potential losses, and Morgan's potential gains, were not limited to $100 million.
The lawyers say they are uncertain who might be responsible for such changes and do not know whether they were simply a matter of negligence or involved deliberate machinations.
For its part, Morgan says it is owed $300 million by Housing and Commercial and SK, and that the South Korean companies, which have refused to pay the full amount, have violated the contracts. Morgan stands to lose a substantial, though undetermined, amount on the contracts if they remain unpaid.
Frederick A. O. Schwarz Jr. of the law firm of Cravath, Swaine & Moore, representing Morgan, says that the final contracts governing the derivatives did not contain language limiting losses to $100 million. Moreover, Morgan says that Housing and Commercial's general counsel, David Yu, said that an officer of his bank authorized the removal of the $100 million limit before the contract closing. Mr. Yu could not be reached for comment.
An SK spokesman declined to comment other than to say that "there are misrepresentations and irregularities in the transaction, and Morgan should be held accountable for them."
But more is at stake in the dispute than the terms of the contracts. Since the dispute became public, Morgan has emphasized the threats posed to Asian financial markets if investors lose confidence in the integrity of derivatives contracts there. But many other participants in the derivatives market say this is not their main concern. These people say their greater worry is that the dispute will result in more rigorous regulatory oversight of the innovative -- and freewheeling -- derivatives market.
"It has always been the derivatives industry's fear that regulators will make the rules, rather than the participants," said Leslie Rahl, a principal with Capital Markets Risk Advisers, a New York consulting firm specializing in derivatives. "Any time there is litigation, you have to wonder how things will get resolved. This has the feeling of the tip of the iceberg in Southeast Asia."
Indeed, so loath are commercial and investment banks to invite regulatory scrutiny of their derivatives activities that almost all legal disputes about such contracts have been settled before going to trial.
Another issue vexing the derivatives market is how often the products are used to hedge risks, such as unforeseen shifts in foreign-exchange or interest rates, and how often they are used merely as a high-octane form of gambling. The Morgan dispute clearly involves the latter.
According to court papers, Morgan and SK agreed in February 1997 to enter into two complex derivatives contracts involving currency swaps. A currency swap occurs when two parties sell each other currencies and agree to re-exchange the principal at a later date. SK, betting that the Thai baht would rise, exchanged Japanese yen with Morgan in return for baht.
SK and Morgan had a close working arrangement. SK had established offshore funds to manage the derivatives, and those funds also purchased other securities directly from Morgan. But when the baht crashed last summer, setting the Asian economic crisis in motion, SK's big bet on the baht proved to be a key part of a $300 million blunder. So did other currency plays that SK had incorrectly wagered on. SK had a third derivatives contract with Morgan that has left it with a $189 million loss and is the subject of a separate court action in South Korea.
All told, SK and its guarantors have a potential liability to Morgan of $489 million, thus accounting for the bulk of $587 million in currency swaps Morgan recently designated as nonperforming.
SK has contended in papers filed in the Korean court action, that Morgan failed to adequately inform it about the risks inherent in the derivatives contracts. When SK filed a similar claim against Morgan in New York two weeks ago, the judge derided the firm's argument and SK withdrew the claim.
While Morgan now questions SK's reputability in court papers, that apparently was not a concern when the derivatives contracts were arranged.
Morgan tried, unsuccessfully, to have derivatives included in ongoing international debt renegotiations with South Korea.
As part of the renegotiation process, the South Korean Government and major banks are to begin a campaign today to persuade scores of international banks to sign on to a plan aimed at repackaging $24 billion in Korean debt coming due by March 31. The effort begins in Tokyo and continues next week in New York, Paris, Frankfurt and London.
Although commercial bankers say that they expect some resistance from smaller international banks, which are not interested in signing on to the plan, they are optimistic that enough of the short-term debt will be converted into longer-term debt to make the effort successful.
The South Korean Government recently selected Goldman, Sachs & Company and Salomon Smith Barney to lead a $9 billion bond offering that the Government expects to get under way once the debt repackaging is completed.
 

CORRECTION-DATE: March 17, 1998, Tuesday

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Feb. 27 described a lawsuit in which J. P. Morgan & Company is suing several South Korean companies over contracts involving the complex financial products known as derivatives.
The article quoted Leslie Rahl, a principal of Capital Markets Risk Advisers, a New York consulting firm, as saying that litigation of cases involving derivatives often causes the industry to worry that regulatory scrutiny will be heightened.
The article described Ms. Rahl as a participant in the derivatives market. But it did not note that she is a consultant for a law firm representing Housing and Commercial Bank, one of the South Korean defendants in the Morgan suit, and thus might have an interest in a negotiated settlement of the dispute. The article should not have quoted her without mentioning that affiliation, which was pointed out in a March 3 letter from Morgan to The Times.

30-Year Yield Rises Over 6%, But Then Falls

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices rebounded smartly from early losses to end higher yesterday.
The afternoon rally came on bargain hunting when the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond rose above 6 percent for the first time in nearly three months. Bonds were also supported by short-covering and by signs that the Federal Reserve was buying securities. 
 The price of the 30-year bond rose 9/32, to 102 27/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.92 percent, from 5.94 percent on Thursday and off the morning high of 6.1 percent.
In early trading, prices on the long end of the market underperformed the short end as investors sold over concern that the strong economy might not be slowed much by the weakness in Asia. These concerns had been heightened by comments earlier in the week by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman. Mr. Greenspan told the House Banking Committee on Tuesday that "events in the months ahead are not likely to unfold smoothly," especially given Asia's troubles.
Data released yesterday showing strong manufacturing and economic growth also worried investors.
The Purchasing Management Association of Chicago said yesterday that its index of regional business activity rose to 57.8 in February from 57.7 percent in January -- and above analysts' expectations of a decline to 56.8.
The Commerce Department, meanwhile, said that the economy grew at a revised rate of 3.9 percent in the fourth quarter of last year, down from its initial estimate of 4.3 percent, but higher than analysts' expectations that the revision would be 3.7 percent.
"Today's low bond yields are based on rosy expectations," said Larry Wipf, senior economist at the Norwest Corporation in Minneapolis. "With stable short-term interest rates, bond yields are likely to edge up, steepening the yield curve."
A large amount of data await the market next week, beginning with Monday's release of January consumer spending and the February National Association of Purchasing Management index, and winding up on Friday with the February jobless report.
The February unemployment report is expected to show a 250,000 gain in nonfarm payrolls.

HEADLINE: Asia and the Dollar

 BODY:

To the Editor:
In "Asia May Pinch Us Yet" (Op-Ed, Feb. 24), Stephen S. Roach postulates that an expanding trade deficit with Asia will lead to "an ever-expanding" supply of American assets and eventually to the supply-demand adjustments of a falling dollar or rising interest rates. 
 But foreign trade does not increase the United States money supply or Treasury debt. That is done by the American banking system and Government. If we keep the economy -- and money supply -- from expanding too rapidly, and keep Government expenditures in line with receipts, there will not be a problem with the dollar supply or Treasury debt outstripping demand, no matter who holds them.

HEADLINE: 4th-Quarter Economic Growth Is Revised to 3.9% From 4.3%

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 27

 BODY:
The economy grew at a slower pace in the fourth quarter than first estimated but still posted its best annual growth in nearly a decade, while inflation remained tame, the Government said today.
 Gross domestic product, the broadest measure of the economy, grew at a 3.9 percent rate in the quarter, down from the 4.3 percent pace estimated a month ago, the Commerce Department said. 
 Analysts said that since imports rose faster and exports grew more slowly in the quarter than previously thought, the revision contained hints that Asia's problems were slowing United States growth.
Asia's economic crisis is expected to curb American exports to the region while generating cheaper imports to the United States.
Despite the revision, G.D.P. growth was unchanged at 3.8 percent for all of 1997 -- the strongest since a matching 3.8 percent in 1988.
In addition to a rise in imports and lower exports, the department attributed the revision to a drop in government spending in the quarter.
Inflation was also quieter than first thought. Two key measures of price changes each rose at a 1.4 percent rate in the quarter, down from 1.5 percent reported last month. Economists had expected both measures to jump to 2 percent.
Consumer confidence remains high. The University of Michigan's index of consumer sentiment for February rose to 110.4 from 106.6 in January, said people who saw the report, released only to subscribers.
Growth is expected to slow this year in part because Asia will buy less from American exporters. "There is certainly a hint of the Asia crisis in the quarterly numbers," said David Berson, chief economist of the Federal National Mortgage Association.
The department said imports rose at a 6.4 percent rate in the fourth quarter, up from the 1.3 percent initially estimated. It was not clear how much of the increase came from Asia. Exports grew more slowly in the quarter, at a 10 percent rate, down from last month's estimate of 11.3 percent.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Dow Closes Above 8,500 As Blue-Chip Issues Rally

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
The stock market continued to rally yesterday, setting yet another record in a year that many Wall Street experts had expected to be a troublesome one.
 Blue-chip issues led the way, sending the Dow Jones industrial average up 55.05 points, or seven-tenths of 1 percent, to a record 8,545.72. It was the first time the Dow closed above the 8,500 level. 
 With that jump, the Dow ended February with a gain of 639 points, or 8.1 percent, its best monthly total since November 1996, when the index gained 8.2 percent, and its second- strongest month in six years.
While the Asian economic crisis had depressed stocks late last year, fears over the impact of that turmoil have eased, bolstering stocks around the world, and leading to a sharp run-up in the United States.
Through much of February, the Dow and other market measures have climbed, notching record-after-record highs on heavy volume, even though corporate profits have slowed some since last summer.
Yesterday, for instance, although the Standard & Poor's index rose modestly, gaining 0.67 point, to 1,049.34, the index set its 13th record high this month. The S.& P. 500 rose 7 percent in February.
The Nasdaq composite index, heavy with technology stocks, fell modestly yesterday, dropping 6.60 points, to 1,770.51. But for the month, the Nasdaq outpaced all the major stock indexes on the strength of a bullish technology sector, soaring 9.3 percent in February.
Wall Street experts, who call this a "sigh of relief" rally, continue to express awe at a market that after three years of blockbuster 20 percent gains, is again rocketing higher.
"There is no law of gravity when it comes to our stock market," said Robert F. Dickey, a technical analyst at Dain Rauscher in Minneapolis. "Investors have resigned themselves to the fact that the market is just going to continue to go up."
Although Asia continues to pose a threat, the United States economy remains healthy, with little signs of inflation. Yesterday, for instance, the Government confirmed that last year the United States economy grew at its fastest pace in nearly a decade, with the gross domestic product rising 3.8 percent.
That news came on the same day that the Congressional Budget Office revised its forecast for 1998, saying that it expected the Government to post its first budget surplus in 30 years. And Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin said in an interview with Bloomberg News that he expected interest rates to fall even further.
Yesterday, the benchmark 30-year Treasury closed at 5.92 percent -- it has held relatively steady in the last three months.
Those details add up to a nearly euphoric picture for many investors, analysts say. There are even some hints that strong growth in Europe will help offset part of the slowdown in Asia.
"Investors are sending the message that the American economy may suffer an Asia-induced soft-landing," said Hugh Johnson, a market strategist at the First Albany Corporation. "But investors have looked beyond that slowdown. They're looking over the valley, to a time when the economy is going to resume a more normal recovery."
But Mr. Dickey at Dain Rauscher and other analysts remain cautious.
Mr. Dickey said that his technical indicators, such as the number of stocks that fall versus the number that rise, have been weakening in recent days, suggesting a slowdown.
But stock prices have rested relatively little in the last decade. "There are all kinds of warning flags flying around this market," he said, "and bears like me are getting tired of waiting for the other shoe to drop."

HEADLINE: American With Cure-All Enlivens Jakarta Crisis

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia, Feb. 27

 BODY:
President Suharto was desperate. His country's economy was sinking fast, the currency and stock market had plummeted, and food shortages were causing riots. Nothing he tried was working.
Enter a little-known American economist with a cure-all to instantly restore prosperity. "The day you put it in, everybody will be richer, just like that," declared the economist, Steve H. Hanke, a professor at Johns Hopkins University. 
 Mr. Suharto was delighted. The rich and powerful were pleased. Financial markets rallied.
But President Clinton, the Governments of Germany, Japan and Singapore, the International Monetary Fund, which had just fashioned a $43 billion bailout for Indonesia, and leading economists were horrified.
Mr. Hanke's plan involved fixing the exchange rate of the battered Indonesian currency to the dollar. It is an idea rooted in the 19th century that has worked recently in smaller countries like Bulgaria, Lithuania and Argentina.
But critics said it would not work in the world's fourth most populous country. Indonesia's banking system needs a major overhaul, the thinking goes, and a monetary policy that essentially runs on automatic pilot might only make matters worse. Indeed, the I.M.F. threatened to cut off its aid. Mr. Clinton telephoned Mr. Suharto, urging him not to do it and is sending Walter F. Mondale to meet with Mr. Suharto next week.
For now it looks as if the idea has been shelved. But what unfolded here at the epicenter of Asia's crisis was an extraordinary two-week drama: Professor Hanke versus the world.
As much as the White House thought it was a time-wasting distraction, the professor appeared to be loving it. From the television interviews to the front-page headlines to the audiences with Mr. Suharto, Mr. Hanke, 55, was the man of the moment.
"He likes combat," said Louis Galambos, a history professor who with Mr. Hanke heads the university's Institute for Applied Economics and the Study of Business Enterprise. "He likes a good fight. He doesn't mind it at all."
Indeed, this could be a case study for a course Mr. Hanke calls "controversies in applied economics."
Applied economics is an apt description for Mr. Hanke's approach. In addition to offering tart, conservative prescriptions in a monthly column in Forbes magazine, he is an officer of a well-regarded Canadian money-management company that has profited recently by betting against Asia's falling currencies -- including the Indonesian rupiah.
And so, the other day, Mr. Hanke stared out over his half-glasses at a roomful of skeptical reporters and announced: "The press gets this wrong all the time. The problem is, the press talks to economists, and the economists always get this wrong."
Right or wrong, the economists and the foreign governments have gotten the upper hand. Although Indonesian officials say the plan is not yet dead, the tide has turned against the professor. A face-saving formula has emerged in which plans for a board may proceed, but putting the project into effect may be put off indefinitely.
Such a delay would be a defeat for Mr. Hanke. "You've got to do it now," he insisted shortly after he arrived. "You can't fool around with all these hypotheticals. If you don't put it in, the currency collapses and all of Asia blows up."
With the flick of a switch, the idea goes, the wildly undervalued rupiah would surge, companies could begin paying off their billions of dollars in foreign debt, and Indonesia's economy would begin stirring again.
"There has never been a failure of a currency board anywhere in the world," Mr. Hanke told television viewers in a long interview that was broadcast repeatedly on a station owned by one of the President's sons. "These are tough systems, and when I say they are foolproof, that's exactly the case."
Few other economists agree with that.
"He might be seen as being a little enthusiastic about the idea that these things could work anywhere," said Steven Radelet, an economist who is an expert on Indonesia at the Harvard Institute for International Development.
"Our concern is that it just wouldn't work in Indonesia, or that the odds of its working would be very slim," he said. "Indonesia really doesn't have the characteristics that one would look for when they think of a currency board."
The fear is that unless a reorganization of the banking system is accomplished beforehand, and the country's foreign debt load is reduced, a currency board could lead to a full-scale economic collapse.
With a stronger rupiah, the critics say, there would be an immediate rush to dump the currency for dollars, and interest rates would soar as the rupiah supply shrank. Borrowers would have trouble paying such high interest rates, and banks might fail.
In the television interview, Mr. Hanke had little patience for these concerns but did not fully explain himself. "The I.M.F. always gets it wrong," he said, just as do the reporters, economists and anybody else who disagrees with him. "President Suharto understands this perfectly well."
But it is not clear how thoroughly Mr. Hanke has described his ideas. Speaking to an Indonesian business group, for instance, he surprised them with the assertion, "I have an elegant solution to the debt problem, which can be taken care of in a week." Then, as the businessmen waited expectantly for more, the professor added, "Assume the problem has been solved."
As missionary of the fixed exchange rate, Mr. Hanke says he has promoted currency boards to the Governments of Lithuania, Estonia, Bosnia, Bulgaria and Argentina. As he describes it, it did not take much for his pitch to work in Lithuania.
"In 1994 Mrs. Hanke and I went out to Vilnius, Lithuania, and it was precisely like the situation here," he said. "The Prime Minister asked us to come have lunch with him. He wanted to talk about currency reform and stability in Lithuania, and about half way through the lunch he said, 'Fine. We're going to do it.' Three weeks later it was installed and running."
In Argentina, Mr. Hanke says he was an adviser to the Government, which created its board in 1991. Domingo Cavallo, who was that country's Finance Minister at the time, said this week that Mr. Hanke's role was essentially as a publicist for the board.
"In 1994, three years after the currency board was in place, he came to me in the ministry, and he offered to help us explain abroad, how does a currency board work," Mr. Cavallo said. "That was his involvement, that is, explaining abroad the way our monetary system was working. He was not involved in the launching of the currency board."
What puzzles Washington, and is still something of a mystery here, is how Mr. Hanke met Mr. Suharto -- without the knowledge of the Finance Ministry or of the I.M.F.
Indonesian officials and outside experts say he was brought to the President by Mr. Suharto's children, who have vast business interests here and who are resisting the tough measures imposed by the I.M.F. and Indonesia's central bank.
But Simon E. Nocera, a former senior official with the I.M.F. and now the chief investment officer with CapMAC Investment Management in San Francisco, said it was he who brought attention to Mr. Hanke through a prominent Indonesian businessman named Peter F. Gontha.
Mr. Nocera said he came to Indonesia last month, like many other economists, to offer advice to the Government and among other things showed them a paper on currency boards written by Mr. Hanke. The next thing he knew, Mr. Hanke was here, and was whisked in to see the President.
Besides teaching, Mr. Hanke is vice chairman of the New York subsidiary of the Friedberg Mercantile Group, a Toronto-based money management concern that primarily trades commodities futures and currencies for wealthy clients. The potential conflict between advising governments on their fiscal policies and betting on their currencies is frowned upon by some experts, but they say the practice is neither illegal nor uncommon. The professor is not involved in active trading, but he calls on clients, consults on strategy and writes for Friedberg's newsletter.
Friedberg makes no secret that it has been speculating on a decline in the rupiah -- along with several other Asian currencies -- an activity that Mr. Suharto recently condemned.
And the company is quite pleased with the results. In its Internet report on the last three months of 1997, it announced, "It was a far better quarter than we had ever imagined it would be."

Proposed Euro Currency Overcomes Crucial Hurdle
The euro, the single European currency planned for introduction in less than a year, has moved much closer to reality on news that all participating countries have proved their commitment to fiscal austerity in official 1997 economic results. 
 Germany, France and Italy, the most important euro participants, all showed that they had significantly lowered budget deficits and inflation rates to limits well within the euro plan. Other participants reported similar results earlier in the week, all but assuring that 11 European nations will surrender their own currencies in favor of the single currency as scheduled. Such a prospect was considered highly unlikely not long ago. Page A1.
 
ARCO in Deal to Sell Coal Business
Atlantic Richfield announced a preliminary agreement to sell its large coal business in the United States to a unit of Beacon Group, a New York investment firm, which would become the second-biggest coal operator in the country. Terms were not disclosed, but ARCO, which put the business up for sale last year, is said to have sought about $1.6 billion. D2.
 
Asia Impact Seen in Slower G.D.P.
The economy grew at a 3.9 percent rate in the fourth quarter, down from the 4.3 percent estimated a month ago. Economists said the the Commerce Department report contained hints that Asia's economic crisis had started to slow United States growth in the last three months of the year. Even so, the economy grew at a 3.8 percent rate for all of 1997, its best rate in nearly a decade. D3.
 
Stocks Roar Into March
After a worrisome January that suggested the bull market had stalled, stocks recorded the best performance in 15 months in February. In the latest sign of what Wall Street analysts are calling the "sigh of relief" rally, the Dow Jones industrial average set another record yesterday, with a 55.05-point gain that pushed the average to 8,545.72. For the month, the Dow gained 639 points, or 8.1 percent. D3.
 
Treasuries rallied from an early decline, helped by bargain-hunting and signs that the Federal Reserve was buying. The 30-year bond yield fell to 5.92 percent from 5.94. D3.
 
Pulitzer May Sell Broadcast Unit
Shares of Pulitzer Publishing jumped 24 percent after the company said that it might sell its broadcasting division. Industry analysts said the unit could fetch more than $1 billion. The stock rose $16.375, to $84. D3.
 
Apple's Newton Cut Further
Apple said it would quit making Newton software and products to focus on its Macintosh operating system. Apple has been cutting jobs at the once-promising Newton unit, which has been losing money because of increased competition in the palmtop computing market. D3.
 
Possible Hostile Bid for SmithKline
Shares of SmithKline Beecham jumped briefly on reports in British newspapers that Glaxo Wellcome might make a hostile bid for the company following the collapse earlier in the week of discussions that had been expected to result in the biggest corporate merger. Both companies declined to comment on the reports. SmithKline's American depository receipts rose 93.75 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $61.875. D2.
 
Suharto's Obscure American Friend
For a few weeks in February, Indonesia's economic crisis threw the spotlight on Steve H. Hanke, a little-known economist at Johns Hopkins University who said he had a cure-all that would raise the value of the country's currency. The idea was enough to enchant a desperate President Suharto, who adopted the economist as a close adviser and nearly followed his advice before the world's financial superpowers pressured the Indonesian leader to shelve Mr. Hanke's currency plan.

HEADLINE: Jones Fund Is Not for Lawyers, Group Underwriting Suit Says

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 27

 BODY:
The institute underwriting Paula Corbin Jones's sexual misconduct lawsuit against President Clinton said today that another legal defense fund controlled by Ms. Jones herself had not been earmarking its donations for her lawyers.
"We're not getting that money," John W. Whitehead, president of the Rutherford Institute, said when asked about Ms. Jones's own fund. 
 Mr. Clinton's defense lawyers have charged that the fund is being used by Ms. Jones for personal enrichment, not legal costs.
"I've seen the fund's pieces of advertising implying the money is being used to pay lawyers' expenses, and that's not true," said Mr. Whitehead. His Virginia institute, which specializes in conservative legal cases, is paying the expenses of Ms. Jones's 20-member legal team and seeking public donations for the case.
"I think they know of our concern," said Mr. Whitehead of the administrators of Ms. Jones's fund, although he declined to say whether he had complained to Ms. Jones herself. He said that fund raising had "not been great."
Ms. Jones's spokeswoman, Susan Carpenter-McMillan, said the President's defenders were trying to divide the Jones team by raising the fund-raising question.
"Every single dime" has been properly used for Ms. Jones's separate expenses in the lawsuit, Ms. Carpenter-McMillan said.
"Paula only took the fund over last August after her first law team left the case," she said, emphasizing that Mr. Whitehead's institute is committed to pay the lawyers' casework expenses but not those of Ms. Jones.
"She's going to get a big fat debt out of this," the spokeswoman insisted, noting that Ms. Jones's former lawyers already have filed an $800,000 lien for unpaid fees. "Paula's fund is going for things like a private investigator working down in Little Rock for two months in conjunction with the trial."
Ms. Carpenter-McMillan denied as "preposterous" the contention by the President's legal team that Ms. Jones has been increasing her income through the lawsuit and has hardly suffered economically. Ms. Jones is claiming damages in the civil suit, scheduled for trial May 27, which accuses Mr. Clinton of soliciting sex from her in 1991 while he was Governor of Arkansas and she was a state employee. She says she was discriminated against in her job because she rebuffed Mr. Clinton's advances.
The President has denied the allegation. His lawyer, Robert S. Bennett, denied the Jones camp's charge that he sought to sow dissent and that he disclosed details of the rival fund-raising operations, which appeared today in The Chicago Tribune. Mr. Bennett would not otherwise comment on the matter, citing the court's confidentiality order in the case. In earlier court papers, Mr. Bennett said that Ms. Jones had used several thousand dollars from the fund to pay for clothes and hairstyling.
"There are very legitimate costs," Ms. Carpenter-McMillan said, citing a kennel fee that she said Mr. Bennett distorted. "That was for $95 to board Mitzi, an old dog now deceased, when Paula was required to go out of town in behalf of the lawsuit."
Ms. Jones's fund shares the donations between herself and Bruce W. Eberle & Associates of McLean, Va., the professional fund-raising group that solicits public contributions. According to the fund's attorney, Brent Perry of Houston, it operates as a sole proprietorship controlled by Ms. Jones and her husband, Steve, and is carefully monitored by accountants. Mr. Perry denied reports that Ms. Jones received a $100,000 advance and a guarantee of more under terms of the fund's incorporation.
Mr. Whitehead said that Ms. Jones's lawyers -- Rader, Campbell, Fisher & Pyke of Dallas -- were largely working the case pro bono, while the Rutherford Institute subsidizes all their expenses, originally budgeted at $230,000 but now in excess of $300,000. "I've made it clear to Don Campbell," the senior partner in the law firm, "that we'll pay as much as it takes," he said.

HEADLINE: More Americans Are Getting Away From It All This Winter

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL

 BODY:
Thousands of skiers from Florida take their vacations at the Winter Park resort in Colorado this time of year. But last month Joan Christensen, an employee of Winter Park, headed for the Florida Keys with her husband, Dan, for a weeklong vacation.
"People from Florida are coming here for a snow fix," Ms. Christensen said, "and we're going there for a beach fix." 
 While an escape from the midwinter blues has long been a favorite American pastime, travelers are getting away in record numbers this winter. And that includes many places that might have never gotten a second look until recently.
A survey last fall by the nonprofit Travel Industry Association of America, which has been tracking American travel habits since 1992, found that nearly 153 million Americans planned to spend at least one night 100 miles or more from home this winter -- a 5 percent increase over last year.
"This is the highest volume of increased travel intentions ever measured," the association said. And with the end of winter now in sight, that early optimism does not appear misplaced -- thanks to a healthy economy, buoyant consumer confidence and low gasoline prices. Even higher leisure airline fares within the United States have not curbed the wanderlust.
Warm weather is still the prime lure. "We've had a strong winter season because the U.S. economy is so strong," said John Bell, the president of the Caribbean Hotel Association in San Juan, P.R. Similarly, Greater Miami appears on track for its fourth consecutive record-breaking season, despite almost a week of gusty winds and heavy rain in early February.
And while generally mild winter weather has apparently not slowed travel to such traditional winter hideouts as Arizona, Texas, Southern California and Florida, it has also encouraged more people to take spur-of-the moment visits to vacation spots closer to home.
For example, Martinsburg, Shepherdstown, Berkeley Springs and other towns in West Virginia's eastern panhandle are benefiting from record visits by weekenders and day trippers from out of state, especially from Washington and Baltimore.
"This is the best year for visitors in the five years since we've been keeping data," said David Blythe, executive director of the Martinsburg, W. Va., convention and visitors bureau. To enhance their tourist appeal, those West Virginia communities created a mix of artist colonies, attractive shops and inns, combined with the inevitable outlet centers. "Visitors would come to Harpers Ferry in the winter," Mr. Blythe said, "but you wouldn't find many of them coming and browsing around here, even though we're only 15 miles away."
A growing winter destination for sun lovers is St. George, Utah, a warm weather anomaly tucked into the southwestern corner of a state famous for its snow. The city's slogan, "Utah's Dixie," is emblazoned on the cover of its visitor's guide.
"We're just loving it here," Marge Leonard said. She and her husband, Paul, recently left their Idaho Falls, Idaho, home in snow and rain, lured by a four-day golf package offered by the Ramada Inn St. George. "My husband's an avid golfer," she said in a telephone interview, "and I'm an avid black belt shopper. Here I can walk to the factory outlet stores just outside the hotel door."
H. Paul Harker, the owner of that hotel, said guests came from many surrounding states and as far away as Alberta, many for golf and many to visit Zion and Bryce Canyon National Parks, 40 and 120 miles away, respectively. "February and March are our busiest time of the year," Mr. Harker said, "and so far this winter we're up about 6 percent over last year."
Winter tourism is also increasing in summer resorts that used to pull down the shutters by Halloween.
"After Labor Day you could look out and you wouldn't see a soul," said Diane Wieland, director of tourism for Cape May County, N.J. "But today you have to work at tourism because you can't operate just three months."
Newport, R.I., is another winter success story, attracting about one- third of the 3.5 million tourists who descend on the long-established resort town every year. "Winter's important to us, because that's where we still have room for growth," said Evan Smith of the Newport County Convention and Visitors Bureau. Like many resorts known mostly for summer tourism, the city sponsors a 10-day Winter Festival that features ice sculpturing and 100 other events as the centerpiece of a series of special weekly promotions.
The importance of winter tourism is underscored in much of the nation's frost belt, where cities that lack ski resorts are cashing in on the popularity of snowmobiles.
"The entire Upper Peninsula is exploding, mostly because of snowmobiles," said Richard Czuba, Michigan's director of tourism.
"Snowmobiles are responsible for an incredible evolution in many small towns in this part of the country," said Paul Nevanen, director of the Minnesota Cold Weather Resource Center in International Falls.
Even International Falls, the self-styled "icebox of the nation" markets its snowmobile trails to tourists -- as well as its midwinter Icebox Days Festival, complete with softball on frozen Rainy Lake and a Freeze Yer Gizzard Blizzard 10-kilometer race.
"You'd be surprised," said Shawn Mason, executive director of the International Falls Convention and Visitors Bureau, "how many people no longer think winter's a good excuse for staying home."

HEADLINE: THE NEEDIEST CASES;
Appeal Ending With a Record Sum

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS 

 BODY:
The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, which raises money for seven of the city's oldest and most prominent charities, winds up its 86th annual appeal today with a record-setting tally. Since Thanksgiving, when the campaign began, donors have sent the fund $5,449,158, compared with the $5,083,551 received in 1991-92, previously the most successful drive.
Contributions postmarked before midnight tonight will be added to this year's total, so there is still time to push that figure even higher. Donations received after today will be counted toward next year's campaign. 
 In an era of government cuts to social programs and shrinking public support for welfare, advocates for the poor say they have been heartened by the increase in giving.
"People seem to recognize that a robust economy does not benefit everyone," said Stephen D. Solender, executive vice president of the UJA-Federation of New York, one of the agencies supported by the fund. "As those of us who work with the most impoverished New Yorkers know, even in this time of plenty there are still thousands of people in dire straits who need our help."
Indeed, while construction cranes score the skyline and Wall Street revels in a soaring Dow, the city's working poor remain hobbled by low wages and high rents. The spreading affluence means little to the two million New Yorkers who live below the Federal poverty level, And with an 8.7 percent unemployment rate, nearly twice the national average, many New Yorkers have yet to enjoy the fruits of a booming economy.
"For many people, life has become so fragile that an unexpected crisis can lead to disaster," said Megan E. McLaughlin, executive director of the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies, another agency that benefits from the Neediest Cases Fund. "In these situations, a little help goes a long way."
This year, 11,187 people responded to daily articles in The Times that chronicled the struggles of the city's have-nots: people like Gail Atkins, an unemployed mother with AIDS whose two children are H.I.V. positive, and Sheila Gelb, an elderly widow with cancer who is too poor to feed herself properly. Every dollar donated went directly to the poor because The Times pays all administrative costs for the fund.
Although most contributions came from individuals, others were the result of a team effort. At the Greenwich Japanese School in Connecticut, eighth-graders collected $271.27 by selling homemade pastries and cakes in the school's hallway. Employees of The Associated Press in Manhattan raised $500 at their annual book sale, and the 33 members of New York City Ballet Orchestra sent a total of $2,280.
This month, The Times's annual employee book sale brought in $17,904, about $7,400 more than last year and the largest amount ever raised by the sale. The merchandise -- books, videotapes, CD's and clothing -- was donated by Times employees. A supplementary gift from Arthur Sulzberger Jr., the publisher of The Times, brought this year's book sale total to $25,000.
A record contribution also came from Wall Street. Although several of the nine participating firms have yet to submit their donations, $187,136 has been collected from employees of brokerages like Salomon Smith Barney, Bear Stearns and Goldman Sachs. Last year, $180,000 was raised by the first- and second-year analysts who orchestrate the fund's Wall Street campaign.
In the next Neediest Cases appeal, The New York Times Company Foundation, which administers the fund, will organize visits to some of New York's most desperate neighborhoods for those in the financial community, to raise their awareness of the poor and the nonprofit agencies that serve them.
"We think it is important to give people a firsthand look at what a difference charity can make to people who are trying to survive in the most forlorn parts of the city," said Arthur Gelb, president of the foundation.

HEADLINE: A Sense of Place;
Milwaukee Feels at Home in the N.L., Even if Its Team Doesn't

BYLINE: By CLAIRE SMITH 

DATELINE: MARYVALE, Ariz.

 BODY:
Is it better to be a National League team in the American League, or a National League team in the National League?
The Milwaukee Brewers are about to find out. An American League team with a proclivity toward playing a National League style, as designed by Manager Phil Garner, Milwaukee is baseball's lone realignment testing ground, moving from the A.L. Central to the N.L. Central this year. 
 The move is perhaps a precursor to major realignment once more reluctant teams get the spirit. For now it is a curiosity. In one sense it fits the franchise like a glove, yet it is discomfiting.
Milwaukee was the home of the Braves until that N.L. team moved to Atlanta in 1966. And the city that watched Henry Aaron, Warren Spahn and Eddie Mathews grow into Hall of Famers never forgot its major league roots, not even when the Seattle Pilots of the American League moved to Milwaukee in the form of the Brewers in 1970.
"We did a poll, and it showed that 85 percent wanted us to switch leagues," said Sal Bando, the Brewers' general manager. "So it told me the roots go very deep even a generation removed from when the Braves were there."
The enthusiasm, which has boosted ticket sales, has actually made a convert of Garner, who admits that he was not excited about the move at first. "The fans have made me excited," he said. "They're really into it."
As for the economics, the Brewers, long a struggling small-market team, are happy to say goodbye to a division that held the big-market Chicago White Sox and Cleveland Indians. "We can't compete at that level," Bando said. "At least in the National League Central, with the Reds, Pittsburgh, they're more within our arena, and we can compete better that way."
The comfort zone on the field may be more difficult to find.
Yes, the N.L. may be metamorphosing into more of a hitter's league as Astroturf teams that relied on speed alone slowly go the way of the surface itself. Yet, even as the images of Maury Wills and Lou Brock give way to the muscle of Mike Piazza and Mark McGwire, the Brewers will not necessarily feel as if they never left the American League. In many ways, what is a homecoming for some fans will seem like a move into uncharted territory for the players.
It is as if every player's nightmare about winding up in an alien world without a scouting report has been multiplied to the 25th power. Pitchers who have rarely lifted a bat must now bunt, hit and run the bases because they are in a league without designated hitters. Hitters who thrived amid the high earned run averages of the American League will now have the pleasure of facing 100-mile-an-hour relievers like Robb Nen and an Atlanta Braves team that is three-deep in Cy Young award winners.
So the Brewers look to seers. Like Marquis Grissom, a center fielder who grew up with the N.L. Expos and Braves before spending last season with the A.L. champion Indians.
"He's extremely critical," Garner said. "We're going to use him as another set of eyes, another databank on the league. And if our scouting reports say to play this guy the other way and Marquis wants to play him to pull, we're going to do what Marquis wants."
There are more than half a dozen other players on the roster with National League experience, but there is plenty of cramming taking place all over the Brewers' new spring training complex here. The most intriguing involves the pitchers, who are approaching life on offense like newborns.
"You hold your breath every time they slide," Bando said.
So do the pitchers. "I can run, but sliding, I don't think I'll be able to do that," said Jose Mercedes, a starting pitcher. "I'll be trying as good as I can, but I don't want to hurt my knee."
Then again, Mercedes is not presumptuous enough to assume he will even get on base often. "My job is to pitch, to strike the hitters out," Mercedes said. "Everybody likes to power hit, but I don't know how. To hit with power, you have to be able to hit the ball first."
Still, Garner says he has liked what he has seen in his pitchers' efforts. And he does not expect perfection in this first full week of batting practice. But Garner will demand competence by the time the season starts.
"They have to know when to go an extra base, and I don't want to see them doubled off every time there is a line drive in the infield," the manager said. "Our pitchers are intelligent. They should be able to make good judgments."
Should they not, Garner cautions, outings could be short and not so sweet. "If I see that they cannot handle the bat at all, then they're going to be taken out of the game," said Garner, whose pitchers were 0 for 18 during interleague games last season. "I'm going to be forced to use a pinch-hitter. So it's incumbent on them to learn to bunt, because it only helps them."
As for managing, Garner, too, has homework to do. He has long been credited with running a National League style offense in the spirit of the Pirates and Astros teams for which he spent the major portion of his playing career. Still, Garner last worked in the N.L. in 1991 as a coach with the Astros. He knows his re-entry will not be seamless.
"We might not get him out, but when we face a Frank Thomas, I'll go to the mound with a certain idea," Garner said. "I won't have that same comfort with Barry Bonds.
"I'll have scouting reports and all this information at my fingertips, but it's not the same as having embellished that with what you've seen with your own eyes. And that's going to take a little time."
How long? "I hope we're acclimated in spring training, but, in reality, I don't know," Garner said. "We don't know the hitters, the pitchers, the umpires, the fields. We just don't know the league."

HEADLINE: Colombian Peasants Seek Way Out of Drug Trade

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO 

DATELINE: POPAYAN, Colombia

 BODY:
At first, nothing could have been easier for these struggling rural hamlets than getting into the drug business. Up and down the Valle del Cauca these scattered villages climbed on the coca bandwagon early, enjoying a five-year joyride that is still referred to here to as La Bonanza.
But as more and more farmers grew coca instead of food, prices for coca leaf dropped, and the cost of food they had to buy soared. Cropdusters financed by American anti-drug efforts poisoned the harvest. And gradually, the problems that cocaine has fueled in urban ghettos -- violence, shattered families and an addiction to easy money were reaching back to the valley like a curse returning to its roots. 
 As life unraveled, the coca growers learned that although Colombia was spending $1.1 billion a year fighting drug trafficking, and Washington was pouring more than $100 million a year into Colombia's anti-narcotics police, hardly any of that money was available to help communities stop growing illegal crops.
Washington's strategy in Colombia, where some 80 percent of the cocaine sold in the United States originates, never included the highly effective programs in Bolivia and Peru that have helped peasants raise alternative crops.
Indeed, while drug crops in Bolivia and Peru -- where fumigation is banned -- have continued to fall, the world's leading producer of coca last year was Colombia, where fumigation is Washington's weapon of choice.
"It's ironic and disturbing that the one country where you have massive aerial eradication is the one where you've got an increase in coca production," said Coletta A. Youngers, a senior associate at the Washington Office on Latin America, a nonprofit policy research organization. "There's something fundamentally wrong there."
 After two years of imposing sanctions on Colombia for a lack of drug enforcement, the Clinton Administration announced on Thursday that it would to grant a waiver to Colombia this year as an acknowledgment that it is making progress in destroying crops. But the results have not been encouraging. Last year Colombian pilots poisoned nearly 99,000 acres of coca crops in the most intense program ever, and yet the total area under coca cultivation rose nearly 20 percent.
Far from the hardscrabble roads where peasants live all but forgotten by their Government, Washington formulates policies to reduce drug trafficking by attacking bridges, blowing up labs and poisoning crops.
The strategy's limited successes are trumpeted widely. But less well known is the way that policy affects the peasants who took up illegal crops, in a Faustian bargain to join the middle class.
"They confuse us with the Cali or Medellin cartel," said Eider Gironza Mamian, a coca grower whose community is weighing the prospects of ending coca cultivation. "Maybe they think we're rich, too, but in reality, we're poor. And our children go hungry."
Under President Ernesto Samper, whose relations with Washington have been plagued with accusations that Cali drug dealers bankrolled his election, the Colombian Government has tried to promote crop substitution with aid from the European Union and the United Nations. But the dearth of help from the United States has sown deep bitterness among Colombians.
Indeed, United States officials at the Bank for Inter-American Development recently voted against a $90 million loan to increase crop substitution work in Colombia, an automatic consequence of Washington's decertification of Colombia over the past two years as a partner in the fight against drug trafficking. At the same time, the United States anti-narcotics funding for Latin America's military and police forces more than tripled between 1996 and 1997, according to a report by the Washington Office on Latin America. Most of the money goes for shooting down planes transporting coca leaves or paste to Mexico and Colombia from Bolivia and Peru, destroying crops and seizing drugs bound for the United States.
Still, the seizure of tens of thousands of tons of heroin and cocaine between 1988 and 1995, and the destruction of about 135,000 acres of coca had "made little impact on the availability of illegal drugs in the United States and on the amount needed to satisfy U.S. demand," according to 1997 report by the General Accounting Office.
A State Department official said that in the 1980's the Bush Administration offered the Andean nations crop substitution programs along with military and police aid to battle drug smuggling. While Peru and Bolivia were interested in the alternative crop idea, the Colombian military and the police traded agricultural aid for increased military assistance, the official said.
Officially, the United States Government has no plans to switch tactics in Colombia. In a statement , Randall Beers, Acting Assistant Secretary for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, defended fumigation as "the most cost-effective way to reduce narcotics substances, particularly in areas not under control of the central Government."
One State Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the emphasis on fumigating crops was likely to intensify. "The feeling is very strong to push on in Colombia, regardless of what the results are," the official said. The rationale was that fumigation could succeed if applied more thoroughly, and neither the Colombian nor the United States Government wanted to shower agricultural programs on regions believed to be under guerrilla influence.
For the Colombian military, the resumption of American anti-drug aid is being eagerly awaited as a boost in the fighting against leftist guerrillas, the chief of the combined armed forces, Gen. Manuel Jose Bonnet, said in an interview.
In recent years the political breakdown in Colombia has weakened the traditional ties of peasants to the land. Civil strife pitting the army and landowner-financed paramilitary groups against leftist guerrillas, and the purchase of vast tracts of farmland by drug barons, has displaced an estimated 1.2 million Colombians from rural areas, according to human rights organizations here.
Since the country's economic opening in the early 1990's, promoted by the United States, thousands of small farmers in Colombia have gone out of business, unable to compete with the world prices for corn, rice and other grains, said Juan Manuel Ospina, president of the Colombian Farmer's Society.
Many families displaced by the upheaval have drifted to remote frontiers and grow coca where the lack of roads to market is not a problem. For coca and poppy, traffickers fly into clandestine airstrips.
Abigail Velazco, a 41-year-old Guambiare Indian who grew poppy in the mountains outside Popayan, said drug dealers first appeared after a disease destroyed the tribe's potato and onion harvest.
If the importance of an agriculture extension service in the remote mountain home of the Guambiare had not occurred to the Government, the same could not be said of the drug dealers. Mr. Velazco said the first trafficker, a North American who went by a name that he said sounded like Don Ever, supplied seeds, fertilizer, four months' worth of groceries and a pledge to buy the harvest for a set price.
"It started out with only a few people growing wild poppies," said Francisco Muelas, the tribal chief's agricultural adviser. "After that, flowers started appearing everywhere."
Before long, 70 percent of the 13,500 Guambiare had given up raising food crops to grow poppy for the traffickers, cutting down forest to do so. Like the lowland Colombians growing coca, the Guambiare saw the fabric of their culture -- respect for nature, families and the head of the tribe -- fray amid the influx of money, strangers and violence. "The community said, 'Look, we're destroying ourselves. Why don't we pick up our traditions, recover our way of life?' " Mr. Muelas said.
Pushed by their leader, the community presented the Government with a "Plan of Life" to help the Guambiare give up drugs. It was not easy, admitted Mr. Muelas. Some tribesmen threatened the leader's life, and a letter purporting to be from the local commander of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, Latin America's oldest Marxist guerrilla group, warned the tribe not to stop growing poppy.
But the tribe's reaction was an unusual demonstration of its conviction and courage: it chose a group to trek up the mountain and explain the "Plan of Life." After talking, the guerrillas denied having made any threat and pledged not to interfere in the tribe's switch to legal crops.
Though officials in Washington said guerrillas in Colombia are an impediment to Government crop substitution efforts, Juan Carlos Palou, the director of Plante, Colombia's crop substitution program, said no farmer had ever been killed for giving up illicit crops.
Now, the Guambiares' program, backed by some financing from the Colombian Government, is a showcase for crop substitution. Fields where poppy had been growing are planted with corn, onions and beans. The tribe is raising 500 chickens.
The Guambiares built an aqueduct to divert water from a nearby river to a fish hatchery, where they are raising trout from eggs imported from California. They have cleared the forest around a highland lake where they plan to build a fishing resort, and a factory makes concrete blocks to build houses.
Measuring the success is tricky, because crops abandoned in the Valle may pop up under the Amazon canopy where they are harder to eradicate. It is slow work turning around a community's decay against a continuing increase in both coca production and fumigation.
"Nobody ever calls the hard line into question on the basis of results," Mr. Palou said. "But people are always asking for results when you take a mild line."

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
Iraq Of Ages

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

 BODY:
Saddam Hussein is a recurring figure in Middle East history -- the local despot who upsets the regional order by being too rapacious at home and abroad. But while you can't understand what's happening in this Iraq crisis without reference to some of the region's oldest political patterns, you also can't understand it without reference to some more modern political trends -- namely U.S. hegemony after the cold war and globalization.
It is only when you combine the medieval with the postmodern that you can fully grasp this Iraq story. Let's start with the question of why the U.S. has virtually no allies against Iraq. There are a number of reasons, but surely a critical one is that America today stands astride the world with so much superior economic, technological and military power that it breeds two important reactions: resentment and complacency. 
 What does Iran call the U.S. today? It's not "the great Satan" anymore. Iran says America is "the capital of global arrogance." Well, guess what? That's what the French, the Russians, the Japanese, the Chinese and the Arabs also call America behind its back. There is a deep resentment brewing out there against the U.S. Part of it's sheer envy of America's recent economic success. Part is a feeling that America throws its weight around unfairly, particularly when it comes to Arabs and Israelis. And part of it is because Americanization, from Mickey Mouse to Microsoft, has become a powerful, tempting and frequently destabilizing force, challenging every traditional society.
France, Russia, China and the Arabs aren't going to go to war with America because of its dominance; they just want to make sure we don't get to enjoy it. France is so obsessed about being a second-rate economic and military power compared with the U.S. that it would rather see Saddam keep some poison gas than side with U.S. efforts to confront him. Saddam has shrewdly tapped into this mood, presenting himself as the Arab "little guy" standing up to the American bully.
The flip side of resentment is complacency. Why are the Saudis and the other Arabs, who live right next door to Iraq, so reluctant to cooperate with the U.S. in confronting Saddam? In part it's because they assume that, as the world's overwhelming, sole superpower, the U.S. will feel compelled to confront Saddam whether the Arabs support America or not. So the Saudis say, "Why expose ourselves to retaliation from Iraq or anger from our own street when the Americans will take care of it free?"
Where globalization comes into the story is that it weaves together and diffuses revolutions in science, computing, miniaturization and telecommunications in a way that enables smaller and smaller groups and individuals -- no matter where they live -- to reach farther and farther around the world, faster and faster, cheaper and cheaper. For those with good intentions it empowers them to shape their own world or to participate in the global economy more than ever. But for those with bad intentions, or antipathy to the U.S., it empowers them to lash out more forcefully than ever.
So from one direction American hegemony fuels envy, resentment and even hatred of the U.S., and from another direction globalization empowers the haters -- by making more easily available the means of mass destruction and by wiring the world so that a small bomb in the right place can create anxiety for a billion people. That is why the main threat to America today is not another hostile superpower. There are none, for now. The main threat to U.S. and global stability is the super-empowered individual -- the super-empowered angry man (or woman).
That's also why the proper analogy for the Iraq crisis is not Vietnam or Munich. It's the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, masterminded by Ramzi Yousef, the quintessential super-empowered angry man. Ramzi Yousef had no political program, or ideology, other than hating America and Israel. Saddam is Ramzi Yousef with part of a country. That is, Saddam is something more than the leader of a terrorist band, but something less than the leader of a unified state. That's why confronting and disempowering him is both difficult and vitally necessary.
Saddam may be a 13th-century tyrant, but he is the epitome of the 21st-century threat. The good news is that Saddam Hussein can't be a superpower. But the bad news is that, in today's world, a lot of people can be Saddam Hussein.

HEADLINE: Revised School Aid Figures Due Next Week, State Says

BYLINE: By JENNIFER PRESTON 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Feb. 27

 BODY:
A week after acknowledging that they had made mistakes in allocating school aid to some local districts for the coming school year, Whitman administration officials vowed today to revise the aid figures by Tuesday.
But that gives the districts little time to meet the state's deadline of Wednesday for completing their budgets.
After the State Education Department released aid figures two weeks ago, many school districts began questioning their allocations under the new figures. Then, last week, the state found that a new formula was allocating millions of dollars to the wrong school districts this year. 
 As a result, a team of accountants and computer analysts started going through more than 3.8 million individual state income tax returns, which for the first time are the basis for state school aid.
State officials said at a news conference at the State House today that they have narrowed possible discrepancies to about two dozen school districts. But Education Commissioner Leo F. Klagholz said that possible changes in those two dozen districts could lead to revisions in many more districts. None of the state officials would estimate how many school districts could be affected.
Mr. Klagholz, along with State Treasurer James A. DiEleuterio Jr., said the confusion was caused because some taxpayers erroneously reported their home municipalities on their state income tax forms. Those mistakes changed the state's estimate of districts' wealth, which in turn altered the amount of aid.
This is the first time the state has depended on data from state income tax returns to determine income levels and property values in communities. In the past, the state relied on census data, but chose to use information from tax returns this year because it is more up to date.
As a community's affluence rises, its aid declines. For example, some taxpayers in Monroe Township in Middlesex County mistakenly stated that they lived in neighboring Jamesburg, which is what they use as their post office address. Jamesburg ended up with a $314,345 reduction in state aid because it appeared that its income level had significantly increased. In Lakehurst, in Ocean County, school officials estimated that the faulty data had cost their school district about $400,000 in state aid.
Frank Belluscio, a spokesman for the New Jersey School Boards Association, said the state's effort to correct errors in allocations did not address many superintendents' and school board officials' broader concerns about the new formula.
Since the state is relying on 1995 income tax forms rather than 1989 census data, school districts in fast-growing towns, in particular, have seen a significant jump in the state's estimate of their overall wealth. Therefore, their state aid for regular education programs fell sharply.
The state aid figures released two weeks ago showed that 228 of the state's 611 school districts would receive less aid this year than last year. In addition, 177 school districts would have received increases that are lower than the rate of inflation. There was an overall $550 million increase in state education aid this year, but most of that money was for teachers' pensions.
"Some school districts are being asked to make abrupt changes," Mr. Belluscio said. "It really needs to be phased in, so that they don't have to cut back on programs."
Craig Heard, president of the Roxbury Township School Board in Morris County, said state aid to his district had not increased for seven years, even though enrollment had steadily risen. This year, the new formula cost his district $1.1 million in aid, he said. The school board had not anticipated such a deep cut, forcing either a steep rise in property taxes or deep cuts in school programs, he said.
"To have a $1.1 million cut in one year is too much," Mr. Heard said. "The burden keeps going back to the local property taxpayer."
Since the deadline for preparing budgets falls so soon, the state plans to grant waivers for districts whose state aid would change.
In addition, Mr. Heard and other school board officials are expected to meet next week to outline a strategy to ask lawmakers and the Whitman administration to consider revising the formula so that school districts do not have to choose, in a single year, to cut programs or increase property taxes.

HEADLINE: Grade Inflation Is Often Cover for Bad Teaching;
Faculty Is Powerless

 BODY:

To the Editor:
In one of your Feb. 24 letters on grade inflation, Philip M. Katz mentions the "fear on the part of teaching fellows and junior faculty" that "tough grading may lead to poor evaluations, which will not help them in a shrinking academic job market." He concludes that only senior faculty can provide a remedy. 
 Unfortunately, tenured faculty are under comparable pressure. Course evaluations forms are now required in many institutions, and salaries are influenced by the results. When I joined the University of Michigan 30 years ago, my salary was higher than that of any member of the anthropology department who is still active today. My standards for grading have not followed the trend toward inflation. Student complaints about grades have increased, and now my salary is at the bottom of the professorial list.

HEADLINE: Grade Inflation Is Often Cover for Bad Teaching;
Include a Relative Score

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re the Feb. 24 letters you published on grade inflation at Princeton: Though the problem may not be so great as to warrant major changes in grading criteria, a solution is simple. Performance in a class should be recorded by two figures: a letter grade and a percentile score (showing the rank of a student relative to all others taking the class that term). Thus, an "A-90" would indicate significantly better performance than an "A-75." 
 This type of system is already in use for the Medical College Admission Test and Graduate Record Examination scores coming out of college, and even my research grant applications. Thus, including a relative score is an accepted method of evening out differences in absolute scores because of different graders or institutions. However, it is usually used as a supplement to, rather than a replacement for, absolute scores -- and rightly so.

HEADLINE: Grade Inflation Is Often Cover for Bad Teaching;
Perverse Obsession

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Right on schedule comes the annual ritual of harumphing that students are getting too many A's -- this time at Princeton (letters, Feb. 24). 
 However, the real issue is not how many students are getting A's but how many students are taught that getting A's is the point of school. Research has established three consistent effects of causing students to focus on grades: lower quality learning, preference for the easiest possible assignments and less interest in the learning itself.
The failure of our schools can be measured by the number of students who have been trained to ask their instructors: "Do we have to know this? Is this going to be on the test?"
The problem isn't grade inflation -- it's grades.

HEADLINE: Stay, Nebraska Begs Brightest, We'll Pay You

BYLINE: By PAM BELLUCK 

DATELINE: OMAHA

 BODY:
Brian Knudtson is a convert. At least, people in Nebraska hope so.
Last year, from where he sat as a high school senior in Blair, Neb., Mr. Knudtson, a top student and computer whiz, had a few bedrock priorities. He wanted a good college for computer science -- like Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh or the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago -- and he set as "one of my main criteria -- leaving Nebraska." 
 But Mr. Knudtson was not counting on the head-spinning hard sell.
With a zeal that would put any jalopy salesman to shame, Nebraska businesses gave Mr. Knudtson a full four-year scholarship to a brand-new computer science and technology college that businesses and the state government had spent $70 million to establish. He received money for books and an apartment in Omaha, a top-of-the-line computer and a challenging paid internship at one of Omaha's thriving high-technology companies, which has been about as subtle as thunder in seducing him for a full-time job after college.
At 18 he got more than he had ever imagined, so for now he is staying.
Chalk one up for the Cornhusker State, but the battle is far from over. Nebraska is on an all-out quest for smart people.
"We've been experiencing a brain drain," said Gov. Ben Nelson, who is pushing a bill that would pay up to half of the undergraduate or graduate school costs for smart students -- if they agree to stay on after college and work for three years in Nebraska. "We began to realize we had a serious problem. We want to try to reverse that and have a brain gain."
In many ways, Nebraska's desperate search for highly skilled workers is a reflection of the revved-up national economy squeezing a region that for years has watched many of its youngest, best and brightest go elsewhere.
That talent drain helped produce a state unemployment rate of 1.6 percent -- one-third the national average and the lowest of any state. From 1990 to 1996, the number of jobs in Nebraska grew by 13 percent, while the population increased by only 5 percent. In the third quarter of last year, 22,000 full-time jobs were created, but nearly half as many jobs went unfilled, according to the Bureau of Business Research at the University of Nebraska. The state's increasingly boisterous information technology industry is feeling the pinch, as it competes with companies nationwide for talented people.
Great Plains states like Nebraska, Iowa, Kansas and the Dakotas have begun to recover from the farm crisis of the 1980's, gradually replenishing their once-shrinking populations with Hispanic and Southeast Asian immigrants and some returning natives. But holding on to their young people, especially college graduates, has been another matter entirely.
"It really is a regional problem," said Jerry Deichert, a senior research associate at the Center for Public Affairs Research of the University of Nebraska at Omaha. "Even though there's been in-migration, they're still losing young adults in their 20's."
They head for places more cosmopolitan and less topographically challenged, places with skiable slopes and surfable waves.
And they worry that the dynamic business and educational centers of the country look askance at people from states that are not yet as well-known for their computer skills as they are for their cows.
"The impression is there's a lot happening in the world that isn't really happening in Nebraska," said Stephanie Geiger, a student at the University of Nebraska at Lincoln who intends to leave the state for medical school and her career.
Ms. Geiger says she gets a first-hand taste of the attitudes of outsiders through her part-time polling job at Gallup.
"You have to say you're calling from Lincoln, Neb., and they make all kinds of comments," Ms. Geiger said. "Somebody from L.A. asked me, 'Do you have running water?' "
In an interview last week, Governor Nelson bemoaned a recent study that showed, he said, "Half our college graduates leave." That study also found that the propensity to stay in the state seems to be inversely proportional to how well a student does on the American College Test for undergraduate admission. "The higher the A.C.T score, the greater the chance of them leaving," he said.
As a result, with the combined muscle of legislative power and corporate backing, Nebraska is now going after "brains" much the same way the University of Nebraska at Lincoln might court quarterbacks for its championship football squad.
The popular Brain Gain bill (sponsored by a Governor whose four children went to college outside Nebraska, although they eventually returned), would pay up to $5,000 a year for college tuition for high-achieving students, measured by a yet-to-be-determined combination of test scores, grades and other criteria. Another bill working its way through the legislature would offer in-state tuition to smart students who live in neighboring states and to the smart children of people who used to live in Nebraska -- people who did military service or attended college here and then moved on. Those students would have to score at least 31 out of a possible 36 on the A.C.T. or 1360 out of 1600 on the S.A.T.
Businesses, particularly those in the corridor between Omaha and Lincoln, which the state hopes will become known as the Silicon Prairie, are devoting substantial resources to the effort, including $47 million for the creation of the Peter Kiewit Institute of Information Sciences, Technology and Engineering, named after the construction, mining and technology giant. It intends to be the M.I.T. of the cornfields.
Although the school is under the umbrella of the University of Nebraska at Omaha (the state put $23.5 million into its startup), business leaders make up most of the college's advisory board and they help interview prospective faculty members and shape the curriculum to keep students on top of the latest innovations. Classes began last year in the university's classrooms, but a building is rising on land donated by First Data Resources, the credit card processing company, on the site of the old Ak-Sar-Ben race track. (Nebraskans know Ak-Sar-Ben is Nebraska spelled backward.)
"The businesses in Omaha were screaming for more talent," said Eva Fujan, director of recruiting for Inacom, which installs and monitors computer networks for companies like Pepsico and the Chrysler Corporation. More than a quarter of Inacom's employees, or 1,100 people, are in Omaha, and the company expects to have openings for another 300 in the state, and 2,000 nationwide, every year for the foreseeable future.
Like other businesses, Inacom is giving internships to bright students like Brian Knudtson, hoping they will stay with the company.
Last year, Inacom began paying its workers bonuses for referrals of qualified employees who were hired. It also watches for layoffs by other companies, recently swooping into Denver to set up a job fair in a hotel right next door to a company that had just laid off workers.
But getting people, especially young adults, to move to Omaha has its obstacles. An article last month in The Omaha World-Herald began this way: "Here's a quiz for computer-skilled workers across the country: Omaha is the home of: A. Omaha who? B. Lots of cattle pens. C. Marlin Perkins. D. A growing array of high-tech companies that want to hire you. Unfortunately for recruiters, many technology-savvy workers' image of the city might be close to A, B or C."
But the Omaha metropolitan area, with about 680,000 people, has been working hard to enhance its attraction. No longer just a cow town and President Gerald R. Ford's birthplace, it has an established opera company, museums, a children's theater and a zoo with the world's largest indoor jungle, according to the Greater Omaha Chamber of Commerce. It has a low crime rate and good schools. Families find it friendly and easygoing.
Nebraska's business leaders say prospective employees from outside the state have not so much a negative image of the place as no image.
"We haven't done a very good job of promoting Omaha and Nebraska, so it's no wonder we seem like a blank," said Walter Scott Jr., the president and board chairman of Peter Kiewit & Sons.
"Our problem is we can't move any mountains here or any oceans here," Mr. Scott said. "We're stuck on the prairie. So we're going to have to make the most of what we have."
Mr. Scott and his company are principal benefactors of the new technology institute and the source of the full scholarships for Brian Knudtson and 25 other students attending the new college this year.
That largess, as well as persistent phone calls, stopped Matt Hall, a math and computer ace, in the middle of filling out his acceptance letter to Iowa State, and it persuaded Dana Svendsen of Omaha, an engineering student at the new institute, not to enroll at the University of California at Berkeley.
"To tell you the truth, I wanted to get out of Omaha," Ms. Svendsen said. "But this sounded too good to be true. And so far, it is all they said it was."
How well all these efforts will work remains to be seen.
Daniel Brox, a former honors student at the University of Nebraska at Lincoln, who left for Chicago after graduation to work for Andersen Consulting and now works for Sabre Decision Technologies, said the inducements would not have changed his mind. He said that coming from aPrairie state carried the stigma of not being as sharp and savvy as Californians or New Yorkers.
"For the most part you're just hamstringing yourself if you stay there," Mr. Brox, 22, said. "Plus, I definitely wanted to get to Chicago or New York or San Francisco, where there's a little bit more to do on the weekends."
But P. J. Chavanu, 23, who moved to Houston for a job with Price Waterhouse after graduating from Creighton University, said that despite the handicaps the financial incentive of a "brain gain" law would have kept him at home, at least temporarily. "I would have stayed there," he said. "Three years isn't a lot of time."

"The impression is there's a lot happening in the world that isn't really happening in Nebraska," says Stephanie Geiger, right, who, like Crystal Keeler, left, hopes to find a medical school and a career out of state.

HEADLINE: N.A.A.C.P. Post Gives Julian Bond New Start

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 27

 BODY:
On the wall of Julian Bond's impeccably neat study hangs a black and white picture of Mr. Bond as a skinny, 2-year-old boy in short pants, holding hands with two famous black intellectuals, E. Franklin Frazier and W. E. B. Du Bois.
The photograph, taken in 1942, is graphic evidence of how much Mr. Bond, 58, is steeped in the history of African Americans and the struggle for black advancement. His father, Horace Mann Bond, an educator who was president of Fort Valley State College and Lincoln University -- two historically black colleges -- knew Booker T. Washington, broke bread with Du Bois and helped write briefs for the landmark school desegregation case Brown v. Board of Education. 
 That history helps explain why Mr. Bond was chosen last Saturday to be chairman of the board of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, an unpaid, policy-making position.
"It sets me apart, but not radically," Mr. Bond said of his personal background. "I think for people of my age and generation, this was a normal experience -- not to have W. E. B. Du Bois in your home, but to have his name in your home, to know about him in your home, to have grown up in this movement. This was dinner table conversation for us."
The choice seems right out of central casting: a handsome, well-spoken intellectual from the heart of the civil rights establishment takes over its oldest institution and, its officials hope, helps lead it out of its doldrums.
Mr. Bond is a reluctant savior, if he turns out to be a savior at all. After telling friends and acquaintances that he was not interested in the post, he changed his mind and put his name forward after receiving entreaties from some of the board's 64 members and others, who argued that his renown and middle-of-the-road philosophy would assure fund-raisers and traditional supporters.
"Julian is a star," said Michael Meyers, head of the New York Civil Rights Coalition and, in recent years, a frequent critic of the N.A.A.C.P. "Julian is a celebrity. He's well known in the N.A.A.C.P. circles, in the women's movement, in labor circles and in the civil liberties community."
He is also a throwback to the N.A.A.C.P.'s unabashedly integrationist philosophy which, in recent years, has been diluted as the group's board and membership have become increasingly black and its rhetoric increasingly reflective of a black nationalist philosophy. At the news conference after his election, Mr. Bond emphasized that he believed the "colored" in the organization's name meant people of all colors and that he would actively recruit people of all races.
"As members and as partners," he said in an interview. "Of course, we already belong to numerous coalitions that cut across cultural lines. But I just want to send a signal that there are no racial restrictions to participation with the N.A.A.C.P."
To some, his elevation to the increasingly high profile job as N.A.A.C.P. board chairman, replacing Myrlie Evers-Williams, represents more than a recognition of his history and star power. It is, for him, another chance.
As a younger man, Mr. Bond was considered by many the true prince-in-waiting, the one with the wit, grace, intelligence and style to inherit the mantle of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Indeed, a 1970 poll of African-Americans found him their overwhelming choice for President. But for some, Mr. Bond's potential always seemed unrealized, and, after a youth filled with promise, his achievements few.
Rather than becoming the next great civil rights leader, Mr. Bond ended up with what some described as a lackluster career as a Georgia legislator, with a failed marriage and accused of drug use.
"I think that the 60's depleted a lot of people," said Roger Wilkins, a professor of history at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va. "The intensity of the struggle, the danger of the struggle, the bitter divisions among the parties to the struggle -- all of that left a lot of people who were active depleted and unable to function at 100 percent of capacity. This afflicted a lot of people, and I don't think Julian was immune to it."
As a student at Morehouse College, Mr. Bond organized sit-ins and demonstrations that desegregated parks, theaters and restaurants in Atlanta. He was one of the organizers of the Student Non-violent Co-ordinating Committee, which provided the shock troops for the sit-ins and Freedom Rides. At age 25, he was elected to the Georgia House of Representatives, but it took a Supreme Court decision to overcome the refusal of his fellow lawmakers to seat him, ostensibly because of his outspoken opposition to the Vietnam War.
Perhaps his high point came during the tumultuous 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago when the baby-faced civil rights advocate was nominated as a protest candidate for Vice President. Mr. Bond, then 28, could not have actually gotten the nomination because he was too young.
The convention appeared to be the apex of his life. For several years afterward, he seemed on a long slow slide toward mediocrity.
As a lawmaker, Mr. Bond once described himself as "a little lazy," and a person who did "not have the self-discipline to be a better legislator." During that time Mr. Bond underwent a messy divorce that included accusations -- later recanted -- from his former wife that he used cocaine and that his girlfriend at the time had assaulted her.
In 1986, he gave up his seat in the Georgia Senate to run for Congress, but was defeated by a former S.N.C.C. colleague, John Lewis, who, among other things, demanded that his one-time comrade in the civil rights struggle take a drug test. The campaign left Mr. Bond more than $150,000 in debt.
"That was a trying traumatic period for me," Mr. Bond said. "There are still people who think it's the signature part of my life."
Unemployed and under scrutiny, Mr. Bond moved to Washington, remarried -- his wife, Pamela Horowitz, is a lawyer -- got a job teaching history and government at the University of Virginia and American University, and paid off his debts with the help of another former S.N.C.C. colleague, Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr., who was host to several fund-raisers.
Mr. Bond was loath to talk about his personal struggles. "It was a little window in my life, lasting a couple of months, maybe two months," Mr. Bond said. "I'm 58. I've had many months."
He also rejected any notion that he had failed to live up to what others expected.
"To envision being governor or senator or even Congressman then was just unrealistic," he said. "I'd go to Chicago or New York or someplace and people would say, 'Boy, I'm sure you'd be a Congressman or a senator by now.'
"Well, there's no black senator from Georgia or anyplace else down there. It wasn't meant to be."
While the years have turned his soft curly hair gray, Mr. Bond still retains the looks, deep voice and telegenic quality of his youth.
Some wonder whether there will be competition between him and Kweisi Mfume, the N.A.A.C.P.'s president and chief executive. "It's just a matter of time before Kweisi packs his bags," Mr. Meyers said. "You can't have two stars, and, in a contest between Julian and Kweisi, Julian wins hands down."
But Mr. Bond insisted he would be able to work effectively with Mr. Mfume.
"There's enough here for everybody, not just for the two of us -- Kweisi and Julian Bond," he said. "There's enough here for everybody."
