HEADLINE: Trailblazers Heading to a New Shopping Destination

BYLINE: By CLAIRE WILSON

 BODY:
The wealthy have been synonymous with Wall Street since before the New York Stock Exchange was founded in 1792. But a prosperous group of potential shoppers had to move to the financial district before luxury retailers like Hermes, Thomas Pink and BMW could be persuaded to open stores in the neighborhood. 
 Recent residential conversions and new apartment construction have also induced Tiffany & Company, in business in Manhattan since 1837, to open a store downtown, according to Beth O. Canavan, Tiffany's executive vice president. The jewelry emporium will open its second Manhattan location at 37 Wall Street on Oct. 10. 
 ''We now have more of a 24/7 community, with laundries and bagel shops and all the things we need to live,'' Ms. Canavan said. ''What was missing was some great retailing.'' 
 The population below Chambers Street has increased 30 percent since 2001, now numbering just under 45,000. Perhaps even more impressive, the median household income is $165,000, about triple the median for Manhattan as a whole, according to the Alliance for Downtown New York, the business improvement district.
 Michael Stone, senior director for retail services at Cushman & Wakefield, gives all the credit for the luxury retail activity to the financial services industry, which employs a majority of downtown residents and doles out annual bonuses. 
 ''It's the men and women with high incomes and long hours who live and work here, but in many cases don't have time to go anyplace,'' he said. ''If you are Tiffany and Hermes, you've got to look at Wall Street.'' 
 The new round-the-clock nature of the neighborhood is a major factor in attracting retailers, but the revitalization of the office market is also critical, according to Nicole LaRusso, vice president for planning and economic development at the Downtown Alliance. New headquarters are planned for Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase & Company and Deutsche Bank, but it was an agreement reached in 2006 between the developer Larry Silverstein and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey that was in many ways a turning point, Ms. LaRusso said.
 That agreement provided a framework for the development of the World Trade Center site, with deadlines for completion of five towers, which would include 490,000 square feet of retail space. ''It is hard to overestimate how important that level of certainty is to the market when it comes to making leasing commitments,'' she said. 
 The nearly six million tourists that visit downtown annually are also important. At Thomas Pink, tourists were a profitable supplement to the core customers, who were on vacation or away on weekends in July and August. ''We noticed over the summer months that you lost the 9-to-5 customers but picked up the tourists,'' said Robert Dundon, president of Thomas Pink Inc. 
 The number of hotel rooms in the area will soar to 5,367 by 2010, from 2,197 this year, according to the Downtown Alliance. The neighborhood is also well-served by public transportation, making it a destination for shoppers from other parts of the city and the suburbs. 
 The new brands near Wall Street are expected to be only the tip of the high-end iceberg. The men's clothing store Hickey Freeman has opened on Broadway, and an Italian men's clothing store, Canali, will open in the next year.
 These retailers will get a boost from other newcomers serving the same clientele. They include restaurants like Bobby Van's Steakhouse, which opened last year; Haru, which is about to open; and Fresco, a Midtown Italian restaurant that recently announced a financial district opening.
 Prada Beauty has a spa at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel, and Sephora, the cosmetics chain, has signed a lease for a 7,500-square-foot space at Broadway and Liberty Street. Testimony to the new residential character of the district is the opening of a Gristede's supermarket on Maiden Lane. 
 In addition to Wall Street, there may be other high-end enclaves in the area. According to Robert K. Futterman, chief executive of Robert K. Futterman & Associates, a retail brokerage agency, the retail component at the Fulton Street Transit Center, where many subway lines will converge, will be ''strictly limited to luxury brands.'' 
 Brokers speculate that shops at the World Trade Center site will be a mix of better quality and high-end stores, a direction in which it had been heading before Sept. 11. 
 ''It had been improving for years and was getting better and better,'' said Mr. Stone of Cushman & Wakefield, which last month opened an office on Pine Street to capitalize on the retail expansion. ''It was one of the highest performing malls in the country.'' 
 Hermes and Thomas Pink are test cases that many luxury retailers have been watching since they opened in June. Both companies say they have had good results, particularly after Labor Day, when Hermes opened on Saturdays for the first time. 
 ''We are in the right place,'' said Robert B. Chavez, the president and chief executive of Hermes USA. He believes the store at 15 Broad Street will be among the group's top three revenue producers in this country. It has 17 stores in the United States and sells its products in 37 other stores.
 More luxury brands are said to be looking downtown. ''They are cautiously viewing how the trailblazers are doing,'' said Loren Baron, vice president of CB Richard Ellis. ''They would rather be a little late to the party and know things are going well than jump in a little too early.'' 
 Robert Futterman was less circumspect. ''If the Hermes store does $3,000 a square foot, you will see Prada, Gucci and Vuitton,'' he said. 
 But latecomers will not get the rental bargains that early birds did. Early in 2006, asking annual rents around Wall Street and Broad Street were in the $125-a-square-foot to $150-a-square-foot range, up from as low as $50 a square foot a year earlier. In some instances, they are now 2.5 times that, or $400 a square foot, according to Michael Hofmann, a retail specialist with Colliers International who negotiated the Wall Street lease for Thomas Pink. ''I've heard numbers as high as $600 for some of the spaces,'' he said. 
 By comparison, asking rents on Madison Avenue above 59th Street run from $600 to $800 a square foot, with some going as high as $1,200, brokers said. 
 Prime financial district rents are expected to keep going up. Desirable space is limited to a few blocks around Broad Street and Wall Street, and not all buildings are adaptable to retail use. Tiffany has carved a three-level store from a former bank; Thomas Pink's shop is slightly below street level in the former Brown Brothers Harriman headquarters. 
 For the moment, no one is worried about how dips in the financial markets might affect the market for $47,000 briefcases.
 ''There are going to be peaks and valleys on Wall Street, but even if the bonuses are 20 percent less, that's still $19 billion they will be giving out,'' Mr. Hofmann of Colliers said. ''They'll get by.''

HEADLINE: Lead, Follow or Move Aside

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
China today is entering a really delicate phase on the climate-energy issue -- the phase I like to call ''The Wal-Mart environmental moment.'' I wish the same could be said of America and President Bush. 
 The ''Wal-Mart environmental moment'' starts with the C.E.O. adopting a green branding strategy as a purely defensive, public relations, marketing move. Then an accident happens -- someone in the shipping department takes it seriously and comes up with a new way to package the latest product and saves $100,000. This gets the attention of the C.E.O., who turns to his P.R. adviser and says, ''Well, isn't that interesting? Get me a sustainability expert. Let's do this some more.'' 
 The company then hires a sustainability officer, and he starts showing how green design, manufacturing and materials can save money in other areas. Then the really smart C.E.O.'s realize they have to become their own C.E.O. -- chief energy officer -- and they start demanding that energy efficiency become core to everything the company does, from how its employees travel to how its products are manufactured. 
 That is the transition that Lee Scott, Wal-Mart's C.E.O., has presided over in the past few years. 
 Last July, Mr. Scott was visiting a Wal-Mart in Las Vegas on a day when the temperature was more than 100 degrees. He happened to notice that a Wal-Mart staple -- inexpensive Styrofoam coolers -- were not being promoted by the store's associates. As Andrew Ruben, Wal-Mart's vice president for sustainability, told me: ''Lee walked into the store and said, 'It's 105 degrees. Why aren't we selling any coolers?' The associates said, 'We don't want to sell Styrofoam coolers because of their impact on the environment.' So Lee called us afterwards and said: 'We're going to have to figure this out.' By that he meant innovation of a different kind of cooler'' that doesn't come from petroleum-based Styrofoam, which is not biodegradable and usually not recycled.
 Wal-Mart on Monday also announced a partnership with the Carbon Disclosure Project (C.D.P.) to measure the amount of energy used to create products throughout its supply chain -- many of which come from China. 
 Said C.D.P. Chief Executive Paul Dickinson: ''Wal-Mart will encourage its suppliers to measure and manage their greenhouse gas emissions, and ultimately reduce the total carbon footprint of Wal-Mart's indirect emissions. We look forward to other global corporations following Wal-Mart's lead.''
 China's leadership is not where Lee Scott is yet. Chinese officials still put their highest priority on growing G.D.P. -- their bottom line. But for the first time, the costs of this breakneck growth are becoming so obvious on China's air, glaciers and rivers that the leadership asked for briefings on global warming. Many Chinese mayors are looking to get clean-technology industries -- like wind turbines and solar -- started in their cities.
 At such a key time, if the U.S. government adopted a real carbon-reducing strategy, as California and Wal-Mart have, rather than the obfuscations of the Bush team, it would have a huge impact on China and only trigger more innovation in America.
 Mr. Bush will be convening his climate photo op -- oops, I mean ''conference'' -- in Washington tomorrow, which will include Chinese and Indian officials. But, as Rob Watson, the C.E.O. of EcoTech International, which works on environmental issues in China put it: ''The Chinese are not going to take anything we say seriously if we don't set an example ourselves.''
 David Moskovitz, who directs the Regulatory Assistance Project, a nonprofit that helps promote green policies in China, was even more blunt: ''The most frequent and difficult question we get in China with every policy initiative we put forward is: 'If it is so good, why aren't you doing it?' It's hard to answer -- and somewhat embarrassing. So we point to good examples that some American states, or cities, or companies are implementing -- but not to the federal government. We can't point to America.''
 Too bad. ''It was America which put environmentalism on the world's agenda in the 1970s and 
 '80s,'' recalled Glenn Prickett, a senior vice president for Conservation International. ''But since then, somehow, the wealthiest and most powerful country on the planet has gone to the back of the line.'' 
 Leadership is about ''follow me'' not ''after you.'' Getting our national climate regulations in order is necessary, but it will not be sufficient to move China. We have to show them what Wal-Mart is showing its competitors -- that green is not just right for the world, it is better, more profitable, more healthy, more innovative, more efficient, more successful. If Wal-Mart can lead, and California can lead, why can't America?

HEADLINE: To Keep Health Plans, Many Firms Shift Costs

BYLINE: By FRAN HAWTHORNE

 BODY:
HEALTH insurance premiums have been rising faster than the rate of inflation for years. Lack of health coverage has become a major issue in the presidential race. Yet somehow, 59 percent of small businesses provide some kind of insurance, according to a recent survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation. 
 True, that percentage was down from 68 percent just six years ago, says the foundation, a health policy research group that conducted the study of more than 3,100 employers. But many businesses still offer coverage, especially professional firms, mostly because of competition for employees, said Gary Claxton, a vice president at Kaiser. 
 How do they afford it? By cutting benefits and shifting more costs onto their workers. There are also newer insurance products geared to this market:
 HIGH-DEDUCTIBLE PLANS These are sometimes called ''consumer-driven plans,'' not because consumers are driving the demand, but because they must pay such a high share of the cost that, managers hope, they will use fewer services.
 The main cost is a superhigh deductible. Where a standard deductible might be $1,000 a person, it could be $2,500, or even $5,000, in these plans. That reduces the employer's share of annual premiums down to an average of $5,770 a person, about $1,000 lower than for other plans, according to a survey of nearly 3,000 companies by Mercer Human Resources Consulting last year. 
 Many employers then give back all or part of those savings to their staff by financing a secondary medical benefit. One is to put money into an employee-controlled health savings account, which works somewhat like a 401(k), with employees using the money for medical expenses rather than for retirement. 
 Alternatively, Scott Martin, president of a benefits consulting firm in New York City that specializes in small professional firms, prefers a health reimbursement account, because the company controls it and keeps any unused cash. Managers at small businesses, he said, probably have a good idea as to how many employees will need expensive care over the year, based on history. So they can figure out how much they need to increase the deductible and how much to put into the reimbursement account to lower their premiums and still save money. 
 ''The employer is taking on a calculated risk,'' Mr. Martin said.
 Employees may come out better with reimbursement accounts too. The Mercer survey found that deductibles tend to be about $300 lower per person and the benefits about $80 higher than in employee-run savings accounts.
 Because they favor healthier employees, all these high-deductible plans are controversial. Less than 10 percent of small businesses use them. 
 BARE-BONES COVERAGE One way to pay less is to cover less. Group Health Inc. of New York has a ''catastrophic care'' option that covers hospitalization only and no routine care, cutting premiums by about two-thirds. Or a company might pay for a limited number of routine checkups but not hospitalization. Other variations impose tight caps, perhaps paying a maximum of $50,000 a year, versus $1 million for a standard plan, said Kerry Finnegan, head of the small-employer group at Mercer's health and benefits unit. 
 ''Whether or not you would consider that health insurance is another question,'' said Mr. Claxton of Kaiser.
 VIRTUAL INSURANCE Even more minimalist is companies' paying nothing, leaving employees with the whole premium. Mr. Finnegan says companies can offer coverage through a payroll deduction and might be able to arrange group rates.
 PREVENTIVE-CARE PLANS ''If you really want to impact health care costs, you have to impact the health of the people you're insuring before they need medical care,'' said Jerry Ripperger, director of consumer health at Principal Financial Group, a Des Moines firm. But small companies have historically shunned so-called wellness plans, like smoking-cessation classes. 
 Yet the Mercer survey found more interest among small companies. Principal Financial has started pitching to this market with a plan that gives each employee 30 minutes of face-to-face counseling a year, for about $100 a person. 
 GOVERNMENT HELP States are trying various approaches to supplement the employer's role. 
 Through its Healthy NY program, New York subsidizes basic benefits at businesses with 50 or fewer eligible employees (within income limits) that have not offered coverage in the last 12 months. Tennessee has started a bare-bones plan called CoverTN, with a coverage cap of just $25,000 and the state paying one-third of the premium. California and Pennsylvania have proposed plans that would require most businesses either to offer health insurance or to pay into a state fund.
 Federally, Senator Michael B. Enzi, Republican of Wyoming, introduced a new version of his bill this summer that would let small businesses join insurance pools across state lines. To resolve one problem, he has agreed that if a majority of states require certain coverage, the pools would have to as well. Yet many health care experts doubt that the measure will get any further than its predecessors did.

HEADLINE: Columbia Still Reeling Over Visit

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON

 BODY:
Before Iran's president took the stage at Columbia University on Monday, the university's president, Lee C. Bollinger, sent out an early-morning e-mail message, calling on students and faculty ''to live up to the best of Columbia's traditions.'' Yesterday, many critics questioned whether Mr. Bollinger had met that test himself.
 On campus and in editorials across the nation, on political blogs and throughout academia, there was a sharp division of opinion about Mr. Bollinger's pointed introduction of the Iranian president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, as a man who exhibited ''all the signs of a petty and cruel dictator'' and whose denial of the Holocaust was ''either brazenly provocative or astonishingly uneducated.'' 
 Some said Mr. Bollinger's remarks were just the rebuke that Mr. Ahmadinejad deserved. Others said they were embarrassing and offensive. And there were still questions about whether Mr. Ahmadinejad should have been afforded a public platform at a prestigious university at all. 
 Rashid Khalidi, a professor of Arab studies and director of the Middle East Institute at Columbia, said, ''The tone from the host of an event was uncivil and uncalled for.
 ''The president of the university had every right to state his differences,'' he said. ''That was more than acceptable. But I believe it was embarrassing to the university, frankly, that they should decide to invite him and then treat him in this manner.''
 But Emily Steinberger, a sophomore who is a spokeswoman for LionPAC, a pro-Israel group at Columbia that had vehemently opposed Mr. Ahmadinejad's invitation, applauded Mr. Bollinger.
 ''President Bollinger was caustic in his criticism of Ahmadinejad, but anything else would have been inappropriate and troubling,'' said Ms. Steinberger, of Teaneck, N.J. ''Bollinger repeatedly said that his invitation in no way represented a condoning of Ahmadinejad's worldviews and policies, and yesterday he proved that.''
 Columbia's provost, Alan Brinkley, said the controversy ''was of a magnitude we hadn't seen before.'' 
 ''This really was the biggest event I've seen since I've started as provost,'' said Dr. Brinkley, who called it too early to judge the fallout for Columbia. 
 A university spokesman, David M. Stone, said that Mr. Bollinger, a legal scholar whose specialty is freedom of speech and freedom of the press, was not available to comment yesterday because he had a tight schedule. 
 A number of Iranian-born scholars -- experts about the Middle East who now live in the United States -- said they were shocked by Mr. Bollinger. 
 ''If I as a faculty member had done this in front of my president, I would been out the next day,'' said Ali Akbar Mahdi, a professor of sociology at Ohio Wesleyan University. Dr. Mahdai, who is a critic of Mr. Ahmadinejad's, added, ''I was taken aback.''
 So was Hamid Zangeneh, a professor of economics at Widener University in Pennsylvania and editor of The Journal of Iranian Research and Analysis. ''I was disgusted by the uncivilized behavior by President Bollinger,'' he said. ''I don't think it is becoming for the president of a university to engage in such behavior. It wasn't academic. It wasn't common sense. 
 ''Instead of behaving like a scholar, a president,'' he said, ''he behaved like a hooligan.'' 
 Some Jewish groups that were among the most vocal critics of the Ahmadinejad invitation applauded Mr. Bollinger, but remained critical of giving the Iranian president a stage. 
 ''He definitely came out swinging, with the whole world watching,'' said Elliot Mathias, director of Hasbara Fellowships, a pro-Israel organization, said of Mr. Bollinger. 
 ''I was glad to hear how strongly he condemned him,'' he added. ''But I don't think it makes up for the invitation. With someone who denies the Holocaust, who wants to destroy Israel and to turn the Western world into an Islamic caliphate, there is not room to have discussion. It is like discussing with the Ku Klux Klan whether blacks are inferior.''
 Abraham H. Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League, said Mr. Bollinger's speech was counterproductive. 
 ''If you invite someone, you have to be polite,'' he said. ''Ahmadinejad scored points, especially in their culture. If you permit an enemy to come into your home, you still treat him with dignity and respect. Therefore, we lost. The points that President Bollinger made were fine. But to close with insulting words almost undid everything he said before. It was not a good teaching experience.''
 Noah Feldman, a Harvard law professor who was a consultant to the Coalition Provisional Authority set up in Iraq after the ouster of Saddam Hussein, said he did not consider Mr. Bollinger's performance to be rude. 
 ''There are some issues where it is appropriate to be delicate and careful, and to use exaggerated politeness,'' he said. ''But there are some issues of such grave importance that being too polite to your guest is actually a betrayal of your beliefs. For Lee Bollinger, the Holocaust is one. I applaud him for that.''
 Gary G. Sick, a senior research scholar at Columbia's Middle East Institute, said he would be surprised if there were ''any long-term price'' for Mr. Bollinger's remarks. 
 ''A lot of people will be pleased that he came out swinging, that he was willing to tell like it is, to be tough,'' he said. ''I bet right now that his in-box has a lot more congratulatory cables than negative ones.''

HEADLINE: Planned City Rises Within a City in the Southwest

BYLINE: By LISA CHAMBERLAIN

DATELINE: ALBUQUERQUE 

 BODY:
A 25-square-mile stretch of flat acreage here with sweeping views of the Sandia Mountains -- said to be the largest tract of undeveloped land in the United States within one city's limits -- is being transformed into a master-planned community that may take 30 years to build.
 The development, called Mesa del Sol, will be a high-tech economic development center, and it is expected to become the site of 60,000 jobs, 38,000 homes and a town center. 
 It is being developed by a partnership of Forest City Enterprises, based in Cleveland, and Covington Capital Partners, based in Santa Monica, Calif. (Forest City Ratner, a subsidiary of Forest City Enterprises, is a partner in developing the new headquarters of The New York Times Company.)
 ''There should be a different word for this model of development,'' said Mark Lautman, director of economic development for Mesa del Sol. ''Developers with a five-year timeline come in, throw up some buildings, then get out. This is like building a city from scratch. We call this generational development.'' 
 Indeed, Mesa del Sol is different from the standard mixed-use project that has evolved over the last couple of decades. For starters, it is huge -- three times the size of Stapleton, Forest City's other well-known large-scale project, which is at the site of a former airport outside Denver.
 In addition, the development partnership, known as Forest City Covington New Mexico, has focused on job creation before building a single home. Most new mixed-used projects build homes and shopping first in hopes of attracting employers who will create jobs. 
 Instead, the first building completed here was for Advent Solar, a manufacturer of advanced solar cells based on technology developed at the nearby Sandia National Laboratories, a research lab affiliated with the Department of Energy. The 87,000-square-foot building was completed in February. About 200 people work at Advent, but the work force is expected to grow to 1,000. 
 The headliner of job creation at Mesa del Sol is Albuquerque Studios, one of the largest media production operations in the United States. Production companies have been lured to New Mexico by an extensive state-financed incentive program, which provides refunds on up to 25 percent of production expenditures subject to taxation, including labor. 
 The state also offers a zero-interest loan program for up to $15 million and further incentives to hire local people for advanced positions. 
 ''It's hard to break through the idea that only L.A. people can do this work,'' said Lisa Strout, director of the New Mexico film office, a position that is appointed by the governor. But because of the incentive package, she said, New Mexico now has ''the largest crew outside of the two coasts.''
 Nick Smerigan, chief operating officer of Albuquerque Studios, said the film industry was already in the state before the company arrived. ''We did our research and found that people were shooting in New Mexico and Albuquerque because of the incentive package, and because of the quick flight from L.A. and the year-round sunshine,'' Mr. Smerigan said. ''Our homework told us that there was no infrastructure to support all the shoots already going on.'' 
 To date, Albuquerque Studios has invested $74 million in building six sound stages ranging from 18,000 to 48,000 square feet, with two more in the works. The first production, ''In Plain Sight,'' a television series that will be broadcast on the USA network, began shooting last month.
 All of the completed studios are booked into January, said Mr. Smerigan, who estimated that at full capacity, 2,500 people would be employed by film and television productions and supporting companies.
 Sony Pictures Imageworks is one prominent company that has been lured to Mesa del Sol. Mr. Smerigan will oversee the building of a 100,000-square-foot center for the company, which specializes in visual effects and animation and which has worked on the ''Spider-Man'' films. Initially, Imageworks will employ 100 people, but the center will be designed to accommodate up to 1,000 workers. 
 The emphasis on job creation at Mesa del Sol can be directly attributed to the development deal itself, which Forest City Covington entered into with the state and the University of New Mexico (which jointly controlled the land). For every phase of construction, there is a job-creation goal, which cannot be met simply by having companies relocate from within Albuquerque. If a goal is not met, tax incentives for the next phase of development do not take effect.
 While job creation has come first, the first phase of housing, consisting of 550 homes, is about to break ground. The residential development and town center are being planned and designed by Peter Calthorpe, founder of Calthorpe Associates in Berkeley, Calif., who also did that work for Stapleton.
 As a leading proponent of New Urbanism, Mr. Calthorpe emphasizes traditional town planning and walkable streets. 
 ''I always design from three principles: diversity, human scale and sustainability,'' Mr. Calthorpe said. ''Diversity means serving a whole range of income and age groups, which means that you develop a large variety of housing types. Human scale means we should make these places around pedestrians and not around automobiles. Sustainability means the fundamental pieces of infrastructure, the design of the landscape, are all focused on climate and conservation.''
 For instance, he said, siting individual homes to take advantage of views can lend to inefficient land use. Instead, at Mesa del Sol public greenways radiate out from the town center and are placed to frame desert and mountain vistas. The intention is not only to democratize sightlines, but also to create incentives for people to intermingle along bike trails and pathways. 
 ''All the neighborhoods plug in along the greenways,'' said Mr. Calthorpe, who added that the strong Pueblo and Santa Fe-style architectural tradition of the Southwest will influence the housing styles. ''What's amazing about Mesa del Sol is that it is not a bedroom community. It will be truly mixed use from Day 1.''

HEADLINE: Mayor Plans Trip to Paris And London

BYLINE: By DIANE CARDWELL

 BODY:
It's off to London and Paris tomorrow for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who is flying two of his deputy mayors and several other associates to the European capitals, where he will talk to local officials about environmental and security measures. 
 Mr. Bloomberg will also give a speech in Blackpool, England, on Sunday about the economy at the invitation of the Conservative Party.
 It is the second official foreign trip the mayor has made in recent months. In April, he traveled to Mexico to study an antipoverty program.
 Mr. Bloomberg will be accompanied by two deputy mayors, Patricia E. Harris and Kevin Sheekey; a spokesman, John Gallagher; and an official photographer.
 The mayor will spend Friday night in Paris at the American Embassy. 
 Mr. Bloomberg plans to stay at his town house while in London, and will pay the travel expenses for himself and his delegation, including two staff members who are to travel overseas ahead of the mayor. Mr. Gallagher said that he and Mr. Bloomberg's other aides would stay in hotels in Paris and London, but that he was unsure which ones.
 President Nicolas Sarkozy invited Mr. Bloomberg to visit Paris, Mr. Gallagher said, but the mayor suggested this week that since he would see the president in New York, he would not meet with him in Paris.
 In France, Mr. Bloomberg plans to meet with officials to discuss their environmental efforts. 
 In London, he plans to tour parts of the bus system and visit the so-called Ring of Steel, the extensive web of cameras, roadblocks and other security features that circle the city and are designed to combat terrorism. The mayor wants to establish a similar security system in Lower Manhattan.
 Mr. Bloomberg was to have meetings with Mayor Ken Livingstone of London and other officials on Monday.

HEADLINE: Utah Mine Country, After Disaster, Tells Panel It Fears Overregulation

BYLINE: By DAN FROSCH

DATELINE: HUNTINGTON, Utah, Sept. 25 

 BODY:
With quiet voices, their words sometimes husky with emotion, residents of Utah coal country told a state panel on Tuesday that they feared the mines would be overwhelmed by new safety rules after a fatal accident last month.
 ''We've got the right laws in place right now that I think can take care of safety,'' Brad Timothy, a longtime miner, said. 
 Mr. Timothy and 30 others gathered at the Huntington Elementary School gymnasium for the second hearing of the new Mine Safety Commission. 
 Gov. Jon Huntsman Jr. formed the panel to investigate the state's role in mine safety after the fatal collapse at the Crandall Canyon Mine near here killed six miners and three rescue workers. 
 Mr. Huntsman and commission members have suggested that Utah should be more active in regulating its 13 coal mines. They are now overseen by just the Federal Mine Safety and Health Administration. 
 Miners at the hearing viewed the commission with suspicion, and panel members spent considerable time reassuring residents that the state was not bent on closing the mines. 
 ''We are not going to make more rules,'' said Mayor Hilary Gordon of Huntington, a member of the commission. ''We want to keep the mining industry strong.''
 Nearly two months after the Crandall Canyon collapse, the main street of this tiny town is quiet, no longer flooded with news media, government vehicles and makeshift memorials. The lone sign that something terrible once occurred is a poster at a gasoline station saying, ''We will never forget.''
 Without hesitation, just about all of those in attendance said more mine regulation would ruin their livelihoods. 
 ''I don't want to see their jobs go down the drain,'' said Lee Cratsenburg, 59, who worked for 19 years in mines. ''I think the safety regulations should be left.''
 Ms. Cratsenburg's brother Dale Black was one of the rescue workers killed at Crandall Canyon. She said if existing regulations had been met there, ''I don't think the lives would have been lost.'' 
 A panel member, Dennis O'Dell, a mine safety official for the United Mine Workers of America, disputed the notion that the state did not have a role. He said that Utah should consider supplementing the federal inspections, that there was a national shortage of federal safety specialists and that the agency had fallen behind on inspections. 
 ''A large number of mines are not getting the inspections,'' Mr. O'Dell said. ''In some cases, M.S.H.A.'s falling behind are affecting the health and safety of the miners. The state might be able to play some role to help.'' 
 Gary D. Kofford, an Emery County commissioner, warned that any actions the commission took would affect the local economy. 
 ''Let us do our jobs,'' Mr. Kofford said. ''Don't shut any more mines down. Don't interfere.'' 
 Industry officials were also hesitant to endorse a separate state regulatory system, saying the federal agency already conducted frequent and aggressive inspections that kept mines safe. 
 ''I don't think anyone on this commission understands how many inspections M.S.H.A. does,'' said Ray Bridge, a safety manager for the Dugout Canyon Mine near Price. ''In our opinion, they do a very thorough job.'' 
 Mr. Bridge said his mine was subject to nearly constant inspections that looked into all aspects of the mine, including safety, noise levels and electrical equipment. He said a total of 245 federal inspectors had inspected Dugout Canyon throughout this year. 
 The prevailing sentiment was that nothing could have prevented the Crandall Canyon disaster and that any state intervention might worsen problems. 
 ''This event was an anomaly and could not have been predicted,'' said Joe Fielder, a longtime miner involved in the Crandall Canyon rescue effort. ''This disaster was not the result of poor training or improper mine procedures.'' 
 On a break from the hearing, Mr. O'Dell wandered over to a corner of the gymnasium. A coal miner, he conceded that he was frustrated with the sense that the local mines were in jeopardy and called accusations that the mines were already overregulated preposterous. 
 ''The most precious resource in the mines,'' he told the panel, ''is the miner, not the coal.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Courts the Visiting President of Turkmenistan

BYLINE: By DAVID L. STERN

DATELINE: ALMATY, Kazakhstan, Sept. 25 

 BODY:
American officials, striving to weaken the grip of Gazprom, Russia's state-owned energy monopoly, in Central Asia, are courting the president of Turkmenistan on his first visit to the United States.
 The visit by Gurbanguly Berdymukhammedov, the first by a Turkmen president since 1998, included a meeting Tuesday with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice at the United Nations and on Wednesday will revolve around the opening of the General Assembly.
 American officials said they wanted Mr. Berdymukhammedov to understand that he had other options for developing his country's extensive natural gas deposits and for shipping the fuel to market. 
 The United States wants to encourage the development of hydrocarbon sources outside the Middle East while offering Europeans an alternative to Gazprom, which provides nearly a quarter of the Continent's gas supply.
 Russia and more recently China have received the bulk of natural gas exports from Turkmenistan, a former Soviet republic. Russia buys 50 billion cubic meters of gas a year at below-market prices. China has signed a development agreement for one of Turkmenistan's most promising gas fields and will get 30 billion cubic meters, or 1.1 trillion cubic feet of gas, annually over 30 years.
 Russia controls all export routes for Turkmen natural gas and plans to expand its main northern pipeline to double its purchases.
 An American official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment, said: ''No one is trying to push Gazprom out of the Caspian -- that's impossible. What we want is for this totally dysfunctional system to change, where Gazprom can practically dictate the price for gas on the Turkmen end and sells it for nearly three times that amount in Europe.''
 The official said he expected Russia still to receive most of Turkmen natural gas. But potentially rich fields in Turkmenistan's sector of the Caspian Sea could yield reserves to be shipped westward through an undersea pipeline to Turkey.
 From there, gas could enter a proposed Nabucco pipeline to Eastern Europe or another gas pipeline through Greece.
 The size of Turkmenistan's gas reserves is secret. But analysts and Western officials say that the country may have at least three trillion cubic meters.
 Some analysts are cautious. They say that at that level, Turkmenistan would have just enough to fulfill its Russian and Chinese contracts. Beyond that, legal and economic obstacles facing the Caspian pipeline make it a project for the medium to distant future.
 ''People are getting too far ahead of themselves,'' said Jonathan Stern, an analyst at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies in Britain. ''We need to see what Turkmenistan's reserves are and where they are. Then we can start talking about projects.''
 Mr. Berdymukhammedov, a former health minister and the dentist of the country's previous ruler, Saparmurat Niyazov, was an unexpected choice to lead Turkmenistan, a land of some 5.4 million, after Mr. Niyazov died last year.
 Under Mr. Niyazov, Turkmenistan was among the world's most insular countries. Mr. Berdymukhammedov, since taking over in February, has begun to open it to outside influences.
 His political actions have raised hopes among Western oil companies and officials that a move toward market economics may not be far behind. Representatives of ConocoPhillips, Chevron, Royal Dutch Shell and BP, among others, have met with the Turkmen leader in the capital, Ashgabat, hoping to bolster their reserves and to tap non-OPEC energy sources.
 The British energy minister, Malcolm Wicks, in a visit to the region last week, offered to buy Turkmen natural gas at market prices. Mr. Berdymukhammedov said Turkmenistan was willing to sell gas to Europe.

HEADLINE: New Series: Women Test Mettle, And Metal

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY

 BODY:
When future anthropologists study prime-time television at the dawn of the 21st century, they will inevitably have to grapple with one gnawing question: What was so bad about Lindsay Wagner?
 NBC has remade ''The Bionic Woman'' (and lost the article in the title) almost as a rebuke to the original 1970s show that starred Ms. Wagner as Jaime Sommers, a professional tennis player who, after a sky-diving accident, receives artificial body parts that give her superhuman abilities. The new $6 million woman -- though the bionic program, like any other military project today, would be measured as a percentage of the total economy, and, adjusted for inflation and changes in the gross domestic product, come in at about $50 million -- is played by Michelle Ryan as a sullen bartender turned cyborg. Jaime 2.0 wakes up from a car crash with new legs, a new arm, a new ear and a new eye and nary a scratch on her face, and is not the least bit grateful. 
 NBC's show, which is more about fembot martial arts and slick ''Matrix''-ish special effects than about character development, is oriented toward young male viewers. There is no such excuse for ABC's ''Private Practice,'' a spinoff of ''Grey's Anatomy,'' which is also on tonight and supposedly offers a postfeminist sensibility that is more playful and palatable than the overearnest women's lib of the Lindsay Wagner generation. 
 Dr. Addison Forbes Montgomery (Kate Walsh), a top-notch surgeon, has left Seattle to heal her broken heart in Los Angeles, where her best friend has founded a private wellness clinic. She is no longer surrounded by the kind of strong, tough, ambitious surgeons played by Sandra Oh and Chandra Wilson. Instead her new colleagues collectively offer one of the most depressing portrayals of the female condition since ''The Bell Jar.'' 
 Or worse: The premiere showcases seven different women, doctors and their patients, in various states of anger, insecurity and neediness. It's like a Hogarth engraving of the seven stages of womanly despair, ''A Surgeon's Progress.'' 
 Both shows suggest that the easiest way to make a female protagonist likable is to dumb her down with self-doubt. The heroine of ''Bionic Woman'' starts out as a single, pregnant bartender who doesn't understand what her scientist boyfriend sees in her. On ''Private Practice'' Addison is a leading neonatal specialist who freaks out, in front of her patient's father, when she has to perform an emergency Caesarean in a clinic, not a fully equipped hospital.
 ''Bionic Woman'' is dark, not polyester bright, but it isn't much better than the original at depicting running at superspeed. The new series is filmed in the sleek, washed-out palette that is currently so fashionable on shows like ''Heroes'' and ''Prison Break.'' ''Bionic Woman'' also follows the current fad for serialized confusion: There is a mysterious conspiracy surrounding the bio-military experiments at a research center that keeps the plot murky and drives characters to speak in terse, enigmatic undertones. 
 Jaime's boyfriend, Will Anthros (Chris Bowers), is a bionics expert and surgeon who performs a top-secret experimental operation to save her life -- without permission from his superiors, who include a stern taskmaster, Jonas Bledsoe (Miguel Ferrer).
 Jaime discovers that she is not the first female cyborg or even the most unpleasant. Sarah Corvus (Katee Sackhoff), a pasty platinum blonde who looks a little like Courtney Love on steroids, was the earliest prototype, and designed to serve as a soldier. Sarah appears to have morphed into a rogue agent and lurks in the shadows, stalking and attacking people, including Jaime. Sarah should be dead but isn't. When she isn't trying to kill former associates, even she has a needy side: ''Tell me you love me,'' she repeatedly implores men.
 All the women on ''Private Practice'' are looking for love, and they are all making a mess of it. Addison's old friend Naomi Bennett (Audra McDonald) is a fertility specialist whose husband, a partner in the clinic, has moved out. Naomi can barely keep her rage under wraps at the office; at home she locks herself in the bathroom with an entire cake and tearfully scarfs it down. 
 Their other female colleague is a psychiatrist, Dr. Violet Turner (Amy Brenneman), who between patients stalks her former boyfriend, who is married to someone else. And so on. The fact that the men in the practice are heels isn't much consolation. 
 Viewers don't need to be feminists to yearn to turn the clock back 30 years to when Ms. magazine had half a million readers, the Equal Rights Amendment seemed on the brink of ratification, and Ms. Wagner played an accomplished professional who was courteous, well balanced and actually seemed to like herself.

HEADLINE: Bush, at U.N., Announces Stricter Burmese Sanctions

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS; David M. Herszenhorn contributed reporting from Washington.

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 25 

 BODY:
President Bush, calling on countries to live up to freedoms and rights promised by the United Nations almost six decades ago, on Tuesday announced tighter sanctions on Myanmar and denounced the governments of Belarus, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria and Zimbabwe as ''brutal regimes'' that should be confronted for their abuses.
 In contrast to previous addresses here, he barely mentioned the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan except to say that the international community should do more to support those countries. Nor did he make a reference to one of his administration's biggest foreign-policy concerns: Iran's nuclear program. 
 Mr. Bush made his remarks at the opening of the 62nd session of the General Assembly, an annual gathering that was at points stormy and theatrical. Cuba's foreign minister walked out of the president's speech, protesters rallied outside with ''Arrest Bush'' signs and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Iran's president, rebutted most of what Mr. Bush said.
 Mr. Bush used his most forceful language to denounce countries that the United States publicly ranks among the least democratic. He also called on members of the United Nations to do more to support foundling democracies, later meeting with the leaders of several of them, including Georgia, Botswana, Afghanistan and Honduras.
 ''Every civilized nation also has a responsibility to stand up for the people suffering under dictatorship,'' Mr. Bush said.
 White House officials previewing the president's remarks had suggested that he would provide a more nuanced, expansive view of freedom, saying that political freedoms were no less important that freedom from disease, illiteracy or poverty. Mr. Bush's starkest remarks, however, focused on the seven governments he lumped together as a group of unfriendly states, similar to how he once famously linked Iran, Iraq and North Korea as an ''axis of evil.''
 In the case of Myanmar, formerly Burma, Mr. Bush excoriated the country's military government, which in the past few weeks has faced the most extensive public protests in nearly two decades.
 He outlined a tightening of economic sanctions in place since 1997 to aim at specific individuals for the first time. He also announced a ban on visas of those ''responsible for the most egregious violations of human rights'' and their families. ''Basic freedoms of speech, assembly and worship are severely restricted,'' Mr. Bush said. ''Ethnic minorities are persecuted. Forced child labor, human trafficking and rape are common.''
 The Treasury Department will soon compile a list of people who will be affected by the economic sanctions, while the State Department will draw up a list of those barred from traveling to the United States. Mr. Bush announced the sanctions as weeks of protests in Myanmar appeared to be building toward a confrontation with the authorities, who declared a curfew only hours after Mr. Bush spoke.
 Stephen J. Hadley, the national security adviser, said the intention was to get the government there to ''understand that there is a time now for a political transition'' and to send a warning not to suppress the protests harshly.
 Mr. Bush's audience included representatives of some of the countries he singled out for criticism, including Mr. Ahmadinejad, who listened without outward reaction.
 Cuba's delegation walked out after Mr. Bush declared that in Cuba ''the long rule of a cruel dictator is nearing its end.''
 He criticized the government of Robert G. Mugabe of Zimbabwe -- the only world leader he mentioned by name -- for ''an assault on its people and an affront to the principles'' of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
 Mr. Bush referred repeatedly to the declaration, citing its first article, ''All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights,'' as well as the 23rd, 25th and 26th articles, which call for access to employment, health care and education.
 The declaration, a nonbinding resolution that was negotiated in 1948, calls on countries to protect a wide array of rights, including freedom of speech, assembly and religion, while prohibiting slavery, torture and arbitrary detention.
 Mr. Bush also criticized the United Nations, singling out the Human Rights Council, a body created last year after the United States and others objected that the previous council, the Commission on Human Rights, often included countries criticized for their human rights records.
 Mr. Bush complained that the new council, which the United States also voted against, had since its creation voted exclusively on resolutions criticizing Israel. Michael Kozak, an aide on the National Security Council, later said the Council had voted against Israel 13 times.
 ''This body has been silent on repression by regimes from Havana to Caracas to Pyongyang and Tehran, while focusing its criticism excessively on Israel,'' Mr. Bush said.
 He later attended a meeting of the Security Council convened to debate peacekeeping in Africa generally and the violence in Darfur specifically. He welcomed the African Union's contribution to a peacekeeping mission in Sudan, but warned that ''7,000 troops is not enough, if you believe what's taking place on the ground is genocide.''
 ''Maybe some don't think it's genocide, but if you've been raped, you think it's -- your human rights have been violated,'' he said, gesturing forcefully. ''If you're mercilessly killed by roaming bands, you know it's genocide. And the fundamental question is, are we, the free world, willing to do more?''
 In Washington, the House approved a bill that would tighten economic sanctions on Iran by ending the administration's ability to waive penalties on foreign companies that violate federal rules by investing $20 million or more in Iran's energy industry. 
 The bill, sponsored by Representative Tom Lantos, Democrat of California and chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, passed by an overwhelming margin of 397 to 16.

HEADLINE: House Panel Approves A Trade Pact With Peru

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 25 

 BODY:
A trade pact between the United States and Peru won bipartisan support in a crucial Congressional committee Tuesday, signaling that some Democrats will be receptive to new trade deals as long as they call on other nations to adhere to international labor and environmental standards.
 The action, a voice vote in the House Ways and Means Committee, clears the way for approval of the Peru deal by Congress this fall, with most Republicans and perhaps a minority of the Democrats supporting it, Congressional aides said. The Senate Finance Committee approved the pact on Friday. 
 The vote Tuesday was a victory for the Bush administration and Representative Charles B. Rangel, the New York Democrat who is chairman of the Ways and Means panel. Mr. Rangel argued, against the opposition of many Democrats, that well-devised trade deals can benefit American workers and the economy.
 Mr. Rangel traveled to Peru in August to win assurances from the Peruvian leadership that they would fully carry out the labor and environmental clauses of the trade deal, which were written in cooperation with the A.F.L.-C.I.O.
 ''Today is a very special day in my legislative career,'' Mr. Rangel said. But he noted that he may not be able to win over most of his party, adding, ''Our membership on this committee means that we will have to do things that at times will not be as popular as we would like them to be.'' 
 Despite the boost for the Peru deal, prospects for other pending trade deals with Panama, Colombia and South Korea remain clouded by continuing disagreements that have to be resolved before the deals can be approved.
 Democrats regained control of Congress last year after a campaign in which many candidates promised to block future trade deals. But the Bush administration's agreement last May to add labor and environmental provisions to the Peru deal and other pending trade pacts changed the political equation on Capitol Hill.
 In consenting to move the Peru deal with Mr. Rangel, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Senate majority leader, reflected the internal pressure inside the Democratic caucus since the Clinton presidency.
 While many rank-and-file Democrats fear that trade deals erode American jobs, Democratic leaders have developed close ties with Wall Street and with many high technology and industrial companies that rely on trade agreements to expand their markets overseas.
 The hope of pro-trade lawmakers in both parties is that the environmental and labor provisions become a template applied to all trade deals, including those negotiated by a future Republican or Democratic president.
 For now, the administration simply hopes that the provisions will make a dent in protectionist sentiment in the current Congress and lure a sizable number of Democrats to other deals before President Bush leaves office next year.
 ''This is another indication that the Bush administration and Congress can find a way to do the right thing for the American people, the U.S. economy and our key allies in the region,'' said Susan C. Schwab, the United States trade representative.
 Opponents of the administration's trade policies said that they would continue to battle the Peru deal and that other pending trade agreements would have a much tougher time because of particular concerns with each of them.
 A Panama deal may have the best chance of passage. But Democratic leaders said that the Colombia deal cannot be considered until Colombia does more to end human rights abuses, especially against workers trying to organize. And they said South Korea must take further steps to open its market to American beef, autos and auto parts.
 While its symbolic value is high, by itself the Peru vote had little economic significance. Total two-way trade between Peru and the United States was $8.8 billion in 2006, less than half a percent of the total trade volume between the United States and the rest of the world.
 The new deal, the administration says, will ensure Peru's continued access to American markets while leading to duty-free access overseas for American farm products, construction equipment, auto parts and high-technology goods.
 On the other side, critics of the deal say that it represents an extension of Nafta, the North American trade deal worked out in the early 1990s with Mexico and Canada, and that it will cost American jobs, erode American food safety and inspection standards and bar poor countries from making or importing generic drugs.
 Lori Wallach, director of Global Trade Watch division of Public Citizen, assailed the Peru vote as bad policy and politics. ''This is especially incomprehensible,'' she said, ''after many of the freshman Democrats, who tipped the balance of power in Congress, were elected by focusing on ending more-of-the-same trade policies.''

HEADLINE: Reborn In the U.S.A.

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES
 AT first blush, Bread Denim, a one-year-old clothing maker in this city's gritty industrial district, appears to be a flash in the fashion pan, a fledgling, trend-riding company without a future. 
 Its headquarters consist of two desks, a conference table and a clothing rack, all squeezed behind a partition in an office it shares with a larger company. It has just three employees. 
 Its sure-fire business plan? To manufacture $200 vintage-washed, 100 percent organic cotton jeans -- not in Asia or Latin America, where the vast majority of jeans are made, but in downtown Los Angeles. 
 ''We went into this knowing we could fail,'' said Jason Ferro, Bread's founder. 
 But the story of Bread Denim -- which is, in broad strokes, the story of the designer denim industry -- is more reassuring than it seems. Mr. Ferro is no novice. He has a decade of experience designing jeans at Guess, Levi's and Abercrombie & Fitch. 
 The reason his staff is so skeletal is that he contracts much of the work to a small army of renowned denim experts with offices nearby. The Los Angeles company that stitches together Bread's jeans once sewed jeans for Guess and Calvin Klein. And the laundry house that washes and sands his denim used to do the same for Pepe Jeans and Tommy Hilfiger. 
 Everything about the luxury denim industry, which began taking root here in 2000, has a fly-by-night feel, from the esoteric brand names -- Antik, Nudie, Evisu, Monarch -- to the sky-high prices, which have hit $1,000 a pair. But the new business is firmly rooted in this city's rich blue-jean past, tapping into a vast network of experienced designers, sewers, laundry houses and fabric importers who gave birth to the first generation of designer denim in the late 1970s and '80s -- brands like Guess and Hilfiger -- only to fall idle when such companies moved much of their manufacturing to China and Latin America. 
 Premium denim companies like Bread, far from dropping from the sky, picked up the pieces and rejiggered and retooled that ailing industry to become a $400 million economy that sustains an estimated 100 companies in Los Angeles. 
 It can be argued, as it often is in Los Angeles, that the premium denim business could not have happened anywhere else. ''All the infrastructure was in place,'' said Mr. Ferro, 35. ''We just used it for something new.''
 And something more expensive.
 Los Angeles has quickly become the Silicon Valley of high-priced denim, with each step in the painstaking process of putting together a $200, $300 or more costly pair of jeans performed a few blocks from the next. 
 Los Angeles offered something else crucial for expensive denim companies: celebrities. One by one, actresses like Cameron Diaz and Paris Hilton slapped on a pair of $200 jeans, which ran in photographs across the country, catapulting unknown brands into the spotlight. (The headquarters of the denim maker 7 for All Mankind are peppered with such photos.)
 Despite rumors of a luxury denim bubble, the business shows few signs of slowing down. In 2007, denim priced at more than $100 a pair, much of it produced here in Los Angeles, was the fastest-growing category of jeans in department stores. Men's premium denim sales rose 45 percent and women's 24 percent, according to NPD Group, a market research firm, while sales of jeans under $50 fell for both sexes. 
 Bread is one beneficiary: its denim sits on shelves at Bloomingdale's, Fred Segal and Searle. ''It is a good start,'' said Mr. Ferro, who estimates that he has invested about $1 million in the business and hopes that it will be profitable within two years. 
 Denim's reverse commute across the Pacific Ocean is an anomaly in this era of globalization. Few, if any, American manufacturing industries leave for countries where labor is cheaper and then return to the United States. 
 But that is exactly what has happened with denim -- not, as is widely believed, because a ''Made in the U.S.A.'' tag adds cachet to an article of clothing but because it is actually easier, and often cheaper, for a small luxury company to make denim in the United States than abroad. 
 Companies like Bread cannot afford the minimum-order requirements from the foreign factories that now make jeans for giants like Levi's and Wrangler -- or the office space, staff and international travel needed to oversee such a process.
 But in Los Angeles, they found companies willing to work with small denim makers -- not out of charity, but because the denim industry, like much of the domestic clothing economy, was experiencing a wrenching transformation. 
 The case of Caitac Garment Processing is instructive. The company started in 1991, stone-washing denim for Guess, Gap and Abercrombie & Fitch. Because of their size, these clothing companies placed enormous orders with Caitac, for hundreds of thousands of jeans a year. By 2000, however, several of Caitac's biggest customers had moved the bulk of their manufacturing to Mexico, Guatemala and El Salvador, where cheap labor improved their profits.
 The rise of premium denim was a case of good timing for Caitac. By the late 1990s, a handful of tiny denim makers, with names like Earl and 7, began popping up in the Los Angeles area. The jeans they made consisted of the same five-pocket design as Levi's -- two in the back, three in the front (with one for loose change) -- but everything else was different. These designers insisted on using the finest denim, imported from Japan and Italy, which incorporated stretch material that hugged the hip, and they required every element to be manufactured by hand, a far more elaborate wash process and abundant hard-to-achieve details. 
 Caitac was used to far less labor-intensive work, but it needed new clients to replace what it had lost. So it began working with premium denim companies to develop an entirely new set of technologies. In 2000, Caitac considered sandblasting machines, used to age denim with a high-pressure blast of stone, to be superior technology. 
 Today, those machines sit idle. ''Before premium denim arrived, if you wanted a distressed look, you used these,'' said Muneyuki Ishii, Caitac's factory manager here. ''The new denim companies wanted different machines for everything.'' 
 For example, to create ''whiskers,'' or the horizontal lines of discoloration that run across the thighs, Caitac made balloons that inflate and deflate, mimicking legs inside a pair of jeans, so employees can sand the denim by hand. 
 For three-dimensional whiskers, or permanent folds in the denim, Caitac ordered a fast-hardening resin, which is ironed into the jeans and then baked in an oven. To artificially age the denim, it experimented with dozens of chemicals, settling on a potassium spray that leaves a yellow-colored worn look. 
 These technologies take months, if not years, to develop. An emerging trend calls for a shiny, black plastic coating on denim. Caitac has spent three frustrating months perfecting the process so that the coating does not rub off -- onto chairs, walls and hands. The solution has been to bake the coating in an oven and apply a high-pressure blast to blend it into the denim. 
 The perils of all this washing, spraying, sanding and baking on denim are important. When the first pairs of premium denim reached stores, hundreds of customers complained that kneecaps and back pockets broke down soon after purchase. Now, companies like Caitac have elaborate quality-control laboratories to test for such flaws.
 Orders from small companies did not make up the business Caitac lost when the Levi's and Guesses of the world shipped their manufacturing abroad. But the payoff has been substantial. Caitac charges prices for the hand-sanding and complex chemical washes requested by premium denim makers far higher than it did for stone washing in the '90s. Washes for premium denim companies can run $30 a pair, compared with prices as low as $2 for traditional jeans. 
 And Caitac has become a favorite of the new industry, used by 7 for All Mankind, True Religion, Earnest Sewn, Agave and James Jeans. And even Levi's. When Levi's introduced a premium denim line several years ago, called Capital E, to compete with the upstarts in Los Angeles, it turned to Caitac. Levi's now occupies a small office inside Caitac's headquarters. 
 Companies like Caitac form the backbone of the industry, because few denim makers can afford to sew, wash or package their own jeans. Even the industry's biggest players, like 7 for All Mankind and Paper Denim & Cloth, contract much of their labor, which helps explain why premium denim has a premium price.
 ''We don't make anything here,'' said Rick Crane, the president of sales and marketing for 7, as he walked down the halls of the company's office. The company relies on six firms for sewing and seven for washing -- and even leases space on its property to one of them, U.S. Garment, whose owner used to wash jeans for Guess and Calvin Klein but left the business when those companies moved manufacturing offshore. (In another example of the new denim industry reviving the old, 7 financed U.S. Garment through a 50-50 partnership.) 
 Michael Cassel is a co-owner of Stronghold, a new denim company that sells bespoke jeans for up to $1,200 a pair. He employs six sewers but contracts ''everything else out,'' he said. On a given day, he will crisscross Los Angeles five times to pick up jeans from one contractor and deliver them to the next. 
 On a recent Wednesday, with a reporter in tow, he picked up a dozen pairs of jeans from All American Wash, a tiny laundry house begun by an entrepreneur who used to wash for Guess. He checked in on Sample Express, a tiny company that stitches together prototypes of jeans -- often an order of just one or two pairs -- that Stronghold shows buyers at department stores and boutiques to gauge interest. 
 And he dropped off a small bag of jeans at Santa Fe Finishing, a company that specializes in the final stage of clothing production: inspecting garments for flaws, repairing them, ironing them and packaging them for delivery. 
 Barry Forman, president of Santa Fe Finishing, says the premium denim industry makes up a small part of his business. Indeed, on this day, Mr. Cassel dropped off no more than 10 pairs of jeans for Mr. Forman's employees to inspect. 
 Why would Mr. Forman bother with such a small client? The big denim companies, ''can live without me,'' he said. He looked at Mr. Cassel, standing next to him on the factory floor. ''But he can't.''

HEADLINE: Iran President Vows to Ignore U.N. Measures

BYLINE: By WARREN HOGE; David Sanger contributed reporting.

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 25 

 BODY:
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the president of Iran, said Tuesday that he considered the dispute over his country's nuclear program ''closed'' and that Iran would disregard the resolutions of the Security Council, which he said was dominated by ''arrogant powers.''
 In a rambling and defiant 40-minute speech to the opening session of the General Assembly, he said Iran would from now on consider the nuclear issue not a ''political'' one for the Security Council, but a ''technical'' one to be decided by the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations' nuclear watchdog.
 Mr. Ahmadinejad's assertion that the matter belonged with the nuclear agency indicated his preference to work with Mohamed ElBaradei, its director. 
 Dr. ElBaradei has been at odds with Washington, and some European powers, who have accused him of meddling in the diplomacy by seeking separate accords with Iran, and in their eyes undercutting the Security Council resolutions. 
 ''Today because of the resistance of the Iranian nation, the issue is back to the agency, and I officially announce that in our opinion, the nuclear issue of Iran is now closed and has turned into an ordinary agency matter,'' Mr. Ahmadinejad said. A senior Bush administration official said after the address that the only person who thought that the issue was closed was Mr. Ahmadinejad. 
 As the Iranian president moved to speak, the United States delegation left, leaving only a note-taker to listen to the speech, which occurred just hours after President Bush had spoken from the same podium about the need for nations to live up to the rights guaranteed by the United Nations. 
 In a barely disguised barb, Mr. Ahmadinejad asserted, ''Unfortunately human rights are being extensively violated by certain powers, especially by those who pretend to be their exclusive advocates.''
 Mr. Ahmadinejad's declaration that the nuclear issue was closed comes just as the Bush administration is seeking to turn up the pressure on the country, both through the United Nations Security Council and in concert with European powers.
 ''In the last two years,'' the Iranian president said, ''abusing the Security Council, the arrogant powers have repeatedly accused Iran and even made military threats and imposed illegal sanctions against it.''
 In recent weeks, American and French officials have described an emerging strategy of broadening the number of banks, mostly in Europe, that have refused to lend new capital to Iran, making it difficult for the country to invest in new oil facilities or other infrastructure. 
 ''We want more banks, and now suppliers, to assess the risk'' of dealing with Iran, Stephen J. Hadley, President Bush's national security adviser, said in a meeting on Tuesday with editors and reporters of The New York Times. 
 The issue now, he said, is ''at what point the regime, or elements of the regime, say 'this policy is taking us into a ditch.'''
 Administration officials insist that despite Mr. Ahmadinejad's high profile in New York this week, he is being marginalized at home. If true, it makes it hard to assess whether he was speaking for the rest of the Iranian leadership with his declaration.
 Only last month, Iran's leaders reached an agreement with Dr. ElBaradei to answer questions that nuclear inspectors have been raising for years about possible connections between Iran's nuclear program and military projects. Inspectors are in Iran this week, seeking further answers to questions that Iran has refused to discuss.
 But even if Iran answers all the outstanding questions, it could still be in violation of the Security Council resolutions. Those resolutions call on the country to cease enriching uranium.
 The enrichment has continued, though not yet on a scale large enough to produce a bomb's worth of material in the near future. Mr. Hadley refused to speculate on how much time the United States and its allies had to stop the program before Iran had enough material to manufacture a weapon.
 Mr. Ahmadinejad, as he has in the past, argued that Iran's nuclear program was solely for civilian purposes and fell within the legal requirements of the atomic energy agency. 
 The Security Council powers believe that Iran's real purpose is to build nuclear weapons, and it has backed up that conviction with two resolutions and economic sanctions against the Tehran government.
 Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States, the permanent members of the Security Council, have been holding meetings in various capitals this fall to see if sterner measures are needed to gain compliance.
 France's president, Nicolas Sarkozy, told the General Assembly in a speech earlier Tuesday that allowing Iran to build a bomb would be an ''unacceptable risk to stability in the region and in the world.''
 He said the Security Council should not relax its guard while it continued to negotiate with Tehran. ''Firmness and dialogue go hand in hand,'' he said. ''And I weigh my words carefully.'' 
 To that, Mr. Ahmadinejad had his own reply. ''The decisions by the United States and France are not important,'' he said during his address. ''What is important is that our nuclear program is within the rules of the I.A.E.A. and our program as such will continue.''
 Without mentioning the United States by name, Mr. Ahmadinejad used his speech to carry out a full-scale assault on the country as power-mad and godless. He said its leaders ''openly abandon morality'' and act with ''lewdness, selfishness, enmity and imposition in place of justice, love, affection and honesty.''
 ''Certain powers,'' he said in a thinly veiled reference to Washington, were ''setting up secret prisons, abducting persons, trials and secret punishments without any regard to due process, extensive tapping of telephone conversations, intercepting private mail.''
 In answer to questions at a news conference about having proposed the extinction of Israel, he said he was instead proposing a referendum of all people living in the Palestinian territories and Israel, which he referred to as the ''illegal Zionist regime'' to see what their choice of country would be.
 He said countries had been eliminated peaceably before, and he cited the case of the Soviet Union. 
 ''What befell the Soviet Union?'' he said. ''It disappeared, but was it done through war? No. It was through the voice of the people.''
 Asked by an Israeli journalist about the possibility that Iran was helping Syria acquire nuclear knowledge, he said, ''Next question.''
 Mr. Ahmadinejad was not alone in attacking the United States. So did Daniel Ortega, the president of Nicaragua. Saying that Washington's actions against Iran were like those of ''God telling people what is good and bad,'' he proposed that the countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America join him in a march against the forces of ''global capitalist imperialism.''
 Late Tuesday, Hugo Chavez, the outspoken Venezuelan president who called Mr. Bush a devil last year from the General Assembly podium, announced in Caracas that he was no longer planning to come to New York to deliver his country's speech on Wednesday.
 He said instead that he planned to travel shortly to Saudi Arabia to defend the price of oil. ''To $100,'' said Mr. Chavez. ''That is where we're headed.''

HEADLINE: STOCKS & BONDS Consumer Shares Weaken, But Technology Posts Gains

BYLINE: BY THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Stocks ended mixed yesterday as investors grappled with concerns about consumer spending in some parts of the economy while technology stocks showed broad gains.
 Stocks pared losses from early in the session to trade largely flat when investors tried to balance concerns about weakness in the economy with hopes that lackluster indications about the health of the consumer and the housing market could bolster the case for lower interest rates. 
Meanwhile, falling energy prices appeared to lend some support to stocks.
 Traders weighed a series of negative reports from companies whose fortunes are tied to the financial health of the consumer. The retailers Target and Lowe's trimmed their expectations for the year because of slowing sales, while the home builder Lennar posted a fiscal third-quarter loss and sharply lower revenue. 
 Target fell $2.95, or 4.6 percent, to $61.35, while Lowe's declined $2.04, or 6.7 percent, to $28.51. Shares of Lennar dropped 96 cents, or 4 percent, to $23.22.
 The latest economic reports offered fresh evidence that consumer sentiment is taking a hit amid the worst housing slump in more than a decade. The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index for September fell to its lowest level in almost two years. 
 The National Association of Realtors reported sales of existing homes fell for a sixth consecutive month in August to the lowest point in five years.
 These reports take on even more significance as Wall Street speculates about what the Federal Reserve's next move will be after last week's half-point interest rate cut. Data that show the economy is continuing to slow could bolster the case for further cuts.
 Not all the economic news was bad, however. The Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond said economic growth picked up in its region in September.
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 19.59 points, or 0.14 percent, to 13,778.65. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slipped 0.52 point, to 1,517.21, while the Nasdaq composite gained 15.50 points, or 0.58 percent, to 2,683.45. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 2.80 points, or 0.35 percent, to 803.00.
 The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was unchanged at 4.63 percent; its price remained at 100 30/32.
 The dollar resumed its decline against the euro, hitting record lows for a fourth session. By late afternoon in New York, the euro was at $1.4146, compared with $1.4087 Monday.
 The November contract for a barrel of crude fell $1.42, to $79.53, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It was the first time in more than a week that oil closed below $80 a barrel; last week, the price neared $84.
 Some investors appeared to regard technology stocks as being less at risk of slumping demand should the economy falter. Apple rose to another record, while Research in Motion hit a 52-week high. 
 Apple traded as high as $153.22 intraday, topping its earlier high of $149.85, and ended regular trading up $4.90, or 3.3 percent, at $153.18.
 Research in Motion moved as high as $96.85 -- above its previous 52-week high of $96.35 -- and closed at $96.82, a gain of $2.32, or 2.5 percent.
 Following are the results of yesterday's auction of four-week bills:

HEADLINE: Goods Orders Off Sharply For August

BYLINE: By REUTERS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 26 

 BODY:
New orders for high-priced manufactured goods dropped at the sharpest rate in seven months in August, according to a government report, which added to signs that growth was slowing in the third quarter. 
 Orders for durable goods plummeted 4.9 percent in August, Commerce Department data showed, with declines in nearly every major category.
 The fall was steeper than the 3.1 percent decline Wall Street economists had forecast but followed an upwardly revised 6.1 percent increase in July that left analysts confident the economy was not headed into a precipitous decline.
 ''The notion the economy is in free fall because of the housing market slowdown is not being validated by these numbers,'' said Peter Kenny, managing director at Knight Equity Markets in Jersey City.
 Analysts are watching whether problems in United States subprime mortgage markets will pull down United States and global growth. Housing data this week showed continued pressure.
 A proxy for business spending -- orders outside the military sector for capital goods, excluding aircraft -- fell 0.7 percent in August after a 0.9 percent gain in July.
 The government's monthly durable goods report is volatile and subject to substantial revisions, but the August report was striking because the declines were so widespread. Even excluding transportation, orders fell 1.8 percent after rising 3.4 percent in July.
 The drops in overall orders and in orders excluding transportation both were the steepest since January, when overall orders dropped 6.1 percent and orders excluding transportation fell 3.1 percent.

HEADLINE: Fighting Global Warming

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 ''In Turnaround, Industries Seek U.S. Regulations'' (front page, Sept. 16) points out that industry is engaging in a form of unenlightened self-interest as it pushes for mild federal regulation that blocks stricter state standards and limits consumer rights while doing nothing to address the real dangers posed by their products. This effort is particularly dangerous when it comes to global warming, which Congress may get serious about for the first time this fall. 
 To meet the challenge of global warming, Congress must act quickly and decisively to pass strong, science-based legislation that reduces global warming pollution fast enough to protect future generations.
 The Earth's climate is close to a critical tipping point, and even moderate additional warming could lead to severe consequences. Climate scientists warn that there is a very short window of time to begin the serious emission reductions we need to have a decent chance of avoiding dangerous impacts. 
 To prevent such impacts, the United States must halt increases in emissions now and reduce emissions by at least 15 percent by 2020 and 80 percent by 2050. As Congress turns its attention to global warming, our leaders must resist industry attempts to push for half-measures. Instead, we need bold action that will protect our environment, economy and future generations.

HEADLINE: G.M. Pact With Union Sets Off a Rally

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Stocks rose soundly yesterday after word that General Motors had a tentative contract agreement with the United Automobile Workers and that Bear Stearns might sell a share in the company. 
 G.M., one of the 30 stocks that makes up the Dow Jones industrial average, led the market higher from the outset with news that a tentative pact that ended a two-day strike could allow the company to shed some of its burdensome health care costs.
 Rumors that Bear Stearns would sell a stake took on new urgency in the final hour of trading with a report that the billionaire investor Warren E. Buffett was a potential suitor.
 ''Certainly it's good to have problems that have been overhanging Bear Stearns off the table, if that can be done. That should help the financials,'' said William D. Rutherford, president of Rutherford Investment Management in Portland, Ore., alluding to the recent failure of two Bear Stearns hedge funds.
 The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 99.50 points, or 0.72 percent, at 13,878.15. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index advanced 8.21 points, or 0.54 percent, to 1,525.42, and the Nasdaq composite index increased 15.58 points, or 0.58 percent, to 2,699.03.
 Treasury prices also turned higher yesterday on surprisingly strong investor demand in a government sale of $18 billion in two-year Treasury notes. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 2/32, to 101. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 4.62 percent, from 4.63 percent.
 The dollar recovered slightly against major currencies yesterday despite lackluster economic data, but not before hitting another record low against the euro. Gold prices fell.
 Oil futures ended higher, closing above $80 a barrel as a turbulent day ended with a late rally led by investors who saw an early price dip as a buying opportunity. Light crude settled at $80.30 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 Wall Street shrugged off broader economic news from the Commerce Department, which said demand for durable goods fell in August by the largest amount in seven months. 
 Wall Street often regards such reports as good news because they can provide new reasons for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates.
 In addition to corporate and economic news, some of the session's gains could be traced to the approaching end of the quarter.
 ''As you get closer to the end in the next couple of days, you could get some window dressing,'' said Marc Pado, United States market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald, referring to some investors' plans to buy and sell stocks to shore up their end-of-the-quarter holdings.
 G.M. jumped $3.26, or 9.5 percent, to $37.68, after workers agreed to return to their jobs after a two-day nationwide strike. 
 Bear Stearns had been higher throughout the session on rumors it would sell a piece of the company. The investment bank then doubled its gains after The New York Times reported that Mr. Buffett, among others, had shown interest in a minority stake in the company. The stock finished up $8.42, or 7.4 percent, at $122.66.

HEADLINE: Man With Rifle Is Arrested on St. John's Campus

BYLINE: By ELLEN BARRY and COREY KILGANNON; Al Baker, Annie Correal and Jennifer 8. Lee contributed reporting.

 BODY:
A troubled student wearing a Fred Flintstone mask and carrying a .50-caliber rifle was arrested at St. John's University in Queens yesterday afternoon, prompting the authorities to lock down the campus for three hours while they searched for a possible second gunman, the police said.
 The student, Omeash Hiraman, a 22-year-old freshman, was walking through the campus carrying a black plastic bag with the gun's barrel sticking out of it when a campus security guard approached him and grabbed at the weapon, police said. 
 A struggle followed, and another student, Chris Benson, came by and helped subdue Mr. Hiraman. Mr. Benson and campus security guards restrained him until the police arrived. 
 The police later determined there was no second gunman. There were no injuries.
 The police said Mr. Hiraman's gun contained one round of black powder-charge ammunition. His lawyer, Anthony J. Colleluori, described the gun as ''kind of like a Dick Cheney hunting rifle.'' Charges are pending, the police said.
 Mr. Colleluori said Mr. Hiraman had graduated from Stuyvesant High School in Manhattan and enrolled at Cornell University, then transferred to St. John's, a school he ''happens to love.'' He said his client was ''very tired, he's confused,'' and surprised to hear that his arrest had caused an uproar on the campus. 
 ''He's not a person who would walk into Columbine and shoot people up,'' he said.
 Mr. Hiraman's father, Pat, said his son had recently undergone surgery for scoliosis and may have been reacting to medications. ''We believe this is a misunderstanding,'' he said. 
 The scene at the university yesterday underlined how campus security has been rethought in this country since April, when a gunman killed 32 people at Virginia Tech. Instead of fleeing out of classrooms and onto the street, students at St. John's were instructed, via text message to their cellphones, to stay where they were.
 The messages went out so rapidly that Mr. Benson, a 21-year-old criminal justice major and police cadet, who held Mr. Hiraman against the wall, said he felt his cellphone vibrate with the information while he was restraining the gunman. 
 It was the first time St. John's had used the text-messaging system, which was made available at the beginning of this school year, said Thomas Lawrence, the university's vice president of public safety. 
 According to the police, Mr. Hiraman arrived on campus in a livery car at 2:20 p.m., 10 minutes before the start of his next scheduled class. By 2:38, a message had been sent to students, informing them that an armed man had been apprehended on campus and instructing them to stay where they were. The police then made sweeps of campus buildings, where many students, ''understandably,'' had locked themselves in, said John Colgan, an N.Y.P.D. assistant chief. 
 All afternoon, friends and relatives waited anxiously outside the campus, some of them visibly distraught. Inside, some students piled desks against doors to create barricades. The wait was tense, as text messages ricocheted back and forth. Jay P. Louis Jr. said he received 50 messages during that period, from friends who reported rumors: a hostage situation; a second and even a third suspect; gunmen wearing masks depicting Bill Clinton and George Bush.
 ''Our whole thing was, what if he's in here with us?'' said Akiera Greene, 18. But as thousands of students poured out of university buildings, shortly after 5:30 p.m., most said the university had managed the situation well. 
 After the initial text message went out, several students began to cry and ''one girl tried to run for it,'' said Flavius Pestano, 20, a marketing major. But overall, he said, administrators at St. John's ''did it in a very structured way.'' 
 Marc Iervolino, 21, was driving out of a campus parking lot when the order went out to lock down the campus. His Audi was parked in the same spot, a few feet from the road, an hour later, as he waited for the police to release him. If he had not arrived late for his sports economics class, he too would have been stuck in a classroom, he said. 
 ''It's freaky,'' he said. 
 Several students said they saw Mr. Hiraman as he walked across the campus toward Marillac Hall, which houses a food court and numerous core classes, wearing a black hooded sweatshirt, fatigue pants and a rubber mask. Kaitlin Otte, 18, said ''sweat was seeping from underneath the mask,'' and Mr. Hiraman looked ''weird.'' Mr. Benson interrupted a phone call with his girlfriend to tell her, ''Let me call you back. A guy just walked past me with a gun.'' 
 Mr. Benson fell in step behind Mr. Hiraman, who was walking quickly, and grabbed him while the security guard tried to wrestle his gun away. He said Mr. Hiraman was totally silent while he restrained him. Yesterday afternoon, Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly called to congratulate Mr. Benson, who said at a news conference that he intends to become a police officer. 
 ''My appetite was pretty wet already,'' Mr. Benson said. 
 Jeff Melo, a freshman who watched the struggle from a window, said that the suspect did not appear intent on killing students. 
 ''I think if he had wanted to shoot people, I think he would have done it,'' said Mr. Melo, 17. 
 Late in the afternoon, the police searched Mr. Hiraman's home, a neat two-story house near La Guardia Airport. 
 Carlos Acosta, 28, who lives on the same block as Mr. Hiraman, called him ''the most strait-laced kid you could meet.'' 
 ''He was all about his books and didn't hang out much,'' he said. ''He just went to and from school.''

HEADLINE: The Mideast Money Flows

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

 BODY:
As head of the Carlyle Group, David M. Rubenstein is a regular at power lunches along the New York-Washington corridor. 
 But he recently had his midday meal in Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, 6,847 miles from the Washington headquarters of his private equity firm, with the Persian Gulf on one side and a desert on the other.
 Mr. Rubenstein and other American financiers have long traveled to the Middle East in search of energy dollars to finance deals in the United States. Carlyle, in fact, has been one of the more aggressive in courting Mideast investors.
 These days, as Dubai and its neighbors have begun to invest aggressively outside the Persian Gulf, American investors, in turn, have begun investing in the region -- and some of the money is coming from American pension funds. 
 Buyout managers and Wall Street bankers are setting up shop so they can invest in transportation projects and real estate developments and privatizations of state-owned companies. Their use of pension fund money, however, could complicate America's already sensitive relations with the region.
 The investment attention on the Middle East comes at a particularly delicate moment. Lawmakers in the United States have increasingly questioned the public-policy implications of pension fund investments. On Monday, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California pledged to sign legislation forcing the state's two pension funds to shed holdings of all companies that have energy or military-related business in Iran. Seventeen other states, including Florida and Texas, have either passed or are considering similar legislation.
 Pension funds have become a crucial source of money for buyout firms as they the funds have increasingly allocated more to private equity and hedge funds in search of higher returns.
 And the political tensions extend beyond pensions. When Halliburton, the military contractor based in Houston, announced in March that it was moving its headquarters to Dubai, some lawmakers expressed outrage.
 The politics has not stopped the buyout firms. Carlyle, which owns Dunkin' Donuts, is raising $1 billion for a fund for acquisitions in countries like Egypt, Jordan, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. Ripplewood Holdings, a New York private equity firm that owns Reader's Digest, spent $200 million for a controlling stake in Egypt's largest bank. And Colony Capital, a property buyout firm, has bought control of Libya's largest oil company.
 Private equity funds devoted to investing in the Middle East and North Africa grew to $5.2 billion in 2006, from $316 million in 2004, according to Zawya Private Equity Monitor. 
 Calpers, the California Public Employees' Retirement System, among other pension funds, is planning to invest in Carlyle's Middle East fund and is also an investor in Ripplewood. The pension fund opposed Governor Schwarzenegger's pledge. To comply, the fund expects to sell nearly $2 billion in investments in 10 companies and has estimated it will cost $17 million in transaction fees. 
 ''We don't have political strains,'' said Patricia K. Macht, a spokeswoman for Calpers. ''We are agnostic where specific investments are made.'' 
 Some in Washington are not so willing to put politics aside completely. ''Public pension funds are public and should respond to democratic forces,'' said Representative Brad Sherman, Democrat of California. While he is ''not for boycotting the entire Middle East,'' he does have concerns about investments in certain countries. 
 ''Syria would not make me happy,'' Mr. Sherman said. ''We should be trying to change Saudi behavior.'' 
 While Syria or Iran may not be reflective of the rest of the Middle East, buyout chiefs still need to sell investors and politicians on the merits of a region that is politically fraught and, in some cases, still better known to some for terrorism than capitalism.
 ''I was on the phone with my mother last night and told her I was in Dubai,'' said Mr. Rubenstein, a white-haired 58-year-old with large tortoise-shell-rim glasses, explaining the challenge he faces. ''Of course, she asks, 'Is it safe? There's always bombs going off and wars,''' he recounted, rolling his eyes for effect. ''I told her Dubai is probably a lot safer than Florida.'' 
 Mr. Rubenstein may be helped by the billions of dollars that Middle Eastern countries are investing in the United States and Europe. The region has spent $64 billion so far this year on investments abroad, according to Dealogic, compared with $30.8 billion in all of 2006. 
 Last week, the Borse Dubai, the government-controlled exchange, agreed to take a 19.9 percent stake in the Nasdaq and buy Nasdaq's 28 percent stake in the London Stock Exchange. And the Qatar Investment Fund said it had acquired 20 percent of the London exchange. On top of that, Abu Dhabi government bought a 7.5 percent stake in Carlyle. And in July, Istithmar, an arm of the Dubai government, bought one of fashion's crown jewels: Barneys New York. 
 Some deals have already caused friction. Last year, the proposed sale of some American ports to a Dubai firm set off a firestorm in Congress that abated only after alternative buyers were found.
 Still, these crosscurrents of investment are increasing the economic ties between the Persian Gulf countries and the United States -- ties that have been strained after Sept. 11. Indeed, 9/11 was a turning point in the flow of capital into the region. 
 ''Post-9/11 shook up the politics in the West,'' said Arif Naqvi, chief executive of Abraaj Capital, a buyout firm in Dubai. ''It was a watershed event because it made us realize that there were a lot of opportunities at home. The days of the Middle East just being a source of capital are over -- it's become a destination.''
 Not all private equity executives are rushing in. Joseph Rice, a founder of Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, which owns Hertz, said his firm was still ''years away'' from investing in the region. Nonetheless, he has been traveling to the region to raise money. 
 ''We're here for fund-raising,'' he said, overlooking the Burj Al Arab, a hotel that towers over Dubai's beachfront.
 Mr. Rubenstein defended his firm's Middle East fund. ''People see that there's going to be a lot of economic activity here and a lot of value creation.'' Still, he acknowledged, ''it doesn't hurt'' with fund-raising that the firm has shown a commitment to the region.
 For Carlyle, the decision to wade into the Middle East is particularly delicate. For the last five years, the firm has tried to distance itself from what was seen as Middle East ties and its political connections.
 Former President George H. W. Bush and former Secretary of State James A. Baker III had been advisers, which opened up relationships for the firm to raise money in the 1990s. As a result, however, the firm collected money from the bin Laden family. The firm has spent six years trying to rid itself of the image that created..
 Then last week's announcement that the Abu Dhabi government would take a minority stake in Carlyle resurrected old ghosts, and bloggers surfaced with new conspiracy theories.
 One other potential source of controversy for Carlyle: the fund will not invest in Israel. Mr. Rubenstein refused to discuss why certain countries were included or excluded, but people involved in the fund-raising said it would make it difficult politically to raise money from most Middle Eastern countries if Israel were included.
 Of course, the big question is whether there are promising investment opportunities in a region already sloshing with money and at a time when the dollar is at its weakest. 
 Mr. Naqvi said of Carlyle's entrance into the market: ''I think their timing is a little off. There's already too much liquidity. A donkey can raise money. You can't just ride in here in a Rolls-Royce.'' Still, he added: ''Carlyle is at our doorstep and we love it.''

HEADLINE: Our Moral Footprint

BYLINE: By VACLAV HAVEL. 
Vaclav Havel is the former president of the Czech Republic. This article was translated by Gerald Turner from the Czech.

 BODY:
Prague
 OVER the past few years the questions have been asked ever more forcefully whether global climate changes occur in natural cycles or not, to what degree we humans contribute to them, what threats stem from them and what can be done to prevent them. Scientific studies demonstrate that any changes in temperature and energy cycles on a planetary scale could mean danger for all people on all continents. 
 It is also obvious from published research that human activity is a cause of change; we just don't know how big its contribution is. Is it necessary to know that to the last percentage point, though? By waiting for incontrovertible precision, aren't we simply wasting time when we could be taking measures that are relatively painless compared to those we would have to adopt after further delays? 
 Maybe we should start considering our sojourn on earth as a loan. There can be no doubt that for the past hundred years at least, Europe and the United States have been running up a debt, and now other parts of the world are following their example. Nature is issuing warnings that we must not only stop the debt from growing but start to pay it back. There is little point in asking whether we have borrowed too much or what would happen if we postponed the repayments. Anyone with a mortgage or a bank loan can easily imagine the answer.
 The effects of possible climate changes are hard to estimate. Our planet has never been in a state of balance from which it could deviate through human or other influence and then, in time, return to its original state. The climate is not like a pendulum that will return to its original position after a certain period. It has evolved turbulently over billions of years into a gigantic complex of networks, and of networks within networks, where everything is interlinked in diverse ways.
 Its structures will never return to precisely the same state they were in 50 or 5,000 years ago. They will only change into a new state, which, so long as the change is slight, need not mean any threat to life. 
 Larger changes, however, could have unforeseeable effects within the global ecosystem. In that case, we would have to ask ourselves whether human life would be possible. Because so much uncertainty still reigns, a great deal of humility and circumspection is called for. 
 We can't endlessly fool ourselves that nothing is wrong and that we can go on cheerfully pursuing our wasteful lifestyles, ignoring the climate threats and postponing a solution. Maybe there will be no major catastrophe in the coming years or decades. Who knows? But that doesn't relieve us of responsibility toward future generations.
 I don't agree with those whose reaction is to warn against restricting civil freedoms. Were the forecasts of certain climatologists to come true, our freedoms would be tantamount to those of someone hanging from a 20th-story parapet. 
 Whenever I reflect on the problems of today's world, whether they concern the economy, society, culture, security, ecology or civilization in general, I always end up confronting the moral question: what action is responsible or acceptable? The moral order, our conscience and human rights -- these are the most important issues at the beginning of the third millennium. 
 We must return again and again to the roots of human existence and consider our prospects in centuries to come. We must analyze everything open-mindedly, soberly, unideologically and unobsessively, and project our knowledge into practical policies. Maybe it is no longer a matter of simply promoting energy-saving technologies, but chiefly of introducing ecologically clean technologies, of diversifying resources and of not relying on just one invention as a panacea.
 I'm skeptical that a problem as complex as climate change can be solved by any single branch of science. Technological measures and regulations are important, but equally important is support for education, ecological training and ethics -- a consciousness of the commonality of all living beings and an emphasis on shared responsibility.
 Either we will achieve an awareness of our place in the living and life-giving organism of our planet, or we will face the threat that our evolutionary journey may be set back thousands or even millions of years. That is why we must see this issue as a challenge to behave responsibly and not as a harbinger of the end of the world. 
 The end of the world has been anticipated many times and has never come, of course. And it won't come this time either. We need not fear for our planet. It was here before us and most likely will be here after us. But that doesn't mean that the human race is not at serious risk. As a result of our endeavors and our irresponsibility our climate might leave no place for us. If we drag our feet, the scope for decision-making -- and hence for our individual freedom -- could be considerably reduced.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Tax Proposal

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Taxing the Hand That Feeds Us,'' by Ramesh Ponnuru (Op-Ed, Sept. 20), about the general lack of Republican tax proposals: 
 I have not called simply for a flat tax, but for an optional flat tax. My plan would not raise taxes on middle-income families or anyone else because only those for whom a flat tax would reduce the tax burden would elect to pay the flat tax. The option of the flat tax allows those who find the current code overly burdensome to choose to pay a low flat tax. 
 Also, Mr. Ponnuru claims that no one is proposing to increase the tax credit for children. In fact, I have introduced legislation, the Parents Tax Relief Act of 2007, which would increase the child tax credit. My tax proposals will assist middle-income families, grow the economy and, of particular concern to Mr. Ponnuru, reclaim the tax issue for Republicans.

HEADLINE: Myanmar Attacks Protesters, Arresting Monks

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS; Steven Lee Myers contributed reporting from New York.

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Sept. 27 

 BODY:
Beginning the second day of their crackdown on nationwide protests in Myanmar before dawn today, security forces raided at least two Buddhist monasteries, beating and arresting dozens of monks, according to reports from the capital, Yangon.
 Facing its most serious challenge since taking power in 1988, the ruling junta is attempting to contain the uprising by tens of thousands of monks who have been at the heart of more than a week of huge demonstrations against economic hardships and the political repression of the military junta.
 On Wednesday, in a chaotic day of huge demonstrations, shooting, teargas and running confrontations between protesters and the military, many people were reported injured and half a dozen were reported to have been killed, most of them by gunshots.
 The Associated Press reported that more shots were fired today at one of several monasteries raided early in the day, Ngwe Kyar Yan, where one monk said a number of monks were beaten and at least 70 of its 150 monks were arrested. 
 A female lay disciple said a number of monks were arrested at a second monastery, Moe Guang, which was being guarded, like a number of other monasteries, by a contingent of armed security personnel.
 The government began its violent crackdown Wednesday after tolerating more than a month of ever-larger protests in cities around the country, clubbing and tear gassing protesters, firing shots into the air and arresting hundreds of the monks and their supporters. The government of Myanmar began a violent crackdown on Wednesday after tolerating more than a month of ever larger protests in cities around the country. Security forces clubbed and tear-gassed protesters, fired shots into the air and arrested hundreds of the monks who are at the heart of the demonstrations.
 A government announcement said security forces in Yangon, the country's main city, fired at demonstrators who failed to disperse, killing one man. Foreign news agencies and exile groups reported death tolls ranging from two to eight people.
 Despite threats and warnings by the authorities, and despite the beginnings of a violent response, tens of thousands of chanting, cheering protesters flooded the streets, witnesses reported. Monks were in the lead, like religious storm troopers, as one foreign diplomat described the scene.
 In response to the violence, the United Nations Security Council called an emergency meeting on Wednesday to discuss the crisis, but China blocked a Council resolution, backed by the United States and European nations, to condemn the government crackdown. 
 However, Secretary General Ban Ki-moon announced that the United Nations was ''urgently dispatching'' a special envoy to Myanmar, formerly known as Burma. 
 A spokesman for President Bush, in New York City for the opening of the United Nations General Assembly, denounced the crackdown and urged restraint. A day before, White House officials had expressed hope that Mr. Bush's announcement of new sanctions directed against the military government's leaders would intensify pressure on them not to use violence against the protesters.
 ''The United States is very troubled by the action of the junta against the Burmese people,'' the spokesman, Gordon D. Johndroe, said Wednesday afternoon. ''We call on them to show restraint and to move to a peaceful transition to democracy.''
 Though the crowds in Yangon, formerly Rangoon, were large and energetic on Wednesday, they were smaller than on previous days, apparently in part because of the deployment of armed soldiers to prevent monks from leaving some of the main temples.
 But it appeared that an attempt by the military to halt the protests through warnings, troop deployments and initial bursts of violence had not succeeded. Political analysts said the next steps in the crackdown might be yet more aggressive and widespread. 
 The foreign diplomat described an amazing scene on Wednesday as a column of 8,000 to 10,000 people flooded past his embassy following a group of about 800 monks.
 They were trailed by four truckloads of military men, watching but not taking action. The diplomat, in keeping with his embassy's policy, spoke on condition of anonymity.
 According to news reports and telephone interviews from Myanmar, which is sealed off to foreign reporters, the day's activities began with a confrontation at the giant gold-spired Shwedagon Pagoda, which has been one of the focal points of the demonstrations.
 In the first reported violence in nine days of demonstrations by monks in Yangon, police officers with riot shields dispersed up to 100 monks who were trying to enter the temple, firing tear gas and warning shots and knocking some monks to the ground. As many as 200 monks were reported to have been arrested at the pagoda.
 Several hundred monks then walked through downtown Yangon to the Sule Pagoda, another site of the demonstrations, where truckloads of soldiers were seen arriving Tuesday. A violent confrontation was reported there; more shots were fired and a number of arrests were made.
 On a broad avenue near the temple, hundreds of people sat facing a row of soldiers, calling out to them, ''The people's armed forces, our armed forces!'' and ''The armed forces should not kill their own people!''
 In Mandalay, Myanmar's second largest city, more than 800 monks, nuns and other demonstrators were confronted by some 100 soldiers who tried to stop them from marching from the Mahamuni Paya Pagoda, which they had tried to enter earlier, The Associated Press reported.
 The demonstrations in Yangon have grown from several hundred people protesting a fuel price rise in mid-August to as many as 100,000 on Sunday, led by tens of thousands of monks in the largest and most sustained protests since 1988.
 That earlier peaceful uprising was crushed by the military, which shot into crowds, killing an estimated 3,000 people. It was during the turmoil that the current military junta took power in Myanmar, and it has maintained its grip by arresting dissidents, quashing political opposition and using force and intimidation to control the population.
 Now, emboldened by the presence of the monks, huge crowds have joined the demonstrations in protests that reflect years of discontent over economic hardship and political repression.
 At first, the government held back as the protests grew. It issued its first warning on Monday night, when the religious affairs minister said the government was prepared to take action against the protesting monks.
 On Tuesday night, the government announced a dusk-to-dawn curfew, banned gatherings of more than five people and placed the cities of Yangon and Mandalay under what amounts to martial law. Troops began taking up positions at strategic locations around Yangon and tried to seal off five of the largest and most active monasteries.
 As the protests grew, public figures began to come forward, and on Tuesday the government arrested the first of them, a popular comedian, Zarganar, who had urged people to join the demonstrations. He had irritated the government in the past with his veiled political gibes.
 The crackdown on Wednesday came in the face of warnings and pleas to the junta from around the world to refrain from the kind of violence that had made the country's ruling generals international pariahs.
 At the United Nations, President Bush on Tuesday announced a largely symbolic tightening of American sanctions against Myanmar's government. The European Union threatened to tighten its own sanctions if violence was used. On Wednesday, the British prime minister, Gordon Brown, said the first step after any meeting of the Security Council should be to send a United Nations envoy to Myanmar.
 The Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader, and Desmond Tutu, the former archbishop of Cape Town and antiapartheid campaigner, have spoken out in support of their fellow Nobel Peace Prize laureate Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the Burmese pro-democracy leader, who has been held under house arrest for 12 of the last 18 years.
 The junta was also hearing the message directly from diplomats based in Yangon. The British ambassador, Mark Canning, said he met with a government official on Tuesday to urge restraint.
 ''You need to look very carefully at the underlying political and economic hardships,'' he said he told the official. ''The government must also understand what this is about -- not fuel prices, but decades of dissatisfaction.''

HEADLINE: The Plight of the Loggerhead Turtle

 BODY:
For a while during the 1990s, it looked as though the loggerhead sea turtle might really be making a comeback. But a new federal report -- a 5-year review that was mandated by the Endangered Species Act -- suggests that loggerheads, which are listed as threatened, have begun to decline again. Their life-pattern makes them doubly vulnerable to humans. They lay their eggs on beaches, habitat vulnerable to development and disturbance, in places like South Florida and Oman on the Arabian Peninsula, and they spend their long lives at sea, where they are often fouled in fishing nets. 
 It is partly the longevity of these creatures that makes their death as bystanders among the global fishing fleets feel so tragic, a truly colossal waste of life. A loggerhead reaches sexual maturity at around 35. Some kinds of fishing, like shrimp trawl fishing, lend themselves to the use of turtle excluder devices, which help sea turtles escape from nets. But it takes regular enforcement to ensure that those devices are used, and enforcement is always in short supply when it comes to the environment. Much of the global fleet, which grows larger and larger, is beyond such enforcement in any case. For an oceanic species such as the loggerhead, these are incredibly dangerous times.
 Like almost any threatened or endangered species, the loggerhead sea turtle raises a fundamental question about human will. The loggerhead has benefited from recovery plans, special legal status, the dedication of scientists and environmentalists and the general good will of the public. And yet all of this concerted human effort is required simply to restrain human economic activity -- fishing especially -- enough to allow this extraordinary species to share the planet with us. As always, in matters of species preservation, our efforts look as though they're directed at nature, when in fact they're really directed at ourselves.

HEADLINE: More Housing Woes in Mississippi

 BODY:
As the poorest state in the country, Mississippi should have no trouble finding low- and moderate-income homeowners to share in the more than $5 billion in emergency federal aid funneled into the state after Hurricane Katrina. 
 But a startling new analysis by a coalition of state and national housing advocates accuses Mississippi of using loopholes in the law to spend far too much on middle- and upper-income households and far too little on those most in need of help. 
 The Department of Housing and Urban Development, which oversees the program, needs to take a close look at how Mississippi is spending that money. 
 The aid was channeled through the Community Development Block Grant program, which was set up by Congress in the 1970s to improve housing for the poor and provide a better quality of life and more economic opportunities. The law requires states and localities to spend 70 percent of the money they receive on projects that will clearly benefit low- and moderate-income people. 
 After Katrina, Congress lowered that requirement to 50 percent for the Gulf Coast states, partly because people at all income levels had lost their homes. That seemed reasonable, given the nature of the emergency. 
 Low-income housing advocates were rightly uneasy about a second provision that allowed the Gulf Coast states to waive the income test altogether for some projects. They feared that the states would use waivers to reward cronies and boost pet projects. Indeed, Mississippi's critics now claim that only about 20 percent of the money spent so far has gone to help low- and moderate-income families. 
 Now Mississippi has floated a proposal that would divert $600 million from the housing recovery effort to a plan to rebuild the port at Gulfport. State boosters want to redevelop the area as a hub for casinos and cruise ships. 
 The state sees this as economic development. Housing advocates see it as an attempt to hijack money that should rightly be going to build and repair housing for displaced, low-income Mississippians. They also charge that the state has written the rules for its housing aid program in a way that denies help to large numbers of low-income homeowners, who would clearly be eligible under the same post-Katrina program in neighboring Louisiana.
 Congress must revisit the waiver process to make sure that states aren't using it to evade the income restrictions clearly laid out in federal law. And HUD needs to take a hard look at all aspects of the Mississippi program, and make sure that the remainder of the emergency aid money gets to the low-income families who are legally entitled to it and desperately need the help.

HEADLINE: W.T.O. Hears European Complaint of U.S. Aid to Boeing

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Boeing receives ''lavish'' government subsidies that give it an unfair competitive edge over its rival aircraft maker Airbus, the European Union told the World Trade Organization at a hearing yesterday. 
 The two-day proceeding is the first time that judges have heard the European Commission's aircraft subsidies case against Boeing and comes after a complaint by the United States about aid granted to Airbus, which is based in Toulouse, France and is the biggest producer of commercial aircraft. The European Union says Boeing has received $23.7 billion in Defense Department and NASA research subsidies, as well as state and local funding.
 ''The core of the E.U.'s challenge is the lavish R.&D. support, as well as Boeing-specific support'' from state governments, said the commission, the European Union's trade authority. ''The support clearly aims at weakening Airbus's position and competitiveness and boosting that of Boeing.''
 The European Union and the United States filed countercases in September 2004 over aid to Airbus and Boeing, the only two makers of large commercial aircraft in a $150 billion market. Together, the challenges are the largest to go before the World Trade Organization. Efforts to resolve the dispute by replacing a 1992 accord that set limits on government financing for the plane makers have failed.
 The United States presented its argument last November, saying government subsidies to Airbus in the form of risk-free grants amounted to $23 billion over the last four decades, or $205 billion if interest is included.
 At the heart of its case is the argument that the European Union offers loans below commercial rates and that Airbus uses the loans to begin new projects and repays them only if the aircraft are commercial successes.
 Each side has accused the other of supplying inaccurate data. The commission says the United States ''grossly inflates the numbers'' on Airbus support, while the United States argues that the European Union unfairly counts as government grants $10.4 billion that Boeing received from NASA for research services.
 A ruling in the case by the United States against Airbus, expected in December, has been delayed. An initial confidential report from judges on the European Union's filing against Boeing is expected in April.

HEADLINE: Headquarters at Home And Proud to Be There

BYLINE: By MARCI ALBOHER

 BODY:
LYNNE KILLEY followed the advice books when she opened a spa and started producing a line of natural skin care products out of her home in Pagosa Springs, Colo.: she tried to make her one-woman operation look bigger. 
 ''I referred to the company in the third person,'' she said. ''I made a logo, Stella, and sometimes billed things out under Stella's name.''
 Then, last summer, Ms. Killey's publicist organized a trip to New York so she could meet with magazine editors. In describing her business, Queen Bee Skin Care, Ms. Killey revealed that she made her products in her own kitchen. Even as she spoke, she said, she realized that perhaps her home-based model was a selling point and not something to hide. 
 ''Here I was sitting in front of people that I needed to impress, and they just loved that I was making the stuff in my kitchen,'' she said. Right about then, she rethought her strategy. 
 With about 50 percent of businesses in the United States based out of the home, this kind of transparency is likely to become more common. ''Place honestly doesn't matter anymore,'' said Maggie Jackson, author of ''What's Happening to Home'' (Sorin Books 2002). 
 ''It is no longer a faux pas to have a life at the other end of the telephone line.'' Ms. Jackson said. ''It can make you feel like you're dealing with a holistic person. And it is just another sign that we are moving away from the industrial age in that we no longer have two totally separate spheres called work and home.''
 Just as customers, vendors and other outsiders are getting a chance to peek behind the curtain into home offices, home-based entrepreneurs are also getting more opportunities to interact with each other. StartupNation, an online hub for small businesses, is running a contest, the Home-Based 100, that will rank home-based businesses according to various criteria, including ''the top financial performers,'' ''the greenest,'' ''the wackiest'' and ''boomers back in business.'' 
 ''Home-based businesses are out of the hiding part, but when we talk about business, we still talk about the Fortune 500, but not the half-trillion dollar economy of home-based businesses,'' said Richard Sloan, co-founder of StartupNation. ''This new community will also allow home-based businesses to connect with each other, get inspired and share best practices.''
 Chris Elam, the founder and choreographer of Misnomer Dance Theater, runs the company out of his Brooklyn apartment, and he is a big proponent of transparency. His company videotapes rehearsals and even office meetings for posting on its video blog, which allows audiences to get a behind-the-scenes look at what it takes to run a dance company. 
 ''Dance audiences traditionally interact with a dance company for only two hours a year and maybe get a couple of postcards,'' Mr. Elam said. ''But so much happens outside the performance, and we are trying to find ways of making the whole function of the company more open-source.''
 Margot J. Tohn is another home-based business owner who thinks there is no point in hiding. Her decision to start a publishing business came after a disastrous evening of trying to find parking in the theater district in Manhattan. She thought she would write a book about finding parking in New York, and since she was staying in her childhood home in Larchmont, N.Y., it made sense to start her business there to keep her start-up costs low. She could also store books in the garage. 
 The book, ''Park It! NYC'', is now in its second edition. She also works as a consultant for small financial advisers serving affluent families.
 Around the same time she started her business, Ms. Tohn, 43, and her two sisters bought the house from their parents, who had moved to Florida for their retirement. Even with this rather unusual housing arrangement, Ms. Tohn says she has found that being candid often worked to her advantage.
 ''If the local bookstore runs out of my book, I can easily run some over,'' she said. ''My consulting clients know that I am unusually accessible. It isn't uncommon for a client to call at 8 or 9 in the evening. It used to happen at 7 in the morning, but we put a stop to that.''
 Clients also know that she often leaves the office midday to play tennis or tend to her garden, and leaves the cellphone behind. ''When you start work 10 minutes after waking up, it's healthy to take real breaks.''
 Still, Ms. Tohn does not want to confuse her openness with a lack of professionalism. When she brings in a team of interns to help with a project, she sets them up in dining room where everyone can spread out around the table. ''It's all about creating a separate area from where I live,'' she said. 
 She is also a stickler about noise. ''I've learned from watching my two sisters keep home offices while raising their children,'' she said. ''When the door is shut to the office, it is shut, and they can't be interrupted unless it's blood or death.''
 Debra M. Cohen, 40, by contrast, says she designed her business, a contractor referral service for homeowners, around the idea that she might be on the phone for business and her children might be making a ruckus in the background. Her company, Home Remedies of New York, has become so successful, she says, that she now offers consulting services to others who want to copy her business model in their communities. Ms. Cohen says she has home referral operators running her programs in nearly every state and Canada.
 When exploring ideas for a business, she ran every idea through the ''can it be done from home with kids underfoot'' test, she said. 
 Working from home may allow for certain informalities, but it does not necessarily signal the size of an entrepreneur's vision. Ms. Cohen's business passed the million-dollar revenue mark four years after its founding. Bradley Rhine, 46, who works out of his home in San Jose, Calif., is a chief executive of Cogentes, a virtual consulting firm specializing in the information technology industry. Cogentes plans to hire 100 to 200 employees over the next several years. 
 The company has nine employees, in Atlanta, San Jose and Boston, and as it expands it does not consider where a person lives. ''Our ongoing proposition as to find the best people wherever they are,'' Mr. Rhine said.
 He said his firm's business model makes sense because it is now possible to outsource many aspects of a business's operations. The company uses outside firms for payroll, benefits, human resources, recruiting and marketing. 
 No one commutes, and everyone can live where they want, he said. ''It is just a ridiculous waste of time and resources. It is both wasteful and stressful,'' he added. ''Plus, it is bad for the environment.''

HEADLINE: Verizon Rejects Text Messages From an Abortion Rights Group

BYLINE: By ADAM LIPTAK

 BODY:
Saying it had the right to block ''controversial or unsavory'' text messages, Verizon Wireless has rejected a request from Naral Pro-Choice America, the abortion rights group, to make Verizon's mobile network available for a text-message program. 
 The other leading wireless carriers have accepted the program, which allows people to sign up for text messages from Naral by sending a message to a five-digit number known as a short code. 
 Text messaging is a growing political tool in the United States and a dominant one abroad, and such sign-up programs are used by many political candidates and advocacy groups to send updates to supporters. 
 But legal experts said private companies like Verizon probably have the legal right to decide which messages to carry. The laws that forbid common carriers from interfering with voice transmissions on ordinary phone lines do not apply to text messages.
 The dispute over the Naral messages is a skirmish in the larger battle over the question of ''net neutrality'' -- whether carriers or Internet service providers should have a voice in the content they provide to customers.
 ''This is right at the heart of the problem,'' said Susan Crawford, a visiting professor at the University of Michigan law school, referring to the treatment of text messages. ''The fact that wireless companies can choose to discriminate is very troubling.''
 In turning down the program, Verizon, one of the nation's two largest wireless carriers, told Naral that it does not accept programs from any group ''that seeks to promote an agenda or distribute content that, in its discretion, may be seen as controversial or unsavory to any of our users.'' Naral provided copies of its communications with Verizon to The New York Times.
 Nancy Keenan, Naral's president, said Verizon's decision interfered with political speech and activism.
 ''No company should be allowed to censor the message we want to send to people who have asked us to send it to them,'' Ms. Keenan said. ''Regardless of people's political views, Verizon customers should decide what action to take on their phones. Why does Verizon get to make that choice for them?''
 A spokesman for Verizon said the decision turned on the subject matter of the messages and not on Naral's position on abortion. ''Our internal policy is in fact neutral on the position,'' said the spokesman, Jeffrey Nelson. ''It is the topic itself'' -- abortion -- ''that has been on our list.''
 Mr. Nelson suggested that Verizon may be rethinking its position. ''As text messaging and multimedia services become more and more mainstream,'' he said, ''we are continuing to review our content standards.'' The review will be made, he said, ''with an eye toward making more information available across ideological and political views.''
 Naral provided an example of a recent text message that it has sent to supporters: ''End Bush's global gag rule against birth control for world's poorest women! Call Congress. (202) 224-3121. Thnx! Naral Text4Choice.''
 Messages urging political action are generally thought to be at the heart of what the First Amendment protects. But the First Amendment limits government power, not that of private companies like Verizon.
 In rejecting the Naral program, Verizon appeared to be acting against its economic interests. It would have received a small fee to set up the program and additional fees for messages sent and received.
 Text messaging programs based on five- and six-digit short codes are a popular way to receive updates on news, sports, weather and entertainment. Several of the leading Democratic presidential candidates have used them, as have the Republican National Committee, Save Darfur and Amnesty International. 
 Most of the candidates and advocacy groups that use text message programs are liberal, which may reflect the demographics of the technology's users and developers. A spokeswoman for the National Right to Life Committee, which is in some ways Naral's anti-abortion counterpart, said, for instance, that it has not dabbled in text messaging.
 Texting has proved to be an extraordinarily effective political tool. According to a study released this month by researchers at Princeton and the University of Michigan, young people who received text messages reminding them to vote in November 2006 were more likely to go to the polls. The cost per vote generated, the study said, was much smaller than other sorts of get-out-the-vote efforts. 
 Around the world, the phenomenon is even bigger.
 ''Even as dramatic as the adoption of text messaging for political communication has been in the United States, we've been quite slow compared to the rest of the world,'' said James E. Katz, the director of the Center for Mobile Communication Studies at Rutgers University. ''It's important in political campaigns and political protests, and it has affected the outcomes of elections.''
 Timothy Wu, a law professor at Columbia, said it was possible to find analogies to Verizon's decision abroad. ''Another entity that controls mass text messages is the Chinese government,'' Professor Wu said.
 Jed Alpert, the chief executive officer of Mobile Commons, which says it is the largest provider of mobile services to political and advocacy groups, including Naral, said he had never seen a decision like Verizon's.
 ''This is something we haven't encountered before, that is very surprising and that we're concerned about,'' Mr. Alpert said.
 Professor Wu pointed to a historical analogy. In the 19th century, he said, Western Union, the telegraph company, engaged in discrimination, based on the political views of people who sought to send telegrams. ''One of the eventual reactions was the common carrier rule,'' Professor Wu said, which required telegraph and then phone companies to accept communications from all speakers on all topics.
 Some scholars said such a rule was not needed for text messages because market competition was sufficient to ensure robust political debate.
 ''Instead of having the government get in the game of regulating who can carry what, I would get in the game of promoting as many options as possible,'' said Christopher S. Yoo, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania. ''You might find text-messaging companies competing on their openness policies.''

HEADLINE: The Executive Who Welcomed Wal-Mart to India

BYLINE: By HEATHER TIMMONS

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, Sept. 25 

 BODY:
Sunil Bharti Mittal is not shy about ambition. 
 ''I like to express myself through large, transformational projects,'' said Mr. Mittal, the 49-year-old chairman of Bharti Enterprises, one of India's most powerful conglomerates.
 In August, Mr. Mittal signed a deal to bring Wal-Mart to India as a wholesale operation. Neither party has disclosed the financial details, but if their venture succeeds, it will create India's first modern wholesale distribution system. 
 Refrigeration will be essential to that, Mr. Mittal said recently in an interview. ''The cold chain -- the trucking, the storage -- will all ensure that the whole nation gains,'' he said. India ''can become a food supplier to the rest of the world.'' 
 In spite of such sweeping certainty, or perhaps because of it, Mr. Mittal has become a figurehead of Indian capitalism. He leads the welcome wagon when foreign politicians and business executives visit, and he encourages them to invest. And this week, he headed up a business delegation to the United States, ostensibly to celebrate 60 years of Indian independence, but also to sell India as a destination for foreign business and capital.
 Mr. Mittal says his ambitious plans with Wal-Mart are part of his constant search for the ''next big fix.''
 His first was Bharti Airtel, a company Mr. Mittal founded and built into a national telecommunications firm worth more than $40 billion. 
 As the son of a politician in Punjab, Mr. Mittal lacked the generations of family money that jump-started the careers of many powerful Indian business executives. (He is not related to Lakshmi N. Mittal, head of the steel giant Arcelor Mittal.) After graduating from Punjab University, Sunil Mittal started a bicycle parts company with a small amount of cash from his father, then delved into various businesses before settling on telecommunications. 
 Bharti Airtel took off after winning a license for cellular phone service in the New Delhi area in the mid-1990s. 
 Detractors have suggested that his father's political connections won Mr. Mittal favors. But Mr. Mittal denies that his father pulled strings, noting that Airtel had just $5 million in profit in 1992, the year his father died. For the year ended last March, profit was 42.6 billion rupees ($1.07 billion). 
 Large as it is, Bharti Enterprises, like many top companies in India, retains some of the vestiges of the nation's past. For instance, just 39 percent of Bharti Airtel is publicly traded; 46 percent of the company is owned by Bharti Telecom -- which, in turn, is owned by Bharti Enterprises, a privately held group controlled entirely by the Mittal family. 
 Still, critics of Mr. Mittal and his business plans are few, and even fewer are willing to speak on the record. A rare exception was Rajeev Chandrasekhar, the former chief of a rival telecommunications company, who complained in The Times of India this month that Mr. Mittal had taken more credit than he was entitled to for India's telecommunications revolution. 
 Neither Wal-Mart nor Bharti Enterprises has revealed financial details of their partnership, Bharti Wal-Mart Private, except to say that each company holds a 50 percent stake. 
 The reason for Wal-Mart's interest in India is obvious: the country offers a middle class estimated to be as large as the entire population of the United States and several times the size of China's middle class. 
 But turning those hundreds of millions of people into chain store shoppers will not be easy. 
 Many small retailers, as well as some farmers and politicians, are vehemently opposed to the emergence of chain stores. After protests, Reliance, a local competitor of Bharti, has been forced to close several grocery stores and to lay off workers. 
 India's population of 1.1 billion people still shops mainly at small, privately owned stores, like family-run tailors and corner vegetable stands. 
 Trying to achieve economy of scale, Wal-Mart and Bharti plan to build 10 to 15 wholesale ''cash and carry'' stores over the next seven years to move items closer to retailers and largely replace the middlemen. The stores will stock groceries, clothing and durable goods.
 Wal-Mart is not the only foreign retail company interested in a stake in the Indian market. Wal-Mart swept in when a deal between Bharti and the British retailer Tesco fell apart, Mr. Mittal said. 
 Wal-Mart officials had met with Bharti executives previously. Aware of a delay in the Tesco talks, the American company stepped in. A month later, Mr. Mittal flew to Wal-Mart's headquarters in Bentonville, Ark., to meet Michael T. Duke, the company's vice chairman. 
 ''What struck me is they lived the simple life,'' Mr. Mittal said. ''This is a town that gets to sleep at 8 p.m., and everyone is in the office at 6 in the morning. I'd never seen anything like it.'' In contrast, Mr. Mittal lives in one of Delhi's most opulent houses. 
 But supporters of Mr. Mittal say that, regardless of the venture's outcome, his willingness to work with the giant rather than trying to go it alone is a positive sign. 
 ''That he's decided to team up with Wal-Mart shows he knows he doesn't know it all,'' said Scott R. Bayman, former president of GE India.

HEADLINE: Washington Sees an Opportunity in Iranian's Defiance

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER and THOM SHANKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 26 

 BODY:
A year and a half after President Bush told top aides that he feared he might be forced someday to choose between acquiescing to Iran's nuclear ambitions and ordering military action, the struggle to find an effective alternative -- sanctions with real bite -- is entering a new phase.
 The speech at the United Nations on Tuesday by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran is already being used by American officials in an effort to convince European allies that Iran's leadership will respond only to a sharp new wave of economic pressure, far greater than anything it has endured so far. Mr. Ahmadinejad, trying to make the case that no additional sanctions would derail Iran's uranium enrichment program, declared that ''the nuclear issue of Iran is now closed.'' 
 Until now, Washington has relied on gradually escalating sanctions, including convincing a growing number of banks that it is risky to lend new funds to Iran for major oil projects. Yet in interviews, American diplomats, White House officials and military officers acknowledge that the strategy has been largely ineffective. 
 So have veiled threats of military action. While President Bush and his aides insist that ''all options are on the table,'' senior officials say there is little enthusiasm in the White House or the Pentagon for military attacks on Iran's nuclear facilities, though they acknowledge that such war plans are always being refined.
 The officials say the Iranians fully understand that while the United States could destroy Iran's major nuclear facilities, it would be far harder to manage the probable response, which could include heightened attacks on American forces in Iraq, possible retaliation on Israel or the destabilization of governments from Lebanon to Pakistan.
 Administration officials say that the chances appear slim that the United States can enlist Russia and China behind really tough sanctions against Iran, and that it could take several months for such sanctions to emerge, if they do at all. 
 But for the first time, administration officials say, the European allies are talking about a far broader cutoff of bank lending and technology to Iran than any tried so far. The lead is being taken by the new government in France, whose president, Nicolas Sarkozy, issued a starker warning to the United Nations this week about a nuclear Iran than did Mr. Bush.
 That has created a new initiative between Washington and Paris unlike any since they split over the invasion of Iraq. The effort, said Stephen J. Hadley, the national security adviser, is intended to convince Iranians that the nuclear program is ''taking us into the ditch,'' and to make the pressure so great ''that they finally have to make a strategic choice.''
 In a meeting on Tuesday with editors and reporters for The New York Times, Mr. Hadley conceded that the United States was still struggling to understand how much pressure it would take to force Iran to make what he called a ''strategic choice'' and said that intelligence estimates ''vary widely'' about how much time remained before the Iranians could have a weapon.
 One senior European official who is taking part in conversations in New York this week to design sanctions that the entire European Union might agree to said it was now ''a race between how fast they can build centrifuges and we can turn up the pain.''
 So the discussions now center on cutting off even more lending to the Iranians and -- for the first time -- supplies of technology and other goods. But that would require severing, one by one, deep ties between European and Iranian businesses, and necessitate what Mr. Hadley called a consensus for ''aggressive action, even if that means compromising their commercial interests.''
 A range of officials acknowledged the difficulty of designing a military strike option effective enough to set the Iranian program back for many years. 
 While many of the sites have long been known -- especially the giant underground complex at Natanz, where just shy of 2,000 centrifuges have been installed -- there is no certainty that military action could destroy the entire system of well-disguised factories and laboratories, some known and some hidden. 
 And the turmoil certain to follow such an attack may not be worth military action that simply delays nuclear development, officials say.
 That probably explains why Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice have both vowed to pursue the diplomatic track, saying that military action is a last resort. But those comments have not silenced the speculation here, in Europe and in the Middle East that America is planning for an attack.
 ''This constant drumbeat of war is not helpful, and it's not useful,'' said Adm. William J. Fallon, the senior American commander in the region.
 In a telephone interview this week as he visited various regional capitals, Admiral Fallon pledged that the United States would ''maintain our capabilities in that region of the world in an attempt to make sure that if they opt for military activity there, that is not going to be very useful to them.''
 At the same time, he said, ''we will pursue avenues that might result in some kind of improvement in Iranian behavior.''
 ''I am not talking about a war strategy, but a strategy to demonstrate our resolve,'' Admiral Fallon said. ''We have a very, very robust capability in the region, especially in comparison to Iran. That is one of the things that people might want to keep in mind. Our intention is to make sure they understand that, but we are being prudent in our actions and certainly not trying to be provocative.''
 In recent days others have begun to speak openly about what the United States would face if Iran successfully fielded nuclear weapons or manufactured enough uranium to make clear that it could produce weapons in short order. It is that second possibility -- in which Iran would stay within the strict rules of the nuclear nonproliferation treaty -- that worries many intelligence officials. 
 Gen. John P. Abizaid, who retired this year as senior American commander in the Middle East, said that while the United States must do all it can to prevent Iran from going nuclear, the world could live with a nuclear Iran and could contain it.
 ''I believe that the United States, with our great military power, can contain Iran, that the United States can deliver clear messages to the Iranians that makes it clear to them that while they may develop one or two nuclear weapons, they'll never be able to compete with us in our true military might and power, and they should not underestimate either our resolve or our ability to deal with them in the event of war,'' General Abizaid said in a speech last week at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington policy institute
 He said the broad rules of deterrence that kept a nuclear peace between the United States and the Soviet Union during the cold war, and remain in effect with nuclear Russia and China today, would be effective against a nuclear Iran.
 ''I believe nuclear deterrence will work with the Iranians,'' General Abizaid said. 
 Inside the administration, senior officials say they have also considered organizing a regional forum to confront Iran, using as a model the ''six party'' talks with North Korea, an effort to put pressure on that country from all its neighbors. But in the Middle East, officials say, the idea has hardly gotten off the ground.
 ''As we talk to the regional leaders, we have yet to hear a single good idea for ways to find common ground, or a forum or framework for dealing with Iran,'' said one senior official involved in Iran policy. The problem, officials say, is that none of Iran's neighbors are willing and able to play the decisive role alongside the United States.

HEADLINE: G.M.-Union Deal Could End Business as Usual in Detroit

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD; Nick Bunkley contributed reporting.

 BODY:
For a generation, executives at the Detroit auto companies have complained that the huge cost of providing generous benefits for its unionized workers put them at a competitive disadvantage with surging foreign car companies like Toyota and Honda.
 Now, with a new contract agreement with the United Automobile Workers reached before dawn yesterday, General Motors has taken a momentous step toward eliminating much of that burden, a step likely to be followed by Ford Motor and Chrysler.
 The contract's main feature -- a health care trust called a voluntary employee benefit association, or VEBA -- means that G.M. will no longer have to carry the debt it will owe for employee and retiree health care benefits on its books. Earlier this year, G.M.'s chief executive, Rick Wagoner, referred to those obligations as ''very large and frankly formidable.''
 That debt is estimated at $55 billion for the next 80 years. So G.M. will establish the trust with about 70 percent of that amount, making an upfront payment of cash, stock and other assets. The difference is expected to come from gains on investments by the trust. 
 In return, the union won guarantees that medical benefits for hourly workers and retirees and their families will remain in place for the next two years. G.M. will also invest money in its American plants, and will maintain its current union work force of 73,000, according to Ron Gettelfinger, the U.A.W. president.
 ''It's a big step forward in dealing with this problem that's been quite intractable,'' said John Paul MacDuffie, a management professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. 
 Investors cheered the deal, bidding up G.M. shares more than 9 percent yesterday. 
 ''This is a landmark contract,'' said John A. Casesa, an auto industry analyst with the Casesa Shapiro Group.
 But Detroit also faces a new challenge. The American automakers will no longer have the excuse that their health care burden is a barrier to successfully battling Japanese auto companies in the United States. 
 Instead, analysts say, they will have to deliver on their promises that they can create a New Detroit, with lower costs, leaner and more efficient factories and, most important, can build vehicles that more consumers want to buy.
 ''This agreement helps us close the fundamental competitive gaps that exist in our business,'' Mr. Wagoner said in a statement.
 For the union, which struck G.M. for two days after negotiations bogged down, there are victories in the new contract that go beyond the details of its terms. 
 Reducing G.M.'s health care burden increases the chances that the company can pull off its turnaround effort, which could lead to more job security for members, Mr. Casesa noted. 
 That burden, combined with G.M.'s pension expenses and wages, means its hourly rate for union workers is about $80. Toyota's labor costs in the United States are less than $50 an hour. 
 It is also a wise public relations move for the union, Mr. Casesa said. ''It sends the message that the union is playing ball and you can't blame us anymore if G.M. can't compete,'' he added.
 Even so, there is already opposition within the union. In an interview yesterday morning on WJR-AM radio in Detroit, Mr. Gettelfinger acknowledged the debate in the union over shifting health care obligations from G.M. to the trust, which would be independently administered.
 ''There will be those who will mount opposition to that,'' Mr. Gettelfinger said. ''I'll be glad to stand up in front of anybody and defend that VEBA and show that they're going to be secure with their retirement benefits. I'm not afraid of that battle at all.''
 The burdens will not be lifted right away. The VEBA plan requires approval from courts as well as the Securities and Exchange Commission, a process expected to take about two years. 
 Despite the expense of setting up the VEBA, expected to cost more than $30 billion, G.M. can save in other ways. The change may improve G.M.'s debt rating, which is deep in junk status. Indeed, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services said it was considering a possible upgrade for G.M.'s debt.
 An higher grade would lower the overall cost of borrowing money, making it less expensive to develop new cars and trucks.
 Investors are also wary of unknown and growing liabilities, like long-term health care costs. G.M.'s burden is one reason its stock price, more than $90 a share in 2000, has languished.
 Yesterday, however, G.M.'s stock jumped $3.22, to $37.64, on word of the deal, which was reached at 3:05 a.m. Eastern time. 
 Ford said it was pleased that G.M. had a deal with the U.A.W., whose local leaders will learn details of the contract at a meeting tomorrow. After that, workers will begin to vote on the contract. 
 With a G.M. vote concluded, the union would pick either Ford or Chrysler as the next company for negotiations. If the union holds to its tradition of a pattern contract, both are likely to agree to similar health care deals.
 That would mean different things to each company.
 At Ford, the need to fund a health care trust to address its roughly $25 billion liability would increase the pressure on the company to sell its Jaguar, Land Rover and Volvo brands quickly. An investment on a par with G.M.'s would cost Ford about $17.5 billion.
 Even though Ford raised $23 billion last year, by mortgaging everything from its plants to its blue oval logo, it needs that money for product development and to pay for its reorganization plan. That would mean finding another source for the billions it would need to invest in a VEBA. 
 Ford is hoping to complete a list of bidders for Jaguar and Land Rover by Sunday, and to announce a winner next month. It still is assessing whether to sell Volvo, but people involved in the sale say it, too, could be sold by year's end.
 At Chrysler, now owned by the private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management, the health care trust would take over Chrysler's $18 billion cost burden, meaning an investment of about $12.6 billion likely to be required. 
 Chrysler's previous owner, DaimlerChrysler, took responsibility for its pension burden when the company was sold. Absent either of those burdens, Chrysler could again become one of the industry's more nimble companies.
 Beyond the bookkeeping effect of VEBAs, the health care funds could create a kind of incentive for Detroit companies and the union to modify their behavior. 
 Paying the high borrowing costs caused by their low debt ratings meant the Detroit companies had to keep wringing profits from big vehicles like sport utilities and pickups, rather than shifting to the smaller models with better fuel economy that consumers were demanding.
 Likewise, U.A.W. members, assured of health care benefits that were the envy of the labor movement, had little incentive to take better care of their health, since their generous coverage would pay for most any ailment.
 By contrast, Toyota, which pays premiums only for workers, not their families, has fitness centers at its factories and requires newly hired workers to exercise two hours a day during their training period.
 Now that outsiders will administer health care when the VEBA trusts come into being, the companies may move more swiftly to transform their lineups, and, in the case of G.M. and Ford, make greater use of smaller more efficient vehicles developed overseas. Outsiders will play another pivotal role as the industry moves forward, too. Ford's chief executive, Alan R. Mulally, who came from the Boeing Company, and the former Home Depot chief executive Robert L. Nardelli, now at Chrysler, have spent just over 13 months between them in the American industry. 
 The old excuse, 'that's how we do it here,'' holds little water with either executive, both charged with reshaping their companies for Detroit's future, not preserving its status quo. 
 Mr. Mulally ''sees a company that was distracted'' from its core business, ''and his job is to get them refocused,'' said Mr. MacDuffie, the Wharton professor. 
 ''Six months ago, a VEBA would have been a very hard sell'' to union members, Mr. Casesa said. ''But Detroit's problems actually have given Detroit a lot of leverage. It took a crisis to create change.''

CORRECTION-DATE: September 29, 2007

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article on Thursday reported on the implications of the newly negotiated contract between General Motors and the United Automobile Workers union, including the impact of its terms on both the company and its unionized employees. Among the provisions was a voluntary employee benefit association, or VEBA, which will hold in trust the money to provide health care benefits to union members. The article said that under previous contracts, the medical benefits were so generous that union members had little incentive to take better care of their health. This unattributed assertion, unsupported by any evidence that personal health habits are influenced by the level of health care coverage, should not have been made. 

GRAPHIC: PHOTO: G.M. workers leaving the plant in Parma, Ohio, after abandoning their picket lines yesterday, ending a two-day walkout. (PHOTOGRAPH BY TONY DEJAK/ASSOCIATED PRESS) (pg. A30) CHART: DETAILS OF THE AGREEMENT: People who have been briefed on the new agreement between United Automobile Workers and General Motors say it contains: VEBA fund G.M. will establish a voluntary employee benefit association, or VEBA, a trust fund to take over its estimated $55 billion liability for worker and retiree health care benefits. The company reportedly will invest cash, stock and other assets equal to about 70 percent of the liability. The VEBA would be established after court and government approval, probably in 2009. Health care benefits Will remain at current levels for active and retired workers until the VEBA is established. Contract length Four years, through 2011. Wages There are no wage increases, and G.M. can establish a two-tier wage and benefit structure at some plants. Workers would receive a $3,000 bonus once the contract is signed by union leaders and company officials. They would receive additional lump-sum payments in the last three years of the contract. Jobs The company agrees to maintain job levels that are equal to the 73,000 workers it has now. It pledged to hire some temporary workers, making them permanent U.A.W. members. Buyouts Another round of incentives for workers to retire or give up their jobs will reportedly be offered by G.M. Pensions Retired workers will receive increased benefits to offset higher medical expenses they have incurred since 2005. Plants G.M. did not specify which plants would remain open or where it would invest, but the contract is said to include new investments in American factories. (pg. A30)

Suggested Time Allowance: 1 hour
Objectives:
Students will:
1. Share opinions on the contents of articles in The Times Business Day section by assessing their headlines.
2. Learn about business decisions made by several networks based on audience polls by reading and discussing the article "At 9 Wednesday, in One Ring, 3 Contenders."
3. Search through the Business Day section of The Times to find items for a scavenger hunt.
4. Write summaries of an individually selected issue presented in a New York Times article targeted to their peers.
Resources / Materials:
-pens/pencils
-classroom board
-seven large poster boards (prepared as outlined in the Warm-Up)
-markers (two per workstation for the Warm-Up)
-copies of the Business Day section of The Times (several copies to share among the class)
-copies of the article "At 9 Wednesday, in One Ring, 3 Contenders," found online at http://www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20070927thursday.html (one per student)
Activities / Procedures:
1. Warm-Up/Do-Now: Before class, prepare seven large poster boards each titled with one of the following headlines from the Business Day section of The Times. Then place the posters at different stations around the room along with markers and/or pencils.
-"At 9 Wednesday, in One Ring, 3 Contenders"
-"A Reversal in the Index of Happy"
-"The Arrival of Halo 3 Is a Reward for Fans, and Microsoft"
-"No Limit For Waits On Runways"
-"Amazon Digital Music Store Goes Online"
-"Trailblazers Heading to a New Shopping Destination"
-"Court Won't Reopen Pooh Lawsuit"
Write the following prompt on the board: "In what section of the paper might you find this headline? Who or what do you think is the subject of the article? What information would you expect to find in the article?"
When students enter the class, have them visit as many of the seven workstations as they can in a five minute period. At each station, direct them to respond to the prompt. After a few moments, bring the posters to the front of the room and have students review them together. What, if anything do the articles have in common? Inform the class that all of the headlines are from articles that appeared in the Business section of The Times on Wednesday, September 26. The subjects for each are as follows (in order): new network TV series, research poll, video game, airports and airlines, music, shopping and a legal battle involving the Disney company. Ask students which of these subjects might be of interest to them and why.
2. As a class, read and discuss the article "At 9 Wednesday, in One Ring, 3 Contenders" (http://www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20070927thursday.html), focusing on the following questions:
a. What clues, if any, does the headline offer about the contents of the article?
b. To what unrelated theme does the headline allude?
c. In what way is the competition among network shows like that of competitive sports?
d. What is the goal of the pre-season polls?
e. What specific behavior or activities are measured by the poll? How?
f. How accurate are the polls? What information can you cite to support that view?
g. How might the information influence your own TV-watching behavior?
h. Why might the information presented in the article be of interest to readers of the Business Day section of The Times?
i. Why do you think this news is published in the business section? In what other section of the newspaper might you find related news?
3. Distribute copies of the Business Day section of The New York Times. If available, provide access to the New York Times on the Web, found at http://www.nytimes.com/pages/business/index.html. Some questions below will be specific to online features, so feel free to skip those if your class does not have Web access. Allow students up to twenty minutes to scan the section for each of the following:
-Find a stock quote for an American company whose product or service you use. What activity has the stock seen in the last two days? In the past year?
-Find a chart or graph. How is the information presented different from the information written in the article?
-Read one of the columns or blogs (on the Web) in this section. Write down one opinion you read there. Do you agree or disagree? Why?
-Choose a fact, trend, or news item from somewhere in this section that you think might directly affect you, your family or your community. Describe the information and possible effects.
-Find a photo that interests you. Without reading the article, what do you think this photo tells about what it reports?
-Find an article that features a product or service you or your family use. Write the name of the product or service and summarize what the article says about it.
-Name one advertiser in this section and speculate on why the decision was made to advertise here.
-Can you think of another industry or company that might want to advertise in this section? Why?
-Make a list of the countries represented by the articles, photographs, graphs and market reports that comprise this section.
-Pick a country you would like to visit. Report on how its currency is doing today against the dollar. In which country would citizens benefit from the current exchange rate? Why?
-How many articles in this section are about e-commerce of some kind?
-Find one piece of information about how e-commerce has changed an industry.
-Choose one industry that interests you that is discussed in today's section (such as advertising, travel, real estate or fashion). Why does this industry interest you? What did you learn from the news you read today?
As the activity may be too long for students to complete individually, you may choose to arrange them into teams, working all together on the same question or as tag teams; or assign a selection of questions to each group; or only assign a section of the list to the entire class.
Prompt students that some answers may be used more than once. After students have scanned and taken notes on the Business Day section, divide students into small groups. Allow time for students to share their answers within their small groups. Discuss differences in opinions and encourage students to justify their choices.
During the last five minutes of class, students should come together as a large group to discuss the section as a whole. Consider questions such as: What elements did you think this section of the paper included? Why? What elements of this section surprised you? What do you think was missing from this section? How might you encourage your peers to look at this section? What can be learned by exploring this section of the paper, even if one is not an investor or interested in business as a career?
Allow students to take home parts of the Business Day section as a reference for their Wrap-Up/Homework assignments.
4. Wrap-Up/Homework: Individually, students read the Business Day section (in print or on the Web) every day over the next week and choose one article that features an issue or idea that might be of interest to their peers. Have them report on the issue and prepare a summary of it to present to the class. Why might this issue affect the lives of teenagers and/or their families? What facts are needed in order to understand the issue? What graphics (charts, graphs, illustrations, or photographs) might clarify the issue or provide interest to the story?
Have students present their summaries in a future class.
Further Questions for Discussion:
-Are there sections of The Times that you find more difficult to read? Less difficult? More relevant to your life? Less relevant? What are they, and why?
-To what degree do you follow new developments on issues that affect your own life?
Evaluation / Assessment:
Students will be evaluated based on participation in the opening exercise, thoughtful participation in the scavenger hunt and completion of their summaries.
Vocabulary:
arcane, avidly, antecedents, ad infinitum, mediocre, validation
Extension Activities:
1. Create a guidebook using economic terms that appear in the Business Day section of The Times. Submit the finished work to the school library or resource room as a reference.
2. Write a comedic monologue that references a breaking news item published in the Times.
3. Introduce your classmates to another section of the Times, such as Dining, Arts, Sports, including a section on the weekend. Explain how and why the information in that section may relate to their lives.
4. What topic would you like to see added to The Times that is not currently offered? What section would you like to see changed (added to or altered in some way)? Write articles, headlines and show a new layout based on your ideas.
5. Compare print and online versions of the paper by viewing features and multimedia features. Log in three times in one day and see how the news changes over that period.
Interdisciplinary Connections:
Civics - What role does the government play in regulating the United States economy? Investigate and prepare a poster report on a regulatory agency such as the Securities and Exchange Commission, U. S. Mint, Federal Reserve Board or the Department of Commerce.

HEADLINE: Sugar Cane's Bitter Harvest In the Dominican Republic

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN

 BODY:
''The Price of Sugar,'' Bill Haney's muckraking documentary about Haitians lured into a form of indentured servitude on sugar plantations across the border in the Dominican Republic, focuses on the Rev. Christopher Hartley, a courageous and stubborn Spanish priest who devoted 10 years to bettering their desperate plight. 
 The movie visits the workers' shantytowns, known as bateyes, which, according to the film, resembled forced labor camps patrolled by armed guards before Father Hartley's reform movement. Through his organizing and relentless pressuring of the plantation owners in the face of death threats, some bateyes in his parish now have improved living and working conditions and have been visited by American doctors. 
 A robust, charismatic organizer, Father Hartley is a disciple of Mother Teresa. Born in 1959 to an aristrocratic Spanish-British family, he dropped out of an elite private school at 15, joined a seminary and for much of 20 years, beginning in 1977, worked with her in poor communities around the world. His sojourn in the Dominican Republic began in 1997 when he volunteered as a missionary in the diocese of San Pedro de Macoris, a 600-square-mile parish based in the town of San Jose de los Llanos. The conditions he found on the plantations, he says, were tantamount to slavery.
 Each year, as the sugar harvest approaches, as many as 20,000 Haitian workers are recruited with the promise of steady work at higher pay than they can earn in Haiti, the poorer of the two countries. With the complicity of military and immigration authorities, the movie says, these destitute immigrants are loaded onto trucks, stripped of their identification papers and transported in the middle of the night to the bateyes, where many are housed in concentration-camp-like barracks. Estimates of the population of undocumented Haitians living in the camps range from 650,000 to one million.
 Once harvesting begins, the film explains, they work 14 hours a day, seven days a week, earning less than $1 a day with minimal-to-nonexistent health care. Instead of cash, they are paid in vouchers that can be redeemed for overpriced food at company-owned stores. Since they can afford only one meal a day, most of the calories they consume come from chewing sugar cane. Since children born in the bateyee are not recognized as Dominican citizens, they grow up stateless. 
 Many of the plantations shown are owned by the Vicini family, a dynasty of sugar barons who refused to be interviewed for the film and sent the filmmakers a cease-and-desist letter in an attempt to block its release. The United States, which imports much of the Dominican sugar, is partly culpable, the movie says, because of political contributions from the barons that have helped maintain the price of imported Dominican sugar at close to double the world price. 
 ''The Price of Sugar'' is narrated in calm, gravelly tones by Paul Newman. Like most documentary polemics, it simplifies the issues it confronts and selects facts that bolster its black-and-white, heroes-and-villains view of raw economic power. 
 The film does show how Father Hartley's efforts backfired in sad, unforeseen ways. Once the immigrant laborers were permitted to travel outside the bateyes, they flooded the town of San Jose de los Llanos, and simmering ethnic hatred of Haitians among Dominicans came to a boil, fanned by bribery and propaganda from the sugar barons. 
 Father Hartley was reassigned to Ethiopia in August. The future of the bateyes is unclear. He worries that once the pressure is off the Vicini Group (the country's second-largest sugar producer), his reforms will be rescinded and the previous labor conditions will resume.

HEADLINE: Blackwater Role In Shooting Said To Include Chaos

BYLINE: By JAMES GLANZ and SABRINA TAVERNISE

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Sept. 27 

 BODY:
Participants in a contentious Baghdad security operation this month have told American investigators that during the operation at least one guard continued firing on civilians while colleagues urgently called for a cease-fire. At least one guard apparently also drew a weapon on a fellow guard who did not stop shooting, an American official said.
 The operation, by the private firm Blackwater USA, began as a mission to evacuate senior American officials after an explosion near where they were meeting, several officials said. Some officials have questioned the wisdom of evacuating the Americans from a secure compound, saying the area should instead have been locked down. 
 These new details of the episode on Sept. 16, in which at least eight Iraqis were killed, including a woman and an infant, were provided by an American official who was briefed on the American investigation by someone who helped conduct it, and by Americans who had spoken directly with two guards involved in the episode. Their accounts were broadly consistent.
 A spokeswoman for Blackwater, Anne E. Tyrrell, said she could not confirm any of the details provided by the Americans. 
 The accounts provided the first glimpse into the official American investigation of the shooting, which has angered Iraqi officials and prompted calls by the Iraqi government to ban Blackwater from working in Iraq, and brought new scrutiny of the widespread use of private security contractors here.
 The American official said that by Wednesday morning, American investigators still had not responded to multiple requests for information by Iraqi officials investigating the episode. The official also said that Blackwater had been conducting its own investigation but had been ordered by the United States to stop that work. Ms. Tyrrell confirmed that the company had done an investigation of its own, but said, ''No government entity has discouraged us from doing so.''
 An Iraqi investigation had concluded that the guards shot without provocation. But the official said that the guards told American investigators that they believed that they fired in response to enemy gunfire.
 The Blackwater compound, rimmed by concrete blast walls and concertina wire in the Green Zone in central Baghdad, has been under tight control. Participants in the Sept. 16 security operation have been ordered not to speak about the episode. But word of the disagreement on the street has slowly made its way through the community of private security contractors.
 The episode began around 11:50 a.m. on Sunday, Sept. 16. Diplomats with the United States Agency for International Development were meeting in a guarded compound about a mile northeast of Nisour Square, where the shooting would later take place.
 A bomb exploded on the median of a road a few hundred yards away from the meeting, causing no injuries to the Americans, but prompting a fateful decision to evacuate. One American official who knew about the meeting cast doubt on the decision to move the diplomats out of a secure compound.
 ''It raises the first question of why didn't they just stay in place, since they are safe in the compound,'' the official said. ''Usually the concept would be, if an I.E.D. detonates in the street, you would wait 15 to 30 minutes, until things calmed down,'' he said, using the abbreviation for improvised explosive device.
 But instead of waiting, a Blackwater convoy began carrying the diplomats south, toward the Green Zone. Because their route would pass through Nisour Square, another convoy drove there to block traffic and ensure that the diplomats would be able to pass.
 At least four sport utility vehicles stopped in lanes of traffic that were entering the square from the south and west. Some of the guards got out of their vehicles and took positions on the street, according to the official familiar with the report on the American investigation.
 At 12:08 p.m., at least one guard began to fire in the direction of a car, killing its driver. A traffic policeman said he walked toward the car, but more shots were fired, killing a woman holding an infant sitting in the passenger seat.
 There are three versions of why the shooting started. The Blackwater guards have told investigators that they believed that they were being fired on, the official familiar with the report said. A preliminary Iraqi investigation has concluded that there was no enemy fire, but some Iraqi witnesses have said that Iraqi commandos in nearby guard towers may have been shooting as well, possibly leading Blackwater guards to believe that militants were firing at them.
 After the family was shot, a type of grenade or flare was fired into the car, setting it ablaze, according to some accounts. Other Iraqis were also killed as the shooting continued. Iraqi officials have given several death counts, ranging from 8 to 20, with perhaps several dozen wounded. American officials have said that no Americans were hurt.
 At some point during the shooting, one or more Blackwater guards called for a cease-fire, according to the American official.
 The word cease-fire ''was supposedly called out several times,'' the official said. ''They had an on-site difference of opinion,'' he said.
 In the end, a Blackwater guard ''got on another one about the situation and supposedly pointed a weapon,'' the official said.
 ''That's what prompted this internal altercation,'' the official said.
 The official added that in the urgent moment of a shooting events could often become confused, and cautioned against leaping to hasty conclusions about who was to blame.

HEADLINE: Home Sales And Prices Fall Sharply

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
Sales of new homes plunged in August to their slowest pace in more than seven years as tighter credit and rising inventories continued to weigh down the housing industry. The grim statistics could foreshadow further economic weakness in the fourth quarter, analysts said. 
 New-home purchases fell to an annual pace of 795,000, an 8.3 percent decline from July, as the number of months needed to sell off builders' inventories rose to the highest level since March, the Commerce Department reported yesterday. 
 The median price for a new home was down 7.5 percent from a year earlier, to $225,700, the steepest monthly price drop since December 1970.
 The sales figures were released as KB Home, a large Los Angeles builder, reported a $35.6 million loss in its fiscal third quarter, or 46 cents a share, in contrast to a profit of $153.2 million, or $1.90 a share, in the period a year earlier. KB Home had a 32 percent drop in revenue, to $1.54 billion. 
 The latest data gave a fuller picture of the distress in housing-related industries, where the subprime mortgage crisis has led to turmoil in the broader credit market and to increases in foreclosures. On Tuesday, the National Association of Realtors reported a 4.3 percent drop in August in sales of existing homes, and another large home builder, Lennar, recorded the largest quarterly loss in its history.
 Last month's drop-off in new-home sales was focused primarily in the South and the West, areas particularly hurt by subprime-lending problems. The seasonally adjusted pace of new-home sales is now down more than 21 percent from last year.
 ''If sales continue to fall, builders will continue to cut back on construction, which will be a direct drag to economic growth,'' said Michelle Meyer, a Lehman Brothers economist who specializes in the housing industries. ''Inventories remain elevated, home prices will fall as a result, and a decline in home prices will depress consumer spending.''
 KB Home wrote down almost $800 million in inventory, joint venture impairment and good will in the latest quarter. That offset the company's gains from selling its 49 percent stake in a French subsidiary. KB shares finished up 2.6 percent yesterday, at $24.71, still close to their 52-week low. 
 The company's chief executive, Jeffrey T. Mezger, said in a statement yesterday: ''Our third-quarter results reflect the seriously challenging market conditions that prevail for home builders across most of the nation. At this time, we see no signs that the housing market is stabilizing and believe it will be some time before a recovery begins.''
 Analysts concurred, predicting that the disappointing data signified only the start of an unfolding decline in housing that could last several quarters.
 ''Anybody that's expecting a turnaround in housing anytime soon is going to be disappointed,'' said Mike Schenk, a senior economist at the Credit Union National Association. ''It's going to be a long, slow process.''
 Richard Moody, chief economist at Mission Residential, a real estate investment firm, predicted a jump in foreclosures that would add to inventory woes. ''When you combine that with the tightening lending standard we've already seen,'' he said, ''and the tighter credit market conditions we've seen since August, it's going to take that much longer to work all this off.''
 Consumer spending was already starting to slow in the second quarter, according to the final reading on the gross domestic product released yesterday by the Commerce Department. Consumer purchases rose 1.4 percent in the quarter, compared with 3.7 percent in the first quarter.
 Consumers also had little relief from rising prices. The price index for personal consumption increased 4.3 percent, up slightly from an earlier estimate of 4.2 percent. In the first quarter, it rose 3.5 percent. Excluding food and energy, the index was up 1.4 percent compared with 2.4 percent in the first quarter.
 The gross domestic product, a tally of most goods and services across the economy, increased 3.8 percent in the second quarter, a revision downward from a previous estimate of 4 percent, the Commerce Department said. Exports and consumer spending were behind the increase, the department said, though the growth occurred before the subprime crisis became evident this summer. The G.D.P. increased 0.6 percent in the first quarter.
 In one bright spot for the economy, the number of new unemployment claims filed last week dipped to 298,000, its lowest level since early May. That figure, a decrease of 15,000 from the week ended Sept. 14, was better than Wall Street expectations, though some analysts warned against extrapolating a trend from a single week's data.
 ''Firing hasn't picked up, but new hiring has slowed down,'' said Joshua Shapiro, the chief United States economist for the research firm MFR.

HEADLINE: Stock Loans Are No Place For Secrecy

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Email: Norris@nytimes.com

 BODY:
An opaque market is a market that insiders love, simply because they can take advantage of outsiders. It is also a market that produces prices no one can be sure are trustworthy.
 The American stock market is as transparent a market as you are likely to find. Trades are posted virtually instantaneously, and so are the prices being sought by buyers and sellers. But a related market -- vital to the operation of the stock market as we know it -- is so opaque that even the insiders can get ripped off.
 That market is the stock loan market, the market in which shares are lent to those who need them, usually because they want to sell them short. 
 Opening up that market to sunlight could help people get fairer prices. It could also make it possible to do something about the issue of ''naked shorting,'' in which traders sell shares without either owning or borrowing them. But if change is going to happen, the Securities and Exchange Commission will have to step in.
 Last week, the government brought criminal charges against former stock loan employees at a number of brokerage firms, among them Morgan Stanley and A. G. Edwards. Because the market prices were so obscure, the government says, the employees could rip off their own firms by arranging for the firms to overpay when they borrowed shares. 
 The S.E.C., which also filed civil fraud allegations, says the actions brought in $12 million for the traders. This is a $700 million market, according to calculations by Vodia Group, a research firm, but one that is so hidden from view that this suspected fraud could go on for more than five years without being detected.
 The stock loan market is quite profitable to brokerage firms because short sales create what amounts to free cash to be invested. The shares that are sold are paid for with cash, but that cash does not go to the seller because he did not own the shares. Instead, it is held as collateral to assure the seller's repayment of the loan.
 The price of borrowing shares is stated as a percent of their value -- and is usually negative because the lender and the borrower share in the profits of the cash being invested. But it can be positive -- and get very high -- if the shares are especially hard to borrow.
 If the stock loan market were transparent, then it would be clear how much money a trader who failed to borrow shares was saving, argues James Angel, an associate finance professor at Georgetown University. ''The problem won't go away,'' he said this week, ''until the economic incentives are fixed.''
 Mr. Angel has suggested that the S.E.C. drop its complicated rules on the subject, known as Regulation SHO, and simply tell stock markets to levy fines for violations that would be higher than the costs the traders avoided. That would, he thinks, end the problem of naked short selling. There would still be some failures to deliver, caused by paperwork problems, but they would be relatively rare.
 It is not that simple, as Mr. Angel concedes. Such a change could lead to short squeezes in the form of sky-high borrowing costs, which could amount to stock manipulation on the upside, and he says it might be a good idea to put a cap on the fee. He would also like the S.E.C. to take steps to make more shares available for lending, by allowing brokerage firms to lend out shares held in all customer accounts, not just margin accounts.
 Mr. Angel is a longtime critic of Regulation SHO, and he told me he had been approached about being a witness for the plaintiffs in one of the pending lawsuits against brokers by investors who say they lost money because their stocks were manipulated through naked shorting. But he also, like most economists, deems short selling to be an important and vital part of markets -- ''our first line of defense against pump-and-dump manipulators.'' 
 There could be complications in making the share loan market transparent. Because such loans are a continuing relationship, not a one-time transaction like a stock purchase, lending rates may vary based on such things as service and willingness to avoid calling loans.
 But that is not the only reason brokerage firms may not like the idea. Profits can be lower for market makers in transparent markets, and while institutional investors share in the profits generated by lending their shares, individual investors generally do not. There might be pressures to let them in on the money, which Wall Street would not much like.
 But surely the people who run the big brokerage firms would welcome changes in a market where they seem to have been robbed for years, without noticing it. This is a market that could use a dose of sunlight.

HEADLINE: Health Fund Falls Well Short Of Pledge Goal

BYLINE: By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.

 BODY:
Donors pledged $9.7 billion yesterday to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria at a fund-raising conference in Berlin -- an increase over previous donations, but well short of the $15 billion to $18 billion the fund had hoped to raise. 
 Kofi Annan, the former United Nations secretary general, who led the creation of the multilateral fund in 2002, said he was ''very pleased with the pledges made.'' Some outside campaigners, however, expressed disappointment. 
 ''Today's pledges are welcome, but more needs to be mobilized,'' said ActionAid, a coalition of groups pushing for more health care for poor countries. It applauded the size of gifts from Spain ($600 million), Norway ($205 million), Sweden ($281 million) and the Netherlands ($326 million), while saying the largest donors, including Germany ($849 million), France ($1.3 billion) and Britain ($729 million), could have done more, given the strength of their economies.
 The donations -- meant to be spent over the next three years -- do not include new pledges by the United States or Japan.
 The United States committed only to maintain its annual contribution level, which would add up to $2.2 billion over the three years, until Congress passes a new budget. Japan wants to announce its contribution when it plays host to the Group of 8 summit meeting next year; if it stayed level, it would be $184 million.
 Other big donors included the European Commission, which pledged $425 million, and the Gates Foundation, which pledged $300 million.
 The fund, which has spent about $7 billion in 136 countries since 2002, is the chief source of money for the fight against the three diseases. It says it has saved two million lives so far, largely through the distribution of mosquito nets and the provision of anti-AIDS drugs.
 To hope to bring the diseases under control, the fund calculates that it will need to be spending $8 billion a year by 2010. 
 The next biggest sources of funds are two separate programs established by the Bush administration to fight AIDS and malaria.

 'WILLIAM HENRY FOX TALBOT: SELECTIONS FROM A PRIVATE COLLECTION' A distinguished private European collection is the source of this ever so lovely exhibition devoted to William Henry Fox Talbot, the 19th-century English gentleman-scientist, author of numerous mathematical and scientific papers, and inventor of the negative-positive photographic process, the basis of most photography before the digital era. He was also a pretty good photographer in his own right, producing a remarkable number and variety of photographs, from landscape and architecture studies to early panoramic city and street scenes and reproductions of artwork. Not surprisingly, he is widely regarded as the first accomplished artist-photographer. 
 All of the photographs in this exhibition are original prints, and most are in excellent condition, given their age and the delicacy of the materials. Talbot printed his photographs on good-quality writing paper, coated with silver salts. Then he hung the prints outside on racks and let the sun do the rest. Among the works on display are aerial views of the boulevards of Paris, and a quiet street scene in York: a confident composition showing a cathedral neatly framed by urban buildings. But equally arresting, if less known, are a series of closely observed photographs of cut and faceted glass and china arranged rhythmically on shelves. Obscured in reflections of light within these articles are tiny, distorted images of Talbot himself, staring back out at us across time. (Through Nov. 9, Hans P. Kraus Jr., Fine Photographs, 962 Park Avenue, at 82nd Street, 212-794-2064, sunpictures.com.) BENJAMIN GENOCCHIO
 Museums
 ASIA SOCIETY: 'ZHANG HUAN: ALTERED STATES,' through Jan. 20. The Chinese artist Zhang Huan, the subject of this small, midcareer survey, is best known for the early, often poetic, sometimes sensationally masochistic performance work he did in the 1990s, which can only be seen in videos and photographs now. The objects in this show, which include giant fragments of Buddhist sculptures made from copper sheets and incense ash, are products of his new workshop-style studio in Shanghai. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 288-6400, asiasociety.org.
 (Holland Cotter)
 BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'INFINITE ISLAND: CONTEMPORARY CARIBBEAN ART,' through Jan. 27. This large show, with 45 artists and a collective of designers, photographers and architects from the Dominican Republic adding to the count, fills two floors of temporary exhibition space, and care has been given to the selection. Several of the most substantial pieces were commissioned for the occasion. Organized by Tumelo Moshaka, associate curator of exhibitions at Brooklyn, it's an in-house job, a labor of love, though an uneven one. Too much work treads ground already covered by other art over the years. But what's good is really good, and the very existence of a show about identity politics, out of mainstream fashion in 2007, is cause for serious reflection. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. 
 (Cotter)
 THE JEWISH MUSEUM: 'CAMILLE PISSARRO: IMPRESSIONS OF CITY AND COUNTRY,' through Feb. 3. This exhibition contains few out-and-out masterpieces, but it does give us a rare look at the radical philosophies behind paintings that to a modern eye appear harmlessly bourgeois. For Pissarro, an anarchist and a Jew (albeit a secular one) in 19th-century France, Impressionism was about much more than the fleeting effects of light. It was about labor, the elimination of hierarchies and an idealized balance between urban and rural life. Pissarro emerges from this exhibition as an artist who never quite resolved the conflict between labor and sensation, but whose subtly anti-authoritarian stance propelled painting into the next century. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, jewishmuseum.org. (Karen Rosenberg)
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'BRIDGING EAST AND WEST: THE CHINESE DIASPORA AND LIN YUTANG,' through Feb. 10. Focused on a single modern family art collection, this show weaves like a DNA strand through the Met's Chinese painting galleries. The 40 examples of painting and calligraphy belonged to the writer and scholar Lin Yutang (1895-1976) and his descendants, who have divided their time between China and the West. Accumulated over years, the collection has the casual logic of a household photo album, with evidence of shared habits, tastes and temperaments, and of personal interchange between generations. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)THE MET: 'THE AGE OF REMBRANDT: DUTCH PAINTING IN THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART,' through Jan. 6. The Met has long advertised itself as a grand art multiplex, a cluster of several separate world-class museums under a single roof. And we get a demonstration in this display of its entire 17th-century Dutch painting collection: 228 pictures, of which roughly a third are usually on view at any time, and some never. In addition to the Rembrandts, there are five Vermeers, nearly a dozen Frans Halses, and the list goes on in an inventory of breathtaking scope and depth. How to package it? The Met has come up with a theme, and a perfect one for our time: money. The work has been sorted not by artists' names or dates, but by the names and dates of the collectors who bought and gave the paintings to the museum. This is the history of the Dutch Golden Age according to the American Gilded Age. (See above.) (Cotter)
 THE MET: 'COAXING THE SPIRITS TO DANCE,' through Dec. 2. How the Papuans practiced their beliefs on the remote Pacific island of New Guinea in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when they still had little contact with the West, is the complex and fascinating story told in this exhibition of some 60 objects and 30 rare photographs of the works on site or in actual use. The carved and painted ''spirit boards'' made throughout the gulf region, on the south coast of present-day Papua New Guinea, are probably the most easily recognized of the area's traditional artworks. Their central designs, passed down from fathers to sons and through marriages, typically represent a bush or river spirit, with a heavily stylized face and perhaps a small body, surrounded by various totemic symbols. More daring in concept are the masks used in ritual dances. Papuan art may not be as varied or exciting as that of many African or Amerind peoples, but it records a vibrant community. (See above.) (Grace Glueck)
 THE MET: 'EXCELLENCE AND ELEGANCE: DECORATIVE ARTS OF THE EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY QING COURT,' through Nov. 25. The consummate ambition that Chinese artists brought to diminutive scale is a striking feature of this small show of art from the Qing dynasty, China's last imperial line. The Qing were both conservatively antiquarian and expansively cosmopolitan, and those trends can be seen in the European-inflected versions of ancient Chinese forms in this show. (See above.) (Cotter)
 * THE MET: 'INCISIVE IMAGES: IVORY AND BOXWOOD CARVINGS,' through Nov. 25. This extraordinary show, drawn almost entirely from the Met's vaults, presents an array of nearly 100 carved figures, crucifixes, reliefs, containers, hand-held weapons and the occasional piece of furniture. It is an engrossing hive of religious fervor, Classical erudition (and occasional naughtiness), style shifts and multicultural crosscurrents. And among the many feats of drop-dead artistic skill are several of traffic-stopping caliber. Don't miss it. (See above.) (Roberta Smith)
 THE MET: 'NEO RAUCH AT THE MET: PARA,' through Oct. 14. The figurative style of the leader of the Leipzig School is never less than ambitious, but here it looks almost fatally retro, as if the context of the Met had made the painter's mind turn to thoughts of browned-out colors; characters of a Romantic 19th- century mien; and settings that often suggest garrets or hunting lodges. The result is an exhibition that looks too much at home in the museum and sells Mr. Rauch's talent short, but is still one that should be seen. (See above.) (Smith)
 * THE MET: 'ONE OF A KIND: THE STUDIO CRAFT MOVEMENT,' through Dec. 2. Focusing on the postwar development of artist-craftsmen who not only conceive and design their own objects but have a direct hand in making them, this display of furniture, glass, ceramics, metalwork, jewelry and fiber includes funny, quirky, provocative and sometimes gorgeous things. Among its stars are a witty bust by the California funk ceramicist Robert Arneson (1920-92), portraying the mother of the 16th-century painter and printmaker Albrecht Durer; John Cederquist's elegant cabinet concealed behind a trompe l'oeil door painted and veneered to look like a battered wooden packing case with a rowdy wave tearing through it; and Bonnie Seeman's fetching ceramic coffeepot and tray, whose mock cabbage leaves and rhubarb stalks evoke the genteel tradition of 18th-century British and continental china, but can also be read as human rather than vegetative tissue. Traditionalists, too, have their place in this show, with the wood workers Wharton Esherick and Sam Maloof represented by elegantly simple renditions in the furniture line; respectively, a music stand and a Shaker-like settee. (See above.) (Glueck) 
 THE MET: 'FRANK STELLA ON THE ROOF,' through Oct. 28. Two large Pop Art sculptures, two architectural models and a model enlarged into a sculpture-installation piece confirm that one of the greatest American artists of the postwar era doesn't do himself or anyone else any favors when he strays from the wall to work fully in the round. The results have a certain Stella-like verve but are otherwise generic. (See above.) (Smith)
 EL MUSEO DEL BARRIO: 'EL MUSEO'S BIENAL: THE (S) FILES,' through Jan. 6. You feel the growing pains and attempts to stretch out in the fifth edition of ''The (S) Files'' (short for ''The Selected Files).'' The show provides a survey of 51 emerging artists based in New York and from this year's invited guest country, Ecuador. Some of the works distinctly consider location, displacement and identity. Others are less concerned with issues that make for good biennial panel discussions and more interested in mining older art -- Surrealism, Minimalism and Postminimalism -- and employing craft techniques. Many of the artists in ''The (S) Files'' have appeared in other local survey shows, which raises the criticism often leveled at biennials: that in trying to cover the waterfront of contemporary art, they end up making the waterfront look, from every angle, increasingly the same. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem, (212) 831-7272, elmuseo.org. (Martha Schwendener)
 MUSEUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK: 'NEW YORK RISES: PHOTOGRAPHS BY EUGENE DE SALIGNAC,' through Oct. 28. This exhibition makes a case for adding Eugene de Salignac, the official photographer for the New York City Department of Bridges, Plant and Structures from 1903 to 1934, to the canon of American photographers whose images are forever linked with the city. He captured the Williamsburg, Manhattan and Queensboro Bridges just as construction was completed and the subways tracks were being laid. In some of his moving, eye-catching images, he exhibits his appreciation for New York's work force. 1220 Fifth Avenue, at 103rd Street, (212) 534-1673, mcny.org. (Bridget L. Goodbody)
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'REPICTURING THE PAST/PICTURING THE PRESENT,' through Nov. 5. Modern and contemporary artists reconsider both the picture book and standard narrative in works that use mythology, history and current events as their source material. Several pieces, like those by Max Beckmann, Christian Boltanski and William Kentridge, mine the 20th century's major conflicts. Religion enters in a variety of guises, as in James Ensor's ''Entrance of Christ Into Brussels'' or versions of ''The Temptation of Saint Anthony'' by Odilon Redon and Tim Rollins & K.O.S. (Kids of Survival). The legacy of slavery is addressed in Glenn Ligon's lithographs and Kara Walker's ''Harper's Pictorial History of the Civil War (Annotated),'' which will also complement the retrospective of Ms. Walker's work that opens at the Whitney in October. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Schwendener)
 NATIONAL ACADEMY MUSEUM: 'THE ABSTRACT IMPULSE: FIFTY YEARS OF ABSTRACTION AT THE NATIONAL ACADEMY, 1956-2006,' through Jan. 6. This exhibition illuminates the troubled history of abstraction at the academy over the last half-century, with a selection of 47 paintings, sculptures and works on paper by its members, many only recently elected, who took part in movements like Abstract Expressionism, Minimalism and Kinetic and Op Art. Drawn almost entirely from the museum's collection, it may not be an outstanding group of artworks, but it helps to explain how this once-celebrated museum and school lost much of its prestige. 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880, nationalacademy.org.

 NEW-YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY: 'NATURE AND THE AMERICAN VISION: THE HUDSON RIVER SCHOOL AT THE NEW-YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY,' through Jan. 13. The third show in a series on Hudson River School paintings from the collection argues that the idea of an American landscape filled with ''sacred'' sites is as much a cultural invention as it is an accident of nature. Thomas Cole's epic series of imaginary landscape paintings, ''The Course of Empire,'' is the centerpiece. Other works look back to the Old World, borrowing ideas about the European Grand Tour to create an American Grand Tour of natural sites along the Hudson, the Catskills, the Adirondacks and farther westward. The exhibition includes works by George Loring Brown, Asher B. Durand, Albert Bierstadt, Frederic Edwin Church and others. 170 Central Park West, at 77th Street, (212) 873-3400, nyhistory.org. (Schwendener)
 NOGUCHI MUSEUM: 'DESIGN: ISAMU KENMOCHI AND ISAMU NOGUCHI,' through March 16. The Bamboo Basket Chair was the result of a brief collaboration in 1950 between the Japanese-American sculptor and designer Isamu Noguchi (1904-88) and the Japanese industrial designer Isamu Kenmochi (1912-71). The chair was never manufactured, and the prototype was lost. The example here was recreated from photographs. Mostly, however, the chair provides an excuse to compare the design careers of Noguchi and Kenmochi and examine their roles in midcentury modern design, as well as the cultural relationship between Japan and the United States. Kenmochi's ''Japanese modern'' furniture is here, as well as a room devoted to Noguchi's most popular design achievement, the Akari light sculptures. 32-37 Vernon Boulevard, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 204-7088, noguchi.org. (Schwendener)
 QUEENS MUSEUM OF ART: 'GENERATION 1.5,' through Dec 2. Generation 1.5 refers to people who emigrate during their adolescent years, whose identity is shaped by both their old and new cultures. Some of the works in this exhibition address this process; elsewhere the show floats into general meditations on globalization and cultural dislocation. Lee Mingwei's ''Quartet Project,'' a sound and video installation, uses monitors playing a performance of Dvorak's ''American Quartet.'' Seher Shah's drawings combine lotus patterns, Mecca cubes and Western architectural motifs, and works by Rirkrit Tiravanija and Emily Jacir explore the successful contemporary artist as a globalized citizen. The show is emblematic of the museum's program, which is increasingly devoted to reflecting the borough's extreme diversity, but risks turning the immigrant experience into a platitude. Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, (718) 592-9700, queensmuseum.org. (Schwendener)
 THE STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: 'MIDNIGHT'S DAYDREAM,' through Oct. 28. The three artists in this show were artists in residence at the Studio Museum of Harlem in the last year, but their work represents very different approaches. Titus Kaphar is the classicist, taking European and American portrait paintings from the 18th and 19th centuries and reconfiguring them into strategic compositions. Wardell Milan II is the archetypal collagist, photographing arrangements of art reproductions, family photos and images cut from magazines. Demetrius Oliver is the Conceptualist, working in the trickster vein of David Hammons and Duchamp. All three, however, actively confront race and (art) history, which often seems a mandate for young black artists. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, studiomuseum.org. (Schwendener) 
 WADSWORTH ATHENEUM MUSEUM OF ART: 'FAITH AND FORTUNE: FIVE CENTURIES OF EUROPEAN MASTERWORKS,' through Dec. 9. Celebrating the return of its famous Renaissance, Baroque and Rococo paintings and objects of art from a three-year national tour, the Wadsworth has arranged a feast of a show. One of the most appealing things about this gathering of some 400 treasures is the mix, with knockout paintings keeping period company with small sculptures, elaborate table furnishings, decorative platters, Meissen knockoffs of Chinese pottery, a porcelain birdcage and vases and such. Strolling through the galleries, you'll find treasures like ''Saint Francis of Assisi in Ecstasy'' (about 1594-95), said to be the first authentic Caravaggio in an American museum; Fra Angelico's poignant, poetic fragment ''Head of an Angel'' (about 1455-50); and Francisco de Zurbaran's fearsome portrayal of a dead martyr, ''Saint Serapion'' (1628). But the piece de resistance is an entire gallery made into an art and curio cabinet, with a planned clutter of brilliant objects that play to a viewer's inner acquisitor: exotic shells mounted in gold; an extraordinary Baroque ivory carving (presumed to be before 1650) of Adam and Eve; an automatic tabletop clock (about 1619) with a standing lion that could roll its eyes, open its jaws and stick out its tongue when the hours struck. Dazzlement prevails. 600 Main Street, Hartford, (860) 278-2670, wadsworthatheneum.org. (Glueck)
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'RUDOLF STINGEL,' through Oct. 14. The work of this Italian-born artist, who is based in New York, seduces the eye while also upending most notions of what, exactly, constitutes a painting, how it should be made and by whom. His favored materials include carpet and Styrofoam, as well as paint on canvas. His style swings between abstract purity and Photo Realism. His grandly spare survey has a mirrored floor and a foil-covered room, lighted by a crystal chandelier, that visitors may mark on and that he may or may not later appropriate as a painting. As enthralling as it is perturbing, his work combines beauty, humor and a democratic slant with a rigorous sense of economy. It also forms one of the best-looking exhibitions seen lately at the Whitney. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Smith)

 'GUILLERMO KUITCA: STAGE FRIGHT' The Argentine-born Guillermo Kuitca makes art for and about opera, but he could never be accused of upstaging the singers: he peers out from their side of the curtain, taking in the intimidating arc of the audience. Just in time for the opening of the fall season, the tiny, year-old Gallery Met at Lincoln Center (just off the lobby of the Metropolitan Opera) places Mr. Kuitca's meditations on the architecture of opera houses in intimate proximity to the real thing. ''Stage Fright'' collapses Wagner's Gesamtkunstwerk into two dimensions, with a Surrealist-inspired hybrid of painting, printmaking and digital photography. Gallery Met at Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metoperafamily.org, through Nov. 1. (Rosenberg)
 Galleries: 57th Street
 'KOREAN FUNERARY FIGURES: COMPANIONS FOR THE JOURNEY TO THE OTHER WORLD' What makes this somewhat unusual for a show of mortuary art is that the kkoktu, or figures adorning funeral biers, were created for ordinary citizens rather than for aristocrats or the wealthy. They're also rather fun and friendly. Brightly painted clowns, acrobats and animals were meant to accompany the dead into the next world, to ease the journey and provide consolation for the mourners. Among the 74 kkoktu are versions of ''The Guide,'' riding an animal; ''The Guard,'' who protects the soul from evil spirits; ''The Caregiver'' (generally women); and ''The Entertainer,'' as well as a replica of a funeral bier modeled on a late-18th-century original from Tongyoung, South Kyongsang Province. The Korea Society, 950 Third Avenue, (212) 759-7525, koreasociety.org, through Nov. 20. (Schwendener)

 JULES DE BALINCOURT: 'UNKNOWING MAN'S NATURE' In his first New York solo appearance since decamping to Berlin, Jules de Balincourt continues to send up the enlightened global conscience on an increasingly varied scale. The 16 paintings and a sculpture in this latest show, all from this year, veer from notebook- to carpet-size, and from hedonism to grim survivalism. Two immense landscapes dominate: a sprawling coastal nightscape (possibly Los Angeles) and a melting glacier awash in neon pink. Mr. de Balincourt's stenciled slogans exhort us to ''think globally and act locally,'' even as the tiny figures that populate his compositions seem to have given up the fight. Zach Feuer Gallery, 530 West 24 Street, (212) 989-7720, lflgallery.com, through Oct. 13. (Rosenberg)
 'DOCUMENTA 5' This art extravaganza first occurred in Kassel, Germany, 35 years before this summer's 12th incarnation, and its achievements tend to be shrouded in myth. As the first lavish international exhibition to play up Minimal and Conceptual art, it upset lots of people, including not a few Minimalists and Conceptualists. Centering on the first exhibition's distinctive orange three-ring catalog, this meticulous show revisits its publications, press coverage, controversies and various byproducts, like a shopping bag by Joseph Beuys. It is highly educational and unexpectedly riveting. Specific Object, 601 West 26th Street, Room M285, (212) 242-6253, specificobject.com, through Oct. 8. (Smith)
 NATALIE FRANK: 'WHERE SHE STOPS' There is a heavy dose of Lucien Freud in Natalie Frank's paintings. She also borrows from Paula Rego, Jenny Saville and Cecily Brown. From American painters she adopts Delia Brown's interest in the decorative and decadent, and Eric Fischl's psychosexual narratives. The hybrid British-American lineage makes sense since Ms. Frank studied at the Slade in London and earned a Master of Fine Arts from Columbia in New York. The real friction comes from seeing a painter in her 20s exhibiting works in Chelsea that look like something you'd see in traditionalist strongholds on 57th Street. The implication seems to be that there's something radical in Ms. Frank's approach to figurative painting, when really there's not. Mitchell-Innes & Nash, 534 West 26th Street, (212) 744-7400, miandn.com, through Oct. 13. (Schwendener)
 DANA FRANKFORT: 'DF' In her disappointing Chelsea gallery show, this promising young artist continues to mine the busy intersection of painting and language. While she has expended a lot of her energy effectively developing her considerable instinct for color, her paint handling loses out. Harried and splintery, it suggests both a parody of expressionism and genuine emotional turmoil. A greater effort is needed. Bellwether, 134 10th Avenue, between 18th and 19th Streets, (212) 929-5959, bellwethergallery.com, through Oct. 6. (Smith)
 'MAKERS AND MODELERS: WORKS IN CERAMIC' This show of ceramic sculptures by 30 artists is beyond timely, even if the choices are at times too Gladstone-centric and cautiously mainstream. There are several outstanding efforts, among them Rosemarie Trockel's wryly beautiful day bed, Anne Chu's toasty ''Hellish Spirits'' (life size) and Andrew Lord's ambitious experiment in ceramic outreach. Kai Althoff, Anish Kapoor, Liz Larner, Rebecca Warren and, of course, the great Ken Price reward attention, as do newcomers like Gert and Uwe Tobias, Klara Kristalova and, the show's biggest splash, William O'Brien. Gladstone Gallery, 515 West 24th Street, (212) 206-9300, gladstonegallery.com, through Oct. 13. (Smith)
 RAYMOND PETTIBON: 'HERE'S YOUR IRONY BACK (THE BIG PICTURE)' I love Raymond Pettibon all the time, but especially when he's mad, and he's mad as hell in this floor-to-ceiling display of splenetic and coruscating drawings about Middle East politics, Iraq and a world fueled by war culture. It's a great, brutal, hilarious show, a controlled explosion. David Zwirner, 519 West 19th Street, (212) 727-2070, www.davidzwirner.com, through Oct. 20. (Cotter)
 ARLENE SHECHET: 'NEW WORK' This terrific show 23 years into a productive career offers evocative glazed ceramic vessel-sculptures. One group of elaborately bulbous, ostensibly monochrome forms conjures scholar's rocks, genie-sprouting lamps, hookahs and ungainly, if abstracted, dancers. Another meditates on the Japanese tea ceremony with fat, roughly scooped-out cylinders mottled with textures and colors. Throughout, multiple spouts conjure up pot handles, limbs and snouts, especially the trunk of Ganesh, the Hindu elephant god. Elizabeth Harris Gallery, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 463-9666, eharrisgallery.com, through Oct. 6. (Smith)
 MAXIMILIAN TOTH: 'UNTIL THE YOUNG ARE HATCHED, FLEDGED AND FLOWN' The paintings in this young artist's solo debut look like giant anecdotal chalk drawings on blackboards. Kids horse around beside a seaside pier; toilet paper streamers hang from a tree on Halloween. And violence is ever present, in a bull-wresting contest, a Mardi Gras celebration with a shooting death, and in the midair meeting of a pair of eagles. Mr. Toth has a febrile hand and a good sense for off-center narrative, and he keeps things loose, a good sign. Fredericks & Freiser, 536 West 24th Street, (212) 633-6555, fredericksfreisergallery.com, through Oct. 6. (Cotter)

 SADIE BENNING: 'FORM OF A WATERFALL' Sadie Benning first gained recognition as a wunderkind in the early 1990s when she exhibited videos made with a toy Fisher-Price Pixelvision camera that drew on her experiences as a lesbian teenager. In recent years Ms. Benning, now 34, has been distancing herself from video. This current show includes abstract works made with colored pencil that look like washed-out pieces by Joseph Albers, and a turntable and vinyl albums recorded by Ms. Benning from which you can choose your own soundtrack for the show. This isn't the kind of exhibition that would get an unknown artist noticed, but it is an assured demonstration of Ms. Benning's ethos of self-determination and D.I.Y. process. Orchard, 47 Orchard Street, Lower East Side, (212) 219-1061, orchard47.org, through Oct. 7. (Schwendener)
 'THE GEOMETRY OF HOPE: LATIN AMERICAN ABSTRACT ART FROM THE PATRICIA PHELPS DE CISNEROS COLLECTION' A must-see for anyone interested in modern art, this quietly groundbreaking show tells the story of postwar abstraction from a radically different angle: that of the Latin American artists who, starting in the 1940s, extended their possibilities without resorting to Surrealism. They delved into new materials before the Minimalists, gave Op art a helpfully physical twist, pushed form toward function (and performance) and generally opted for a dancing, off-kilter, open-ended geometry greatly at odds with the four-square machismo reductivism of many of their North American counterparts. Grey Art Gallery, New York University, 100 Washington Square East, at Waverly Place, Greenwich Village, (212) 988-6780, www.nyu.edu/greyart, through Dec. 8. (Smith)
 SEHER SHAH: 'JIHAD POP' This solo show by Seher Shah, who was born in Pakistan, focuses on the contradictions inherent in monumental symbols and the communality that underlies them: in a beautiful and intricate wall drawing, the black cube of the holy Kaaba in Mecca both opens to reveal a courtyard garden and unfolds to form a cross; Islamic ornament and graffiti become one. Other references are more difficult to read, but there's a lot going on here. Momenta Art, 359 Bedford Avenue, near South Fourth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 218-5058, momentaart.org, through Oct. 8. (Cotter)

 MAD. SQ. ART 2007: ROXY PAINE This installation is made up of two stainless-steel tree sculptures, ''Conjoined'' and ''Defunct,'' and a glacierlike boulder, ''Erratic,'' by Mr. Paine. The tree sculptures are made from thousands of pieces of metal pipe and rod elements that have been cut, welded and polished. They are real enough to resemble actual trees but not so real that they form a continuum with the surrounding foliage. What captures your immediate attention is ''Conjoined,'' a 40-by-45-foot sculpture of two trees whose gleaming steel branches cantilever and then improbably connect in midair. It is impossible to tell where the branches of one tree begin and the other's end. But the piece is also beautifully eccentric, a futuristic fantasy of streamlined vegetation manufactured in imitation of the real thing, only much more appealing and exciting. Madison Square Park, 23rd Street and Fifth Avenue, (212) 538-4689, madisonsquarepark.org, through Dec. 31. (Genocchio)

 'AMERICANS IN PARIS: ABSTRACT PAINTING IN THE FIFTIES' This show comes loaded with associations: Gertrude Stein and Hemingway, Gershwin's tone poem. Paintings here echo what was popular in New York in the 1950s. Although the canvases aren't as large, the gestures are big, and bold colors, splatters and drips abound in works by Al Held, Norman Bluhm, Seymour Boardman, Shirley Jaffe, Joan Mitchell and Sam Francis. One artist who ran against the Abstract Expressionist tide is Ellsworth Kelly, whose horizontal collage with hard-edged stripes makes him seem less like an American in Paris than a painter forecasting Daniel Buren -- or what the French would do in the 1960s. Tibor de Nagy, 724 Fifth Avenue, (212) 262-5050, tibordenagy.com; closes on Saturday. 
 (Schwendener)
 LAURA ANDERSON BARBATA: 'JUMBIE CAMP' This show looks like backstage at Carnivale, which is sort of what it is. The artist Laura Anderson Barbata -- born in Mexico City, now living in New York -- has converted the gallery into a temporary design-and-production workshop providing costumes for a stilt-dancing festival street theater known as moko jumbie. Galeria Ramis Barquet, 532 West 24th Street, (212) 675-3421, ramisbarquet.com; closes on Saturday. (Cotter)
 MATT KEEGAN: 'ANY DAY NOW' AND JEDEDIAH CAESAR: 'THREE VIEWS FROM SPACE' In side-by-side first shows at this gallery, two young artists appear to be diametric opposites. Making frequent use of an X-Acto knife, Matt Keegan favors surgical precision in various uses of language, complex printing and dry wall. Jedediah Caesar is big on dumb, random matter: quantities of trash compressed into large chunks of cast resin that are then sliced; they're balanced between beautiful and tacky. A great deal of oddly satisfying, intelligently focused details accumulate in the overlap between the artists. D'Amelio Terras, 525 West 22nd Street, (212) 352-9460, damelioterras.com; . (Smith)
 QUEENS MUSEUM OF ART: 'IL LEE: BALLPOINT DRAWINGS' A selection of drawings -- striking indigo and black ink abstractions, all done exclusively in ballpoint pen, on paper and canvas -- makes up this engrossing show by the veteran Korean artist Il Lee. The centerpiece is a 50-foot drawing that took two and a half months and 400 to 500 ballpoint pens to complete, with the artist working on sections at a time that were propped up against the wall in his Brooklyn studio. It is a sweeping, rhythmical abstraction in blue, recalling the Italian Futurist paintings of Giacomo Balla, combined with elements of traditional Asian ink and wash painting. Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, (718) 592-9700, queensmuseum.org; closes on Sunday. (Genocchio)
 TRACEY ROSE A video re-enactment of a panel presentation cum performance at the Brooklyn Museum last spring finds Tracey Rose lambasting the Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art. The charge? Lack of representation of nonwhite artists and theorists. The substance of Ms. Rose's performance isn't new. Artists and writers have long accused second-wave feminism of focusing on gender disparities while ignoring race and class. (''It was a movement for white women,'' Ms. Rose says. ''They said they were fighting men, but they give birth to white men, they marry them ...'' and so on.) While Ms. Rose's presentation might not make for great art, it makes for good dialogue. The Project, 37 West 57th Street, (212) 688-1585, elproyecto.com; closes on Saturday. (Schwendener)
 'SUPER PHAT' Despite the obvious pun in the title, Takashi Murkami, who organized a trilogy of shows in the last decade titled ''Superflat,'' isn't cited anywhere in ''Super Phat,'' a showcase of work by School of Visual Arts alumni, both Japanese and living in Japan. Much of what is here is like a sanitized, less complicated version of what appeared in the ''Superflat'' shows, with nods to manga, anime, otaku culture and kawaii, or ''cuteness.'' A school-sponsored show presents obvious challenges. But the safe approach taken here revives old questions of whether the academy tames or unleashes creativity. For where Murakami's vision was riveting, disturbing and revelatory, ''Super Phat'' is disappointingly bland. Visual Arts Gallery, 601 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 592-2145, schoolofvisualarts.edu; closes on Saturday. (Schwendener)

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

DATELINE: SARASOTA, Fla. 

 BODY:
Michael C. Jensen was an early inventor of bigger-than-life compensation packages for corporate chief executives, and nearly 20 years later, he still believes passionately in the concept of ''pay for performance'' that he championed.
 But along the way more than a few things went wrong, Mr. Jensen acknowledges, and now he is trying to find ways to fix the flaws that, in his evolving view, often allow mediocre chief executives -- even outright failures -- to become fabulously rich.
 ''There are all kinds of mistakes, and we can do a lot better,'' Mr. Jensen, a professor emeritus at Harvard's Graduate School of Business, said in an interview at his modernistic home on Siesta Key, with its huge picture windows overlooking the Gulf of Mexico some 40 feet away. It is one of two luxury houses -- the other is in Sharon, Vt. -- that reflect an academic life marked by success not just in scholarly pursuits but as a business consultant and popular speaker as well. 
 The repair work that Mr. Jensen and his co-author, Kevin J. Murphy, an economist and business school professor at the University of Southern California, are proposing in ''C.E.O. Pay and What to Do About It,'' due early next year from Harvard Business School Press, would require corporate boards to negotiate much tougher contracts with their chief executives. But that is not going to be easy.
 ''Imposing the constraints that Michael Jensen has in mind,'' said Margaret Blair, a professor at Vanderbilt Law School and a specialist in corporate governance, ''runs contrary to the culture that has emerged in boardrooms over the last 20 years. Mr. Jensen himself is partly responsible for that culture.''
 Even as he seeks to tighten the reins on executives of publicly traded companies, Mr. Jensen applauds the rise of private equity firms. He argues that the managers of these operations are much better stewards of the public companies they acquire than the boards they replace. With their own money at stake, and huge debts to repay, these managers have greater incentive than elected directors to be tough on the chief executives they appoint. 
 ''My way of characterizing the major thing that's wrong with large public corporations in the United States: the C.E.O. has no boss,'' Mr. Jensen said. ''Private equity fixes that very well. The C.E.O. has a boss.'' 
 Still, whatever the shortcomings of pay for performance, the upheaval in governance that Mr. Jensen fathered has made large corporations much less ''ossified'' than they were a generation ago, Mr. Jensen said. He attributes the improvement in part to outsize performance rewards for chief executives, and the motivation such rewards inspire to improve profits and drive up the share price through various methods: reorganization, sharper marketing, innovation, outsourcing, layoffs.
 As competition has intensified, corporations have flourished, but not necessarily the communities in which they are located or the workers they employ. Those are shortcomings that Mr. Jensen considers an acceptable price to pay for an American economy that he believes has outstripped Japan and Europe in growth and prosperity.
 ''We've come a long way, and we are in fantastically good shape,'' Mr. Jensen said.
 The Jensen-Murphy proposals are arriving just as wage stagnation and income inequality, fed in part by soaring chief executive pay, enter the presidential election as thorny campaign issues. Adding fuel to the fire, two prominent chief executives who failed to drive up their company's share prices -- Henry A. McKinnell at Pfizer and Robert L. Nardelli at Home Depot -- nevertheless left with severance packages of $200 million or more apiece.
 Mr. Jensen and Mr. Murphy say they abhor such payoffs. In his research, Mr. Jensen found that in 44 percent of all contracts for chief executives, even those convicted of fraud or embezzlement cannot be fired without a severance payment. In 94 percent of the contracts, he said, they cannot be fired for unsatisfactory work without a big severance package.
 ''How in the world can compensation committees sign these contracts?'' Mr. Jensen asked. ''They are breaching their fiduciary responsibility. It is a scandal of major proportions, and it is hidden.''
 At the same time, too many chief executives are well-paid without creating value, according to Mr. Jensen, who raises no objection to pay in the tens of millions as long as it is, by his standard, justly earned. One reason it is not: most such contracts fail to take into account the cost of capital, by which Mr. Jensen means the return that, on average, a shareholder would earn from putting his money into a different, similarly risky investment. 
 Say the cost of capital is 10 percent and a chief executive holds a bundle of options acquired when a share was worth $100. The share goes to $108, allowing the executive to exercise his options, earning $8 a share. But he has not created any real value, Mr. Jensen argues; he has shortchanged the shareholder, who would have come away with $110 if he had put $100 into a reasonable alternative. 
 ''I would never award the standard executive stock option again,'' Mr. Jensen declared, acknowledging that he had failed to take cost of capital into account in his original formulation of pay for performance. 
 Mr. Jensen would also require chief executives to pay for their options, forcing them to focus on creating value or risk losing their own money. The option with the $100 strike price should cost the chief executive $10, he said. If the stock then rose to $110, a chief would not make any money for two reasons: the $10 cost of capital and the $10 paid to purchase the option. That money would not be returned if the option remained under water, not in the toughened compensation contracts that Mr. Jensen would write.
 ''So now you would have C.E.O.'s with skin in the game,'' he said. ''Skin in the game is important. You bet.'' 
 Still, for all its present shortcomings, Mr. Jensen believes deeply in the value of pay for performance, which he first explored in research with William L. Meckling in the 1970s, when both were economists at the University of Rochester's Graduate School of Management. A seminal article in the Harvard Business Review, written with Mr. Murphy in 1990, outlined the present system, in which a rising share price became the measure of a corporation's value. 
 Chief executives were in the key position to increase shareholder value, Mr. Jensen and Mr. Murphy wrote, and their pay, therefore, should be tied to the stock price, through option awards and outright stock grants by independent boards.
 Thus pay for performance got rolling, eclipsing six-figure annual salaries and cash bonuses, until then the standard. And as the new payoffs multiplied -- taking on a life of their own as companies ratcheted up the bidding for executive talent -- so did the criticism. 
 ''Jensen seems fixated on the notion that the only way to get other benefits for society is to achieve shareholder value,'' said Jay W. Lorsch, a professor of human relations at Harvard's Graduate School of Business. ''You certainly want shareholder value, but over the long term. When you do it over the long term, other stakeholders -- the work force, for example -- must also be recognized and rewarded.''
 Professor Blair of Vanderbilt adds that pay for performance is too often just a windfall. She argues that many chief executives have simply been the lucky beneficiaries of a generally rising stock market, even if their own performances were not that great.
 While Mr. Jensen's proposals would go some way toward overcoming these objections, he sees even greater promise in the movement toward private ownership of large corporations. He welcomed the Chrysler buyout as a stark, unforgiving and necessary exercise in pay for performance.
 Cerberus Capital Management, the private equity firm headed by Stephen A. Feinberg, took on huge amounts of debt to take Chrysler private this summer, and installed Mr. Nardelli, the failed head of Home Depot, as the new chief executive.
 Mr. Nardelli's guidepost for generating value is not the stock price -- there is not any stock -- but whether he can make Chrysler profitable enough to keep up the payments on its debt and earn more than its cost of capital. And if he cannot, Mr. Jensen said, then he has to answer to only one person, Mr. Feinberg.
 To achieve those goals, Mr. Nardelli will almost inevitably turn to slashing costs, particularly labor costs. It is the sort of experience that Mr. Jensen and his father lived through in the 1960s and 1970s. 
 Both were printers in Minneapolis, members of the Typographical Workers Union. The son learned the trade in vocational high school and, upon graduation in 1957, went to work for a newspaper as a Linotype operator, intending to make that his life's work, just like his father.
 A teacher, however, talked Mr. Jensen into enrolling at Macalester College, in nearby St. Paul; in the end, working full time as a printer became a means of supporting himself through 11 years of college and graduate school at the University of Chicago. 
 During these years, new technology put Linotype operators out of business. Mr. Jensen made the leap to a new career. In the process he hardened himself, by his own account, to the plight of workers whose skills, like those of the Linotype operators, were no longer worth their wages. 
 Listening to Mr. Jensen's story, it is plain that he generated plenty of value as an academic in a career shaped in part by his experiences as a printer.
 But his father did not make it into comfortable retirement. 
 ''I had learned all this stuff about economics,'' Mr. Jensen said, ''and I remember several conversations in which I told him, 'Dad, you can't count on anything coming back to you from the union pension fund.' And he got very angry at me for telling him the union would let him down.''
 But it did. The pension fund failed to deliver the promised amount, Mr. Jensen said, and ''in their old age, I supported my parents.''

HEADLINE: Death and Texas

BYLINE: By BEN BRANTLEY

 BODY:
When death comes to dinner in ''Dividing the Estate,'' the deeply funny play by Horton Foote at 59E59 Theaters, nobody treats the old scythe swinger with much respect. Of course there's the obligatory pressing of hands, solemn hugging and exchanging of choked-up pieties when a loved one gives up the ghost during family mealtime, an occurrence that happens twice.
 But for the Texas clan of malcontents embodied with such itchy exuberance in the Primary Stages production that opened last night, directed by Michael Wilson, death is anything but ennobling.
 Quarrelsome, greedy, gossipy and small-minded: what has always defined the Gordons of Harrison, Tex., glows all the brighter in the shadow of mortality. As Mr. Foote sees it, in the midst of death we are inescapably in life, with all its attendant pettiness. 
 Mr. Foote was clearly in close contact with his comic muse when he wrote ''Estate,'' which is having its New York premiere. During a career that spans at least 60 plays, most of them set in the claustrophobic Texas town of Harrison, Mr. Foote, now 91, has created many works that find the mordant humor in people's inability to wrest what they want out of life. 
 But usually -- as with ''The Young Man From Atlanta,'' his Pulitzer Prize winner from 1995, and ''The Day Emily Married,'' produced by Primary Stages in 2004 -- the balance in his work tips toward a tone of laconic lamentation. 
 In ''Dividing the Estate,'' he shifts the weight to comedy with sprightly confidence. If Mr. Wilson's production, which features an ensemble led by Elizabeth Ashley as the matriarch of the Gordons, doesn't yet possess the same authority, it earns its laughs honestly. And it makes it clear that Mr. Foote's authorial gaze is focused with satiric sharpness while retaining its elegiac sense of life's transience.
 Mr. Foote's plots are almost always propelled by the frustrating of his characters' deepest desires; his plays are all about being thwarted, which for him is the basic existential condition. Mostly what his characters want is simply a home of their own. (The title of his ambitious, generations-spanning ''Orphan's Home Cycle'' of plays suggests just how futile that longing is.)
 In ''Dividing the Estate,'' home has an undeniable physical reality, but for most of those who inhabit it, it's more prison than sanctuary. (There's a grim appropriateness about the institutional pristineness of Jeff Cowie's set.) One of the few grand houses still standing in good repair in time-shrunken Harrison in 1987, it is ruled by the octogenarian Stella (Ms. Ashley), who keeps her aging children on a short financial leash. Understandably, they are starting to chafe.
 The subject that preoccupies the Gordons in ''Dividing the Estate'' is exactly what its title promises. Stella's fluttery daughter Lucille (Penny Fuller) -- whose middle-aged son, known in typical Hortonese as Son (Devon Abner), manages the estate -- is more or less content with the status quo. But her other children, Lewis (Gerald McRaney) and Mary Jo (the incomparable Hallie Foote), are making noises about wanting their economic independence.
 In outline this plot is familiar, bringing to mind an assortment of American dramas set in the South and steamy with avarice and mendacity, from Lillian Hellman's ''Little Foxes'' to Tennessee Williams's ''Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.'' What makes ''Estate'' so unmistakably a work of Horton Foote is the endearing ineffectuality of its schemers and the suggestion that the treasure chest everyone is after may be empty. Imagine Hellman's foxes declawed, an alteration that automatically turns melodrama into comedy.
 ''Dividing the Estate'' doesn't have the mechanical precision of Hellman's plotting. Mr. Foote has so many chickens coming home to roost all at once in the second act that the Gordon homestead starts to sound like an overpopulated henhouse. 
 Yet the authenticity of tone, poised like life between slapstick and tragedy, doesn't falter. As always with Mr. Foote, even big events are folded into a conversational style that meanders like a lazy river, giving as much emphasis to the mundane as the monumental.
 For a Southern-bred boy like me, listening to that talk really is like returning to my youth. If you haven't been around such conversation, you won't appreciate the exquisite accuracy of the maddening debates about genealogy and hymns, anecdotes about dietary quirks and questions like ''Was she drunk when she had the accident?,'' asked with genteel prurience.
 That particular question is posed by Ms. Ashley, who has the requisite inflections down cold. She also nails the mixture of maternal indulgence and selfishness that makes Stella such a trial to her descendants. One caveat: She looks more like the sister than the mother of her children, and there are other instances of casting that seem confusingly age-inappropriate.
 While a few of the supporting performances fail to grasp the mannered musicality of the dialogue, those of Mr. McRaney, Ms. Fuller, Ms. Foote (the playwright's daughter) and Arthur French (as Doug, a 92-year-old family retainer) are first-rate. 
 As the alcoholic Lewis, Mr. McRaney, best known for his television work, beautifully combines the hangdog surliness and submissiveness that come from years of filial dependency. 
 Ms. Foote has appeared to splendid advantage in many of her father's works, often as a passive soul hamstrung by her good manners and obedience to social custom. Here she plays the most aggressively grasping of Stella's children with a mix of predatory fierceness and haplessness that becomes the play's comic soul. Her repetition of a single sentence in the final scene is a priceless summing up of the seriously funny sadness of the entire family.
 The sense of a way of life -- and life itself -- coming to an end, the sound of Baptist church chimes at midnight, pervades ''Dividing the Estate,'' as it does so much of Mr. Foote's work. And Mr. Wilson allows this awareness to hover and grow in well-placed silences of Chekhovian substance.
 Even as the culture that produced the Gordons disintegrates around them, though, Mr. Foote never denies the enduring vibrancy of their irritable and demanding natures. ''Everything will be different now,'' one character murmurs at the end of a scene. Not a chance. Which is bad news for him, but good news for theatergoers.

HEADLINE: Rural Waterfront Oasis That's Not Far From Town

BYLINE: By TIM NEVILLE

 BODY:
ON warm evenings, when the sunset bleeds across a humid sky and the lazy rivers turn pink as strawberries, the Delmarva Peninsula can put on a marvelous show. Bullfrogs hold concerts in ponds thick with lily pads. Barred owls drift through cypress trees that twinkle with lightning bugs, and fox pups wrestle in fields near chicken houses. Just two hours southeast of Baltimore, Delmarva can feel like an animated watercolor painted in broad strokes of haze and cordgrass.
 It's no wonder people want to move there. 
 For decades most of Delmarva, which spans Delaware, Maryland and Virginia (thus the name) drew little interest as a place to buy a vacation home or retire to the coast. A few resort towns, like Ocean City, Md., on the Atlantic Ocean and Easton, Md., on the Chesapeake Bay, have long been popular with the Beltway and Baltimore crowds, but most Delmarva communities -- many of them just minutes from beach or bay -- grew slowly. 
 That is changing. Once tired, drab towns on the middle and lower Eastern Shore of Maryland -- places like Cambridge, Crisfield and Snow Hill -- appear likely to double, even triple, in population over the next 15 to 20 years. Sussex County in southern Delaware has seen record rates for new construction, especially near the beach communities of Lewes and Rehoboth, though that is now slowing. On the Eastern Shore of Virginia, towns that had buildings literally falling into the streets now have theaters, art galleries and coffee shops.
 Prices have gone up -- very noticeably and shockingly to some local people -- but property on Delmarva remains inexpensive when compared with land on the more metropolitan western shores of Maryland and Virginia. 
 The peninsula, about 180 miles long and hemmed in by the Atlantic to the east and Chesapeake Bay, is one of the few places along the Eastern Seaboard where so much country living and solitude come packaged within easy reach of urban opportunity. Some 22 million people live less than 150 miles from Delmarva, though you'd never know it casting for croaker alone from the docks. Delmarva's population is 1.3 million -- about two Baltimores, spread across a flatland 73 times as big. 
 ''This area has to be one of the most pristine undeveloped waterfront places that's within a day's drive of so much of the country's population,'' said Bill Paige, 67, a former Social Security administrator who moved in 2005 into a 2,200-square-foot home with water views that he bought near Accomack, Va., for less than $300,000. ''I don't think people understand the value of quiet.''
 The proximity to wildlife still permeates everything. ''An eagle flew overhead and killed a seagull right in front of us,'' said Brenda Robinson, a 57-year-old accounting manager who, with her husband, Donald, bought a 1,300-square-foot town house on the Delmarva barrier island of Chincoteague, Va., for $205,000. The couple drive about two and a half hours each weekend from their home outside Annapolis to eat fresh fish, walk on the beach with wild ponies and go crabbing. Even as prices cool, home values are way up -- 60 and 70 percent increases over the last four years have been common. 
 Mrs. Robinson said two-bedroom, two-and-a-half-bathroom town houses like hers were now listed for $243,000, a 19 percent jump in one year. The median price for homes in much of Delmarva still hovers below $250,000, but that seems unlikely to last. Condos overlooking the Chesapeake in Crisfield, about 30 miles southwest of Salisbury, already sell for more than $1 million.
 ''Some of the prices in these places are unheard of,'' said Vernon Nily, a broker in Easton, articulating the local amazement as demand has picked up. ''People are now buying second homes in Vienna. You know Vienna?'' he asked, referring to a tiny Maryland town on the Nanticoke River. ''Most people don't. That's where you can get gas on the way to the beach.''
 Conflicts between economic development and preservation tug at Delmarva. As developers look to convert seaside areas into pricey communities, residents wonder whether a way can be found to preserve the peninsula's rural nature before things get too fancy. 
 One of those residents is Doug Nelson, who like many on Delmarva goes by a nickname -- Cheeseburger. A Crisfield native, he has watched six luxury waterfront condo buildings spring up in about five years around his restaurant, Gordon's, a diner popular with a dwindling population of watermen. ''Watermen have been dying out for years, but now developers wave a million bucks around to buy their land, and you can't blame them for taking it,'' he said. 
 For others, like Butch Lawson, a retired cargo-container businessman from Atlanta, Delmarva's face-lift supports a comfortable life. Mr. Lawson bought a 1,900-square-foot waterfront condo in Crisfield last year for $550,000. ''I sit out on my deck,'' he said, ''watch the sun go down over the water, and I play as much as possible, fishing and golfing every day.''
 The shifting tides in Delmarva are perhaps best illustrated in Cambridge, Md., once a bustling deep-water port along the Choptank River. After World War II, bay harvests dwindled and seafood-packing companies went bust. Unemployment hit 11 percent in the 1980s. John Nussear, the director of the Dorchester County Chamber of Commerce in 2002, remembers the town then. ''Sixty percent of the shops downtown were boarded up,'' he said. ''It wasn't an inviting area.''
 Now downtown buildings are largely occupied, and shiny multistory town houses with Palladian windows and boat slips are popping up along the once-decrepit waterfront. Brick sidewalks with gas lamps line main streets. Antiques shops and clothing boutiques stand next to a building dedicated to the life of Cambridge's most famous resident, Harriet Tubman, who was born nearby. Cambridge Grill serves espresso in what was formerly a men's clothing store. All the while, there in the distance, you can sometimes hear the faint peep-peep of an osprey circling its nest. 
 ''Cambridge has everything going for it,'' said Barbara Duffy, a 51-year-old pharmaceutical company worker who drives an hour and 50 minutes from her home in Wilmington, Del., to spend weekends in Cambridge. ''It's been here all along, but it just took someone with vision to see it. We're lucky it took so long because otherwise property would have been untouchable for us by now.''
 Ms. Duffy and her husband, Seth Braunstein, 62, a physician, recently bought a 1,841-square-foot waterfront condo with two bedrooms and two bathrooms in Cambridge's Deep Harbour development for $420,000. They can see the water from every room, and they've bought a 30-foot Islander Bahama sailboat. ''The price was right, the river is beautiful, and we can keep our boat right out front,'' Ms. Duffy said.
 Minutes away from downtown Cambridge, the Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge, a 27,000-acre expanse of sibilant cordgrass and murky channels, has one of the largest concentrations of nesting bald eagles along the Atlantic coast. Dorchester County, which contains Cambridge and Blackwater, has 1,700 miles of coastline along Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries. 
 The natural setting wasn't lost on Duane Zentgraf, a developer who proposed building a 2,700-unit resort community with an 18-hole golf course and a 100-room hotel on property close to the refuge. After a heated debate, Blackwater Resort Communities was scaled back about 75 percent to include 675 homes on 328 acres. ''We're facing a major balancing act, and we won't know if we've made the right decisions until 20 years from now,'' said Cleveland Rippons, also known as Rip, Cambridge's lively mayor. The town now has about 3,800 homes and plans to add about another 2,000 in coming years. ''People say, 'Mr. Mayor let him build them all. This is America,' or 'Mr. Mayor, don't let him build anything,' '' he said.
 Mark Odachowski, 37, hopes to break ground shortly on Summerfield, a 2,170-home development that will triple the population of Snow Hill (now 2,400) when complete, possibly in about 15 years. He's not fazed by the declining national real estate market. ''Twenty minutes from the beach, four miles from Chincoteague Bay and practically surrounded by Nature Conservancy land and a state park -- I'm very confident about this,'' he said. 
 David Stimmel, a kitchen designer from Pennsylvania, sees a different kind of opportunity. He and his wife spent $180,000 for three acres of land on Deal Island, where he plans to keep a beach cottage and studio, eat plenty of ''the freshest seafood around'' and enjoy a neighborhood that still feels friendly and rural. ''I know more of my neighbors' names here than I do in Philadelphia,'' he said, ''yet I've owned my home in Philly for 15 years.''
 Delmarva ''has that small-town feel,'' he added. ''Like Martha's Vineyard.''

HEADLINE: More Deaths In Myanmar, And Defiance

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS; Reporting was contributed by Steven Lee Myers from Washington, and by Warren Hoge, Graham Bowley and Christine Hauser from New York.

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Sept. 27 

 BODY:
Brutality and defiance marked the second day of an armed crackdown in Myanmar on Thursday as the military junta tried to crush a wave of nationwide protests in the face of harsh international condemnation.
 The violence began before dawn with raids on Buddhist monasteries and continued through the day with tear gas, beatings and volleys of gunfire in the streets of the country's main city, Yangon, according to witnesses and news agency reports from inside the closed nation.
 Witnesses said soldiers fired automatic weapons into a crowd of protesters. State television in Myanmar reported that nine people had been killed and that 11 demonstrators and 31 soldiers had been wounded. The numbers could not be independently verified, and exile groups said they could be much higher. The Japanese Embassy said one of the dead was a Japanese photographer, Kenji Nagai. 
 International pressure on Myanmar built when President Bush asked countries in the region with influence on Myanmar's authorities to urge them to cease using force, and the Treasury Department imposed economic sanctions on 14 identified senior Myanmar government officials. 
 China's foreign minister, Yang Jiechi, at the White House for a scheduled meeting on Thursday with the national security adviser, Stephen J. Hadley, soon found himself in an impromptu Oval Office session with the president. Mr. Bush urged Mr. Yang to have Beijing ''use its influence'' in Myanmar to facilitate a peaceful transition to democracy, said the White House spokesman, Gordon D. Johndroe. 
 As Myanmar's chief international patron, China blocked an effort on Wednesday by the United States and European countries to have the Security Council condemn the violent crackdown. On Thursday, while not going as far as Mr. Bush might have wished, China added its voice to criticism from abroad when it publicly called for restraint.
 ''As a neighbor, China is extremely concerned about the situation in Myanmar,'' the Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Jiang Yu, said at a news briefing in Beijing. ''China hopes that all parties in Myanmar exercise restraint and properly handle the current issue so as to ensure the situation there does not escalate and get complicated.''
 Despite a heavy military and police presence, protests gained momentum through the day in several parts of Yangon. 
 But with the authorities clamping down on telephone and Internet communications, human rights groups and exiles said they were having increasing difficulty in getting information. 
 The violence of the past two days has answered the question of whether the military would fire on Buddhist monks, the highly revered moral core of Burmese society. For the past 10 days, the monks have led demonstrations that grew to as many as 100,000 before the crackdown began.
 ''The military is the one who proudly claims to preserve and protect Buddhism in the country, but now they are killing the monks,'' said Aung Zaw, editor of The Irrawaddy, a magazine based in Thailand that has extensive contacts inside Myanmar.
 Like others monitoring the crisis, which began on Aug. 19 with scattered protests against steep fuel price increases, he said it was difficult to learn the numbers of dead in a chaotic situation in which hospital sources are sometimes reluctant to talk. Mr. Aung Zaw said he had been told of one death on Thursday when soldiers attacked two columns of monks and other people.
 ''The military trucks, I was told, just drove in, and soldiers jumped out and started shooting,'' he said, describing a scene that was reminiscent of the mass killings in 1988, when the current junta came to power after suppressing a similar peaceful public uprising. 
 The Treasury Department included Senior Gen. Than Shwe, who leads the junta in power in the country, in the list of officials on whom it will impose sanctions. The measures will freeze any assets that the officials hold within the United States and prohibit Americans from transacting or doing business with them.
 The foreign ministers of Myanmar's regional group, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, issued a strongly worded statement on Thursday saying they were ''appalled to receive reports of automatic weapons being used'' against demonstrators.
 The statement said that at a morning meeting at the United Nations, the officials from the 10-nation group had ''expressed their revulsion'' directly to Myanmar's foreign minister, U Nyan Win, ''over reports that the demonstrations in Myanmar are being suppressed by violent force and that there has been a number of fatalities.''
 The foreign ministers of Asean are at the United Nations for the opening of the General Assembly, and George Yeo, the foreign minister of Singapore, the chairman country, put out their statement.
 It said Mr. Nyan Win had given them assurances that Ibrahim Gambari, the special envoy whom Secretary General Ban Ki-moon sent Wednesday evening on an urgent mission to Myanmar, would be given a visa to enter the country once he arrived in Singapore. The statement said Myanmar should cooperate fully with Mr. Gambari and give him access to all parties. 
 ''Mr. Gambari's role as a neutral interlocutor among all the parties can help defuse the dangerous situation,'' it read.
 The statement called upon Myanmar to ''resume its efforts at national reconciliation with all parties concerned and work towards a peaceful transition to democracy.''
 It also called for the release of all political detainees, including Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the pro-democracy leader who has been held under house arrest for 12 of the last 18 years. 
 Superstitious Burmese had predicted violence on this date, whose digits add up repeatedly to the astrologically powerful number 9: the 27th day of the ninth month in 2007. 
 There was no indication that international pressure would have any more effect on the junta than it has had over two decades of political pressure or economic sanctions like those announced at the United Nations this week by Mr. Bush.
 ''The big missing piece of the puzzle is what is going on in the minds of the senior leadership,'' said Thant Myint-U, a former United Nations official who is the author of a book on Myanmar, formerly Burma, called ''River of Lost Footsteps: Histories of Burma.'' 
 ''Nothing that they have said in the last 20 years would suggest that they will back down,'' he said
 The government's actions in the past two days seemed to bear this out.
 In the raids early Thursday, The Associated Press reported, security forces fired shots at one of several monasteries, Ngwe Kyar Yan, where one monk said a number of monks were beaten and at least 70 of its 150 monks were arrested.
 A female lay disciple said a number of monks were arrested at Moe Gaung Monastery, which was being guarded, like a number of other monasteries, by a contingent of armed security personnel. 
 Other unconfirmed reports from exile groups described scenes of brutality and humiliation of monks and their superiors when soldiers entered the monasteries.
 ''We were told by a lot of residents that the soldiers came in very rudely and told them to kneel down,'' Mr. Aung Zaw said. ''Their senior abbot was beaten in front of the others. They were told to walk like dogs. That news quickly spread, and whether it is rumor or true, people got very, very angry.''
 Sunai Phasuk, a representative of Human Rights Watch in Thailand, said that he was concerned about the apparently large numbers of arrests ofmonks and lay people but that information about them was scarce.
 Like others seeking news from inside the country, he said that the mobile telephones of his sources had apparently been cut off. There were also reports that the authorities were closing Internet cafes, where people had been loading and transmitting images from their telephone cameras.
 ''We have lost all contacts inside Burma,'' he said. ''We cannot reach them any more.''

HEADLINE: Wal-Mart Prices Aim for Younger Medicine User

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE SAUL

 BODY:
On its face, the expansion of Wal-Mart's generic drug program yesterday seemed only incremental. The company added seven new compounds to the list of drugs it sells for $4. 
 But the announcement may give a glimpse of the future at Wal-Mart pharmacies. The company seems to be reaching out to a younger and broader drug clientele as it tries to expand its piece of the nation's $250 billion retail pharmaceutical market beyond its current share of 5 to 6 percent.
 Many of the drugs previously on the Wal-Mart plan were heart, high blood pressure and diabetes drugs commonly used by older people. 
 But yesterday, the company added to its $4 list methylphenidate, a drug for attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder that is commonly used for school-age children. 
 Perhaps more significant, Wal-Mart said it would start selling generic versions of two popular birth control pills for $9 a month, appealing to an estimated 11 million women in America, most of them under age 40, who use oral contraceptives. 
 A fertility drug, clomiphene, will also be available for $9, Wal-Mart said.
 Versions of the two birth control pills -- known by the brand names Ortho Cyclen and Ortho Tri-Cyclen -- account for 20 percent of oral contraception prescriptions in this country. 
 Although the average woman would save only $1 at Wal-Mart if she had insurance coverage for the pill, she would save $21 if she did not have coverage. The pills frequently sell for $30. 
 Establishing a new $9 price point for certain generic drugs may prove a crucial step, according to analysts, some of whom have considered Wal-Mart's pharmacies an underused asset. 
 ''What they've done here is, they've gotten a bit more aggressive in creating a second tier,'' said Ronny Gal, who follows the generic drug industry for Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. ''This is a very important development. Rather than just sell for $4 and be stuck with only the cheapest generics, they've now created a tier and they have a business model for more expensive generics, as well.'' 
 Mr. Gal predicted that the company might very well add more drugs to the $9 list and, ultimately, create a third, higher-priced, tier.
 A Wal-Mart senior vice president, John Agwunobi, said that there was more to come, adding that the company planned to ''grow the program and continue it into the future.'' 
 Wal-Mart announced the program's expansion yesterday, just over a year after introducing the $4 generic plan. The discounts have prompted similar steps by many other retailers, including Target, which said yesterday that it would match Wal-Mart's latest moves. 
 Government economists recently credited the discount pricing plans with contributing to a slowdown of inflation in the Consumer Price Index for prescription drugs, which is currently running at about 1 percent, a three-decade low. 
 Still, two of the nation's largest prescription drug retailers, Walgreens and CVS, have said the Wal-Mart promotions have not affected their businesses and they have not matched the discount prices.
 A spokeswoman for Walgreens said yesterday that the company's share of the nation's retail pharmaceutical market had increased a percentage point, to 17 percent, since the Wal-Mart $4 plan began last year. 
 In a conference call with the media and investment analysts yesterday, Wal-Mart's chief operating officer, Bill Simon, estimated that the company has saved individual shoppers and the nation's overall health care system $610 million since the program began last year. 
 In all, the company said its generic plan would now cover 361 prescriptions representing various formulations of 157 medications, an increase of about 24 prescriptions.
 Wal-Mart said its $4 program now covered about 40 percent of the prescription drugs sold at its Wal-Mart, Sam's Club and Neighborhood Market pharmacies. 
 Wal-Mart has sought competitive bids from generic makers for at least some of the products, enabling it to still make money while selling the generics for $4. 
 Two of the drugs the company added to its list yesterday -- versions of the heart medication Coreg and the nail-fungus drug Lamisil -- only recently became available as generics. 
 Generic drugs are typically sold at small discounts just after their approval before falling to as low as 10 percent of the original brand-name drug cost a year or so later. In this case, however, generic versions of both Coreg and Lamisil have been heavily discounted early because of competition among the numerous generic manufacturers that received Food and Drug Administration approval to sell them. 
 Coreg, used to treat congestive heart failure and hypertension, became available in this country as a generic drug this month. Wal-Mart, which said the brand-name version had been $119 just a month ago, said that its inclusion on the $4 list meant that customers would be saving $115 a prescription. 
 The generic version of Coreg -- made by more than a dozen manufacturers -- is widely available from various Internet sources at retail prices from $37 to $102. 
 Wal-Mart said that savings on the generic version of Lamisil would be extensive, comparing its $4 price with an average price a month ago of $337 for the branded version. Lamisil, however, has been available as a generic since July. Some retailers were selling it this week for as low as $45.

HEADLINE: Hope for Another Rate Cut Lifts Shares

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
The stock market rose yesterday as investors speculated that a drop in new home sales would give the Federal Reserve more reason to lower interest rates.
 The SLM Corporation, the student loan company also known as Sallie Mae, posted its biggest rally in five months on expectations that it would negotiate a new takeover agreement. 
 Exxon Mobil and Chevron climbed after crude oil prices increased for a second day. Morgan Stanley and Citigroup helped lead financial shares to their steepest gain since the Fed cut its benchmark rate on Sept. 18.
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index added 5.96, or 0.4 percent, to 1,531.38. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 34.79, or 0.25 percent, to 13,912.94. The Nasdaq composite index advanced 10.56, or 0.4 percent, to 2,709.59. The Russell 2000 index, a benchmark for companies with a median market value of $647 million, gained 0.6 percent, to 814.01.
 About 1.2 billion shares changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange.
 The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note declined 0.06 percentage point, to 4.56 percent. The price of the 10-year note rose 14/32, to 101 14/32.
 The dollar traded near an all-time low against the euro. The dollar fell 0.1 percent to $1.4147 per euro at 4:11 p.m. in New York after touching $1.4189, the lowest since the euro's debut in January 1999.
 SLM rallied $4.11, or 9.1 percent, to $49.12. Friedman Billings Ramsey & Company reiterated its outperform rating on the lender, saying it did not expect a buyout group led by J. C. Flowers & Company to walk away from the takeover even after telling the company on Wednesday it was no longer willing to pay $60 a share.
 Citigroup, the largest United States bank, added 33 cents, to $46.88. Morgan Stanley climbed $1.58 to $64.55.
 Energy shares in the S.& P. 500 advanced 1 percent as a group. Crude oil for November delivery gained 3.2 percent, to $82.88 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

 Purchases of new homes declined 8.3 percent to an annual pace of 795,000 in August, the lowest level in more than seven years, the Commerce Department said yesterday. The median price dropped 7.5 percent from August 2006.
 Wyeth, Lockheed Martin and ConAgra Foods climbed after saying they planned to return cash to shareholders by raising their dividends and buying back stock. Wyeth, the drug maker, climbed 9 cents, to $44.79. Lockheed, the world's largest defense company, gained $1.07, to $106.79. ConAgra gained 39 cents, to $25.82.

 Bear Stearns retreated $2, to $121, after CNBC said the investor Warren E. Buffett was not in talks about acquiring a stake in the securities firm. The New York Times had reported that Bear Stearns was in discussions with several outside investors, including Mr. Buffett, to sell up to 20 percent of the firm.
 Following are the results of yesterday's auction of five-year Treasury notes.

HEADLINE: I.M.F. Faces A Question Of Identity

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 27 

 BODY:
A decade ago, the International Monetary Fund helped to stabilize the world economy after markets collapsed in Latin America, Russia and Asia. Though critics often have rued its interventionism, the fund was widely hailed as a heroic guardian of the global financial system.
 Today, the only crisis faced by the I.M.F. is a crisis of identity. Countries rescued in the 1990s have mostly repaid their debts. With a shrunken loan portfolio, the institution that lectures others about finances has lost operating income and is running a deficit. It faces cuts in its staff and salaries and is even considering the sale of its gold bullion reserves.
 ''What might be at stake today is the very existence of the I.M.F. as the major institution providing financial stability to the world, a global public good,'' Dominique Strauss-Kahn, a former French finance minister, told the fund's directors last week. ''In sum, the two main issues are relevance and legitimacy.''
 On Friday, Mr. Strauss-Kahn is to be named the new managing director of the I.M.F., succeeding Rodrigo de Rato of Spain, who is resigning. He arrives at a time when the Bush administration, which backed him for the job, has joined a global chorus calling on the fund to rethink its priorities and its governance. 
 Beyond these difficulties is the question of whether an institution established in the 1940s in an era of fixed exchange rates and capital controls has a role to play in an era when trillions of dollars flow across borders every day. With its $300 billion in reserves and credit lines, it hardly has the resources to cope with a major crisis.
 In speeches, Mr. de Rato has said that, with its role in bailing out countries fading, the fund's new priorities should be in urging countries to take actions to prevent crises, monitoring the global economy and providing technical assistance. Fund officials say that Mr. Strauss-Kahn is likely to continue these.
 But his most immediate problems may be the budget of the I.M.F. itself, which is facing staff cuts and possible benefit and salary cuts for its 4,000 employees around the world. The fund holds 103 million ounces of gold reserves, worth close to $70 billion, accumulated over the years. It is considering selling some of that to meet budget needs.
 Sales of gold are controversial, with many donor countries saying that the gold belongs to them, not the I.M.F.
 Not least among the other issues to be considered is the way the world's wealthiest countries choose the fund's leader. Since the fund was established after World War II as part of the Bretton Woods postwar economic architecture, its chief is chosen in private by the leading powers in Europe.
 After President Nicolas Sarkozy of France nominated Mr. Strauss-Kahn last summer, his selection was a foregone conclusion, just as it was inevitable that President Bush would get his way in picking Robert B. Zoellick this summer to head the World Bank after the ouster of Paul D. Wolfowitz.
 But there is widespread unhappiness and embarrassment among the fund's board members over the clubby nature of the process, especially among the countries in Asia and Latin America bailed out in the 1990s. Many are now export powerhouses sitting on such huge reserves that they no longer need or want the fund telling them what to do.
 There are lingering feelings among some board members, especially in the developing world, that the fund joined with the United States and other wealthy countries in demanding overly austere budget cuts and other fiscal tightenings for the countries that were bailed out in the previous decade. 
 Russia hoped to capitalize on these feelings by challenging the selection of Mr. Strauss-Kahn. It nominated its own candidate, Josef Tosovsky, a former prime minister of the Czech Republic, who told the board that as a ''representative of an emerging market transition economy,'' he would bring a different perspective to the job.
 Aleksei Mozhin, the director who represents Russia at the fund, said his country was ''very, very proud'' to nominate Mr. Tosovsky. ''It is an open secret that the fund is barely alive,'' he added. ''It is in the business of survival. The traditional modus operandi of the fund -- you need our money, we tell you what to do -- is gone.''
 Last year, with American backing, the fund agreed to give more voting shares to China, South Korea, Turkey and Mexico. A plan to further expand the voting shares of these and other emerging economies is still being debated. The Bush administration fears that if such steps are not taken, these countries may break away from the fund.
 The administration has also gotten the fund to do more to monitor currency manipulations by trading partner countries, especially China, which Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. has accused of buying dollars to keep the value of its currency low so that its exports can be sold more cheaply in the United States.
 As a result of American and European pressure, a panel set up by Mr. de Rato called on China to end its currency interventions earlier this year. It also called on Europe to deregulate its economy and on the United States to do more to close its looming fiscal deficits in the coming decades.
 Mr. Paulson has made little secret of his desire for the fund to be more aggressive in pressing China. Treasury officials were irritated this year when Mr. de Rato said he could not lecture China any more than he could lecture Mr. Bush about the projected cost of Social Security and Medicare.
 ''We're satisfied that there has been progress on the currency issue,'' said Clay Lowery, an assistant secretary of treasury for international affairs. ''But more needs to be done for the I.M.F. to be as relevant as it has been in the past.''
 If the fund concentrates solely on monitoring economies and seeking greater disclosure in the world financial system, that would suit some of its critics well. Adam Lerrick, an economist at Carnegie Mellon University and the American Enterprise Institute, is among those who say that the I.M.F. needs to rethink its role in that direction. 
 ''Without radical reform, the I.M.F. will soon be totally irrelevant,'' he said. ''The fund should focus on data gathering and the dissemination of financial information. Surprise causes financial crises. The more information markets have, the less likely there will be a crisis.''
 But many experts also warn that the fund should be kept healthy in order to play a role in a future global crisis, even if rescue operations have to be carried out by other players with larger pools of reserves.
 ''It worries me a lot when people say the I.M.F. can just go away,'' said Anne O. Krueger, a former first deputy managing director of the fund and now a professor of economics at Johns Hopkins University. ''You have to think of the fund as something of an insurance policy for the member countries,'' she added. 
 ''Times are good right now. But there are so many important economic issues that can't be done bilaterally any more. Big countries and small countries recognize that they need the fund.''

HEADLINE: Runaway (Spending) Train

 BODY:
If, as he says, President Bush is going to start withdrawing troops from Iraq, why on earth does he need vastly more money from Congress to wage war? The staggering, ever escalating numbers tell the real story: As long as it's up to Mr. Bush, the American presence in Iraq will be endless and ever more costly, diverting resources from other national priorities that are being ignored or shortchanged. 
 The administration showed its cards on Wednesday when it asked Congress for an additional $42.3 billion in ''emergency'' funding for Iraq and Afghanistan. This comes on top of the original 2008 spending request, which was made before Mr. Bush announced his so-called ''new strategy'' of partial withdrawal. It would bring the 2008 war bill to nearly $190 billion, the largest single-year total for the wars and an increase of 15 percent from 2007. 
 And here are a few more facts to put the voracious war machine in context: By year's end, the cost for both conflicts since Sept. 11, 2001, is projected to reach more than $800 billion. Iraq alone has cost the United States more in inflation-adjusted dollars than the Gulf War and the Korean War and will probably surpass the Vietnam War by the end of next year, according to the nonpartisan Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments.
 For officials and politicians used to dealing with eye-popping numbers, the additional $42.3 billion may just register as a few more zeros on the bottom line of a staggeringly big bill. But it's more than enough to cover the five-year $35 billion proposal for children's health-care coverage that Mr. Bush has threatened to veto. 
 This for a war that former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld once said would cost under $50 billion while his deputy, Paul Wolfowitz, predicted Iraqi oil revenues would largely pay for Iraq's reconstruction.
 It's not that Americans don't want to pay and equip the courageous men and women who defend their freedom. In fact, since 9/11, taxpayers have been remarkably stalwart in underwriting massive war-fighting increases. But the Pentagon budget has to make sense within the larger context of national security. Mr. Bush seems to be placing no financial check whatsoever on military spending, most of it devoted to a war in Iraq that is peripheral to the fight against the Taliban and Al Qaeda, who are most active in Afghanistan and Pakistan.
 Americans also should ask why the Pentagon should be entrusted with more tax dollars when it can't seem to spend what it has wisely. Military officials recently revealed that contracts worth more than $90 billion are being investigated -- $6 billion for possible criminal charges, the rest for financial irregularities. According to the vague details made public, the new money would pay for the continued American troop presence in Iraq, the purchase of armored vehicles and training Iraq's new army. But it also contains funds for longer-term goals, such as replacing outdated equipment. 
 Congress must dissect this request carefully, find out why Mr. Bush suddenly needed to ask for the extra money and use the chance to reshape the failed strategy in Iraq. In other words, lawmakers should join Democrat Robert C. Byrd, chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, in pledging there will be ''no more blank checks for Iraq.''

HEADLINE: At Its Session on Warming, U.S. Is Seen to Stand Apart

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 27 

 BODY:
The White House convened a two-day conference of the world's major greenhouse-gas-emitting nations here on Thursday that served to highlight how isolated the Bush administration is on the issue of global warming.
 Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice acknowledged that climate change was a real global problem, and that the United States was a major contributor. She said the United States was willing to lead the international effort to reduce emissions of gases that had led to the warming of the planet, with the attendant ill effects. 
 But she repeated President Bush's insistence that the solution could not starve emerging economies of fuel or slow the growth of the advanced nations. ''Every country will make its own decisions,'' she said, ''reflecting its own needs and interests.''
 Mr. Bush is scheduled to address the meeting on Friday.
 Many delegates from the 16 nations at the conference expressed skepticism about the administration's motives, fearing that Mr. Bush was trying to derail a global emissions-reduction program managed by the United Nations.
 European delegates, in particular, rejected the administration's insistence that any plan to reduce emissions be voluntary and devised by individual nations rather than as a part of a worldwide treaty. One European representative, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he did not wish to publicly embarrass the host, called the meeting a ''game'' played by the administration to slow momentum toward an international pact.
 John Ashton, a special adviser on climate change to the British foreign secretary, called voluntary measures ineffective. Dozens of nations had agreed to nonbinding goals for emissions cuts in 1992, he said, then watched the pollutants linked to global warming rise at a double-digit percentile rate over the next decade.
 ''A voluntary approach to reducing greenhouse gases is hardly likely to be more effective than voluntary speed limits on the roads,'' he said. 
 James L. Connaughton, chairman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality, said that the meeting was intended to supplement, not supplant, the United Nations process. The organization will sponsor a global conference in Indonesia in December to work toward a new treaty to replace the Kyoto Protocol on climate change, which expires in 2012 and has never been accepted by the United States.
 ''The goal of our discussions here today is to do what we can to reinforce and to accelerate progress in the United Nations,'' Mr. Connaughton said.
 The conference drew only midlevel officials from many participating nations, which included Australia, Britain, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, Russia and South Africa. Also attending were dozens of nongovernmental observers.
 Yu Jie, an environmental advocate from China, expressed frustration with efforts by the industrialized nations to impose an emissions plan on her country, which is passing the United States as the world's largest producer of greenhouse gases. China, she said, was already taking steps to tax sport utility vehicles, close dirty coal-burning plants and expand use of renewable energy sources.
 ''China should not be blamed just because of its development,'' she said, echoing her government's position. ''They will follow if the European Union and the United States lead.''
 Germany's environment minister, Sigmar Gabriel, took a detached view of the conference, noting that the Bush administration would be gone in less than 18 months, and that it was unlikely to change its position. He said he spent two days this week discussing climate change with Democrats in Congress with an eye toward the post-Bush future.
 ''The good news is we are negotiating and the administration is willing to negotiate,'' he said. ''The difficult news is that we are on opposite sides on questions of substance.''

HEADLINE: Still Seeing Bargains, Selectively

BYLINE: By CONRAD DE AENLLE

 BODY:
THE Federal Reserve's interest rate cut has given fresh momentum to the stock market, but that could make buying opportunities harder to come by. Still, fund managers say they are finding companies that offer solid growth prospects at a decent valuation.
 Other than the stock pickers' admiration, the selections have little in common. Some companies are small and virtually unheard-of; others are among the largest on earth. 
 FedEx is the choice of Randy Haase, manager of the Baron Fifth Avenue Growth fund. Shares of the package-delivery service are trading down for the year, a result of subdued earnings growth as the company finances a costly program to improve its infrastructure in the United States, China and India.
 Once that is out of the way, in the next couple of years, its profits should resume rising in percentages in the mid- to upper teens, he predicted. Such growth would make the stock cheap at its recent valuation of 13 times the earnings that analysts forecast for next year, he said.
 John Osterweis, manager of the Osterweis fund, likes Genworth Financial, an insurance company whose stock has been hammered -- unreasonably, in his opinion -- because a small portion of its business involves underwriting mortgage insurance. The stock recently traded at barely more than the intrinsic worth of Genworth's assets and 10 times current earnings, and the woes in the mortgage industry could give the company cover to raise its rates, he said.
 Robert Lloyd, lead manager of the AIM Summit fund, likes a company whose stock has been shunned lately: Intuit, the maker of tax-preparation software.
 ''It's a good bread-and-butter business, with good fundamentals and cash flow,'' he said. ''Even if we have a consumer recession and corporate America pulled back on spending, people are still going to have to file their taxes.''
 Attending trade shows may not have the same urgency, but Jim Tringas, a manager of small- and mid-capitalization funds for Evergreen Investments, says business will be good enough to make the stock of Viad, a provider of exhibition booths and related services, worth owning.
 Viad was sold heavily by hedge funds that had owned it and needed to raise cash during the mini-panic last month in the credit markets, he said. Viad trades at 16 times estimates of 2008 earnings, and it has $6 of cash per share on its balance sheet; the company plans to return a portion of that to shareholders via a stock buyback.
 Mr. Tringas noted that small-capitalization stocks have fared worse than the large caps this year, which in his view makes smaller companies better values.
 The selection of Barbara Walchli, manager of the Aquila Rocky Mountain fund, is a health care stock -- sort of. In recommending Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory, she referred to a report this month from the Mayo Clinic promoting the therapeutic value of dark chocolate.
 Whichever virtues of chocolate consumers find appealing, they are buying enough to have sent the company's earnings up 220 percent over three years, yet the stock is trading around where it was in early 2005.
 NO small caps for Robert Gendelman, manager of the Legg Mason Capital and Income fund. He prefers a venerable corporate giant, General Electric, whose fortunes seem to improve each time the dollar ticks lower.
 ''One of the benefits of a weaker currency is that companies that sell abroad are very competitive,'' he said. ''General Electric is a case in point.''
 The comparative weakness of small caps this year may persuade Mr. Tringas and Ms. Walchli that the best opportunities are at that end of the spectrum. But Mr. Gendelman points out that the story was different for most of the decade, one reason that he believes that blue chips like G.E. offer better prospects. 
 ''After small-cap and mid-cap stocks outperformed their large-cap brethren for the last five years, large-cap represents the best value in the market,'' he said. 
 ''They are valued extremely attractively given their growth prospects, particularly companies with strong balance sheets and diversified business models around the world.''

HEADLINE: Bigger Choreographic Reputations Don't Always Need Bigger Stages

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA LA ROCCO

 BODY:
Sept. 17 was a good day for Luciana Achugar, a choreographer known for smart, sensual dances that explore the nature of shared experience between audience and performer. 
 First she made her debut at the Joyce Theater, performing an excerpt from her 2004 work ''A Super Natural Return to Love'' at the New York Dance and Performance Awards, better known as the Bessies. Then she won a Bessie for creator/choreographer, for last year's seductive ensemble piece ''Exhausting Love at Danspace Project.'' 
 Ms. Achugar, who has shown her work at small, progressive theaters like Danspace Project and Dance Theater Workshop during her eight-year choreographic career, could leverage this recognition to move onto bigger stages. But only if she wants to. 
 ''I'm not interested in going larger and larger,'' Ms. Achugar said. Nor are many of today's most interesting choreographers, who are thoughtfully engaged in navigating, and subverting, viewer expectations. Among them are Tere O'Connor, whose new project, ''Rammed Earth,'' is at the Chocolate Factory in Long Island City, Queens, and John Jasperse, who will bring a new work to the Next Wave Festival at the Brooklyn Academy of Music next month.
 For reasons both artistic and economic, many contemporary choreographers have abandoned the idea of a hierarchical presentational model, one that begins in ''emerging choreographer'' samplers, extends through midsize theaters like the Joyce and then ascends to spaces like the Brooklyn Academy of Music.
 Next season Ms. Achugar is planning to perform in one of the Workshop's small upstairs studios. Beyond aesthetics, she said, her position has philosophical and political dimensions.
 ''It's against the supersizing mindset,'' she explained. ''Dance has this thing that is anti-consumerist or anti-capitalist. It's about the body, these relationships and these experiences'' between viewers and dancers. 
 Of course, even dance behemoths like American Ballet Theater and Mark Morris Dance Group see the benefits of intimate stages. Mr. Morris regularly shows smaller repertory pieces in his Brooklyn center, and next month Ballet Theater will celebrate its 10th anniversary performing at City Center -- a small stage compared with the cavernous Metropolitan Opera House, where the company has its spring seasons, but still a very traditional theatrical space, and one that many choreographers find frustratingly outmoded.
 ''I think, unfortunately, most dance on big stages looks exactly the same,'' Mr. O'Connor said. ''I often say it looks like a bunch of No. 2 pencils in an earthquake. Mostly what you see is the human form against the enormity of the space. That is the major message in most of those works; it's the major excitement in most of those works.'' 
 Viewers, he said, see this standardized message and not the choreographer's ''individual ideas.'' 
 Mr. O'Connor has worked on big proscenium stages, choreographing dances for companies like the Lyon Opera Ballet. But for the New York premiere of ''Rammed Earth'' he approached the Chocolate Factory, an alternative, artist-run space. 
 The piece, which is ripe with architectural metaphors, opened this month in a warehouse at the Philadelphia Live Arts Festival. At a studio showing in August, Mr. O'Connor discussed the idea of ''liquid space,'' which allows the piece to maintain its architectural integrity in widely varying places -- even, he said, a proscenium stage. 
 But it is difficult to imagine the work being as bewitching -- or as spatially smart -- in a traditional proscenium setting, particularly in the opening section, where the four performers dance around the viewers' chairs, unless Mr. O'Connor were to move the audience onto the stage as well, as Miguel Gutierrez did in his last work, ''Everyone.''
 The Chocolate Factory's artistic director, Brian Rogers, who was one of its founders in 2003, has been aggressively seeking to work with established theaters like Danspace Project, a co-presenter of ''Rammed Earth.'' He said choreographers' growing interest in alternative spaces corresponded to the rising cachet of series outside Manhattan, like Chez Bushwick in Brooklyn, and many younger people's lack of interest in traditional theatergoing. 
 ''Sitting in a chair for a fixed period of time, and being quiet and then applauding'' feels wrong to them, he explained. ''It does to me, too, which is why I have the kind of space that I have. It can be anything you want it to be. You can throw away, if you want to, or try to throw away, all of the preassociations that people have about what it means to go and see a show.''
 Mr. Jasperse, who ricochets between big and small stages, has been playing with these pre-associations for years. His 2003 work ''Just Two Dancers,'' in which viewers were instructed to hold mirrors to see dance happening throughout the theater, offered a critique of the new Dance Theater Workshop stage, whose traditional design, with wings and tiered seating, has struck many -- including the Workshop's current artistic director, Carla Peterson -- as limited and making too many assumptions about what kind of dance will be shown on it. 
 Mr. Jasperse's ''Misuse liable to prosecution,'' which opens at the Brooklyn Academy in October, will juxtapose his beautifully precise movement language with a mess of found -- or stolen -- junk. But the greater juxtaposition will be of institution and art.
 The academy's traditional ''physical architecture of two enormous proscenium theaters with really expensive union crews'' is at odds with the Next Wave mission of presenting experimental work, Mr. Jasperse said. But, he continued, this ''crazy tension'' can work to an artist's advantage.
 To present ''Misuse'' in an ''alternative, grungy environment'' would miss the point, he said. ''What's going to happen when we put that show in that theater?'' he asked. ''How do you manipulate the machine? It's there and it's designed to do a certain thing, but it doesn't necessarily mean you have to do that.''
 John Jasperse's ''Misuse liable to prosecution'' runs Oct. 31 to Nov. 3 at the BAM Harvey Theater, 651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene; (718) 636-4100. Luciana Achugar will next present work in New York on Feb. 15 and 16 at the Abrons Art Center, 466 Grand Street, at Pitt Street, Lower East Side; (212) 598-0400.

HEADLINE: Taiwan Plans To Produce Missiles Able To Hit China

BYLINE: By DAVID LAGUE

DATELINE: TAIPEI, Taiwan 

 BODY:
Faced with a threatening military buildup by China, an increasingly outgunned Taiwan is quietly pushing ahead with plans to develop missiles that could strike the mainland, defense and security experts say. 
 Taiwan successfully tested its first cruise missile with that kind of range this year, one that could send a nearly 900-pound warhead more than 600 miles, to targets as distant as Shanghai, military analysts said. 
 Some Taiwanese military specialists have argued for decades that Taiwan should develop offensive weapons, including missiles, as a deterrent to the mainland, which has threatened to attack the self-governing island if it moves toward formal independence. The Pentagon estimates that China has deployed 900 missiles across from Taiwan. 
 Senior military officials and lawmakers in the governing Democratic Progressive Party of President Chen Shui-bian have confirmed that the cruise missiles were under development. 
 They said these missiles were essential to Taiwan's defense because of China's soaring spending on weapons. 
 ''They want to make mainland China hesitate before launching any attack,'' said Andrei Chang, a Hong Kong-based expert on the Chinese and Taiwanese militaries and editor in chief of Kanwa Defense Review magazine. ''These missiles could not only destroy military targets, but financial and economic targets as well. 
 ''They want to create massive panic,'' he added. 
 There have also been unconfirmed news reports in Taiwan that the military is developing short-range ballistic missiles. Mr. Chen's independence-leaning administration refuses to comment on the existence of such a program. 
 At a time when Taipei has angered China with a decision to hold a referendum on the island's bid to rejoin the United Nations under the name of Taiwan, the deployment of missiles that could strike the mainland could further increase tensions. The Bush administration has signaled that it opposes Taiwan's developing such weapons.
 There were reports in the Taiwanese news media this month that, under pressure from Washington, the Chen administration had dropped plans to deploy surface-to-surface missiles on outlying Matsu island near the coast of Fujian Province, China. 
 Missiles deployed on Matsu would be able to strike targets on the mainland where China has concentrated air, missile and land forces opposite Taiwan. 
 Taiwan's military refused to comment, but Beijing this week reacted sharply to the reports. 
 ''We sternly warn the Taiwan authorities not to play with fire,'' Li Weiyi, a spokesman for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, told a regular news briefing on Wednesday, according to a report carried by the official Xinhua news agency. ''Whoever plays with fire will get burned.'' 
 But analysts believe it will be difficult for the Bush administration to restrain Taipei while China continues its rapid buildup of missiles that could strike military targets and vital infrastructure on Taiwan. 
 The American and Taiwanese militaries estimate that China adds up to 100 new missiles a year to those arrayed against the island. 
 ''Taiwan will go ahead,'' said Andrew Yang, secretary general of the Chinese Council of Advanced Policy Studies, a Taipei-based security policy institute. ''It sends a signal that Taiwan will not be sitting and waiting for Beijing to conduct a strike against Taiwan.'' 
 Mr. Chang, the Defense Review editor, and other experts are confident that the land attack cruise missile, the Hsiung Feng-2E, developed at the Taiwan military's Chungshan Institute of Science and Technology, could soon be in production after its test in February. 
 ''I am sure it is almost ready,'' Mr. Chang said. 
 But Mr. Yang and some other analysts held out the possibility that, despite the successful test, some of the reports about the new missile's capabilities could be exaggerated. 
 He said that the missile had been tested only to about 200 miles, a third of its theoretical maximum range. The shorter range would be enough only to reach coastal targets on the mainland. 
 But there was potential for improvement as development continued. 
 ''In five years' time, the range could be extended,'' he said.

HEADLINE: As Prices Soar, U.S. Food Aid Is Buying Less

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER

 BODY:
Soaring food prices, driven in part by demand for ethanol made from corn, have helped slash the amount of food aid the government buys to its lowest level in a decade, possibly resulting in more hungry people around the world this year. 
 The United States, the world's dominant donor, has purchased less than half the amount of food aid this year that it did in 2000, according to new data from the Department of Agriculture. 
 ''The people who are starving and have to rely on food aid, they will suffer,'' Jean Ziegler, who reports to the United Nations on hunger and food issues, said in an interview this week.
 Corn prices have fallen in recent months, but are still far higher than they were a year ago. Demand for ethanol has also indirectly driven the rising price of soybeans, as land that had been planted with soybeans shifted to corn. And wheat prices have skyrocketed, in large part because drought hurt production in Australia, a major producer, economists say. 
 The higher food prices have not only reduced the amount of American food aid for the hungry, but are also making it harder for the poorest people to buy food for themselves, economists and advocates for the hungry say.
 ''We fear the steady rise of food prices will hit those on the front lines of hunger the hardest,'' said Josette Sheeran, executive director of the United Nations World Food Program. The United States is the biggest contributor to the agency. 
 She warned that food aid spending would have to rise just to keep feeding the same number of people. But the appropriations bill for the coming year now moving through Congress does not promise any significant increases in the food aid budget. 
 The impact of rising food prices on food aid is part of a broader debate about the long-term impact on the world's poorest people of using food crops to make ethanol and other biofuels, a strategy that rich countries like the United States hope will eventually reduce dependence on Middle Eastern oil. 
 Some advocates for the poor say rising food prices could benefit poor farmers in developing countries, providing them with markets and decent prices for their crops. But others warn that the growing use of food crops to make fuel, especially if stoked by large subsidies in rich countries, could substantially increase food prices. That could push hundreds of millions more poor people into hunger, especially landless laborers and subsistence farmers, according to a recent article in Foreign Affairs magazine. The authors were Benjamin Senauer and C. Ford Runge, food policy analysts and professors at the University of Minnesota. 
 Production of food crops to make biofuels will also tend to favor growers with plenty of capital and large land holdings, they say, rather than small-scale, impoverished farmers lacking modern grain storage facilities in poor countries. ''The policies put in place are going to be crucial to whether the small producer and the people who live where hunger is concentrated can benefit,'' Mr. Senauer said. 
 But for now food aid is suffering, as are poor people in poor countries, economists say. And their situation may get even tougher next year, relief agencies warn. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization is projecting that low-income countries reliant on food imports, including most of sub-Saharan Africa, will see the amount they pay to import cereals rise 14 percent. 
 The world's ability to absorb fresh price shocks has shrunk along with food stocks. ''We're very worried,'' said Henri Josserand, who heads the organization's global information and early warning system. ''World food stocks are much smaller than they used to be.''
 The food aid declines may also continue. Catholic Relief Services, a major distributor of American food aid, has projected substantial increases in what the federal government pays for food aid next year, based on an analysis of the futures market for the wheat, corn and soybean products that are mainstays of aid. ''It's bad news and it's not just going to affect U.S. food aid, but food aid from every source,'' said Frank Orzechowski, a retired commodity trader who now advises Catholic Relief Services.
 This year's decline in food aid follows a period when the sharply escalating costs of shipping American-grown food aid to Africa and Asia already reduced the tonnage supplied. The United States Government Accountability Officementnd this year that the number of people being fed by American food aid had declined to 70 million in 2006 from 105 million in 2002, mainly because of rising transportation and logistical costs.
 Now food prices are also playing a role. New data from the Department of Agriculture show that the cost of food for the federal government's main food aid program, Food for Peace, rose 35 percent over the past two years. 
 The amount of food bought for American food aid programs has fallen to 2.4 million metric tons this year from 4 million metric tons in 2005 and 5.3 million metric tons in 2000. Thomas Melito, who supervised the Government Accountability Office's food aid investigation this year, called the escalating costs of food aid ''frightening.''
 ''In a situation where there are 850 million hungry people in the world and the program was only providing enough for 70 million people in 2006, the new totals will be even lower,'' he said. 
 Congress is considering changes to the food aid program as part of the omnibus farm bill that some economists and advocates for the hungry say would improve the efficiency of the program and allow it to feed more people. They point to a Bush administration proposal that would allow the government to use up to $300 million of the food aid budget to buy food in African countries close to hunger emergencies rather than shipping it from the United States on mainly American-flagged vessels as current law requires. 
 In his speech to the United Nations this week, President Bush said the proposal would speed delivery and help provide a market for poor farmers in developing countries.
 The House version of the farm bill includes no such provision. The Senate Agriculture Committee has not produced a farm bill. 
 ''To my mind, that's the way out of this pincer,'' said Emmy Simmons, an agricultural economist and retired senior manager at the United States Agency for International Development. 
 ''But the shipping guys are hanging tough,'' she added. ''They're defending that little chunk of revenue. They aren't super concerned whether you feed less people.''
 Groups representing shipping companies and agribusiness interests have opposed using the budget of the main food aid program to buy food in developing countries instead of relying on American food shipped overseas.
 Gloria Tosi, who represents most of the American ship owners involved in the food aid system, said buying commodities abroad would erode domestic political support for the program and lead to lower food aid budgets from Congress. She said it was ''politically naive'' to think the food commodity groups and ship owners that have for decades supported food aid in Congress would favor buying commodities abroad.
 ''None of us will be working toward that,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Consumer Spending Surpasses Forecasts

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
Americans made more purchases than expected in August and a crucial inflation indicator cooled, the Commerce Department said yesterday, two indications that the economy is still somewhat insulated from turmoil in the residential housing market.
 But lagging consumer confidence and uncertainty in the labor sector could point toward sluggish growth in the coming months, analysts warned as a tumultuous third quarter came to a close.
 Consumer spending rose a better-than-forecast 0.6 percent last month, the largest uptick since April, led by strong sales of durable goods. Income increased 0.3 percent, down from a 0.5 percent rise in July but in line with Wall Street forecasts. The rate of wage increases was also slightly down from July. 
 Separately, construction spending increased 0.2 percent in August after a 0.5 percent decline the month before, surprising many analysts who had predicted another drop. Nonresidential construction offset a decline in home building. 
 American business growth expanded in September as prices paid by producers dipped to the lowest level since January, according to the Chicago arm of the National Association of Purchasing Management, whose benchmark index of business activity rose to 54.2 this month, from 53.8 in August.
 ''There's a huge divergence in performance in this economy between the home-building sector, which is terrible, and everything else, which seems to be doing O.K.,'' said David Kelly, an economic adviser at Putnam Investments. ''Strong consumer spending for August, and the strong construction spending now, really tell us that outside of home building there is plenty of demand in the economy.''
 Consumers also caught a break on rising prices in August. A closely watched inflation gauge, the core personal consumption expenditure deflator, posted its smallest year-over-year gain since February 2004. The core deflator index, which excludes food and energy prices, rose 1.8 percent on an annual basis, continuing a downward trend that stretches back to February. 
 A sign of easing inflation could give the Federal Reserve, which lowered interest rates last week, more leeway for further cuts in the fourth quarter, a move some analysts say they believe is necessary to lessen the current credit squeeze. The economists who set monetary policy at the Fed typically like to see the index rise no more than 2 percent on an annual basis. 
 While this morning's reports were good news for a troubled economy, some analysts warned that the seasonal factors might be making the numbers misleading. 
 ''I think there's no chance of getting similar numbers for September, and a fair chance that this August increase will actually reverse,'' said Ian C. Shepherdson, the chief United States economist for High Frequency Economics, referring to the consumer spending and income reports.
 Mr. Shepherdson attributed the spending increase to a rise in purchases of durable goods, automobiles and weather-related services. ''We know the manufacturers offered pretty big incentives in August and boosted car sales because they're trying to get rid of the '07 models,'' he said.
 Stuart G. Hoffman, the chief economist at PNC Financial, said the inflation and spending numbers were encouraging in light of the summer's subprime troubles. ''There's probably going to be some leakage from the really weak and shattered housing market to consumer spending. But it doesn't look as though it's going to get flooded,'' he said.
 Other analysts said that a weakening job market could start to curb consumer income and spending in the months ahead.
 Faced with conflicting indicators -- home sales dropped sharply last month even as consumer spending increased -- many market watchers are turning their attention to next Friday's employment report, which they say will provide a clearer view of the impact of the mortgage crisis on the economy. Employers cut 4,000 jobs in August, the first monthly loss in four years.

HEADLINE: The Worst Investors? Humans

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA. 
E-mail: nocera@nytimes.com

 BODY:
I know I'm jumping the gun a little here, but do you realize that the 20th anniversary of the Crash of '87 is right around the corner?
 I'll never forget that day. It was Monday, Oct. 19, and I was in Boston, working on a story about Fidelity Investments for Esquire magazine. The article was the brainchild of Esquire's editor then, Lee Eisenberg, who had become fixated on the country's obsession with the bull market that had begun in 1982.
 There is something new going on, I remember Lee saying, and he was right. Over the previous 15 years, an enormous transformation had taken place: with the rise of discount brokers, the elimination of fixed commissions, the introduction of individual retirement accounts and a hundred other things, the stock market had become democratized. There had been bull markets before, but this was the first in which a broad swatch of the great middle class had its savings in the stock market. We had become investors, by George, and we were all going to get rich. 
 Or were we? 
 There was an overwhelming sense of foreboding that Monday morning. After a summer of tremendous gains, the Dow Jones industrial average had dropped 11 percent the week before -- its worst week since World War II. All weekend long, the Fidelity call centers had been flooded with calls from panicky investors. 
 When the bell finally rang on Monday, it was worse that anyone could have imagined. The market started spiraling downward and never really stopped; by the time it closed, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index had lost 23 percent, making it the single worst day in the history of the American stock market. It was like ''watching a Fellini movie, except that I was in it,'' the investment adviser John Spooner would later write in The Boston Globe. I spent most of the day at a Fidelity retail office, where so many investors had crowded outside to watch the electronic tape that traffic was blocked. We didn't talk to each other; we just stared at the window. I remember feeling paralyzed.
 Jason Zweig has his own memories of Black Monday. A few months earlier, he had gotten a job at Forbes -- ''as a cub reporter'' -- and he recalled the entire staff staring at the one television screen in the office, in a state of utter shock. But he also remembers something else: ''I kept asking myself, 'How did this happen? What could drive this?' It wasn't a question anybody had a good answer to.'' In the subsequent 20 years, at Forbes and then at Money magazine, Mr. Zweig has tried to find an answer to that question. In his new book, ''Your Money & Your Brain'' (Simon & Schuster), he's as close as anybody's likely to come.
 ''There is a story in the book about Harry Markowitz,'' Mr. Zweig said the other day. He was referring to Harry M. Markowitz, the renowned economist who shared a Nobel for helping found modern portfolio theory -- and proving the importance of diversification. It's a story that says everything about how most of us act when it comes to investing. Mr. Markowitz was then working at the RAND Corporation and trying to figure out how to allocate his retirement account. He knew what he should do: ''I should have computed the historical co-variances of the asset classes and drawn an efficient frontier.'' (That's efficient-market talk for draining as much risk as possible out of his portfolio.)
 But, he said, ''I visualized my grief if the stock market went way up and I wasn't in it -- or if it went way down and I was completely in it. So I split my contributions 50/50 between stocks and bonds.'' As Mr. Zweig notes dryly, Mr. Markowitz had proved ''incapable of applying'' his breakthrough theory to his own money. Economists in his day believed powerfully in the concept of ''economic man''-- the theory that people always acted in their own best self-interest. Yet Mr. Markowitz, famous economist though he was, was clearly not an example of economic man.
 Neither are the rest of us. That's the thing about investing: we may not have invented portfolio theory like Mr. Markowitz, but most of us have some smarts, and we know, absolutely, what we are supposed to do with our money. We're supposed to diversify, shut out all the white noise of the market, rely mainly on low-expense index funds, sell when stocks are high and buy when they are going down. We should avoid the herd instead of becoming part of the herd. That what economic man would do.
 But do we do that? Hardly. When it comes to investing, most of us simply don't act rationally. Small investors spend hours on chat boards, where the herd mentality is fiercest. They can't bring themselves to sell losing positions, even when the stock is still going down. They bet everything on one or two high-risk stocks. I do not exempt myself from this behavior: a decade after the Crash of '87, I was loading up on tech stocks during the Internet bubble, even as I was writing article after article about how the bubble couldn't possibly last. 
 Having watched the way investors have behaved since the Crash of '87, I've come to believe that most human beings are simply not hard-wired to be good investors. In the 1990s, a new kind of economics arose, called behavioral economics, which tried to show that investors weren't so rational after all. So I can't deny that one of the reasons I like Mr. Zweig's book so much is he provides, at last, a scientific basis for this theory. It turns out that there is a new discipline called neuroeconomics, which combines biology, psychology and economics and tries to understand why we make the often foolish financial decisions we make. 
 The central finding, as Mr. Zweig put it, is that ''the brain is not an optimal tool for making financial decisions.'' The part of our brain that tells us to act like rational investors tends to be completely overtaken by much more powerful emotional impulses -- impulses, Mr. Zweig writes, ''that make us human.''
 He's got a million examples. ''Humans,'' he writes, ''have a phenomenal ability to detect and interpret simple patterns. That's what helped our ancestors survive the hazardous primeval world, enabling them to evade predators, find food and shelter and eventually to plant crops in the right place at the right time of year.'' But, he adds, ''when it comes to investing, our incorrigible search for patterns leads us to assume that order exists where it often doesn't.'' 
 The bogus science of technical analysis comes out of this deep human trait -- investors search for trends that are consistent and repeatable (even though they're not). So does our need to try to predict where the market is going -- something no one can possibly know. ''As soon as a stock seems to conform to a pattern that has made money before, an 'I got it' effect kicks in, making investors feel sure they know what's coming next,'' Mr. Zweig writes. But of course they don't.
 Virtually every mistake investors make has to do, in one way or another, with the way our brain has evolved. Putting far too much of our retirement portfolio in the stock of the company we work for? Neuroeconomic experiments have shown that when people put money in foreign markets, the amygdala -- ''one of the brain's fear centers'' -- kicks in. On the other hand, investing close to home -- or, better yet, in the company you are most familiar with, your own -- ''generates an automatic feeling of comfort.''
 How about understanding what our real tolerance for risk is? Mr. Zweig makes the usually overlooked point that our risk tolerance is not a fixed thing, but changes from day to day, even hour to hour, depending on our mood. Indeed, research has shown that the way we think about risk often depends on how others have framed the question for us. Amazingly, for instance, people tend to be more sanguine about risk when it is expressed as a percentage (10 percent, say) than when it is expressed as a frequency (one out of 10). 
 Despite everything, Mr. Zweig remains an investing optimist. He still thinks that people can learn to resist their emotions, buy those low-cost index funds, step away from the herd and all the rest of it. He gives plenty of advice along those lines. It's not novel advice -- David F. Swensen, the great investor who manages the Yale University endowment, gave pretty much the same advice in the book he wrote last year, ''Unconventional Success.'' But it's right.
 I came away from Mr. Zweig's book feeling just the opposite, though: that there is really not much hope that we're ever going to get the hang of investing. Humans are emotional beings, and that is always going to get in the way. What sets apart investing geniuses like Warren Buffett is precisely their ability to ignore their emotions --or, perhaps, to use them differently than the rest of us do. 
 ''I don't think they ignore their emotions,'' Mr. Zweig said. ''I think they turn them inside out. When they feel fear, they don't act on it. They examine it. They say, what should this feeling tell me? It should tell me that prices have gone down so values have gone up.'' So they buy stocks while the rest of us are selling.
 Then again, maybe there's a much simpler explanation. As our interview was winding down, Mr. Zweig told me a story -- ''I think it might even be true'' -- about Charles T. Munger, the Los Angeles lawyer best known as Mr. Buffett's sidekick at Berkshire Hathaway. ''A woman was sitting next to him at a dinner party in L.A.,'' Mr. Zweig said. ''She turned to him and said, 'You're Warren Buffett's partner, and a great investor. Tell me, what is your secret?'''
 Mr. Munger looked up at her. ''I'm rational,'' he said. Then he went back to his dinner.

HEADLINE: See No Evil, Speak No Truth

 BODY:
After decades of brutal military rule, Myanmar's people have taken to the streets to demand democracy, and they are being mowed down. China, India and Russia have the means -- but apparently not the will -- to stop Myanmar's vicious junta from murdering more of its citizens. The three countries regularly proclaim themselves world powers, yet they refuse to accept the moral responsibility that must come with that position. 
 China is Myanmar's chief trading partner and protector. Many other countries, including the United States, refuse to do business with the regime, but India and Russia are comfortably making money off the generals and helping keep them in power, with arms and energy deals. So far, they all have refused to use that leverage -- a shocking demonstration of greed and political cowardice. 
 On Wednesday, Beijing ruled out calls for international sanctions and stopped the Security Council even from condemning the junta's indiscriminate use of force against pro-democracy protests. On Friday, Russian President Vladimir Putin dismissed sanctions as premature and said he ''assumed'' the violence will stop.
 China is an authoritarian state, and Russia is increasingly anti-democratic. Officials in both fear internal dissent and fear setting a precedent that would allow others to criticize their own repressive ways. As in the case of North Korea -- another client state -- Beijing disingenuously argues its influence with Myanmar only goes so far. And despite that claim, Beijing managed to persuade the junta to allow a visit by a special United Nations envoy. 
 The response of India, the democracy on which the United States hopes to build a key security and economic relationship for the 21st century, also has been weak and pathetic. New Delhi issued a carefully nuanced call for political reform and said nothing about sanctions.
 We are heartened that the normally supercautious Association of Southeast Asian Nations, whose members are Myanmar's immediate neighbors, expressed revulsion with the junta's crackdown. But we fear that so long as the three major regional partners refuse to get tough with the generals, such outrage will make little difference. 
 China will host the 2008 Olympics, which it sees as a coming out party for its rising international power. Beijing's rulers need to know that the world is watching to see whether it will now use its influence to stop the killing in Myanmar -- or again abdicate the responsibilities that come with real world leadership.

HEADLINE: The Monks Are Cut Off, And Burmese Clashes Ebb

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Sept. 28 

 BODY:
Myanmar's armed forces appeared on Friday to have sealed tens of thousands of protesting monks inside their monasteries, but they continued to attack bands of demonstrators who challenged them in the main city, Yangon. 
 Witnesses and diplomats reached by telephone inside the country said troops were confronting and attacking smaller groups of civilians around Yangon, chasing them through narrow streets and sometimes firing at protesters and arresting them. 
 ''Today has been quieter than previous days, meaning far fewer protesters came out, but the military is being very quick to use violence, tear gas, guns and clubs to break it up,'' said Shari Villarosa, the chief diplomat at the United States Embassy. 
 Diplomats said that there was no way to know the toll of dead and wounded in Yangon or other cities, but that it was certainly far higher than the junta says.
 Bob Davis, Australia's ambassador to Myanmar, said that based on unconfirmed reports, he was sure the death toll was ''several multiples of the 10 acknowledged by the authorities.''
 ''I am afraid we believe the loss of life is far greater than is being reported,'' Prime Minister Gordon Brown of Britain said. 
 Human rights and exile groups with contacts in Myanmar said they had fewer clashes to report on Friday, at least partly because of an apparent government clampdown on Internet and telephone communications. 
 Brutal attacks on monasteries and a heavy military presence outside their gates appeared to have choked off, at least for now, the huge demonstrations led by monks that are the most serious challenge to the military junta since it took power in 1988.
 Exile groups passed on many vivid reports about brutality toward monks, many of whom were reportedly driven away in trucks. Soldiers were said to have prevented others from leaving the monasteries.
 ''Wednesday night, numerous monasteries were raided,'' Ms. Villarosa said, ''and we have reports that many monks were beaten and arrested, and we have pictures where whole monasteries have been trashed,'' including images of blood and broken glass. 
 With the monks contained, another Western diplomat said, the demonstrations seemed to have lost their focus, and soldiers were quick to pounce on any group that appeared on the streets. 
 ''Troops are chasing protesters and beating them and taking them away in trucks,'' said the diplomat, speaking anonymously under embassy policy. ''There are pockets of protesters left. They are unorganized, and it's all very small-scale.'' 
 Even if the junta clears the streets, it seems to have turned most of the world against it. The crackdown has drawn far more intense criticism than in 1988, when the military responded to protests by killing thousands.
 Nor was it clear how the junta would recover any legitimacy at home. ''The military is doing their best to frighten people into going back, but they are not doing anything about the underlying grievances,'' Ms. Villarosa said. ''Whether they will ultimately be successful, I doubt, because the grievances are real.'' 
 Heavy pressure from the United Nations has forced the military to allow a visit from a special United Nations envoy, Ibrahim Gambari. He is expected to reach Myanmar on Saturday. 
 In Washington, President Bush thanked China, Myanmar's leading trade partner, for helping persuade the junta to allow the visit. 
 In Tokyo, Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda said that he had spoken with his Chinese counterpart, Wen Jiabao, and that they had agreed to work on international efforts to solve the crisis. 
 ''I asked that China, given its close ties with Myanmar, exercise its influence, and Prime Minister Wen said he would make such efforts,'' Mr. Fukuda said. 
 Reuters reported that Japan would send an envoy to Myanmar to investigate the death of a videojournalist, Kenji Nagai. A videotape shows that Mr. Nagai, who was killed Thursday while filming protests near the Sule Pagoda in Yangon, may have been shot at close range.
 The current crisis began on Aug. 19, after the government increased fuel prices overnight by as much as 500 percent without any announcement or explanation. The increases ignited scattered protests led at first by longtime dissidents, most of whom had been involved in the protests of 1988. The demonstrations revealed the deep discontent and anger over the junta's economic mismanagement.
 In 45 years of military rule -- and 19 years under this junta -- Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, has become a ragged, suffering nation, one of the poorest and most repressed in Asia. 
 The crowds grew much larger after Sept. 18, when huge columns of monks filled the streets and residents joined them by the tens of thousands. The demonstrations swelled to as many as 100,000 monks and supporters in Yangon alone. 
 Defying international warnings and condemnation, the government crackdown began Wednesday morning with raids on several monasteries and the appearance of an aggressive armed force on the streets.

HEADLINE: Flying Made a Bit Less Painful

BYLINE: By PAUL B. BROWN

 BODY:
RECORD cancellations, endless delays and interminable security lines have eliminated whatever fun was once associated with flying. But there are ways to make travel a little less costly and a bit more convenient, according to Conde Nast Traveller.
 If you are planning to travel out of the country, for example, check if the flight is a code share.
 ''When a U.S. airline and its foreign partner both sell seats on the same flight (making it a code share), one carrier's fares could be substantially lower, so check prices on both,'' Wendy Perrin writes. The same seat on the same New York to Hong Kong flight could cost hundreds less on Cathay Pacific than on American Airlines, or vice versa. 
 Paying for wireless access at the airport is annoying. One way to get around it is to ''sit right outside an airport club lounge: Wi-Fi signals often glide through the wall,'' Ms. Perrin writes.
 If your plane is going to be delayed for a while, going to the lounge may be a good idea. Some airline clubs allow you to join just for the day, at a fee of $25 to $45, she adds. 
 Finally, if your travel encompasses a long weekend ''you'll find cheaper fares and greater seat availability if you fly on a Saturday and return on a Tuesday, instead of going from Thursday to Sunday or Friday to Monday.''
 BAGGAGE CLAIM Tim Cigelske, who identifies himself as a baggage handler for a major airline in Milwaukee from 2005 to 2007, confirms your worst fears about what happens to your luggage once you check it, in Budget Travel. 
 Mr. Cigelske confesses that he once put a cart of bags on the wrong plane by accident. He says that a bag that has not been checked in at least 30 minutes before the flight ''will probably miss the plane.'' And, he says, since ''baggage handlers can cram a Boeing 737 with 150 bags in under 30 minutes,'' pristine bags don't stay that way for long. 
 His advice is to buy luggage that is durable but ''not fancy,'' and if you check in at the last minute, beg a sympathetic ticket agent for help. 
 TRUE FIRST CLASS Yes, airplane travel can be awful these days, but the good news, according to Jonathan Reynolds writing in Men's Vogue, is that many foreign carriers have rethought comfort, service and food. 
 For example on the Lufthansa flight from Frankfurt to New York (one-way fare: $5,679) there is a choice of Piper-Heidsieck Cuvee Rare or Taittinger Champagne to wash down the Calvisius caviar.
 And those traveling on Emirates from Dubai to Hamburg, Germany, (one-way fare: $2,848) can choose from ''an epic wine list featuring Chateau Palmer'' to accompany their assorted Arabic meze plate. 
 TRANSYLVANIA 6500 Looking for someplace to go? Why not head to the Transylvania region of Romania to consider whether to buy Dracula's Castle?
 ''Built in 1212 as a stronghold by the Teutonic Knights, Bran Castle was also a defense point against the Turks, a customs post between Transylvania and neighboring Wallachia, and later a residence for the royal family,'' The Robb Report Collection writes. ''As legend has it, Vlad the Impaler spent one night there. The castle, the inspiration behind Bram Stoker's 'Dracula,' still attracts thousands of visits each year.''
 The castle and the ancillary buildings are spread over 22 acres. The magazine expects the property to be sold for $135 million.
 FINAL TAKE ''Unemployment hurts both your bank account and your immune system,'' Men's Health writes, citing a study in Psychosomatic Medicine. ''Blood samples from 100 unemployed people showed that their immune systems were 20 percent weaker than those earning a paycheck.'' Three months after getting a job, their systems rebounded. PAUL B. BROWN

HEADLINE: A Rights Advocate Whose Work Divides Dominicans

BYLINE: By MARC LACEY

 BODY:
SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic
 WHEN Sonia Pierre won an international human rights award last fall, there were two diametrically opposite reactions here: ''Way to go!'' and ''Oh, no!''
 Ms. Pierre is the Dominican Republic's most polarizing human rights advocate, a dark-skinned woman who says she can only dream of a country in which her color -- and the skin tone of hundreds of thousands of other Dominicans like her who are of Haitian descent -- is a non-issue. 
 Carlos Morales Troncoso, the Dominican foreign minister, was among those who were infuriated at the honor Ms. Pierre received from the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Center for Human Rights. He fired off a letter to Mr. Kennedy's widow, Ethel, labeling the award ''ill advised'' and ''myopic.'' 
 ''I fear that, unfortunately, the Robert F. Kennedy Prize is divorced from reality on the island of Hispaniola, and unfortunately there was bad information on the consequences of the work of Ms. Pierre in these parts,'' wrote Mr. Morales, who blames her for smearing the reputation of the country internationally and creating, rather than healing, racial divisions. 
 The letter was the least of Ms. Pierre's problems. Within months, the Dominican government began questioning her citizenship and suggested that she belonged on the other half of Hispaniola, the island that the Dominican Republic shares with Haiti.
 Born in the Dominican Republic to Haitian parents, Ms. Pierre, 44, has spent her life advocating on behalf of Haitians and ethnic Haitians who hold Dominican citizenship but are subjected to racial discrimination in a society that places a high value on lighter skin. At the age of 13, she organized a protest by sugar-cane workers in one of the Dominican slums -- known as bateyes -- where she grew up seeing Haitian workers oppressed by their Dominican bosses. 
 Her current troubles with the government stem from 2005, when her organization, Movement for Dominico-Haitian Women, took to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights the case of two ethnic Haitian children who were denied Dominican birth certificates. The court found in their favor, ordering the government to provide the birth certificates and pay $8,000 in damages to each of the children. 
 The court could hardly have found otherwise. The Dominican Constitution grants citizenship to those born on Dominican soil, except the children of diplomats or those ''in transit'' through the country. That has long meant that the children of Haitians who came to the country to work, legally or illegally, gained Dominican citizenship.
 But after the decision, the Dominican Supreme Court ruled that Haitian workers were considered ''in transit,'' and that their children were therefore not entitled to citizenship. (Those children are entitled to Haitian citizenship, however, because Haiti grants citizenship to the offspring of Haitians no matter where they are born.)
 THE decision has been decried by human rights groups, who say it has prompted government officials to begin questioning the citizenship of many Dominicans of Haitian descent, putting them at risk of deportation. But Dominican officials respond that there is only one person to blame for the crackdown: Ms. Pierre. 
 She scoffs at that notion, saying that the problem is racism, not her efforts to end it. 
 Race is a complicated issue in the Dominican Republic, where much of the population traces its ancestry to the African slaves brought to the island, but where few regard themselves as black. Ms. Pierre said it was considered a compliment for a light-skinned Dominican to tell a dark-skinned one that he had the soul of a white person. Saying that someone thinks like a black person, Ms. Pierre says, is the equivalent of labeling the person ignorant.
 ''On TV, the maids are always black and the models are always white,'' she said.
 The American Embassy recently urged its staff members not to patronize one of Santo Domingo's most popular nightclubs, Loft, because African-American diplomats were denied admission at the door while whites got past the bouncer. Ms. Pierre said she was not surprised.
 ''I'm sure they were confused with being Haitian,'' said Ms. Pierre, who speaks Spanish as well as Haitian creole and is a flurry of activity in her office, sometimes pressing two phones to her ears at once.
 ''Haitianization'' is what Dominicans call the negative influences that poor Haitians bring to their side of the island. Mr. Morales, the foreign minister, explained in his letter protesting Ms. Pierre's award that his country could not handle the huge numbers of illegal Haitian immigrants. He put the blame on the United States and other countries for failing to improve conditions in Haiti.
 Mr. Morales did not mention that as Haitians head to the more prosperous economy of the Dominican Republic, many Dominicans emigrate to better opportunities in the United States -- sometimes legally, sometimes not.
 Even as Haitians are shunned, Ms. Pierre argues that the Dominican economy relies on them. Haitian laborers can be seen on construction sites throughout the capital, including the new subway that is the personal project of President Leonel Fernandez.
 Ms. Pierre's office, just down the road from the presidential palace, has become a gathering spot for Dominicans of Haitian descent who find their nationality questioned.
 ON a recent day, there was a mother who had tried to get a government identity card for her 19-year-old daughter but was told that her daughter, who was born in the Dominican Republic, was a foreigner. The girl's plans for college depended on her getting the card.
 A father, an English teacher at a Dominican public school, came to Ms. Pierre's office after trying for five months to get a birth certificate for his newborn daughter. ''I'm as Dominican as they are,'' he said, adding angrily that the government had begun issuing pink birth certificates for children it suspected of being foreigners as opposed to the white documents given to Dominican children.
 In Ms. Pierre's case, officials questioning her nationality have focused on disparities in her record. Her name is listed on her birth certificate as Solain Pie, which she says is a result of a government clerk's error. She said her first name should be Solange (Sonia is a nickname), whereas Pierre is her last name.
 Both her parents, she said, were Haitians who came to the Dominican Republic for work. Her mother had two children in Haiti, both of whom remain there, and 12 more in the Dominican Republic.
 ''I'm not Haitian, no matter what the government says,'' Ms. Pierre said. ''My parents were, but I'm not. I'm Dominican, and I have the same right of any citizen to criticize my country.''

HEADLINE: Elegy for a Novel Music Store

BYLINE: By DAN MITCHELL

 BODY:
AS Amazon.com introduced a digital music store this week, another music download service and would-be iTunes-killer, AnywhereCD, was quietly dying.
 The company's founder, Michael Robertson, offered an unusually frank epitaph on his blog (michaelrobertson.com). ''It's a real shame,'' he wrote, ''because I think it was a solid business idea.'' AnywhereCD was an effort to please both consumers and the record labels. It offered a physical CD along with downloads of the CD for one price. ''Sounds great in theory,'' Mr. Robertson said, ''but I wasn't able to pull it off.''
 The failure was due largely to the reluctance of major music labels, he said. While several seemed ''open minded,'' others made demands that, he said, seemed ridiculous. ''One insanely asked me if I would embed the purchaser's credit card number in the song files they bought,'' he wrote. In the end, just one major label, Warner Music, signed on to the service. 
 Om Malik of GigaOM referred to Mr. Robertson as a ''constant entrepreneur.'' Among his many start-ups are MP3.com, which CNET owns now. 
 Mr. Malik's assessment of the demise of AnywhereCD was this: ''Blame it on lack of a big library, or consumer apathy to full albums or just simple Apple domination, the party didn't even get started for this company'' (gigaom.com).
 As for the Amazon store, Amazon MP3, ''Apple has its first legitimate challenger since the iTunes Store first launched,'' wrote Pete Mortensen on the Cult of Mac blog (cultofmac.com). That, he wrote, is largely because Amazon is selling music free of copyright restrictions, meaning that tracks can be played on just about any portable music player. ''It's as flexible and free as the CDs that I bought at the store on Saturday,'' he wrote. ''And that's better than iTunes.''
 LEGAL TENDER TRAP One day in May, Shaun Kranish, 22, of Rockford, Ill., and his fiancee then (now wife) Svetlana Dudnik, 24, finished their meal at the Dari Ripple in Walworth, Wis., and tried to pay their bill using Liberty Dollars -- silver coins minted by a private company. Minutes later, the Walworth County police showed up, and the couple were arrested on charges including misdemeanor theft. 
 The Kranishes this month started a blog at libertydollararrest.blogspot.com. The couple insist that they were simply offering to ''barter'' for their meal, and would have been glad to pay their bill in United States currency, but were never given the chance.
 The Gazette, a newspaper in nearby Janesville, reported last week that the legality of Liberty Dollars is in dispute. The United States Mint and the Justice Department say using them as currency is illegal. The man who makes them, Bernard von NotHaus, encourages their use for ''barter,'' but warns customers that they are not legal tender. Mr. von NotHaus, who describes himself on his Web site (libertydollar.org) as a ''monetary architect,'' is suing the government for hurting his business by warning people not to use the coins.
 FACEBOOK'S WORTH A potential deal between Microsoft and Facebook, reported this week, would value the social network at $10 billion. Julie Sloane of Wired News (blog.wired.com/business) wondered what else is worth that much. These are among her findings: that amount equals the gross domestic product of Bolivia; it's the cost of about 469 tons of gold; and it would buy 25 million iPhones. DAN MITCHELL

HEADLINE: Stocks Back Near Highs Hit in July

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
After a tumultuous and brutal August, the stock market has regained its footing and is within striking distance of the record highs it set in July.
 The surge began building before the Federal Reserve cut interest rates last week and has come at a time when news from the housing market remains bleak.
 Conditions in the debt markets have eased somewhat, but specialists say they remain much tighter than they were earlier this year. 
 Since Aug. 15, when the stock market hit its lowest point in five months, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is up 8.5 percent and the Dow Jones industrial average 8 percent. The increase has erased much of the decline from late July and early August and left the indexes up modestly for the third quarter, which ended yesterday.
 ''It's kind of amazing how well equities have held up,'' said Douglas M. Peta, chief market strategist at J. W. Seligman & Company, an investment firm in New York. 
 ''If you went away sometime in July and came back about now, you might say, 'Nothing happened while I was gone,''' he said.
 In yesterday's trading, the main indexes fell slightly, with the S.& P. 500 down 4.63 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,526.75. The Dow slipped 17.31 points, or 0.12 percent, to 13,895.63, and the Nasdaq fell 8.09 points, or 0.30 percent, to 2,701.50.
 That still left the Dow and the Nasdaq with gains of more than 11 percent this year, and the S.&P. up 7.7 percent for the year. 
 The market appears to be buoyed by a belief that the problems in the housing and credit markets will not pull the broader economy into a recession and that growth in Asia and Europe will help offset those ill effects. The optimism is most vividly manifest in the performance of foreign markets, particularly in the fast-developing countries like China and India.
 A widely followed Morgan Stanley index that tracks emerging markets is up 26 percent since Aug. 16, when it hit a low. Markets in developed countries excluding the United States are up nearly 12 percent in the same period.
 Even in the United States, the market's return has been led by sectors like energy, industrials, materials and technology, which investors believe are best positioned to take advantage of the growth abroad.
 The financial and consumer discretionary sectors have lagged; they are seen as having the most to lose from a declining housing market and slowing consumer spending domestically.
 Indeed, investors in September poured $1.1 billion into mutual funds that specialize in emerging markets, while they withdrew about $3.2 billion from domestic equity funds, according to AMG Data Services, a research firm.
 Expectations that the rest of the world will outperform the United States are also reflected in the depreciating dollar, which dropped yesterday to $1.4265 against the euro, a new low. The dollar has fallen 2.8 percent against the euro since Sept. 14, when the Fed cut rates and is down 8 percent for the year. Gold prices rose 1.4 percent, to $742.80 a troy ounce, the highest since 1980. 
 Currency traders, and others in the financial markets, are operating under the assumption that central bankers in Washington have taken a more activist and accommodating stance.
 That view started to take hold in mid-August when the Fed cut the discount rate -- what it charges banks to borrow directly from it. Investors became even more convinced last week when the Fed cut its benchmark rate by half a point, to 4.75 percent, rather than the expected quarter point.
 The futures market is now predicting that the Fed will cut rates at least once more, to 4.5 percent, at its meeting on Oct. 30 and 31.
 But one Fed official, William Poole, said yesterday that ''it would be a mistake for markets to bake into the cake the assumption of ongoing rate cuts,'' according to Bloomberg News.
 Mr. Poole, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, responding to a question after a speech in New York, said he was expressing his own views and not speaking for the Fed.
 In the credit market, the Fed's rate cutting and its lending at the discount rate and through open market operations have eased the logjam somewhat.
 This week, banks raising money for the private equity buyout of the First Data Corporation, a credit card processor, were able to sell more debt than they had planned. 
 Still some of the roughly $300 billion debt backlog that needs to be sold may never be worked off. The private equity acquisitions that are falling apart or being withdrawn include the purchases of the student loan provider Sallie Mae and Harman International Industries, a maker of high-end audio speakers.
 ''You still have a big overhang of supply out there,'' said Eric G. Takaha, director of corporate and high-yield debt at Franklin Templeton, the investment company. ''But the path has become a little clearer.''
 One mortgage company, Thornburg Mortgage, said the market for ''jumbo'' home loans -- those with a face value of more than $417,000 -- appeared to be improving. In recent weeks, investors have been more willing to buy bonds backed by pools of the mortgages, but are demanding higher returns and more safeguards against default. 
 Home buyers searching for jumbo loans will notice a slight drop in interest rates but will have to shop around, said Larry A. Goldstone, president and chief operating officer at Thornburg, based in Santa Fe, N.M.
 ''The market has improved modestly and it is certainly not deteriorating,'' Mr. Goldstone said. ''I think it has a ways to go before it's back to functioning in a completely normal way.''

HEADLINE: Where Everybody Knows Your Team

BYLINE: By HOLLY BRUBACH. 
Holly Brubach is a frequent contributor to The New York Times Magazine.

 BODY:
Pittsburgh
 GREETINGS from the Motherland, far-flung Steeler fans! And to those football lovers living in exile from their team's hometown, consider my experience ...
 Last season was nearly over when I moved back to Pittsburgh, where I grew up. As any native can tell you, we take our football seriously. Visitors are put on notice at the airport, where they're greeted at the top of the escalators leading to baggage claim by life-size figures of those two great Americans: George Washington and Franco Harris. 
 When I was a girl, my dad, a former high-school halfback, watched Steeler games from an easy chair opposite the television in the family room, where I divided my attention between my homework and the action on the field. The quarterback dropped back. My dad's feet began to move. Then the handoff. The defense swarmed the ball carrier. My dad juked in his chair. All this took place in silence, punctuated by the occasional clap or groan. That was the extent of our collective viewing experience. 
 Once in a blue moon we went to the now-defunct Three Rivers Stadium. Those were the options: football live, a public event attended by a screaming horde or football televised, a private experience. And that, perhaps, is the way it would have stayed, had I never left, and had sports bars never come along. 
 The first one I knew of opened around the corner from my apartment on the Upper West Side sometime in the early '80s, back in the days of primordial cable, before ESPN controlled the sporting universe. On Sunday nights the frat-house atmosphere overflowed, as rowdy guys riding a Budweiser tide spilled into the street. A woman was rare, always towed by a boyfriend. 
 Football seasons came and went. I moved to Paris; I moved back. I missed my team. The only time they ever appeared in my living room was when they went up against a New York team. Finally, one afternoon I braved the sports bar scene, which by then seemed more hospitable. Giants and Jets fans made up close to half the crowd, and the other half looked like spectators at the Pro Bowl, with jerseys from every team in the league. I had a great time.
 Then I moved downtown and decided to try the sports bar around the corner. Like so many other unofficial Manhattan landmarks, Buster's Garage has since been razed to make way for condominiums, but in the runup to Pittsburgh's Super Bowl XL victory, it served as game-time headquarters for New York City Steeler fans who turned out in astonishing numbers, waving their Terrible Towels. 
 Back in the '70s, Bob Ryan, an editor for NFL Films, christened the Cowboys ''America's team,'' because their following extended far beyond Dallas. Today, however, Steeler Nation seems to outnumber the fans of every other franchise, Dallas included, thanks in large part to the great Pittsburgh diaspora: with the economic devastation that followed the closing of the mills, the population dwindled to less than half what it was in 1950. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette's Web site lists Steeler bars in all 50 states, more than 20 foreign countries and, in recent seasons, at a research outpost on Antarctica. Steeler fans are literally everywhere.
 As I can attest. A few years ago, finding myself in Rochester, Minn., one evening when ''Monday Night Football'' was broadcasting a Steeler game, I set out for the local sports bar recommended by the hotel desk clerk. A taxi took me to the outskirts of town where we pulled into a strip mall and -- this was December and the temperature was six below zero -- I disembarked to find 10 people in black-and-gold jerseys tailgating in the parking lot. 
 One of the regulars from Buster's called last week to ask if I'd been to Heinz Field yet. Once, I told him, courtesy of a friend with a spare ticket at the last minute. Yep, that was a thrill all right. And get this: Franco Harris sitting eight rows behind us. (Behind us?) But it isn't as if that'll be happening often, I said, since every game here is sold out. I need to come up with a new viewing plan. ''Don't tell me you can't find a Steeler bar in Pittsburgh,'' he laughed. The problem, I explained, is that every bar in Pittsburgh is a Steeler bar. 
 As I write this, I'm in my new apartment, watching the Steelers play the Bills on TV. It sure is quiet here. Nobody talks back to the announcers. I miss the guy in the Joe Greene jersey who would throw his hat in disgust whenever he disagreed with the ref's call and then crawl ignominiously across the room to retrieve it. I miss the chanting -- ''Here we go, Steel-ers! Here we go!'' Clap. Clap. -- which you can't really do alone without feeling completely ridiculous. And, hey, while we're at it: I miss the waitress who brought me a burger and a beer. 
 It occurs to me now that the experience of hunkering down with fellow Steeler fans in Manhattan or Rochester or Toronto or San Francisco is a lot like celebrating Thanksgiving and the Fourth of July with other American expatriates during the years when I lived abroad. They were, for the most part, people I never would have met back home. We shared few, if any, interests; we worked in fields that were unrelated. The bonds we formed were based on solidarity -- not a flag-waving patriotism but an awareness of our similarities, inherent and deep, which in the moment outweighed our differences. Those were among the best holidays I ever spent, still vivid in memory.
 It's not that you can't go home again, but that once you get there, chances are you'll wish you were somewhere else when football season rolls around. Maybe it takes someone whose sense of home has been intensified by distance to understand the logic in leaving Pittsburgh to watch a Steeler game. I've already booked my flights.

HEADLINE: 3Com Agrees to a Private Buyout for $2.2 Billion

BYLINE: By LAURIE J. FLYNN and KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
3Com, an unprofitable computer networking company, said yesterday that it had agreed to be acquired by Bain Capital Partners for $2.2 billion in cash in an arrangement that also gives a Chinese company, Huawei Technologies, a minority stake in the company.
 The deal means the end of an era for a storied Silicon Valley company that has stumbled in recent years in the face of more nimble competitors like Cisco and Nortel. 
 It also provides yet another test case for Washington lawmakers wary of high-technology deals with Chinese companies that they think could compromise American security.
 Edgar Masri, 3Com's president and chief executive, said the buyout would help make 3Com more competitive. ''Going private will give us more flexibility,'' he said. ''We will be able to focus on our long-term strategic objectives.'' 
 Mark Sue, an analyst with RBC Capital, said 3Com had ''struggled with execution and inconsistency'' for so long that he doubted going private would solve its problems. ''Battling a strong Cisco in the enterprise may prove increasingly difficult,'' Mr. Sue said in a research note yesterday. He said Huawei appeared to have the most to gain from the deal.
 Under the terms of the deal, 3Com shareholders will receive $5.30 in cash for each share of 3Com stock, a premium of about 44 percent over 3Com's $3.68 closing price on Thursday. 3Com shares rallied $1.26 a share, or 34 percent, to close at $4.94. The deal, if approved, is expected to close in the first quarter of next year. 
 3Com executives said the size of Huawei's stake in the company would be disclosed in a few weeks. 
 Late last year, 3Com spent $822 million to buy Huawei's share of a joint venture between the companies. 3Com and Huawei had formed the venture, known as H3C, in 2003 to broaden 3Com's reach in Asian markets while giving Huawei access to American customers. 
 Mr. Masri said the company had considered competing offers from several other companies, but selected Bain in part because of its experience in Asia. 3Com employs 6,000 people, most of them in Asia.
 3Com, which in recent years has had its headquarters in Marlborough, Mass., was one of the fastest-growing Silicon Valley companies in the late 1980s as computer networking caught on among corporations. 
 The company grew rapidly through the late 1990s, and at the height of the Internet boom in 2000, 3Com's stock price rose briefly above $100 a share, only to plummet in the dot-com bust and as a result of management gaffes. 
 Among those problems was the 1997 acquisition of the modem maker U.S. Robotics and its Palm Computing operation, maker of a line of hand-held electronic organizers. 3Com's Palm business was seen on Wall Street as a distraction from 3Com's core businesses, and in 2000, 3Com spun off Palm as separate public company that now makes the Treo line of smartphones. 
 Since then, 3Com has continued to fall further behind its rival Cisco, which has aggressively acquired technology it needed to keep ahead of other competitors. 3Com, with revenue last year of $1.3 billion, has not posted a profit for six years. 
 The proposed sale is almost certain to attract close scrutiny in Washington, where Huawei has long attracted suspicions over supposed links to China's military and intelligence agencies. The company's reclusive founder and president, Ren Zhengfei, is a former Chinese army engineer.
 Michael R. Wessel, a commissioner of the United States-China Economic and Security Review Commission, which was created by Congress to monitor bilateral relations, said that the federal government's Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States ''should take a hard look at this transaction'' before allowing Huawei to buy part of 3Com.
 Mr. Wessel, who also criticized the Chinese company Lenovo's acquisition of I.B.M.'s personal computer business three years ago, pointed to reports this month that Chinese hackers had tried to penetrate military computer systems at the Pentagon and in Britain. He said that Huawei's control of an important network security provider like 3Com would raise national security issues.
 If the 3Com deal becomes controversial, as did a bid by Cnooc Ltd. of China for Unocal two years ago or DP World's effort last year to acquire control of American port facilities, then the transaction may also draw attention to Bain Capital in the race for the Republican presidential nomination.
 Mitt Romney, a candidate for the nomination, was the chief executive of Bain Capital for 15 years before his successful run in 2002 to become governor of Massachusetts. His financial disclosure form last month showed that he and his immediate family earned more than $8 million last year from Bain Capital, with stakes in more than 30 Bain Capital funds.

HEADLINE: It's All a Grand Capitalist Conspiracy

BYLINE: By TOM REDBURN

 BODY:
THE SHOCK DOCTRINE
 The Rise of Disaster Capitalism
 By Naomi Klein
 558 pages. Metropolitan Books. $28.
 When Milton Friedman died last year, the acclaim for his work was nearly universal. Even his ideological opponents, like Paul Krugman and Lawrence Summers, treated this Nobel Prize-winning economist -- who taught for decades at the University of Chicago -- with respect.
 Naomi Klein will have none of it. In her new book, ''The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism,'' she essentially accuses Friedman of being the godfather of a Mafia-like gang, the Chicago Boys, who have exploited the public disorientation associated with catastrophes and political crises to impose an unwanted free-market ideology on much of the world. 
 Ms. Klein's touchstone is Latin America, where authoritarian governments long ruled in the interests of wealthy landowners and the elites in charge of economic cartels, but she doesn't stop there.
 Everything from the collapse of the Soviet bloc to the invasion of Iraq, from the flooding of New Orleans to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, in her view, have been opportunities for a particularly ruthless form of capitalism to succeed where it otherwise would never take hold. 
 And when free-market advocacy alone hasn't worked, military force and brutal repression are always at hand to cow the public, all in the interest of promoting the privatization of public resources, the shredding of the social safety net and opening up new markets for foreign investors. 
 There's a measure of truth about the dark side of globalization in all this, but that's a lot to lay on poor Milton.
 Ms. Klein pins the blame for much of the misery in the world squarely on what she views as Friedman's misguided philosophy and the many people in its thrall. And here she includes not only a litany of expected conservatives like Ronald Reagan, Margaret Thatcher and George W. Bush, but what others might think of as conventional liberals, people like Bill Clinton and Jeffrey D. Sachs, the Columbia University economist who advocated economic ''shock therapy'' in post-socialist countries like Bolivia and Poland and now is one of the leading proponents in the effort to increase sharply aid to the world's poor. 
 ''Since the fall of Communism, free markets and free people have been packaged as a single ideology that claims to be humanity's best and only defense against repeating a history filled with mass graves, killing fields and torture chambers,'' Ms. Klein writes. ''Yet in the Southern Cone, the first place where the contemporary religion of unfettered free markets escaped from the basement workshops of the University of Chicago and was applied in the real world, it did not bring democracy; it was predicated on the overthrow of democracy in country after country. And it did not bring peace but required the systematic murder of tens of thousands and the torture of between 100,000 and 150,000 people.'' 
 Friedman's association with Gen. Augusto Pinochet, the Chilean dictator, was indeed the worst stain on his career. His defense that his economic advice to Pinochet was no different from what a doctor might give a government on how to deal with an outbreak of AIDS is not very persuasive. 
 Moreover, it is no secret that capitalism does not require a democratic political system to thrive: China is proof of that. Ms. Klein is not alone, either, in pointing out that many governments serve to protect the interests of the rich, and that as inequality grows, the threat rises that the establishment will turn to undemocratic means to thwart the will of the majority.
 Ms. Klein exposes the hypocrisy behind those who promote free enterprise but accept autocratic regimes to carry it out, which makes her book a useful corrective to some of the uncritical celebrations of the spread of globalization since the collapse of the Soviet empire. 
 But her argument constantly overreaches, because her goal is not really to tame capitalism so much as to taunt it. 
 While Ms. Klein occasionally nods to Scandinavian-style social democracy as an alternative to the ''neo-liberal'' American-style model she condemns, it turns out that nothing short of a socialist utopia -- an economy of worker collectives running environmentally benign enterprises with nationalized banks to direct investment -- will actually do. 
 What she is most blind to is the necessary role of entrepreneurial capitalism in overcoming the inherent tendency of any established social system to lapse into stagnation, as all too many socialist countries -- and some nonsocialist ones, too -- have shown. Like it or not, without strong economic growth and its inevitable disruptions , there is little hope for creating the healthy middle classes necessary to sustain democracies, much less an improvement in the lot of the poor and dispossessed Ms. Klein seeks to represent. And yes, that means some people will become rich and powerful.
 In the end, I suspect that Ms. Klein's goal in writing ''The Shock Doctrine'' is not so much to persuade others to join her anti-globalization, anti-corporatist cause as it is to reinforce the dreams of those already convinced of its righteousness. 
 ''We did not lose the battles of ideas,'' she said in a recent speech to the American Sociological Association. ''We were not outsmarted and we were not out-argued. We lost because we were crushed. Sometimes we were crushed by army tanks, and sometimes we were crushed by think tanks. And by think tanks I mean the people who are paid to think by the makers of tanks.''
 That must be a comforting thought. If only it were that simple.

HEADLINE: U.S. Steps Up Confrontation With Myanmar's Rulers

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER and STEVEN LEE MYERS; Helene Cooper contributed reporting from New York.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 28 

 BODY:
The Bush administration stepped up its confrontation with the ruling junta in Myanmar on Friday, and officials said they were searching for ways to persuade China and other nations to cut off lending, investment and trade into the country.
 But in a sign of how limited Washington's leverage is against the country, which has long been the target of American sanctions, officials said they were concerned that China, a trading partner and neighbor of Myanmar, would block any serious effort to destabilize the Burmese government.
 The administration seems to regard the violent crackdown on Burmese monks as a long-hoped-for opportunity to get other Southeast Asian nations to rethink their insistence that they should not interfere with the internal politics of their neighbors. The hope is that American pressure might force the Burmese leaders into a political process that would drive them from power, if not from the country. 
 ''What we are trying to do is speed their demise,'' said a senior American official. ''The question is, do we have the diplomatic and economic influence to hit a bank shot here,'' by persuading Beijing, in particular, that its dealings with Myanmar could embarrass it as the 2008 Olympics approach. 
 Another senior official said the administration would try to persuade China to offer sanctuary to the leaders of the junta, in hopes it would get them out of the country. Other ideas include getting China and India to halt investment in new oil and gas projects, cutting off bank lending in places like Singapore to freeze Burmese accounts.
 The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were discussing internal policy deliberations.
 Many of the techniques are modeled on the sanctions designed against North Korea. Officials were surprised at how quickly banks ceased dealing with that country as soon as they realized it could affect their access to the American banking system.
 ''International institutions take our list seriously,'' one of the officials said, referring to banks. The official added, ''They quickly realize the downside of dealing with these people is greater than the upside.''
 At least for the moment, officials said, the junta leaders seemed to be gaining some ground over the protesters, cutting off their access to the Internet, so that photographs and video of the street confrontations would not circulate around the world.
 The government does face international criticism, though. The United Nations, under pressure from the Bush administration and European leaders, is sending a special envoy, Ibrahim Gambari, to Myanmar, which agreed to allow him to visit after China intervened, officials said.
 In a meeting on Thursday, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice confronted a midlevel Burmese diplomat, according to officials who were present, telling him it was ''bizarre'' that he was defending his government while pictures emerged of troops shooting unarmed monks.
 On Friday, Ms. Rice expressed disappointment that the United Nations Security Council could not act more forcefully, largely because of opposition from China.
 ''I will say on Burma that given what is going on in the streets in Rangoon, I would have hope that the Security Council would have taken stronger action,'' Ms. Rice said in New York, referring to the country's capital, Yangon, by its traditional name. American policy does not recognize the military government's changing of the country's name to Myanmar and continues to refer to it as Burma.
 The Bush administration's efforts have received praise from an unexpected quarter: human rights advocates.
 ''To the extent the international community is not moving, it is not the fault of the United States,'' said Jeremy Woodrum, a co-founder of the U.S. Campaign for Burma, an advocacy organization in Washington. He credited President Bush with forcing through statements critical of Myanmar's leaders this week by the United Nations Security Council and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
 Officials said Mr. Bush saw the events in Myanmar as a chance to reinforce his push for democracy around the world. ''It's a legacy moment,'' a senior American diplomat said.
 Mr. Bush discussed how to respond to the military crackdown in a video conference on Friday with Prime Minister Gordon Brown of Britain, who promised to seek tougher sanctions through the European Union. The State Department also announced that it had barred ''more than three dozen'' senior officials and their family members from entering the United States.
 On Thursday, the Treasury Department announced a list of 14 of Myanmar's leaders who now face sanctions. One of the senior officials said that the list would be expanded next week to include more officials.
 Few Burmese leaders have ever traveled to the United States, but President Bush pointedly included family members when he announced the visa bans. The State Department did not specify who was on the list, though it almost certainly includes those on the Treasury Department's list.
 The officials warned that it could easily be expanded to include Burmese officials' children or grandchildren who might be visiting or studying in the United States.
 One of the senior officials said that the administration was also considering the fate of the only major American investment in Myanmar, a Chevron energy stake, which was grandfathered in when the Clinton administration imposed sanctions on the country in 1997.
 Chevron owns a share of a gas field and pipeline project that was initially acquired by Unocal. The project also includes Total from France, PTT Exploration and Production of Thailand and Myanmar's Myanma Oil and Gas Enterprise.
 A spokesman for Chevron, Donald Campbell, declined to comment on whether the new sanctions or any other under consideration would affect the company's investment.
 Given the dearth of American investment and trade with Myanmar, the financial levers appear limited, officials acknowledged. 
 But the United States has stepped up pressure in other ways: Voice of America and Radio Free Asia doubled their broadcasting into the country in Burmese to five hours a day. 
 Officials hope to increase that, and also to shift funds to help support nongovernmental organizations and purchase cellphones to help disseminate information, especially now that the government has shut down Myanmar's Internet connections.
 Ultimately, though, the officials said the greatest hope for forcing the military government to negotiate its own demise, in effect, rested with the country's neighbors, especially China.
 President Bush used an Oval Office meeting with China's foreign minister on Thursday to press for strong action, but American officials say the Chinese are reluctant to act against a significant trading partner or set a precedent for undermining a single-party government that represses dissent.
 Still, the White House press secretary, Dana M. Perino, said Friday that Mr. Bush was pleased with the outcome of his meeting with the foreign minister, Yang Jeichi. ''I think that the Chinese were helpful in allowing to make sure the U.N. special envoy was allowed to get there, to Burma,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Split in Group Delays Vote On Sanctions Against Iran

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 28 

 BODY:
The United States, Britain and France chose unity over speed and agreed on Friday to delay until November a United Nations Security Council vote on a third sanctions resolution against Iran.
 The delay, a concession to Russia, China and Germany -- the other three countries in the fragile coalition of six world powers that are seeking to rein in Tehran's nuclear ambitions -- came after a week of haggling on the outskirts of the General Assembly. The six countries issued a statement advising Iran that a diplomatic offer of economic incentives remained on the table if Iran suspended its uranium enrichment program. 
 The statement said the six powers would complete the new resolution and bring it to a vote unless reports from the European foreign policy chief, Javier Solana, and the International Atomic Energy Agency in November ''show a positive outcome of their efforts.'' 
 Bush administration officials, who have been pushing diplomats to increase sanctions against Iran, said the move to put off a decision until November reflected the harsh realities of getting all six countries to speak with one voice. While officials from Britain, France and the United States were pressing for another sanctions vote right away, China and Russia in particular wanted to wait for another report from the nuclear monitoring agency.
 Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, whose often volatile relationship with her Russian counterpart, Sergey V. Lavrov, erupted again this week as Russia refused to go along with immediate sanctions, sought on Friday to minimize the differences between their countries. 
 ''We've made it very clear that we've always wanted to keep the two tracks under way,'' she told reporters in New York. American officials routinely use the phrase ''two tracks'' to refer to both the sanctions and the negotiations with Iran. ''We will be watching to see what progress takes place.''
 But her deputy, R. Nicholas Burns, the top United States negotiator on the Iran issue, acknowledged that ''the alchemy of this group is such that anything is going to be a compromise.'' He took issue with the speech by Iran's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, before the General Assembly this week, when Mr. Ahmadinejad said that the nuclear dispute with the West, which believes that Iran is working on a nuclear weapons program, is now ''closed.'' 
 ''I'm sorry, he was badly mistaken,'' Mr. Burns told reporters during a news conference. ''Here, he has six ministers saying so.''
 Iran has maintained that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes.
 Clearly, American diplomats were hoping for a bit more this week, but signs emerged early on that they would not get it. During a lunch of ministers from the Group of 8 industrialized nations on Wednesday, Ms. Rice and Mr. Lavrov exchanged sharp words on the right time to push for more Iran sanctions. 
 One European diplomat who was present said that ''it's getting to the point that you can't get any work done if those two are in the room together,'' referring to Ms. Rice and Mr. Lavrov. The diplomat spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about tension between Ms. Rice and Mr. Lavrov.
 Mr. Lavrov told The Associated Press after the lunch that he had strong words with Ms. Rice about whether the time was right for new sanctions when the International Atomic Energy Agency had struck an agreement with Iran about its past activities. Ms. Rice has been clear that she does not think much of the recent forays by Mohamed ElBaradei, the agency's director, into the Iran negotiations, telling reporters on her airplane last week that the agency would be better off leaving diplomacy to diplomats.
 Mr. ElBaradei reached an agreement in July with Iranian officials in which Tehran agreed to provide the agency with answers to questions about more than two decades of nuclear activity, most of it secret.

HEADLINE: For Housing, the Summer of the Unsold

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
IN the heat of August, the American home market wilted.
 Reports this week showed weak sales of both new and existing homes during the month, and the first two large home builders to report summer profits called the market dismal.
 ''The economy got to the point where pricing was just unrealistic and maybe even ridiculous,'' said Stuart Miller, the chief executive of the Lennar Corporation. ''August really seemed to be a melting pot of all things negative.'' 
 The story was similar at KB Home. ''The oversupply of unsold new and resale homes and downward pressure on new-home values has worsened in many of our markets,'' said Jeffrey Mezger, the chief executive.
 He said the market declined throughout the summer, but ''the deterioration accelerated dramatically in the month of August.''
 Those two companies are the only major builders with quarters ending in August, and between them operate in most of the major markets, including California, Florida, Illinois, Texas and New York. 
 ''It is an unusual time where almost every market across the country is similarly impaired,'' Mr. Miller said. Some were hurt less than others, he said, ''but all of the markets are down.''
 In some markets, he said, the company cannot sell homes for more than they would cost to build, even if the land were free.
 As one of the accompanying charts shows, Lennar's rate of both new orders and deliveries -- final sales -- were down more than 40 percent from the previous year.
 With sales of both new and existing homes down, more homes are now on the market than ever before -- almost 4.5 million, a figure that is nearly double the number in early 2005, when prices were rising and home builders were reporting high profits. 
 And many of those homes have been on the market for a while. Of the 178,000 completed new homes that were available for sale at the end of July, fewer than 15 percent found buyers in August. That was the lowest rate in more than a decade.
 In late 2006, it appeared that the housing market had stabilized after falling, with new homes selling at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of about one million, and investors bid up the price of home builder stocks.
 But with all the bad news, those prices have fallen to new lows. The pace of new-home sales in August was just 795,000, a seven-year low.
 Prices are falling in most markets, according to the S.&P./Case-Shiller index of home prices, and in July -- the figures reported this week -- they were down 4.5 percent, year-over-year, for a 10-city composite.
 Futures are traded on that index, and while volume is very low and thus perhaps of little forecasting value, the futures prices indicate that home values are expected to keep falling until 2010.
 The biggest reason for the August plunge appears to have been the chaos in the mortgage market, where a number of lenders have gone out of business.
 Many buyers with good credit can still get mortgages, but their purchases often depend on selling their old homes, something that is getting much harder as other would-be buyers find they cannot get financing, or cannot sell their old homes.
 As 2006 ended, economists generally thought the economy had weathered the housing decline with little effect on consumers. Now many are not so sure. 
 ''The talk at Friday night dinner parties is going to be how little the house down the road sold for,'' said Robert J. Barbera, the chief economist of ITG. And that, he said, is likely to restrain spending as homeowners feel less wealthy.

HEADLINE: Michigan to Cut Services if Budget Talks Fail

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY

 BODY:
With time running out for Michigan lawmakers to solve a $1.75 billion gap in the state's next budget, residents are bracing for a shutdown of some services as early as Monday. 
 By week's end, the budget impasse in Lansing, which has dragged on for months, had reached a crisis. Legislative meetings ran into early morning hours. Political leaders, including Gov. Jennifer M. Granholm, a Democrat, and Michael D. Bishop, the Republican majority leader in the State Senate, went on television to make their cases to the public. 
 And late yesterday, Ms. Granholm notified about 35,000 of the 53,000 state employees not to come to work on Monday unless a deal is reached over the weekend, when lawmakers intend to continue meeting around the clock. Among services to be shut: secretary of state offices including those that issue driver's licenses, most unemployment offices, highway construction projects and state lottery sales. Only Michigan state troopers needed for ''critical law enforcement'' will be asked to report to work. 
 Essential agencies that deal with health or safety -- state prisons, for instance -- will remain open, Ms. Granholm said.
 Michigan, where the financial year officially begins on Oct. 1, is one of only two states that have not agreed on a budget for the 2008 fiscal year. Wisconsin, the other state, is still working on its budget, even though its new financial year began on July 1; but there, by law, spending, taxing and services automatically proceed at current levels until a new budget is passed.
 In Michigan, where there is no such provision, such serious budget impasses have been rare, and this year's is seen as a reflection of the dire economic circumstances in the state as a whole. Long the center of the nation's auto industry, Michigan has struggled with manufacturing job losses in what some have dubbed a single-state recession. 
 While many states found themselves with budget surpluses this year, Michigan faced deficits, both for the expected budget for 2008 and for the current fiscal year, said Arturo Perez, who follows budgets for the National Conference of State Legislatures. Lawmakers had to spend much of their session just worrying about sorting out this year's shortfall, Mr. Perez said, before discussing the 2008 budget.
 Raymond E. Basham, a Michigan state senator and a Democrat, said, ''We're up against it as a state in more ways than one.'' 
 In part, Michigan's leaders have split along partisan lines on how to erase the deficit. Governor Granholm and some other Democrats, who gained a majority in the State House of Representatives in last year's elections, have supported raising taxes as needed. Republicans, who control the State Senate, have called for spending cuts.
 But even some House Democrats have been reluctant to support Ms. Granholm's proposals, said Bill Ballenger, the editor of Inside Michigan Politics. ''It's fear of recalls, fear of getting beat,'' he said. ''But it's right down to crunch time now.''

HEADLINE: F.T.C. Goes After Deceptive Ads

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI

 BODY:
A RECENT warning by the federal government to overly aggressive mortgage advertisers had an immediate impact, local industry executives say. But consumers should remain on the alert, as always.
 ''You don't see or hear these ads as frequently, but they're still around,'' said Richard Biondi, the principal in RJB Financial Consultant, a mortgage broker in Farmingdale, N.Y. ''These advertisers have not dried up and blown away.''
 The Federal Trade Commission earlier this month issued a warning to about 200 mortgage advertisers and media companies whose advertising practices ''may violate federal law,'' the commission said. It did not name the companies. 
 According to Lucy Morris, a senior attorney in the F.T.C.'s bureau of consumer protection, the ads generally focused on nontraditional loans like adjustable-rate mortgages that have very low introductory rates and option ARMs, which are a form of adjustable-rate mortgage. With these, borrowers can choose to ignore the nominal interest rate on the loan for some payments, but if they do so for a long enough period, they face a far more burdensome repayment schedule.
 Ms. Morris said federal regulations require advertisers to disclose a loan's annual percentage rate ''at least as conspicuously'' as the introductory, or teaser, rate. ''But what we saw were advertisers telling what they considered the best parts of the loan, and not the full story, like the full cost of the loan, and when the payments would go up,'' she said.
 The trade commission's action will have less impact now than it would have a year or two ago, analysts said, when these loans were much more widely available and much more heavily marketed, particularly to borrowers with poor credit. 
 In recent months, such loans have become scarce because investors who buy subprime loans have abandoned such products, and many mortgage brokers and lenders specializing in subprime loans have gone out of business.
 Allen Fishbein, the director of credit and housing policy for the Consumer Federation of America, an advocacy group based in Washington, said that nontraditional mortgages were still available, albeit on a more limited basis, to those with above-average, or prime, credit scores. ''So consumers should remain on warning that there still may be bad practices alive and well,'' he said.
 Studies by advocacy groups that focus on ethnic minorities have shown that ads for nontraditional mortgages tend to appear more frequently in Spanish-language newspapers and other publications more common in inner cities, Mr. Fishbein said.
 This played a role in the ''higher incidence of subprime lending in the minority community,'' he said. 
 ''There are indications that many of these borrowers could have qualified for cheaper prime loans if they had known about them,'' he added.
 Ms. Morris, the F.T.C. lawyer, said that as a result of the inquiry leading to the commission's warning, ''we will be conducting some investigations'' of lenders, along with an undisclosed number of continuing inquiries into deceptive mortgage marketing.
 Mr. Biondi of RJB Financial Consultant said that consumers could expect the questionable ads to return ''once things quiet down'' among federal regulators and legislators rushing to contain the damage of the mortgage credit crisis. ''Unless the right controls are put in place,'' he said, ''these guys will sneak in the backdoor again.'' 
 Consumers who spot a mortgage ad that they think is deceptive can report it to the trade commission at (877) 382-4357.

HEADLINE: Stranger At The Door

BYLINE: By EMILY BRADY

 BODY:
CHANTEE JOHNSON says her earliest memory of the house on 178th Street in Springfield Gardens, Queens, is the day in the early 1970s when her parents took her and her siblings to see their new home. 
 As the five children -- soon to be seven -- raced through the two-story, green and white frame house, Ms. Johnson remembers marveling at its size. There were three bedrooms, two bathrooms, a dining room and, best of all, a yard that was home to an apple tree and bursting with the potential for mischief. To swing the deal, her father took out a mortgage, for $22,200. 
 More than 30 years later, the apple tree towers over the garage, the green and white paint has been replaced by beige, and Ms. Johnson's parents are dead. Ms. Johnson, now a 36-year-old school bus driver, shares the house with her three children and her sister Lisa. 
 ''I love this neighborhood and this house,'' Chantee Johnson said the other day, sitting at the family's dining room table. ''It's something that I don't want to lose.''
 But she may. On the table, she spread out the contents of a battered manila folder containing a hundred pages of legal documents that she and her sister have gathered to fight an impending foreclosure. 
 Many people have been hit by the recent crisis involving mortgages. The crisis has hobbled developers, whose newly built houses stand unbought, as well as young, first-time homebuyers, who in recent years stretched themselves too thin in the bullish housing market. But it has also trapped longstanding homeowners, like the Johnson sisters, whose families paid off their original mortgages years ago and who never dreamed they would be at risk. 
 Although the wave of foreclosures is national in scope, no borough in New York has been harder hit than Queens. According to RealtyTrac, a firm that collects real estate data, foreclosure filings in Queens in the second quarter of this year were 92 percent higher than in the second quarter of 2006, and the percentage of households in Queens that were in foreclosure was roughly twice the percentage statewide.
 Within the borough, a foreclosure map assembled by the Neighborhood Economic Development Advocacy Project, a Manhattan nonprofit group, shows that the troubles are clustered in South Jamaica, Cambria Heights and Springfield Gardens. These are largely minority neighborhoods, of the sort that were a focus of the risky loan offers at the center of the foreclosure wave.
 Southeastern Queens, with its tree-lined streets, tidy front yards, and minivans and Cadillacs parked in garages and in front of houses, does not outwardly appear troubled. But a closer look reveals signs of stress, among them fliers stapled to lampposts every few blocks that advertise ''Houses and Land Wanted. Cash'' or ''Stop Foreclosure. Don't Lose Your Home. Get Help Today.''
 The Johnson sisters thought they were safe; their father paid off the house before he died in 1995. But hard times began five years later, when their mother, who had only limited health insurance, took out a loan on the house to help pay for her double-bypass surgery. She died the next year, and three years ago, in 2004, Lisa Johnson decided to refinance the mortgage.
 TO this day, she does not understand exactly what happened, but somehow the refinanced mortgage ended up costing the family $2,700 a month. With Chantee's pay as a bus driver and Lisa's as a data-entry clerk and a production assistant for a clothing firm, the sisters could not handle the payments. They defaulted on the mortgage last fall. 
 ''Sometimes,'' Lisa Johnson said ruefully, ''ignorance can get you in a lot of trouble.'' 
 She is among the many confused homeowners who are frequent visitors to the office of Peggy Morris, executive director of Jamaica Housing Improvement, a local nonprofit group. 
 ''They often just don't understand the financial transaction they got involved with,'' Ms. Morris said of the borrowers in the area. ''They're not digging their own graves; the brokers, the attorneys and the banks weren't giving them the correct information.'' 
 Another resident of Springfield Gardens, a 73-year-old retired housekeeper named Bobbie Jean Morrison, bought her baby-blue bungalow on Montauk Street on Nov. 22, 1963, the day President Kennedy was shot. She paid off the $15,000 home in full, but six years ago, she refinanced it to pay for new oak cabinets and other items for the kitchen. 
 In 2004, she and her husband, who works as a handyman at a Manhattan apartment building, fell behind on the payments of $1,800 a month. 
 ''I didn't know what I was signing,'' Ms. Morrison said of one of the stream of documents that have come her way in the past few years. The house now legally belongs to someone else, and she is battling eviction. If Ms. Morrison is forced out, it is her garden, with its large weeping willow and pots of purple pansies and red geraniums, that she will miss most. 
 The Johnson sisters faced a similar situation; in May they were told that their house would be sold at auction on June 15. Every time the two women returned home, they feared they might find the front door padlocked. Chantee Johnson took to writing down the license plate numbers of unfamiliar cars parked nearby, thinking the drivers might have arrived to take her house.
 At the last moment, the sisters found a way to stop the sale; since the house had been willed to all seven children, it had been invalid for Lisa alone to refinance it. But the case rolls on, with the sisters headed back to court soon. 
 For Chantee Johnson, the hardest part about losing her home would be leaving her childhood bedroom, where she still sleeps, with its two big windows that look out on nearby rooftops and the street. She would also miss the neighbors to whom she has grown close over the years, like the elderly man who lives next door. She has known him for so long that she calls him Dad.

HEADLINE: Costly Fuel Is Never Far From a Match

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
THERE are deep roots to Myanmar's current unrest, pitting its repressive regime against Buddhist monks, but the immediate spark was the junta's unexpected decision in August to double fuel prices. Overnight, diesel prices skyrocketed, and compressed natural gas rose fivefold. 
 In this respect, Myanmar is not an isolated case. Rising oil prices in recent years have created all kinds of headaches as they have rippled across the world. Many governments, especially in the developing world, have had to choose between raising domestic subsidies to offset the increases or letting the people bear the brunt. 
 Neither choice -- higher government spending or the risk of popular discontent -- has great appeal. 
 In oil-rich Iran, civil unrest spread through Tehran this summer after the government rationed gasoline in an effort to curb the country's addiction to cheap fuel; gasoline in Iran, imported because the country lacks refining capacity, is heavily subsidized and cost about 40 cents a gallon at the time. After two days of upheaval, the Islamic theocracy restored order and kept the policy.
 In Nigeria, the outcome was different. Striking oil workers in June threatened to shut down the country's oil production if fuel subsidies were dropped. Faced with the threat of losing its biggest source of revenue, the government quickly backed down. 
 Fuel prices go to the heart of people's ability to move, stay warm or feed themselves. So it is no surprise that governments around the world have tried to blunt the effects of oil prices that have tripled in the past four years. 
 But interfering with energy markets can be a risky and costly game. Prices kept high by market forces and taxes dampen expectations of cheap fuel. Fuel subsidies do the opposite, and countries that rely on them play with fire. 
 ''Some countries are hiding the reality of high fuel prices to keep political peace,'' said David L. Goldwyn, an assistant secretary of energy during the Clinton administration. ''Nigeria caved, but it's not a sustainable strategy. The more they do it, the more they pump up demand with cheap energy.''
 The problem is that fuel subsidies can quickly add up -- especially when oil prices keep rising as they have since 2003. It has been estimated that Yemen, for example, devotes 9 percent of its gross domestic product to holding down energy prices. 
 Only a handful of countries provide very high subsidies on their retail fuel sales. These include Venezuela, Turkmenistan, Syria, Algeria, Angola and Malaysia, and, unsurprisingly, most of them are oil producers.
 In fact, most countries have allowed domestic prices to creep up. Drivers in Tunisia, Honduras and Pakistan all paid more for their gasoline than Americans did last year, according to a survey of fuel prices compiled by GTZ, a German consulting firm. The survey found only 20 countries where the price of gasoline was below $2 a gallon, that is, lower than the cost of refining it. 
 In most European countries, the opposite is true. Governments slap on high taxes -- sometimes as high as 80 percent of the cost -- in part to discourage consumption. In the Netherlands, gasoline cost $6.40 a gallon last year. 
 In the United States, where taxes represent about 20 percent of gasoline prices, regular gas averaged about $2.35 a gallon last year. It's up to $2.80 these days. Still, the mere mention of raising gasoline taxes remains almost tantamount to political suicide. 
 When it comes to energy policy, the most closely watched country is China, whose surge in demand has helped propel oil prices upward. China needs to finely balance its need for growth while trying to keep a lid on energy use, both to control pollution and to keep prices from skyrocketing. 
 Though pollution has taken a toll on China's environment, the restive demands of the rural have-nots left far behind by the urban haves cannot be ignored. Last year, there were 90,000 protests against local governments, according to Michael Green, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
 In most cases, fuel prices were not the cause of these protests, Mr. Green said, but they point to the risk of upheaval China faces: Each year, 20 million people move to big cities from the countryside in search of work. 
 ''The mandate of the Communist Party is economic development,'' Mr. Green said. ''This is why it is so hard for them to ration energy demand. It's very difficult for the leadership in Beijing to develop a harmonious society if they cap energy demand.'' 
 Still, the Chinese leadership has been gradually allowing fuel prices to increase, although its domestic state-run refineries still sell gasoline at a loss. 
 Indonesia illustrates the risk for authoritarian regimes. In 1998, large-scale student riots sparked by higher energy prices led to the fall of the autocratic president, Suharto. But in recent years, the Indonesian government has managed to cut back its subsidies without sparking dangerous riots. 
 ''The more authoritarian the regime, the more vulnerable it is to mobilized dissent when they try to raise energy prices,'' Mr. Green said. ''When democratic institutions are stronger, governments have been better able to manage energy demands. That's the lesson from Indonesia.''

HEADLINE: As the Dollar Falls, New Doors Open to Currency Bets

BYLINE: By J. ALEX TARQUINIO

 BODY:
THE dollar's recent swoon is a textbook example of just how volatile foreign exchange markets can be. The new lows for the dollar brought quick profits to many investors, but the ''easy money'' has already been made, said Ed Yardeni, the president of Yardeni Research.
 ''Trading in currencies is a dangerous game,'' he said. Whether the dollar weakens further or begins to rise will largely depend on what the Federal Reserve does next, he said, and that is very difficult to handicap.
 This month, the central bank cut its benchmark interest rate by half a percentage point, to 4.75 percent; the cut was bigger than Wall Street had expected. The Fed also reduced the rate it charges banks for emergency short-term loans by half a point. 
 ''There is some expectation that there will be more rate cuts,'' Mr. Yardeni said. ''But I think the Fed was aggressive enough in its recent action that it might not have to cut rates again any time soon.'' 
 If the Fed keeps rates as they are, the dollar may stabilize and start trading in a narrow range against some major currencies, like the euro and the Japanese yen, in Mr. Yardeni's view. That could change the fortunes of investors who have been using a spate of new exchange-traded funds to bet that the dollar will keep falling. These E.T.F.'s have made it much easier for individuals to buy and sell the British pound, the Swiss franc or even the Mexican peso. And some E.T.F.'s allow investors to bet that the dollar will rise or fall against a basket of currencies.
 Many individual investors have been drawn to these funds. Tim Meyer, the E.T.F. business manager at Rydex Investments, estimated that only about 30 percent of the roughly $1.1 billion that has flowed into the company's eight currency E.T.F.'s this year was from institutional investors, like pension plans and hedge funds. He said 50 percent probably came through financial planners and the other 20 percent from online brokerage accounts.
 Rydex Investments, based in Rockville, Md., has created many of the new E.T.F.'s. Each holds currency in a bank account at JPMorgan Chase in London. The funds pay interest, which is based on the overnight money market rate in each currency, minus fund expenses.
 Although the dollar has fallen against a broad range of currencies this year, Mr. Yardeni said the picture might soon become more complex. The dollar could rise against some major currencies over the next six months, while falling against others, he said, depending on economic conditions and interest rates in each country.
 For example, the Japanese yen, which has been floundering for years, has surprised investors by rallying against the dollar recently. But Mr. Yardeni said the yen could level off -- or even reverse course -- unless Japan's central bank raised the country's razor-thin interest rates. With fresh signs of deflation in Japan, he said, that may not happen soon.
 As for the euro, which traded above $1.40 for the first time this month, Mr. Yardeni said he could imagine it going as high as $1.45 but not $1.50. And he predicted that the British pound, now trading at more than twice the value of the dollar, could fall to around $1.85 over the next six months.
 ''We might see a little divergence, where the dollar weakens against the euro and strengthens relative to the pound,'' Mr. Yardeni said, because Britain's economy has a lot of the same risk factors that the American economy does now -- including a shaky mortgage market.
 The currencies with the best outlook are the Australian and Canadian dollars, he said, ''because they have what the world wants now, which is raw materials.'' 
 Earlier this month, the Canadian dollar reached parity with the American dollar for the first time in more than 30 years. But Mr. Yardeni said he thought both the Canadian and Australian dollars might rise an additional 5 percent or so against the American dollar. 
 Michael Metz, the chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer & Company, said it was too late to buy the British pound or the euro, calling both currencies ''grossly overvalued.'' He said the Japanese yen was still attractive but not as much as it was in February, when Rydex introduced the CurrencyShares Japanese Yen Trust.
 ''When that E.T.F. was created, the yen was the cheapest currency around,'' Mr. Metz said. ''But if you want an alternative to the dollar now, I think it's the Swiss franc.'' He said that the Swiss currency had not appreciated in tandem with the euro, largely because Switzerland has lower interest rates.
 Many investors do not want to pick and choose among foreign currencies, said Bruce Bond, the president and chief executive of PowerShares Capital Management in Wheaton, Ill. PowerShares offers two E.T.F.'s that use futures contracts to make bets on the dollar versus a basket of six currencies: the yen, euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, Swedish krona and Swiss franc. If the dollar rises against these currencies, investors in one of the E.T.F.'s, the PowerShares DB U.S. Dollar Bullish fund, would make money. If the dollar falls, the PowerShares DB U.S. Dollar Bearish fund would come out ahead. Neither fund uses leverage.
 The company has also created an E.T.F., PowerShares DB G10 Currency Harvest, intended to allow investors to bet against currencies in countries with low interest rates and to take long positions in those with higher rates. Currently, the fund has long positions in the Australian dollar, the New Zealand dollar and the British pound, and short positions in the Japanese yen, the Swiss franc and the Swedish krona. 
 THERE are special tax consequences associated with the three PowerShares funds. Investors who own E.T.F.'s that use derivatives, like futures contracts, have to declare capital gains each year -- even if they still own the funds -- and 40 percent of the gains will be taxed at the higher rate for short-term capital gains. So experts recommend holding such E.T.F.'s in a tax-advantaged account like an Individual Retirement Account.
 Alternatively, Mr. Metz said that it might be simpler for investors who are worried about a further decline in the dollar to put a small portion of their portfolios into gold. He recommended one of the E.T.F.'s that invest in actual bars of gold, like the StreetTracks Gold Shares fund or iShares Comex Gold Trust.
 ''I think there will be a big move by central banks to build up their gold reserves, which they have really sold off in recent years,'' Mr. Metz said.

Exploration, Not Memorization
 To the Editor:
 Re ''The Garlanded Classroom'' (Sept. 23):
 It is a sad commentary on early childhood education in New York City when the main critique of the Reggio Emilia approach is that it is not proven to boost the standardized test scores of those entering kindergarten. 
 The Reggio approach requires children to engage in complex problem solving to address issues that are of immediate importance. Academic skills are taught, but are done so conceptually through an integrated approach as children investigate and explore their world under the guidance of their teachers. This is vastly different from the method of rote memorization and regurgitation that we see so often in American schools. 
 The Reggio approach is not new. It draws upon the work of John Dewey, Maria Montessori and many other noteworthy educational philosophers. However, many preschools have abandoned best teaching practices for test preparation. 
 Standardized tests, most experts agree, do not accurately reflect ability in the preschool population and may be economically and culturally biased. The Reggio approach is a call to early childhood educators to re-focus on the goal of instilling in young children a love of learning -- a gift that will last a lifetime.
 Elizabeth Matthews Upper East Side
 The writer is an assistant professor of early childhood education, Hunter College. 
 To the Editor:
 I was thrilled to read your article about the Reggio Emilia philosophy. 
 During my tenure at Beginnings Nursery School I witnessed the development of many long-term projects that reflected the context of living in New York City. Two of these projects, a study of Union Square Park and the opening of a store, provided children exposure and experience with the following: writing stories, counting, problem solving, mapping, measuring, designing, drawing and research. 
 They became citizens of the community and greater New York. These children were prepared for any kind of school -- progressive, traditional, public or private. 
 I have to argue with those who say these children aren't ''ready'' for challenging programs. As senior director of Blue Man Creativity Center, I'm certain that children who are experiencing collaboration with teachers will have an exceptional educational experience that supports their literal and visual ideas. With that foundation, they will be able to take on the world! 
 Jane Racoosin Brooklyn Heights
 To the Editor:
 As a teacher at Beansprouts Preschool in Brooklyn, I note that child-centered education, with art as the students' primary expressive tool, is by no means exclusively the approach of Reggio Emilia schools. 
 Indeed, it is difficult to imagine a preschool classroom that takes any other form.

 Unearthed Bones on Staten Island
 To the Editor:
 ''Honoring the Bones'' (Sept. 23) does not reflect the deliberate and legally required public review process the New York State Dormitory Authority is undertaking to determine the final resting place of human remains unearthed at the site of a new state courthouse on Staten Island. 
 As the state agency overseeing this project, the Dormitory Authority has already sought and received significant public input on this matter, and will hold additional public hearings in the coming months on how best to re-bury the remains. 
 Our careful consideration of all points of view presented to us is neither a ''protracted skirmish'' nor a ''cultural dust storm.'' In fact, it would be unlawful for the authority to take a position before we complete our historic preservation and environmental reviews, despite the wishes of those advocating that we rush to judgment in their favor.
 Our duty is to ensure that the remains are respectfully treated, that they are appropriately re-buried and that they not be used as pawns by those pursuing other agendas.

 Columbia University and Eminent Domain
 To the Editor:
 The most contentious issue facing the Columbia University expansion plan is eminent domain. Yet your Sept. 23 editorial ''Helping Columbia, and West Harlem'' does not even mention it. 
 Repeatedly, members of the West Harlem community have stated at numerous public meetings, most recently the Manhattan borough president's Sept. 19 hearing, that they strongly oppose the use of eminent domain in the Columbia Plan. West Harlem's Community Board 9 has voted unanimously to oppose the use of eminent domain. Clearly, Columbia needs to take the use of eminent domain off the table for there to be any realistic chance of Columbia and the West Harlem community coming together over the expansion plan.
 The condemnation and taking of private property by the government and giving it to a private university for its benefit should not be an element of the expansion plan. To ignore this crucial issue is to miss an integral part of the opposition to the plan.

HEADLINE: A Portraitist Of a Subdued, Literary Korea

BYLINE: By DENNIS LIM

 BODY:
THE South Korean director Lee Chang-dong occupies a unique, somewhat contradictory position in his country's film scene. As the first filmmaker to serve as South Korean minister of culture (from 2003 to 2004) and a longtime advocate of the quota system that obliges his nation's theaters to show a minimum number of local films, he has played a central role in the resurgence of Korean cinema.
 As a director, though, he does not exactly fit in. While the best-known Korean movies of the past few years are stylish, violent genre works -- crime thrillers like ''Oldboy'' or effects-heavy fantasies like ''The Host'' -- Mr. Lee's films have a more subdued, literary flavor, and they tend to defy easy classification. 
 Despite being a fixture on the international festival circuit for some time (having won prizes at Venice, Vancouver and Karlovy Vary), Mr. Lee has been somewhat overshadowed by flashier compatriots like Park Chanwook and Kim Ki-duk. ''Secret Sunshine,'' his fourth film, is his first since leaving office and also the one that has brought him the most attention. It had its premiere in May at the Cannes Film Festival (where its star, Jeon Do-yeon, was named best actress), recently played in Toronto and Telluride and will be screened at the New York Film Festival on Monday and Tuesday. (The film is awaiting a distribution deal for the United States.)
 As ''Secret Sunshine'' begins, Shin-ae (Ms. Jeon), a young widow from Seoul, is moving with her little boy to her late husband's hometown, a provincial city called Miryang. (The literal translation provides the English title.) Under the disapproving scrutiny of the gossipy locals, she sets up a piano school and finds a puppyish admirer in a friendly mechanic (the popular actor Song Kang-ho, last seen here in ''The Host''). Before long a blindsiding tragedy sends the protagonist -- and the film -- spinning into an altogether different orbit. As Shin-ae agonizes over the meaning of suffering and the mystery of salvation, the movie evolves into a provocative study of madness and belief. 
 ''One of the most important things to me was to find a way to portray things that are not visible to the naked eye, faith being one of them,'' Mr. Lee said, speaking via a translator in Toronto this month. 
 A former high school teacher and novelist who turned to filmmaking in his 40s, Mr. Lee, now 53, has a knack for depicting the invisible. His films are intricate character portraits that succeed at animating the larger forces at work in Korean history and society. 
 His first feature, ''Green Fish'' (1997), is a gangster drama rooted in the dark side of the so-called Asian economic miracle. ''Peppermint Candy'' (1999) mingles personal and national history, recounting the life of a troubled man in reverse chronology, through two decades of defining traumas. The movie rewinds all the way to the Kwangju massacre of 1980, when the government cracked down on a pro-democracy demonstration, killing at least 200 protesters, many of them students. (That was the year Mr. Lee graduated from his university, with a degree in Korean literature.)
 ''Oasis,'' which won several prizes at Venice in 2002, chronicles the forbidden romance between a mildly retarded ne'er-do-well and a young woman with cerebral palsy. Mr. Lee leavens his forthright naturalism with sprinklings of magic realism, as if insulating the unlikely lovers from the hostile prejudices of the outside world. (Both ''Peppermint Candy'' and ''Oasis'' are available in the United States on DVD.) 
 ''Secret Sunshine,'' perhaps Mr. Lee's most unflinching film, acknowledges its heroine's need for spiritual succor even as it takes a coolly skeptical look at the role of evangelical Christianity in Korean society. ''Christians are quite a powerful group in South Korea, and people on the production team were worried about what the reception would be,'' Mr. Lee said. When the film opened in South Korea in May, he added, ''some people were critical, but there was also positive feedback. Some pastors were recommending the film to their church members.'' 
 According to Sung-Deuk Oak, an assistant professor of Korean Christianity at the University of California, Los Angeles, about a third of South Koreans are Christian and the majority of South Korean Christians are conservative, evangelical Protestants. Mr. Oak said that ''Secret Sunshine'' was a hot topic of conversation in churches and the news media in South Korea this year. 
 ''Non-Christians are uncomfortable because the movie has a lot of Christian things,'' he said. ''Christians are uncomfortable because Christian messages and activities are depicted in a simple and superficial way.'' 
 Still, Mr. Oak added, Mr. Lee's film raises ''heavy theological questions'' and is nowhere near as condescending or stereotypical in its portrayal of the devout as ''Lady Vengeance,'' the concluding installment in Mr. Park's revenge trilogy. The film also deals with forgiveness and redemption, albeit in a very different way. 
 Mr. Lee said he had been careful not to exaggerate or caricature Christian rites. ''In terms of the services and prayer meetings, it was very realistic, more or less a documentary approach,'' he said. ''If people feel uncomfortable or find some elements of it a little ridiculous, they might be admitting there's a problem with the way Christianity is practiced in Korea.''
 A good part of the film's power derives from the range and intensity of Ms. Jeon's performance. Mr. Lee has a reputation for demanding many takes. ''I am notorious for giving actors a hard time,'' he said with a smile. ''I believe that acting should not be about actions, but reactions.'' By the end of the shoot, he said, his lead actress ''was starting to hate me.'' But, he added, ''Maybe that helped her since her character really hates her God at the end of the movie.'' 
 Asked about his own religious beliefs, Mr. Lee quoted Ludwig Wittgenstein -- ''Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent'' -- and added, ''That's my position on God and faith.'' 
 ''Secret Sunshine'' ends on a note at once ambiguous and hopeful. Its limpid, humble approach to suffering and grace suggests something like ''Breaking the Waves'' stripped of mysticism, or a rationalist version of ''The Pilgrim's Progress.''
 ''Shin-ae is always looking up and never at the ground,'' Mr. Lee said, pointing out a recurring motif. The film opens with a wide shot of the sky and concludes with the camera trained on a patch of earth. ''I wanted to show that the meaning of life is not far from where we are,'' he said. ''It's not up there. It's here, in our actual life.''

HEADLINE: A Businesslike Tower, Overshadowed By a Famous Sibling

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER GRAY. 
E-mail: streetscapes@nytimes.com

 BODY:
THE soaring lines and Art Deco details of 500 Fifth Avenue, at 42nd Street, make it a mismatched 60-story bookend to the similarly styled Empire State Building eight blocks south. Both completed in 1931, they were designed by Shreve, Lamb & Harmon with the businesslike economy typical of the firm, which valued efficiency as much as aesthetics. 
 Richmond H. Shreve and William F. Lamb were working for the elite Beaux-Arts firm Carrere & Hastings in the early 1920s, and were an essential part of its expansion into commercial design, as in their 1921 Fisk Building, at 250 West 57th Street, between Broadway and Eighth Avenue. 
 The two men split off from the older firm around 1924, and they continued on their own with solid but rarely inspired design. 
 The commission for the 34th Street structure that became the Empire State Building first surfaced in late 1928, and it was while the design was still in the office that Arthur L. Harmon joined the firm. 
 Six months later, the 42nd Street booster Walter J. Salmon hired the new partnership to design a 60-story office building at the northwest corner of 42nd and Fifth, considered the second most valuable corner in New York -- the first being the southeast corner of Wall Street and Broadway. 
 Their early sketch of 500 Fifth Avenue shows a series of setbacks leading to a plain shaft with thick piers, as if to emphasize massiveness. Early designs for the Empire State Building showed the same treatment, but by late 1929 each building had been simplified to a chunky base of several setbacks with a soaring, sheer tower emphasized by vertical lines: at the Empire State, shining metal; at 500 Fifth, bays of windows with dark terra-cotta spandrels merging with dark window glass and frames above and below. 
 On the Empire State Building the architects exercised absolute discipline over every detail, to assure the quickest, most scientific construction. For instance, to avoid delays and ground-floor delivery snarls, they charted each piece of steel from design to fabrication to shipment to placement, a tight ballet of scheduling. 
 And on 500 Fifth, they closely calculated elevator loading and peak use, to make sure they could empty and fill the building with a minimum of delay. They worked closely with Mr. Salmon and his real estate advisers to produce a most businesslike business building. 
 The central section on the 42nd Street side leaps up the facade along seven dark strips, like racetracks, ending in Art Deco-style scalloping. But the entrance is on Fifth Avenue, under a relief statue of a goddess holding a model of 500 Fifth itself. The outer lobby has been heavily altered, but the inner lobby seems almost intact, with richly veined marble of gold and gray; the Empire State Building lobby also uses highly figured stone. 
 In late 1930 The New York Times praised 500 Fifth as a ''thoroughly frank expression of the requirements of an up-to-date office building.'' This might not have pleased an artistically inclined architect, but such organization was the watchword of Shreve, Lamb & Harmon. In a 1941 interview, The Architectural Record said of Mr. Shreve that ''order, forethought and system are words that might be his middle name.'' But Mr. Salmon's building received little real discussion as a work of architecture, opening as it did in the shadow of its 34th Street sibling.
 The opening of 500 Fifth took place in March 1931, and that of the Empire State in May, right at the beginning of hard times. In his book ''The Empire State Building'' (Scribner, 1995) John Tauranac said that by May, Mr. Salmon had rented only a handful of floors in 500 Fifth. In 1945 the B-25 bomber that hit the Empire State Building just missed the top of 500 Fifth. 
 Shreve, Lamb & Harmon continued a successful practice with buildings like the boxy 1938 Hunter College, at 68th Street and Park Avenue, and the streamlined 1950 MONY Building, at Broadway and 55th Street -- the one with the weather indicator on top.
 As with many big buildings, 500 Fifth is as interesting from the back (the north side) as from its street facades -- perhaps even more so. Because the architects put the elevators and utilities on the north wall, it presents a large, unbroken surface of tawny, variegated brick, like a Kansas wheat field. Three dramatic black strips of terra cotta thus have a good backdrop against which to rise to the Art Deco top. 
 In the early 1970s -- way after the deaths of the founding partners -- Shreve, Lamb & Harmon proposed recladding the Empire State Building to increase its height, an idea received with general alarm and soon dropped. Not long afterward, the firm designed the combination office and school building at 34th Street and Park Avenue, a tower set at an angle to the street. 
 The practice changed hands several times until November 1995 -- when, according to Donald Grossman, an architect there since 1971 and by then an owner -- it shut down.
 ''We were no longer being called in for our expertise,'' he said. ''It was just, 'Give us your price.' It wasn't fun anymore.''

HEADLINE: The Muted Roars of Hogs and R.V.'s

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
FROM the trading floors of Wall Street to the boardroom of the Federal Reserve, the big question being debated these days is whether a recession is looming, especially if consumers already reeling from the housing meltdown cut back on spending.
 While the number crunchers focus on stats like interest rate spreads and housing starts, Ron Muhlenkamp takes a much simpler approach. Mr. Muhlenkamp, a mutual fund manager based in Pittsburgh with $2 billion in assets in the fund that bears his name, closely watches the performance of two classic American companies: Harley-Davidson and Winnebago Industries. 
 ''Motorcycles and motor homes are the kind of things that people think about before they buy,'' says Mr. Muhlenkamp, a gravelly-voiced veteran of the money management business who graduated from Harvard Business School way back in 1968 and has scored outsize returns since starting his fund in 1988. ''Nobody needs a Harley. They're bought when people want 'em, so they're poster boys for the economy.''
 Now, Harley-Davidson and Winnebago are definitely flashing yellow. In early September, Harley, the 104-year-old motorcycle maker, disclosed that sales weakened markedly in August, and it lowered its earnings guidance for the rest of 2007. For Mr. Muhlenkamp, ''that was the first sign I'd seen that showed things might be slowing down.''
 In recent months, he says, it has been tough to read consumers, as the subprime mess shook the credit markets while broader indicators like the stock market and the unemployment rate held up well. Despite this summer's gyrations, the Dow is up about 11 percent for the year. ''If you look at the newspapers, you get one message, but if you look at stocks, you get another,'' he explains.
 The half-point rate cut by the Federal Reserve on Sept. 18 did buoy Wall Street, but it's not clear how much that will help consumers in the short term.
 Greg Badishkanian, a leisure analyst at Citi, follows both companies, and he agrees with Mr. Muhlenkamp that Harley-Davidson and Winnebago are distinctly fit to be considered canaries in the coal mine.
 Although many market watchers look at retailers like Target or Lowe's -- both of which, incidentally, cut their sales forecasts last week -- the fact is that consumers will continue to shop even if the economy slows dramatically; they will just buy less. The same goes for Starbucks, which sells what many analysts consider the kind of ''small luxury'' item that consumers refuse to give up even when they cut back on other purchases.
 After a flat performance in the last quarter of 2006, Harley's retail sales fell about 6 percent in the first half this year. And Mr. Badishkanian reports that recent checks with local Harley dealers indicate that motorcycle sales will be down even more sharply for the second half.
 Winnebago's sales numbers have also been anemic, with a further deterioration in the last six weeks. A typical recreational vehicle costs $60,000 to $100,000, so a Winnebago ''is the most discretionary of all the leisure vehicles,'' Mr. Badishkanian says. ''Whenever a consumer gets concerned about their own personal finances, these types of purchases are the first to go.''
 ''Consumers right now are very skittish,'' he adds. ''These numbers lead me to believe that consumer confidence is weaker than reflected in many published surveys.''
 Mr. Muhlenkamp, whose fund has small positions in both Harley-Davidson and Winnebago, says he does not expect a recession -- yet. But he does acknowledge that if current sales trends continue, the likelihood of a recession will increase.
 SHARES of both companies, meanwhile, are near 52-week lows, and Harley-Davidson -- known on Wall Street by its ticker symbol, HOG -- is down roughly 40 percent from its high late last year, to a current price of $46.21.
 Despite that drop, and Harley's low price-to-earnings multiple of roughly 13 times this year's profit, Mr. Badishkanian says bargain hunters should avoid its shares for now. It is a well-run company, he says, but even at the current level, Harley's share price doesn't reflect the potential earnings shortfall that a consumer-led recession could cause. ''A partial recovery is already priced into the stock,'' he says. ''But we're not seeing that.''
 As the crucial Christmas season approaches and other consumer-sensitive retailers come under scrutiny from recession-wary investors, the not-so-loud roar coming from Harley-Davidson and Winnebago bears close listening.

HEADLINE: Norway Gives More To Fight Ills Overseas

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER

 BODY:
Norway, whose 4.7 million people already contribute almost $4 billion a year to aid developing countries, will give $1 billion on top of that in the next 10 years to reduce deaths of millions of mothers and children from preventable causes, its prime minister, Jens Stoltenberg, announced last week at a Clinton Foundation conference in New York.
 Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende of the Netherlands pledged at the same news conference that his country would give $175 million for child and maternal health in the next three years. 
 As Norway and the Netherlands, two of the five most generous nations in aid to the developing world, raised their financial commitment in one conference room, Bill Frist, the former Republican senator who now works with Save the Children, stood up in another room at the conference to lead a panel on child and maternal health.
 Several influential groups, including Save the Children, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the rock star Bono's One Campaign, are pushing the United States, next to last among rich nations in aid to developing countries as a share of gross national product, to increase its giving to improve the survival odds of mothers and children. Financing from the United States to combat malaria and AIDS, killers of children in poor countries, has grown, but spending to fight many other childhood illnesses has stagnated.
 Mr. Stoltenberg first weighed in on child health in 2000 when his oil-rich nation made a $1 billion, 10-year commitment to the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization, which has since helped prevent the deaths of millions of children from measles and other diseases. 
 ''I am a father,'' he said in an interview on Wednesday. ''I see how important it is to give vaccines to my own children, and I see how unjust it is that many children do not receive this magic shot. And I am an economist. I see how cheap it is to save lives.''
 Norway's new $1 billion commitment will strengthen basic health systems that serve women and children, he said, noting that after mothers die their children often perish or become ill. Some 500,000 women die each year of pregnancy-related causes worldwide, about one each minute. In Norway, Mr. Stoltenberg said, only one in 30,000 women die in connection with childbirth, while it is one in seven in some of the poorest countries.
 Mr. Stoltenberg, who has made child and maternal health a personal cause for years, recruited other heads of state from Africa and Asia to campaign with him on the issue. The presidents of Tanzania, Mozambique and Indonesia joined him onstage Wednesday.
 The gathering was part of the Clinton Global Initiative, in which leaders of political, business and nonprofit organizations are brought together to address issues of global poverty and climate change. It is administered by the William J. Clinton Foundation, which was founded in 2002 by former President Bill Clinton. 
 Norway plans to spend much of the money in the early years through the World Bank to give individuals and hospitals incentives to improve the care of women and children, for example giving village health workers small bonuses for taking women to give birth in health centers that have skilled health workers on duty. 
 In India, Norway has financed a project in Rajasthan State that pays poor women from urban areas $20 and from rural areas $40 to give birth in a health facility. Those are sizable sums for the very poor, and help cover the cost of riding a bus, a motorbike or an ox cart to the hospital. Since the program began, the percentage of women giving birth in health facilities has soared, along with their chances of surviving the complications of childbirth, said Tore Godal, an adviser to Mr. Stoltenberg.
 When Mr. Clinton praised Mr. Stoltenberg on Wednesday before the 1,300 people attending the Clinton Global Initiative he said: ''A billion dollars will save the lives of two million children. These people have done a great thing today.''

HEADLINE: The New Affirmative Action

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
David Leonhardt is an economics columnist for The New York Times.

 BODY:
In another time, it wouldn't have been too hard to guess where Frances Harris would have ended up going to college. She has managed to do very well in very difficult circumstances, and she is African-American. Her high school, in the Oak Park neighborhood of Sacramento, was shut down as an irremediable failure the spring before her freshman year, then reopened months later as a charter school. Midway through high school, her father developed heart problems and became an irritable fixture around the home. She also discovered that he was not actually her biological father. That was a man named Leroy who, when her mother took Harris to see him, simply said his name was George and waited for her to leave. In Harris's senior year, her mother lost her job at a nursing home and the family filed for bankruptcy. 
 Harris somehow stayed focused on teenage life. She earned an A-minus average and she distinguished herself as a debater. Her basketball teammates sometimes teased her for using big words, but they also elected her co-captain. As she led me on a tour of her school and her neighborhood one day this summer, she introduced me around with an assured ease that most adults can't manage, even if her sentences are peppered with ''like,'' ''you know'' and ''Oh, my God.'' Her bedroom in the bungalow she shares with her parents is a masterpiece of teenage energy, the walls covered with her prom-queen tiara, her purple-and-white basketball jersey (No. 3) and photos of her friends. ''The hardest part of high school,'' she says, ''was to be smart and cool at the same time.'' She decided her dream college was the University of California, Los Angeles. 
 Ten or 20 years ago, Frances Harris almost certainly would have been admitted. Her excellent grades might not have even been necessary, because Berkeley and U.C.L.A. -- the jewels in the U.C. system -- accepted almost all of the African-Americans who met the basic application requirements. To an admissions officer, Harris would have seemed like gold: diversity and achievement, wrapped up in a single kid.
 But in the early 1990s, the elite campuses began to pull back from their aggressive affirmative-action policies, and in 1996, California voters passed the California Civil Rights Initiative, also known as Proposition 209. After that, race could no longer be a factor in government hiring or public-university admissions. The number of black students at both Berkeley and U.C.L.A. plummeted, and at U.C.L.A. the declines continued throughout the next decade. The reasons weren't entirely clear, but they seemed to include some combination of the admissions office taking Proposition 209 to heart and black students falling further behind in the academic arms race. (Harris, for instance, scored a 22 on the ACT test -- slightly above the national average and well below the U.C.L.A. average.) The changes on U.C.L.A.'s campus were hard to miss. In 1997, the freshman class included 221 black students; last fall it had only 100. In the region with easily the largest black population west of the Mississippi River, the top public university had a freshman class in which barely 1 in 50 students was black.
 A U.C.L.A. graduate named Peter Taylor, a 49-year-old managing director at Lehman Brothers in Los Angeles, remembers picking up The Los Angeles Times outside his house on a Saturday morning in June of last year and reading that piece of news. Taylor, who is black, is a third-generation native of the city and one of U.C.L.A.'s most active alumni. Within days of reading about the latest decline in the number of black students, he began a campaign to reverse it. At a reception to honor U.C.L.A.'s new acting chancellor, a law professor named Norm Abrams, he greeted Abrams with a big smile and said, ''Well, Norm, you're stepping right into it, and you've got to deal with it.'' Abrams soon named Taylor to lead a task force of students, faculty, alumni and outsiders from places like the Urban League and the First A.M.E. Church. It spent the next year trying to get more black students to apply, more black applicants to be admitted and more black admits to enroll. In essence, Taylor's group was trying to figure out how to bring a student like Frances Harris to U.C.L.A. without breaking the law -- or at least without getting caught. What they have achieved may well show us the future of affirmative action.
 Peter Taylor's office on the 25th floor of the MGM Building in Century City looks out over the Fox movie lot and a golf course; in the distance downtown Los Angeles rises. Taylor has lived in an artsy neighborhood of Los Angeles called Silver Lake since he was a child. In the aftermath of the Watts riots, his father, then a school administrator and one of the few black men to hold such a job, became the principal of Locke High School in South-Central Los Angeles. Taylor himself went on from U.C.L.A. to earn a master's degree in public policy and work for Bill Clinton's 1992 campaign before joining Lehman Brothers. When we were talking in his office, he apologetically interrupted our conversation and spent 10 minutes on the phone trying to persuade the person on the other end not to make any changes in a coming bond offering. There was, he kept saying, no point in doing something that might upset the market. But Taylor's cautious, corporate style can be deceiving. He doesn't mind a good fight. ''Prop. 209 has made things more challenging,'' he said. ''It has created a new paradigm. But there are still things that can be done.'' I asked him whether those things might include civil disobedience, and Taylor surprised me by replying: ''Exactly when you cross over into civil disobedience is not always clear. And I probably come down on the side of pushing the outer limits. I'm much more of the attitude of, 'So what if someone sues?' If you lose, you at least define the line a little more clearly. You say, 'Mea culpa,' and you don't do it anymore.''
 The heart of California's higher-education problem, according to Taylor, is that Proposition 209 created a patently impossible situation. The law says that universities can't consider race, even though race has an enormous effect on the lives of applicants. California's best high schools offer so many A.P. and honors classes -- which confer bonus points on a student's G.P.A. -- that the average G.P.A. of white and Asian freshmen at U.C.L.A. is now 4.2. At many of the largely black high schools around Los Angeles, it is sometimes impossible to do much better than a 4.0, because of the relative lack of A.P. classes. Black students at better high schools have a much easier time, but it's not as if they are keeping up with their peers. Even if U.C.L.A. tried to get around Proposition 209 by giving a big leg up to low-income applicants, it wouldn't increase its black population very much. At every rung of the socioeconomic ladder, the academic record of black students is worse than that of other groups. As Taylor says: ''There is a great deal of pressure to look for a proxy for race. There is no proxy for race.''
 He and many other defenders of affirmative action consider this to be a self-evident fact, but there has also been a good deal of social science to support the view that the specific problems surrounding race -- including discrimination -- endure. One illustrative study found that resumes with typically black names are less likely to lead to job interviews than those with typically white names. Other recent studies have looked at intelligence testing. There have long been two uncomfortable facts in this area: Intelligence, indisputably, is in part genetic; and every intelligence test shows a gap between black Americans and others. For a long time, scientific research wasn't very good at explaining this gap. But it has gotten better lately. For one thing, the gap between white and black adults has narrowed significantly since 1970, according to work by the noted researchers William Dickens and James Flynn. Four decades is too short a time period for the gene pool to change, but it's not too short for environment to improve. Most intriguing, Roland Fryer and Steven D. Levitt, two economists (the latter is one of this magazine's Freakonomics columnists), have found there to be essentially no gap between 1-year-old white and black children of the same socioeconomic status. 
 There are still vigorous debates about all this work -- intelligence tests of 1-year-olds are iffy, for instance -- but it points in one direction. Innate intelligence may be partly genetic, but it doesn't seem to vary by race. So while race may not be the only source of disadvantage in today's society, it is certainly one of them.
 Since affirmative action began in the mid-1960s, it has had both an explicit role and an implicit one in American life. Explicitly, it has been about race and, to a lesser degree, sex -- a policy to make up for centuries of oppression and to ensure diversity. But there has always been a broader notion to affirmative action as well. It has been the most serious effort of any kind to ensure equality of opportunity, without regard to wealth or poverty. When all else failed -- the War on Poverty, welfare, public schools -- affirmative action would be there to help less-fortunate Americans overcome the circumstances of their origins. ''Ability is not just the product of birth,'' Lyndon Johnson said when he effectively created affirmative action during a graduation speech at Howard University in 1965. ''Ability is stretched or stunted by the family that you live with and the neighborhood you live in -- by the school you go to and the poverty or the richness of your surroundings. It is the product of a hundred unseen forces playing upon the little infant, the child and, finally, the man.''
 The more expansive idea of affirmative action as a counterweight to those ''unseen forces'' has become tightly linked to the self-image of American universities. Above all else, they are supposed to be meritocracies. To be truly meritocratic, a college must be diverse -- or else accept that some groups in society have less merit than others and their underrepresentation can't be helped. University administrators clearly reject this second view, and as a result the best colleges are now filled with students of both sexes and every imaginable race and religion. If you were to ask admissions officers whether they also gave special consideration to low-income applicants -- whether they gave them credit for overcoming Johnson's unseen forces -- the officers would say that, absolutely, they did. 
 In truth, however, they did not. Three years ago, William Bowen (the former president of Princeton) and two other researchers discovered what was really going on. They persuaded 19 elite colleges -- including Harvard, Middlebury and Virginia -- to let them analyze their admissions records. The easiest way to understand the results is to imagine a group of students who each have the same SAT scores. Holding that equal, a recruited athlete was 30 percentage points more likely to be admitted than a nonathlete. A black, Latino or Native American student was 28 percentage points more likely to be admitted than a white or Asian student. A legacy received a 20-percentage-point boost over someone whose parents hadn't attended that college. And low-income students? They received no advantage whatsoever. A poor white kid from upstate New York would be treated no differently from a white kid in Chappaqua. Frances Harris would get no more of a leg up than the black daughter of corporate lawyers.
 Bowen says he doesn't believe that admissions deans were lying when they said that their affirmative-action programs took social class into account. The colleges apparently put even more stock in the polish that comes with affluence -- the well-edited essay, the summer trip to Guatemala, the Arabic language lessons. In any case, the poor lose.
 There are some big problems with this approach to affirmative action. For one thing, it rests on a very rickety base of political support. Colleges often resort to huge preferences to create a racially diverse student body, especially if they haven't been giving any advantage to low-income applicants, who are of course disproportionately minorities. And many of the beneficiaries of the preferences end up being upper-middle-class minority students, since they tend to have better test scores than poor minorities. The helping hand that goes to these relatively well-off nonwhite students strikes many people as unjust. It makes it seem as if affirmative action isn't making good on its larger promise. Affirmative action becomes about mere diversity -- and not even all forms of diversity -- rather than fairness. Politically, that has made it weaker and weaker. 
 In the mid-1990s, a businessman in California named Ward Connerly began making some of these very criticisms. Connerly was born in Louisiana in 1939; his father left the family, and his mother died when he was a little boy. So he was sent West to Sacramento to be raised by his grandmother. He eventually began working for the state government, where he became friends with Pete Wilson, a young Republican legislator. After Wilson was elected governor in 1990, he named Connerly to the University of California's board of regents, and Connerly began pressuring the university to cut back on race-based preferences. His efforts culminated in Proposition 209.
 Connerly, not least because he is black, was the politically perfect face of the anti-affirmative-action movement. He argued then, as he still does, that the patchwork of diverse campuses and workplaces created by affirmative action has deluded the country into thinking that it is solving its racial problems. In truth, he says, the policy has actually made it harder for blacks to close the achievement gap with whites. ''It's not genetic, I'm convinced,'' he told me this summer. ''So what is it? I think it's largely self-imposed by black people who don't put as much emphasis on academic achievement as they once did and as other groups do now.'' Connerly will tell you that he ended up going to college (at Sacramento State) because his grandmother pushed him to read books all the time. 
 Many people reject his argument as simplistic, if not worse. But whatever you think of his solution, it's hard not to find some truth in his critique of traditional affirmative action. Certainly, voters seem to feel this way. Last year, Michigan passed an initiative identical to Proposition 209, and, thanks to Connerly, several other states are likely to vote on such proposals next year. Soon, more universities may find themselves in the same situation as the University of California.
 There is almost an iron law of higher education: the more selective a school is, the fewer low-income students it has. At Harvard and Yale, only about 10 percent of undergraduates receive federal Pell Grants. (Typically, students from the bottom 40 percent of the income distribution are eligible for the Pell.) Even at top public universities, the share is often 15 percent or less. The colleges that are filled with poor and middle-class students almost invariably have low graduation rates. So their graduates are more likely to end up on the wrong side of the 21st century's educational divide. A bachelor's degree seems out of reach to a large portion of the American population, and, as a result, other countries have closed the gap in educational attainment with the United States over the last generation. 
 There are really only two exceptions to the rule, two universities that are both elite and economically diverse: U.C.L.A. and Berkeley. A chart on U.S. News & World Report's Web site does a nice job of summarizing just how unusual they are. It lists the percentage of Pell Grant recipients at each university in the magazine's famous Top 25 ranking. U.C.L.A. tops the list, at 37 percent, and Berkeley comes next, at 31 percent. In third place is Columbia, with just 15 percent.
 To be fair, the main explanation for this gap is demographic happenstance. California is filled with low-income immigrant families, especially from Asia and Latin America, with high-achieving children. But a set of deliberate policies also plays an important role. The University of California accepts far more transfer students, mainly from community colleges, than most colleges. At U.C.L.A., about one-third of the admitted students arrive as transfers instead of as freshmen. When I was on campus, I met a 27-year-old Mexican immigrant named Daniel Flores, who was admitted three years ago as a junior even though, as Flores told me, ''I barely graduated high school.'' His first job after high school was in one of U.C.L.A.'s dining halls, where he realized that he would need more education if he ever wanted to make much more than minimum wage. He then enrolled in a community college in West Los Angeles and excelled there. When he was 18 years old -- the only point in life when elite colleges usually consider candidates -- no sane admissions officer would have let him in. By the time he was 23, it was clear he had mainly just lacked for good opportunities. Earlier this year, he graduated from U.C.L.A.; and there are hundreds of other students with life stories not so different from Flores's who are walking through the Italianate buildings on the university's lush campus.
 If anything, Proposition 209 may have helped keep the U.C. campuses as economically diverse as they are. Desperate to maintain some racial diversity, university officials set up outreach programs in lower-income school districts, as James Traub described in this magazine several years ago. One of them, run by U.C. Davis, which is outside of Sacramento, visited Frances Harris's elementary school. It was around this time that Harris first told her parents that she planned to go to college. Over the years, when things got tough, they both made a point of reminding her of her vow. ''At times I got discouraged, and they said, 'You've said you're going to go to college, and you're going to go,' '' she recalled. A framed ''reservation for college'' certificate from the Davis program still hangs in her bedroom.
 After the initiative passed, the U.C. campuses also put more weight on students' socioeconomic backgrounds when they made admissions decisions. Richard Sander, a U.C.L.A. law professor who has become a critic of affirmative action, studied admissions data at Berkeley and found that, all else being equal, lower-income students had a better chance of getting in after 1997 than before. Together, these various class-based efforts have helped the share of Pell Grant students at both U.C.L.A. and Berkeley to hold steady over the last decade, even as it has declined at many similar colleges.
 You can make an argument, in fact, that the single most impressive university in the country today is U.C.L.A. It receives more freshman applications than any other -- 50,744 this year -- and, unlike many of its peers, it can legitimately claim to be an engine of opportunity. About 90 percent of its students, whether they enter as freshmen or transfers, eventually graduate. What City College of New York was to the 20th century, U.C.L.A. is to the 21st.
 And now, maybe, it is figuring out ways to solve its race problem.
 One night in march of this year, Peter Taylor and three other U.C.L.A. alumni met in his office to go over a big stack of U.C.L.A. applications from students who had already been admitted. Over sandwiches, the four of them -- none of whom was a university employee -- helped determine how much financial aid each student would get. This was one of the ''bureaucratic cover-me exercises,'' as Taylor puts it, at the heart of the new diversity push at U.C.L.A.
 In the previous few months, Taylor and his group had raised $1.7 million for scholarships, the plan being to offer virtually all of it, immediately, to admitted black students. The easiest thing to do would have been to hand over the money to the U.C.L.A. Foundation, which holds and invests the university's endowment, and then allow financial-aid officers to give it away as they saw fit. But U.C.L.A.'s general counsel said that allowing the foundation to handle funds specifically set aside for black students might violate the law. And letting the financial-aid office disburse the money almost certainly would have done so, since Proposition 209 prohibited colleges from recruiting students and offering scholarships based on race. But it didn't prevent student and alumni groups from doing so. In effect, Taylor and his task force began outsourcing work that normally would have been done by the university.
 Students and alumni stepped up their recruiting efforts. They visited high schools and set up a phone bank, with the help of a sympathetic alumnus who owned a call center, to reach out to black high-school seniors. Southwest Airlines donated plane tickets, helping black students who had been admitted to visit the campus. (A survey in 2005 had shown that admitted students were far more likely to choose U.C.L.A. if they had visited it. If you've been to the campus, this won't surprise you.) One program that greeted prospective black students, called Black by Popular Demand, was run by the African Student Union and the Black Alumni Association. Another program -- Scholars Days -- was aimed broadly at less-than-privileged students, and it was run by the university. The two were scheduled to overlap.
 This outsourcing was the second part of the task force's two-pronged strategy. The group also urged U.C.L.A.'s faculty senate last year to alter the admissions process. In the past, the admissions office divided every application between two readers: one evaluated a student's academic record, the other looked at extracurricular activities and ''life challenges.'' Berkeley, by contrast, had taken a more holistic approach, with a single reader judging an entire application, and Berkeley was attracting more black students than U.C.L.A. Why? Maybe the holistic approach takes better account of the subtle obstacles that black students face -- or maybe the readers, when looking at a full application, ended up practicing a little under-the-table affirmative action.
 Last fall, U.C.L.A. made the switch. Two applications readers I interviewed said that they had received clear, written instructions not to consider race and that they hadn't. (There are 150 readers in all, a mix of university employees and paid outsiders.) On the other hand, applicants seemed to understand that something had changed. Daniel Fogg, a computer programmer in the admissions office and an application reader, told me that he noticed more students mentioning race in their essays this year.
 Whatever the reasons, every phase of Taylor's campaign turned out to be a success. More than 2,400 black students applied last spring, up 13 percent from the previous year. Their admission rate rose to 16.2 percent, from 11.5 percent. Of those who were admitted, slightly more than half said yes, up from 41 percent in 2006. In all, about 200 African-American freshmen started classes last week, double the number the year before.
 One of them was Frances Harris. Back at her high school in Sacramento this spring, a group of seniors decided to celebrate their school's turnaround by photocopying their college acceptance letters and taping them to the walls. An entire hallway was filled with hundreds of letters. Until I stood in the hallway with Harris, I wasn't sure it was possible to find any part of today's college-application process inspiring. Eleven of the letters were hers, including ones from Pitzer College, Boston University, U.C.L.A. and U.C. Davis. (Berkeley rejected her.) She liked B.U., but it seemed too far away, especially from her mother's perspective. So Harris's decision came down to Pitzer, which offered her nearly a full scholarship, and U.C.L.A. In the end, a $1,000 scholarship from Taylor's group, a campus visit (flight courtesy of Southwest) and a phone call from U.C.L.A.'s director of financial aid -- a combination of official recruiting and outsourced recruiting -- pulled her toward U.C.L.A. ''The biggest thing was seeing so many beautiful, intellectual black young students, being cool and having discussions about calculus,'' she said. ''It was so pure. I was so impressed. It was amazing.''
 Harris's parents and her biological father all attended her high-school graduation. In late July, her parents drove her to Los Angeles so she could attend a six-week voluntary summer school that is officially open to incoming freshmen of all races but is dominated by black and Latino students. I saw Harris on campus in August, and she told me that she missed her friends from home but was happy to be a college student. On her first paper, in English composition, she got a B-plus, and on her second she got an A-minus. She's thinking about becoming a pre-med student. Next summer, she plans to go to Washington to work as an intern with the new chancellor of the school system there, Michelle Rhee, whom Harris met through her high school. 
 A few weeks after getting to U.C.L.A., Harris wrote an e-mail message to P. K. Diffenbaugh, one of her old teachers, telling him to send some of his current students to visit her soon, so they could get excited about college. ''In my comparative English class we read a book a week. It goes superfast so encourage your students not to fall off,'' she wrote. ''It's like the major leagues. . . . Academia!!!!''
 The big question that hangs over U.C.L.A.'s success, of course, is whether the university broke the law. Looking at the numbers, it's hard not to conclude that race was a factor in this year's admissions decisions. The average SAT score for admitted African-American students fell 45 points this year, to 1,738. For Asian, Latino and white students, the averages were much more stable. ''I'm quite confident that U.C. factors race in, in various ways,'' said Sander, the U.C.L.A. law professor and affirmative-action critic. ''There is no way to explain the disparities otherwise.'' He has filed a public-information request that would allow him to examine the data more closely. 
 In particular, U.C.L.A.'s experience suggests that some tension between race and class in the admissions process may be inevitable. Even as the number of low-income black freshmen soared this year, the overall number of low-income freshmen fell somewhat. The rise in low-income black students was accompanied by a fall in low-income Asian students -- not a decline in well-off students. U.C.L.A. administrators say they don't fully understand why.
 In a way, though, the question of whether race was a factor is itself misplaced. Proposition 209 forbids universities to consider race, but it doesn't stop them from considering disadvantage. So what if U.C.L.A. is somehow taking into account the disadvantages that black students face because of their race? Isn't that legal? And isn't it just? As Tom Lifka, a U.C.L.A. assistant vice chancellor who oversees admissions, said, ''It's the fallacy of 209 that you can immediately move to a system that doesn't take account of race and that treats everybody fairly.'' Lifka said he was confident that U.C.L.A.'s current system could withstand legal scrutiny.
 I asked these same questions about race and fairness of Connerly, who does favor preferences based on socioeconomic status (as do almost 85 percent of Americans, according to a 2005 New York Times poll). His first objection was constitutional: he believes the Supreme Court has given colleges very narrow instructions on when and how to consider race. Beyond that, he finds it hard to imagine that colleges would be able to strike the appropriate balance. ''I suppose you could craft some kind of system that says, 'We're going to acknowledge that there has been and continues to be discrimination in our society,' '' he said. ''But I believe it is almost impossible to decide on the acceptable range -- say, from 1 to 10 -- to take race into account.''
 He may well be right. But it sure seems worth the effort. Somewhat accidentally, U.C.L.A. appears to have gotten much closer to the ideal answer than most American universities. Unlike those of other elite colleges, its student body isn't dominated merely by the best and brightest of the upper middle class. U.C.L.A. has also figured out how to do a bit better by the standard diversity benchmarks than it had been doing. Despite all the political heat that still surrounds the issue in California, its universities seem to be pointing to a better version of affirmative action -- one that uses a little less race and a lot more class. ''What would be nice is if we could craft a social compromise that could keep the best of the program while admitting some of its flaws,'' says Sander, who supports the idea of affirmative action, despite his criticisms of the current system. ''It's way beyond, 'Mend it, don't end it.' Let's fundamentally restructure this and be much more aware of class. If we did that, we'd build a much bigger consensus and take a lot of wind out of the sails of Ward Connerly.'' Such a consensus might show us, finally, how to put the accomplishments of a student like Frances Harris into the right perspective.

HEADLINE: Reviving a Seaside Resort

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
LONG BRANCH
 FOR decades, this small city of 32,000 was one of the mysteries of the Jersey Shore.
 Long Branch, like its longtime rival Asbury Park, seemed impervious to the rising real estate market and the thirst for waterfront property that had revived virtually every other beach town, from Sandy Hook south to Cape May. A long stretch of Long Branch's oceanfront was a battered array of go-go joints, vacant storefronts, weedy lots, drug dealers, decrepit housing and a defunct water slide. Through the 1980s and 1990s, weekend beachgoers just headed farther south, avoiding the place altogether.
 But Long Branch is now hot, hot, hot. The boardwalk has been rebuilt, and the beaches have been replenished with sand. There are new condominium towers and town houses. The Ocean Place Resort and Spa just announced a $500 million expansion project, and the city has unveiled plans to rebuild the amusement pier that burned down in 1987. 
 And at the newly established Pier Village complex along Ocean Avenue, there are chic shops, apartments under gabled roofs, three elegant restaurants and a private beach club with palm trees where members recline while waiters fetch mojitos and crab cakes.
 Indeed, Travel and Leisure magazine placed Long Branch among the top 20 American beaches this summer, alongside Waianapanapa, the black-sand beach on the Hawaiian island Maui. New York magazine touted Long Branch as an ideal spot for Manhattanites to get a ''dose of sand and sea'' and still get home for dinner. New Jersey Bride magazine called it ''the shore's hippest spot for tying the knot.''
 One indicator of the city's comeback is its sale of 111,125 beach badges this past summer, nearly twice as many as last year, and 284 percent more than in 2000. And crowds are still expected to stroll the boardwalk this fall. 
 ''There's so much energy here,'' said Peter Visceglia, a developer from Red Bank who was enjoying the sun last month behind the thick rope that separates the beach club's 400-foot stretch of private oceanfront from the public. He and his wife, Michele, leased an apartment at Pier Village for summer and fall getaways. ''They really created something special.''
 The rejuvenation of what was once New Jersey's most important resort is not an overnight sensation. Adam Schneider, the mayor of Long Branch for the past 17 years, said that he and the city council started working on a master redevelopment plan in 1996. Still, the real estate boom in the 1990s left Long Branch pretty much untouched.
 But now, in addition to the beach-area development, work is beginning on creating a new arts district on Broadway, a dowdy commercial strip downtown.
 This does not mean that all the longtime residents are happy about the changes. Some property owners have protested and filed lawsuits over the city's use of eminent domain to seize their land to make way for development like the arts district or the next phases of Pier Village, which will expand to the west and the south. In a city where 16.7 percent of the people live below the poverty line, some residents wonder whether they will be pushed out just when Long Branch is on the mend. 
 In the late 1700s, Long Branch was one of the country's first resorts, attracting visitors from Philadelphia and New York to its boarding houses. A century later, Lillie Langtry, Diamond Jim Brady and Presidents Grant and Garfield made their way to Long Branch for the salt air, the big hotels and the gambling halls, and the horse racing at nearby Monmouth Park.
 Later, Long Branch was eclipsed by Asbury Park, a beach town a few miles south, though today Asbury Park is years behind Long Branch in its effort to redevelop its shorefront.
 By the 1960s, both cities were in decline. Unlike most beach towns, Long Branch and Asbury Park had thrived year-round with commercial centers and some industry, but jobs were leaving and summer tourists were heading elsewhere.
 Long Branch's nadir came in 1987 when a fire destroyed a fishing and amusement pier and a long section of boardwalk. For years, the swath sat as a forlorn symbol of decline.
 But with other shore towns largely built up, developers began giving Long Branch a second look. Two years ago, Applied Companies built the $100 million Pier Village on the site of the old pier and amusement park. The land was one of four areas in the city that had been marked for redevelopment. The company built 322 rental apartments in four-story buildings on Ocean Avenue. But unlike many condo towers, Pier Village also has a sense of place. On a recent weekend, hundreds of people streamed through the street-level shops and restaurants and along the boardwalk. The crowds are still out at 10 p.m. 
 ''You're talking about an area that you wouldn't walk through during the day, let alone the night,'' said Mayor Schneider. ''Now there are more social events and economic activity in the winter than we used to have during the entire summer.''
 Mr. Schneider and local developers say the key to the turnaround has been a stable political leadership and the city's decision to hire urban planners to create their own vision, rather than waiting for developers to tell the city what they wanted to build. The mayor said the city has also insisted that developers either set aside about 10 percent of the units they build at below-market rates for low- and moderate-income families, or contribute to a housing fund.
 Howard H. Woolley Jr., the city's business administrator, said that Applied Companies, the Pier Village developer, initially wanted to put up a more standard residential project. But the city insisted that the company stick to the master plan and build a mixed-use project that included shops, restaurants and a nightclub so that it would become an oceanfront destination.
 The company has now started the second phase of Pier Village, an additional 240 apartments, more shops and a 30-room hotel. ''We saw an opportunity to bring a new urbanism and panache to the shore,'' said David B. Barry, the company's president.

Who Am I, if Not Mom?
 To the Editor:
 Being another downsized mom, I read ''Nest Empty, a Downsized Mom Reflects'' (Sept. 23) with both tears and smiles. My baby (he's 6-foot-5) recently left for college. This is my second and last time around, as his sister is 21 and a senior. I, too, have been ''laid off'' and ''let go'' as a daily mom. 
 Being a business owner and having a busy life had truly not defined me. I was Mom, always there and loving my children with all my heart. Cooking, baking, attending their sports events, having their friends over often -- these were truly some of the events that made me most happy. I wanted only to freeze my children in time. However, they both grew up and became independent beautiful young adults; I helped give them wings. 
 As we were driving away after dropping my son off at his new school, I saw him smiling while speaking on his cellphone. He was going to be fine. Suddenly, I questioned my very being, my inner core. Who was I, if not Mom? 
 After feeling like a semi-zombie for one week, I'm now entering the land of finding myself again. My world is opening slowly, little by little. I'm starting to get a glimpse of a new world; life is all about change. My children's departure has also given me my own wings.

 Re ''Closer Eye on Campus Drinking'' (Sept. 23):
 There seems to be a common theme spreading across college campuses nationwide: accountability. This trend is preventing students from experiencing a complete education.
 There was a time when students were considered capable people. They were allowed to make their own decisions and learn from their own actions. When did personal accountability shift from the individual to the institutions that surround them? Protectionism is no longer just a term of economics; rather its principles have seeped into the process of educating America's youth.
 There comes a point when people must learn for themselves. Scaring students away from drinking for four years in college teaches them nothing about behaving responsibly when they reach legal age. College is more than just textbooks and exams. It is a time for the next generation to learn how to become responsible adults.

 Running Together: A Shared Experience
 To the Editor:
 ''Keeping Up With the Pack,'' your Sept. 23 article about running packs, talks about finding in runners a separate group of friends; running side by side breeds confidences and shared experience. 
 It's all very true. For over a year I saw a running acquaintance only in profile as we sweated through the miles and talked along the way. We finally decided to meet face to face over lunch, and have now been married 23 years.

 To the Editor:
 I was surprised to see the Connecticut section feature a large photo of runners from New Jersey. We do run in Connecticut, you know.

HOW STARBUCKS SAVED MY LIFE 
 A Son of Privilege Learns to Live Like Everyone Else. 
 By Michael Gates Gill. 
 265 pp. Gotham Books. $23. 
 Some critics will no doubt dismiss ''How Starbucks Saved My Life: A Son of Privilege Learns to Live Like Everyone Else'' as promotional pap masquerading as a memoir. This critic, though, views it as one of the most scathing indictments of the advertising business to appear in a long time. 
 That is, admittedly, an odd interpretation, since the book has very little to do with the advertising business. It is, as the title suggests, about Starbucks, where the author, an older gent named Michael Gates Gill, son of the New Yorker critic Brendan Gill, went to work in an entry-level job out of desperation. 
 He was desperate because he had lost his ''high powered'' advertising position at the J. Walter Thompson agency in New York. Which brings us to the scathing indictment: Gill, with the grating babe-in-the-woods persona he adopts in this book, would have us believe that top advertising executives like him have no idea that there are black people in the world and that some of them run small businesses; that every weekday thousands of people gather at places like Grand Central Terminal for a ritual known as rush hour; that an overwhelming majority of lives are lived in the service of train schedules and bill collectors. If the rest of Madison Avenue royalty is as clueless about the real world as Gill makes himself seem in this book, off with their heads. 
 Gill was a creative director (whatever that is) at the agency when, 25 years into his career, he was given the boot in what he portrays as a youth movement at the company. So far, so good; he gets a sympathy vote. But he celebrated his unemployment by impregnating a woman not his wife. Not so good; sympathy vote retracted. What's really galling, though, is that he tries to wring new-father pathos out of that situation: ''He opened his mouth and out came the beautiful sounds 'Da da.' Two simple, heartbreaking syllables. Thinking back to how I had missed such magical moments with my other children'' -- see, he worked such long hours at the advertising job that his four children by his wife never saw him -- ''caused a physical pain in my chest.'' Sorry, bub; no sale. The sensitive-dad ethos has been with us for decades now. The only way you could have missed the news that children are more important than work the first time around is if you chose to. 
 Anyway, with that setup, Gill wanders into a Starbucks ''hiring event'' and meets Crystal, who gives him a job in her store at 93rd and Broadway in Manhattan. Crystal is black and street, and Gill makes sure we know it; the poor fellow seems to think he's entitled to some kind of cred because he has actually met a black person and is working for her. ''It was all so bizarre and foreign,'' he writes, ''like Alice through the looking glass. Or Michael Gates Gill breaking through to another place and class to find it wasn't so scary after all.'' Michael Gates Gill, welcome to 1965. 
 From there the book lapses into a four-step: Gill staring in wonder as commuters commute or a co-worker shows him how to fill a mop bucket; Gill abjectly apologizing for ignoring the poor, the working class, his children, his own racism and classism for all those years; Gill praising Starbucks, the world's greatest company (it offers health insurance!); Gill dropping famous names from his past. None of it rings true; all of it feels manipulative. Could it be that Gill, having coasted on his family name for years, looked around for another set of coattails and saw one with a Starbucks logo? If so, the strategy seems to have worked. Tom Hanks, apparently like Gill not realizing that Starbucks is more punch line than hot brand these days, has already grabbed the movie rights.

HEADLINE: A Gathering of Neighbors

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE DOWNES

 BODY:
The forces of global mobility, poverty and economic change that have spread Latino immigration throughout the United States have bestowed this mixed blessing across the New York region, too; in Westchester as much as anywhere else. 
 The communities are different, but the contours of the phenomenon are strikingly consistent. Mount Kisco, where Latino immigrants now make up more than a quarter of the population, has grappled with exactly the same problems that have stirred wrenching debates in Brewster and Mamaroneck; in Danbury, Conn.; Farmingville on Long Island, in Hazleton, Pa., and all over New Jersey. 
 While Latino newcomers make local economies hum, they can also stoke resentment and fear; the daily morning free-for-all among Latino day laborers and contractors' trucks provokes the angry sense among many that the dysfunction in the federal immigration system has stubbornly taken root on decidedly non-federal sidewalks and streets. 
 Mount Kisco has faced all these challenges and more -- a police officer there, George Bubaris, was indicted recently on manslaughter charges in the death of a homeless Guatemalan, Rene Perez. But it also stands out in the assertively practical ways it has confronted the issue, developed solutions, defused tensions and brought neighbors together.
 That sense of resolute welcome was reinforced last Wednesday night. It happened in Pleasantville, where a packed house at the Jacob Burns Film Center watched an independent film, ''Amexicano,'' about a friendship between an Italian-American from Queens and a day laborer from Mexico, and stayed for a panel discussion organized by Neighbors Link, a nonprofit organization in Mount Kisco that runs a hiring site for day laborers and offers a wide array of educational and family programs for Latino immigrants. 
 The discussion enabled the executive director of Neighbors Link, Carola Otero Bracco, to contrast the film's depiction of day labor on the streets of Queens with the success of her organization, which has greatly reduced the ad-hoc entropy of the street bazaar and, amazingly, stopped instances of wage theft by shady employers, a chronic source of grief for day laborers. The remarks by Mount Kisco's Mayor, J. Michael Cindrich, showed him to be a believer in the municipal benefits of the hiring-site approach.
 The evening reached a transcendent moment when a Guatemalan immigrant, Santos Teo, told his story and answered questions. In halting English at first, and then with confident eloquence in Spanish, with translation by Ms. Bracco, Mr. Teo said that the life of a day laborer was hard, full of drudgery and fear, but not lacking in hope.
 Was it really worse in Guatemala? one audience member asked. Given that you make so little, and live without job security or health insurance, is America truly that much better?
 Mr. Teo spoke of the violence and hopelessness in his country, and of the ambition that propelled him across the border. The desire that drives you north, he explained, is not only to make money, to support your family, but also to make something of yourself. 
 And with that, it seemed, Mr. Teo broke through. Another barrier fell. An anonymous face became a story. The applause he received was warm and long.

HEADLINE: Worker Solidarity Doesn't Have to Stop at the Rio Grande

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE DOWNES

 BODY:
Comprehensive immigration reform was supposed to overcome the debate's dead-end disagreements -- It's amnesty! No, it's not! -- by tackling multiple problems at once. It failed, miserably, twice in two years. Congress tiptoed back to the battlefield this month with a modest attempt to legalize some immigrant children who go to college or serve in the military. That failed too. Federal agents, meanwhile, have been feverishly raiding immigrants' homes, taking parents away in the dead of night. The illegal population has not left the country yet, but it is terrified.
 And yet for all that, the country is still no closer to figuring out how to handle the stream of workers over its borders, or how to be a global fortress when it is already a global magnet. What we need is a better debate. 
 Jennifer Gordon, a professor at Fordham Law School who won a MacArthur award for her work with immigrant laborers, is offering one. In a recent article she presents a compelling way out of one of immigration's trickiest riddles: how to manage the immigrant flow in a way that is realistic, workable and fair to both newcomers and to native-born Americans. 
 Sealing them all out is impossible, throwing the border open unthinkable. Creating a permanent underclass of guest workers has a long, nasty history. 
 The challenge is to build institutions that conform to reality but lessen its ill effects. ''We can't revert to the fantasy that we can just turn the tap off,'' Professor Gordon said. ''We have to engage with the question, not abdicate the debate to restrictionists on the one hand and a corporate-designed guest worker program on the other.''
 In ''Transnational Labor Citizenship,'' published last spring in the Southern California Law Review, Professor Gordon offers a new way to structure labor migration. 
 Her proposal would link the right to immigrate not to a job offer from an employer but to membership in a cross-border worker organization -- a kind of transnational union. Migrants could work here legally, but only after agreeing not to undercut other workers by accepting substandard pay or job conditions. The organizations would enforce the agreement and protect members' rights here and in their home countries. 
 The goal, she says, is ''to bring up the bottom, not by shutting immigrants out, but by organizing them before they come.'' Workers who follow the rules would become ''transnational labor citizens'' -- supporting their families and the American economy while offering a powerful check on under-the-table exploitation. 
 Professor Gordon readily acknowledges the implausibility of winning that One Big Union on a continental scale. But persuasive precedents for her approach exist. The Farm Labor Organizing Committee, an agricultural workers' union, signed a contract in 2004 to protect thousands of Mexican guest workers in North Carolina. In 2005, it opened an office in Monterrey, Mexico, to further its organizing efforts and defend its members from abusive recruiters there. 
 Last year, the United Farm Workers and Global Horizons, one of the largest suppliers of agricultural guest workers, signed the first nationwide contract covering immigrants. It provides employer-paid medical care, a seniority system and a grievance procedure to ensure that employers comply with the law.
 Doubters will insist that it is crazy to expect immigrants to risk their meager paychecks to defend their rights and abstract notions of worker solidarity.
 But they have already shown that they will. Professor Gordon won her genius grant after creating the Workplace Project, an organization of Latino immigrants on Long Island that uses its members' collective power to regain withheld or stolen wages. Worker centers like it around the country are providing a surge of energy and optimism to the labor movement. Latino day laborers, organizing themselves at hiring corners around the country, are putting a floor on wages and thwarting abusive employers. 
 That's why John Sweeney, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., went to the annual convention of the National Day Laborers Organizing Network in Silver Spring, Md., in August and lauded their shared struggle. 
 The heart of Professor Gordon's proposal is the insight that we can enlist immigrants themselves in upholding the lawfulness and high standards we hold dear. An immigrant worker who is unafraid is better than one who is vulnerable and easily abused. 
 As she sees it, politicians who so bitterly oppose day-laborer hiring sites and other attempts to regularize the underground economy are unwittingly enabling the exploitation and lawlessness they profess to oppose. The ''transnational labor citizens'' Professor Gordon envisions, on the other hand, would uphold American working standards as they assert and defend their own.

HEADLINE: Where Water Turned Land Into Gold

BYLINE: By C. J. HUGHES

 BODY:
A SELF-CONTAINED section of the city of Norwalk, in south-central Fairfield County, Rowayton curves into Long Island Sound like a fishhook. Thus, views of the water are ample and varied: wind-ruffled harbors filled with sailboats, but also calmer grass-fringed coves.
 A more prosaic feature of the landscape, however, can sometimes distract from the views: speed bumps. Crockett Street is ribbed with a pair of them, and Old Trolley Way, on Rowayton's eastern edge, has three. There are also a few corrugating Roton Avenue, as it winds its way beachward. 
 Forcing vehicles to slow down has become a priority for the community, residents say, especially because large trucks traveling along Interstate 95 often detour through Rowayton to avoid highway tie-ups. In a neighborhood where parents and children frequently stroll the streets to buy stamps, launch kayaks or just enjoy the breeze, those rumbling rigs can pose a danger. 
 Soon, it appears, trucks seeking shortcuts will be facing speed bumps of another variety. On Aug. 21, the state's traffic commission banned trucks from cutting through Rowayton on Route 136 without specific reasons to be there. And about two weeks ago, six signs announcing the ban went up on the route between Darien and South Norwalk. Echoing others, Gaylen Nash, a resident with two young daughters, says she is relieved. ''This is a walking community,'' Ms. Nash said, ''and now that we don't have to navigate around big trucks, it's a much safer environment.'' 
 What encourages all the walking is Rowayton's surroundings. Its 1,450 homes and one-street commercial district are nestled onto a 1.4-square-mile peninsula. Walking encourages sociability -- at least, Ms. Nash says, she experiences Rowayton that way. The ease of interaction with neighbors was one big reason that she and her husband, Don, a New York television producer, moved there.
 Wilton, an inland town they also researched, felt too isolated, she said, and coming from the Upper East Side of Manhattan, where they had lived in a one-bedroom rental, ''we wanted to immerse ourselves in a community where we could meet other people.''
 That has been made even easier by the fact that her 1999 colonial, with four bedrooms, two and a half baths and 2,600 square feet of space, is part of the Rowayton Beach Association, a dues-paying enclave on the Five Mile River that has social events throughout the year. 
 In 2004 the house cost $1.1 million, Ms. Nash said, adding that based on nearby sales prices, it could sell for $1.6 million today.
 The Rowayton Civic Association, a larger donation-supported group, also organizes events like parades and swim races. And the River Cat Cafe has live music three nights a week. Before she dropped in, ''I thought, this will be so Connecticut,'' said Ms. Nash, who grew up in California. ''But it can actually get really jumping.''
 What You'll Find
 In its liveliness at least, Rowayton has changed little in six decades, said Shelley Trubowitz, who moved to the community in 1951. Back then actors, screenwriters and children's book authors from New York had weekend homes there, and the shipyards fueled the year-round economy. 
 Today, however, many of the low-slung, unheated cottages from that era have been razed and replaced by structures three times the size. This is especially true near the water, in Pine Point and Bell Island, two other homeowners' associations. 
 Mr. Trubowitz, a retired prosthodontist, now lives in a 1,200-square-foot one-bedroom apartment atop his former office, in a building overlooking the Five Mile River that used to be a boathouse. 
 The building, which has 2,600 square feet of total space, cost $55,000 in 1965. Since then, Mr. Trubowitz has built three town houses on the same property, for an additional 4,400 square feet. He estimates that the entire 7,000-square-foot parcel, which is zoned for businesses and homes, could sell for $4.5 million.
 ''Anything on the water here has just become gold,'' said Mr. Trubowitz, adding that he has owned seven properties in Rowayton over the years. 
 But with the interest in waterfront land has come controversy. The presence of newer homes, especially when they engulf their own and adjacent tiny lots, has angered some residents.
 In July 2006, acknowledging their concerns, Norwalk's zoning department reduced the allowable heights of houses in Rowayton's densely settled neighborhoods to 30 feet from 35 feet, measuring from the ground to the midpoint of the roof's slope. 
 Not all older homes have been razed, of course. In fact, Rowayton has more than 100 century-old homes, according to Lesley S. Korzennik, the co-president of the Rowayton Historical Society. 
 Typically found away from the water, along Highland Avenue, Logan Place and Rowayton Avenue North, behind privet hedges and under oak boughs, many of these antiques have fish-scale shingles on their gables and shallow wraparound porches. 
 As for condominiums, brokers say they make up only 4 percent of the housing stock -- despite high-profile developments like the 12-unit Harbor Bluff, looming over Bluff Avenue. 
 What You'll Pay
 In the third week of September, the average home price was $1.7 million, with 11 of the 57 houses on the market available for under $1 million, according to the Consolidated Multiple Listings Service, which serves Fairfield County.
 That average will buy a house renovated in the last decade that bears little resemblance to the 1920s Cape that once stood on its foundation, brokers said. It might have four bedrooms, three and a half baths, and 3,500 square feet of space -- or less space but possibly a glimpse of waves.
 In lock step with many other Fairfield County markets, Rowayton's has softened this year, and homes are sitting an average of 160 days, twice as long as in 2005, said William Axness, an associate with Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage.
 Still, prices have spiked 30 percent over the year-ago period; houses are regularly selling for 96 percent of asking price, Mr. Axness said. In comparison, he cited West Norwalk, where prices are down 23 percent. 
 ''We're an island in a sea of real estate confusion,'' Mr. Axness said. 
 Technically Norwalk's ''Sixth Taxing District,'' Rowayton pays for its own garbage pickup, streetlights, beach maintenance and fire department, though a portion of its taxes also supports city of Norwalk services like police and snowplowing. 
 Owing to those services, taxes can run about $23,000 on a three-bedroom with water views. For a similar home in Darien next door, they would be more like $13,000.
 Two of the three homeowners' associations -- which together account for about 20 percent of the housing stock -- require additional dues, about $400 a year, according to Barbara Gagliardi, a sales associate with Prudential Connecticut Realty. (Of the associations, Bell Island has voluntary dues.)
 What to Do
 If the River Cat Cafe is the meeting spot for adults, Brendan's 101 serves the same function for children, who devour burgers at outdoor tables under the protruding stern of a boat. Brendan's New England clam chowder, served with toasted bagel slices, costs $4.75. Photos inside depict the Roton Point Amusement Park, which starting in the 19th century drew New Yorkers via ferry. 
 The park closed during World War II, but vestiges remain at Rowayton's 10-acre public Bayley Beach, where the roller coaster's boarding gate is now a beachside pavilion.
 On a recent cool afternoon, a row of empty Adirondack chairs nearby faced the shore and, in the distance, Greens Ledge Lighthouse. By the water, a couple in visors and rubber boots cinched the lines on asailboat.
 The Schools
 The Rowayton School on Roton Avenue, which has 424 students enrolled this year, teaches kindergarten through Grade 5. The Roton Middle School, which has 423 students in Grades 6 through 8, has its own planetarium.
 Just outside Rowayton, Brien McMahon High School teaches 1,655 students on a campus that added 120,000 square feet in a 2006 renovation, including room for a culinary arts program and new science labs.
 Ninety-one percent of last year's graduating class went on to either two- or four-year colleges, according to Dawn Leeds, the chairwoman of McMahon's guidance department. On the SAT tests, the class's averages were 463 in reading, 456 in math and 465 in writing, versus 502, 504 and 503 statewide.
 The Commute
 Rowayton has a station on Metro-North Railroad's New Haven line, and during morning rush, trains run about every 20 minutes. The trip to Grand Central Terminal takes just over an hour. Monthly passes cost $264, slightly less if bought online.
 Commuter parking is trickier. The 319 spaces of permit parking have all been taken, said Barbara Dutton, the Sixth Taxing District's clerk, and 28 people are on a waiting list. 
 But Ms. Dutton was not completely discouraging, pointing out that 30 people did not renew their annual permits last June. Permits cost $315 a year, but if there are empty spots at the station, drivers can pay an attendant $5 a day to park there, she said. 
 The History
 A substantial piece of Rowayton was once owned by James A. Farrell, who in the early 20th century served as president of United States Steel and built an opulent Tudor-style castle, with parapets and leaded-glass windows, on steep land along Highland Avenue.
 Today Graham Capital Management, a financial services company, owns the building and its attached modern wing. Its slate-roofed carriage house, directly opposite, serves as Rowayton's community center and library, whose renovation is expected to be completed this year.

HEADLINE: Finding Renewal in a Waterfront Renaissance

BYLINE: By MARIALISA CALTA

 BODY:
IN 1974, when Art Cohn took a job as a commercial diver on the Burlington, Vt., waterfront, ''it was a no man's land: oil tanks, barbed wire everywhere, scrap yards and junk,'' he said. Now, as executive director of the Lake Champlain Maritime Museum, which is dedicated to the lake's maritime history, Mr. Cohn can stand on the deck of the museum's schooner and survey a waterfront teaming with cyclists, joggers, boaters and tourists. 
 ''It's a completely different place,'' he said. ''The transformation is extraordinary.''
 Burlington -- which, with about 39,000 residents, is Vermont's largest city -- is rediscovering an asset long hidden in plain sight: Lake Champlain, a waterway that transported people and merchandise and, said Mr. Cohn, brought the city into existence. The Lake Champlain Maritime Museum, which has its main campus south of Burlington in the city of Vergennes, keeps the Lois McClure -- a replica of a canal schooner -- on the Burlington waterfront, and maintains a small exhibit space there. 
 In the second half of the 19th century, Mr. Cohn said, the lumber business thrived, and waterfront acreage was created with fill ''just to have more land on which to pile more lumber.'' But by the 1930s and '40s, the waterfront had become primarily a storage place for oil tanks. Melinda Moulton, a local entrepreneur who bought land there in the early 1980s, remembers touring sites with a squirt gun in hand, to keep the rats at bay. Just three steep city blocks from the always-bustling Church Street Marketplace -- a pedestrian mall developed in 1981 and frequented by residents, visitors and students from the nearby University of Vermont -- the waterfront lay neglected. 
 That all began to change around 1988, when the Waterfront Revitalization Plan -- heavy on public use, environmental consciousness and careful private development -- was created. 
 Today, the waterfront exudes a cheerful, busy atmosphere. Well into the fall, Spandex-wearing cyclists on 24-speed carbon-fiber bikes share the 14-mile bike path along the lake with children still using training wheels, skateboarders, in-line skaters and joggers. Volleyballs and Frisbees sail through the air at the Waterfront Park. Toddlers experiment with water and other hands-on exhibits at the Echo Lake Aquarium and Science Center (Echo is an acronym for Ecology, Culture, History and Opportunities for stewardship). Diners share overstuffed crepes at the just-opened Skinny Pancake or, in season, a burger and a beer at the water's very edge, on the floating deck at the restaurant Splash. 
 Many of the amenities are seasonal, including public facilities on the city's three beaches, boat rentals, outdoor food vendors and tour boats, which open in the spring and close in mid-October. But it is year-round shops, residences and businesses that will keep the waterfront alive, said Ms. Moulton. In April, the Marriott Courtyard Burlington Harbor became the first new hotel to open in downtown Burlington in 30 years; it overlooks the lake from Battery Street, which runs parallel to the shoreline. Next door, a former Wyndham Hotel underwent $16 million worth of renovations and opened its doors last month as a Hilton. Just down the street, a former casual dining spot reopened in June with a Frenchified menu (escargots, coq au vin). As Quatorze Bistro, it rejoins the small number of established restaurants, delis and markets around Battery Street. 
 In 2005, Ms. Moulton and her business partner, Lisa Steele, opened the Lake & College Building, a 119,000-square-foot brick and stone structure that earned a silver LEED certification (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design); it offers 30,000 square feet of public space. In addition to the Skinny Pancake and offices, the building houses a movie theater and a performing arts theater. All are open year round, as are Echo and the nearby Taste of Burlington restaurant. 
 Rick Benson, the chef who opened Taste nearly three years ago in an 1850s-era, brick-and-timber mill building on a street paralleling the bike path, said that business doubled from the first to the second year of operation. Customers may come for a soup made with local beets and white truffle oil or a plate of duck with sour cherry sauce.
 The city's future revitalization plans may include an outdoor skating rink, a public market and public transit by rail and water. Currently, public transportation to the waterfront is limited but handy: a free bus with a route that shuttles from the lake to the Church Street Marketplace and on to the University of Vermont. 
 With all of the biking and jogging and dining going on, it is sometimes easy to forget that there is an entire lake out there -- 120 miles long and 12 miles wide -- waiting to be explored. 
 Those who don't own boats can, in season, rent them; aside from the small sailboats and kayaks rented at the Community Sailing Center (www.communitysailingcenter.org), several small-boat rental locations dot the lake shore. The 400-passenger Spirit of Ethan Allen III (www.soea.com) offers daily cruises and, in spring of 2008, a newcomer, the Moonlight Lady (www.vermontmoonlightlady.com), will offer two-to-seven-day cruises, the first ship to do so since 1952, according to its owner Mike Shea. 
 The Lake Champlain Transportation Company (www.ferries.com) operates ferries to the New York side of the lake and back year-round, but the boat running between Burlington and Port Kent, N.Y., stops running in October. 
 Scuba divers can, in season, explore shipwrecks, marked with buoys that are part of the Lake Champlain Underwater Historic Preserve. The maritime museum has teamed with a local operator to offer shipwreck tours via a remotely operated vehicle (R.O.V.) from a boat on the lake's surface, one of only three commercially operated R.O.V. tours in the world, according to Rachael Miller, co-owner of Lake Champlain Shipwrecks (www.shipwrecktour.com). 
 Visitors can expect waterfront activity to increase dramatically by 2009, when Vermont -- along with the state of New York and the province of Quebec -- commemorate the 400th anniversary of Samuel de Champlain's first visit to the region.
 Mr. Cohn says the city's ''waterfront renaissance'' enriches both citizens and visitors. ''When you discover your waterfront, you discover more than views. You discover your history,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Jena, O. J. and the Jailing of Black America

BYLINE: By ORLANDO PATTERSON. 
Orlando Patterson is a professor of sociology at Harvard and the author of ''The Ordeal of Integration: Progress and Resentment in America's 'Racial' Crisis.''

 BODY:
Cambridge, Mass.
 THE miscarriage of justice at Jena, La. -- where five black high school students arrested for beating a white student were charged with attempted murder -- and the resulting protest march tempts us to the view, expressed by several of the marchers, that not much has changed in traditional American racial relations. However, a remarkable series of high-profile incidents occurring elsewhere in the nation at about the same time, as well as the underlying reason for the demonstrations themselves, make it clear that the Jena case is hardly a throwback to the 1960s, but instead speaks to issues that are very much of our times.
 What exactly attracted thousands of demonstrators to the small Louisiana town? While for some it was a simple case of righting a grievous local injustice, and for others an opportunity to relive the civil rights era, for most the real motive was a long overdue cry of outrage at the use of the prison system as a means of controlling young black men. 
 America has more than two million citizens behind bars, the highest absolute and per capita rate of incarceration in the world. Black Americans, a mere 13 percent of the population, constitute half of this country's prisoners. A tenth of all black men between ages 20 and 35 are in jail or prison; blacks are incarcerated at over eight times the white rate.
 The effect on black communities is catastrophic: one in three male African-Americans in their 30s now has a prison record, as do nearly two-thirds of all black male high school dropouts. These numbers and rates are incomparably greater than anything achieved at the height of the Jim Crow era. What's odd is how long it has taken the African-American community to address in a forceful and thoughtful way this racially biased and utterly counterproductive situation.
 How, after decades of undeniable racial progress, did we end up with this virtual gulag of racial incarceration? 
 Part of the answer is a law enforcement system that unfairly focuses on drug offenses and other crimes more likely to be committed by blacks, combined with draconian mandatory sentencing and an absurdly counterproductive retreat from rehabilitation as an integral method of dealing with offenders. An unrealistic fear of crime that is fed in part by politicians and the press, a tendency to emphasize punitive measures and old-fashioned racism are all at play here.
 But there is another equally important cause: the simple fact that young black men commit a disproportionate number of crimes, especially violent crimes, which cannot be attributed to judicial bias, racism or economic hardships. The rate at which blacks commit homicides is seven times that of whites.
 Why is this? Several incidents serendipitously occurring at around the same time as the march on Jena hint loudly at a possible answer.
 In New York City, the tabloids published sensational details of the bias suit brought by a black former executive for the Knicks, Anucha Browne Sanders, who claims that she was frequently called a ''bitch'' and a ''ho'' by the Knicks coach and president, Isiah Thomas. In a video deposition, Thomas said that while it is always wrong for a white man to verbally abuse a black woman in such terms, it was ''not as much ... I'm sorry to say'' for a black man to do so. 
 Across the nation, religious African-Americans were shocked that the evangelical minister Juanita Bynum, an enormously popular source of inspiration for churchgoing black women, said she was brutally beaten in a parking lot by her estranged husband, Bishop Thomas Weeks. 
 O. J. Simpson, the malevolent central player in an iconic moment in the nation's recent black-white (as well as male-female) relations, reappeared on the scene, charged with attempted burglary, kidnapping and felonious assault in Las Vegas, in what he claimed was merely an attempt to recover stolen memorabilia. 
 These events all point to something that has been swept under the rug for too long in black America: the crisis in relations between men and women of all classes and, as a result, the catastrophic state of black family life, especially among the poor. Isiah Thomas's outrageous double standard shocked many blacks in New York only because he had the nerve to say out loud what is a fact of life for too many black women who must daily confront indignity and abuse in hip-hop misogyny and everyday conversation. 
 What is done with words is merely the verbal end of a continuum of abuse that too often ends with beatings and spousal homicide. Black relationships and families fail at high rates because women increasingly refuse to put up with this abuse. The resulting absence of fathers -- some 70 percent of black babies are born to single mothers -- is undoubtedly a major cause of youth delinquency. 
 The circumstances that far too many African-Americans face -- the lack of paternal support and discipline; the requirement that single mothers work regardless of the effect on their children's care; the hypocritical refusal of conservative politicians to put their money where their mouths are on family values; the recourse by male youths to gangs as parental substitutes; the ghetto-fabulous culture of the streets; the lack of skills among black men for the jobs and pay they want; the hypersegregation of blacks into impoverished inner-city neighborhoods -- all interact perversely with the prison system that simply makes hardened criminals of nonviolent drug offenders and spits out angry men who are unemployable, unreformable and unmarriageable, closing the vicious circle.
 Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton and other leaders of the Jena demonstration who view events there, and the racial horror of our prisons, as solely the result of white racism are living not just in the past but in a state of denial. Even after removing racial bias in our judicial and prison system -- as we should and must do -- disproportionate numbers of young black men will continue to be incarcerated.
 Until we view this social calamity in its entirety -- by also acknowledging the central role of unstable relations among the sexes and within poor families, by placing a far higher priority on moral and social reform within troubled black communities, and by greatly expanding social services for infants and children -- it will persist.

My Fellow Runners, My Intimates
 To the Editor:
 Re ''Keeping Up With the Pack'' (Sept. 23):
 Hurrah for running groups! I moved from Princeton, N.J., to Long Island last year, and I kept in touch with my running partners by phone and e-mail. But it was the minutiae of our daily lives that I missed most. 
 Athletic camaraderie is truly special. No one knows me better than my running friends.

 Campus Drinking and Responsibility
 To the Editor: 
 Re ''Closer Eye on Campus Drinking'' (Sept. 23): 
 Isn't it ironic that college admissions officers seemingly never mention education programs or policies to combat binge drinking, yet proudly show off the ''blue light'' used to report a suspicious incident and the text-message alert notification system to warn of a terrorist attack? 
 As twins who are high school seniors, we acknowledge the prevalence of irresponsible drinking by students. We are interested in how our prospective colleges address this equally dangerous and even more probable occurrence.
 Daniel Schneider-Weiler Joshua Schneider-Weiler Port Washington
 To the Editor:
 There seems to be a common theme spreading across college campuses nationwide: accountability. This trend is preventing students from experiencing a complete education.
 There was a time when students were considered capable people. They were allowed to make their own decisions and learn from their own actions. When did personal accountability shift from the individual to the institutions that surround them? Protectionism is no longer just a term of economics; rather its principles have seeped into the process of educating America's youth.
 There comes a point when people must learn for themselves. Scaring students away from drinking for four years in college teaches them nothing about behaving responsibly when they reach legal age. College is more than just textbooks and exams. It is a time for the next generation to learn how to become responsible adults.
 Zachary Rothberg Highland Park, Ill.
 Property Rights and the Common Good
 To the Editor:
 Re ''Court May Have Last Say in Mall Fight'' (Sept. 23): 
 Oyster Bay's supervisor, John Venditto, and the Town of Oyster Bay have turned the role of government on its head. Instead of protecting Taubman Centers' right to develop its property and preserving a free real estate market, town government has overreached its legitimate authority and surrendered to mob rule.
 Justice Jeffrey A. Spinner of State Supreme Court in Riverhead must exert New York State's proper role as both the protector of property rights and overseer of town authority and instruct the Town of Oyster Bay to issue a permit for an 860,000-square-foot mall, thereby sending a clear message to all towns and villages that property rights will be respected in New York State.
 State government must keep local government power in check, so as to protect individual property rights, preserve a market economy and not place local self-interests above the common good.

HEADLINE: It's Only a Game, But It's Played at Work

BYLINE: By MATT VILLANO. 
E-mail: ccouch@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Q.You have noticed several of your colleagues playing online games at work. Does this mean they are slacking off?
 A. Not necessarily. Kathleen Hall, chief executive of the Stress Institute, a research organization in Atlanta, said that just as some employees might gather at the water cooler for periodic breaks, other employees may engage in brief online game sessions as a way to recharge.
 ''We all love rewards,'' Ms. Hall said. ''Knowing you can play a game for 10 minutes if you accomplish certain tasks is a great way to motivate and get things done.'' 
 Q. How many people are playing online games at work?
 A. A 2006 study by Forrester Research estimated that 4 of every 10 adults in North America played online games. This summer, a survey of more than 7,000 randomly selected people by PopCap Games, a game developer in Seattle, indicated that 24 percent of respondents said they played such games at work.
 Jim Greer, founder and chief executive of Kongregate, an online game company in San Francisco, said its statistics indicate that peak game times are in the middle of the workday. Mr. Greer said that the site topped out at 800,000 users around 1 p.m. each day, and added that the site registers a significant drop-off in traffic after 5 p.m. Eastern time. ''We don't know for certain that all of those people are at work, but most people work between the hours of 9 a.m. and 5 p.m.,'' he said. ''You do the math.''
 Q. Why have workplace games become so common?
 A. Easy access, for one. Many Windows-based computers come standard with solitaire games like FreeCell. The Internet offers hundreds of other choices -- from Sudoku to no-stakes poker to role-playing games like World of Warcraft, and many of these are free.
 Online games in the workplace also seem to be driven by an influx of younger workers. Ken Kerr, chief executive of Kettley Publishing, a software company in Newport Beach, Calif., said that because many twenty-somethings grew up around Nintendo GameCubes or Sony PlayStations, they were more likely to play games as a diversion at work.
 ''Games are the norm for Generation X and Generation Y,'' Mr. Kerr said. ''Today, this is the way they live.''
 Q. How have businesses responded to the trend?
 A. Some companies forbid game-playing. Others have not taken a firm stance or have decided to allow some games but not others, using Internet filters to block access to some sites.
 Simeon Spearman, an analyst at Social Technologies, a consulting firm in Washington, said a handful of companies had embraced the trend by setting up separate game areas.
 Mr. Spearman cited Critical Mass, an interactive services firm in Calgary, Alberta, as one company that has established an entire room devoted to gaming. He said that other businesses, including Google and the Washington law firm Banner & Witcoff, have recently done the same.
 ''It's the modern-day spin on the ordinary break room,'' Mr. Spearman said. ''The idea is to develop a place where employees can interact with their co-workers, compete and have a short little spurt of excitement during the workday.''
 Q.What are the drawbacks of these games at work?
 A. For people with certain types of obsessive personalities, games can become addictive. For others, abusing the privilege of playing online games at work could start a pattern of procrastination or a recurrent struggle to concentrate and fulfill day-to-day responsibilities.
 Alan Allard, president of Genius Dynamics, a training and development company in Lawrenceville, Ga., said excessive game-playing could also hurt a worker's reputation, particularly among colleagues who refrained from games.
 ''There will be people observing every move you make,'' he said. ''No matter what the reality might be, playing games online at work will be perceived by others as neglecting work and not being engaged.''
 In some cases, particularly when users must download software to play, games can wreak havoc on a corporate network, sapping bandwidth and slowing overall performance considerably.
 Q. In general, how much game-playing at work is too much?
 A. That depends on the employee. For salaried workers who put in 12-hour days, it may be perfectly acceptable to take three or four breaks to stay sharp. For hourly employees, however, spending more than 10 or 15 minutes playing games at work might constitute underperformance.
 John C. Beck, co-author of ''The Kids Are Alright: How the Gamer Generation Is Changing the Workplace'' (Harvard Business School, 2006), says that when it comes to workplace games, moderation is important.
 ''What might be too much for one employee may be just the right amount for someone else,'' said Mr. Beck, who also is president of Northstar Leadership Group, a management consulting firm in Phoenix. As long as employees can get their work done and do not break office rules, he said, ''I don't see much harm in it every now and again.''

HEADLINE: Neglecting Tourism

 BODY:
Tourism contributes more than $9 billion to Connecticut's economy every year. Despite this, it is an industry that the state treats with disdain, even neglect. Leadership at the state level is minimal. This leaves things up to local governments, which have done a lot. Two examples: 
 Every year in October, New Haven holds three Open Studios weekends, when hundreds of artists open their studios to the public. Each weekend typically attracts 10,000 visitors and results in invaluable exposure -- and sales -- for artists who often labor in obscurity. 
 By the end of fall, as many as seven cruise ships will have stopped in New London, with each visit bringing up to 4,000 passengers and crew members who shop and view attractions from Mystic to Essex. Each visit leaves as much as $1.5 million in its wake. 
 These events have come about largely in spite of, not as the result of, state leadership. Gov. M. Jodi Rell has not yet bothered to appoint anyone to head the Commission on Culture and Tourism, a post that has been vacant since January. And budgets for local efforts have been reduced, not increased, in recent years.
 In 2003, the General Assembly streamlined area tourism districts in Connecticut, taking the necessary step to reduce their number from 11 to 5. But at the same time that the size of each district doubled, the governor and the Legislature cut their budgets in half, giving them a grant of about $900,000 each and ending the practice of awarding districts a portion of the hotel tax. Since then, the Commission on Culture and Tourism budget has also dropped by 30 percent. 
 The upshot? A drop in the number of visitors to the state's major attractions since 2003. The main reason the state is collecting more money from the hotel occupancy tax is higher prices -- not higher occupancy rates. 
 The lack of state support has forced locals with something to offer to rely largely on volunteers and their own ingenuity to get the word out. 
 New London welcomed one of the biggest cruise ships in America last month, Explorer of the Seas, but received little financial help from the state in mobilizing a small army of buses and drivers to transport passengers around the area. In Stamford, the Parade Spectacular held on the Sunday before Thanksgiving is becoming a major event, but promotion of the increasingly popular parade falls almost entirely on local shoulders. 
 So it is no surprise that Connecticut now ranks 40th of 50 states in the amount of money government invests in tourism. If Connecticut increased its state and regional spending just to 2002 levels -- about $18 million -- the state would probably more than make up for that money by increasing the number of visitors. In any event, the state cannot continue its policy of turning its back on the tourism industry and expect that the tourists, sooner or later, will not take notice.

HEADLINE: Is It Responsible to Shun Military Contractors?

BYLINE: By BEN STEIN. 
Ben Stein is a lawyer, writer, actor and economist. E-mail: ebiz@nytimes.com

 BODY:
HENRY BLODGET should have started out as a writer. In a way, he did. He wrote many praising analyses of high-tech and Internet companies for Merrill Lynch investors. But he also wrote e-mail messages to associates trashing companies he was recommending. Eventually, in a settlement, he agreed to pay a fine and was banished from the lush world of securities trading. 
 Mr. Blodget has now written an article about socially responsible investing, in the current issue of Atlantic magazine. It is a fascinating look at the topic -- and a fine primer in how markets work generally. 
 One little item in the article, though, struck me like a needle in the eye. Mr. Blodget said, and I should have known, that some socially responsible investors shun companies that do military contracting.
 What can this mean? I had always understood that socially responsible investment firms and advisers wanted a better planet and more dignity for humans and animals. We are currently in a war that is about creating a better, more dignified planet and we are fighting enemies who openly say they want to kill everyone who is not their slavish follower.
 Do socially responsible investors think they are doing something good by trying to make outcasts of military contractors, the very companies that help arm the people battling our foes? How can this be sensible?
 Would it have been sensible to work against the people making weapons to defend America in World War II? Aren't the people we are fighting now at least as dangerous?
 I don't understand this whole attitude. Maybe someone can explain it to me. I certainly believe in socially responsible investing for myself. I sold my tobacco shares long ago. (They have done fantastically well since then, but I don't regret my decision.) But to demonize the people making the weapons that our forces need to defend America? That is a total mystery to me. It sort of reminds me of the admonition that, ''When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child; but when I became a man, I put away childish things.'' Again, maybe someone can explain it to me.
 And while we are on the subject of corporations and morality, here is another thought: I was on a panel recently with a famous man who said he believed that the United States was in Iraq because it wants to be near its oil supplies to protect them. His point was provocative. 
 But what occurs to me is that, in fact, we get the largest chunk of our oil from the Western Hemisphere (from the United States, Canada, Mexico and Venezuela). We get a lot from African sources (particularly Nigeria). Only about 20 percent of our oil comes from the Middle East. A great slice of what we get from outside 0f the hemisphere is from countries where we have no military forces. 
 Who arranges for us to get that juicy oil from those faraway places? 
 Why, the oil companies, that's who. The oil companies we spend so much time hating and mocking and regulating. Just with their own cleverness and diplomacy and money, they get that black gold that powers our cars and cools our houses. It's just business for the oil companies. 
 Do they get any thanks? Yes. Thanks from little me. The staggering prosperity of this country, of the whole developed world, floats on oil. Let's have some respect for the people who get it for us without any loss of American blood.
 One more little thought about social responsibility: I read that my pals at Goldman Sachs have started an in-house stock exchange for trading unregistered securities. Goldman's exchange is restricted to institutional investors like pension funds and hedge funds with a lot of money under management. It is supposed to be relatively free of oversight by the Securities and Exchange Commission because of the sizable nature of its investors and traders. Now some of Goldman's competitors have started similar exchanges.
 I don't get it. The large institutional players are often just aggregations of many small investors. Why should they be denied the benefits of all the S.E.C. regulations about registration and full disclosure? Why is an investor less worthy of protection as a participant in a pension fund than as an individual? 
 And, anyway, the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 were passed to codify the basic fiduciary duties that trustees have in relation to their trustors -- such things as full disclosure and absence of fraud. 
 Why would the fact that the players in the Goldman market are large players make them any less worthy of being protected by those laws? And if that's true, then why not have the full panoply of S.E.C. protections in place, even at an in-house exchange?
 I well realize that the securities laws have long provided for different treatment of large and small investors. I am not saying Goldman or its competitors are doing something illegal. I am suggesting that maybe, when so many very large investors are aggregations of small investors, we might ask for a better balancing of protections. The ladder of law should have no top and no bottom.

HEADLINE: Blacks Mull Call for 10,000 to Curb Violence

BYLINE: By JON HURDLE

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, Sept. 29 

 BODY:
The men on the corner of 16th and Page in North Philadelphia say they know what their neighborhood needs to stem the violence that has killed 306 people citywide so far this year, and that does not include putting 10,000 men on the street, as some black community leaders have proposed.
 Amid the weed-strewn lots and boarded-up buildings of North Philadelphia, one of the city's toughest neighborhoods, the six men who gathered to talk, drink and play cards say the young people who pull guns and deal drugs need jobs, recreation centers, after-school programs and, most of all, parents who care for them. 
 ''It's just going to be useless,'' said one, Robert Mosley Jr., 42. ''As soon as those 10,000 guys go home, the drug dealers are going back out there, doing the same thing.''
 But others supported the initiative, saying it might help them feel better about coming out of their homes at night or allowing their children to play outside.
 ''It does make a lot of sense,'' said Cora Crawford, a 36-year-old single mother of five who lives on nearby Susquehanna Avenue. ''Kids in this area are horrible. They need a positive role model in their life.''
 The plan to put 10,000 men on the streets for an initial period of 90 days starting late this year is the latest effort by Philadelphia's black community to curb violence that drove homicides to a nine-year high of 406 in 2006.
 Groups of volunteers will be stationed on drug corners and other trouble spots in a bid to stop the shootings and other crimes that have given Philadelphia the highest homicide rate among the nation's 10 largest cities. They will not be armed, will not have powers of arrest, and will be identified only by armbands or hats during their three-hour shifts.
 They will be trained in conflict resolution, and are intended to be peacekeepers and mentors rather than law enforcers. Each patrol, however, will include a police officer.
 Organizers, including Police Commissioner Sylvester Johnson and the music producer Kenny Gamble, say they are open to volunteers of any ethnicity but are appealing mostly to African-Americans because some 85 percent of Philadelphia's shooting victims are black.
 Commissioner Johnson, who is black, said the initiative differed from previous antiviolence campaigns in that it was driven by popular demand, rather than by the Police Department or the city government.
 ''I have never been involved in an initiative of this size coming from the street,'' he said in an interview.
 Critics say the plan will fail to meet its recruitment goals, partly because it is too closely identified with the police, who will be responsible for selecting the areas to patrol and who are distrusted in many neighborhoods.
 Archye Leacock, executive director of the Institute for the Development of African-American Youth, a Philadelphia nonprofit group, said the police were overburdened by trying to control the toughest areas and so would be unable to respond adequately to alerts from the volunteers.
 Mr. Leacock also questioned whether the plan would motivate a generation of people who have learned to live with crime and violence. 
 But Bilal Qayyum, a co-founder of the antiviolence group Men United for a Better Philadelphia and a member of the organizing committee, described the response since the plan was announced Sept. 10 as ''tremendous.'' He predicted more than 10,000 volunteers would come forward when it starts on Oct. 21.
 Mr. Qayyum conceded that the plan did not address underlying problems like unemployment, poverty, poor education and the easy availability of guns. Drug dealers will probably just move to the next block to avoid the new volunteers, he said.
 But he said that getting men to take responsibility for their own communities was a step in the right direction. ''That begins to address the core problem,'' he said.
 Near 16th and Page, Tyrone Dodson, 60, expressed hope that the plan would work. Like several others, Mr. Dodson said he planned to sign up because he believed it would deter the shootings outside his apartment almost every night.
 ''It would stop them,'' he said. ''They don't want no witnesses.''

HEADLINE: Urging Inclusion in a Changing City

BYLINE: By LISA PREVOST

 BODY:
BRIDGEPORT
 THIS long-suffering city, the state's most populous and one of its poorest, is becoming the darling of developers. Three major mixed-use developments with the potential to transform neighborhoods and stabilize what is the highest property-tax rate in Fairfield County are moving forward at once. 
 City officials express hope that gleaming residential towers on the skyline and posh restaurants along the waterfront will signal a rebirth in Bridgeport. 
 Some community advocates, on the other hand, express concern: If most of the 4,000-odd apartments in the pipeline are designed to attract more middle- to upper-income residents, any accompanying rise in property values could gradually drive out existing residents. 
 ''There's a growing recognition across the city neighborhoods that we're increasingly squeezing the folks who live here,'' said Marilyn Ondrasik, executive director of the Bridgeport Child Advocacy Coalition, a group of 80 community organizations for disadvantaged children. 
 Though the city's housing prices and rents are considerably lower than those in the county's suburbs, its stock of low-cost units is declining. According to a city-commissioned study of housing in 2000 to 2005, Bridgeport lost about half its apartments renting for under $750 a month. 
 A housing policy proposed for Bridgeport's new master plan (which is still under review) recommends an ''inclusionary zoning'' policy that would require developers to set aside 10 percent of units as affordable housing. Such a policy has been in place for several years in Stamford; developers may build the units on site or elsewhere in the city, or may instead make a cash contribution to an affordable-housing fund. 
 Mayor John M. Fabrizi of Bridgeport has had an informal inclusionary policy when working with developers seeking city-owned property or tax concessions, said Nancy L. Hadley, director of economic development. 
 The proposed $222 million redevelopment of a city-owned site downtown near the Harbor Yard arena will include 40 units of so-called work-force housing among its 300 rental and sale units, and 50 units of public housing, Ms. Hadley said. (More than 250 public housing units were demolished there in 2002.) 
 But the city's definition of affordability is at issue. An agreement negotiated by the administration for a second project -- the $1.5 billion redevelopment of the city-owned Steel Point peninsula -- has drawn sharp criticism from some community groups and some City Council members. 
 The developer, Midtown Equities of New York, wants to build about 3,500 housing units facing Bridgeport Harbor, along with shops, restaurants, a waterfront esplanade and possibly some office and hotel space. The agreement, announced this month, requires Midtown to build 300 below-market-rate housing units in Bridgeport; 50 must be on the Steel Point site. 
 The agreement requires City Council approval. In a recent presentation to the council's Committee on Economic and Community Development, Daniel Pfeffer, Midtown's president, described the housing deal as a significant concession. He pointed out that his firm had stuck by the project even though it had stalled numerous times, and that Midtown was assuming all risk associated with cleaning up the site, which was contaminated decades ago by heavy metals left by factories. 
 Yet critics questioned why more affordable units could not be situated on the peninsula, which the city acquired through eminent domain, and whether any of them could really be called ''affordable'' in the first place.
 James Holloway, a City Council member, said he had watched as low-income people were priced out of Stamford and Norwalk by revitalization and feared something similar in Bridgeport. 
 ''Where are those people going?'' Mr. Holloway asked. ''Up the valley?'' He was referring to the Naugatuck Valley communities north of the city. 
 Members of the local chapter of Acorn, the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, organized a small protest before the council meeting.
 Steel Point's 50 on-site apartments will be priced to be affordable for households earning no more than 105 percent of the overall Bridgeport area's median income, which for a family of four works out to about $81,000. But within Bridgeport itself, the median income is closer to $37,000 -- far too low to buy these units, said Nicholas Graber-Grace, Acorn's statewide organizer. 
 ''It's work-force housing without any of the Bridgeport work force covered,'' he said. 
 According to Ms. Hadley, Steel Point is not conducive to lower-income households because all units will be assessed at full market value, making the property taxes higher than they could afford. The developer will use part of the tax revenue generated from the project to repay $190 million in bonds that will finance new roads and other infrastructure improvements on the development site, she said. 
 Trying to mix affordable housing into high-end developments is a tricky prospect for Bridgeport because it has so much ''catching up to do'' in its revitalization efforts, said Charles Buki, principal of CZB, the Alexandria, Va., consulting firm that conducted the city's housing study. 
 The developer behind Bridgeport's third large project -- $500 million to redevelop a 10-acre industrial site adjacent to Seaside Park, on Long Island Sound -- says its plan does not have a big enough margin to support affordable housing. Unlike the other two, this developer, Westport Property Management, owns the construction site and has not requested special treatment from the city. If it were to do so, Ms. Hadley said, it would be asked to build work-force units in return. 
 Primarily residential, this development envisions 1,200 units in buildings of 2 to 38 stories. A marina, restaurant and boardwalk will all be open to the public. A standard two-bedroom unit will cost about $600,000, a price beyond much of the Bridgeport market, said Stephen Grathwohl, the company's principal.
 ''Bridgeport is bubbling,'' Mr. Grathwohl said. ''A lot of really nice things are on the drawing board.'' But, at this point, ''you don't want to throw a monkey wrench in and stop things.''

HEADLINE: ETHANOL'S BOOM STALLING AS GLUT DEPRESSES PRICES

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

DATELINE: NEVADA, Iowa, Sept. 24 

 BODY:
The ethanol boom of recent years -- which spurred a frenzy of distillery construction, record corn prices, rising food prices and hopes of a new future for rural America -- may be fading. 
 Only last year, farmers here spoke of a biofuel gold rush, and they rejoiced as prices for ethanol and the corn used to produce it set records. 
 But companies and farm cooperatives have built so many distilleries so quickly that the ethanol market is suddenly plagued by a glut, in part because the means to distribute it have not kept pace. The average national ethanol price on the spot market has plunged 30 percent since May, with the decline escalating sharply in the last few weeks.
 ''The end of the ethanol boom is possibly in sight and may already be here,'' said Neil E. Harl, an economics professor emeritus at Iowa State University who lectures on ethanol and is a consultant for producers. ''This is a dangerous time for people who are making investments.'' 
 While generous government support is expected to keep the output of ethanol fuel growing, the poorly planned overexpansion of the industry raises questions about its ability to fulfill the hopes of President Bush and other policy makers to serve as a serious antidote to the nation's heavy reliance on foreign oil.
 And if the bust becomes worse, candidates for president could be put on the spot to pledge even more federal support for the industry, particularly here in Iowa, whose caucus in January is the first contest in the presidential nominating process.
 Many industry experts say the worst problems are temporary and have been intensified by transportation bottlenecks in getting ethanol from the heartland to the coasts, where it is needed most. And even if some farmers who invested in the plants lose money, most of them are reaping a separate bounty from higher prices for corn and other commodities, which are expected to remain elevated for some time.
 Even so, companies are already shelving plans for expansion and canceling new plant construction. If prices fall more, as many analysts predict, there is likely to be a sweeping consolidation of the industry, and some smaller companies could go out of business.
 The falling price of ethanol comes in sharp contrast to the rise in crude oil prices. Lower ethanol prices help reduce gasoline prices at the pump, where ethanol is available, but because it constitutes 10 percent or less in most blends, the impact for the consumer is marginal.
 Congress essentially legislated the industry's expansion by requiring steadily higher quantities of ethanol as a gasoline blend, a kick-start that was further spurred by the proliferation of bans on a competing fuel additive used to help curb air pollution.
 But the ethanol industry, which is also heavily subsidized by federal tax incentives, got far ahead of the requirements of the law, rapidly building scores of plants and snapping up a rising share of the corn harvest. Many of those plants have gone into operation in recent months, and many more are scheduled for completion by the end of next year.
 The resulting ethanol oversupply is buffeting the market. Here in northern Iowa, deep in the corn belt, newly cautious farmers and ethanol executives are figuring out how to cut costs and weighing their options should the situation get worse.
 ''We don't know what, ultimately, the marketplace will price ethanol at,'' said Rick Brehm, president and chief executive of Lincolnway Energy, a midsize distillery here. ''It could go lower.''
 Since construction crews broke ground on the Lincolnway plant in 2005, the price of ethanol on the local market has fallen to $1.55 a gallon from about $2, Mr. Brehm said. Over the same period, the price of corn, representing 70 percent of production costs, has risen to $3.27 a bushel from $1.60. ''We're trapped between two commodities,'' he said.
 Lincolnway was once virtually alone in the region, but now a handful of new competing distilleries are operating and pouring even more ethanol onto the market, offering blenders more options to negotiate lower prices and driving up demand for corn.
 ''Obviously, I'm concerned about where we're going,'' said Bill Couser, chairman of Lincolnway Energy, though he added that his company is still making money and he is optimistic about the future.
 The ethanol boom was set off when Congress enacted an energy law in 2005 that included a national mandate for the use of renewable fuel in gasoline, obliging the market to consume 7.5 billion gallons a year by 2012, compared with 3.5 billion gallons in 2004.
 Already, ethanol producers are poised to outpace that mandate, with capacity expected to reach 7.8 billion gallons by the end of 2007 and 11.5 billion gallons by 2009, although some in the industry are now predicting that the expansion could slow.
 The number of ethanol plants in the country has increased to 129 today from 81 in January 2005, according to the Renewable Fuels Association, while plants under construction or expanding have mushroomed to about 80 from 16 during the same period.
 ''As ethanol supply increases over the next 12 months, the challenge will be to find a home for it,'' said Mark Flannery, head of energy equity research at Credit Suisse. ''The ethanol surplus is here already.''
 Because ethanol is corrosive and soaks up water and impurities, it cannot be shipped through the country's fuel pipeline network. So it must be transported by train, truck and barge, a more expensive transportation network that is suddenly finding it hard to keep up with the surge in ethanol production.
 There is a long backlog in orders for specialized ethanol rail cars to ship the surplus production. Many rail terminals at the ethanol plants do not have spurs large enough to accommodate the long trains that ethanol promoters like to call ''virtual pipelines.'' And pumps from the storage tanks to the rail cars at the terminals often do not have sufficient capacity to load trains quickly and efficiently.
 Phillip C. Baumel, economics professor emeritus at Iowa State University, said that in many cases ethanol producers ramped up their production so rapidly that they gave ''inadequate attention to meeting transportation and distribution needs.''
 Gasoline wholesale marketers have been slow to gear up ethanol blending terminals, in part because they had to invest simultaneously in equipment to manage low sulfur diesel and tougher product specifications.
 Prices of ethanol range widely around the country, even differing from one county to the next in the same state on a daily basis. [The average rack, or wholesale, price reported by the DTN Ethanol Center on Tuesday was $2.42 a gallon in New York and $1.77 in Iowa.] Generally, prices are highest in states farthest away from the Midwest farm belt and in ones that have federal or state clean-air requirements that encourage the use of ethanol.
 In a new study, the Agriculture Department warned of ''several supply chain issues that could inhibit growth in the ethanol industry,'' including a backlog in rail tank car orders that grew to 36,166 rail cars by the end of the first quarter in 2007 from about 10,000 in the third quarter of 2005.
 ''You just can't scale it up overnight,'' said Chuck Baker, vice president and executive director of the National Railroad Construction and Maintenance Association.
 Stiff blending regulations in some southern states like Florida have also been an impediment to ethanol. And so far, only about 1,000 of the 179,000 pumps at gasoline stations around the country offer E-85, a fuel that is 85 percent ethanol and 15 percent gasoline, intended for the five million flex-fuel vehicles on the road that can run on high ethanol blends.
 Major ethanol producers and lobbyists describe the developing gulf between production output and transport capacity as a temporary growing pain that will be alleviated over time.
 ''We have an industry that has doubled in size in just the past couple of years,'' said Bob Dinneen, president of the Renewable Fuels Association. ''It is going to take a little time for the infrastructure to catch up.''
 Some analysts outside the industry think the current market upheaval may be more than simply a hiccup.
 Aaron Brady, a director at the consulting firm Cambridge Energy Research Associates, said the current market problems could worsen if combined with other ''unintended consequences that may be lurking'' from increased ethanol production. He said pressure on corn and other food prices, water shortages, soil and fertilizer runoff could hurt political support for the industry.
 ''If Congress doesn't substantially raise the renewable fuel standard,'' Mr. Brady said, ''then this is not just a short term problem but a long term issue, and there will be more of a shakeout in the industry.''
 The Senate has approved a bill that would require gasoline producers to blend 36 billion gallons of ethanol into gasoline by 2022, an increase from the current standard of 7.5 billion gallons by 2012. The House did not include such a provision in the version it passed, and it is uncertain whether any final legislation will emerge this year and what it will say about ethanol if it does.
 Ethanol proponents say a new energy law is virtually inevitable at some point, and that even if it does not pass this year, lower ethanol prices will provide an incentive for refiners to blend more ethanol into expensive gasoline. A higher renewable fuels standard would force refiners and blenders to work faster to process increased amounts.
 A strong energy law would also increase investment and research into ethanol production from nonfood sources, like switch grass, and persuade auto companies to make more cars that run on blends well beyond the standard low percentage ethanol mixture, ethanol proponents argue.
 ''This is an industry that is going to continue to grow,'' said Bruce Rastetter, chief executive of Hawkeye Renewables, a private company based in nearby Ames that has two distilleries and two more under construction. ''Once you see an energy bill, I think you will see the industry respond again.''
 Still, he has dropped plans to build a fifth plant and take Hawkeye public.

CORRECTION-DATE: October 3, 2007

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, a front-page article in some editions on Sunday about an ethanol glut that is depressing prices misstated the industry's expected capacity over the short term. By the end of this year, ethanol producers are expected to have the capacity to make 7.8 billion gallons a year, not 7.8 million. The article also referred imprecisely to the availability of ethanol nationwide. About 1,000 pumps at the nation's 179,000 gasoline stations offer gasoline blended with ethanol -- not 1,000 of 179,000 pumps.

HEADLINE: Too Cool for School

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE MUHLKE

 BODY:
College is a time of discovery for most students, but perhaps not of the culinary kind. There's a reason that pizza joints flank campuses and that the Cereality restaurant chain -- all cereal, all the time -- now has four university locations. That's why last year Bryan Zupon, a Duke senior, opened a restaurant. In his dorm room.
 Zupon, who is now 21, has always loved food. When other kids in Basking Ridge, N.J., were sent to school with sandwiches, his Japanese mother packed him elaborate obento boxes. When his parents renovated their kitchen, Zupon, then 14, begged for a six-burner Viking stove. After facing the cafeteria at Duke's Durham, N.C., campus in 2004, Zupon set about joining the dining advisory board and persuading the college newspaper to make him the restaurant reviewer, allowing him to infiltrate the area's emerging food scene. 
 But even that ran its course. ''I don't think that New Southern cooking has changed since the mid-'90s,'' Zupon said. ''I'd talked to a lot of big-name chefs in the area -- for personal reasons and also for the newspaper -- and they were so apprehensive to change. I was like, this is frustrating, so I'm just going to do my own thing and see where it takes me.''
 So while his classmates followed A.C.C. basketball, Zupon followed the nation's chefs: he switched to the molecular-gastronomy team after a revelatory meal at WD-50 in New York in 2004. His heroes include ''Wylie, Grant'' -- Wylie Dufresne and Grant Achatz, the chefs of WD-50 and Alinea, respectively. ''And chef Paul Liebrandt -- I really, really, really, really miss Gilt. It was a spectacular meal,'' he says of the dinner he had at the restaurant before Liebrandt left last year.
 The summer before his junior year, Zupon decided to bring a taste of the cutting edge to North Carolina with Z Kitchen. Thanks to a bigger campus apartment and a ''permanent loan'' from his parents to buy a vacuum sealer and two refurbished laboratory water baths for sous-vide cooking, an induction burner and other gee-whiz toys and ingredients, he opened his own underground restaurant and joined the ranks of those offering word-of-mouth dinners in their homes. 
 He was host to his first table of guests that September, and given his presence on Internet chat boards (he had already guest-blogged on egullet.com) and the Raleigh-Durham food scene, he was booked almost every week for the following two semesters -- midterms and finals periods excepted.
 In a short time, word of Zupon's cooking made it up the East Coast. So a few weeks ago, after reserving a place at the first dinner of his senior year, I found myself in a jury-rigged standard-issue kitchen, watching Zupon, in a Burberry polo shirt, pinstripe chinos and Duke flip-flops, put the finishing touches on the six-course meal: warming packets of sunchoke-chorizo puree in one water bath, strips of grass- and grain-fed beef in another; roasting cauliflower in the glorified toaster oven; and setting the table for Jackie Chang, Lisa Chen, Tara Mandalaywala and Allie Hauser, his friends since freshman year. 
 Seated at the '70s Danish institutional table under a sunset painting, the friends joked that since Z Kitchen opened, Zupon has been too busy for their traditional Friday-night dinners, freeing them to go to Macaroni Grill and the other chains he shuns. The first course arrived: a slow-cooked egg with truffle-flecked Sottocenere cheese, asparagus veloute, bacon cooked sous vide and chanterelle mushrooms pickled in rice-wine vinegar -- a dish that wouldn't be out of place in New York or San Francisco. 
 The young women quietly navigated their plates with restrained curiosity. ''I don't even like egg, but I like this,'' said Mandalaywala, a biological anthropology major who noted that she uses the same water baths as Zupon in the school lab. He explained that the egg was a WD-50 dish. Blank stares.
 Five more complex, flavorful courses followed. During the next two and a half hours, the diners were introduced to the potential joys of candied olive crumble with fish; braised short ribs with scallops (''It's very popular in New York,'' he explained); ''fierce, barnyardy'' robiola cheese with fizzy carbonated grapes (''We've had every fruit carbonated by now,'' Chang said); and chai ice cream with miso-sesame chocolate and powdered peach and pineapple. Wylie would be proud.
 ''I want to save this menu and send it to my mom,'' Mandalaywala said when the three-hour meal was finished. 
 The punch line is that Zupon, a media-savvy economics and history major, has no plans to become a chef. ''The hours are too long for the compensation you receive,'' he said. ''It's a hard, sweaty job.'' Instead, he intends to join a major consulting firm next year. Until then, he's learning how much experimental cuisine the local market will bear. This semester, he has dropped the flavored airs. ''I could really drive home the modern technology and source all sorts of crazy stuff,'' he said. ''That's honestly not what people want.''
 Red Snapper With Braised Fennel and Candied Olives
 For the olives:
 1 / 2 cup oil-cured black olives, pitted and finely chopped
 1 tablespoon agave nectar, or light maple syrup
 1 teaspoon sugar
 Salt
 For the fennel:
 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
 2tablespoons butter
 1large bulb fennel, trimmed and cut lengthwise into 8 pieces with the core intact
 Salt and freshly ground black pepper
 1/4 cup dry white wine
 2 1/2 to 3 cups chicken broth
 1 1/2 teaspoons honey
 20 raisins
 For the snapper:
 4 (6-ounce) skin-on red snapper fillets, deboned
 Salt
 2 tablespoons grapeseed oil
 Passion-fruit vinegar (optional).
 1. Preheat oven to 200 degrees. On a parchment-lined baking sheet, stir together the olives, agave nectar, sugar and a pinch of salt. Cook for 1 hour, stirring every 15 minutes. (They will be sticky.) Let cool. They can be stored in a cool, dry place for several days.
 2. Place the oil and butter in a medium-size heavy saucepan set over medium-high heat. Once the butter starts to brown, add the fennel. Season with salt and pepper. Cook until the fennel begins to color around the edges, 2 to 3 minutes.
 3. Add the wine, bring to a boil and let reduce by half. Pour in at least 2 1/2 cups chicken broth to almost cover the fennel. Stir in the honey and raisins. Bring to a boil over high heat, then lower the heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the tip of a paring knife easily pierces the core of the fennel, 20 to 25 minutes. Season the broth and fennel with salt to taste. 
 4. When ready to serve, generously season the fish on all sides with salt. Pour the oil in a large nonstick skillet set over high heat. When the oil is hot, add a piece of fish, skin-side down, pressing on the flesh with a fish spatula for the first few seconds to keep it from curling. Repeat with the remaining pieces. Cook until the edges of the skin are golden and three-fourths of the flesh turns opaque, 4 to 5 minutes. Flip and cook for an additional 1 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a plate lined with a paper towel. 
 5. To serve, place two pieces of fennel, 2 to 3 tablespoons of the braising liquid and a few raisins in the center of a shallow bowl. Lay the fish, skin-side up, against the fennel and place about 1 tablespoon of the candied olives on top. If desired, drizzle the edge of the plate with a few drops of passion-fruit vinegar. Serves 4. Adapted from Bryan Zupon.
 NOTE: Agave nectar can be found at most large grocery stores. A 7-ounce bottle of L'Olivier passion-fruit vinegar is $13 at Amazon.com and is available at select Whole Foods stores.

 BODY:
AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CHARLESTON, a not-exactly-selective institution on the banks of the Kanawha River in the capital city of West Virginia, incoming students take a standardized test designed to measure reasoning and writing skills and then take the test again after sophomore year and once again as seniors -- to see if their education is doing them any good. Courses are constructed around a series of defined ''liberal learning outcomes'' like critical thinking and creativity, and if the students' work shows that many of them aren't hitting the outcomes, the teachers go back to the drawing board. Ditto with the standardized tests. ''We take data seriously,'' says Alan Belcher, a member of the Faculty Center that rides herd on the whole process, ''and we act on it.'' Apparently they act well: in its promotional materials, U.C. boasts that it posted ''the largest learning gain from first to final year'' of any of the 40 schools that participated in a trial of the Collegiate Learning Assessment, one test it uses. 
 This orientation toward measurable outcomes has already colonized many spheres of life -- K-12 education, medicine, government services -- but in the world of higher education, places like the University of Charleston are lonely outliers. They may soon become the vanguard. The Bush administration, having used the No Child Left Behind Act to impose accountability -- and, critics would say, a sterile uniformity -- on the reluctant world of public elementary and secondary schools, is now seeking to accomplish something similar in post-secondary education. A commission impaneled by Education Secretary Margaret Spellings concluded last year that colleges ''should measure and report meaningful student learning outcomes,'' that they should use tests to make comparison possible, that accrediting agencies should make these and other performance outcomes ''the core of their assessment'' and that colleges should make the results publicly available ''as a condition of accreditation.'' 
 The culture of assessment has provided a bracing discipline for the University of Charleston and for a small but growing number of other public and private institutions. But it's fair to ask whether Stanford, say, or the University of Michigan needs any bracing. Do they need to prove that students are getting their money's worth? And do we really want our dotty and beloved professor of medieval history to reverse-engineer his class according to desired student outcomes rather than sticking to the dictates of medieval history? In the upper reaches of academe there is an anxiety, sometimes bordering on panic, that the Bush administration is trying to turn everybody into the University of Charleston and has plans to implement something like No Coed Left Behind. It wouldn't try to do that, would it?
 SPELLINGS WAS George Bush's education adviser in Texas as well as in the White House and was one of the driving forces behind No Child Left Behind, known as N.C.L.B. It was soon after she became secretary of education in 2005 that Spellings impaneled the Commission on the Future of Higher Education. She appointed as chairman Charles Miller, a Texas entrepreneur who played a central role in devising the model for his state's system of public-school testing and accountability -- the forerunner of the national legislation. In 1999, Governor Bush appointed Miller to the Board of the Regents of the University of Texas System, and Miller used his post to make Texas's state university system the first to require the use of standardized testing and publication of the results. Miller saw a strong analogy between the problems of public schools and of higher education. ''You take students who aren't prepared and then you toss them overboard,'' as Miller put it in a phone conversation this summer. ''Time on task has shrunk a lot. You can't schedule a class Thursday afternoon or Friday, or no one will come. What you get is a happy professoriat and good grades. That's a system that's dysfunctional, and it shows.''
 Miller is not exactly a consensus builder by nature. As head of the federal commission, he chose consultants who largely shared his views and scheduled public testimony that largely confirmed his fears. An initial draft of the commission's report embodied Miller's dim regard for the educational establishment, as well as his belief in standardized testing. When parts of the draft were made public, that establishment, already deeply suspicious of the administration and all its works, recoiled in horror. David L. Warren, president of the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities and among the most vehement of the commission's critics, describes the expert witnesses who testified before the commission as ''a parade of malcontents who came out with their theories about the failure of American higher education.'' The administration's goal, Warren insists, was to take N.C.L.B., its most cherished domestic initiative, and ''launch it in higher education.''
 Spellings says that the federal role in higher education will be limited to getting out the facts, though she emphasized to me that if she ''were the governor of a state, I might want to do something with that information.'' She has not managed to persuade either the innumerable associations whose job it is to defend the interests of the higher-education industry or academic leaders themselves of the value of this kind of testing. Henry Bienen, the president of Northwestern University, says of the administration's interest in college assessment: ''I think what's being done is less a burning wish to know what we have done'' than a ''kind of clunking of them over the head.'' Why, he asks, won't the Bush folks ''accept the wisdom of the marketplace,'' which says that places like Northwestern have very happy customers? Bienen agrees that higher education hasn't been very accountable about outcomes but says that standardized measures would not get at the kind of learning at which the finest universities aim. That, he said, would require ''quite sophisticated analytical tools'' and presumably a very long time. 
 It is in no small part the expression ''standardized test'' that conjures the N.C.L.B. bogey. Charles Miller is a great proponent of the Collegiate Learning Assessment; Sarah Martinez Tucker, the undersecretary of education who was a member of the commission, is a former member of the C.L.A.'s board. David Warren asserts that the ''digitized approach'' embodied in many standardized tests ''trivializes a very complicated process of how learning and teaching transpire.'' ''The Study of Undergraduate Learning'' at the University of Washington is said to have shown that writing and critical and quantitative thinking ''are not generic skills'' but rather are ''mediated by the disciplines,'' so that any attempt to measure broad competencies is futile. 
 If that's so, then tests like the C.L.A. are useless. But the scholars who first developed the system have spent seven years fine-tuning it, and the C.L.A. is light years ahead of the fill-in-the-blanks format of most standardized tests. Students are given lengthy writing assignments, along with a ''performance task'' in which they are furnished with a set of documents and then instructed to analyze them in order to produce a memo or report -- like, say, a city official trying to trace a puzzling source of pollution and to recommend a course of action. It's hard to see how you can be well educated and do badly on the test, or vice versa. Schools like Harvard and Duke now administer it to students, though neither publishes the results. According to the former president of Trinity College, Richard Hersh, who played a key role in designing the test, a study of results at 200 colleges representing a cross-section of institutions shows, not surprisingly, that some places do a much more effective job of teaching than others. ''Great teaching makes a difference,'' he says, ''and the culture in which you're embedded makes a difference.'' Just as in high school.
 WHEN EDWIN WELCH became president of the University of Charleston in 1989, he found that despite the grandiose name, he was running a community college. ''The average age of the kids was 26 or older,'' he recalls. ''Most were taking two-year programs, the largest in nursing. Enrollment had dropped as low as 490. In the community, we were basically known as a party school.'' Charleston, in short, had a market problem. The low road wasn't working; Welch, a social scientist with a deep fund of common sense and mother wit, concluded that the opportunities lay on the high road of academic competence. As it happened, he also sat on the quality committee of the local hospital, and he heard an administrator of a mental-health center talk about how they had to document quantifiable progress in some patients' conditions to receive reimbursement. The center was forced to focus on outcomes. ''My challenge,'' he says, ''was, How do I bring this to education?''
 A schoolwide process of rethinking, in which you imagine Welch functioned as something more than first among equals, concluded that the school should shape its identity around outcomes. The question that he and his colleagues asked themselves, Welch says, was, ''What do you want from a liberal arts education?'' The obvious answers were curricular ones -- a familiarity with history, with the major works of literature and philosophy, with core scientific disciplines. But curricular mastery, the group concluded, was the means rather than the end. The goal was a set of broad competencies that spanned disciplines: citizenship, communication, creativity, critical thinking, ethical practice and science. The idea was not to teach these skills directly, which would be vapid, but rather to embed them in the curriculum and to shape pedagogy and assignments so that students would gain the competencies in the course of their studies. Thus, for example, a student in the interior-design program can gain ''historical understanding'' from one specialized class, ''foundational creativity'' from still others and ''research in the discipline'' -- a science outcome -- from yet another. He or she may have to take a class in literature and several in science to satisfy other outcome requirements.
 The liberal-learning outcomes are quantifiable -- performance on them counts for 20 to 50 percent of a student's grade -- but not, of course, standardized. Yet Charleston does believe strongly in standardized tests, at least good ones. Seven years ago, the school began administering a test now known as MAPP, which showed that in several cognitive areas its students were making more progress in their first two years than students at similar liberal-arts colleges were in four. But students were making little additional progress in the last two years, and perhaps in the last three. So the faculty decided to embed more critical-thinking outcomes in courses that students encounter in later years. When the C.L.A. was introduced, Charleston quickly instituted it. When the test was administered in 2005-6, incoming freshmen scored well below where their SAT scores would have predicted, while seniors scored at par. No other school showed such gains. The ''gains,'' of course, were extrapolated from two different sets of students, at the beginning and at the end of their college careers -- not a very convincing outcome. That hasn't stopped Charleston from boasting about the results. Certainly there's no denying that Ed Welch's bold act of repositioning has transformed the school. U.C. now has about 1,400 students. Average SAT scores of incoming students are rising, and the school has begun to turn some applicants away. Six of the 10 campus buildings have gone up in the last decade. The endowment has reached $35 million. And in the ultimate market affirmation, U.S. News & World Report now ranks U.C. among the Top 20 baccalaureate colleges in the South. 
 A research university, or for that matter a more ambitious undergraduate college, would probably not want to emulate the University of Charleston, where the word ''content'' is used in an oddly pejorative or slighting sense, as the means by which ''skills'' are improved. It is a utilitarian institution. ''Learning your way,'' as one of its marketing pitches has it, ''is our focus.'' In this, however, it is like the overwhelming majority of American post-secondary institutions, of which only a small fraction are even marginally selective. Pleasing the customer is necessarily the name of the game.
 STANFORD SHOULD PROBABLY not start behaving like the University of Charleston, but there isn't much danger of that. The far more pressing problem is that a tradition of college autonomy will preclude any sort of concerted action to improve higher education. Even the august Derek Bok, the former president of Harvard, recently wrote in ''Our Underachieving Colleges'' that ''the prospects for turning colleges into effective learning organizations'' are ''not good,'' since ''important faculty interests'' stand in the way of doing so. Bok singles out the reluctance to measure outcomes as a symptom of that resistance. But political pressure is eroding the resistance. The National Association of State Universities and Land Grant Colleges and the American Association of State Colleges and Universities are now considering a voluntary initiative in which their members will administer ''core learning outcome tests'' like the C.L.A. and publish the results. Public universities, of course, have to be acutely sensitive to the whims of state legislators. Peter McPherson, the head of the National Association of State Universities and Land Grant Colleges, describes the testing initiative as ''something we could construct in a way that helps us get stronger, rather than government forcing it in a way that would be much more rigid.'' 
 The battle over accountability has many different skirmish lines. Private institutions like the University of Charleston are adapting to the marketplace. Public universities are warding off state action. State governments are talking about mandating assessment. In Washington, the great buzzing hive of associations seems, for now, to have successfully swarmed its adversary. After the commission published its report, Spellings convened a ''negotiated rule-making'' process. She wanted, among other things, to ensure that regional accrediting agencies demand that the institutions they accredit use objective outcome measurements. This was deemed an unprecedented attack on the autonomy of accrediting agencies and universities. Both turned to their friends in Congress. And in late May, just days before the rule-making process on accreditation was to conclude, Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, former secretary of education and ranking minority member on the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, accused the Bush administration of ''proposing to restrict autonomy, choice and competition.'' Alexander wrote to Spellings, telling her to leave these thorny issues to Congress. Spellings promptly complied. ''Congress,'' says the crusty Charles Miller, ''is in the thrall of the academy.''
 That grip is bound to weaken. The self-accountability of our system of higher education is grounded in the optional nature of college attendance. But college isn't really optional any longer. The economic value of higher education, on both the individual and the national levels, has given the public a stake in outcomes not so different from the stake it has in the public schools. Even private institutions, in this regard, are quasi-public entities. Almost 25 years ago, Margaret Spellings points out, the report known as ''A Nation at Risk'' provoked a national discussion about education that has not yet subsided. ''I think,'' she says, ''that's what has been precipitated'' by her own report. ''It's only just begun.''

 BODY:
THE SHOCK DOCTRINE 
 The Rise of Disaster Capitalism. 
 By Naomi Klein. 
 558 pp. Metropolitan Books. $28. 
 There are no accidents in the world as seen by Naomi Klein. The destruction of New Orleans by Hurricane Katrina expelled many poor black residents and allowed most of the city's public schools to be replaced by privately run charter schools. The torture and killings under Gen. Augusto Pinochet in Chile and during Argentina's military dictatorship were a way of breaking down resistance to the free market. The instability in Poland and Russia after the collapse of Communism and in Bolivia after the hyperinflation of the 1980s allowed the governments there to foist unpopular economic ''shock therapy'' on a resistant population. And then there is ''Washington's game plan for Iraq'': ''Shock and terrorize the entire country, deliberately ruin its infrastructure, do nothing while its culture and history are ransacked, then make it all O.K. with an unlimited supply of cheap household appliances and imported junk food,'' not to mention a strong stock market and private sector. 
 ''The Shock Doctrine'' is Klein's ambitious look at the economic history of the last 50 years and the rise of free-market fundamentalism around the world. ''Disaster capitalism,'' as she calls it, is a violent system that sometimes requires terror to do its job. Like Pol Pot proclaiming that Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge was in Year Zero, extreme capitalism loves a blank slate, often finding its opening after crises or ''shocks.'' For example, Klein argues, the Asian crisis of 1997 paved the way for the International Monetary Fund to establish programs in the region and for a sell-off of many state-owned enterprises to Western banks and multinationals. The 2004 tsunami enabled the government of Sri Lanka to force the fishermen off beachfront property so it could be sold to hotel developers. The destruction of 9/11 allowed George W. Bush to launch a war aimed at producing a free-market Iraq. 
 In an early chapter, Klein compares radical capitalist economic policy to shock therapy administered by psychiatrists. She interviews Gail Kastner, a victim of covert C.I.A. experiments in interrogation techniques that were carried out by the scientist Ewen Cameron in the 1950s. His idea was to use electroshock therapy to break down patients. Once ''complete depatterning'' had been achieved, the patients could be reprogrammed. But after breaking down his ''patients,'' Cameron was never able to build them back up again. The connection with a rogue C.I.A. scientist is overdramatic and unconvincing, but for Klein the larger lessons are clear: ''Countries are shocked -- by wars, terror attacks, coups d'etat and natural disasters.'' Then ''they are shocked again -- by corporations and politicians who exploit the fear and disorientation of this first shock to push through economic shock therapy.'' People who ''dare to resist'' are shocked for a third time, ''by police, soldiers and prison interrogators.''
 In another introductory chapter, Klein offers an account of Milton Friedman -- she calls him ''the other doctor shock'' -- and his battle for the hearts and minds of Latin American economists and economies. In the 1950s, as Cameron was conducting his experiments, the Chicago School was developing the ideas that would eclipse the theories of Raul Prebisch, an advocate of what today would be called the third way, and of other economists fashionable in Latin America at the time. She quotes the Chilean economist Orlando Letelier on the ''inner harmony'' between the terror of the Pinochet regime and its free-market policies. Letelier said that Milton Friedman shared responsibility for the regime's crimes, rejecting his argument that he was only offering ''technical'' advice. Letelier was killed in 1976 by a car bomb planted in Washington by Pinochet's secret police. For Klein, he was another victim of the ''Chicago Boys'' who wanted to impose free-market capitalism on the region. ''In the Southern Cone, where contemporary capitalism was born, the 'war on terror' was a war against all obstacles to the new order,'' she writes. 
 One of the world's most famous antiglobalization activists and the author of the best seller ''No Logo: Taking Aim at the Brand Bullies,'' Klein provides a rich description of the political machinations required to force unsavory economic policies on resisting countries, and of the human toll. She paints a disturbing portrait of hubris, not only on the part of Friedman but also of those who adopted his doctrines, sometimes to pursue more corporatist objectives. It is striking to be reminded how many of the people involved in the Iraq war were involved earlier in other shameful episodes in United States foreign policy history. She draws a clear line from the torture in Latin America in the 1970s to that at Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo Bay.
 Klein is not an academic and cannot be judged as one. There are many places in her book where she oversimplifies. But Friedman and the other shock therapists were also guilty of oversimplification, basing their belief in the perfection of market economies on models that assumed perfect information, perfect competition, perfect risk markets. Indeed, the case against these policies is even stronger than the one Klein makes. They were never based on solid empirical and theoretical foundations, and even as many of these policies were being pushed, academic economists were explaining the limitations of markets -- for instance, whenever information is imperfect, which is to say always. 
 Klein isn't an economist but a journalist, and she travels the world to find out firsthand what really happened on the ground during the privatization of Iraq, the aftermath of the Asian tsunami, the continuing Polish transition to capitalism and the years after the African National Congress took power in South Africa, when it failed to pursue the redistributionist policies enshrined in the Freedom Charter, its statement of core principles. These chapters are the least exciting parts of the book, but they are also the most convincing. In the case of South Africa, she interviews activists and others, only to find there is no one answer. Busy trying to stave off civil war in the early years after the end of apartheid, the A.N.C. didn't fully understand how important economic policy was. Afraid of scaring off foreign investors, it took the advice of the I.M.F. and the World Bank and instituted a policy of privatization, spending cutbacks, labor flexibility and so on. This didn't stop two of South Africa's own major companies, South African Breweries and Anglo-American, from relocating their global headquarters to London. The average growth rate has been a disappointing 5 percent (much lower than in countries in East Asia, which followed a different route); unemployment for the black majority is 48 percent; and the number of people living on less than $1 a day has doubled to four million from two million since 1994, the year the A.N.C. took over.
 Some readers may see Klein's findings as evidence of a giant conspiracy, a conclusion she explicitly disavows. It's not the conspiracies that wreck the world but the series of wrong turns, failed policies, andlittle and big unfairnesses that add up. Still, those decisions are guided by larger mind-sets. Market fundamentalists never really appreciated the institutions required to make an economy function well, let alone the broader social fabric that civilizations require to prosper and flourish. Klein ends on a hopeful note, describing nongovernmental organizations and activists around the world who are trying to make a difference. After 500 pages of ''The Shock Doctrine,'' it's clear they have their work cut out for them.

BYLINE: By ANDREW DELBANCO. 
Andrew Delbanco is the director of American studies and Levi Professor in the Humanities at Columbia University.

 BODY:
In ''Sicko,''Michael Moore's film about greed and collusion in the American health-care system, he lists the price of college among the great injustices of American life. The comment comes in a voice-over that almost seems a teaser for Moore's next movie -- in which, perhaps, we'll find him with his trademark bullhorn standing outside some lavish college president's house, demanding to know why students carry mountains of debt while the prez gets driven around in a luxe limo. 
 Whatever the merits of Moore's films, his analogy between medicine and education is not a bad one. Health care has become an inescapable political issue because most Americans are angry that it costs so much, while at least some Americans think it's wrong that only the relatively rich can count on getting the best of it. The same inequities are evident in higher education, and public concern, if not yet an outcry, is on the rise. 
 For many parents, the cost of college casts a long shadow before and beyond the time their child actually spends in college. With financial aid lagging behind tuition at private institutions and state subsidies declining at public ones, it gets harder every year for low-income students to pay their way. Like hospitals, colleges have generally got the benefit of the doubt on the question of why they cost so much, and many people still regard them as selfless institutions above and beyond the self-serving rules of the marketplace. But their reputation for probity and virtue is deteriorating fast. 
 It's happening at every rung of the academic ladder. A few months ago, the board chairman at Roger Williams University resigned after using the ''N'' word at a board meeting. Not long before, the president of Eastern Michigan University was fired for covering up the rape and murder of a student, and more recently, a review panel sharply criticized the senior administrators at Virginia Tech over their handling of the shooting rampage on campus. Last April, the admissions dean at M.I.T., known for counseling students to avoid padding their resumes, resigned when it turned out she never attended the schools from which she claimed to hold degrees.
 As for the faculty, once portrayed affectionately in fiction and film as bumbling bookworms, today's professors are more likely to be seen as jet-setting self-promoters. And students don't fare much better. Think of Tom Wolfe's college novel, ''I Am Charlotte Simmons,'' in which students have their mouths fastened perpetually to the spigot of a beer keg except when taking a break to have sex. Some seem capable of doing both simultaneously. Of course, such images of campus life amount to something between satire and slander, but they do expose a problem with the standing of higher education in the public mind -- even as the struggle for admission to selective colleges gets more ferocious every year. It all suggests an unhealthy mixture of desire and distrust. Last December, the distrust reached Capitol Hill when Senator Charles Grassley, then the Republican chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, convened hearings on whether colleges were turning their tax advantages into perks for their supporters and themselves. Grassley was prompted in part by ''The Price of Admission,'' an indignant book by a Wall Street Journal reporter, Daniel Golden, which charged that big donors to private colleges are, in effect, buying slots for their children by giving gifts that are tax-deductible for the giver and tax-free for the recipient. 
 The larger question on the senators' minds was whether private colleges and universities are abusing the public trust. After all, they pay no taxes on tuition revenue or on the income from their endowments, of which Harvard boasts the largest -- $35 billion, which has lately been earning around $5 billion a year. In order to keep their tax-exempt status, other nonprofit institutions (charitable foundations, for example) are required to give away a hefty percentage of their money. Hospitals are required to care for indigent patients. But what, exactly, are colleges doing to justify their public subsidies?
 College presidents, naturally, are armed with answers. They point out that America's colleges and universities are the best in the world, in large part because of the uniquely American partnership between public financing and private philanthropy. Universities create jobs, develop new therapies and technologies and train America's young people for the modern knowledge economy. All this is true. But comparable claims could be made for a pharmaceutical company. What makes the modern university different from any other corporation?
 There is more and more reason to think: less and less. Driven by big science and global competition, our top universities compete for ''market share'' and ''brand-name positioning,'' employ teams of consultants and lobbyists and furnish their campuses with luxuries in order to attract paying ''customers'' -- a word increasingly used as a synonym for students. Since 1980, when Congress passed the Bayh-Dole Act permitting patents on discoveries made with public funds, universities and faculty members have been raking in royalties from technologies developed with the help of government grants. More recently, universities have been expanding into adjacent neighborhoods (Harvard into Allston, Columbia into Harlem, Penn into an undeveloped tract near its current campus) and establishing satellite campuses abroad. Yale has announced the acquisition of an entirely new research campus outside New Haven --from, as it happens, a pharmaceutical company. 
 How are college students treated in this brave new academic world? Not very well, at least not if this year's spate of bad news articles is any indication. Last spring, New York's attorney general, Andrew Cuomo, charged financial-aid counselors at several universities, including my own, with profiting personally from business ties with private lenders to whom they were sending students in need of loans. Since then, Cuomo has begun a new investigation into whether study-abroad programs amount to price-fixing schemes. Meanwhile, to compensate for the loss of state subsidies, public universities appear to be billing students for ''energy,'' ''technology'' and ''incidental'' fees, which can add up to as much as a 40 percent surcharge on tuition. And what are students getting for their money? After years of fanfare, the Harvard faculty concluded its curriculum review, prompting this low assessment from the student newspaper: ''Instead of crafting a meaningful statement of what it means to be educated in today's world, professors only seemed to care [about] their parochial corner of academia . . . leaving Harvard with an uninspired retread of its core curriculum.''
 To be sure, there is good news too. There is growing recognition that if our colleges are to be engines of social mobility as they claim to be, they must open their doors wider to low-income students. Several generous gifts have lately been earmarked to support financial aid. And a serious debate has begun over the idea of ''affirmative action for the poor,'' whereby low-income applicants who do well in high school against the odds would get a ''thumb on the scale'' in the admissions process.
 Refreshingly enough, the old assumption that college spans the four years between 18 and 22 is no longer broadly true. More than half of American undergraduates are now ''nontraditional'' adult students attending community colleges or night classes or earning credits, even degrees, from online institutions, some of which operate for profit. Meanwhile, the rapid expansion of M.A. programs has allowed undergraduates who can afford them (these programs offer little financial aid) to tack on an extra year of course work to their campus years. At the other end of the age spectrum, the ''early college'' movement, led by Bard College and based on the model of the German Gymnasium, is experimenting with accelerated schools at which students advance over four years from ninth grade through the first two years of college.
 So today's college students are both older and younger than their predecessors. This loosening of the confinement of ''college'' to the years 18 to 22 is overdue. The human life cycle, after all, has stretched at both ends in modern times -- childhood ends sooner; young people reach sexual maturity (or at least sophistication) earlier; people marry and die later -- so why, especially in view of the immense explosion of knowledge requisite for a true education, shouldn't the time allotted for college stretch too?
 But there is a prior and deeper question: Should the mission of college go beyond imparting skills and handing out a useful credential? In his 2003 book, ''Universities in the Marketplace,'' Derek Bok, the former Harvard president, made the shocking observation that ''faculties currently display scant interest in preparing undergraduates to be democratic citizens, a task once regarded as the principal purpose of a liberal education and one urgently needed at this moment in the United States.'' Bok was right on both counts -- the neglect and the urgency -- but he relegated his statement to a footnote. It should have been a headline. 
 College today is a place in which students from many backgrounds converge, and it is neither feasible nor desirable to prescribe for them some common morality. But college should be a place that fosters open debate of the ethical issues posed by modern life -- by genetic screening and engineering; by the blurring of the lines dividing birth, life and death; by the global clash between liberal individualism and fundamentalism. And, to press Moore's analogy, it should be a place in which students are treated as more than sources of revenue, just as we want doctors to treat patients without keeping one eye on the clock. 
 Some signs suggest that higher education is waking up to its higher obligations. There is more and more interest in teaching great books that provoke students to think about justice and responsibility and how to live a meaningful life. Applications are up at Columbia and the University of Chicago, which have compulsory great-books courses; students at Yale show growing interest in the ''Directed Study'' program, in which they read the classics; and respected smaller institutions like Ursinus College in Pennsylvania have built their own core curriculums around major works of philosophy and literature. At many colleges, there is also growing emphasis on service-learning, in which students in an earth-science course, for instance, move out of the lab to work with an environmental advocacy group or students in an urban-sociology course work with kids in the local community who are coping with various forms of deprivation. These sorts of engagement do not have to be disconnected from rigorous academic study; they work best when tied to the traditional modes of learning through reading, lecture and discussion. Nor must they be a form of feel-good tokenism whereby the privileged make a few charitable gestures before getting on with their lives. They can be profoundly transformative experiences that bolster the motive -- indeed, the need -- to live a life of civic engagement.
 As our children go through the arduous process of choosing a college and trying to persuade that college to choose them, it will be a sign of improved social health if we can get to the point of asking not about the school's ranking but whether it's a place that helps students confront hard questions in an informed way. If and when the answer is yes, that's a college worthy of support, and all the alumni gifts and tax breaks can never be enough.

HEADLINE: In the Valley of the Shadow

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH D. SAMET. 
Elizabeth D. Samet teaches English at the United States Military Academy. Portions of this essay have been adapted from her book ''Soldier's Heart: Reading Literature Through Peace and War at West Point,'' which will be published next month by Farrar, Straus & Giroux. The views expressed in this article are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the United States Military Academy, the Department of the Army or the Department of Defense.

 BODY:
I.
 WHAT DOES IT MEAN for an undergraduate to pass the morning reading Milton's Paradise Lost''and the afternoon parachuting from a helicopter? To spend the summer learning to control vehicle checkpoints or call in air strikes, the winter writing a senior thesis on the poetry of William Butler Yeats or the novels of Virginia Woolf? To read, as a senior in a literature elective, T.E. Lawrence's account of his operations in Mesopotamia during World War I and to be deployed to Iraq the following year? These are the kinds of questions that routinely occur to you when you are an English professor at West Point, where I have taught for 10 years and where, upon graduation, all of my students will become second lieutenants in the United States Army. 
 The cadet career is divided into three programs: physical, military and academic. There is often a reassuring clarity to the first two -- the clarity that comes from training to tangible standards and attaining measurable goals -- but in the last realm, especially with those disciplines in which results cannot be quantified, ambiguity holds dominion. Teaching cadets to contend with ambiguity is an elemental part of the academic program's charge, and perhaps nowhere at West Point is there more ambiguity per square inch than in a poetry classroom. Poetry and military language share an impulse toward concision, but the fierce economy of acronyms is a world away from the teasing ellipses of poetry. In sharp contrast to the bottom-line-upfront (BLUF) mandate of an operations order, the involuted metaphors of a sonnet are downright cryptic. 
 II.
 WALLACE STEVENS DESCRIBED POETRY as ''a pheasant disappearing in the brush.'' Every spring more than a thousand plebes -- as freshmen at West Point are called -- hunt that pheasant through a core course on literature. They study other genres as well, but lyric poetry, with its characteristic intimacy and introspection, has long held pride of place in my classroom. ''Optempo,'' as soldiers refer to the pace of military life, is fast; poetry helps cadets inured to racing from one activity to another uncover those intricate details perceptible only at slower speeds.
 Sometimes the pace strikes them, conditioned as they have become to moving at warp speed, as unnatural. Shakespeare's Sonnet 73 is a poem that discloses through a series of metaphors -- for his lover's benefit, the speaker compares his stage of life to autumn, twilight and dying embers -- something essential about our nature as ephemeral creatures. At the end of one class devoted to an in-depth discussion of the first quatrain, a plebe named Steven looked up in amazement at the clock and said with chagrin: ''Ma'am, we must be really stupid. We just spent an hour on one sentence.'' Yet by the end of the semester, the plebes have learned to take delight in such painstaking attention to the words and sounds of poetry: in the ''sessions of sweet silent thought'' of Shakespeare's Sonnet 30, the ''luscious clusters'' of Andrew Marvell's ''Garden,'' the ''savage servility'' of Robert Lowell's ''For the Union Dead,'' the ''concupiscent curds'' of Stevens's ''Emperor of Ice-Cream'' -- the more outrageous the better.
 Reciting poetry from memory is one of the course's rites of passage. A number of students report that particular poems stick, recurring to them at opportune moments: as a lieutenant, Andy carried Stevens with him in the Sunni Triangle; David, a captain who will return to West Point in a few years to teach English, still signs off his e-mail messages from Iraq with lines from Shakespeare's ''Henry V,'' long passages of which he memorized as a plebe. Joey had Marvell stuck in his head while leading his infantry platoon through the streets of Baghdad. What a remarkable counterpoint to the sights and sounds of a patrol must Marvell's ''happy garden-state'' have seemed.
 Poetry of all kinds, but war poetry in particular, has a different significance for a cadet at West Point than it does for undergraduates at most other colleges and universities. A plebe literature classroom invites an unflinching look at both the romance and the reality of the profession to which the cadets have committed themselves. My students can readily envision themselves the speaker of a poem like Thomas Hardy's ''Man He Killed,'' in which a soldier muses that under different circumstances he might have treated the same ''fellow'' he has just shot to a drink at a bar. Richard Wilbur's ''First Snow in Alsace,'' closing with a soldier's ''boyish boast'' that ''he was the first to see the snow,'' offers them a picture of nature momentarily blanketing the ugliness of war. In Donald Hall's ''Man in the Dead Machine,'' they encounter a World War II pilot apparently suspended in two parallel universes. In the first, he is a sun-bleached skeleton in the cockpit of a fighter that has crashed into an uninhabited New Guinea hillside; in the second, he is a veteran train commuter clutching his briefcase along with the lifeline the fates have granted him. There is relief but also more than a touch of envy in the anonymous office worker's imagining of the exceptional heroic self that might have been.
 III.
 ''POETRY,'' WROTE STEVENS, 'is a meteor.'' This is true in several senses of Randall Jarrell's ''Death of the Ball Turret Gunner'': ''From my mother's sleep I fell into the State, / And I hunched in its belly till my wet fur froze. / 
 Six miles from earth, loosed from its dream of life, / I woke to black flak and the nightmare fighters. / When I died they washed me out of the turret with a hose.'' I started to read Jarrell's poem with the plebes long before our current engagements in Afghanistan and Iraq. I learned from experience to withhold until the end of class the information that during World War II Jarrell had served as a celestial-navigation tower operator rather than as a member of a bomber crew. The cadets seemed manifestly untroubled by some of the poem's more vexing elements: by the fact that the speaker is describing his own death apparently from beyond the grave or by the brutality of his end.
 Yet whenever the subject of Jarrell's biography came up, the plebes seemed disappointed. When I asked if it mattered whether he had actually served as a ball-turret gunner, they would become passionately insistent: ''Yes, ma'am, of course it matters. If he didn't, it ruins the poem.'' ''But he couldn't experience his own death and then write about it, could he?'' I would venture. ''No,'' would come the reluctant response, ''but it still matters. Somehow, it still matters.'' Because it mattered so very much, many of the plebes, though not yet battle-tested, could not at first see the incongruity of demanding more of Randall Jarrell than they did of themselves. Owning war is one of the things for which plebes will fight hardest, and they guard even wars of the imagination rather jealously. When they get to know you a bit better, they will admit that they wonder sometimes if they have what it takes. Who doesn't? But the stakes are higher for them than they have ever been for me.
 IV.
 TODAY, OF COURSE, war is no longer a matter for conjecture. Beside a hedge at one end of the West Point Cemetery -- the resting place of many Military Academy graduates including George Armstrong Custer and Ulysses S. Grant's son Frederick Dent Grant -- there is a row of new graves.
 The number of combat veterans entering the Corps of Cadets (West Point's student body) is on the rise. For the last several years, the juniors and seniors populating the poetry elective I teach have been able quite vividly to imagine themselves in Afghanistan or Iraq. I typically include a unit on Chinese poetry in this class that is otherwise focused primarily on American and British work. In the Chinese tradition, poems about war tend to skip the fighting itself, a phenomenon called the ''ellipsis of battle.'' Accounts of the preparation for war are followed by descriptions of destruction's aftermath. Students familiar with Homer, the World War I poets Wilfred Owen and Siegfried Sassoon and Tim O'Brien's books on the Vietnam War find this oblique approach rather strange. The blood-spewing Spartan warriors of Steven Pressfield's historical novel about the battle between the Greeks and Persians at Thermopylae, ''Gates of Fire,'' which is quite popular among cadets, couldn't be further from the reticent frontier guard, a recurring persona in Chinese poetry, or from the speaker of a Han dynasty folk song who reports simply that he left for the wars at 15 to return home at 80.
 A senior named Brittany, who is now a lieutenant preparing to deploy to Iraq, was surprised by her own response to ''War South of the Great Wall,'' by the great Tang Dynasty poet Li Po, which presents the battlefield as a dreamscape overhung by a blood red sun. Living soldiers have turned to ''ghosts,'' while the birds that feed on the dead can no longer fly -- in David Hinton's translation, they are ''grief glutted, earthbound.'' Brittany confessed that she didn't think she could be moved by poems about war anymore, but this one struck her in the gut. Li Po, by omitting what Brittany had come to regard as essential to the representation of war, seemed to communicate some important knowledge to her. ''The poet,'' Stevens proposed, ''is the priest of the invisible.''
 With its songs of empty rooms and border towns, of solitary moonlit journeys by boat and by foot, of letters unanswered, of possibly permanent farewells, classical Chinese poetry also illuminates something of the art of separation, an art that anyone connected with military life has been compelled to master in recent years. Soldiers are creatures of arrival and departure. Perhaps it is no coincidence that the Army's term for a deadline is a ''suspense,'' sometimes abbreviated simply ''S:'' and followed by a date. The first time I was told that I had to ''meet a suspense,'' I didn't know where to turn, but now I understand the aptness of referring even to an end by a term most of us associate with uncertainty. The Army is a life of perpetual suspense: the soldier waits for war to begin and then waits for it to end.
 V.
 YOU MAY NOT BE INTERESTED in war, to paraphrase Trotsky, but war is interested in you. War is interested in cadets, and they are interested in war, but that doesn't mean they relish it. Several years ago, Brad, a sophomore who was in my literature class the year before, came to see me, upset by a conversation with a civilian friend. Over coffee one day, she declared, ''I don't understand why you want to kill people.'' That is not at all, of course, what Brad wants to do, even though he knows he might have to one day, and he was distressed by his friend's assumption about his blood lust. He wasn't naive and was prepared to account for his own actions in war, yet he also knew that being an officer would require a different measure of commitment and an acceptance of responsibility for other lives.
 Soldiers rise to emergencies. I don't mean that they like them or even secretly hope for them, but crises are what they train for. Presented with one, they immediately feel more at ease, more comfortable in their roles. They can do something, even if it is only surveying the wreckage. At other times they are like policemen in a city without crime, physicians in a kingdom of androids. To do something was what so many of them needed after Sept. 11, but that need expressed itself much less often as a simple desire for vengeance than as sadness, even unwarranted guilt, at having somehow failed to defend what they had sworn to defend.
 Lately I've been carrying around a copy of Cormac McCarthy's ''Blood Meridian,'' given to me by a lieutenant. On the first page, McCarthy describes how his protagonist, the kid, gets to be the way he is: ''He can neither read nor write and in him broods already a taste for mindless violence.'' The kid is the antithesis of Brad, whose taste doesn't run to mindless violence. Cadets are trained to be confident and sure -- qualities that sometimes butt up against the kind of intellectual inquiry that can erode certainty -- but over the last several years, they have been compelled to think carefully about what they might be asked to do. They know their lives may contain a share of necessary violence, but, at their best, they have the courage to meet brutality with imagination as well as ammunition, to engage ambiguity rather than running away from it.
 Several months after our conversation, I checked in with Brad. A summer in the woods in charge of new cadets had renewed his commitment to the Army: ''I finally have a good understanding of what my job is going to be, and as far as I am interpreting it right now it is to take care of these people. The mutual respect we built was quite amazing. I know that my new cadets would follow me anywhere and do anything that I asked of them, and in return they understood that I was there to teach and to take care of them. I cannot express the feeling that springs from this type of relationship. . . . I have begun to come into a place in which I am comfortable; I just don't know exactly where that place is.''
 VI.
 READING TOLSTOY'S ''WAR AND PEACE'' at around the same time I heard from Brad, I was struck by the passage in which Prince Andrey's friend Pierre asks him what he is ''going to war for.'' ''What for?'' responds Andrey. ''I don't know. Because I have to. Besides, I'm going . . . I'm going because the life I lead here, this life is -- not to my taste!'' Like Brad, Andrey didn't have a ready answer for his civilian friend. After going to war, moreover, his motivations become even more complicated, almost impossible to articulate. Andrey loves glory yet feels its emptiness. He bears a deep responsibility to the men of his regiment, a love of country and a full recognition of the waste of war. All of these causes and desires battle within him even as he fights the enemy. I told Brad the story of Prince Andrey. What I guess I wanted him to understand was that thoughtful soldiers will endure moments of ambivalence.
 I have become increasingly preoccupied with Prince Andrey as the Iraq war drags on. I think of the overwhelming pride and pleasure with which, disillusioned as he has become with the pursuit of glory, he responds to General Kutuzov's recollection of the courageous charge in which Andrey had been given up for dead. ''I remember you at Austerlitz,'' the old general tells him, ''I remember, I remember you with the flag!'' I think, too, of the fate that awaits Andrey at Borodino, where he receives the wound that eventually kills him. Even as I know that fewer wars would be fought if the Andreys of the world stopped feeling the primal urge to go to battle, I also realize with breathtaking selfishness that even more wars would be lost, and that on occasion we might be lost, if the Brads of the world decided to sit them out. Once again I have retreated -- or advanced -- to books. I suppose I hope that the world of imaginative literature I have grown so accustomed to inhabiting and through which my own horizons have been enlarged might provide the same rich vein for someone like Brad, who is trying to figure out nothing less than how to live his life.

HEADLINE: Balancing Bottom Lines and Headlines

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

 BODY:
St. Petersburg, Fla.
 DURING the next year or so, The St. Petersburg Times plans to continue pursuing deeply reported, long-term features about such topics as Florida's property insurance crisis, complex tax issues, public education at all levels, and wildlife and endangered species. It will balance this slate of stories against all the other bread-and-butter issues it covers everyday for its readers: politics, business, sports, community affairs, culture and more.
 ''We're going to invest the time and energy and the resources in these stories because the question we're always asking ourselves is what matters to our audience,'' said Stephen Buckley, the managing editor of the newspaper. ''And that's the question that really drives our organization: Are we doing work that matters?'' 
 Such ambitions were rare enough in the good old days of gumshoe journalism, when newspapers were cash machines. Now, as more readers and advertisers migrate to the Internet, this kind of enterprise reporting has become harder to find at many papers. And in that context, The St. Petersburg Times is itself an endangered species -- an independent, privately owned daily that continues to serve up quality journalism. Many owners of other daily city papers sold them off years ago to try to avoid inheritance taxes. But The St. Petersburg Times was not sold; to guarantee local ownership and independence, its owner, Nelson Poynter, gave it away upon his death in 1978 to a nonprofit educational organization now called the Poynter Institute. 
 For newspaper publishing -- an industry awash in uncertainty as it tries to adapt to the Internet -- The St. Petersburg Times offers one possible model for salvaging enterprises that must, as all businesses do, respond to financial reality. In contrast to some other businesses, newspapers also have to address technological change and economic shifts while carrying out their traditional mission of trying to provide independent, high-quality information and analysis to readers. 
 Interest in the St. Petersburg model has grown in the wake of Rupert Murdoch's recent agreement to acquire Dow Jones & Company, the publisher of The Wall Street Journal. That was just the latest in a wave of seismic changes that include plummeting stock prices for publicly owned newspaper companies (including The New York Times Company), the divestiture of the Knight Ridder chain and the cost-cutting that has ravaged newspapers like The Baltimore Sun, The Miami Herald, The Philadelphia Inquirer, The Courier-Journal of Louisville, Ky., and The Los Angeles Times.
 ''I think the St. Petersburg Times model is wonderful, and I think it would be great if there would be more of them,'' said John S. Carroll, a former top editor at The Los Angeles Times, who resigned after resisting staff cuts ordered by its owner, the Tribune Company. ''The value of newspapers is dropping so the financial sacrifice necessary to do this is becoming easier, and I think there is a lot of charitable money around, and there are some money people who are concerned about the future of journalism.''
 FOR their part, editors at The St. Petersburg Times say Mr. Poynter was a visionary whose act of singular munificence allows their reporters to do painstaking reporting because the paper doesn't answer to outside investors who constantly watch the bottom line. ''We don't put out a newspaper to make money,'' says Paul C. Tash, the chief executive of the Times Publishing Company, which oversees the paper. ''We make money so we can put out a great newspaper.''
 Mr. Poynter didn't make all his family members happy by giving away a fortune, but as he said, ''I haven't met my great-grandchildren, and I may not like them.'' While his legacy allows for patient, long-term investment, The St. Petersburg Times isn't free from the industry's challenges.
 The paper doesn't get any money from the Poynter Institute. Just like other private businesses, it pays for its operating expenses, $90 million this year for payroll alone, from its own revenue, and it pays taxes on its profits. It must also pay the Poynter Institute a yearly dividend, currently about $6 million, for which it receives no tax benefit. ''The Times Publishing Company has no tax advantages related to our ownership,'' said Jana Jones, the company's chief financial officer. 
 What makes the company different from most private companies is that the owner, the Poynter Institute, does not take money out of the company beyond the dividend. Every decision that is made at the newspaper with regard to the use of profits, executives say, is based on the reinvestment needs of the company. No owner or chain is removing that money to invest in another newspaper or another business.
 As a result, the paper does not need to push for lush profit margins that exceed 20 percent, a benchmark at some publicly owned newspaper chains. (In fact, its margin is now below its minimum target of 10 percent, according to the company.) Instead, it can spend money on big investigations and on innovative products that may hurt the bottom line in the short term but may pay off handsomely in the future. In short, the freedom from Wall Street's tyranny gives the paper more room to experiment.
 Still, editors at The Times, Florida's most widely circulated paper, say the business environment here is as tough as they have ever seen, especially with the local housing market crashing. And, like other papers, The Times is having to make sacrifices.
 But while most other papers are cutting back on their investigative reporting, The Times is increasing it. It has recently published exhaustive investigations of vanishing wetlands and overcrowding at the county jail. It still sends correspondents and photographers on expensive trips abroad to cover the Iraq war and political crises elsewhere, while also expanding coverage of local football games through Webcasts of highlights and reporter commentaries. A winner of six Pulitzer Prizes in its history, the paper has won three Ernie Pyle awards for human interest writing over the last four years and won the Raymond Clapper award for Washington reporting last year.
 For other papers to follow The Times's route, they will have to enlist the aid of deep-pocketed financiers with an affinity for information gathering -- a very small group. One of those financiers is Eli Broad, the billionaire philanthropist who made a recent, unsuccessful bid for the Tribune Company. ''You could create a nonprofit newspaper and have a number of foundations be contributors to the nonprofit,'' he said, describing a model that is somewhat similar but not identical to that of The St. Petersburg Times. 
 Current owners of newspapers, however, seem less than enthusiastic about giving away their family jewels. ''As altruistic as some families are, to say that you are going to take a very valuable enterprise and give up that value is something that just isn't going to happen,'' said Frank A. Blethen, whose family controls The Seattle Times.
 Others are equally skeptical. ''You have to have a private owner somewhere who has been in the business for a long time who decided they didn't have heirs or their heirs are going to get enough anyway,'' said Brian P. Tierney, who led a group that bought The Philadelphia Inquirer and Philadelphia Daily News last year. 
 But already, a handful of small newspapers have followed The Times's example, including The Anniston Star in Alabama and The New Hampshire Union Leader. Other newspaper owners have come calling to St. Petersburg, but Mr. Tash says that when he gets to the part about how Mr. Poynter gave the newspaper away, ''there is a long pause, and they usually say -- sometimes to the great relief of their children -- that's not going to work for us.'' 
 For all of the insulation The St. Petersburg Times enjoys, it, too, faces financial challenges. As a private company, the Times Publishing Company does not release profit numbers, but Mr. Tash said profits have been falling since 2001.
 The daily newspaper's average circulation dropped to 308,256 in 2006 from 334,336 in 2003; Sunday circulation decreased to 406,920 from 420,251 over the same period. But that is a softer decline than those at The Miami Herald and many other big-city dailies. Times managers say they expect single-digit increases this year for both the daily and Sunday editions, primarily because circulation in neighboring Tampa is booming after an intensive marketing effort. There, it faces tough competition from The Tampa Tribune.
 Advertising in The St. Petersburg Times is also suffering, with double-digit declines in auto, real estate and employment classifieds over the last year alone. Increased advertising in a new, free tabloid it publishes and on the Web have not made up the difference.
 The declines in revenue have brought sacrifices here as everywhere else in the business. The newsroom staff has been cut to about 360 from about 390, mainly by attrition, since January. The size of the paper was narrowed recently to save newsprint. Two pages were taken out of the Saturday business section by eliminating some stock tables. In Citrus County, north of the St. Petersburg area, the paper's bureau has been closed and the local edition has been eliminated. Obituaries beyond seven lines are no longer free. Selling obituaries made the obit pages advertising pages, preserving some space for news that otherwise would have been lost. 
 ''I don't see a eureka moment yet,'' Mr. Tash conceded. ''You have to keep the ball in play long enough until you see how you might win the game.''
 STAYING in the game also means generating new products that may seem alien to traditional Times readers. The company introduced a tabloid as a sassy, free weekly publication called tbt* in 2004 and converted it into a daily last year to attract young readers. Management says tbt* is about to eke out a profit. Now the company is preparing to start a new glossy lifestyle magazine called Bay, aimed at its wealthiest readers.
 The Times has also been aggressive online, reintroducing its Web site, tampabay.com, last year to attract a regional audience beyond St. Petersburg, and it has started many blogs covering issues as diverse as alternative energy and personal finance. The company reports that the average number of monthly visitors on the Web site has increased from 964,000 in 2005 to 1.3 million last year to 1.4 million in July. 
 In early August, editors teamed up with Congressional Quarterly to start PolitiFact.com, a sometimes cheeky look at the presidential candidates' claims, promises and attacks; the site has already touched off a buzz far outside of St. Petersburg's pristine marinas. 
 Staff members were added to the Web and tbt* operations, even as the paper's staff was cut -- a classic effort to take costs out of a declining product line and reinvest a portion of the savings in innovative products that might raise revenue. The investment last year in tbt* totaled $6.3 million, an amount the company believes that it will match this year. (The company declined to detail other financial commitments.)
 Managers at The Times say most newspapers are cutting costs but not using enough of their savings to innovate because of a short-term strategic horizon that Wall Street enforces. ''I think it is going to be very difficult, even harder, for newspapers that can't look past the quarter or this year to create something that may not help their bottom line in the short term,'' Mr. Tash said. 
 But will the efforts to pump up the Web and tabloid journalism really help guarantee quality journalism over the long haul? 
 For all of the emphasis on new media and amusement, editors here say the heart of the issue is how to deliver the most news to the most people as efficiently as possible in formats that correspond to their needs and tastes. In the end, the combination of sacrifice and new products is supposed to save the newspaper. 
 The other day, Neil Brown, the executive editor of The St. Petersburg Times, met with Christine Montgomery, managing editor of tampabay.com, and Richard Reeves, vice president for advertising and marketing at The Times, to consider how they might save the $250,000 it costs annually to deliver copies of The St. Petersburg Times to Tallahassee every day, a service that The Miami Herald and other Florida competitors have already given up. The operation requires two trucks and sells only 350 copies, for a mere $150 in daily circulation revenue. It looks like a ripe candidate for elimination in these tough times, but the editors do not want to disappoint their loyal Tallahassee readers. 
 As the three brainstormed, they kicked around various ideas about an electronic state edition with top political and business articles that would be aimed at a Brooks Brothers and Gucci audience in Tallahassee and other Florida cities. The edition could be e-mailed or set up on a separate Web site, possibly replacing the costly delivery operation. Or it could be such a moneymaker that no cost-cutting would be necessary. ''There's a 50 percent chance we can do this and keep delivering the papers,'' Mr. Reeves concluded, to the smiles of the others. 
 THAT would make reporters like Thomas French happy. He has spent years examining endangered species, alongside other tasks he juggles for The Times. He recently visited a local zoo to witness a 1,000-pound manatee being hauled into a truck so it could be released into the wild -- part of a lengthy series on the behavior of animals in zoos and the wild that he plans to get into the paper by the end of the year. 
 ''I don't know of any business plan where this kind of in-depth reporting makes sense, except for one that is built on a long-term goal of excellence,'' he said. ''I don't know how long they'll let me do this.''

HEADLINE: The Search for Holiday Help Starts Early

BYLINE: By LOUISE KRAMER

 BODY:
IN the human resources department at Tiffany & Company, the jewelry giant, it has been looking a lot like Christmas since the day after Memorial Day. 
 That is when the company started planning its strategy for attracting the temporary workers it needs come November to bolster its staff during the most important selling time of the year. Retailers post up to 40 percent of their sales in the last two months of the year, according to the National Retail Federation. 
 Linda Layne, manager of human resources for Tiffany's flagship store on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, said that there was a ''sense of urgency'' this year about finding good workers amid a tough recruitment environment. ''We are up against some competition, and we are all going after the same pool of candidates,'' she said. 
 Tiffany began running classified ads just after Labor Day, and held its annual New York job fair on Sept. 19, its earliest yet. The retailer was not alone. That same week, there were holiday job fairs in Manhattan for Saks Fifth Avenue, Fortunoff, Kenneth Cole and even Madison Square Garden, which was looking for security guards.
 Tiffany's flagship needs to fill 150 jobs for sales staff, cashiers, doormen, personal shoppers, wrappers and security officers, among others.
 ''We are not the only game in town, and we have to take that sense of urgency to our recruitment effort,'' Ms. Layne said. ''We have to get that candidate quicker and attract them better,'' she said. 
 New York job seekers have plenty of holiday opportunities this year, though with uncertainty in the economy, hiring may not be quite as robust as last year's strong showing, said James Brown, labor market analyst at the New York State Departmentnof Labor. Last year, New York City retailers added 20,000 workers for the holidays, he said. 
 New York's unemployment rate has averaged 5 percent so far this year, down from 8 percent in 2003. ''There is not going to be a significant pool of experienced unemployed retail workers available,'' Mr. Brown said. 
 The competition for workers is especially stiff at the high end. Merchants want employees who can do things like restock charm bracelets and at the same time display a soft touch with customers who expect to be coddled. They need to be able to work long hours and on weekends, often in an intense environment. Employers ''don't just want warm bodies,'' said Daniel Butler, vice president for merchandising and retail operations at the National Retail Federation. 
 For Tiffany, seasonal workers are crucial to holiday success, said Naomi Seckler, vice president for human resources. ''They need to make each person coming into Tiffany have a warm, gracious welcome and be able to make them enjoy the moment of purchasing and make it feel special,'' she said.
 To attract such plum employees, Tiffany started a Web site the day after Labor Day, tiffanyseasonaljobs.com, and has been contacting employees who worked last year, as well as individuals who expressed interest in Tiffany via various employment services and Web sites in the past year. 
 Holiday wages range from $12 to $17 an hour, depending on the position and an employee's experience. Sales clerks are eligible for commissions of 1 percent. Seasonal employees receive discounts, including 30 percent off at the company store. At the flagship, employees can use the on-site health service, which is run by a nurse, and participate in yoga classes. 
 The job fair is the main source of workers for the Manhattan store. About 30 percent will be hired. About 10 percent of those hired for the season will go onto permanent jobs, Ms. Layne said. 
 At this year's event, held at the Hilton New York, job seekers, most in the dressy business attire befitting Tiffany's luxury image, waited to be interviewed in a large room outfitted with 21 interview tables, some decorated with the company's signature blue shopping bags.
 HOLIDAY helpers tend to be students, retirees, people who are out of work and looking for a toehold in a new career, or full-time workers who want to supplement their income. This mix was reflected at the Hilton. Mary Ann Hart, 63, an East Village resident, is semiretired from the garment industry after 30 years. ''I am looking for a part-time job so I can pursue my original goal in life, to be a writer,'' she said. 
 Yana Zilbershteyn, 26, a Coney Island resident who works full time as a bank teller, said she was contemplating a switch into retailing. Corey Onario, 32, a Brooklyn resident who recently left a job as a customer service manager for a sightseeing company, wants a full-time job.
 ''I know that sometimes when you go for the seasonal things if they see how well you do, it can turn into something else more permanent for the future,'' he said.

HEADLINE: When the Best Deals Don't End in .Com

BYLINE: By MICHELLE HIGGINS

 BODY:
FOR a trip to Barcelona, Jorge Cuadros, a lawyer from Alexandria, Va., turned to the Internet to book a rental car. On Hertz.com, Mr. Cuadros was quoted a price of 626.12 euros for an automatic Mercedes for five days in October. At $1.42 to the euro, that amounted to about $890.
 Out of curiosity, Mr. Cuadros switched to his native Spanish tongue and checked Hertz's Spanish Web site, www.hertz.es, where the same car was offered for 263.92 euros -- about 58 percent less. He had stumbled upon a little-known trick that many online travel companies would rather keep quiet. 
 ''It seems that the car rental companies are in some cases even charging twice the price to residents of the U.S. than to Europeans,'' said Mr. Cuadros, who compares the practice to how some pharmaceutical companies charge more in the United States than they do overseas. ''This is abusive behavior.''
 Some of the best travel deals on the Web these days don't end in .com but can be found on a travel company's foreign offshoot, which usually ends with the country's domain name, like .fr (France), and .de (Germany). Though the travel companies don't advertise it, they often charge different prices based on the country of origin.
 In an effort to expand their global reach, online travel agencies based in the United States like Expedia and Travelocity, as well as individual airlines and car rental agencies, are creating Web sites geared to foreign counties. Travelocity, for example, just started Travelocity.com.mx for customers in Mexico. It also has Travelocity.co.uk for Britain; www.Travelocity.de for Germany; and Travelocity.ca for Canada. Expedia has 13 foreign sites including Expedia.dk (Denmark), Expedia.it (Italy) and Expedia.fr (France).
 The savings can be considerable. An Expedia.com search for a round-trip flight from Melbourne to Sydney in August yielded a $350 airfare on Qantas as the lowest available, including taxes and fees. The same flight was listed on Expedia's Australian Web site, Expedia.com.au, for 224.34 Australian dollars, or about $187 at 1.20 Australian dollars to the U.S. dollar. Expedia.com.au also listed a lower fare (about 200 Australian dollars) on Virgin Blue, an Australian low-cost carrier; the United States site did not search that airline. 
 On Budget.com, a recent search for a six-day rental in Dublin pulled up a two-door, economy car for 109 euros a day. The same search on Budget.ie, the company's Irish offshoot, offered the same category of car for 82 euros.
 Travel companies defend the multitiered pricing structure, saying that they set prices according to what each market will bear. ''For decades, the market where goods and services are purchased has been a pricing factor in the travel industry, car rental included,'' Paula R. Rivera, a public affairs manager at Hertz, wrote in an e-mail message. ''Costs and competitive conditions in individual markets are among the considerations that affect pricing.''
 Expedia said its travel suppliers dictate prices, but added that it negotiated different agreements in each country. ''Our Australian point-of-sale accesses domestic fares within Australia through a consolidator, giving the Australia site access to Virgin Blue, which we do not sell on Expedia.com in the U.S.,'' Katie Deines, a spokeswoman for Expedia, said in an e-mail message. But customers in the United States, she added, can't complete purchases on Expedia's Australian Web site unless their credit card billing address is based in that country. (Budget and Hertz do not have that restriction.) 
 ''The requirement is among the measures we take to ensure the validity and security of bookings made on our points-of-sale,'' Ms. Deines said.
 Some airlines do the same thing, and restrict purchases on their foreign Web sites to customers in those countries, said Keith Melnick, executive vice president of corporate development at Kayak.com and a former revenue manager at American Airlines. ''In airline speak,'' he wrote in an e-mail message, ''the airlines differentiate their pricing based on the point-of-sale (P.O.S.). However, it is generally not a good idea to start searching the site in these other countries since the ones that do differentiate pricing by P.O.S. don't want you to do this and will prevent you from purchasing by requiring a local credit card.'' 
 When this is the case, there are few work-arounds. If you are visiting friends in a foreign country, see if they can make a reservation for you. Likewise if you're traveling on business abroad, perhaps your company's foreign office can arrange your travel. You also might try contacting a travel agent in the area you're planning to visit and ask them to make the purchase for you. The savings may outweigh any fees charged by the agent for processing the transaction.
 While country-domain hopping may uncover deals for rental cars and domestic flights in those countries, it doesn't seem to work as well for hotel chains. ''The large chains like Marriott have implemented a single image inventory to ensure rate parity across all channels,'' said Ram Badrinathan, a Mumbai-based senior analyst at PhoCusWright, a travel consulting and research company. 
 Bargain hunters should also watch out for hidden fees. Car rental agencies may charge foreign customers more for liability coverage. Web sites often assume that you are a resident of that country when you book online, so the additional cost may not appear until you pick up the car.
 Also, the foreign spinoffs of airline travel sites may require that the trip originate from that country, making round-trip searches of little use to American travelers. Still, those sites may be useful if you're planning to travel within that country. A recent search on Kayak.com for the lowest airfare between Paris and Nice found a $171 fare on Air France. The same search on Kayak.fr turned up a 100-euro ticket on easyJet. 
 Those sites might also come in handy for finding a cheap side trip. A recent glance at Travelocity.co.uk highlighted four-star hotel offers in Rome starting at 48 euros a night and vacation packages in Krakow, Poland. Meanwhile, Travelocity.com was advertising deals in Florida, New York and Mexico. 
 So while searching the foreign version of a travel Web site might not always lead to the lowest price, it might just lead you to a destination you never would have thought to visit.

HEADLINE: Once Again We're Driving What's Not Made Here

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
NOW that the Big Three automakers are shrinking their labor costs -- removing what they have so frequently described as the biggest obstacle to selling more cars in this country -- they should be able to regain market share. Right?
 Well, not exactly. The game has changed. The foreign companies against whom the Big Three compete are selling more and more cars that are not made at their factories in the United States, making labor costs here less important. They are importing again -- in fact, quietly importing almost as many cars as they did in the 1980's when Japanese vehicles flooded the market, provoking an outcry, and also import quotas. 
 Back then, the Japanese responded by putting factories in the United States. ''Transplants,'' they were called. So did the Germans and other Europeans and, most recently, the South Koreans. They are all still building factories here, expanding ''domestic'' production and paying their nonunion labor $25 to $30 an hour less in wages and benefits than the Big Three's workers.
 The Big Three for years have blamed that cost disadvantage for their sinking market share in the United States. Their cars were too expensive to make, they said. The tentative contract that General Motors negotiated with the United Auto Workers last week would lower the cost spread by shifting retiree health insurance obligations to a stand-alone trust fund administered by the U.A.W. and by lowering the wage scale for new hires. 
 But imports are once again rising, and the message is that shrinking labor costs within the United States won't be enough. In a global economy, there are too many ways to gain market share. Marketing Toyota's hybrid Prius, made only in Japan, as a fuel-efficient, ecologically friendly vehicle is one example. 
 ''I don't think anyone at Ford, Chrysler or General Motors believes their own rhetoric that they are going to gain market share just by reducing their labor costs,'' said Daniel Luria, an economist at the Michigan Manufacturing Technology Center in Ann Arbor, Mich. ''What they are trying to do is reduce their labor costs in a new U.A.W. contract while at the same time import more cars'' -- but their own. 
 The foreign auto companies are already well ahead on that score. Imported vehicles -- coming now especially from Japan, Germany and South Korea -- accounted for 23.4 percent of the vehicles sold in the United States this year through August, according to a compilation of government data by Moody's Economy.com. 
 That has risen gradually from 11 percent in 1996. The numbers don't include imports from Mexico and Canada, considered part of the domestic North American market. Even so, the import share is approaching the high of 27 percent in 1987. But this time, in sharp contrast to the Japan bashing of the Reagan years, there is silence.
 ''When you get outside Ohio, Michigan and Indiana, I don't think there is any real view anymore of what is American and what isn't,'' Mr. Luria said. ''Most people would say that most Toyotas, Hondas and Nissans are made here. The idea that the Big Three are American and the others are foreign, that is less and less meaningful.''
 The Big Three seem to be absorbing that view. They struggled in the 1980s to get the foreign manufacturers to locate in the United States, thinking initially that it would be easier to compete with them here. But now Chrysler and General Motors are already either importing vehicles from Europe, China and Australia for sale as American models, or arranging to do so, making labor costs at home less relevant. 
 Such trends do not sit well with Alan Tonelson, a research fellow at the United States Business and Industry Council, which favors tariffs. He argues that the Big Three lift the rest of the national economy more than the transplants do. Specifically, he says, nearly every study shows that vehicles manufactured here by G.M., Ford and Chrysler contain a ''considerably higher'' percentage of American-made parts than cars rolling off the lines at the transplants. 
 Senator Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat, is also vexed. Citing Census Bureau data and his staff's calculations, Mr. Levin argues that ''immense barriers'' erected by Japan and South Korea keep down vehicle exports from the United States to those countries. Car, truck and parts imports from Japan, for example, reached $60.2 billion last year, he said, while similar exports to Japan from the United States were a tiny $2.3 billion. He put the Korean imbalance at $12.4 billion versus $751 million.
 ''What we should do with Korea is insist that the free trade agreement guarantees openness in their markets,'' he said of the pact signed by the countries last June and now before Congress. ''This agreement does not do that.'' 
 Apart from trade issues, other factors are lifting vehicle imports. The Japanese are the leaders at making smaller, fuel-efficient cars in their home factories -- and that is paying off at a moment when $3-a-gallon gasoline is raising the popularity of such cars here. 
 Some argue that the rise in imports, especially small cars, is a natural market response to that demand. ''The transplants are generally large-car plants,'' said James Doyle, president of Level Field Institute, a research group partly financed by American automakers. ''So even a Toyota or Hyundai can't make small cars profitably in the United States.''
 Largly because of the Prius, Toyota is turning out to be the biggest single importer so far this year, accounting for roughly one in every five vehicles coming into the country. Although the Japanese company is adding factories in the United States, 45.7 percent of its vehicles sold here through August were imported, up from 40 percent in 2003.
 Trina Ewald, a spokeswoman for Toyota Motors North America, says the company has no choice. ''We are operating our North American plants at full capacity,'' she said. ''We are building as many vehicles as we can locally.'' 
 That is not true in Japan, where Toyota and other auto manufacturers have built new factories, only to find that domestic sales are not enough to keep them operating at full capacity. Exports have helped to do this. So has the weak yen -- weak for most of this decade, reducing the cost of production, measured in dollars, and thus the profitability of exports to the United States.

HEADLINE: Paralysis on Affordable Housing

 BODY:
One of the mysteries of the Corzine administration is how little progress has been made in building affordable housing. 
 Time after time, Gov. Jon Corzine has stated his enthusiastic support for the concept of providing housing that families of modest incomes can afford, and that New Jersey clearly needs. But the actions of his own administration have done much to keep that from happening. 
 Foremost was Mr. Corzine's failure to immediately replace Susan Bass Levin as head of the Department of Community Affairs, which has the major say about affordable housing. As mayor of the South Jersey suburb of Cherry Hill, Ms. Levin fought affordable housing requirements, and advocates believe she never really changed her views after taking the state job.
 And then the state continued its virtual exemption of affordable housing requirements for both the New Jersey Meadowlands Commission, which governs that huge tract of land, and the Xanadu entertainment and shopping complex, which is being built in the Meadowlands. Last spring, a court struck down a major part of that exemption, and the Meadowlands Commission has moved to require affordable housing in many of the area's development projects. 
 Now, there is some prospect of greater progress. Mr. Corzine announced this month that State Senator Joseph Doria Jr., a Democrat from Hudson County, was his choice to replace Ms. Levin, who has been moved to a top job with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. While not exactly a past champion of affordable housing requirements, Mr. Doria has not opposed them either. In private meetings just before Mr. Corzine's announcement, he assured housing advocates that he realized the need for more modest-priced housing in the state.
 Besides his long career in the Legislature -- he was once the speaker of the Assembly -- Mr. Doria is the mayor of Bayonne, where he no doubt saw firsthand the shortage of housing in New Jersey. On the downside, he is the ultimate pol, comfortable with many of the cozy dealings in Trenton and Hudson County. (He will have to resign as senator and mayor before starting as community affairs commissioner.) 
 But he also has great potential to improve the relationship between the Legislature, where he has friends in both parties, and the governor, many of whose top appointees come from business and lack much feel for New Jersey politics. 
 Numerous economists have pointed out that a key in reviving New Jersey's sluggish economy is building new homes that workers can afford to buy. Unless that happens, many businesses and the jobs they provide will locate elsewhere. We hope that Mr. Doria, who is expected to be confirmed by the State Senate, will use the political skill he has developed over his many years in government to see that more affordable housing gets built.

HEADLINE: Brooklyn's Fragile Ego-System

BYLINE: By ALEX WILLIAMS

 BODY:
IT wasn't supposed to matter to Brooklyn. Heath Ledger, the crown prince of the borough's celebrity aristocracy, apparently fled his fiefdom in Boerum Hill for Manhattan after splitting up with his girlfriend, the actress Michelle Williams.
 ''To each his own,'' said Jay Wilkinson, 29, an actor who lives in the neighborhood, speaking just blocks from the house on Dean Street where Mr. Ledger had lived since 2005 with Ms. Williams and their daughter, Matilda. He echoed a theme expressed by many on blogs and in the streets after the breakup. We barely notice the stars among us. If we lose one, no big deal. 
 In that, though, lies a tale of arriviste anxiety. What if Brooklyn's recent cachet as the locus for what's next is little more than a thin and fragile crust of chic, hiding the insecurity of people who constantly measure the social currency of their ZIP code by Manhattan standards? 
 The number of trendy boutiques, bistros and music clubs in Brooklyn may have spiked in the last five years, but its infrastructure of cool still represents only a fraction of that found in Manhattan. Its new identity is moored to a finite number of shops, restaurants, luxury condominiums and, yes, celebrities. If even one leaves, a void is created. Could the borough's new status vanish as quickly as it ascended?
 In recent years, Brooklyn's pool of second-tier celebrity mascots (John Turturro, Rosie Perez, Norman Mailer, Steve Buscemi) has swollen and taken on a level of movie-star glamour, thanks to recent home buyers like Jennifer Connelly and her husband, Paul Bettany, Adrian Grenier and Maggie Gyllenhaal and Peter Sarsgaard. 
 These famous names, functioning as both symbols and selling points for the new Brooklyn, helped drive up property values, provided a focus for gossip in coffeehouses and dog runs, and instilled pride among the tide of newcomers who arrived -- sort of by choice -- from Manhattan and beyond.
 ''The dark secret of Brooklyn is that many of the people who are going there are going there because they can't afford Manhattan,'' said Douglas Rushkoff, a writer and former Park Slope resident. ''There is a tension between people who are in Brooklyn for Brooklyn's sake, for the diversity and the quality of life, and people who are pushed to Brooklyn unwillingly.''
 The latter, he said, ''use a single restaurant, or a celebrity-and-a-half, as their justification as to why it's O.K. If one moves out, it's a big deal.'' 
 THE journalist and novelist Kurt Andersen, who lives nearby, said that the thousands of trend-conscious types who moved to Brooklyn in recent years have cultivated an extra layer of snobbery, maintaining not just the old New York indifference toward stars in their midst, but overlaying it with indie earnestness.
 ''There's an alterna-Brooklyn, 'We're cool cats' attitude that probably reinforces that obligatory nonchalance,'' he said. ''There's a part of me that thinks, in my smug, self-flattering way, that Heath Ledger must be a really cool guy if he lives here with me.''
 But, he added, ''if you happen to be eating on Smith Street and Heath Ledger walks in, who doesn't glance?'' For years, Boerum Hill was a charming, if lightly trafficked, stretch of brownstone-lined streets (and housing projects) tucked between Brooklyn Heights and Park Slope. Even many Manhattanites had never heard of it before 2005. 
 But post-Heath, Boerum Hill was suddenly worthy of international mention. ''Over the past year, the 'Brokeback Mountain' stars have become a familiar sight in Boerum Hill,'' The Daily Telegraph of Sydney, Australia, wrote in February 2006. ''Locals say they often see Ledger on his skateboard or walking to local cafes with Williams and their baby daughter Matilda.'' 
 They became ''Mr. and Mrs. Brooklyn,'' said Dana Atherton, 26, a clerk at the Brooklyn Industries store on Smith Street, itself an emblem of the borough's new identity. 
 As residents began to use cute, Manhattan-ish real estate acronyms like BoCoCa (referring to greater Boerum Hill, Cobble Hill and Carroll Gardens) and, more playfully, NoGo (north Gowanus), Lucky jeans opened a shop on Smith Street, just down from American Apparel. ''We always had old-timers and trendy couples,'' said Lucinda Rosenfeld, a novelist who lives in Boerum Hill. ''But the cute young girls on vintage Schwinns are definitely a new development.'' 
 Celebrities contribute more than just luster to a neighborhood, said Roslyn Huebener, a founder of the Brooklyn real estate agency Aguayo & Huebener. Brokers, she said, routinely name-drop when taking skeptical clients on tours of economically emerging neighborhoods. 
 ''It's very reassuring,'' she said. ''Let's say you're going out to buy a condo or house, you think, 'Oh my God, should I be paying that kind of money?' But when you know these people are there, it validates that the value is going to continue.'' 
 No wonder, then, that some residents sound a bit defensive over the implication that their neighborhood's identity might be tenuously tied to a couple of movie stars. 
 ''I don't think it's that big a deal,'' said Mark Kincaid, a manager of Flight 001, a hip travel-oriented boutique in Boerum Hill, referring to Mr. Ledger's departure. He added, ''a lot of people live in the neighborhood -- people in the fashion industry, actors, editors. We just had Jonathan Hyde from 'King Lear' in yesterday.''
 Other residents mentioned the presence of actors like Hope Davis, Emily Mortimer and her husband, Alessandro Nivola, as a hedge against any image depreciation.
 But after gossip blogs speculated whether the neighborhood was over and ran photographs of a moving van -- from Celebrity Moving, no less -- parked by the couple's wasabi-green house on Dean Street, some acknowledged that the locals would have to find a new sport in lieu of Heath-spotting. 
 ''It's like being in Kruger National Park,'' Mr. Andersen said, referring to the South African game preserve, ''and knowing there are only seven black rhinos.
 ''If you've seen one,'' he said, ''you've seen it.''

HEADLINE: Is Hillary Clinton the New Old Al Gore?

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
THE Democrats can't lose the White House in 2008, can they?
 Some 13 months before Election Day, the race's dynamic seems immutable. Americans can't wait to evict the unpopular president and end his disastrous war. As the campaign's poll-tested phrasemaking constantly reminds us, voters crave change above all else. That means nearly any Democrat might do, even if the nominee isn't the first woman, black or Hispanic to lead a major party's ticket. 
 The Republican field of aging white guys, meanwhile, gets flakier by the day. The front-runner has taken to cooing to his third wife over a cellphone in the middle of campaign speeches. His hottest challenger, the new ''new Reagan,'' may have learned his lines for ''Law & Order,'' but clearly needs cue cards on the stump. In Florida, even the most rudimentary details of red-hot local issues (drilling in the Everglades, Terri Schiavo) eluded him. The party's fund-raising is anemic. Its snubs of Hispanic and African-American voters kissed off essential swing states in the Sun Belt and moderate swing voters farther north.
 So nothing can go wrong for the Democrats. Can it? 
 Of course it can, and not just because of the party's perennial penchant for cutting off its nose to spite its face. (Witness the Democratic National Committee's zeal in shutting down primary campaigning in Florida because the state moved up the primary's date.) The biggest indicator of potential trouble ahead is that the already-codified Beltway narrative for the race so favors the Democrats. Given the track record of Washington's conventional wisdom, that's not good news. These are the same political pros who predicted that scandal would force an early end to the Clinton presidency and that ''Mission Accomplished'' augured victory in Iraq and long-lasting Republican rule.
 The Beltway's narrative has it not only that the Democrats are shoo-ins, but also that the likely standard-bearer, Hillary Clinton, is running what Zagat shorthand might describe as a ''flawless campaign'' that is ''tightly disciplined'' and ''doesn't make mistakes.'' This scenario was made official last weekend, when Senator Clinton appeared on all fivemajorSundaymorningtalk shows -- a publicity coup, as it unfortunately happens, that is known as a ''full Ginsburg'' because it was first achieved by William Ginsburg, Monica Lewinsky's lawyer, in 1998.
 Mrs. Clinton was in complete control. Forsaking TV studios for a perfectly lighted set at her home in Chappaqua, she came off like a sitting head of state. The punditocracy raved. We are repeatedly told that with Barack Obama still trailing by double digits in most polls, the only way Mrs. Clinton could lose her tight hold on the nomination and, presumably, the White House would be if she were bruised in Iowa (where both John Edwards and Senator Obama remain competitive) or derailed by unforeseeable events like a scandal or a domestic terror attack. 
 If you buy into the Washington logic that a flawless campaign is one that doesn't make gaffes, never goes off-message and never makes news, then this analysis makes sense. The Clinton machine runs as smoothly and efficiently as a Rolls. And like a fine car, it is just as likely to lull its driver into complacent coasting and its passengers to sleep. What I saw on television last Sunday was the incipient second coming of the can't-miss 2000 campaign of Al Gore.
 That Mr. Gore, some may recall, was not the firebrand who emerged from defeat, speaking up early against the Iraq war and leading the international charge on global warming. It was instead the cautious Gore whose public persona changed from debate to debate and whose answers were often long-winded and equivocal (even about the Kansas Board of Education's decision to ban the teaching of evolution). Incredibly, he minimized both his environmental passions and his own administration's achievements throughout the campaign.
 He, too, had initially been deemed a winner, the potential recipient of a landslide rather than a narrow popular-vote majority. The signs were nearly as good for Democrats then as they are now. The impeachment crusade had backfired on the Republicans in the 1998 midterms; the economy was booming; Mr. Gore's opponent was seen as a lightweight who couldn't match him in articulateness or his mastery of policy, let alone his eight years of Clinton White House experience.
 Mrs. Clinton wouldn't repeat Mr. Gore's foolhardy mistake of running away from her popular husband and his record, even if she could. But almost every answer she gave last Sunday was a rambling and often tedious Gore-like filibuster. Like the former vice president, she often came across as a pontificator and an automaton -- in contrast to the personable and humorous person she is known to be off-camera. And she seemed especially evasive when dealing with questions requiring human reflection instead of wonkery. 
 Reiterating that Mrs. Clinton had more firsthand White House experience than any other candidate, George Stephanopoulous asked her to name ''something that you don't know that only a president can know.'' That's hardly a tough or trick question, but rather than concede she isn't all-knowing or depart from her script, the senator deflected it with another mini-speech.
 Then there was that laugh. The Clinton campaign's method for heeding the perennial complaints that its candidate comes across as too calculating and controlled is to periodically toss in a smidgen of what it deems personality. But these touches of intimacy seem even more calculating: the ''Let's chat'' campaign rollout, the ostensibly freewheeling but tightly controlled Web ''conversations,'' the supposed vox populi referendum to choose a campaign song (which yielded a plain-vanilla Celine Dion clunker). 
 Now Mrs. Clinton is erupting in a laugh with all the spontaneity of an alarm clock buzzer. Mocking this tic last week, ''The Daily Show'' imagined a robotic voice inside the candidate's head saying, ''Humorous remark detected -- prepare for laughter display.'' However sincere, this humanizing touch seems as clumsily stage-managed as the Gores' dramatic convention kiss. 
 None of this would matter if the only issue were Mrs. Clinton's ability as a performer. Not every president can be Reagan or J.F.K. or, for that matter, Bill Clinton. But in her case, as in Mr. Gore's in 2000, the performance too often dovetails with the biggest question about her as a leader: Is she so eager to be all things to all people, so reluctant to offend anyone, that we never will learn what she really thinks or how she will really act as president? 
 So far her post-first-lady record suggests a follower rather than a leader. She still can't offer a credible explanation of why she gave President Bush the authority to go to war in Iraq (or why she voted against the Levin amendment that would have put on some diplomatic brakes). That's because her votes had more to do with hedging her political bets than with principle. Nor has she explained why it took her two years of the war going south to start speaking up against it. She was similarly tardy with her new health care plan, waiting to see what heat Mr. Edwards and Senator Obama took with theirs. She has lagged behind the Democratic curve on issues ranging from the profound (calling for an unequivocal ban on torture) to the trivial (formulating a response to the MoveOn.org Petraeus ad).
 As was proved again in Wednesday night's debate, her opponents have not yet figured out how to seriously challenge her. Now the story line of her inevitable triumph is gathering force. At the same time, her campaign works relentlessly to shut down legitimate journalistic vetting of her record. In the latest example, Politico.com reported last week on the murky backstage machinations by the Clinton camp before the magazine GQ killed an article by Joshua Green, whose 2006 Atlantic Monthly profile judged Mrs. Clinton a practitioner of ''systematic caution'' with ''no big ideas.'' The donors' list and first lady archives at the Clinton presidential library remain far from transparent. 
 Senator Clinton may well be the Democrats' most accomplished would-be president. But we won't know for certain until she's tested by events she can't control. Had Bill Bradley roughed up Mr. Gore in 2000, it might have jolted him into running a smarter race against George W. Bush. 
 In this context it's worth noting that Mr. Bush's desperate lame-duck campaign to brand himself as a reincarnation of Harry Truman is not 100 percent ludicrous. A tiny part of the analogy could yet pan out. In 1948, Washington's commentators and pollsters were convinced that Americans, tired of 15 years of Democratic rule, would vote in a Republican. Like today's G.O.P., the Democrats back then were saddled with both an unloved incumbent president and open divisions in the party's ranks on both its left and right flanks. Surely, the thinking went, the beleaguered Democrats couldn't possibly vanquish a presidential candidate from New York known for his experience, competence, uncontroversial stands and above-the-fray demeanor. 
 You don't want to push historical analogies too far, but it's hard not to add that the campaign slogan of that sure winner, Thomas Dewey, had a certain 2008 ring to it: ''It's time for a change.''

HEADLINE: Can These Mortgages Be Saved?

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
ON Christmas Eve two years ago, as Shannon Rivas-Spivey wrapped gifts for her two young sons, she was interrupted by a knock at her door. Standing on her front steps in Somers Point, N.J., was a man from the Atlantic County sheriff's office, delivering foreclosure papers on the three-bedroom home that she and her fiance, Harold Spivey, had owned for almost 10 years.
 The visit was unwelcome, but not a surprise. Ms. Rivas-Spivey had been battling foreclosure for over a month, ever since the Countrywide Financial Corporation , the huge lender that services her loan, charged her escrow account for flood insurance she did not need and could not afford to pay. During the months it took to have Countrywide fix the error, she said, she fell behind on the loan.
 Now the sheriff's office had come calling. ''It totally destroyed our Christmas,'' she said. ''I feel like a failure. I let my sons down, I let my dogs down. It's senseless.'' 
 There are two sides to every story, of course. Countrywide disputes Ms. Rivas-Spivey's contention that billing her for unnecessary flood insurance essentially forced her into foreclosure. It said it has worked extensively with her to rescue her loan from default but that its efforts have failed. 
 Such painful, personal and financially damaging tugs of war between lenders and borrowers are likely to continue for quite some time. As the home mortgage boom of recent years continues to deflate, hundreds of thousands of borrowers are facing escalating monthly bills on adjustable-rate loans that are either in foreclosure or near it. In August, according to RealtyTrac, a home loan database, foreclosure filings across the country -- default notices, auction sales notices and bank repossessions -- soared to almost 244,000, up 36 percent from the previous month and more than double the number in August 2006.
 Lenders, government officials and loan servicers, who take in borrowers' monthly mortgage payments, contend that troubled borrowers everywhere are being helped to stay in their homes by those overseeing their loans. But neither data nor anecdotal evidence supports this view. A recent survey of 16 top subprime loan servicers by Moody's Investors Service found that for the first six months of 2007, an average of only 1 percent of loans experiencing an interest rate adjustment, or reset, had been modified. 
 Moody's did not identify the servicers it surveyed. But borrower advocates who work with a broad array of lenders say that none make it harder to modify loans than Countrywide, the nation's largest mortgage originator and loan servicer. Countrywide deploys a 2,700-member unit, called the HOPE Team, that it says helps borrowers modify their loans and hold onto their homes. HOPE is an acronym for ''Helping homeowners, Offering solutions, Preventing foreclosures and Envisioning success,'' but some Countrywide borrowers say the company's practices have left them hopeless.
 According to a dozen borrowers interviewed for this article, and thousands more who are working with borrowers' advocates, it is often difficult for homeowners to reach HOPE staff members. When they do, these people said, they encounter hostility and are charged large and unexplained fees throughout the foreclosure process -- whether or not they wind up keeping their homes. 
 ''Countrywide is trying to say they are doing workouts, but they are doing them with as little financial sacrifice for the company and as little effort as they can,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York and a member of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs. ''They are trying to get away with doing a good job here when you can prove by digging even a half an inch deeper that they're not.''
 Countrywide strongly disagrees. Last week, it described its efforts on behalf of troubled homeowners. ''Our No. 1 priority is to help borrowers stay in their homes,'' said Steve Bailey, a Countrywide executive, in a news release. The company said it has saved 39,582 mortgages from foreclosure so far this year. 
 But according to Countrywide's own data, it currently services almost nine million mortgages, with a value of $1.45 trillion. Of those, roughly 450,000 are delinquent. So providing home preservation assistance on the 39,582 loans amounts to just 8.8 percent of Countrywide borrowers who have fallen behind. 
 Even so, the workouts that Countrywide boasted about last week include two types of deals that wind up forcing borrowers from their homes. Almost 14 percent of its homeownership preservation efforts involved borrowers who agreed to sell their homes for less than their loan amounts, called a short sale, or involved homeowners turning over their deeds to Countrywide to prevent a foreclosure. Countrywide did not disclose in its news release that such arrangements were included in its workout figures.
 ''When you look under the surface, they are counting deeds-in-lieu as a modification,'' said Martin Eakes, chief executive of the Center for Responsible Lending, a nonprofit and nonpartisan research organization. ''When you've taken someone's house, even without the foreclosure process, to count that as a modification is worse than fiction.''
 Mr. Bailey conceded that some might take that view but said in an interview, ''At the end of the day, foreclosure avoidance is the theme we're going after.''
 AS the nation's largest lender and loan servicer, Countrywide finds itself in the middle of the mortgage storm and a target of borrower anger. In August, it reported that delinquencies in its servicing portfolio stood at 4.9 percent of its total outstanding loan amounts, up from 3.65 percent at the same time last year. 
 Foreclosures are not far behind. Expressed as a percentage of the loans' unpaid principal balances, they jumped to 1.2 percent in August from 0.48 percent a year earlier. Foreclosures pending as a percentage of total loans increased to 0.89 percent in August, up from 0.50 percent a year earlier.
 To be sure, customers who borrowed from many lenders other than Countrywide are also experiencing difficulties with their loans. But because Countrywide was one of the most aggressive purveyors of adjustable-rate loans -- the kind with interest rates that rise significantly after a low, two- or three-year teaser rate expires -- it is not surprising, borrower advocates say, that overall problem mortgages are ratcheting up. The Mortgage Bankers Association said that adjustable-rate mortgages to subprime borrowers accounted for 44 percent of all new foreclosures in the second quarter of this year.
 Even as Countrywide maintains that helping its borrowers modify their loans is its top priority, its investors have heard a slightly different story. In a conference call with analysts and investors in late July, Kevin Bartlett, Countrywide's chief investment officer, counted about 2,000 loan modifications done in June. Most of those, he said, involved deferring overdue interest or adding the past due amount to a loan. The company rarely provides workouts that reduce interest rates on loans, Mr. Bartlett told investors.
 Yet reducing rocketing interest rates is exactly the relief that many borrowers are seeking because, consumer advocates say, that is the only way they can afford to stay in their homes. Loan experts say that when workouts involve deferring overdue interest or tacking amounts owed onto the back of a loan, borrowers often wind up in trouble again in just a few years. 
 Mr. Bailey said that while Countrywide has historically done few interest rate reductions, it will be doing more. ''Right now we have just about 1,000 loans facing interest rate reductions,'' he said. ''The pendulum is swinging that way.'' 
 But Mark Seifert, executive director of Empowering and Strengthening Ohio's People, a consumer advocacy group in Cleveland, is dubious. He said his experience with Countrywide, one of the dozen or so lenders and servicers with whom he works on behalf of borrowers, has been unsatisfactory. 
 For the first eight months of this year, he said, his group took in 132 cases in which Countrywide was the loan servicer. Of those, two ended up in what he called ''very good'' workouts from the company. One involved forged documents when the original loan was made, Mr. Seifert said, and the other involved a borrower who received her deal from Countrywide the day before she was set to testify before Congress last July about her problems with the company. 
 ''We have experience with Citi, Chase and a whole litany of other lenders,'' Mr. Seifert said. ''Some are better than others, but we are successful more than half the time with all of them. Except Countrywide.'' 
 Mr. Bailey said the views of Mr. Seifert and others reflected the fact that they were dealing with borrowers in duress. ''We have had a lot of conversations with them and they don't like the answer we've given them,'' he said. ''By the time the activist groups get involved in our loans, usually they are dealing with situations that are a little more grim.'' 
 Lenders in general, and Countrywide in particular, say that they have no incentive to let a home go into foreclosure because all parties -- homeowners and those who hold their loans -- typically lose money in a distress sale. A 2003 Federal Reserve study found that estimated losses on foreclosures range from 30 percent to 60 percent of the outstanding loan balance, as a result of legal fees, lost interest payments and property costs. Countrywide said it incurred $600 million in losses on loans it holds in the first six months of 2007.
 But on the billions of dollars worth of mortgage loans that have been sold to investors in the last few years, it is not the banks or lenders like Countrywide that are hit with big losses when homes go into foreclosure. It is the sea of faceless investors who own pieces of these trusts. Also, under the trusts' pooling and servicing agreements, Countrywide and other servicers typically recoup any costs they cover in the foreclosure process, such as legal and appraisal fees.
 Borrower advocates fear that fees imposed during periods of delinquency and even foreclosure can offset losses that lenders and servicers incur. Few borrowers know, for example, that when they make only partial payments on their mortgages, servicers do not credit those payments against the principal or interest on their loan. Instead, the partial payments are deposited into a so-called suspense account. Servicers can dip into these funds and make use of them as interest-free loans, although the funds have to be accessible when the borrower becomes current on payments. In the meantime, borrowers -- whether or not they know it -- are still zapped with fees and charges for delinquent mortgage payments. 
 ''The foreclosure process is a profit opportunity for servicers and lenders, but there is very little oversight of the fees imposed,'' said Michael D. Calhoun, president of the Center for Responsible Lending. ''There are a lot of folks trying to squeeze distressed borrowers.''
 JANE CONNOR, a Countrywide borrower who is a writing instructor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, certainly feels squeezed. In March, she says, she was forced from her Arlington, Mass., home, a three-story Victorian she bought in 1998 for $298,000. She fell behind on her mortgage in early 2006 after her husband lost his job and she learned she had breast cancer. Fremont General, a financial services concern, originated her adjustable-rate loan but Countrywide now services it. 
 Ms. Connor said her interest rate was around 11 percent and her monthly payments about $5,200 when she fell behind. In April 2006, with the principal balance on her loan at $442,645, because of a refinancing, she got a deal from Countrywide to pay around $5,000 in cash each month, payments she made on time in May, June and July of last year. But she says she was two days late in August, and Countrywide refused her payment. 
 ''They told me I was $26,000 in arrears when I started making the payments,'' she said. ''But they didn't accept the cash payment in August and when I called to ask about the problem, they said I had forfeited the workout arrangement by being two days late.'' 
 At that point, Countrywide said Ms. Connor was behind by $43,000, nearly $20,000 more than she was a few months earlier. She said she did not understand why the figure had grown so fast in such a short time. A look at her documents shows how quickly the owed amount can rise, thanks to fees and unpaid interest. 
 In April 2007, for example, a payoff demand statement that Countrywide forwarded to Ms. Connor showed accrued interest on her loan totaling $64,105.13. Line items identified only as ''fees due'' and ''additional fees and costs'' totaled another $8,525. The statement shows that the total amount due to release the lien Countrywide held on Ms. Connor's property was $520,649 -- up from $442,634 when she went into delinquency almost exactly a year earlier. 
 The debt keeps mounting. By last week, her total amount due was $551,093. Since February 2006, she had accumulated added interest of $88,204 and nebulous ''fees'' of almost $11,000. 
 Mr. Bailey of Countrywide described the bulk of the fees as charges for legal work and other foreclosure expenses that are reimbursed to outside vendors. But some of the fees go to Countrywide units that provide title, appraisal and other services. 
 Still, Countrywide tried to extract other money from Ms. Connor. Last July, a few days before her house was to go on the auction block, she said she asked Countrywide for a delay so that a potential buyer who was willing to pay more than the company was owed could buy the home. The buyer was willing to close on the purchase in two weeks, without a home inspection. 
 Countrywide agreed to delay the auction for 30 days but only if she wired $5,900 in cash within a few days, Ms. Connor said. Countrywide said that the investor who holds her loan had asked for the payment. Although she refused to make it, Countrywide still delayed the auction.
 Countrywide said it would not allow Ms. Connor to sell the home for $550,000 because it would also be forced to pay off a $25,000 home equity loan that Ms. Connor's credit union holds on the property. She said Countrywide told her it would initially pay only $1,000 of the equity loan because its investors do not like to see it paying out money to another financial institution when a foreclosed house is sold.
 Countrywide later increased the amount it would offer to the credit union to $3,500. Last week, after a reporter began asking about Ms. Connor's situation, it raised that amount to $5,000.
 Mr. Bailey of Countrywide said the problem is persuading the credit union to agree to take less than it is owed. ''Jane Connor is frustrated that we are not agreeing to a short sale,'' he said. ''We would love for it to happen.'' 
 But Ms. Connor said that navigating the Countrywide maze has been exasperating. Poring over her last three months of phone bills, she identified about 670 calls relating to her home foreclosure, most of them messages left with Countrywide. She said that last July, when she first began asking Countrywide to agree to a sale, she and her lawyer had to speak with 14 different people at the company -- and received nine different answers about how best to proceed.
 Countrywide says that because its HOPE Team is so large, communications problems will inevitably emerge. ''With 2,700 employees, there are times when one of those employees wasn't as responsive as they should have been,'' Mr. Bailey said. ''We have gotten good at managing; we are not at all difficult to contact.'' He said that in August, Countrywide made 10.5 million attempts to reach delinquent borrowers.
 Late last week, Countrywide stepped up its efforts to allow Ms. Connor's sale to go through. Under the terms of the sale, which had not gone through as of Friday, both real estate agents agreed to cut their commissions. Countrywide would get almost all that it is owed.
 BRUCE MARKS is founder of the Neighborhood Assistance Corporation of America, a nonprofit advocacy and mortgage company that helps troubled borrowers get new, low-cost loans. He sees problem mortgages from across the country and works with a variety of lenders. He said that his organization has resolved 3,500 cases for imperiled borrowers this year, and that none have had to leave their homes. 
 Mr. Marks, too, characterizes Countrywide as the lender most unwilling to help borrowers.
 ''Homeowners who are desperate to keep their homes are trying to restructure the mortgages to the payment before the rates reset,'' he said. ''Countrywide demands their last dollar and their retirement funds to stop a foreclosure on unaffordable loans.'' 
 Ms. Rivas-Spivey said she was particularly disturbed that Countrywide's flood insurance error helped push her into trouble. Her woes began when Countrywide took over her loan two years ago. It billed her escrow account to cover the unneeded flood insurance as well as the tax payments that she said she was making separately. She didn't know that she was behind on her mortgage, she said, until Countrywide refused her November payment. By then, she was also in foreclosure. 
 Reaching anyone at Countrywide to help fix the problem was difficult, she recalled. When she did, she said, the company insisted that insurance was required on her property because of a recent change in the flood insurance rate map for her neighborhood. But Ms. Rivas-Spivey consulted with the Army Corps of Engineers and received a letter from it stating that the map had not changed since 1982. 
 Finally, in February 2006, Countrywide credited her escrow account for the flood insurance. In March, she received a letter from a Countrywide workout negotiator agreeing to correct her credit report for the months of August 2005 through February 2006. Still, with assorted late fees and owed payments piling up, she could not afford the loan. Neither could she afford the workout plan offered by Countrywide. 
 Ms. Rivas-Spivey said she and her fiance cannot pay the current monthly mortgage, which recently rose 20 percent, to $1,875, and is scheduled to rise again soon. Interest owed, late fees and other charges have increased the loan to $196,000 from $141,000 in late 2005. 
 ''I got two workout negotiators from Countrywide and they said 'if you can't afford your house, I can't help you,''' she said. Mr. Bailey called Ms. Rivas-Spivey's account of her dealings with Countrywide ''confused.'' The company corrected the flood insurance problem and put her on a workout program, he said, but she fell off after three months. ''It's difficult because she is so far behind,'' Mr. Bailey said. 
 Although Ms. Rivas-Spivey and her family remain in their three-bedroom home, they put it on the market last week. ''They put all the arrears on top of my payment,'' she said. ''Then it was impossible to pay, and we fell behind.''
 ZENA COLLINS of Gaithersburg, Md., is yet another Countrywide borrower who, while not in foreclosure, is in financial difficulty. An analyst for the Plumbers and Pipefitters National Pension Fund in Washington, Ms. Collins refinanced into an interest-only loan after she lost a previous job that paid her twice what she earns now. She said her interest rate is 10.9 percent and that after she pays her loan and insurance, she has $600 a month left to live on.
 Trying to act before foreclosure looms on her home, she has asked Countrywide to modify the terms of her loan. The company has refused. In a notice dated Sept. 20, Countrywide gave Ms. Collins this reason for being ineligible for help: ''Borrower does not qualify.''
 ''I would like for the people who make these decisions to be put in the same position that I was, having to choose not to have electricity from time to time because I didn't have any other option, really,'' Ms. Collins said. ''It makes one feel very desperate and hopeless.'' 
 The national foreclosure wave, meanwhile, may soon become a tsunami. Some $120 billion in adjustable-rate mortgages are scheduled to reset at higher interest rates in the next three months. Subprime, adjustable-rate loans make up about $90 billion of that. 
 In a recent interview, a Countrywide mortgage specialist on the West Coast said he was disturbed by the sight of customers streaming into his branch asking for help on loans they could not afford. The employee, who was granted anonymity because he feared that Countrywide might retaliate against him, said it took a full day for him to reach the right department at Countrywide for loan workouts. Even he had difficulty reaching the right HOPE Team member, he said. 
 Such efforts may soon become more difficult. At an investor conference on Sept. 18, Angelo R. Mozilo, Countrywide's chief executive, said the company would be hiring more staff members to do home-retention and loss-mitigation work. Those employees, however, will be based in India.

PERSON: William D. Rogers 

HEADLINE: William D. Rogers Is Dead at 80; Planned U.S. Policy in Latin America

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN and SARAH ABRUZZESE

 BODY:
William D. Rogers, a lawyer who helped plan the Kennedy and Johnson administrations' approach to Latin America and then served as a principal policymaker for the region during the Ford administration, died Sept. 22 near his home in Upperville, Va. He was 80.
 Mr. Rogers, a devotee of fox hunting, died during a hunt after suffering a heart attack while riding his favorite horse, Isaiah, his son William said. 
 Mr. Rogers, a Democrat, served in successive governmental positions interspersed with stints at the law firm of Arnold & Porter. As special counsel, then deputy United States coordinator of the Alliance for Progress, he helped shape President John F. Kennedy's new political and economic approach to Latin America. The alliance was dedicated to infusing the region with material help and political support to forestall Communist gains.
 Demonstrating his independent streak, Mr. Rogers resigned because of misgivings about President Lyndon B. Johnson's decision to invade the Dominican Republic in 1965 as well as about the gathering Vietnam War. By 1970, his opposition to that war had deepened, and he wrote an impassioned letter to The New York Times calling the United States invasion of Cambodia a flagrant violation of international law.
 Outside of government, he remained active in international affairs as president of the American Society of International Law, and was the first president of the Center for Inter-American Relations. He was also a board member of the Council on Foreign Relations.
 When Henry A. Kissinger became secretary of state in the administration of President Richard M. Nixon, he asked Mr. Rogers (no relation to William P. Rogers, Mr. Nixon's first secretary of state) to be a legal adviser in the State Department. Mr. Rogers declined to serve in the Nixon administration, but when Dr. Kissinger called again the day Mr. Nixon resigned in 1974, he accepted.
 Mr. Rogers first served President Gerald R. Ford as assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs. He negotiated treaties to transfer the Panama Canal to Panamanian sovereignty, but President Ford for political reasons did not want to sign them during the presidential election campaign. Mr. Ford lost, and President Jimmy Carter signed the agreements.
 The New York Times reported that Mr. Rogers secretly negotiated with Cuban officials from late 1974 until late 1975 to find ways to improve relations, in what could have been a reversal of previous American policies. In an interview, Dr. Kissinger, who continued as secretary of state under Mr. Ford, said, ''He put a new face on Latin American politics.''
 Mr. Ford appointed Mr. Rogers to the higher post of under secretary of state for economic affairs in September 1974. In addition to working on Latin American issues, he worked with Britain and South Africa to establish a large aid package to ease Rhodesia's transition to black-majority rule.
 In the Carter administration, at the president's request, Mr. Rogers investigated the killing of four American women who were missionaries. In the administration of the first President George Bush, Mr. Rogers helped formulate the legal rationale for the United States' invasion of Panama in 1989.
 In 1989, he joined Dr. Kissinger's consulting firm, Kissinger Associates, as vice chairman, while continuing his legal practice.
 William Dill Rogers was born on May 12, 1927, in Wilmington, Del. He worked in a shipyard building warships during the summers of 1942 and 1943. His father wanted him to take up his own career, chemistry, but after almost failing the subject at Princeton, Mr. Rogers drifted toward his favorite subjects, politics and international relations.
 He graduated from Princeton and Yale Law School, then clerked for Judge Charles E. Clark of the United States Court of Appeals and Justice Stanley F. Reed of the United States Supreme Court.
 Mr. Rogers joined what was then Arnold, Fortas & Porter, partly, he said, because he liked the firm's willingness to stand up to Senator Joseph R. McCarthy, the anti-Communist crusader, even if it meant losing clients. Mr. Rogers was active in the defense of Owen Lattimore, an author and educator whom Mr. McCarthy accused of being a Soviet spy. Charges against Mr. Lattimore were dismissed.
 Besides his son William Jr., of Alexandria, Va., Mr. Rogers is survived by his wife of 57 years, the former Suzanne Rochford; his sister, Judith Stone, of Cortez, Colo.; another son, Daniel, also of Alexandria; and four grandchildren.
 His son William said his father was declared dead almost immediately by a doctor participating in the fox hunt. An Episcopal priest was called, the hounds were collected and the hunters gathered for a short service on the spot.
 ''One by one, they rode past him and tipped their hats,'' William said.

HEADLINE: What's the Matter With College?

BYLINE: By RICK PERLSTEIN. 
Rick Perlstein is the author of ''Before the Storm: Barry Goldwater and the Unmaking of the American Consensus'' and the coming ''Nixonland: The Politics and Culture of the American Berserk, 1965-1972.''

 BODY:
When Ronald Reagan ran against Pat Brown in 1966 for the governorship of California, the defining issue was college. Governor Brown was completing the biggest university expansion in modern history nine new campuses. California's colleges and universities had been instrumental in turning the nation's biggest state into the world's seventh-biggest economy and an international cultural mecca and they formed the heart, Brown presumed, of his re-election appeal. Ronald Reagan's advisers agreed and sought to neutralize the higher-ed issue by having the actor announce his candidacy flanked by two Nobel Prize winners.
 Reagan had other ideas. For months he told campaign-trail audiences horror stories about the building takeovers, antiwar demonstrations and sexual deviance ''so vile that I cannot describe it to you'' at Berkeley, the University of California's flagship campus. Reagan's advisers warned him that disparaging the jewel of California civilization was political suicide. The candidate snapped back: ''Look, I don't care if I'm in the mountains, the desert, the biggest cities of this state, the first question: 'What are you going to do about Berkeley?' And each time the question itself would get applause.'' 
 It's unimaginable now that a gubernatorial race in the nation's largest state would come down to a debate about what was happening on campus. But it seemed perfectly natural then. The nation was obsessed with college and college students. It wasn't just the building takeovers and the generation gap; the obsession was well in gear by the presidency of John F. Kennedy. (In October 1961, Harper's devoted an issue to the subject.) The fascination was rooted in reasons as fresh as yesterday's op-ed pages: in an increasingly knowledge-based economy, good colleges were a social-mobility prerequisite, and between 1957 and 1967, the number of college students doubled. Reagan actually cast himself as this new class's savior, asking whether Californians would allow ''a great university to be brought to its knees by a noisy, dissident minority.'' To that, liberals responded that these communities' unique ability to tolerate noisy, dissident minorities was why universities were great.
 Now, as then, everyone says higher education is more important than ever to America's future. But interesting enough to become a topic of national obsession? Controversial enough to fight a gubernatorial campaign over? Hardly. The kids do have their own war now, but not much of an antiwar movement, much less building takeovers. College campuses seem to have lost their centrality. Why do college and college students no longer lead the culture? Why does student life no longer seem all that important?
 Here's one answer: College as America used to understand it is coming to an end.
 For nine years I've lived in the shadow of the University of Chicago -- as an undergraduate between 1988 and 1992 and again since 2002. After growing up in a suburb that felt like a jail to me, I found my undergraduate years delightfully noisy and dissident. I got involved with The Baffler, the journal of social criticism edited by Thomas Frank, who went on to write ''What's the Matter With Kansas?''; every Sunday, I trekked down to the neighborhood jazz jam session, where '60s continuities were direct. The bass player was a former Maoist, the drummer a former beatnik.
 Early in May of this year I had lunch with the beatnik, Doug Mitchell, who received his undergraduate degree in 1965 and then went to graduate school here and is now an editor at the University of Chicago Press. ''I suspect I got in this university primarily because I had a high-school friend who got a pirated copy of Henry Miller's 'Tropic of Capricorn,' '' he said. ''I put that on my reading list. And the admissions counselor was utterly astonished: 'How did you get this?' It was truly banned in 1960.'' He settled into an alienated suburban kid's paradise. ''We had a social life that kind of revolved around the dorm lounge, because that's where everybody hung out after midnight. And some people got way into it and didn't survive. They would never go to class. They would argue night and day in the lounge!''
 Mitchell and his friends enhanced their social life with special celebrity guest speakers, lured to their dorm lounge with little more than chutzpah and a phone call -- people like Anais Nin, Eudora Welty and Ralph Ellison. One kid, a loudmouthed New Yorker (overrepresented at Chicago, which didn't have Jewish quotas), confronted Ellison over the latter's distaste for Charlie Parker. Mitchell shakes his head in wonder. ''It was extraordinary to see this kind of head-to-head thing go on practically the first week you showed up on campus. The scrappy kids who were there wanted to mix it up with whoever came in.'' Mitchell's stories tumbled forth: baiting rednecks by reciting Lenny Bruce routines; listening to Elaine May and Mike Nichols records (they helped invent modern sketch comedy at the Compass Theater two blocks from campus in the 1950s); the midnight concert students organized in which John Cage shared the bill with Chicago jazz players. ''We seemed to have boundless verve. I had a friend who said, 'Why don't we call Dexter Gordon and get him to come to our dorm lounge and play?' Then we called John Coltrane and said, 'Would you like to do a concert with Ravi Shankar?' The point I'm trying to make is that the adventure of going to college consisted of a kind of freedom that you couldn't imagine until you turned 18, you were no longer under adult control and you made your own schedule. This is the most liberating moment Americans have in life.''
 Mitchell was beaming, but his face fell when I told him about my conversation the previous evening with Hamilton Morris, a New Yorker finishing up his first year of college. His parents are documentary filmmakers; his father is Errol Morris. He attended a high school of the arts where ''they sort of let me do whatever I wanted.'' He is a filmmaker, a painter, a photographer, an experienced professional stand-up comedian. His life precollege was exceptionally fulfilling, and he expected it to remain so here at one of the nation's great universities. Then what happened?
 ''I hated it from the first day,'' he told me. ''People here are so insanely uncreative, and they're proud of it.'' His fellow students ''had to spend their entire high-school experience studying for the SATs or something and didn't really get a chance to live life or experience things.''
 What was most harrowing was Hamilton's matter-of-fact description of a culture of enervation -- ''that so many people hate it with a passion and don't leave.'' I heard similar things from several bright, creative searchers on campus -- the kind of people in whom I recognized my own (and Doug Mitchell's) 19-year-old self. I sat down with a group of them at the Medici cafe, a campus fixture for decades, and they described college as a small town they were eager to escape. ''Everyone I talk to has that kind of feeling in their bones,'' Mike Yong, a Japanese-literature major, insisted. ''Even if they're going into investment banking.'' Someone offered the word ''infantilizing.'' Murmurs of assent, then the word ''emasculating,'' to louder agreement. One even insisted his process of political, social and creative awakening had happened, yes, during college -- not because of college but in spite of it.
 Is their diagnosis a function of college itself today, or just this particular college? Hamilton Morris told me stories that suggest the former. He visited his adviser and described his frustrations with the university. Her response: ''You're not meant for college. You should really drop out.'' He struck up a conversation with a student on his floor ''who as far as I can tell doesn't have any friends at all, and nobody talks to him. He has no desire to transfer -- even though he's unhappy. I feel like a lot of people are like that as well. You know: 'College sucks anyway, so I might as well stay here.' ''
 Most of my interviewees were happy. Caroline Ouwerkerk was ecstatically so. As I futzed with my digital recorder, she gushed, ''I'll talk all day about the university, whether or not I'm being recorded!'' She gushed about the housing system, which sorts students randomly into teamlike ''houses,'' where ''someone is caring for you right from the start.'' She gushed about her job with the university-sponsored Community Service Leadership Training Corps and about her volunteer work advising prospective students. We met in the spacious lobby of the campus art museum, where she had already been three times but had yet to see the paintings; she was always there for a reception or a meeting. I asked if many of her fellow students felt alienated from society, as many young people did in the 1960s. ''I don't think anyone really feels that,'' she responded. ''I am so impressed with so many of my peers at the university, with what they've accomplished before they go there in their high-school years, what they've accomplished now.''
 Caroline is smart. She is passionate. She has a social conscience and a mature grasp of the extraordinary privileges life has handed her. A reporter slotting her in for an interview also discovers she's astonishingly overscheduled -- ''Right now it's probably the worst time to ask me what I do for fun!'' -- but even her fun is impressive: an anthropology major specializing in food culture, she has been all over the city discovering exotic new ethnic restaurants. Caroline is a pristine example of what the Times columnist David Brooks called, in a 2001 Atlantic Monthly article on college, an Organization Kid. She is, indeed, a cog in the organization -- specifically, the bureaucracy that schedules students' self-exploration, the very facet of campus culture that Mike Yong and his friends find most ''infantilizing.'' Organization Kids don't mind it.
 Most people make their accommodation between the two extremes. Their numbers include, interestingly enough, most of the campus activists. Jonathan Hirsch is a right-of-center example. As the president of Chicago Friends of Israel, one of the actions he led was taking over the Q. and A. session at a panel on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that the Friends considered unbalanced.
 Hirsch is a case study of a phenomenon that wouldn't have made sense even to Ronald Reagan in 1966: the saturation of higher education with market thinking. It cuts against the presumption that the campus should be a place radically apart from the rest of society -- its own ''city-state,'' as the British poet Stephen Spender wrote in a 1968 essay entirely typical of the era's what's-happening-on-campus genre. A biology major, Hirsch is most passionate about biotechnology. His ambition is to work for a venture-capital firm. He became excited telling me about the summer job he had at the University of Chicago's Office of Technology and Intellectual Property and about sitting on a committee to help set up a university ''biotech incubator, where a new biotechnology company can be started up.'' He also expresses disappointment in Chicago's relative lack of market mojo: ''Stanford commercializes a lot of stuff very well. This university has a lot of stuff that would be great, but we don't act on it.'' I asked whether incentivizing science according to its marketability might distort the university's mission to nurture ideas on the basis of intellectual merit, regardless of commercial potential. He's a bright kid, but I'm not sure he understood the question.
 Just before these interviews, there had been a wave of campus activism: Chicago was considering replacing its idiosyncratic Uncommon Application in favor of the so-called Common Application used by many top-tier schools. ''I love the Uncommon Application,'' Hirsch said. Then he added, ''But at the same time I want the value of my degree to go up.'' One thing that the U.S. News & World Report rankings measure, he explained, is ''selectivity,'' and the Uncommon Application (goes the theory) kills Chicago's selectivity rate by keeping more people from applying. Interestingly enough, when I later spoke to a pro-Uncommon Application advocate, his argument for it was likewise couched in economic terms.
 I brought up another goal of campus activists to Jonathan Hirsch: reversing Chicago's decision, unusual among top-tier universities, not to divest from the military government of Sudan in protest against the genocide in Darfur. He responded: ''I understand their whole position. But, well, I'm not going to intrude myself on the investment decisions of the university.'' He then began a sophisticated critique of the marginal utility limited, he says of the divestment strategy as politics. When I later presented his arguments to a group of Darfur activists, they laid out their own position in market language: ''In terms of the prevailing trend in corporate social responsibility, as a large corporation, albeit a university, we want our university to remain competitive in that respect.''
 There is something that these very different students share. Just as the distance between the campus and the market has shrunk (perhaps not that surprising at Chicago, home of the market-based approach to almost everything), so has the gap between childhood and college and between college and the real world that follows. To me, to Doug Mitchell, to just about anyone over 30, going to college represented a break, sometimes a radical one and our immediate postcollege lives represented a radical break with college. Some of us ended up coming back to the neighborhood partly for that very fact: nostalgia for four years unlike any we had experienced or would experience again. Not for these kids.
 Hamilton Morris, with his hip, creative parents, is an extreme case of a common phenomenon: college without the generation gap. (As I write this at a coffee shop near campus, a kid picks up her cellphone -- ''Hi, Dad!'' -- and chats amiably for 15 minutes. ''When we went to college,'' a dean of students who was a freshman in 1971 tells me, ''you called on Sunday -- the obligatory 30-second phone call on the dorm phone -- and you hoped not to hear from them for the rest of the week.'')
 Morris is an exaggeration too of another banal new reality. You used to have to go to college to discover your first independent film, read your first forbidden book, find freaks like yourself who shared, say, a passion for Lenny Bruce. Now for even the most provincial students, the Internet, a radically more democratic and diverse culture -- and those hip baby-boomer parents -- take care of the problem.
 Caroline hopped on a community-service track in high school, continued in college and plans on a career working in the same kind of service bureaucracy after graduation as she does now. Jonathan will experience the same sort of continuity -- he has embraced a worldview in which erasing the distinction between the university and the world outside it is the entire point. Some of these kids, indeed, might end up having more of a ''college'' experience when they enter the workplace than beforehand. The workplace may be more surprising and maybe even more creative.
 Why aren't people paying attention to the campuses? Because, as a discrete experience, ''college'' has begun to disappear. My radical, alienated friends brought up the University of Chicago's marketing materials: bucolic images of a mystic world apart, where 18-year-olds discover themselves for the first time in a heady atmosphere of cultural and intellectual tumult. But college no longer looks like that. They wondered how long the admissions office thought it could get away with it before students started complaining they'd been swindled. I posed the question to a brilliant graduating senior, someone I've been friends with for years. ''They're assuming that the marketing is for students,'' he explained. ''It's not. It's for parents.''
 Who had, you know, gone to college back when it was college.

HEADLINE: Op-Ed: That Old House

BYLINE: By Richard Moe. 
Richard Moe is the president of the National Trust for Historic Preservation.

 BODY:
Washington
 THERE'S a battle raging across the country -- especially in states like Connecticut, New Jersey and New York -- and older neighborhoods are on the front lines. The outcome will determine whether the historic character that makes these places unique and attractive will be preserved or obliterated.
The problem is teardowns -- the practice of buying a house just to demolish it and put up a larger one in its place. Sounds innocuous enough, but in an older neighborhood, teardowns can be a disaster. This pattern of replacing architecturally distinctive homes with large new structures that loom over their neighbors ultimately destroys the very qualities that make the neighborhood appealing to newcomers and longtime residents alike. 
 The teardown trend has resulted in a coast-to-coast frenzy of destruction. My organization, the National Trust for Historic Preservation, has identified more than 400 communities where the tearing down of houses is seriously destroying the historic and architectural beauty of neighborhoods. 
 Sadly, the New York metropolitan area is at the center of this epidemic, with New Jersey ranking first in the nation in the number of places experiencing a significant level of teardowns. In Tenafly, when citizens protested the demolition of the Hensel House, which was built in 1909 and was one of the town's most important historic houses, the developer told them: ''I don't look at this house as historic. I look at it as being a potentially unique situation for subdividing that is allowable by ordinance.'' 
 Things are no better in other parts of the region. Teardowns are a huge problem on Long Island, especially in the Hamptons, and concern over the teardown rampage in White Plains has residents pushing for a design review board for the city's residential neighborhoods. Meanwhile, in New Canaan, Conn., more than a dozen classic Modernist houses -- some of them designed by world-famous architects like Marcel Breuer and John Johansen -- have been replaced by sprawling new residences.
 But teardowns destroy more than houses. Neighborhood livability is diminished as trees are removed, backyards are eliminated and sunlight is blocked by bulky new structures built right up to the property lines. Economic and social diversity are reduced as costly new houses replace more affordable ones, including the modest ''starter homes'' that our parents knew and that first-time homebuyers still search for today. As teardowns proliferate and once-quiet streets turn into construction zones, residents find themselves pitted against developers and begin to feel they've lost control of the place they call home. 
 Nobody is suggesting that older neighborhoods should be frozen in time. Retaining economic viability means replacing outdated and inefficient structures, but brutally shoehorning McMansions into a modestly scaled area isn't the way to do it. Even in areas where vacant land is scarce, existing houses can be enlarged in ways that don't violate the neighborhood's character. Communities don't have to choose between preservation and reinvestment; they can have both. 
 Realizing this, more and more places are using innovative planning tools and strategies to put the brakes on teardowns and foster compatible development. In Oyster Bay, N.Y., local leaders have been tweaking outdated zoning and land-use measures to ensure that new construction projects respect the neighborhood instead of wrecking it. 
 Yonkers and Glen Cove, N.Y., are addressing the teardowns issue as part of a larger review of their planning and zoning laws. Some communities across the region have enacted preservation ordinances that prevent demolition or inappropriate alteration of buildings with historic or architectural significance, while others have approved residential development standards that regulate the height, shape and size of houses, protect mature trees and discourage garage doors that face the street. 
 Still others, including Bedford and Rye Brook, both in Westchester County, N.Y., have imposed demolition moratoriums as a means of buying time while they figure out what to do next. 
 Measures like these are essential because the status quo isn't working. Every day, another modest cottage gets bulldozed, and what goes up in its place is Tara on a quarter-acre lot. Nearby, a house that once might have been praised as ''charming and historic'' now gets marketed as ''older home on expansive lot,'' which in real estate parlance means it's a teardown. 
 It doesn't have to be this way. Communities should be shaped by choice, not by chance. Indeed, as residents and homeowners, we should take an active role in assessing where our neighborhood is headed and finding ways to protect the qualities we cherish and the reasons we are drawn to certain communities. After all, we can protect our property values by respecting the contributions of previous generations and making sure that new construction is compatible with them. We can also demand thoughtful planning and effective land-use and preservation tools that will allow for growth and change without sacrificing livability.
 But most important, we can -- and must -- choose to take care of what we have instead of smashing it to rubble and hauling it off to the landfill.

Cynthia Brooke Carter and Kenneth Andre Silber were married yesterday at Mohonk Mountain House in New Paltz, N.Y. The Rev. Angela S. Ifill, an Episcopal priest, officiated. 
 The bride, 37, is a senior designer at Domingo Gonzalez Associates, an architectural lighting design firm in Manhattan. She graduated from Syracuse University and received a master's degree in lighting from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. She is the daughter of Lael Carter and William S. Carter of Shaker Heights, Ohio. 
 The bridegroom, 42, is a freelance writer and editor in Manhattan for newspapers and magazines; he specializes in science and economics. He graduated from New York University. He is a son of Rita Silber of Elmhurst, Queens, and the late Erich Silber.
 In keeping with Ms. Carter's occupation, light was an integral part of the couple's first date. Mr. Silber suggested that they meet ''in the shadow of the Flatiron building'' on Lower Broadway in Manhattan. Ms. Carter said she was taken with the romance of the idea, but hoped it didn't mean she would have to stand in the middle of the street. Fortunately, she did not.

Economic and social diversity are reduced as costly new houses replace more affordable ones, including the modest ''starter homes'' that our parents knew and that first-time homebuyers still search for today.

 Nobody is suggesting that older neighborhoods should be frozen in time.

 Realizing this, more and more places are using innovative planning tools and strategies to put the brakes on teardowns and foster compatible development. In Oyster Bay, N.Y., local leaders have been tweaking outdated zoning and land-use measures to ensure that new construction projects respect the neighborhood instead of wrecking it. 
 Yonkers and Glen Cove, N.Y., are addressing the teardowns issue as part of a larger review of their planning and zoning laws. Some communities across the region have enacted preservation ordinances that prevent demolition or inappropriate alteration of buildings with historic or architectural significance, while others have approved residential development standards that regulate the height, shape and size of houses, protect mature trees and discourage garage doors that face the street.

 It doesn't have to be this way. Communities should be shaped by choice, not by chance. Indeed, as residents and homeowners, we should take an active role in assessing where our neighborhood is headed and finding ways to protect the qualities we cherish and the reasons we are drawn to certain communities.

 THERE'S a battle raging across the country -- especially in states like Connecticut, New Jersey and New York -- and older neighborhoods are on the front lines. The outcome will determine whether the historic character that makes these places unique and attractive will be preserved or obliterated.
The problem is teardowns -- the practice of buying a house just to demolish it and put up a larger one in its place. Sounds innocuous enough, but in an older neighborhood, teardowns can be a disaster. This pattern of replacing architecturally distinctive homes with large new structures that loom over their neighbors ultimately destroys the very qualities that make the neighborhood appealing to newcomers and longtime residents alike. 
 The teardown trend has resulted in a coast-to-coast frenzy of destruction. My organization, the National Trust for Historic Preservation, has identified more than 400 communities where the tearing down of houses is seriously destroying the historic and architectural beauty of neighborhoods. 
 Sadly, the New York metropolitan area is at the center of this epidemic, with New Jersey ranking first in the nation in the number of places experiencing a significant level of teardowns. In Tenafly, N.J., when citizens protested the demolition of the Hensel House, which was built in 1909 and was one of the town's most important historic houses, the developer told them: ''I don't look at this house as historic. I look at it as being a potentially unique situation for subdividing that is allowable by ordinance.'' 
 Things are no better in other parts of the region. Teardowns are a huge problem in the Hamptons, and concern over the teardown rampage in White Plains has residents pushing for a design review board for the city's residential neighborhoods. Meanwhile, in New Canaan, Conn., more than a dozen classic Modernist houses -- some of them designed by world-famous architects like Marcel Breuer and John Johansen -- have been replaced by sprawling new residences.

Campus Drinking and Responsibility
 To the Editor:
Re ''Closer Eye on Campus Drinking'' (Sept. 23): 
 Isn't it ironic that college admissions officers seemingly never mention education programs or policies to combat binge drinking, yet proudly show off the ''blue light'' used to report a suspicious incident and the text-message alert notification system to warn of a terrorist attack? 
 As twins who are high school seniors, we acknowledge the prevalence of irresponsible drinking by students. We are interested in how our prospective colleges address this equally dangerous and even more probable occurrence.
 Daniel Schneider-Weiler Joshua Schneider-Weiler Port Washington
 To the Editor:
 There seems to be a common theme spreading across college campuses nationwide: accountability. This trend is preventing students from experiencing a complete education.
 There was a time when students were considered capable people. They were allowed to make their own decisions and learn from their own actions. When did personal accountability shift from the individual to the institutions that surround them? Protectionism is no longer just a term of economics; rather its principles have seeped into the process of educating America's youth.
 There comes a point when people must learn for themselves. Scaring students away from drinking for four years in college teaches them nothing about behaving responsibly when they reach legal age. College is more than just textbooks and exams. It is a time for the next generation to learn how to become responsible adults.

Exploration, Not Memorization
To the Editor:
 Re ''The Garlanded Classroom'' (Sept. 23):
 It is a sad commentary on early childhood education in New York City when the main critique of the Reggio Emilia approach is that it is not proven to boost the standardized test scores of those entering kindergarten. 
 The Reggio approach requires children to engage in complex problem solving to address issues that are of immediate importance. Academic skills are taught, but are done so conceptually through an integrated approach as children investigate and explore their world under the guidance of their teachers. This is vastly different from the method of rote memorization and regurgitation that we see so often in American schools.
 The Reggio approach is not new. It draws upon the work of John Dewey, Maria Montessori and many other noteworthy educational philosophers. However, many preschools have abandoned best teaching practices for test preparation. 
 Standardized tests, most experts agree, do not accurately reflect ability in the preschool population and may be economically and culturally biased. The Reggio approach is a call to early childhood educators to re-focus on the goal of instilling in young children a love of learning -- a gift that will last a lifetime.
 Elizabeth Matthews Upper East Side
 The writer is an assistant professor of early childhood education, Hunter College. 
 To the Editor:
 I was thrilled to read your article about the Reggio Emilia philosophy. 
 During my tenure at Beginnings Nursery School I witnessed the development of many long-term projects that reflected the context of living in New York City. Two of these projects, a study of Union Square Park and the opening of a store, provided children exposure and experience with the following: writing stories, counting, problem solving, mapping, measuring, designing, drawing and research. 
 They became citizens of the community and greater New York. These children were prepared for any kind of school -- progressive, traditional, public or private. 
 I have to argue with those who say these children aren't ''ready'' for challenging programs. As senior director of Blue Man Creativity Center, I'm certain that children who are experiencing collaboration with teachers will have an exceptional educational experience that supports their literal and visual ideas. With that foundation, they will be able to take on the world! 
 Jane Racoosin Brooklyn Heights
 To the Editor:
 As a teacher at Beansprouts Preschool in Brooklyn, I note that child-centered education, with art as the students' primary expressive tool, is by no means exclusively the approach of Reggio Emilia schools. 
 Indeed, it is difficult to imagine a preschool classroom that takes any other form.
