HEADLINE: The Book of Isaiah

BYLINE: By Geoffrey Wheatcroft. 
Geoffrey Wheatcroft is the author of several books, including ''The Controversy of Zion.''

 BODY:

LETTERS, 1928-1946
By Isaiah Berlin.
Edited by Henry Hardy.
Illustrated. 755 pp.
Cambridge University Press. $40.
 WHEN he died in 1997, at the age of 88, there was a sense, among people who had never met Sir Isaiah Berlin, as well as those who revered him in person, that a light had gone out. He had become a towering figure in the intellectual and cultural life of England, which had taken him to its heart, something reflected by the honors showered on him and by the huge and hugely eminent congregation that gathered for his memorial service at Hampstead Synagogue. Not many scholars have inspired such respect, or such affection. 
 But those weren't the only reactions Berlin aroused. In his lifetime and again after his death there were plenty of detractors who regarded him with suspicion or worse, for a variety of reasons. This long book, the first of what are intended to be three volumes of his letters, helps explain the devotion, but it may also offer a little ammunition to the critics.
 Merely as a human story, Berlin's life was astonishing. Born in Riga in 1909 into a vast cousinage that included the Lubavitcher rebbes, Isaiah Mendelevich Berlin was taken to Petrograd as a small boy, and then to London in 1921 when the Bolsheviks allowed his prosperous (and fortunate) parents to leave.
 Young Shaya, as he was known to family and close friends, went to St. Paul's School in London: the first letter -- written with the sonorous courtesy Berlin had already mastered at 18 -- is to G. K. Chesterton, an old boy of the school. He had a happy and of course brilliantly successful undergraduate career at Oxford, culminating in a prize fellowship at All Souls College, the first Jew ever elected to that haughty and complacent corporation.
 Having spent the 1930's as a philosophy tutor, Berlin wanted to serve in some diplomatic role when war came (health kept him out of the army). After an abortive attempt to get to Russia, he went instead to New York and then Washington, and it was his dazzling reports to London on the American political situation, echoed in several of the letters here, that brought him to the attention of the highest circles. This led in turn to the occasion when a Mr. I. Berlin was found to be in London and was summoned to lunch with Churchill. After lengthy but mutually baffled attempts to discuss Washington politics, the prime minister asked his guest which of his own works he was most proud of, and was told, ''Maybe 'White Christmas.' ''
 Cerebral gifts apart, Isaiah Berlin had a genius for friendship and a huge personal appeal that communicates itself in print; and ''Letters, 1928-1946'' is compulsive reading merely as a document of English social and literary history. In the 1920's, when young things were still bright, he acquired an appropriately camp and frivolous tone. His personality shines through in letters that are witty, breezy, snobby, gossipy, on occasion downright bitchy and sometimes verging on stream of consciousness.
 But then there is an audible change of mood, as if the jackboots can be heard at the gates of Brideshead. Berlin did not himself become politically engaged on left or right, but many of his friends did. They included Shiela Grant Duff (who died only months ago at 90) and two dangerous charmers who ensnared her, Goronwy Rees and the German Adam von Trott. Rees at the very least flirted with the Communist underground, while von Trott played a highly equivocal role of a different kind. Having impressed his English friends with his liberalism, he claimed that the anti-Semitism of Hitler's regime was much exaggerated. No one was more appalled than Berlin. Adam was no hero, he told Shiela: ''His charm is very great indeed, his intellectual honesty mediocre.'' 
 That last word could never be used of Berlin, but other criticisms have been made -- personal, academic, political. He was sometimes denigrated for his reticence or timidity, although to say this about a man of perfectly normal amorous instincts who didn't manage to go to bed with a woman until he was over 40 might seem to be stating the obvious. 
 Then again, he has been portrayed as a dilettante or lightweight. It is impossible to deny that he was a snob, of a mostly harmless kind. He enjoyed life among the rich (Lord Rothschild provided a private plane to fly him from Cambridge to Oxford); he taught formal logic to ''a class of Etonian rowing men'' with no obvious regret; he became so assimilated an Englishman that he could write in 1941: ''America is hateful. . . . Everybody is enormously relentlessly boring.'' 
 At the end of this volume, Berlin decides to abandon philosophy for the history of thought. Not all his colleagues regarded this as a genuine subject, and the idea that he was an academic butterfly was strengthened by the fact that, apart from his early study of Marx, he wrote no full-length books. Carpers may also notice that few of these merry letters deal with the tedious administrative side of academic life.
 No one has devoted himself more to silencing critics and burnishing Berlin's reputation than Henry Hardy. The several collections of essays he edited show what a master Berlin was of that form. Hardy's editing of this book is commendably and sometimes obsessively detailed, though just occasionally uninformed. A footnote contrasting the historian Christopher Hill's Communism with someone else's membership in the Oxford University Labor Club in the late 1930's suggests Hardy doesn't know that the Labor Club was itself then Communist-controlled. 
 Another barrage of detraction has long come from that species for which ''anti-Communist'' is the harshest term of abuse (and which cannot be persuaded by any amount of evidence that it might have been quite a good thing to be anti). In the postwar years Berlin certainly identified himself with liberal anti-Communism, but what is peculiarly fascinating about these letters is how politically complex life was in the 30's. 
 Most of the time Berlin remained a conventional progressive. He was uncensorious when a friend like Stephen Spender joined the party, he saw the Spanish Civil War as the essential political litmus test of the period, and he was contemptuous of the ''awful'' Friedrich von Hayek and of Ludwig von Mises, who kept alive the classical liberal, or libertarian, economic tradition. 
 More riveting still, Berlin's traveling companion on his first American visit was none other than his good friend Guy Burgess. Berlin also knew and liked Anthony Blunt (he and Burgess ''are probably so made as to see the truth more brightly drunk than sober''), and he later said that he had no idea Burgess was a Communist, let alone a Soviet agent, which suggests an implausible innocence in one so sophisticated. 
 He did have his own great cause. A whole book could be written on ''Berlin the Jew.'' He was intensely proud of his heritage, as his sweet and loving letters to his parents show, and he found in Zionism a substitute for the religious faith he couldn't share, as well as an alternative to the other political enticements of the age. 
 For him, Zionism meant first of all an affirmation of identity and a repudiation of all those shamefaced Jews he hated. And ''hated'' is not too strong a word. Berlin's outward geniality was often combined with a sharp tongue and pen: one forgotten figure from London literary life is ''detestable,'' while the Prince of Wales, who became king and then Duke of Windsor, is ''vulgar and awful.'' This vocabulary of abuse included ''cryptoness,'' which for Berlin meant Jews trying to hide their background. In a telling phrase, he said to a friend that her grandfather was ''one of the very, very very few English Jews of any station by whom one was in no way embarrassed.'' 
 In 1934 Berlin visited Palestine for the first time. ''I want to see everyone,'' he wrote. ''If I could lunch with the mufti I would.'' He did in fact lunch with George Antonius, one of the founders of Palestinian nationalism, a ''very formidable enemy.'' But for all his exhilaration he was disappointed with the Zionist leaders: ''Why aren't there any superior persons in Palestine? only . . . efficient demagogues like Ben-Gurion?''
 During the war he was much absorbed in American Zionist politics, and the book ends with a Jewish state in sight. But not only with that. For all the private jollity and political gossip in this collection, there is a soft descant of sorrow. In the family trees for his relatives in east Europe, the dates of birth and death too frequently end with 1941 or 1942. And in the very week of victory over Hitler, Berlin tells his parents almost as an aside the news he now knows for sure: ''nobody left in Riga.''

HEADLINE: Keeping the Public Eye on Things Beautiful

BYLINE: By SUSAN HODARA

 BODY:
FROM the 45 works by major contemporary sculptors that adorn the Donald M. Kendall Sculpture Gardens at PepsiCo headquarters in Purchase, to the 1990's ''Hands Across the Bridge'' mural on the North Avenue Bridge in New Rochelle, to the 1914 bronze statue of Horace Greeley that greets those heading into Chappaqua, public art of all varieties can be found throughout Westchester County. 
 But the need to continue enhancing public spaces with art does not stop there, and a symposium held this month explored the formation of a centralized public art program in Westchester. 
 ''Public art enhances economic development, creates a sense of place and fosters civic pride,'' said Janet Langsam, executive director of the Westchester Arts Council, who estimated that Westchester already has more than 100 pieces. ''As an arts organization, we are looking at how to encourage the placement of more public art in the public landscape.'' 
 The forms of such art range from monuments and memorials to sculptures, murals, fountains, mosaics, architectural forms and signage. Pieces can be placed in parks and plazas, around buildings, at transportation hubs or wherever they are visible to passers-by. Many are designed as site-specific installations, supported by government, corporate or private funds.
 At the symposium, ''Public Art: What's in It for Westchester?,'' with PepsiCo as host and the Westchester Arts Council as sponsor, government officials, architects, developers, business leaders and artists gave their insights on how best to approach establishing a formal public art program. The symposium coincided with the Arts Council's exhibition, ''Before and After: Imagining Public Art in Westchester,'' for which 30 artists envisioned works for local public spaces.
 Early examples of public art in Westchester -- murals in post offices, schools and libraries -- were commissioned in the 1930's by the Federal Art Project under President Franklin D. Roosevelt. More recent additions, both from 2001, are the Great Hunger Memorial in V.E. Macy Park in Ardsley, five anguished bronze figures created by Eamonn O'Doherty to recall the famine that ravaged Ireland between 1845 and 1851; and ABZ16, a red steel structure designed by Robert Goodnough and placed in front of the Northern Westchester Center for the Arts in Mount Kisco. ''Fabrications,'' an outdoor installation of eight banners by Curt Belshe and Lise Prown, was hung in 2003 from lampposts along Bank Street in Peekskill.
 IN April, the county selected Frederic Schwartz for his design of a Sept. 11 memorial at Kensico Dam Plaza, a county-owned park in Valhalla. Mr. Schwartz owns the Manhattan-based Frederic Schwartz Architects and founded the Think team, finalists for the Sept. 11 memorial at ground zero. His Westchester project, ''The Rising,'' to be completed by Sept. 11, 2005, will commemorate the 109 county residents who died in the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. A stainless steel structure of 109 intertwined strands rising 80 feet, it will exemplify ''the strength of the Westchester community and the families who lost loved ones,'' Mr. Schwartz said at the public arts forum.
 A Croton-on-Hudson artist, Francesca Samsel, had made contributions to public art that include an interactive sundial installed in 2001 at the Mohansic Elementary School in Yorktown, an inlaid sidewalk at the Metro-North train station in Croton-on-Hudson and murals in Croton-on-Hudson, Croton Point Park and Peekskill. 
 ''Many communities around the country have 'percent for arts' programs,'' she said, describing several public art financing options, ''whereby public funds are earmarked for artworks.''
 Artists can also raise money on their own, which is how Ms. Samsel helped finance her Croton Point Park mural. ''We got seed money from the Westchester Arts Council,'' she said. ''Then we raised about $20,000 from community members.''
 A sculptural form called ''Fireclock,'' which incorporates bursts of flame and was designed by Gayil Nalls for Renaissance Plaza in White Plains, is undergoing a feasibility study to work out technical and safety issues. The plaza is already the site of a year-old fountain that was described by Paul Wood, White Plains economic development coordinator, as ''Bellagio-style, with jets of water shooting and dancing 60 feet in the air and choreographed to music.''
 Commuters have profited from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's Arts for Transit program, which commissions permanent pieces for stations that are being renovated. Nine stations, including Scarsdale, Crestwood and North White Plains, already have installations. The most recent piece, 12 faceted glass panels at the Harrison station, was completed in 2001 by Tova Snyder, a White Plains artist. Another, ''Muhheakantuck,'' a sculpture by Barbara Segal, a Yonkers sculptor, will be unveiled at the Yonkers station this fall. Other projects have been commissioned for Dobbs Ferry and Larchmont.
 The Maria Fareri Children's Hospital at Westchester Medical Center in Valhalla, which is due to open by the end of summer, has commissioned eight site-specific pieces as part of a permanent art collection that will be placed throughout the center and will be open to the public.
 Mr. Schwartz called public art ''food for the spirit.'' When he lived in Rome, he said, ''every step you take you see great art.''
 ''We've forgotten the importance of that here,'' he added. ''But Westchester is taking positive steps in the right direction.''

HEADLINE: Bad Climate?

 BODY:
 To the Editor:
 Having read several new books on climate change, your reviewer Verlyn Klinkenborg advises us to be frightened (''Be Afraid. 
Be Very Afraid,'' May 30). I'll resist.
 How is it possible, I wonder, to review the updated ''Limits to Growth'' book and Paul R. Ehrlich's latest tome without showing even a trace of recognition that these authors' predictions are notorious for being consistently and dazzlingly wrong? In ''The Population Bomb'' (1968), for example, Ehrlich predicted that ''the battle to feed all of humanity is over. In the 1970's the world will undergo famines -- hundreds of millions of people are going to starve to death in spite of any crash programs embarked upon now.'' Ehrlich later lost his bet with the economist Julian Simon that resource scarcity would intensify during the 1980's.
 Suppose that a glib and frantic free-market ideologue had written a book 30 years ago predicting that continued regulation and taxation would wreak catastrophic destruction on society by 1985. Further suppose that when that specific prediction proved false, the same ideologue wrote another book advancing the same thesis, with only the year of reckoning changed. That prediction, too, failed. Now the ideologue offers yet another book with the same thesis. Would this ''scholar's'' book be reviewed in The New York Times? Would Klinkenborg take it seriously? If not, what's with the respect accorded to a ''Limits to Growth'' update and yet another prediction from Paul Ehrlich?

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths
FARMER, CAROL

 BODY:
 FARMER--Carol. World renowned futurist, consumer trend analyst, captivating keynote speaker and strategic advisor to the Fortune 50 on issues of marketing and positioning. Carol died, unexpectedly, of a massive stroke on June 19, 2004, in Delray Beach, Florida, while visiting from her home, Brenguelven, in Landudec, France. Born in Columbus, Ohio on August 14, 1944 to John Edwin Farmer and the late Ruth Cooper Farmer, she is survived by her father and stepmother, Jeannine of Columbus. She graduated from DePauw University in Greencastle, Indiana and spent her early business career with the strategic consulting firms, Management Horizons and The Doody Company in Columbus, and then as Executive Vice President, Marketing, for Lerner Stores and the retail divisions of American Can, both in New York. Her prominence and recognition grew in the mid - eighties when she opened her own firm, Carol Farmer Associates, first in New York City, then in Boca Raton, Florida and, in 1994 in France. Carol was actively involved in numerous management and retail-related organizations and served as a director of two NYSE listed companies ---The Sports Authority and Lowe's Corporation. She was respected for her unique angle of vision, one that translated complex social, economic, political and cultural issues into business solutions. In the early nineties, Carol launched trendtrax as an interactive video newsletter for senior management. Her latest body of work converged in the concept she termed, ''Second Wind,'' insights and analysis of how baby boomers are continuing to re-define the aging process. 
Carol was a voracious reader, a lifelong learner and an early adopter of the creative use of computer technology. She was loved deeply by a worldwide circle of friends who have come together this past week to express their grief and console one another via e-mail and telephone. Carol will be remembered for her infectious curiosity; her generosity to friends; her beloved Bedlington terriers; and her latest passions ---Brittany and combining her life-long skill in painting with photography, video and digitized imagery. Her remains will be cremated and her ashes scattered over the waters at Pte. du Brezelec in Brittany. Celebrations of the life of Carol Farmer will be held in both Columbus and New York City and will be announced at a later date. Contributions can be made in her memory to the Animal Rescue League, 3200 N. Military Trail, W. Palm Beach, Florida, 33409, 561-686-3663.

HEADLINE: Much Closer To the Top, But Still At a Distance

BYLINE: By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS. 
E-mail: amh@nytimes.com

 BODY:
SOMEHOW, everyone seemed to know that a ''diversity networking reception'' would draw African-Americans in much greater numbers than, say, Latinos or Asians. There were a few of those, but mainly the crowd at the Judson Grill on West 52nd Street on Tuesday night was black. As Janelle Alexander, an investment banker, characterized herself and most of the conservatively dressed people around her, they were also Type A. Some of the eye contact was not just measuring but downright searing.
 This was no ordinary mixer. The event had been organized by the august law firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison as a way for ''diversity professionals'' to ''network and exchange ideas,'' as the invitation put it. Adding gravitas and cachet was the guest of honor, Charles J. Ogletree Jr., the Harvard Law School professor who was there to discuss his new book on Brown v. Board of Education. 
 More than 600 people had R.S.V.P.'d, and it turned out that almost all of them had shown up, packed in like passengers on the No. 6 train at rush hour, sipping wine and eating shrimp, lobster in puff pastry and baby lamb chops. You knew it was a power event when the Rev. Al Sharpton arrived in black suit and red tie, eliciting only slightly less applause than Derrick A. Bell Jr., famous for leaving Harvard Law School on principle after becoming its first tenured black professor. 
 The diversity party seemed to expose exactly the point Professor Bell, now at New York University, made when he left Harvard in the early 90's: how undiverse the top echelons of American society really are. Here, by night, was a room filled with African-Americans from Ivy League schools and Top 20 legal and financial firms. By day, those same people met in boardrooms filled with whites. A seamlessly integrated society seemed still elusive.
 These professionals were too young to remember the worst indignities and inhumanity of segregation, the whites-only restaurants, drinking fountains and schools, and too privileged to feel bitter. Yet their stories revealed how often a sense of discomfort and outsiderness crept into their daily transactions. At least at a diversity party, they were in the majority.
 Though Diarra McKinney was born 23 years after the Brown decision, he remembers no white students in his Washington, D.C., schools from kindergarten through high school. Later, at Stanford, he was suddenly in the minority. Now, before entering his third year at Yale Law, studying the face book at the Sullivan & Cromwell, he has found only 2 other black summer associates, among more than 90. Those numbers instill a warring sense of both inferiority and superiority.
 ''You feel it,'' he said. Still, he added, ''It's not stifling.'' When he interviewed for the summer job, he said, he bonded with the interviewers, who were white, by talking about their shared experiences at Yale.
 Alita Wingfield had the opposite experience, growing up in an integrated community in North Babylon, on Long Island, and encountering racial isolation only when she moved to the Upper East Side with her husband, a medical resident, and their two small children. 
 Her son is in kindergarten at Public School 183, on 66th Street near First Avenue. Her neighbors often think, she said, that she is not like them. ''People automatically assume I have a variance, that he's been bused in from Brooklyn,'' she said. When she schedules play dates, she added, ''people don't assume I live in the neighborhood.''
 There's some empirical truth to these assumptions. Ms. Wingfield's daughter is the only black girl in her day care class. Her son is one of four black children in his kindergarten class. So she understands why many middle-class blacks live in a neighborhood like, say, Harlem, even though their economic and professional self-interest might dictate the Upper East Side. ''We live in a building that's only doctors,'' she said. ''I don't want them to see only white doctors and daddy.'' 
 She was beside herself when her son's principal sent home a newsletter describing February as a dreary month in which there was little to celebrate. Ms. Wingfield immediately dashed off a two-page letter pointing out that February was Black History Month. And when she confronted him, the principal was contrite. 
 On a lighter note, the diversity party sparked a lament about the dating woes in the black professional world, one in which women seem to far outnumber men. That was certainly true at the Judson Grill, where every man was surrounded by three or four women.
 Still, the party served its purpose. ''To walk into a room where you are the majority,'' Ms. Alexander crowed happily, ''is such a refreshing change.''

HEADLINE: The Art of Hiding Among the Figs

BYLINE: By Daniel Akst. 
Daniel Akst is a journalist and novelist who writes often about business. E-mail: culmoney@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
WHAT do MGM Mirage's planned acquisition of the Mandalay Resort Group, the enormous pay package of Richard A. Grasso and the toothless boards at mutual funds have in common? 
 The answer is fig leaves. Like the Victorians, who preferred that nude statues wear at least this small emblem of modesty, contemporary Americans regularly hide the ungainly corpus of their business practices behind similar veils. 
 Consider the MGM-Mandalay merger. Big takeovers like this one are usually accompanied by a ''fairness opinion'' that helps sanctify the deal; in this case, it was provided to MGM Mirage by Morgan Stanley. Nobody should put much stock in such opinions; it was Morgan Stanley, after all, that provided a fairness opinion to Time Warner when it was about to be acquired by America Online. Look how that deal worked out. 
 Fairness opinions are popular with corporate directors as possible shields against legal challenges that might arise from disgruntled shareholders in the wake of a merger. The NASD, which regulates brokerage firms, has begun an inquiry into possible conflicts of interest by the companies that issue them, and is developing new rules to avert such conflicts. 
 But even if glaring conflicts are rooted out, most fairness opinions will be no more than fig leaves. A deal may look fair and actually be awful for shareholders, or look unfair and turn out to be great. The opinion of some hired investment bank is not likely to make much of a difference.
 Gigantic executive paychecks need a fig leaf, too, and compensation consultants provide it. In the case of the $139.5 million pay package for Mr. Grasso, the former chairman of the New York Stock Exchange (he is considering suing for an additional $48 million he says he is owed), Mercer Human Resources was the compensation consultant. When Eliot Spitzer, the New York State attorney general, challenged what he called ''a wholly inappropriate and illegal compensation package,'' Mercer agreed to return the fees it charged the stock exchange in 2003.
 The compensation committees of corporate boards, which may give the appearance of deliberation while rubber-stamping huge executive pay packages, belong in a special category of human fig leaves. Many mutual fund directors are in the same category; for the most part, they preserve the fiction that someone not beholden to the fund company is looking out for investor interests.
 In fact, once you start looking for them, fig leaves turn up everywhere. Stock options not counted as expenses are a fig leaf for lavish executive giveaways. Recycling is a thin fig leaf, indeed, for a nation of sprawling suburbs and hulking sport utility vehicles. 
 The tax system is practically a fig tree; the corporate income tax, for example, lets us pretend we are taxing corporations when in fact we are taxing the people who own them. And keeping the Social Security tax separate is a fig leaf to maintain faith in the idea that our tax system is progressive. (It's not, if you count Social Security taxes.)
 Many fig leaves in business exist to keep lawyers at bay. Consider the myriad risk factors cited in prospectuses for new stock issues. Such offerings are risky, of course. But anyone who really paid attention to the list of potential woes in the offering documents would never invest in any of them. 
 Similarly, there are warnings all over the products you buy, and even about their packaging.
 The problem is that when there are so many fig leaves, they seem to disappear. They're still there, of course, but after a while, we just stop seeing them.
 But their importance goes beyond providing a shield against liability, which mainly concerns the parties directly involved. For the rest of society, fig leaves help maintain the illusion of innocence; they appeal to our sense of modesty about ourselves and the way things really work. They prevent embarrassment, even when people ought to be ashamed. 
 BUT if the system works, why give a fig? Because fig leaves also make it easy to overlook what they cannot adequately disguise: the emperor's nakedness. 
 In the world of business, at least, wouldn't it be better to strip away all this foliage and lay bare what's really happening? Without the screen of a fig leaf, it might be easier for all parties to see who is getting the green.


CORRECTION-DATE: July 11, 2004

 CORRECTION:
The On the Contrary column on June 27, about possible ways to paint rosy pictures of business decisions, misstated the role of Mercer Human Resource Consulting in the pay package of Richard A. Grasso, former chairman of the New York Stock Exchange. It was one of several consultants to the exchange about the package, not the only one.

HEADLINE: Up, Yes. But How Much, How Fast?

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
ENJOY it while it lasts, because there may never be another time when money is this cheap.
 Having cut interest rates to their lowest level in more than 40 years, the Federal Reserve is expected to start raising them again at its policy meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday.
 In some ways, the rate increases may amount to a final exam for Alan Greenspan, who, at 78, has been the Fed chairman for 17 years. Mr. Greenspan, who is expected to retire when his term as a Fed governor ends on Jan. 31, 2006, has already steered the economy through two recessions, three wars, a stock market crash, a bubble and a bust, and the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.
 He must now wean the nation from a historic borrowing binge that he consciously fostered to fight off a trifecta of recession, terrorism and war. And he must do so smack in the middle of a closely contested presidential campaign that will turn at least in part on perceptions of economic well-being. 
 The big question is not whether rates will rise, but how much and how fast. Mr. Greenspan, acutely aware that abrupt rate increases in 1994 led to considerable economic pain, has made it clear that he wants to move more slowly this time.
 But many experts worry that the Fed has already waited too long, contending that higher inflation is at hand. If so, Mr. Greenspan may have to move more quickly and less gently than he has apparently been hoping.
 Even though Mr. Greenspan's political standing has never been higher -- Democrats and Republicans overwhelmingly supported his appointment to a fifth term as chairman -- he has come in for continuous second-guessing and criticism among bond traders and investors who contend that he has fallen ''behind the curve'' on inflation.
 NO matter who is right, the meeting this week will in some ways mark the end of an era. Borrowing costs have been lower than at almost any point in American history. Adjusted for inflation, the real federal funds rate, the rate charged on overnight loans of bank reserves, has been below zero for the last two years; it is now at minus 2 percent.
 Consumers, able to borrow more money without higher monthly payments, have responded in force. Mortgage debt has soared at double-digit percentage rates for the last two years, climbing $1 trillion in the last year alone.
 Americans borrowed to buy new houses or to improve their old ones. By refinancing at lower rates, they extracted cash to buy furniture and appliances. Using either their home-equity loans or zero-interest loans from car companies, they bought record numbers of cars, pickups and sport utility vehicles.
 By all accounts, consumer spending propped up the economy at a time when businesses felt too shell-shocked to invest in new equipment or to hire more workers.
 Although low interest rates have kept monthly debt payments low, people with adjustable-rate loans may feel a pinch in the months and years ahead.
 ''Households are clearly in a very substantial debt hole and looking at the prospect of borrowing on more expensive terms in the future,'' said Tom Schlesinger, executive director of the Financial Markets Center, a nonprofit research group in Philomont, Va. ''The Fed is basically gambling that business investment and the labor markets recover enough to handle that load.''
 So far, the strategy has worked. Business investment revived last summer. The economy, which lost more than two million jobs in the first three years of President Bush's term, has created nearly a million since January. There are also preliminary indications that wages, stagnant for some time, are about to rise as companies hire more aggressively.
 The timing could benefit President Bush's re-election effort. Although many voters remain anxious about the economy, the long-delayed upturn in jobs has already weakened Democratic accusations that Mr. Bush has the worst record on jobs since Herbert Hoover.
 Even if rising interest rates slow the housing market before the election, most economists predict that they will not dampen economic growth or job creation until long after the votes have been cast.
 Much has changed since the Fed moved to pre-empt a rise in consumer prices 10 years ago. Inflation dropped so low last year that officials worried about the opposite, much thornier problem -- a Japanese-style deflation. Productivity, a measure of the goods and services that workers produce each hour, has been climbing more than twice as fast as it did in 1994.
 Perhaps most important, the Fed has labored mightily to take the surprise out of any policy change. More than six months ago, in speeches and policy statements, Fed officials began telegraphing the possibility of rate increases.
 The idea, of course, is to keep financial markets from being spooked. To that end, Mr. Greenspan and others have developed a litany of catch phrases to signal changes in their outlook, from keeping rates low for ''a considerable period,'' to being merely ''patient,'' to calling for a ''measured'' pace of rate increases.
 Beyond the elliptical phrases, which resemble nothing so much as communication by cue cards, Fed officials have made it clear that their decisions will be driven by specific changes: a rise in employment, stronger business investment and greater ''pricing power'' for companies -- meaning that they can charge more for what they sell.
 ''The Fed has become far better at communications,'' said Robert Gay, a former Fed staff member who is now a senior economist at Commerzbank Securities in New York. ''Some of their speeches have been brilliant. They have gone through the issues, point by point.''
 Fed officials contend that the high level of household debt is not an economic concern. Because housing prices have climbed at double-digit annual rates in many markets, they say, household assets have climbed even faster than debt, and net worth has rebounded to record levels.
 ''Many people have gone from being renters to homeowners,'' Mr. Greenspan said recently. ''I don't think their financial condition should be considered worse as a result.''
 What worries top Fed officials much more is the specter of rising consumer prices. Senior officials admit that they were surprised by unexpectedly big jumps in consumer prices in February and March.
 And though Mr. Greenspan continues to say that inflation pressures are not yet a ''serious concern,'' he rattled investors earlier this month by acknowledging that he could be wrong and would change course if he was.
 Many economists now say that he was wrong, and that the central bank has been too cautious. Higher prices for raw materials now appear to be affecting consumer prices, they say, and rising employment is expected to put upward pressure on wages.
 ''I THINK they are behind the curve, but I don't think it's unusual for them to let the market lead them up,'' said Allan H. Meltzer, an economics professor at Carnegie Mellon University and author of a new history of the central bank. ''It's not unusual for them to be slow to change at turning points.''
 Though Mr. Greenspan adamantly opposes setting any official inflation target, Fed officials have implicitly aimed to keep core inflation near 2 percent.
 That leads to the Fed's second big concern: avoiding the kind of disruption that occurred in 1994, when the central bank decided to head off inflation by doubling the federal funds rate, to 6 percent, in a single year.
 Since early May, Mr. Greenspan and others have sought to reassure investors that the Fed could afford to raise interest rates at a ''measured pace.'' That has been interpreted as a series of quarter-point increases that might bring the Fed funds rate to 2.5 percent by early next year from 1 percent today. Many economists have said that short-term rates ultimately need to climb to at least 4 or 5 percent before monetary policy becomes ''neutral,'' neither contributing to inflation nor stalling growth. That reflects an assumption that the American economy can grow about 3 percent a year once it reaches full employment, and that the Fed will tolerate inflation of about 2 percent.
 In theory, that calculation could push rates on 30-year mortgages, which have already jumped in anticipation of higher rates, to 8 percent or higher from about 6.3 percent today. In practice, economists say that anything is possible.
 J.Bradford DeLong, a professor of economics at the University of California at Berkeley, said he thought inflation would remain low for some time because there were still large numbers of unemployed workers. The nation has one million fewer jobs today, he said, than it did when employment peaked four years ago. In addition, he said, the adult population in the United States has expanded by about 1.4 million a year over the last four years.
 ''We are still five to six million jobs below where we should be,'' Mr. DeLong said, even if one assumes that many adults will choose not to work. ''We are still very short of reaching potential output.''
 That is clearly the view of Mr. Greenspan and other Fed governors, all of whom have argued at length that the economy still has considerable ''slack'' and that recent jumps in consumer prices are based on passing events rather than long-term inflationary pressures.
 But many economists disagree. Richard J. DeKaser, chief economist at National City Bank in Cleveland, said forecasters had become lulled by an unusual confluence of factors that kept inflation low in the 1990's. He said that health care costs, a large component of labor costs, climbed slowly in the 1990's but were now rising again at double-digit rates.
 COMPANIES also saved billions of dollars on contributions to pension plans in the 1990's, because the stock market bubble pushed up equity values so much that pension funds had more than enough to meet their obligations. Today, corporations face shortfalls totaling tens of billions of dollars.
 Stock options helped to keep salaries down, too, particularly at technology companies, but options have fallen out of favor as corporate governance has drawn more scrutiny and skepticism about the stock market has risen.
 ''A lot of issues helped restrain labor costs, but they are all going the other direction now,'' Mr. DeKaser said.
 On balance, Mr. Greenspan and other top Fed officials appear to be more optimistic that inflation will remain low, and hence more willing to keep rates low, than many people in the financial markets. Indeed, grumbling by many bond investors has reached a low roar, with complaints that the central bank has been complacent. But Mr. Greenspan has made his reputation by challenging conventional wisdom and often being right.
 The Fed infuriated many investors in 1994 and 1995 by raising the federal funds rate to 6 percent from 3 percent. That caused havoc for banks and financial institutions, which had been holding large volumes of long-term bonds at low rates. But the rate increases ultimately proved a huge success. Brief hints of inflation in early 1994 soon dissipated and long-term interest rates declined as investors became more convinced that inflation would remain low. 
 That set the stage for a six-year economic boom with low inflation, the first successful ''soft landing,'' the gradual slowdown that many economists had thought was impossible to orchestrate. 
 ''They prevented an inflation that seemed to me very likely at the time,'' said Mr. Meltzer at Carnegie Mellon. ''It was the first real countercyclical policy to head off inflation.''
 Today, Mr. Greenspan is on the dovish side of conventional wisdom. Determined to combat an extraordinary series of economic shocks -- a recession, the collapse of the stock-market bubble, the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, a flood of corporate accounting scandals and the war in Iraq -- the Fed has made the cost of borrowing cheaper for a longer time than at almost any point in history.
 THIS month, at a Senate confirmation hearing where he was being considered for a fifth term as Fed chairman, Mr. Greenspan was asked what he viewed as his greatest challenge ahead.
 The answer, he said, was to find a way to remove the ''increasingly unnecessary accommodative policy'' of the last few years. Resorting to golf jargon for a ball that ends up just inches away from the cup, he conceded that it was not ''a gimmeputt.''

A Shock Jock Voting Bloc?
 SWING voters may be in relatively short supply this year, but they definitely exist, and a surprising number of them may be listening to Howard Stern on their way to church.
 A new analysis found that 21 percent of voters were either undecided or so tentatively committed to one presidential candidate that they would be willing to reconsider. That is low compared with the share of voters up for grabs at this point in past elections -- 33 percent in 2000, 27 percent in 1996 and 31 percent in 1992 -- but enough to give one candidate a decisive victory. 
 ''People have been saying that this election will be a repeat of what we saw four years ago, but there is still a sizable number of voters with a favorable view of both candidates,'' said Andrew Kohut, the director of the nonpartisan Pew Research Center for the People and the Press, which conducted the analysis. ''The election might be close, but a candidate who did a really good job of reaching these persuadable voters could win by a gap of five percentage points or more.''
 Unfortunately for Republicans, a lot of these voters tune their radios to Mr. Stern, who has been crusading to oust President Bush. Mr. Stern is angry at the Federal Communications Commission, which cracked down on stations that broadcast a show of his that discussed anal sex and what the commission called ''repeated flatulence sound effects.''
 Mr. Stern, who has backed Republican candidates in the past, has a mother lode of swing voters in his audience, according to a poll by the New Democrat Network, an advocacy group. Its pollster, Mark Penn, calculates that this ''Stern Gang'' of swing voters makes up 4 percent of the likely voters this year, nearly as large as the entire Hispanic vote in 2000.
 But one bit of solace for Republicans is that Mr. Stern's listeners go to church frequently, which tends to correlate with voting Republican. The poll showed that Mr. Stern's listeners were slightly more likely than nonlisteners to call themselves born-again Christians and were three times more likely to attend church daily. The pollsters did not ask why they went to church after listening to Mr. Stern, so there is no way to calculate how many were performing an act of contrition.

Bite the Hand, If You Dare
 HOW do Republicans opposed to big government stop themselves before they spend again? They had a much-anticipated opportunity in the wee hours of Friday morning, when the House voted on a bill supported by Republican leaders and the White House that imposed strict limits on future budgets. But Republicans joined with Democrats to defeat it.
 That vote has some conservatives seeking a novel and more personal method of restraint: booting dispensers of largesse from coveted jobs on the Appropriations Committee. One way of removing spenders comes from Trent Franks, a Republican congressman from Arizona, who last year proposed prohibiting anyone from serving on the committee for more than 6 years in any 10-year period. Mr. Franks called it a ''preventative measure that will allow fresh idealism into the appropriations process.''
 So far his proposal has gone nowhere in the House -- few members want to lead the charge against the committee that doles out money to their home districts -- but it has been endorsed by one influential Republican, Grover Norquist. He is the president of Americans for Tax Reform, which has persuaded 217 of the 435 House members to pledge not to raise income taxes.
 ''Now that we've effectively blocked them from raising taxes, we want a way to limit spending,'' Mr. Norquist said. ''Under the current system, once you get on the Appropriations Committee, you're permanently defined as a spender. By limiting those appointments to six years, you'd change the incentive structure because no one would be a spender for their entire career. You could be celebrated as a guy who fought against spending.''
 An even more effective way to stop spending, Mr. Norquist said, is an idea he got from staff members of the Appropriations Committee (who understandably are remaining anonymous). Knowing the House's habit of setting a cap on the budget and then disregarding it, they suggested passing a rule requiring the chairman to step down if the final budget exceeded the cap.
 ''At first the chairman wouldn't like being the one accountable, but in fact it would empower him,'' Mr. Norquist said. ''Any time he walked into a room to negotiate with members of the House or the Senate who want to spend more money, he could say, 'You know and I know that you know that I'm not walking out the door and losing my job.'''
 Those arguments did not appeal to the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, C.W. Bill Young of Florida. ''Grover's heart is in the right place when he tries to control spending, but I can't be supportive at all of that proposal,'' Mr. Young said. ''There shouldn't be any automatic exercise to change the chairman. But I can tell you there are many times when the chairman would like another job. It's very frustrating to be haggling over the budget.''

For Richer, at Least For Uncle Sam
 ANOTHER new way to cut federal spending emerged last week, although it's not one that many Republicans are likely to endorse. The Congressional Budget Office concluded that allowing same-sex marriage would slightly reduce the budget deficit every year for the next decade.
 Some opponents of same-sex marriage have complained that it would confer costly new benefits, Social Security payments to a widow or widower. But the budget office estimates that those costs would be relatively low. In heterosexual marriages, a wife typically outlives her husband by six or seven years (both because women are generally younger than their husbands and because women outlive men), but gay partners are usually about the same age and have a similar life expectancy. 
 The extra Social Security payments would be more than offset by the income taxes that gays would pay because of the so-called marriage penalty, the budget office estimates, and there would be other savings because fewer gays would qualify for Medicaid and federal benefits once spouses' incomes were factored in. The net annual gain to the government would be about $750 million by 2011.

HEADLINE: The Phantom of the Fed

BYLINE: By DANIEL GROSS. 
Daniel Gross writes the ''Moneybox'' column for Slate.com.

 BODY:
EARLY this week, the Federal Reserve Board will raise the federal funds rate, breaking the seal on the worst-kept secret since the Marc Anthony-Jennifer Lopez wedding.
 During the past year, the Fed kept rates low even as the economy expanded and as signs of rising prices -- in oil, rolled steel and Upper East Side co-ops -- became more evident. The reason was that Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, and his colleagues feared the specter of deflation. And it seemed that they had good reason to do so. 
 The core Consumer Price Index, which excludes volatile energy and food prices, was falling sharply, to a year-over-year rate of 1.1 percent in December 2003 from 2.7 percent in November 2001. That usually does not happen when the economy is accelerating out of a recession, and signs of unwanted slack abounded, from the labor market to industrial capacity. 
 But in recent months, a chorus of voices, including some within the Federal Reserve, has suggested that technology, globalization and the Fed's own recent aggressive actions may have skewed the numbers on which it relies. 
 Consider capacity utilization, a measure of how much of the nation's industrial infrastructure is being used. The Fed reported that this figure was 77.8 percent in May, up from 74.1 percent in May 2003, but significantly below the recent historical average of 81.1 percent -- from 1972 to 2003.
 In the past, low industrial capacity rates meant that a large number of factories were off line, often temporarily. 
 But in May, Anthony M. Santomero, a Fed governor, suggested in a speech that ''with the recent pace of technological change, a disproportionate share of that stock may be obsolete.'' And if that is the case, he said, ''the true degree of slack in industrial capacity, and hence the downward pressure on inflation, may be overstated.'' 
 He has a point. The problems affecting manufacturing in recent years have not been cyclical, as they may have been in the past; they are structural. The manufacturing capacity of Pennsylvania, Ohio and much of the world is moving to places like Shenzhen. Many textile and steel factories that are idle today may be permanently mothballed, or simply broken down and placed on fast boats to China.
 ''To the extent anyone is pointing to capacity utilization as a reason why you don't have to worry about inflation, they're frozen in time,'' said Lakshman Achuthan, managing director at the Economic Cycle Research Institute in New York.
 What's more, an alternate measure of capacity utilization shows significantly less slack. Twice each year, the Institute of Supply Management surveys 400 manufacturing companies and asks what percentage of their capacity is in use. In April, the figure stood at 85.6 percent, up sharply from 80.1 percent in December 2003.
 Questions have also been raised about the Consumer Price Index. In a working paper published in April, three researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta -- Andrew Bauer, Nicholas Haltom and William Peterman -- broke the price index into its constituent parts. They found that unusual activity in just two components -- housing rents and used-car prices -- accounted for nearly 70 percent of the decline in the core index. 
 Paradoxically, the Fed's prolonged restraint of interest rates to forestall deflation may have helped tamp down the inflation measure in the price index. 
 Low interest rates make buying a home more attractive, and renting a home or apartment less attractive. So in the past few years, home prices have risen while apartment rents have fallen. 
 But the price index gauges housing costs by using a rental-equivalent approach, which measures, as the working paper put it, ''the value of the shelter services an owner receives from his or her home.'' As a result, ''price movements in owner's equivalent rent reflect changes in prices of rental units that are comparable in characteristics to owner-occupied homes.'' 
 In other words, the index more closely tracks rent than housing prices. Declines in rent alone accounted for half of the 1.6-percentage-point decline in core inflation from November 2001 to December 2003. 
 SOME economists view this as a sign that the price index isn't capturing the true state of the economy. 
 ''Housing prices are increasing at anywhere between 6 and 12 percent annually, and that's not showing up in the C.P.I.,'' said Brian Wesbury, chief economist at Griffin, Kubik, Stevens & Thompson, a research firm in Chicago. 
 Low interest rates have also helped stimulate record sales of new cars. But when new cars are plentiful and comparatively cheap, prices for used cars fall. The Atlanta economists conclude that falling prices for sedans and S.U.V.'s accounted for 0.3 percent of that 1.6 percent decline in core inflation.
 Mr. Santomero and the Atlanta researchers did not suggest that Mr. Greenspan missed the boat on inflation by relying on figures and measures that might be outdated or misleading. Nonetheless, their musings and research suggest that, when it came to the threat of deflation, Mr. Greenspan and his colleagues might have been in the grip of irrational pessimism for much of the past year.

HEADLINE: Veterans' Health Care

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 ''Dogfights in the Senate'' (editorial, June 25) underestimates the crisis within the veterans' health care system. Because White House financing requests have lagged behind increases in V.A. enrollment and health care inflation, the V.A. spends just 38 percent of what it spent in 1996. In turn, the Bush administration has placed hundreds of thousands of veterans on waiting lists, increased copays and blocked 360,000 veterans from entering the V.A. at all. 
 The strains on the V.A. budget will worsen when the soldiers serving in Iraq and elsewhere leave the military and enter the V.A. system. Far from being ''last minute,'' my amendment to finance veterans' health care fully was similar to the bill I introduced on the first day of the 108th Congress and the product of months of discussions and research. It had the backing of every major veterans organization.
 While I would welcome the chance to fully debate and vote on a freestanding veterans' health bill, the Republican leadership in the Senate has shown no inclination to address this issue. Regrettably, my amendment earlier this week could be the Senate's only opportunity to consider such a proposal this year.
 I was proud to offer the amendment, and I will seek out opportunities to do so again.

HEADLINE: Candidates in Canadian Vote Are Poised for a Dead Heat

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

DATELINE: TORONTO, June 26 

 BODY:
When the Toronto Blue Jays invited all the major candidates for prime minister to take part in throwing out the first ball at a game this week, campaign advisers agonized over the implications of an embarrassing bobble on the mound, a wild pitch or unrelenting jeers from the bleachers.
 In the end, only the Conservative leader, Stephen Harper, agreed to throw, and his off-speed pitch over the plate rewarded him with front-page photographs making him look robust only days before the June 28 parliamentary election.
 Though it was a rare spontaneous moment in an otherwise controlled campaign, Mr. Harper's walk to the mound was symbolic. Unlike the last three landslide Liberal victories in national elections since 1993, the vote on Monday is anybody's ballgame. A variety of polls show Prime Minister Paul Martin's Liberals and Mr. Harper's Conservatives virtually tied, with neither party likely to win more than 35 percent of the vote. 
 The result is likely to produce a lot of political uncertainty, with a shaky minority government depending for survival on two third parties, the labor-aligned New Democratic Party and the separatist Bloc Quebecois. Whether the Conservatives or Liberals win control of the House of Commons, either side will need to make compromises to remain in power that are likely to have an important impact on social policy and relations with the United States.
 Both the New Democratic Party and the Bloc Quebecois oppose Mr. Martin's willingness to enter into negotiations with the Bush administration to take part in a continental missile defense system. They both want Canada to take a more aggressive stance in trade negotiations with the United States to reduce American tariffs on softwood lumber. The New Democrats, who are suspicious of free trade, would go so far as to link energy exports to lumber exports.
 Both parties support legislation to legalize possession of marijuana, strengthen environmental protection and extend gay rights.
 The Bloc Quebecois is poised to sweep Quebec and become a power broker in Ottawa for the first time. It can be expected to use its position to advance its separatist cause for Quebec. But as a party that supports free trade and strong local government, it could serve as a useful if unlikely ally to the Conservative Party despite broad differences of opinion on many social and economic issues.
 In an interview on his campaign bus in Montreal, the Bloc Quebecois leader, Gilles Duceppe, said he would work with any governing party on issues of mutual concern. 
 ''If it's good for Quebec, we'll support it,'' he said. ''If it isn't, we will not.'' He said the Bloc would push legislation to increase federal financing for health care and to fight organized crime gangs.
 Alain G. Gagnon, chairman of Quebec and Canadian Studies at the University of Quebec in Montreal, said the Bloc would be taking a risk if it appeared to be strengthening either the Conservatives or the Liberals.
 ''The day they are viewed as a collaborationist party, it will mean the undermining of the raison d'etre of the party itself,'' he said.
 The New Democratic Party leader, Jack Layton, has attacked Mr. Martin hard during the campaign. But Mr. Layton's party could prop up a Liberal minority government in exchange for increased aid to cities and a halt to privatization of health care services. He would also press for a sweeping change in election law that would give third parties proportional representation in future parliaments.
 In a telephone interview, Mr. Layton refused to speculate on possible negotiations with a future governing party, but was openly gleeful about the prospects of a minority government he might be able to influence. 
 ''Canada's minority governments of the past have produced remarkably good legislation,'' he noted, including sweeping health care, pension and housing programs.
 But while there have been nine minority governments since 1921, few have lasted very long before they lost confidence votes in the Parliament and were forced to call new elections. The last minority government, in 1979, survived six months.
 Newspaper columnists and broadcast commentators are already speculating about how the next government could fall in a matter of months. It is even possible, some note, that both Mr. Harper and Mr. Martin could both form governments and serve as prime minister before the next election.
 ''Few scenarios can lead to another election in more than 12 months,'' predicted Pierre Martin, a political scientist at the University of Quebec.
 When he replaced Prime Minister Jean Chretien in December, Mr. Martin was far ahead in opinion polls. But soon after he took office, the auditor general released an audit charging the Liberal government with spreading tens of millions of dollars to advertising firms that give donations to the governing party as part of a campaign to stymie separatist forces in Quebec.
 The scandal caused a furor across Canada, and Mr. Harper's Conservatives catapulted to the lead in polls. But the race has drawn closer in recent days as he was embarrassed by missteps including a campaign press release suggesting that Mr. Martin condoned child pornography.
 With all the uncertainty, it is unclear how the next government will deal with the United States on efforts to settle various trade disputes and to cooperate on security, including a continental missile defense system.
 ''A minority government will be focused on surviving and unable to take any significant initiatives,'' predicted Robert A. Pastor, director of the Center for North American Studies at American University in Washington. ''It will be equivalent to a divided and stalemated government, not unlike Mexico's today.''


CORRECTION-DATE: June 28, 2004

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article yesterday about the Canadian voting scheduled for today misstated the affiliation of Pierre Martin, a political scientist who doubted that the next election would be more than 12 months away. He is at the University of Montreal, not the University of Quebec.

HEADLINE: The Yin, the Yang and the Deal

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS Jr.

 BODY:
STANDING before his most senior executives in a packed room last week, William B. Harrison Jr., the chief executive of J.P. Morgan Chase, was doing what he loves best: selling a merger. Just eight days remained before the official union of J.P. Morgan and Bank One -- a combination that will create the world's second-largest financial institution, after Citigroup, bring James Dimon back to Wall Street and cap a long, sometimes painful journey for Mr. Harrison.
 His jacket off, his glasses riding low on his nose, Mr. Harrison ranged back and forth behind the lectern for close to 45 minutes. For inspiration, he cited the teamwork of the Detroit Pistons in upsetting the Los Angeles Lakers this year for the N.B.A. championship; for laughs, he played a 19-year-old video showing David Letterman, then at NBC, breaking into the General Electric building in a vain but hilarious attempt to meet his new boss, John F. Welch Jr., the chief executive of G.E. who had just bought NBC.
 ''The Pistons didn't have anyone,'' Mr. Harrison said, his voice rising. ''A team beats superstars every time -- that's execution. The difference between good and great is going to be execution. Let's be the best. With that, Jamie, I turn it over to you.'' 
 Leaping up from his front-row seat, Mr. Dimon reached to shake his boss's proffered hand, then pulled his own hand back sharply with a grin. For a few seconds, Mr. Harrison's hand remained outstretched as Mr. Dimon bounded past him.
 The gesture was a joke, a playful take on the video, in which Mr. Letterman's offered hand was also spurned by security guards -- ''the G.E. corporate handshake,'' Mr. Letterman called it. But while Mr. Dimon clearly meant no disrespect for Mr. Harrison, a man he often praises as a friend and a business partner, his clumsy prank underscored just how delicate -- and unusual -- this merger is. 
 Mr. Harrison may be the acquirer and the chief executive in name, but it is becoming increasingly clear that Mr. Dimon and his posse will call many of the shots. A majority of that group worked with Mr. Dimon at Citigroup during his glory days as Sanford I. Weill's No.2.
 Odd as it may seem, J.P. Morgan, the prestigious 200-year-old financial institution that has catered to the Rockefellers and the cream of corporate America, is on the verge of being swallowed by a bank from Chicago with roots in Columbus, Ohio. 
 The merger, which becomes official on Thursday, comes at a difficult time for Wall Street, amid rising interest rates, shrinking trading profits, increased regulatory scrutiny and a wave of lawsuits related to corporate missteps and scandals. 
 All of that puts added pressure on the relationship between Mr. Dimon and Mr. Harrison and their ability to oversee a smooth transition while generating the profits and the big deals that investors demand. 
 Generally, the chief executive doing the buying -- in this case Mr. Harrison, who paid $58 billion for Bank One -- would be the one burrowing into the nooks and crannies of the acquired business, placing his people in charge and presiding over an exodus of lame-duck executives. That is what happened when Mr. Harrison, then the chief executive of Chase Manhattan, bought J.P. Morgan in 2000 for $35 billion. Within months, Douglas A. Warner III, the chief executive of J.P. Morgan, and many of his senior bankers departed, leaving Mr. Harrison and his crew in charge.
 But this time, it is Mr. Dimon who is doing the heavy lifting. And that is just how Mr. Harrison planned it. Mr. Dimon will plumb the operational depths of the new entity as president and take over as chief executive two years later. That frees Mr. Harrison for other pursuits, like his trip last week to Beijing, where he rubbed shoulders with members of J.P. Morgan's advisory council, including two former secretaries of state, Henry A. Kissinger and George P. Shultz. 
 THAT is not to say that Mr. Harrison has been detached. He meets with Mr. Dimon daily. He has also led all the bank's in-house leadership training sessions, which he set up in 2002 and modeled after Mr. Welch's highly regarded program at G.E.
 So far, the bloody purges that characterize most mergers are lacking. There has been just one significant departure: Donald H. Layton. He was not only a J.P. Morgan man, as vice chairman for risk and finance, but he had also been a member of Mr. Harrison's inner circle since 1991. 
 Mr. Dimon, who has been in New York since early May, recently moved into Mr. Layton's spacious office on the executive floor of J.P. Morgan's headquarters on Park Avenue in Midtown Manhattan and is working 12-hour days as he explores the complex financial institution that he will inherit in two years. 
 For two men who are expected to work so closely together until then, Mr. Dimon and Mr. Harrison present a striking contrast in styles, personalities and backgrounds.
 Mr. Harrison, 60, whose father and grandfather were bankers in Rocky Mount, N.C., is an amiable but distant man, who with his soft Southern accent and dignified manner might well have stepped out of a Walker Percy novel. His harder-edged peers sometimes refer to him as the last gentleman on Wall Street, representative of a less rapacious era.
 He says he was never bent on a Wall Street career. But after he entered the training program at Chemical Bank in 1967, he never returned to North Carolina. Over the next 37 years, his small-town-banker demeanor helped him survive internal battles and a series of mergers to become chief executive of Chase Manhattan in 1999.
 Mr. Harrison embarked on his own takeover spree, spending more than $41 billion on acquisitions, culminating in the ill-timed merger with J.P. Morgan in 2000, just before the stock market collapsed.
 Then there is Mr. Dimon, who is 48. His grandfather immigrated from Greece to New York City in 1919 and worked his way up from dishwasher to stockbroker. Mr. Dimon's father, also a broker, is approaching his 50th anniversary at Smith Barney. 
 While Mr. Harrison's Wall Street career may have been accidental, Mr. Dimon's seemed preordained. ''I was reading annual reports in high school,'' he said.
 It was through his father that he met Mr. Weill, and he went to work for him during Mr. Weill's last days at American Express. He stayed with him as Mr. Weill built his second financial colossus, starting with a second-tier consumer finance company in Baltimore and ending with today's Citigroup.
 Mr. Dimon's ability to deconstruct balance sheets and cut costs endeared him to Mr. Weill during his spree of takeovers, but it was his deal-making acumen and TV anchorman looks that attracted a cultlike following in the later years. Even now, as Mr. Dimon strides about his new home on Park Avenue, popping unannounced into the offices of surprised executives, his aura remains intact.
 ''The guy is a rock star,'' said James B. Lee Jr., a vice chairman of J.P. Morgan Chase, as he recounted how Mr. Dimon helped land a big underwriting deal recently, even before the merger becomes official. 
 But the merger gives Mr. Harrison and Mr. Dimon more than a chance to flex larger muscles in the financial arena. It also offers both the promise of redemption. 
 After he was fired by Mr. Weill in a power struggle in 1998, Mr. Dimon abandoned Wall Street. He began his comeback by taking over Bank One; now he will be challenging his former mentor's company for supremacy. 
 Mr. Harrison, for his part, has endured two years of negative publicity as J.P. Morgan's stock plunged to a low of $16, down 70 percent from its high of $52 in early 2001, because of its broad exposure to Enron and imploding telecommunications companies. In Mr. Dimon, he may have found an ideal successor -- a Wall Street hero who can recharge J.P. Morgan's flagging reputation among investors. 
 Although his board stood by him through the brutal times, Mr. Harrison acknowledged that he had a limited time to turn things around. ''If we had gone another year without performing, the board probably would have demanded changes,'' he said, leaning back in a plush chair in his office. ''There is a point at which you can't go on. But in the end, I presume that they liked my leadership.''
 Mr. Harrison sought counsel from a small group of people, most prominently Mr. Welch, who had been advising him on a range of matters since 2002. Mr. Welch refuses to take any credit for the merger, but he said he spent lots of time on the phone with Mr. Harrison as he contemplated combining with Bank One.
 ''He is a strong and principled guy,'' Mr. Welch said of Mr. Harrison, by phone from Beijing. ''Bill always does the right thing. He was willing to merge the bank and maybe leave earlier than he had planned.''
 But not too early.
 During the negotiations with Mr. Dimon, he fought hard to give himself the two extra years, to secure a smooth transition, although he may have cost J.P. Morgan shareholders extra money in doing so. Mr. Dimon, always the tough deal maker, offered to do the deal for no premium if he could become chief executive immediately, according to two people close to the deal.
 When Mr. Harrison resisted, Mr. Dimon insisted on a premium, which Mr. Harrison was able to push down to 14 percent. The two men declined to comment on the specifics of their negotiations.
 In addition to holding their strategic discussions, Mr. Welch and Mr. Harrison spent significant time together honing the executive training program at J.P. Morgan. Mr. Welch was particularly impressed with Mr. Harrison's use of a group exercise in which senior J.P. Morgan executives, including Mr. Harrison, wrote on a board the personal and professional experiences -- the more painful the better -- that helped them to evolve as people. ''Bill was very good at it,'' Mr. Welch said. ''It makes you become simpatico with the guy.''
 Mr. Harrison takes his reputation as a merger connoisseur seriously, and he is sensitive to claims by some analysts that his deals, conducted at the market's peak, did not serve shareholders well.
 He contends that the merger that created J.P. Morgan Chase was well executed, but that the new entity struggled ''because Enron, telecom and private equity blew up.'' 
 ''So I would say that all of our mergers have been executed well and that needs to be clarified,'' he said. ''This deal will create a higher standard.''
 Still, J.P. Morgan's stock performance remains lackluster, although it has rallied from its lows of two years ago and is now trading at $38. 
 Michael L. Mayo, a banking analyst at Prudential Securities, found that since June 1999, when Mr. Harrison became chief executive, J.P. Morgan's stock has fallen a cumulative 6 percent. It ranked last among 17 bank stocks he examined. In third place was Bank One, which has returned 13 percent since Mr. Dimon became chief in March 2000.
 For the most part, investors have applauded the deal. The addition of Bank One's retail bank network is expected to smooth out J.P. Morgan's earnings, decreasing its exposure to volatile capital markets and bank lending.
 Investors also hope that Mr. Dimon can work his magic again. ''The sense on the street is that the day-to-day operations will be run by Jamie,'' said Robert Maneri, a fund manager at Victory Capital Management in Cleveland, specializing in bank stocks. ''We have a lot of faith in him.''
 Indeed, many major units -- including retail banking, credit cards, risk and technology -- will be run by Mr. Dimon and his team. 
 The two executives who will be in charge of investment banking are from the J.P. Morgan side, but one of them, Steven D. Black, who already held the job, is a longtime friend of Mr. Dimon's dating back to the days the two worked for Mr. Weill at Smith Barney.
 Mr. Dimon is well aware of the pressures that face him. Every Sunday night, he draws up a list of the most unpleasant things he must do the next day; often, they are sensitive personnel matters. ''Making this thing hum is job one right now because that creates other opportunities,'' he said. ''I think we have a fabulous opportunity to make this the best financial service company in the world. But expectations are high. I know that.''
 If he follows through with the $2.2 billion in cost cuts he has promised, the stock will probably move up, giving him the currency to buy what J.P. Morgan now lacks -- a brokerage network and a retail banking presence in Europe or in the fast-growing southeastern United States.
 While analysts expect cost-cutting to drive the stock price, they also warn that J.P. Morgan may need to reserve as much as $3 billion to cover litigation over its involvement in the Enron and WorldCom bankruptcies.
 The stock price is a constant theme in their speeches, but both men say their primary focus now is pulling the two banks together. 
 One recent evening, 200 senior bankers from both companies gathered for a dinner at J.P. Morgan's headquarters, capping a day of corporate-integration meetings. As Mr. Harrison and Mr. Dimon picked at their filet mignon platters, they again found reassurance in Mr. Welch, who appeared on multiple screens surrounding the diners. ''Execute. Get it done,'' Mr. Welch called out to his rapt audience, with his raspy, Back Bay twang, in a recorded video clip. 
 Their dinners finished, Mr. Dimon and Mr. Harrison stepped up to the lectern for a closing interview, conducted by Mr. Lee. ''Tell us some personal things about yourselves, Jamie and Bill,'' Mr. Lee said.
 AFTER a brief pause, Mr. Harrison talked about growing up in North Carolina, coming to New York, all the blind dates he went on before marrying at the age of 42 and how his daughters, 11 and 13, greet him when he arrives home in Greenwich, Conn: ''Hey, Billy boy. How were things at the office?'' 
 As the crowd roared with laughter, Mr. Dimon took his turn. He recalled the reaction of the eldest of his three daughters when he told her that he had been fired from Citigroup. ''Can I have your cellphone now? I guess you won't need it,'' she said.
 For all their differences -- and despite Mr. Dimon's jocular gesture that same afternoon -- the two looked comfortable on stage, a Wall Street version of a two-man vaudeville act. They finished each other's sentences, knew where to go for the laughs and sounded the same themes about the importance of a unified culture to a successful merger. 
 Then Mr. Lee asked the million-dollar question: What about the stock price?
 Mr. Harrison went first, cautiously. ''There is huge upside,'' he said. ''If we start performing, our stock is 45.''
 Without hesitation, Mr. Dimon raised a grander goal. ''If we do our jobs and get the $2.2 billion in cost saves, in five years if the stock is not $100, I will eat my hat,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Crimes of Others Wrecked Enron, Ex-Chief Says

BYLINE: By KURT EICHENWALD

DATELINE: HOUSTON, June 22 

 BODY:
There was a time when Kenneth L. Lay's close relationship with President Bush brought him power and influence in Washington that was virtually unparalleled among his colleagues in corporate America.
 Now, Mr. Lay, the former chairman and chief executive of Enron, fears those ties may serve only to bring him criminal charges. 
 ''If anything, being friends with the Bush family, including the president, has made my situation more difficult,'' Mr. Lay said in a recent interview, ''because it's probably a tougher decision not to indict me than to indict me.'' 
 For more than two years, he has been the nation's silent pariah.
 Now, on the eve of what may be the government's final decision on whether to charge him with a crime, Mr. Lay is talking for the first time about the company's collapse in 2001 and the scandal that enveloped it. In more than six hours of interviews with The New York Times, Mr. Lay remained steadfast in his expressions of innocence, even as he acknowledged, as head of the company, accountability for the debacle rests rightfully with him.
 ''I take full responsibility for what happened at Enron,'' said Mr. Lay, 62. ''But saying that, I know in my mind that I did nothing criminal.''
 As Mr. Lay describes it, the Enron collapse was the outgrowth of the wrong-headed and criminal acts of the company's finance organization, and specifically its chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow. He says that both he and the board were misled by Mr. Fastow about the activities and true nature of a series of off-the-books partnerships that played the decisive role in the company's collapse.
 Yet, Mr. Lay still argues that some of the company's most controversial decisions -- including some that set up financial conflicts of interest for Mr. Fastow that could well be unprecedented in corporate America -- were made for good reasons, and can be seen as mistakes only in hindsight.
 The interview was conducted in Mr. Lay's office in downtown Houston. There, a picture window frames the old Enron skyscraper across town, a sight he said he rarely contemplates during his days working as a consultant for two start-up companies.
 The years since the Enron collapse have transformed Mr. Lay. The changes in his financial status are stunning. At the beginning of 2001, Mr. Lay said, he had a net worth in excess of $400 million -- almost all of it in Enron stock. Today, he says his worth is below $20 million, and his total available cash not earmarked for legal fees or repayment of debt is less than $1 million.
 But the changes amount to more than just money. A man once celebrated in business and political circles, today he is widely vilified as bearing significant responsibility for Enron's downfall, a debacle that cost thousands of employees their jobs, millions of investors their savings, and, for a time, forced a nation to question the capital markets system. He is often portrayed as a man who bailed out of his company as it was sinking, selling millions of shares even while telling investors and employees that he believed in the company's future.
 It is a portrait, he insists, that disregards the realities of Enron's last months, a time in which he describes himself as first working hard to improve the company, then struggling desperately to keep it afloat.

A Reversal of Fortune
 Now, according to witnesses who have testified before the grand jury and other people involved in the investigation, prosecutors are focusing almost exclusively on Mr. Lay's actions and statements in the months preceding bankruptcy, in an effort to determine if he deceived investors about the true state of Enron before its demise even as he was selling his own stock. 
 However, a review of Mr. Lay's financial and trading data shows that the facts are much murkier than is generally believed, with the stock sales being forced by lenders as he took numerous actions that are consistent with someone trying to minimize his sales. 
 To date, numerous executives who worked for or advised Enron have pleaded guilty to crimes or been charged with wrongdoing. Virtually the entire senior management has faced legal proceedings: its treasurer, chief financial officer, primary outside accountant, corporate secretary and even a division head have all pleaded guilty to crimes. Others, including Jeffrey K. Skilling, another former chief executive, and Richard A. Causey, the former chief accounting officer, have been charged with fraud. 
 Mr. Lay himself has remained under investigation that entire time, and -- at what he said was his legal team's insistence -- invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination in testifying before Congress. 
 Mr. Lay said that he had remained silent on the advice of lawyers, but is coming forward now to explain his views of a story that he says has become infused with myths. While not saying so explicitly, he suggested that he was motivated by a desire to tell his side both to the prosecutors on the Justice Department's Enron Task Force who have been investigating him and the citizens of Houston who may well sit in judgment on him. 
 Throughout the interview, Mr. Lay was calm and subdued, an edge appearing in his voice only when he discussed former Enron executives who he said had lied to him, what he perceived as misperceptions about what happened at the company, and the government's decision to investigate him with three successive groups of prosecutors, each going over the same ground.

Assigning Blame
 In the end, Mr. Lay said, the Enron story is one of corrupt executives in a finance organization led by Mr. Fastow, the former chief financial officer, who took advantage of the company for their own personal benefit and ultimately destroyed it. Mr. Fastow has pleaded guilty to fraud and is cooperating with the government. 
 ''At our core, regrettably, we had a chief financial officer and a few other people who, in fact, mismanaged the company's balance sheet and finances and enriched themselves in a way that once we got into a stressful environment in the marketplace, the company collapsed,'' he said. ''But by the same token, most, and I mean 98 percent, of the people who worked at Enron were good, honest, hardworking individuals. They were not crooks.'' 
 Still, Mr. Lay said he clung to a belief that the outcomes of certain corporate decisions that ultimately proved devastating to the company could not have been anticipated. The use of such partnerships was widespread throughout the business world, as corporations attempted to use a technique authorized under the accounting rules to pretty up their reported financial picture. But Enron took those efforts much further, adopting policies that were unheard of, such as allowing Mr. Fastow to operate an off-books investment fund that did business with the company and provided financing for some of the partnerships. 
 Mr. Lay labels criticisms of that set-up as 20-20 hindsight, created only because the world now knows that Mr. Fastow used the vehicles to manipulate Enron's earnings and loot the company, all without his knowledge, Mr. Lay said.
 ''At the time it seemed the appropriate thing to do,'' he said. ''And I had no reason to doubt or distrust Fastow.''
 But legal experts dismiss the entire venture as foolhardy from inception. ''It's just not common sense thinking,'' said John J. Fahy, a former federal prosecutor now with Fahy Choi in Rutherford, N. J. ''Your C.F.O. cannot be put in a position where he is in conflict with the company. He is simply too important. The idea is just crazy.''
 While he has been subjected in recent years to withering personal criticism on Capitol Hill, by the media, on late night talk shows and across the Internet, Mr. Lay said that in his hometown many longtime friends and associates remained supportive, and he continued to serve on multiple charitable boards in town.

In 'The Twilight Zone'
 Still, Mr. Lay said, the event took a toll, disheartening him and his wife, Linda.
 ''Linda kind of likened it not too long ago to being in the show, 'The Twilight Zone,' where you live your whole life'' trying to be ethical and straightforward, Mr. Lay said, ''to almost overnight being referred to in the national media and elsewhere as a kind of pariah on society. And no, that's not any fun.''
 By the summer of 2001, Mr. Lay said, he had turned the chief executive's job over to his hand-picked successor, Mr. Skilling, who built Enron's energy trading business. By the end of that year, Mr. Lay expected to relinquish his title of chairman as well, and take a position with a New York merchant bank.
 Then, Mr. Skilling told Mr. Lay he wanted to resign. With no one in the wings, Mr. Lay informed the merchant bank in August that he could not work there, and returned to Enron as chief executive. His return was greeted with some employees expressing simmering concerns about the way the company was running. Mr. Lay commissioned surveys of employees, and invited them to come speak with him or one of his top executives about any worries.
 The appeals brought in responses from throughout the company, pointing up problems that ranged from serious challenges to significant dangers. Sherron Watkins, an executive who had just sent an anonymous letter to Mr. Lay criticizing some of the off-books entities as improper, came forward to meet with him. Other e-mail messages arrived from current and former executives lambasting and praising the company. Some of those e-mails Mr. Lay said he saw; others, he said, were never shown to him. 
 Those e-mail messages, including one from a former employee named Margaret Ceconi, which Mr. Lay said he never saw until long after Enron's collapse, have been examined by the grand jury, according to witnesses who were questioned. Her memo raised claims of a host of problems, including accounting issues in one of the company's divisions. Prosecutors are apparently trying to prove that the e-mails gave Mr. Lay notice of deep problems at the company. 
 One of the e-mails questioned by the government, from a senior executive named Steven Kean, said the company was perceived as being involved in aggressive accounting and the hyping of new businesses. But the message simultaneously praised Enron's accounting staff and expressed high expectations for growth. 
 ''I looked at that as a very balanced memo,'' Mr. Lay said. ''And when I read that e-mail, I called Steve and told him I didn't disagree with the issues he raised. I thought they were issues that needed to be addressed.'' 
 Mr. Lay said he was impressed by Ms. Watkins, who criticized certain off-books entities, particularly a quartet of entities known as the Raptors, for utilizing what she said was improper accounting intended to bolster Enron's profits in 1999 and 2000. ''I thought she seemed very credible, very smart,'' he said. 
 But that, he said, did not lead him to believe the company was in dire condition.
 ''You just don't read one letter coming from a person in middle management and decide, 'Well, we have a serious problem here,''' he said. 
 Mr. Lay instructed his legal team to bring in Vinson & Elkins, a Houston law firm to investigate; the lawyers concluded there were no significant problems. However, the firm had done legal work on the entities under investigation, and Mr. Lay has been sharply criticized for seeking advice from a conflicted party. But Mr. Lay said that given the gravity of the accusations, he wanted a fast answer, which he thought the firm could provide because of its familiarity with the issues. Indeed, Mr. Lay said, a subsequent review by independent lawyers and accountants, which found serious flaws in the structures, took three months to conclude.
 ''If we'd started that report back in August,'' he said, ''We would have been bankrupt before we got the report back.''
 But at the same time that negative news was coming in, Mr. Lay was hearing positive information about the company. In a September meeting, Mr. Fastow announced that the company balance sheet was stronger than ever. Ben F. Glisan Jr., the treasurer, said Enron's credit rating was likely to be raised in a matter of months. When criticisms of some accounting approaches were raised at that meeting, Mr. Causey, the chief accounting officer, gave a rousing defense, saying every transaction was vetted by him and by Arthur Andersen, Enron's outside accountants.
 Along with Mr. Fastow, Mr. Glisan has also pleaded guilty to felonies. Mr. Causey has been indicted on multiple counts of fraud.
 Meanwhile, Mr. Lay said, reports from his biggest operating divisions were uniformly positive.

Personal Stock Sales
 Other information gave him reason to believe Enron's stock price would recover, Mr. Lay said. For example, in mid-September, Goldman, Sachs informed him that Enron was at risk of a hostile takeover because its stock price had fallen below its true value. Board records show that in the second week of October, Goldman made a full presentation on the dangers from the low stock price, and presented defenses Enron should have at the ready to ward off unwanted suitors.
 Mr. Lay maintains his heavy stock sales throughout 2001 were not an effort to bail out of Enron; rather, he says, he was making every effort to hold on to every share he could.
 For more than a decade, Mr. Lay kept almost all of his holdings in Enron stock. Before 2001, his financial advisers persuaded him to diversify. But he refused to sell his shares to raise the cash for other investments. So instead, he borrowed about $100 million, using a large chunk of his Enron stock as collateral. Most of that money went into hard-to-sell assets, like investment properties and private equity deals.
 ''I wanted to hold on to the Enron stock,'' he said, ''So I used the Enron stock as collateral to borrow the money and then reinvest.''
 Such a strategy would only work, of course, if Enron stock held steady or rose. But Mr. Lay said he did not think the price would fall. ''That was not something I thought very hard about in 2000,'' he said. 
 Once the stock price did start falling, however, Mr. Lay received demands for more cash from the banks. He had few assets he could readily sell to meet those demands, and many of those were disposed of in the face of the financial pressure. 
 In consultation with his financial advisers, Mr. Lay said, he decided to increase his gamble on Enron stock. After alerting the company to his plans, he borrowed money from a corporate line of credit, to the limit of $4 million -- and later more than $7 million -- and used that to meet his margin calls. Then, he waited, hoping for the price to go up. If another margin call arrived, he repaid the corporate line with Enron shares, and borrowed again to meet the new obligation from the banks.
 Under the bank contracts, Mr. Lay could not refuse payment. If he failed to meet his margin loans, the banks would sell his shares for him, and had the right to dispose of as much they wanted. 
 ''Knowing bankers, I thought if they did that, they would make sure they met the margin call, and maybe sell a little more to build up a cushion,'' he said. ''From my standpoint, I was trying to sell as few shares as I could.''
 There are independent signs that is true. That summer, Mr. Lay converted more than 200,000 options into stock, but did not sell the shares, incurring a tax liability on an investment that proved worthless. More telling, in late September, he received a cash bonus of $10 million for rejoining the company, and used all of it to pay down his bank debt -- using cash to forestall the further forced sale of Enron shares.
 Through August and September of that year, Mr. Lay was forced by margin calls to sell more than 550,000 Enron shares. At the same time, he was awarded or purchased almost 185,000 shares. This has become an area of investigation by prosecutors because, during a September 26 online meeting with employees, Mr. Lay responded to a question by commenting that he had purchased shares. But in the aggregate, he was a net seller.
 Securities law experts said that because of the difference between forced sales and voluntary purchases, it was difficult to call Mr. Lay's statements a fraud. 
 ''You aren't able to aggregate all of the transactions over the prior month, particularly when those are explained by economic necessity rather than volitional decision,'' said John C. Coffee Jr., a professor with Columbia Law School. ''I am dubious that you can call that a fraud.'' 
 But still, in the interview, Mr. Lay was asked whether he believed he owed employees a fuller response, and an explanation that he was selling shares, forced or not.
 ''Let me put it this way, it just didn't cross my mind,'' he said. ''I was doing my best to hang on to as much as I could because I was convinced that the fundamentals of the company were so strong.''
 Despite the rumblings that criminal charges against him could well be imminent, Mr. Lay says he is sanguine.
 ''I know in my mind I did nothing wrong and nothing criminal,'' he said. ''But I'd say if it does happen, it's a great miscarriage of justice.''
 But, if faced with indictment, would Mr. Lay consider pleading guilty?
 ''Absolutely not.''

HEADLINE: New York Wants Its Money Back, or at Least Some of It

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY

DATELINE: Washington 

 BODY:
POLITICAL donors were ready to pay handsomely for a lunch at Michael Bloomberg's house in honor of two Republican congressmen, but then one of them, Bob Ney of Ohio, voted against a bill that would have given New York a bigger share of money from a federal antiterrorism program. The mayor promptly disinvited him, and the fund-raising lunch was canceled.
 There are two ways to view this dispute. To the rest of America, it probably looks like another example of an arrogant New York plutocrat throwing his wallet around. But to New Yorkers, it's more like seeing Oliver Wendell Douglas, the Park Avenue lawyer played by Eddie Albert on ''Green Acres,'' finally banish Mr. Haney from his dinner table. 
 It's not that Mr. Ney resembles Mr. Haney, the aw-shucks merchant in Hooterville who unloads his decrepit farm on the New Yorkers and then keeps finding new ways to fleece them. But Mr. Ney is part of an institution that routinely takes money from New Yorkers and sends it to the sticks. New Yorkers pay more than their share of taxes, thanks to high salaries, but taxation doesn't buy them even their share of representation in Washington. Their money counts only when politicians come to town begging for it. 
 During a typical year, New York State sends Washington about $15 billion more in taxes than it gets back in federal spending, according to a series of reports over three decades by the late Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan and researchers at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. 
 New York politicians have vowed to fight for their fair share, along with other big losers like New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Illinois and California. Before becoming senator, Hillary Rodham Clinton promised to ''create a coalition of the big states to stand up for our interests,'' but once in Washington she found the usual problem: a coalition of small states with more votes, especially in the Senate, and more clout, now that most of New York's legislators are in the minority party.
 But as Mr. Bloomberg realizes, New York still has more of one political commodity that matters to the Republican majority: millionaires with checkbooks.
 ''New York is second only to California as the biggest treasure trove for Republicans in the nation,'' said Rick Davis, a Republican strategist who managed the 2000 presidential campaign of Senator John McCain. ''Since it doesn't have a natural base of power in Washington, it makes sense for the mayor to use New York's one natural resource -- cash. You hope it will make the Republicans in Congress more sensitive to a city that they would normally disdain.''
 Mario Cuomo, who fought to bring back some of New York's money as a congressman and governor, approved of the mayor's action. ''We shouldn't be insolent or ungracious, but we should say, 'Look, I'm disappointed you didn't respond to our call for help, so I feel uncomfortable welcoming you,''' he said. ''We're not asking for equity in getting back all the billions we've sent to Washington. But after Sept. 11, we have special needs, and we'd like a little more than we usually get.''
 Some conservatives, though, argue that New York's politicians should be grateful to Republicans, even if Congress did stiff the city on the recent antiterrorism bill. The $446 million the bill would have shifted from a nationwide fund to New York and other high-risk cities is small change compared with the money New Yorkers received from the Bush tax cuts. Because of the high cost of living and correspondingly high salaries, even middle-class New Yorkers are in relatively high tax brackets, so they have benefited more than the rest of America from the cuts.
 E. J. McMahon, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, estimates that the income tax cuts gave $12 billion to the state's residents last year, and that's not counting the additional boost Wall Street got from the cuts in taxes on dividends and capital gains. So why, he asks, did so much of the state's delegation in Congress oppose tax cuts?
 ''Imagine if President Bush had decided the key to economic recovery was encouraging Americans to buy new cars, and then tell me how the Michigan Congressional delegation would have reacted,'' Mr. McMahon said. ''The irony is that all these fire-breathing supply-siders in the House, the guys that New Yorkers love to hate, are the ones who actually advocate the kind of tax policies that really help the city, while our delegation keeps begging the rest of the country to take more of our money.''
 You could also ask why those legislators from the heartland who voted for tax cuts were so determined to give back New Yorkers' money that would otherwise have been redistributed to their states. Because they, like New York's politicians, are listening to their constituents. New York Democrats vote for big government even if they get stuck with the bill, and Republicans in red states vote for small government even if it means giving up the city slickers' money.
 Of course, few voters actually know how much money their states are getting back from Washington, and maybe they would be more mercenary if they could feel the effects first hand -- the way that some Republican politicians looking for campaign funds are now feeling the loss of lunch with Mr. Bloomberg.
 So perhaps they'll vote differently the next time New York asks them to throw a few hundred million dollars its way. As Mr. Haney realized, sometimes it pays to pretend the slickers are coming out ahead.

HEADLINE: It Depends What the Meaning of 'Liberal' Is

BYLINE: By JOHN MICKLETHWAIT and ADRIAN WOOLDRIDGE. 
John Micklethwait and Adrian Wooldridge, who write for The Economist, are the authors of ''The Right Nation: Conservative Power in America.''

 BODY:
LAST week, America witnessed one of the great acts of political fealty. Across the country, liberal Americans lined up to buy copies of ''My Life'' by Bill Clinton. Like his wife's autobiography, ''Living History,'' Mr. Clinton's book has become a sort of literary bumper sticker -- a label of loyalty to the liberal cause, to go on the coffee table alongside those tickets for Michael Moore's ''Fahrenheit 9/11.''
 Mr. Clinton certainly qualifies as a liberal icon in two ways: as the first Democratic president to win re-election since Franklin Roosevelt and as a hated figure for the right -- the noninhaling, draft-dodging slick Willie. Yet in most other respects, Mr. Clinton's record belies the liberal tag. He was a fiscal conservative who balanced the books, reined in spending, promoted free trade, oversaw a Wall Street boom, signed a welfare overhaul and supported tough crime policies that many old-style liberals once regarded as barbaric. 
 At one point, Mr. Clinton famously complained that he had become an Eisenhower Republican. But even that term may be too liberal. Dwight D. Eisenhower argued that a ''gently expanding'' government was part of a civilized society. Mr. Clinton declared ''the end of big government.'' 
 He was never a rigidly ideological figure. Rather he was a malleable pragmatist who wanted the Democratic Party to adjust to a country whose center of gravity was moving to the right. He grew up speaking the language of conservative America. His life-long affair with Christianity began when he was 8. In his autobiography, he confesses that when he watched the riots at the 1968 Democratic National Convention, he understood how both sides felt, the protesters and the police.
 He cut his political teeth fighting a rearguard action against the spread of Republicanism across the South. In one of his first campaigns, working for George McGovern in Texas, he watched the state of Lyndon B. Johnson vote overwhelmingly for Nixon. In 1980, he lost the governorship of Arkansas after his first term because he was regarded as too much a liberal, and he shifted sharply right thereafter. He approved the first executions in his home state since 1964. He so courted business that the A.F.L.-C.I.O. refused to endorse his re-election. And his educational policies had such a conservative bent that William J. Bennett, President Reagan's education secretary, inscribed a book in 1987 to ''the Democrat who makes sense.''
 Mr. Clinton came to national attention as the leader of the Democratic Leadership Council, a group that promoted globalization, a muscular foreign policy and a tough stance on social policies; it was widely derided by liberals as Democrats for the Leisure Class. In the 1992 presidential campaign Mr. Clinton attacked the anti-white language of the rapper Sister Souljah, promised a middle class tax cut and returned to Arkansas to preside over the execution of a mentally retarded black man. 
 What about his record once in the White House? Liberals advance two arguments as to why he was really one of them. The first, which is also a canon of the president's persecutors on the right, is that he tried to be liberal in his first two years in office -- by standing up for gays in the military and promoting a health care plan. This march to the left was stopped, according to the liberal version, only under heavy right-wing assault.
 But was the new president really so liberal? The gays-in-the-military controversy is uncharacteristic. Just days after the election, the president-elect was asked whether he would fulfill a campaign promise to let gays serve openly in the military; one of the best wafflers in American politics flatly said, ''Yes, I want to.'' When a political firestorm blew up, he compromised with a ''don't ask, don't tell'' policy.
 Rather than being an attempt to nationalize a seventh of the economy, as conservatives claimed, his health care plan had the backing of many large manufacturers and insurers who wanted to curb health costs. In the same first two years, Mr. Clinton also embraced the fiscal conservatism of Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin and championed the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
 Another argument advanced to bestow liberal credentials on Mr. Clinton is that he forged a progressive presidency by stealth. Lots of little things -- the earned-income tax credit, some environmental measures, general support for multiculturalism -- added up to one big thing: the third way.
 Yet the policy of triangulation, which Mr. Clinton followed after 1994, tried to put distance between the president and both the Republicans and the Democrats. Bite-sized conservative policies balanced the bite-sized liberal ones: his support for school uniforms and tough sentencing laws, for example. He not only proposed the Defense of Marriage Act but then his re-election campaign bought 70 spots on Christian radio stations to brag about it. 
 Richard Nixon, many say, talked like a conservative but governed like a liberal. He liked to quote Disraeli that ''a sound conservative government'' consists of ''Tory men and Whig measures.'' In many ways Mr. Clinton was the opposite, argued a few conservatives, including David Frum, a former speechwriter for President Bush. ''Clinton makes speeches,'' Mr. Frum wrote in The Weekly Standard in 1999. ''Rubin and Greenspan make policy; the Left gets words, the Right gets deeds; and everybody is content.'' 
 Indeed, some small-government advocates, who have criticized federal spending increases under President Bush, look back on Mr. Clinton with some warmth. ''I had my problems with the guy when he was in office,'' said Brink Lindsey, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, ''but I've pinched myself recently when I've found that I've been suffering from Clinton nostalgia. Their policy on trade liberalization, spending control and welfare reform looks pretty good.''
 So why the lines in the bookstores in Manhattan, Berkeley and other liberal bastions? The easy answer is that the impeachment battle reunited the Democratic base. When liberals buy ''My Life,'' they see it as blow against Kenneth W. Starr, the Republican impeachment squad and even President Bush. 
 Mr. Clinton spends a good deal of ''My Life'' complaining about conservative America undermining him. In fact, his enemies have helped solidify his liberal base.

HEADLINE: As Safety Standards Rise, So Will the Air Bag Count

BYLINE: By JIM McCRAW

 BODY:
AT the 1995 Detroit auto show, Mercedes-Benz rolled out a safety research vehicle equipped with 17 air bags, an elaborate demonstration of how cars of the future might protect passengers from highway mishaps of almost any description. 
 At the time, show visitors were taken aback by the seemingly implausible number of safety devices built into the X-bag, as Mercedes called its overachiever of a luxury sedan. But what appeared excessive a decade ago is not nearly so far-fetched today; vehicles with eight air bags are available now in showrooms, and the quantity is likely to increase.
 Among the factors driving this trend are increasingly stringent safety regulations, especially those involving side-impact collisions. Last month, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration proposed new test procedures and regulations that would, for the first time, set standards for head protection in side crashes. 
 Though the government does not stipulate the technology or type of devices automakers must use to meet standards, safety engineers generally agree that the new rules would effectively mandate the installation of side-impact air bags. Since automakers already have a voluntary commitment to make head protection air bags standard in most vehicles by the end of the decade, the proposals are considered likely to proceed through the approval process next year, though some details of the test procedures may be modified. 
 Shielding passengers from injury in a side impact is a more vexing problem than protecting them in a frontal collision. In a head-on impact, the fenders, hood and suspension all fold up, helping to disperse the forces; the flanks of a vehicle offer far less vehicle structure -- only the thickness of a door -- to absorb the energy of a crash. 
 ''Side impacts, compared to frontal impacts, are much more challenging,'' said Sean Ryan, a supervisor of safety systems at Ford Motor Company. Additionally, Mr. Ryan explained, the limited crush space reduces the time in which the system can react to an impact and inflate the air bag.
 Several configurations of side-impact air bags are being used by automakers. Some, like the thorax bags designed primarily to protect the upper body, are tucked behind the door panels. Others are mounted inside the seat backrests; these designs may also provide coverage of the pelvis at the lower end or have extended cushions at the top to shield the head. 
 Other designs are specifically intended to provide head protection. One is a long cylindrical tube that inflates across the side window area to prevent head contact with solid parts of the car's interior. Another overhead design, the curtain air bag, inflates downward from the ceiling trim and covers the side windows entirely. According to the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, more than half of model year 2004 cars and trucks are available with head protection air bags. 
 The side curtain air bag is regarded by many engineers to be the design best suited to meeting future safety standards, in part because its slim design helps reduce inflation time. 
 ''It's a relatively small-volume bag, so the time it takes to fill and provide effective restraint is much quicker,'' said Patrick Jarboe, a senior engineer at Autoliv, a large producer of auto safety systems. ''We can deploy a side curtain air bag in 10 milliseconds and fill it in about 10 more milliseconds,'' Mr. Jarboe said.
 Still, no single air bag design can cover all the bases. ''Generally, a vehicle with a side curtain air bag would provide good protection against head injury,'' said Doug Campbell, the vice president for occupant safety systems engineering at TRW, a major supplier of air bags. ''But the curtain air bag is not large enough for the entire upper body, so you may also need thorax bag or a thorax and pelvic bag,'' Mr. Campbell said. A large S.U.V. that is high off the ground may only need a side curtain air bag, he said.
 The proposed changes to the regulations, which affect Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 214, would also require modifications to the crash test dummies currently in use. A new female crash test dummy called for in the proposal represents a 4-foot-11-inch woman. Use of this dummy, along with a more advanced male dummy, will help automakers develop better side-impact safety systems for a broader percentage of the population, according to the safety administration.
 The new rules would also require an additional test involving an angled 20-mile-an-hour side impact into a 10-inch diameter pole, since a large number of deaths occur when a single vehicle strikes a tree or a utility pole. The Federal Highway Administration estimates there are 80 million utility poles lining American roads, 50 feet or less from the road. 
 The safety administration estimates that the rules changes would save 700 to 1,000 lives a year. The proposed changes could be finalized as early as 2005, with a phase-in period for 50 percent of all new light vehicles (under 10,000 pounds gross vehicle weight) sold beginning in 2007, and required for all 2009 model year cars, trucks and S.U.V.'s.
 The agency estimates that the new rules will add $208 to the cost of a vehicle (in 2002 dollars), an additional cost of $1.6 to $3.6 billion annually.
 ''We think the benefits are huge,'' said Brian O'Neill, the president of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, speaking about the new tests. ''Our research suggests that side head air bags can reduce the risk of a fatal injury in a side impact crash by about 45 percent,'' Mr. O'Neill said.

HEADLINE: The Price of War

BYLINE: By GORDON ADAMS AND NIGEL HOLMES. 
Gordon Adams, a senior defense budget official for the White House from 1993 to 1997, is a professor of international affairs at George Washington University. Nigel Holmes is a graphic designer.

 BODY:
The transfer of governmental authority to the Iraqis this week will inevitably lower the profile of the costs of war and reconstruction. But the commitment of the United States remains substantial. 
American taxpayers have already spent over $100 billion in support of military operations in Iraq, and Congress is likely to approve $25 billion more this summer. In addition, more than $21 billion is pledged for postwar reconstruction. 
 This chart shows the expenses already incurred and the potential sources of funds to rebuild and stabilize Iraq. In the end, President Bush's former senior economic adviser, Lawrence B. Lindsey, was right when he said in September 2002 that the Iraq war could cost $100 billion to $200 billion.
 Security will continue to be the biggest job for the Iraqis and for the United States, requiring a sustained American military presence and quick and efficient training for Iraqi security services. There are other challenges. Iraq's infrastructure is still in shambles, and the Iraqi government will need funds to pay its civilian and uniformed personnel and cover its operations. Iraq also will have to begin paying back some of its sizable debt, although some portion may be forgiven. None of this will succeed if the government can't make the country safe. Recovery will prove impossible and insurgents in Iraq will seek to make this so.
 If the new government and its administrators cannot surmount these obstacles, a significant part of the assistance will be wasted and the credibility of the new regime could fade. The challenge, and the cost of meeting that challenge, remain high.

HEADLINE: Families, Deep in Debt, Bracing For Pain of Interest Rate Rise

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

DATELINE: LANCASTER, Pa., June 25 

 BODY:
With the Federal Reserve about to raise interest rates for the first time in four years, Joyce Diffenderfer is beginning to wonder how she and her husband, Curtis, will deflect the growing cost of their $16,000 in credit card debt. 
 Not that her concern is a pressing issue yet; it is more like a fire drill in anticipation of a fire that she is still not convinced will occur. The Diffenderfers figure that a modest rate increase would initially add only $35 to their monthly card payments, which now total more than $600. Still, they have run out of ways to sidestep the cost of borrowing, and if the rates keep rising, as the Fed's leaders suggest they will, then the only alternative, Mrs. Diffenderfer said, will be to seriously cut family spending.
 The Diffenderfers are among the millions of American families who rode the recent wave of low interest rates to home ownership and the rapid accumulation of debt, and now they must cope as rates begin to swing upward. The process is almost certain to begin at a meeting of the Fed's policy makers on Tuesday and Wednesday. They are widely expected to raise rates a quarter of a percentage point and follow that with similar increases periodically over the next 18 months. 
 ''Unless there is a sizable jump in rates, let's say two percentage points within a year, I'm not going to think much about it,'' said Mrs. Diffenderfer, 47, who earns $14 an hour fielding customer calls at Kunzler & Company, a manufacturer of sausages and frankfurters in this southern Pennsylvania industrial city on the fringe of Amish country. 
 ''Less than two percentage points we can handle just by not eating out as much,'' she said, swiveling her chair away from her computer for an interview late in the day, after the phone calls died down. Her husband, 55, is a construction worker.
 By several measures, Americans are more indebted than ever. Through the first quarter, they owed nearly $9 trillion in home mortgages, car loans, credit card debt, home equity loans and other forms of personal borrowing -- accumulating nearly 40 percent of this total in just four years, according to published Federal Reserve data. But most of the debt is at fixed interest rates. Thus it will be unaffected initially as the central bank begins its much expected quarter-point increases in the so-called federal funds rate, now at a 46-year low of 1 percent. The federal funds rate, in turn, influences the interest rate cost of most household and commercial debt. 
 Only one-fifth of the $9 trillion in total household debt, or $1.8 trillion, is borrowed at variable rates. Variable rates, like those that the Diffenderfers pay on their four credit cards, often track what the Fed does, which means they are likely to rise one-quarter of a percentage point over the next few weeks. The immediate cost for the nation's households as a result of this process could be as much as $4.5 billion, including the initial $35 increase in the Diffenderfers' monthly credit card bill.
 The $4.5 billion is roughly 10 percent of the cost of the rise in oil prices so far this year. That is not a big number yet, but each quarter-point increase would be another step closer to matching the oil shock, which brought gasoline prices above $2 a gallon in many parts of the country. 
 While the oil shock quickly raised the gasoline and heating oil bills of nearly every household, the burden of higher interest payments falls most heavily in the early stages on lower- and middle-income families. They are the biggest users of variable rate debt, particularly on credit cards, various studies show.
 Upper income families, on the other hand -- that is, families with more than $80,000 in annual income -- are more likely to have fixed rate debt, particularly mortgages, and to owe relatively little on their credit cards. What variable rate debt they do have is usually at lower interest rates than lower income people. Lower income people, as a result, are 10 times more likely than upper income people to be devoting 40 percent or more of their income to debt repayment, the Economic Policy Institute reports. In addition, upper income people are the nation's biggest savers, and a rate increase raises the return on their interest-bearing securities.
 ''If you are a household with a lot of variable-rate debt and little equity left in your home that you have not already borrowed against, this is going to be a scary time,'' said Mark Zandi, who is the chief economist at Economy.com.
 The Diffenderfers have a combined income of nearly $70,000 a year, including the overtime he earns and the small payments she receives as assistant organist at her church. They have been married 17 years but they lived with her mother for the first 11, paying her rent. When they finally bought a house of their own in 1998, for $89,000, they had nothing saved for a down payment, and borrowed the entire amount through a 30-year mortgage. They also took out a second mortgage, for $30,000, which they invested in remodeling the home: aluminum siding, a new bathroom and a refinished living room with oak trimmed walls.
 As interest rates fell, they refinanced both mortgages, locking in a 5.25 percent fixed interest rate for 30 years. Still, the remodeling continued, mainly on credit cards once the $30,000 was exhausted. Their three-bedroom house is now worth nearly $120,000, almost equal to the mortgage debt, Mrs. Diffenderfer estimates. That leaves the couple with no spare equity that can be extracted in cash through a bigger mortgage. Nor can they lower their $726-a-month mortgage payment. With mortgage rates already rising in anticipation of the Fed's increases, that once lucrative route for millions of consumers is closing. 
 The Diffenderfers have only their salaries to meet the rising cost of their variable rate credit card debt, although for a while Mrs. Diffenderfer managed to reduce the interest payments by switching the balances to new credit cards whenever she could get a lower rate. The interest rates on her cards now average just under 10 percent, partly through her efforts to find teaser discounts and partly because credit card companies dropped their rates several percentage points, a decline now likely to be reversed. 
 ''There are adjustments we could make in our spending,'' Mrs. Diffenderfer said. ''Eating out is one. We could put remodeling of our home on hold and give ourselves a breather. We contribute $125 a week to our church. We don't want to cut back on that but we would if our financial situation changed drastically. It would have to be pretty drastic.''
 Another notch up in home prices would give the Diffenderfers some relief; they could float a 4 to 5 percent home equity loan against the additional value of their home and use the loan to pay down credit card debt. Tens of millions of Americans have used this route to lower the interest cost of credit card debt. With homes appreciating more slowly, there is less collateral left to support home equity loans, and paying the outstanding balances will become more costly. They totaled $375 billion at the end of last year.Home prices are a big potential casualty of rising interest rates. Sales of new and existing homes surged in May, the government reported, as people apparently rushed to become homeowners before mortgage rates went any higher. The average 30-year mortgage is already up a percentage point since early spring.
 But for Stephen Black, a homebuilder here, the surge in home sales is a false signal. The customer base is already shrinking for his basic product, a two-story house with four bedrooms and a two-car garage on nearly a quarter-acre, a home currently priced at $215,000. 
 The buyers were families with $50,000 to $70,000 in annual income. Now they are increasingly bunched at the high end. The low end is pulling back partly because mortgages are more costly, Mr. Smith says, but also because in the past year the cost of building materials rose $17,000 and his company, Stephen Black Builders, has been able to pass along only $14,000 of that. Even the higher-income families have resisted paying the last $3,000. ''Sales of these homes had been averaging 20 to 22 a year,'' Mr. Smith said, ''but I think they will drop to 18 to 20.''
 One antidote to rising interest rates could be the recent surge in employment, and all the new income that will accompany the one million jobs created since February -- but that remains to be seen. ''The question really is, are the people who are leveraged with debt, are they the ones getting the jobs and income?'' said Richard Berner, chief domestic economist at Morgan Stanley. Employment growth has been fairly robust in Lancaster, but even so, Mr. Smith is seeing fewer customers as they react to rising prices and interest rates.
 Across town, in a rundown neighborhood, the working poor are just starting to show up in greater numbers at Tabor Community Services, a Lancaster agency that counsels those deeply in debt, said Michael Weaver, president of Tabor.
 The ''fragile low income,'' as Mr. Weaver calls them, do not tend to own homes, but those who do buy them through subprime mortgage loans, in many cases with adjustable rates. Apart from housing, nearly every transaction for these consumers involves interest payments in one form or another. Lacking enough income, they rent television sets, furniture and appliances, signing agreements that can adjust upward as interest rates rise.
 Like their higher income peers, Mr. Weaver's clients often take loans to buy car, in their case, used cars. But they are loans of shorter duration and higher interest rates than the standard four- or five-year new car loan, now averaging 7.4 percent. They have credit cards, but at rates above 15 percent, which convert into much higher penalties when monthly payments are late.
 ''These are people who are maxed out on debt,'' Mr. Weaver said, ''and their numbers are growing.''

HEADLINE: The Outlook for a New Era of No Longer Cheap Money

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT

 BODY:
When the leaders of the Federal Reserve gather this week around the massive mahogany table at their headquarters in Washington, they may want to pause for a moment of silence. By the time their two-day meeting ends on Wednesday, they are all but certain to have laid to rest an economic era that has lasted almost 25 years.
 Through three recessions, two long booms and one of the biggest bubbles in stock market history, interest rates have generally been falling since 1980. Their great decline -- to a short-term rate of 1 percent today, down from 20 percent at the peak -- has helped change the economy's rules, making credit cards the centerpiece of American wallets and allowing millions of families to buy their first houses. 
 Now, those rules are about to change again. The Fed is poised to raise its benchmark rate by a quarter-point -- to 1.25 percent, up from a 46-year low -- and to continue the increases for months on end. Economists say that another half-century could pass before rates again fall to their levels now. 
 Rates are likely to remain low, compared with almost any period except the last few years. But the simple fact that they will be increasing, perhaps for years, creates a new economic dynamic. 
 What may be most worrisome, economists say, is that rising rates often expose problems that were papered over by the benefits of ever-cheaper credit.
 ''It's a challenging period to make the transition to withholding the economic stimulus at just the right time,'' Lawrence H. Meyer, a former Fed governor, said. ''But it's a challenge of success,'' he said, alluding to the Fed's battle to bring the economy out of the recent downturn, ''and it's better to manage success than to manage failure.''
 With higher rates giving investors a newfound ability to make a decent return on safe investments, many might suddenly flee riskier ones. That happened during the modest rate increases of the mid-1990's, helping to cause the Mexican peso crisis and the bankruptcy of Orange County, Calif. This time, hedge funds -- larger than they were a decade ago, and with a tendency not to make their investments public -- offer a particular source of uncertainty.
 Rising rates will also reduce the additional cash many households have been able to get by refinancing their mortgages. The biggest question, though, may be whether the millions of families with adjustable rate mortgages will still be able to meet their monthly payments without making big cuts in the rest of the budget.
 Fed officials' recent efforts to communicate their policies publicly -- in this case, their plan to raise rates slowly and steadily -- could minimize turmoil, by giving businesses, consumers and investors time to react that they did not have a decade ago.
 Still, said Ethan Harris, chief United States economist at Lehman Brothers, ''I think we're going to have some accidents along the way. It's inevitable.''
 These new concerns reflect the reversing fortunes of many of the economy's biggest pieces. What was up is now headed down, in large part, and what was down is moving up. 
 The worst hiring slump in two decades has given way to help-wanted signs and healthy job gains this year. The decline in the dollar against many other currencies has helped exports jump in the last year. Business executives finally have the confidence to buy new machines and software again. Many retirees who rely on investments for their income are getting a welcome, if modest, raise.
 But federal, state and local government spending on everything other than the military, an important crutch during a downturn, is falling. Rising interest rates will probably cause home sales, long soaring, to decline eventually and house prices to stop increasing rapidly. Prices might fall in some large metropolitan areas on the East and West Coasts, economists say.
 One measure of inflation, having been subdued for years, accelerated to an annual pace of 2.9 percent in the first three months of 2004, from 1.5 percent at the end of last year, the Commerce Department said Friday. Americans expect prices to increase about 3.4 percent over the next year, the highest level in a decade, according to monthly polls conducted by the University of Michigan.
 ''It used to be that everyone complained about employment and thought low prices and interest rates were the bright spots in the economy,'' said Richard T. Curtin, director of consumer surveys at Michigan. ''Now they've switched.''
 Investors expect the Fed's benchmark rate to rise to 2.25 percent by December, based on the price of a futures contract linked to monetary policy. Fed officials have said that they plan to increase rates gradually, and most analysts assume that means a quarter-point at a time.
 Conventional 30-year mortgage rates -- which like other long-term rates are set by the market partly in response to Fed policy -- have already risen to about 6.3 percent, from 5.4 percent late in March, according to Haver Analytics. 
 ''Unlike 1994, there has been an appreciable increase of market rates in anticipation of policy tightening,'' Mr. Greenspan said recently, ''though history cautions that investors' anticipations of the cumulative magnitude of policy actions and their timing under such circumstances are far from perfect.''
 History also cautions that the Fed is rarely able to restrict itself to only quarter-point rate changes. The economy has usually moved more quickly, up or down, than policy makers initially expect. 
 ''Prudence gives way to impassioned action,'' said Robert J. Barbera, chief economist of ITG/Hoenig, an investment firm. ''I'd be very surprised if we get to a 4 percent fund rate with a series of step-wise 25 basis points.'' (In the language of investors and Fed officials, 25 basis points are equivalent to one-quarter of a percentage point.)
 Early in 1994, as the economy gained strength, the Fed raised rates by a quarter-point three times. But the next four increases were all at least a half-point, bringing the benchmark short-term rate to 6 percent by early 1995. That was one of the few periods of rising rates since 1980, and none lasted long enough to undo the overall decline during that period.
 The mid-90's increases caught many investors by surprise, leading to a drop in stock prices and the stampede out of some risky investments. Almost no one will be taken by surprise this time by a long campaign of rate increases -- another reason to be optimistic about the economy. 
 But expecting a major economic change is not enough to allow people to know what it will bring. The new era of rising rates, with its uncertain implications, begins in two days.

HEADLINE: Paddling in the Doldrums

BYLINE: By WENDY KNIGHT

 BODY:
On a preflight inspection in January, the professional paddler Brad Ludden circled his Piper Cherokee 180. Relaxed from a morning run down Vail Mountain, he eased his 5-foot-11, 180-pound frame into the cockpit, his grandfather's World War II wings watching over him from the dash, and radioed the tower for departure.
 In the world of professional white-water kayaking -- where most paddlers barely have enough gas money to get to the next competition -- the 23-year-old Ludden is an anomaly. He makes more than $100,000 a year from sponsorships and speaking engagements, at least five times more than the average pro paddler, which enabled him to buy the $27,000 twin-engine plane. 
 Beyond the indeterminate number of first descents of rivers -- ''It's not something I keep track of,'' he says -- Ludden has accrued a fistful of other milestones: the first paddler sponsored by Nike, the first with an agent and the first to be featured in a Warren Miller film, a genre known for its images of extreme skiing. 
 But another accomplishment is the one that perhaps best defines Ludden. Four years ago, he founded First Descents, a kayak camp for adolescents with cancer. ''Kayaking has been an avenue to see the world,'' said Ludden, a former junior world champion who has traveled to more than 40 countries. ''The camp is my way to give back to a sport that has given me so much.'' 
 Ludden's efforts have not gone unnoticed. ''Few paddlers exhibit a selfless dedication to helping disadvantaged people enjoy the sport like he does,'' said Eugene Buchanan, editor in chief of Paddler Magazine.
 White-water kayaking is one of the fastest-growing recreational sports in the United States. In 2002, 3.9 million Americans age 16 or older participated in the sport, up from 1.8 million in 2001, a 33 percent increase, according to the Outdoor Industry Association. Of those participants, 435,000 were deemed enthusiasts (people who paddled five times or more a year).
 Much like Ludden, the typical white-water paddler is an unmarried, childless white male, age 16 to 24. For this demographic, the attraction to white-water kayaking has been fueled by freestyle competitions, called rodeos, that feature a crush of swirling water caused by a reversal of the water's current. In these play holes, which could engulf a Greyhound bus, competitors maneuver their boats into various tricks that are given points based on their degree of difficulty. For example, spinning the boat 360 degrees, an easy move, earns 1 point.
 Although recreational kayaking is booming, the competitive circuit has slipped into an organizational and sponsorship tailspin. In 1998, when the freestyle circuit was robust, Ludden competed in each of the 40-plus competitions. This year, there are 26 events, most of them regional. And the athletes have resorted to judging the competitions themselves. 
 The prize money has never been substantial. A top contender in most rodeos might make only $500 to $2,000 in an event. In 1998 -- his best year -- Eric Jackson, the Olympian and the current International Freestyle champion, made $16,000 from competitions, a paltry sum relative to other professional sports. The Teva Mountain Games, held every June in Vail, Colo., where Ludden lives, are the signature white-water event. This year it attracted more than 200 professional and amateur competitors who vied for a purse of $13,350. 
 The collapse of an organized pro circuit and a souring economy have also forced manufacturers to scale back on sponsorship, the primary source of income for professional kayakers. Last year, Liquidlogic, a manufacturer in Flat Rock, N.C., reduced its team of paddlers to 5 from 20 the previous year, according to Steve Jordan, vice president of sales. 
 ''The pros just cater to each other,'' Jordan said. ''They're not meeting intermediate and beginner paddlers, anyway.''
 Ludden and Ben Selznick, a friend and fellow pro, are currently renegotiating with Nike, which, according to Selznick, wants to slice their contracts in half. ''Right now, they want to sponsor adventure racers,'' Selznick said. ''They're only interested in what's hot.''
 What makes a sport hot is its ability to attract a television audience. ''TV drives everything in the world of sports,'' said Rob Mitchell, a former United States brand director for Nike and now a senior executive with Smartwool, a clothing manufacturer. ''Kayaking is not a spectator sport. If it doesn't sell a ticket, it's not going to be a viable sport.'' 
 As with yacht racing, freestyle kayaking is hampered by the lack of visual aids like big screens or scoreboards that transmit the sport to the masses. ''Except to the distinguished eye, all the moves look the same,'' said Buchanan, the magazine editor, who is an avid paddler. Additionally, remote river canyons, where white-water conditions exist, are challenging places for all but the most intrepid film crews. 
 It is not all bad news for professional paddlers, however. Companies like Scott Lindgren Productions and Teton Gravity Research are combining paddling and cinematography skills to produce adventure kayak videos that give the pros an outlet to appease sponsors and broadcast the sport. 
 ''Filming pushes the sport into other places,'' Ludden said. ''It allows us to see outside our world, outside ourselves.''

Bertrand Russell Seidman, who was at the forefront of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s efforts to improve Social Security and pension benefits, died on Thursday at his home in Falls Church, Va., the A.F.L.-C.I.O. announced. He was 84.
 For decades, Mr. Seidman worked closely with George Meany, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s president, serving as its representative in Europe, as an economist for the federation and later as an adviser on pensions, health care and Social Security. 
 Bertrand Russell Seidman was born on Sept. 22, 1919, in Brooklyn. After he graduated from Townsend Harris High School in 1934, he attended City College. He transferred to the University of Wisconsin, earning a bachelor's degree in economics in 1938 and a master's degree in economics in 1941. 
 Mr. Seidman, a pacifist and socialist, was a conscientious objector during World War II and as alternative service he helped build the Blue Ridge Parkway.
 After the war, he became assistant executive secretary of the Workers Defense League. There, he met Annabel Henry, whom he married in 1948. She died last year. 
 In 1948 he joined the A.F.L.'s staff, working as an economist in its research department until 1962.
 From that year until 1966, he was the federation's European representative. 
 From 1958 to 1976 he was a member of the American delegation to the International Labor Organization.
 From 1966 to 1990, when he retired from the A.F.L.-C.I.O., he headed the federation's Social Security department.
 In retirement he was a founder of Save Our Security, one of the earliest groups to oppose privatizing Social Security.
 He is survived by three daughters, Margaret Seidman of Fairfax, Va., Joan Seidman Welsh of Arlington, Va., and Elizabeth Seidman Garaufis of Queens, N.Y.; two brothers, Lloyd G. Seidman and Benedict S. Seidman, both of New York; five grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.

HEADLINE: The Blacks Who Get Into Harvard

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 As an African-American and a recent Harvard graduate, I have found that my day-to-day life -- loan payments and choosing a job over a non-paying internship -- is shaped more by my socioeconomic profile (lower middle class) than by my racial one.
 A rise in the number of students who represent the economically disadvantaged would automatically result in more slave-descendant African-Americans on campuses, while not ignoring those from other races and cultures who would profit from a prestigious college degree just as much.

HEADLINE: Advice for Investors: Don't Panic Over Rates

BYLINE: By ALEX BERENSON

 BODY:
Stay the course. With the Federal Reserve all but certain to raise short-term interest rates this week, that is the almost unanimous advice to individual investors from money managers and market strategists.
 Interest rates are going up, but unless inflation suddenly becomes a much more serious problem, they will do so only moderately, analysts say. As a result, the increases will probably not derail economic growth or corporate profits, which are soaring. And barring an unexpected shock like a terrorist attack or a big increase in oil prices, both the economy and the stock market appear reasonably healthy, they say. 
 ''Interest rates are going up for a good reason -- a stronger economy -- and that means higher corporate profits,'' said Sung Won Sohn, the chief economist for Wells Fargo, a bank based in San Francisco. For the next several months, those rising profits should provide a crucial lift for stocks, Mr. Sohn said.
 After rising sharply in 2003, stocks have been remarkably steady this year. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, which includes nearly all the largest stocks, has not fallen below 1,084.10 or risen above 1,157.76 this year, a range of 7 percent. It closed Friday at 1,134.43, down 6.22 points for the day and essentially flat for the week. For the year, the S.&P. 500 has risen 2 percent, while the Nasdaq composite index is up 1.1 percent and the Dow Jones industrial average has fallen 0.8 percent.
 Long-term interest rates are already rising, which ordinarily would hurt stocks, but this year soaring corporate profits have countered that effect, said Lee A. Scundi of Stevenson Capital Management, which manages more than $200 million. Profits at S.&P. 500 companies are expected to rise 14 percent this year and an additional 10 percent next year, according to Zacks Investment Research.
 With the S.&P. 500 expected to have aggregate profits of $61.19 a share in 2004, the index is trading at about 18.5 times earnings, which is just above the historical average. But considering that interest rates are still very low by historical standards, stocks have room to move higher as corporate profits rise, Mr. Scundi said.
 Once investors see for themselves that rising rates are having only a minor impact on growth, stocks will rise, he said. ''As for the second half of the year, I think it's going to be a lot stronger than the first half.''
 For a year, the Federal Reserve, the nation's central bank, has kept the federal funds rate, the rate charged on overnight loans of bank reserves, at 1 percent, its lowest level since the late 1950's. The Fed controls short-term rates through the federal funds rate, raising it when inflation seems to be rising and lowering it to give the economy a lift at times when it seems weak. Higher interest rates raise borrowing costs for consumers and businesses, which causes them to cut back on spending and thus slows economic growth. Lower rates have the opposite effect.
 For 2002 and much of 2003, the economy seemed to be sputtering, growing slowly and failing to create jobs. But years of ultralow interest rates and big government deficits appear to have provided the monetary and fiscal stimulus the economy needed to get back on track.
 On Friday, the Commerce Department reported that the economy had grown at an annual rate of 3.9 percent in the first three months of the year, lower than its original estimate of 4.4 percent but still healthy. Inflation rose at an annual rate of 2.9 percent, above the original 2.6 percent estimate.
 With prices creeping higher, the Federal Reserve has been signaling for months that it plans to begin raising short-term interest rates to make sure that inflation remains under control. But Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Fed, has also said repeatedly that he does not think inflation is currently a severe threat. So most professional investors expect the Fed to raise rates only moderately, slowing the economy slightly but not derailing the recovery that has gained strength over the last year.
 The consensus estimate is that the Fed will raise the federal funds rate a quarter-point on Wednesday, to 1.25 percent. One or two more quarter-point increases are expected before year-end, and more are expected in 2005. 
 Even so, most analysts expect the funds rate to remain below 3 percent for the foreseeable future, low by historical standards. As a result, interest rates on long-term bonds have also stayed very low by the standards of the last 30 years. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note has risen from 3.68 percent in March to 4.65 percent on Friday, but that yield is extremely low. Over the last 20 years the yield has averaged more than 7 percent, and rose as high as 13.8 percent in 1984.
 Long-term rates may rise further this year as the Fed increases short-term rates, Mr. Sohn said, but the increase will be moderate, so bond investors have no reason to panic. He predicts that the yield on the 10-year Treasury note will reach 5.2 percent by year-end.

HEADLINE: White House Aide Takes On Role As Bush's Eyes and Ears on Right

BYLINE: By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK

 BODY:
Karl Rove, the president's top political strategist, is famous in well-connected Washington for his tireless round of telephone calls and personal contacts with influential conservatives around the country. 
 But even Mr. Rove has his limits -- calls he cannot make, hands he cannot shake and meetings he cannot attend. For those, he has Timothy Goeglein.
 When opponents of abortion were holding a rally on Mr. Bush's first day in office, for example, Senator Sam Brownback, Republican of Kansas, called Mr. Goeglein from below the speakers' platform to press the White House for a statement of support. Within an hour, Mr. Brownback received a call with a vow that Mr. Bush would cancel federal support for international groups that provide or advise abortion, a break from the president's delicate approach to the issue during his campaign. 
 Mr. Goeglein, a slender, pink-cheeked 40-year-old Midwesterner who looks about half his age, is the official White House liaison to conservatives and to Christian groups. He is Mr. Rove's legman on the right. 
 ''He is a constant set of eyes and ears,'' said Edwin J. Feulner, president of the Heritage Foundation. Mr. Feulner said he saw Mr. Goeglein two or three times a week at meals, meetings or social events. ''If I have a message I want to get to Rove or the administration, I will scribble out a note to Tim, and within 24 hours I will get a response back. For lots of things, he is sort of one-stop shopping for a point of access to the administration.''
 Christian conservatives, in particular, say that Mr. Goeglein (pronounced GAIG-line) has been an important conduit to the White House for their demands that Mr. Bush stop financing family planning groups that support abortion, heavily publicize a signing of anti-abortion legislation, block stem-cell research and oppose same-sex marriage -- all calls that the president has heeded.
 Mr. Goeglein also delivers special messages to the administration's most conservative supporters. After the most recent State of the Union speech, for example, he attended two meetings of conservative leaders in Washington to highlight elements of the speech that were most appealing to them, like support for teaching abstinence in schools. But he also gave assurances of support for policies not mentioned in the speech, like an expansion of retirement accounts that would allow people to avoid taxes on most of their investment income. 
 In an interview in a briefing room near his office in the Old Executive Office Building adjacent to the White House, Mr. Goeglein -- an earnest speaker who punctuates his conversation with the phrase ''and I really do mean this'' -- insisted that his job was to convey information to and from the whole administration, not just Mr. Rove. ''The wonderful thing for me is that I recognize each and every day that I work for the president of the United States, the president of all the people, not some.'' 
 But conservatives outside the White House say they view Mr. Goeglein mainly as an extension of Mr. Rove. And stalwarts of the right say that, even as some conservatives have grown sharply critical of the administration's spending or of the war in Iraq, his function as a hot line to the White House helps keep the Bush administration more closely allied with their movement than any previous administration has been.
 ''This Bush administration does better than Reagan and better than his father, it is very methodical about reaching out to people to try to meet their concerns,'' said Paul Weyrich, a veteran conservative organizer.
 ''Every time I have expressed something to Tim, when I later would talk to Rove, he would be absolutely right up on it and know precisely what my position was, so he can't do better than that,'' Mr. Weyrich said.
 The Bush White House has other liaisons -- to big business, Jewish groups, high-tech companies -- but Mr. Rove has made courting conservatives and Christians a top political priority, in part to help turn out voters. Mr. Rove has often said conservative Christians disappointed him by about four million votes in 2000, nearly costing Mr. Bush the election.
 Mr. Goeglein usually attends a White House meeting around 8:30 a.m. each weekday with Mr. Rove and eight other officials to settle on the administration's message for the day. Most days, Mr. Goeglein and Mr. Rove are also in frequent contact by telephone and e-mail after that, Mr. Goeglein said. Mr. Rove said Mr. Goeglein's field reports from the conservative movement had helped the White House make a number of decisions, including formulating its policy limiting stem-cell research and promoting the signing of a bill restricting some abortions. 
 ''That is just a small list of the advice and help that Tim helps convey,'' Mr. Rove said in a telephone interview. ''He listens well and he is able to synthesize what he hears, so he is a good guy for getting a lay of the land and hearing what people are saying. For a movement that tends to be a little fractious at times, this is a guy who crosses all kinds of lines.'' 
 His agenda over the last two weeks has included speaking to the Southern Baptist Convention in Indianapolis; meeting with alliances of conservative groups about the president's ''healthy marriage initiatives'' and about judicial appointment battles in Washington; conducting a conference call with religious leaders to extol improvements in the economy; helping orchestrate the award of the Medal of Freedom to the neoconservative thinker Norman Podhoretz and the former Wall Street Journal editorial page editor Robert L. Bartley; attending a book party for the Washington executive director of the Federalist Society, the conservative legal group; and conducting a conference call with the chairman of the Republican Party for Catholics across the country. 
 A descendant of Macedonian immigrants, Mr. Goeglein grew up in Fort Wayne, Ind., in a family with few strong political commitments. The family attended a liberal Lutheran church, although Mr. Goeglein ultimately joined the church's more traditionalist Missouri Synod.
 Mr. Goeglein began his career in politics working for Senator Daniel R. Coats of Indiana. In 2000, Mr. Goeglein was the spokesman for Gary L. Bauer in his Christian conservative campaign against Mr. Bush for the Republican presidential nomination. 
 Mr. Goeglein often helps the White House deal with specific religious concerns about public policy, like the beliefs of some evangelical Protestants about the place of modern Israel in biblical prophecy. For example, when the Bush administration supported Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's plan for Israel's unilateral withdrawal from parts of the Gaza Strip, some evangelical Christians questioned Mr. Bush's move for biblical reasons. Mr. Goeglein set up briefings with Elliott Abrams, who is in charge of Middle Eastern affairs, and top national security officials. 
 ''There were some evangelical concerns about a two-state solution,'' said Jay Sekulow, a friend of Mr. Goeglein's and chief counsel for the conservative American Center for Law and Justice. ''Tim did a very effective job explaining the rationale for that,'' he said. ''After meetings with the relevant people that Tim set up, I was satisfied, and apparently Sharon was as well.'' 
 Mr. Goeglein said that of the time he devotes to religious groups, about 65 percent is spent with Protestants and 35 percent with Catholics, and he also stays in touch with the editors of publications like The Weekly Standard and National Review. 
 For a member of the White House staff, he courts his conservative constituents with unusual deference. At a meeting of conservative organizers earlier this year, for example, Mr. Weyrich chided Mr. Goeglein for a making a hasty exit. Mr. Goeglein, who was due at an important meeting back at the White House, responded politely: ''I am very sorry, sir. You know I love you, and you know I love you all.''

HEADLINE: The Hollow Alliance

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE. 
E-mail: safire@nytimes.com

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
At this week's NATO summit conference in Istanbul, it will be in the political interest of America's European adversaries -- France's Jacques Chirac and Germany's Gerhard Schroder -- to appear to cooperate with the coalition helping Iraq complete its liberation.
 At the same time, it is in the political interest of George W. Bush and Britain's Tony Blair to appear to be delighted with whatever safe and cheap aid that the Chirac-Schroder bloc allows NATO to offer instead of supplying alliance troops. 
 In this way, the French and German leaders can tell their nations that no diplomatic cost was attached to their opposition to removing Saddam Hussein. And Bush and Blair can face elections this year and next, able to make two claims: that the prewar split in the Western alliance has happily healed, and that the war was justified by the belated blessing of the leaders who fled from the fight. 
 Behind this facade, however, exists a hollowed-out alliance. Its previous common purpose -- to block the westward march of Soviet imperialism -- has not been replaced by a new purpose: to defeat imperial terrorism. Unless the democracies of France and Germany elect leaders capable of grasping that current challenge, NATO will continue to atrophy, supplanted by ad hoc coalitions of the willing to meet emergencies.
 Such a withering of the West's grand alliance is not inevitable. Although savants in the U.S. seem certain that Bush and Blair will be punished by voters for their sin of strangling the worst regime in the cradle of terror, the view I get from London is different.
 Britain's Labor Party is unlikely to thrust aside its eloquent leader and proven vote-getter. Blair has recently flummoxed internal dissenters as well as opposing Tories by proposing referendums not just on giving up economic sovereignty to Continental bankers but also on turning over political sovereignty to the bureaucrats of Brussels in the proposed European constitution. Like a strong majority of Euroskeptical Britons, Blair is now lukewarm on both issues, which snatches the clothes of the Tories.
 Bush should accede to his stalwart ally's request for the release of four British subjects now held in Guantanamo, underscoring the special relationship. And as the interim government in Baghdad puts a nationalistic Iraqi face on its internal battle, Bush and Blair will be bolstered politically by (a) the reality of a shift in the war's fortunes as well as (b) the papering-over of the cracks in the wall of NATO solidarity. 
 Presume that Bush wins re-election this year and Blair the next. Further presume (and I know all this is hard to do) that necessary belt-tightening in France and Germany, at a time when unemployment is stuck near double digits, takes its toll at the polls. 
 Germany's Schroder is a political zombie, with a Thatcheresque successor in the wings. The sclerotic government of Chirac is desperately trying to block the rise of the charismatic finance minister, Nicolas Sarkozy. This savvy dynamo of Hungarian descent, 49, is tough on immigration, France's sleeper issue. Though he would surely irritate London and Washington in the grand French tradition, Sarkozy would probably not align himself with a German politician to treat the rest of Europe, as does Chirac, as children not well brought up. 
 Dare to think the unthinkable: What would the Western alliance look like if Bush and Blair receive fresh mandates, and Chirac and Schroder give way to leaders who see the modern collective defense in sponsorship of freedom outside their area? What if NATO is given new life by the urgent need to confront the new threat of terror networks?
 Then we would see the emergence of NATO II, no longer North Atlantic but tied by need for citizen safety. It would not compete with the United Nations as a universal forum for debate and funneler of humanitarian aid, but be led by democracies willing to make proportionate sacrifices to provide for the common defense. 
 Of course, today's hollowed-out NATO could continue down the path of pretended mutuality that we will see in Turkey this week. And the voters of its member nations may follow Spain in choosing leaders averse to the cost of collective security. But as the old NATO showed, nations find safety in numbers.

HEADLINE: Sun Moving to Underscore New Strategy

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, June 25 

 BODY:
Sun Microsystems will open its JavaOne software conference here on Monday by announcing several partnerships intended to strengthen the company's position in the rapidly growing mobile Internet business. This year's event will also underscore Sun's shift to a lower-cost, industry standard chip strategy for corporate server markets.
 Sun's Java language competes with Microsoft's Visual Studio as systems that programmers use to design software. At this year's event, which will be held through Thursday, Sun will introduce a new software system, called Java Creator, that is intended to simplify the task of writing software applications. 
 Sun will announce new partnerships with both Orange and Vodafone, the two largest European cellphone companies, to develop new Java-based applications for cellphone handsets. The wireless phone market is one where Sun has a clear lead over Microsoft, whose efforts have been resisted both by handset manufacturers and by cellular network operators. Both industries have been concerned about the dominance of Microsoft's Windows operating system in the personal computer industry.
 The company, in showing that its Java software strategy is propelling the computer maker into new markets, is expected to announce that there are now four million Java software developers and that the programming language has become a standard tool in cellular phone, automotive and other consumer electronics markets.
 The company's new president, Jonathan Schwartz, is also leading Sun to rely less on its proprietary Sparc microprocessor chip and more on systems based on Advanced Micro Device's 64-bit Opteron microprocessor, which has shown surprising strength in business and Internet applications. 
 Sun is the last major computer maker to recover from the technology industry recession, having had big losses and layoffs in both 2001 and 2002. Some industry analysts have dismissed any chance of recovery for Sun, arguing that the company is increasingly squeezed between Microsoft's Windows monopoly and the open-source world of the Linux operating system. 
 Sun, based in Santa Clara, Calif., has been searching for a middle ground and is betting that it will be able to gain market share in the transition from 32-bit to 64-bit systems in business computing markets.
 Last quarter, Sun disappointed analysts and its stock has fallen, closing Friday at $4.41, down from a high of $5.93 in January. However, several people with knowledge of the company's business said that two factors -- surprising demand for its low-cost A.M.D.-based servers and the first signs that the telecommunications industry is beginning to recover -- could help the computer maker significantly in its fourth quarter, which ends Wednesday.
 In an interview this week at Sun's research and development campus in Menlo Park, Calif., Mr. Schwartz said the company was determined to compete effectively in the high-volume, low-cost server market that is dominated by computers based on microprocessors sold by Intel and A.M.D.
 ''The keys to the kingdom in the developer world are based on volume,'' Mr. Schwartz said. ''We're acutely sensitive to the volume question.''
 Sun's effort in the standard server world is expected to pick up steam later this year when it introduces the first A.M.D.-based products designed by Andreas Bechtolsheim, a co-founder of the company. Mr. Bechtolsheim returned to Sun earlier this year when the computer maker acquired his start-up company, Kealia Inc.
 Along with three partners, Mr. Bechtolsheim created Sun in the early 1980's by introducing a low-cost workstation computer based on standard industry parts. 
 The Opteron strategy is widely believed to be Sun's best opportunity to pull out of its troubles, even though the company is only now starting to sell significant numbers of the systems.
 ''This is the first quarter that Sun has any volume,'' said Mark Stahlman, a computer industry at Caris & Company, an investment bank based in New York. Demand for the servers has outstripped the company's supply, he said.
 Sun is expected to announce on Monday that it is contributing a portion of its Java Desktop System, the company's version of the Linux operating system, to the open-source community. The software technology, called Project Looking Glass and Java 3d, makes it possible to develop images that have more depth than conventional images on computer displays.
 Mr. Schwartz will also announce that he plans to begin writing his own Web log on a regular basis. Several Sun employees maintain online dairies, known as blogs, at both official and unofficial Web sites. Mr. Schwartz said he was interested in reaching a computer industry audience directly, unfiltered by reporters.

HEADLINE: Brackish Waters of a Leaky, Ramshackle Canal Reflect the Woes of Trying to Rebuild Iraq

BYLINE: By JAMES GLANZ

DATELINE: BASRA, Iraq 

 BODY:
A journey down the wandering, ramshackle course of the Sweet Water Canal, the hapless and ironically named waterway that was designed as a lifeline for the people in this country's parched southern desert, could be seen as an allegory for everything that has gone wrong with the American-led reconstruction of Iraq.
 American engineers figured that the canal, completed only six years ago, was a basically sound source of water for this city of two million people. A little dredging and patching and it would be like new. Instead, they found a nightmare of substandard construction, malfunctioning equipment and haphazardly repaired leaks. Looting after the American-led invasion made matters immeasurably worse.
 The first big leak that caught the attention of the American engineers came last December, 117 miles below the spot where the canal taps into a relatively unpolluted tributary of the Tigris River. In the chaos and lawlessness of the occupation, inspections of the canal had ceased, and the flowing water gnawed a huge hole that created dire shortages until it was fixed. 
 The leaks kept coming, even though the Americans and their allies had begun pouring millions of dollars into repairs on the canal and on the silt-choked reservoirs, nonfunctioning water-treatment plants and porous underground piping networks that try -- and abysmally fail -- to bring clean and safe water into citizens' homes.
 On June 18, workers swarmed around the latest giant leak in forbidding country about 15 miles from the first gusher, as a snorting backhoe scooped and swatted at the soupy mess, trying to pat clay into place and make a temporary plug. Now, even Iraqi engineers who praise the Americans' efforts say that water supplies here are at best still no better than they were under Saddam Hussein's government.
 ''As with a lot of things here, the canal was reaching the point where it was going to break down,'' said Thomas H. Stahl, regional representative for southern Iraq for the United States Agency for International Development. Mr. Stahl grew up in Basra and other towns in Iraq and Kuwait as the son of missionaries in the 1950's and 1960's.
 ''If you think of Iraq as a used car,'' Mr. Stahl said, quoting an epigram that he said was making the rounds among development officials, ''Saddam sold it just in time.''
 To date, the development agency has financed roughly $50 million in work on the canal and other regional water systems, and it has been carried out by the engineering giant Bechtel and its Iraqi subcontractors. The project is months behind and may never be completed as originally envisioned.
 Nassar Hussan, the director general of the central water treatment plant for Basra, said the Western engineers had done a good job on the parts of the project they had been able to finish. But Mr. Hussan said that for the moment, lagging repairs to the canal and soaring demand in the hot weather had left him with less than half the water he needed to meet the city's requirements.
 ''Because of the summer season and the slow maintenance, this causes big problems,'' Mr. Hussan said.
 Moreover, Basra is a town where the peace is especially fragile, as shown when violent protests over electricity and gasoline shortages broke out here last August. At a raucous but peaceful protest in front of the governorate building recently over shortcomings in a variety of city services, Hussein Ali, who said he was head of the local democratic party, was asked about the quality of the city's tap water.
 ''What water?'' Mr. Ali said. ''There isn't any water.''
 In fact, Mr. Ali eventually conceded, city taps do sporadically flow with hard, unclean water, suitable at most for washing. He said the poor, who cannot always afford bottled water, were forced to drink the unpalatable liquid. But Samer Murtadha, a guard at a used car lot in Basra's Al Jazair neighborhood, made it clear how undesirable that expedient was. He said he would drink the water only ''if I have to die.''
 For all its desert wasteland, with summer temperatures routinely rising above 120 degrees, Basra was not always a place without potable water. The Shatt al Arab, the waterway formed by the confluence of the Tigris and the Euphrates, flows through town.
 But dozens of dams and hydroelectric plants built on the two rivers in Turkey and Syria in the 1980's and 1990's drastically reduced the flow of water downstream and accelerated a long trend toward brackish, unhealthy water because of agricultural runoff and other pollution. Raw sewage dumped into the Tigris in Baghdad fouled the river further.
 Even worse, shelling during the 1980-to-1988 Iran-Iraq war tore up underground water pipes in Basra. The leaks are still so bad that sewage seeps into the system and at least 60 percent of the water is lost. Ponds from the leaks were so large that they began appearing on official city maps. Mr. Hussein's government, with astonishing indifference to Iraq's infrastructure, did little or nothing to fix the problems.
 ''Everything is destroyed in Basra,'' said Muhenned A. al-Suhail, a civil engineer in the city who is working with the Coalition Provisional Authority and another Western contractor, Mott MacDonald, on repair projects. ''It is destroyed because of the war and because of the lack of maintenance.''
 Finally, the government built the Sweet Water Canal, finished only in 1998, and traveling nearly 150 miles across the desert from the Nahr Al Gharaf River. But the work was so substandard that long stretches of the concrete and clay liner already look like a crumbling ancient ruin. 
 ''The leakage problem with the canal is so much worse than anybody anticipated,'' said James Stephenson, the mission director in Iraq for the development agency.
 Initially, the agency and Bechtel figured they would be in business with a little patching and a refurbishment of the canal's pumping stations. But the canal turned out to be so delicate that the friction generated by pushing much more water through the canal with stronger pumps could have torn the structure apart.
 And doing really major fixes on the holes that kept cropping up would have required damming the canal for long periods. Because Basra has almost no capacity for storing water, it was not possible to stop the flow for more than a few days.
 Scorching, gritty winds swept across the spot where the latest leak had created a big pond on the desert, while workers struggled with heavy equipment to create a plug. As guards armed with automatic weapons scattered around the area to protect a group of visitors from attacks, it was hard to see how workers could make it through a full day in good health, let alone complete a construction project.
 ''If this washes out,'' a Bechtel engineer shouted over the wind and the din of the equipment, ''it could shut down the supply of water to Basra for two to four weeks.''
 Farther downstream, other problems are apparent. A man in a dirty white T-shirt was bathing in the canal at one spot, and pipes for illicitly siphoning the water -- probably by the Bedouin tribes that rove through the area -- emerged from the side of the canal at another place.
 By the time the water reaches Mr. Hassan's water-treatment plant, its level is well below the dark stain on the concrete. ''You can see the line that is the normal level before the war,'' Mr. Hassan said.
 Farther along in the water's journey, a neighborhood project to lay new underground pipes and reduce the leakage was delayed because a Western supply company said it was too dangerous to deliver materials. Trenches were dug for the pipes along a busy road, but now they have filled with trash and partly collapsed, so workers are digging them out again.
 The blue pipes have finally arrived and are lying next to the trenches, but engineers at the site are talking about two sisters, translators for the local Coalition Provisional Authority, who only a few days earlier were murdered for working with the Americans.
 Mr. Suhail, in as understated a way as he could manage, said, ''There is a little risk, really.''

HEADLINE: In Anger, Ordinary Iraqis Are Joining the Insurgency

BYLINE: By EDWARD WONG; Zaineb Obeid contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: BAQUBA, Iraq, June 27 

 BODY:
At a teahouse in this palm-lined city, jobless men sit on wooden benches talking about killing American soldiers.
 ''Tell us one benefit they've given us since they've come here,'' Falah, a 23-year-old man in a shabby checkered shirt, said to an Iraqi reporter.
 He boasted about driving a friend to stage attacks on American patrols. The two wait in a farm field by the main road. When the Humvees roll by, his friend fires a rocket-propelled grenade, Falah said. The two hit the ground. The soldiers open fire, but the Iraqis lie still until the patrol leaves. 
 ''I really didn't ask my friend whether they have a boss or not and whether they organize their work or not,'' he said. ''I really don't care as long as I can take part and drive the Americans out of our country. We are all resistance.''
 As Falah spoke, about a dozen men gathered around him. They nodded vigorously. This was Sunni-dominated Baquba, 35 miles northeast of Baghdad, where the resistance burns as fiercely as anywhere in Iraq.
 With just days to go before the transfer of sovereignty to the Iraqis, American commanders concede that they are far from quelling a stubborn and increasingly sophisticated insurgency. It has extended well beyond Saddam Hussein supporters and foreign fighters, spreading to ordinary Iraqis seething at the occupation and its failures. They act at the grass-roots level, often with little training or direction, but with a zealousness born of anti-colonial ambitions.
 American commanders acknowledge that military might alone cannot defeat the insurgency; in fact, the frequent use of force often spurs resistance by deepening ill will.
 ''This war cannot be won militarily,'' said Maj. Gen. John R. S. Batiste, commander of the First Infantry Division, which oversees a swath of the northern Sunni triangle slightly larger than the state of West Virginia. ''It really does need a political and economic solution.''
 But the new government will find it tough to hammer out solutions to problems like high unemployment and lack of electricity any time soon. It will continue to come under attack, American troops will remain exposed, and the elections scheduled for January 2005 could be at risk. The Americans hope that the resistance will view the new government as legitimate, but insurgents are already assassinating Iraqi officials, and violence continues to inflame virtually every corner of the country.
 On Saturday, black-clad insurgents here attacked the offices of the Iraqi National Accord, the party of the new prime minister, Iyad Allawi. The interim government has to persuade the people that it can protect everyone. The insurgents have a much easier task, one they have performed with considerable success so far: sow enough fear into people to undermine confidence in authority.
 General Batiste said he did not expect the violence to subside after the transfer of sovereignty on Wednesday. A jobless man can still make $100 by agreeing to plant a roadside bomb or shoot at the Americans. ''It'll be a busy summer,'' the general said.
 American officials say Hussein supporters and foreigners like the Jordanian terrorist Abu Musab al-Zarqawi are directing some cells and are suspects in the major car bomb attacks and recent beheadings.
 But much of the insurgency reflects street-level anger at the lack of progress in Iraq. The unemployment rate is still as high as 60 percent in many parts of the Sunni triangle, the region at the heart of the resistance. Iraqis complain about the chronic lack of power and clean water. Hard-line clerics are attacking the occupation in their sermons and are more popular than ever.
 At the teahouse here, a muscular 40-year-old who gave his name as Abu Meshaal said: ''We have experts in explosives and bomb making, ex-officers who have experience with such missions. We are everywhere, and we will not stop our work until the last soldier leaves Iraq.
 ''Each day, I get more enthusiastic when I hear that explosions are taking place here and there, in Baghdad and other provinces,'' he added.
 The Sunni triangle -- bounded by Ramadi and Falluja to the west, Tikrit to the north and Baquba to the east -- remains the most troubled area in the country. In the south, the thousands-strong Shiite militia led by the firebrand cleric Moktada al-Sadr has quieted down in recent weeks, as the popular Mr. Sadr takes baby steps to jump into politics.
 The total number of insurgents remains unclear, largely because American officials sorely lack reliable human intelligence. The insurgency does not appear to have a central command structure, said a military intelligence analyst in the Sunni triangle. Cells work independently but occasionally give each other logistical support or intelligence.
 There are philosophical divisions within the resistance. Some Iraqis who support an armed struggle against the Americans bristle at bombs that kill their fellow citizens, insisting that only foreigner fighters are capable of such carnage. Some of those attacks could be a result of sectarian tensions flaring up among Sunni Arabs, Shiite Arabs and Kurds. 
 But during the broad uprising across Iraq in April, a rare confluence of Sunni Muslim and Shiite Muslim insurgents took place in Baquba, as the Shiite followers of Mr. Sadr tried overrunning government buildings while Sunni fighters battled American forces. 
 Other groups appear to have moved in since, and the city now harbors a caldron of cells working together, officers say.
 The April uprisings woke commanders up to the fact that the nature of the resistance had morphed into a more widespread movement than they had previously thought.
 That transformation began in November. As the insurgency appeared to grow in strength that month, the military cracked down hard on supporters of Mr. Hussein. Their role in the insurgency waned, and the nature of the resistance became ''a fusion between nationalist and Islamist sentiments among the Sunnis'' that allowed leaders to recruit a broader pool of fighters, wrote Ahmed Hashim, a professor at the U.S. Naval War College, in a recent paper on the insurgency.
 Professor Hashim, who has interviewed American commanders and insurgents in Iraq, said the anti-occupation movement has ''benefited tremendously'' from its new populist orientation.
 ''There is really no way to be charitable about this,'' he wrote. ''From the vantage point of spring 2004, the U.S. has failed at all levels except the tactical military level; which, ironically, is the least important of all the levels in a counterinsurgency campaign.''
 Here in Baquba, commanders with the First Infantry Division say they face a more formidable foe than the one that confronted their predecessors from the Fourth Infantry Division, which left in March.
 ''The complexity has changed,'' said Lt. Col. Steve Bullimore, commander of Task Force 1-6 Field Artillery, responsible for controlling Baquba proper. ''The Fourth I.D. was finishing a war, cleaning up the bad guys. While that was happening, the infant insurgency was starting. Now it's more robust.''
 Commanders in Baquba said they have seen fighters operating recently in squads of about 20 each.
 If Americans retaliate with overwhelming firepower, the insurgents simply melt away into the alleyways and farm fields. 
 In a pitched battle here on Thursday, insurgents set off roadside bombs to paralyze American patrols, then fired on them with AK-47's and rocket-propelled grenades, officers said. The incidence of roadside bombings -- an efficient killer of soldiers -- increased from 80 or so in April to more than 100 in May, said Col. Dana Pittard, commander of the Third Brigade Combat Team.
 Insurgents have also turned their attacks to prime infrastructure sites like power stations and oil pipelines. 
 Interpreters for the military regularly receive threatening letters at their homes, and insurgents hand out fliers in the crowded bazaars threatening collaborators. 
 ''They're very good at information operations,'' said Capt. Travis Van Hecke, an artillery commander here. ''People are reluctant to help us.''
 In short, the insurgents understand that the center of gravity in this war is the support of the people. In Baquba, fighters usually distribute fliers in town hours before an attack, telling people to stay off the streets and close their shops.
 But no one stirs up popular support better than the hard-line clerics. Their mosques have become rallying points for the insurgency.
 ''Is there a country that is subjected to occupation, abuse, looting and the stealing of his fortunes and killing of his people, but that when he raises his voice and says, 'No!' it's called terrorism?'' Sheik Shehab Ahmed al-Badri, the imam of the main Sunni mosque in Baquba, said in an interview on Friday.
 ''The reality is that the new government represents the occupation and its desire to stay here,'' he said. ''We want full sovereignty.''

HEADLINE: For Jeter, Slump? What Slump?

BYLINE: By DAVE CALDWELL

 BODY:
A tempting pitch would wink at Derek Jeter in the first month of the season, and he would often lunge at it, as if the baseball would pop like a scented soap bubble if he waited. Jeter loves to play baseball, but he knew he was way too enthusiastic.
 ''Instead of staying with the ball, you're jumping at it,'' Jeter said yesterday. ''That may sound funny when the ball's coming at you at 90 miles an hour, but you've just got to let it come.'' 
 Around the time that his batting average fell to .161, he realized something: Every pitch has to get to home plate. So he waited.
 Yankees Manager Joe Torre said yesterday that videos of Jeter batting in April look much different from videos of Jeter batting now.
 So do the results. Mets pitcher Steve Trachsel threw Jeter three pitches in his first two at-bats yesterday. Jeter knocked two of those pitches, both fastballs, over the fence, propelling the Yankees to an 8-1 victory in the first game of a doubleheader at Yankee Stadium.
 Jeter lashed a single in his fourth at-bat and scored again when Hideki Matsui belted a grand-slam home run in the eighth inning. Jeter's batting average stood at .266 after the game.
 Jeter went 1 for 4 in the second game, an 11-5 Yankees' victory, but he still contributed. He was hit in the left arm in his first at-bat and scored a run. He fielded a fifth-inning grounder that hit Mike Mussina's leg first, and he threw out Mike Piazza.
 Jeter is batting .386 in June, with 9 home runs and 16 runs batted in. The Yankees, who were 10-11 when Jeter's average bottomed out, are 17-7 this month.
 ''Right now, he's got an idea of what he wants to do, and he's very, very confident in what he's doing,'' Torre said.
 The Yankees joked that the resurgence might be because of Jeter's age. He turned 30 on Saturday. As catcher John Flaherty said: ''Derek is turning 30. He's turned into a good hitter.''
 Jeter said, ''I'm still younger than almost anyone in here.''
 Gary Sheffield, who also hit a homer in the first game of the doubleheader, said Jeter's demeanor was no different in June from what it was in April. Don Mattingly, the Yankees' first-year hitting coach, said Jeter simply seemed to have a better feel for where pitches were headed.
 ''I don't really have an answer why he's doing well now, just like I didn't have an answer for what was happening before,'' Mattingly said. ''He's just doing his thing. Derek's really locked in. I just wish I could have done something that I could say helped him, but he's worked out of it himself.''
 Torre has noticed that Jeter is hitting many balls into the center third of the outfield, the area from left-center to right-center. Torre said that was a sign that Jeter was swinging the bat particularly well.
 Jeter is also swinging economically. He could remember taking only four swings in the first game yesterday. Two swings resulted in his 12th and 13th home runs of the season, and another hit zipped past Mets third baseman Ty Wigginton.
 Jeter's first-inning home run yesterday -- to left field -- had Torre reminiscing about a homer Jeter hit nearly four years ago.
 On Oct. 25, 2000, Jeter led off Game 4 of the World Series at Shea Stadium by walloping a home run off Bobby J. Jones to power the Yankees to a 3-2 victory. The Yankees won the Series the next night.
 On Saturday, the Mets pummeled the lackluster Yankees, 9-3. Jeter was not the leadoff hitter yesterday; the Mets batted first, and Kenny Lofton led off the bottom of the first with a groundout.
 Jeter said he thought Yankees starter Jose Contreras might pitch better if the Yankees scored quickly. So he rapped a 1-0 fastball from Trachsel into the seats behind the left-field fence.
 ''You don't necessarily need to hit a home run,'' Jeter said. ''But we didn't play well yesterday. We wanted to come out and play well, and score early.''
 Sheffield went to the plate and took Trachsel's first pitch for a ball. Sheffield belted his second pitch over the fence in left-center and onto the net that protects the monuments. Contreras had a 2-0 lead.
 The Yankees scratched out a run in the second inning to build a 3-0 lead. Jeter led off the third. Trachsel threw him a fastball over the middle of the plate. Jeter muscled it over the fence in right-center.
 Trachsel did not allow another hit until Jeter led off the eighth with his third hit of the game. Jeter does not use his home run count as a barometer; his primary job is to get on base and let the middle of the batting order drive him home.
 Jeter repeated yesterday that he was hitting the ball during his month-long slump; the difference was that the other team was catching it. But he kept his patience, and he has had a chance to fortify his statistics.
 ''You don't go hanging your head because you struggled for a couple of weeks,'' Jeter said.

HEADLINE: Saudis in Terror's Shadow

 BODY:
Ever since President Bush set his sights on war, many Americans have looked around the world and wondered if Iraq was really the worst problem out there. North Korea, and probably Iran, are the countries busily creating nuclear weapons in defiance of international law. Sudanese leaders worked closely with Osama bin Laden and slaughter their people as callously as Saddam Hussein did. Pakistan has provided nuclear weapons technology and fuel to rogue nations.
 And then there is Saudi Arabia, which produced the young men who flew planes into the World Trade Center and whose wealthy citizens were probably the main funders of the attacks. The independent commission on 9/11 recently concluded that Al Qaeda got no financial support from Saudi Arabia's government or senior officials in the period leading up to 9/11. Any direct cooperation between Saudi intelligence agencies and Osama bin Laden probably ended well over a decade ago, with the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan. Since then, the Saudi government has had no reason to want to help Al Qaeda directly. In the early 1990's, Mr. bin Laden denounced Saudi rulers for allowing American troops to be stationed in the kingdom. In 1994, Riyadh revoked his Saudi citizenship. 
 However, unofficial tolerance continued. Lax government monitoring of charitable foundations and the money they sent overseas allowed large sums to flow into terrorist training and operations. Without this money, Al Qaeda would have had trouble financing some of its most ambitious attacks. Saudi rulers winked at the terrorist operations as long as they were directed outside their borders. They provided crucial support for the Taliban, while it provided sanctuary and training bases to Osama bin Laden. They began cracking down on terrorist cells within the kingdom only when Al Qaeda expanded its targets to include sites and people within Saudi Arabia itself.
 Still, it's good news that the Saudis are getting serious, even if it is simply a matter of self-preservation. Lately Crown Prince Abdullah, the country's de facto ruler, has moved to hunt down terrorists and cut off their finances, and remove inflammatory clerics from their pulpits. The vicious kidnappings and assaults on foreign workers in recent weeks, including the beheading of an American, were certainly a shock to Saudis who need non-Arabs to help run the vast oil industry.
 But the terrorists may have had help from low-level officials in the police or other government agencies, where attitudes toward Al Qaeda are more favorable. The Saudi people have been exposed to years of preaching in favor of violent global jihad by senior Wahhabi clerics, whose backing is a main source of legitimacy for the Saudi royal family. That helps explain why a poll taken late last year showed half of all Saudis supporting Osama bin Laden's rhetoric. 
 Encouragingly, the overwhelming majority of Saudis rejected Mr. bin Laden's political leadership and terrorist tactics. But some do not, and American citizens living in Saudi Arabia are going to need extensive assurance that the government is rooting out Qaeda sympathizers, particularly from the police and security forces.
 The United States, which depends on Saudi Arabia not only for support in the fight against terror but also for its role in moderating world oil prices, will certainly continue to work with the kingdom and its leaders. It actually has little choice. But if Washington is interested in long-term stability in Saudi Arabia, it must press harder for reform. Mr. bin Laden's rhetoric strikes a resonant chord among Saudis who are increasingly anxious about the economy and their own uncertain employment prospects. The kingdom uneasily combines a 21st-century oil industry, an absolutist and hugely corrupt family monarchy, and a fiery, fundamentalist religious establishment. 
 In the narrow spectrum of Saudi royal politics, Crown Prince Abdullah is a reformer. If he presses ahead with the bold changes Saudi Arabia needs he can expect fierce resistance from other princes and influential clerics. But without thoroughgoing reforms, the House of Saud faces a bleak and violent future.

HEADLINE: Bookstores' Sales Reveal Something About Their Neighborhoods

BYLINE: By SABRINA TAVERNISE

 BODY:
To find out who lives in specific New York City neighborhoods, call the Census Bureau. To determine which neighborhoods have the most crime, ask the Police Department. But to learn what is on a neighborhood's mind, visit its bookstores. 
 Barnes & Noble, Borders and Shakespeare & Company all have a number of stores in Manhattan and keep careful statistics on neighborhood likes and dislikes. They regularly examine sales figures and stock each store's shelves by focusing on what the neighborhood wants. 
 The companies agreed to share recent sales patterns for the most popular categories in various stores around Manhattan. Though it is not a scientific survey, the companies combined do sell more than a fifth of all books sold in New York City bookstores. 
 And while best sellers are much the same throughout the city (they are, after all, best sellers), the sales lists show that each neighborhood has its own reading cravings.
 Sometimes, the sales reveal secrets. One of the most popular genres at Borders's Wall Street store, after business? Books on gambling. The only Shakespeare store in Manhattan where sex books simply do not sell? The Upper East Side. 
 The Barnes & Noble store on Broadway and 82nd Street sells more psychology and psychiatry books than any other Barnes & Noble in the country, a fact that depending on your interpretation, could be either a sign of robust mental health or serious instability among Upper West Siders.
 In other cases, the sales figures show neighborhood change. Does the Barnes & Noble in Greenwich Village sell the most gay and lesbian literature? No, that would be its store in Chelsea, a neighborhood with a newer gay population. 
 Daren Sealey, manager of the Barnes & Noble store at Astor Place on the Village's eastern edge, said sales at his store now consisted of ''much more mainstream stuff.'' 
 ''It's a totally different clientele,'' he said.
 The lists can belie stereotypes. The Upper East Side, often seen as the land of ladies who lunch, has book tastes more befitting homebodies who cook. Cookbooks and children's books sell the best at both the Barnes & Noble and Shakespeare stores in the neighborhood, according to the sales statistics. 
 The lists can also confirm stereotypes. Which Barnes & Noble store, for example, sells the most performing arts books? (Drumroll.) The store at Lincoln Center. What about books on etiquette and appearance? Borders statistics show that they sell best at the store (surprise!) on Park Avenue and 57th Street. 
 New York bookstores have changed a lot in recent years. Independent stores have closed as national chains have expanded. In the five years ended in 1997, the number of bookstores in New York City fell by 19 percent, to 241 stores, according to the Census Bureau's economic data.
 Shakespeare, the independent store with the most locations in the city (four in Manhattan and two in Brooklyn), had to close its Upper West Side store in 1996 as business slumped.
 ''The harshest reality is Manhattan real estate,'' said Linda Marotta, the head buyer for Shakespeare. ''It's just become very hard to survive.''
 But revenues from book sales have not declined. On the contrary, from 1992 to 1997, book sale receipts in New York City rose by 29 percent, to $408 million, according to regional economic census statistics for that period. 
 So book buyers still have deep pockets, and nowhere is this more in evidence than on the Upper East Side. Hardcover books sell best there for all three companies and new books of any genre sell well, the companies said.
 ''This is the only store in my career where people hold up a paperback and ask me if it comes in hardcover,'' said Frank Barilla, the manager of the Barnes & Noble at 86th Street and Second Avenue.
 As for the neighborhood's indifference to sex books, shoppers there have recently all but rejected ''The Multi-Orgasmic Man: Sexual Secrets Every Man Should Know,'' which has been a hit in other Shakespeare stores, Ms. Marotta said. 
 But cookbooks are an entirely different matter. Upper East Siders particularly love those with a celebrity flair. ''Lidia's Italian-American Kitchen,'' based on Lidia Bastianich's television show, sells well there. So does ''The Barefoot Contessa Cookbook,'' with recipes from a Hamptons specialty food store, Ms. Marotta said. 
 ''Anything with a Hamptons tie-in will sell up there,'' she said. 
 On the Upper West Side, the psychology section at Barnes & Noble's 82nd Street store takes up 10 rows of floor-to-ceiling shelves.
 On a recent Thursday, Nora Osher, a nurse from Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, browsed the section holding a stack of seven books on bipolar disorder, autism and depression.
 ''Whatever you want, they have,'' she said. ''Look, they even have books on kleptomania.''
 Another browser, Teddy Moskowitz, winkingly referred to the neighborhood as a place with ''a lot of people who are treating and need to be treated.''
 Downtown, the shelves are packed with other topics.
 ''We have a young, hip customer who likes to go to art galleries, restaurants and the theater,'' said Karen Catalanotti, manager at the Barnes & Noble store in Chelsea. That store and the company's Union Square store sell more art books than any other of the company's stores. And few children's books are flying off the shelves here. ''Our customers' pets are their kids,'' Ms. Catalanotti said. ''There are even a few who come in with cats on leashes.''
 Financial district sales show an eclectic mix of tastes. The Shakespeare store on Whitehall Street competes with the company's Brooklyn stores for best sales of African-American women's fiction. Professional wrestling books also sell well there. 
 At the Borders store at 100 Broadway, books on gambling sell briskly. Peter Gerardi, who works at a brokerage firm, was among the section's browsers this month. He goes to the store from his Wall Street office to look for books on blackjack, he said.
 Two aisles from the gambling section, Dong Shaw, a financial consultant, sat in an armchair reading.
 ''I gamble on the stock market, so it's enough risk,'' he said. 
 ''I want my brain to be relaxed after hours,'' he added, turning back to the book in his lap. Its topic? The Chinese economy. Light lunchtime reading, he said.

HEADLINE: Illinois County Cancels Bond Sale After S.E.C. Questions Brokers

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Cook County in Illinois scrapped a $200 million bond sale yesterday after the Securities and Exchange Commission questioned whether brokers had misled investors about securities with yields reset periodically by auction bids.
 ''The disclosure the S.E.C. was looking into these was the final nail in the coffin,'' said Thomas J. Glaser, Cook County's chief financial officer. ''We're not going to do them.'' 
 The inquiry may discourage other sellers in the $204 billion auction-rate securities market and reduce profits at underwriters like Citigroup and UBS, the two biggest managers of such sales. 
 The S.E.C. asked brokers to disclose ''potentially deceptive, dishonest or unfair practices'' during auctions used to set rates for the debt, according to a memorandum sent to trade association members.
 ''I'm sure issuers with auction-rate securities will be following the result of the S.E.C.'s inquiry,'' said Patrick P. Born, chief financial officer for Minneapolis and vice chairman of the Government Finance Officers Association's committee on government debt management. ''Issuers are rightfully concerned about the integrity of the interest rate setting process.''
 Auction-rate debt investors buy a long-term security, like a 30-year bond, and bid through brokers to set the coupon as frequently as weekly or monthly. The risk to sellers is that the brokers and the auctioneer could collude to increase yields beyond what they would be in a blind auction.
 The auction agent and the brokers, working together, may also step in to help investors buy and sell their stakes, which are not backed by a guarantee that a bank will be the buyer of last resort at par value if an auction fails to attract enough buyers.
 The government is looking into whether dealers have special arrangements with investors to buy the securities if the interest rate set at the auction is undesirable or there are not enough bidders.
 Cook County, which includes Chicago, scheduled a sale of a variable-rate security based on a Bond Market Association index after canceling the auction-rate bond sale.

HEADLINE: Trying to Hand Out Life Jackets Over, Under and Around Politics

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 28 

 BODY:
From the moment Congress created it after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, the government board assigned to help bail out the ailing airline industry has found itself in a political caldron.
 It has been courted by companies seeking assistance, besieged by their rivals that want to deny them help, and contacted with regularity by various lawmakers on both sides.
 With its denial on Monday of a loan application from United Airlines, the Air Transportation Stabilization Board moves mainly from issuing financial assistance to monitoring its investments: the $1.56 billion in loan guarantees that it has already provided to six other airlines. 
 But the controversy surrounding its actions is not over. As a result of the United application -- and the administration's decision to give the company an unusual three chances to apply for a loan -- the board is being examined by the inspector general at the Treasury Department to see if it succumbed to any improper political pressure. 
 A lawyer in the inspector general's office suggested Monday that the board's ultimate rejection of the United bid could wind up closing the preliminary inquiry. ''The board's decision is a factor that will be evaluated as we determine where this preliminary inquiry goes,'' said the official, Richard Delmar, counsel to the inspector general.
 Earlier this year, the inspector general opened a separate inquiry examining the relationships between a group of airline executives and the former executive director of the board. That inquiry continues. 
 The industry's healthier airlines, arguing that they could be hurt as their rivals are helped, have repeatedly sought to block loan guarantees. Also at issue are the broader policies surrounding the government's decision to help bail out an industry that many experts say can be restored only through reduced capacity and consolidation. Unlike some other agencies, the board does most of its work in private and does not make public either its contacts with the airlines and lawmakers or the details of its deliberations.
 The views of the Bush administration on particular applications have remained largely behind the scenes, although two of the three board members deciding the fate of the applications are officials from the Treasury and Transportation Departments. (The third member, who is the chairman of the board, is from the Federal Reserve.) 
 The latest political storm over the board's decision making occurred earlier this month, when it voted to deny United's request for $1.6 billion in loan guarantees. One of the three members of the board voted to abstain from the decision, and a few moments after the denial was issued, the Treasury Department, which houses the board, announced that it would permit the airline to revise its application for the second time, even though no other airline had been granted such an opportunity.
 That announcement came after the Treasury Department, which also has a seat on its three-member panel, received calls about the application from House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, Republican of Illinois -- where United's owner, the UAL Corporation, is based -- and from a senior White House official expressing concern over the situation.
 The decision to grant United another chance prompted Senator Peter G. Fitzgerald, Republican of Illinois, to ask the inspector general to review the application, the latest in a long line of criticism from him directed at the board. 
 On Monday, Mr. Fitzgerald praised the board's decision, saying approval of the United application would have ''devastated United's competition.''
 The board's founding was fraught with political turmoil. It was created over the objections of the Bush administration, and ever since it has struggled to identify and complete its delicate mission. It is supposed to help companies crippled by the decline in travel after the attacks but also meet what some have said are conflicting criteria: selecting companies that have a reasonable chance of survival but also have no other access to affordable credit. 
 The board has faced Congressional efforts to reduce its $10 billion program, and in the end it did not use most of the money it was given. It denied nine applications, including United's, and wound up providing guarantees of only about 15 percent of the amount Congress said it could. Its decisions to grant so few of the applications have been criticized by some lawmakers and labor groups, who have argued the board should have done more.
 ''The White House opposed the board from the beginning, and the board has made applications too difficult ever since,'' said Duane E. Woerth, president of the Air Line Pilots Association. The association called the board's decision ''a slap in the face to each United pilot and other employee who worked tirelessly and sacrificed greatly over the past 18 months to secure the company's financial survival.''
 Clifford Winston, an economist and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who has written extensively on the airline industry and the government's role in it, recently concluded a study of the 10 years before the 2001 terrorist attacks. The study, he said, indicated that the most profitable airlines were generally the same ones that provided the greatest benefits to consumers, as measured by fares and flight frequencies.
 ''It shows that the market seems to be effective by itself,'' Mr. Winston said.
 He said that he believed that for policy makers, the decision to create the board was ''a missed opportunity'' to do something more meaningful for consumers and the marketplace, like cutting ticket taxes rather than setting up a new board to help subsidize the industry.
 The creation of the board, he said, ''opened up the politicization of an industry, which is exactly the mind-set we've been trying to get rid of, through deregulation and other policies.''

HEADLINE: Treasuries Slide as Inflation Indicator Exceeds Expectations

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Treasury prices slid yesterday after an inflation measure closely watched by Federal Reserve policy makers proved more robust than analysts had envisioned, leading to a sell-off that later took on a life of its own.
 Investors worry that a continued evidence of a spike in consumer prices could prompt the Federal Reserve to abandon its vow to raise interest rates at a measured pace, forcing it to tighten monetary policy more aggressively.
 The core price index of the consumer spending report rose 0.2 percent in May, or double the 0.1 percent gain that many had anticipated. The core index excludes the prices of food and energy. 
 Inflation is the enemy of bond investors, because it eats away at the steady returns of fixed-income securities. With the job market apparently on the mend, price fluctuations have gained even greater prominence, because they are viewed as the most important factor in any future Fed action. 
 Still, some economists cautioned that the frenzy over price increases overstated the risk of a pervasive or damaging burst of inflation.
 ''Although core inflation has doubled since December 2003, it remains comfortably within the F.O.M.C.'s presumptive 1 percent to 2 percent target range,'' said Steven Wood, chief economist at Insight Economics, referring to the Federal Open Market Committee. ''Moreover, it is still at one of its lowest levels of the past 40 years.''
 Traders feared that the Fed would abandon its commitment to acting gradually if inflation figures were to move much higher. The market is already priced for a quarter-point increase, to 1.25 percent, after the Fed concludes a two-day policy meeting tomorrow.
 The 10-year Treasury note fell 22/32, to a price of 100 4/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.73 percent from 4.64 percent on Friday.
 The price of the 30-year Treasury bond dipped 12/32, to 99 16/32. The bond's yield climbed to 5.41 percent from 5.33 percent on Friday.
 Following are the results of yesterday's auction of three-month and six-month Treasury bills: 

(000 omitted in dollar figures)

	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Price	99.657	99.153	High Rate	1.355	1.675	Investment Rate	1.381	1.713	Low Rate	1.330	1.650	Median Rate	1.350	1.665	Total applied for	$40,004,418	$41,749,892	Accepted	$23,717,743	$20,741,947	Noncompetitive	$1,321,185	$925,470

HEADLINE: Age Of Political Segregation

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS. 
E-mail: dabrooks@nytimes.com

 BODY:
I've been writing about polarization a fair bit recently, and the more I look into it, the more I think I'll just move to Tahiti. That's because the causes of polarization -- at least among elites -- have little to do with passing arguments about the war, the Bush leadership style or the Clinton scandals. The causes are deeper and structural.
 To a large degree, polarization in America is a cultural consequence of the information age. This sort of economy demands and encourages education, and an educated electorate is a polarized electorate. 
 In theory, of course, education is supposed to help us think independently, to weigh evidence and make up our own minds. But that's not how it works in the real world. Highly educated people may call themselves independents, but when it comes to voting they tend to pick a partisan side and stick with it. College-educated voters are more likely than high-school-educated voters to vote for candidates from the same party again and again.
 That's because college-educated voters are more ideological. As the Emory political scientist Alan Abramowitz has shown, a college-educated Democrat is likely to be more liberal than a high-school-educated Democrat, and a college-educated Republican is likely to be more conservative than a high-school-educated Republican. The more you crack the books, the more likely it is you'll shoot off to the right or the left. 
 Once you've joined a side, the information age makes it easier for you to surround yourself with people like yourself. And if there is one thing we have learned over the past generation, it's that we are really into self-validation.
 We don't only want radio programs and Web sites from members of our side -- we want to live near people like ourselves. Information age workers aren't tied down to a mine, a port or a factory. They have more opportunities to shop for a place to live, and they tend to cluster in places where people share their cultural aesthetic and, as it turns out, political values. So every place becomes more like itself, and the cultural divides between places become stark. The information age was supposed to make distance dead, but because of clustering, geography becomes more important. 
 The political result is that Republican places become more Republican and Democratic places become more Democratic.
 Between 1948 and 1976, most counties in the U.S. became more closely divided between Republicans and Democrats. In 1976, Gerald Ford, a Republican, could win most of New England and the entire Pacific coast, and he almost won New York.
 But since then we've been segregating politically. As Bill Bishop of The Austin American-Statesman has found, the number of counties where one party or another has a landslide majority has doubled over the past quarter-century. Whole regions are now solidly Democratic or Republican. Nearly three-quarters of us, according to Bishop, live in counties that are becoming less competitive, and many of us find ourselves living in places that are overwhelmingly liberal or overwhelmingly conservative.
 When we find ourselves in such communities, our views shift even further in the dominant direction. You get this self-reinforcement cycle going, which social scientists call ''group polarization.''
 People lose touch with others in opposing, now distant, camps. And millions of kids are raised in what amount to political ghettoes.
 It's pretty clear that nobody in this election campaign is going to talk much about any of this. This election will apparently be decided on the question of whether it was worth it to go to war in Iraq. That's sucking the air out of every other issue, and inducing the candidates to run orthodox, unimaginative campaigns. 
 Still, it's worth thinking radically. An ambitious national service program would ameliorate the situation. If you had a big but voluntary service program of the sort that Evan Bayh, a Democrat, and John McCain, a Republican, proposed a couple of years ago, millions of young people would find themselves living with different sorts of Americans and spending time in parts of the country they might otherwise know nothing about.
 It might even be worth monkeying with our primary system. The current primaries reward orthodox, polarization-reinforcing candidates. Open, nonpartisan primaries might reward the unorthodox and weaken the party bases. To do nothing is to surrender to a lifetime of ugliness.

HEADLINE: In a Lonely Stand, a Scientist Takes On National Security Dogma

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD

 BODY:
In 2004, a scientist who speaks out against government efforts to thwart terrorism does not win any popularity contests in Washington.
 So Dr. Richard H. Ebright, a molecular biologist with an intimate understanding of the science underlying the use of deadly germs as weapons, has received no warm invitations to participate in federal panels on domestic security.
 Dr. Ebright disagrees with much of the security community about how best to protect the nation from attacks with biological weapons. 
 The government and many security experts say one crucial step is to build more high-security laboratories, where scientists can explore the threats posed not only by deadly natural germs, but also by designer pathogens -- genetically modified superbugs that could outdo natural viruses and bacteria in their killing power. To this end, the Bush administration has earmarked hundreds of millions of dollars to erect such laboratories in Boston; Galveston, Tex.; and Frederick, Md., among other places, increasing eightfold the overall space devoted to the high-technology buildings.
 Dr. Ebright, on the other hand, views the plans as a recipe for catastrophe. The laboratories, called biosafety level 4, or BSL-4, are costly, unnecessary and dangerous, he says.
 ''I'm concerned about them from the standpoint of science, safety, security, public health and economics,'' he added in an interview. ''They lose on all counts.''
 Dr. Ebright has no illusions about the likelihood of biological warfare. ''I think there's a very real threat of bioweapons use,'' he said.
 He closely followed the investigation of the anthrax attacks in 2001 that killed five people and sickened more than a dozen others. Indeed, that investigation veered close to home, when federal agents examined photocopying machines at Rutgers University in Piscataway, N.J., where Dr. Ebright is on the faculty of the Waksman Institute of Microbiology, for possible links to the anthrax mailer.
 But the scientist has voiced his opposition to the government's approach with increasing vigor since the laboratory plans jelled after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, and he has done so with significant authority. Although he is not a military expert, his work on the fundamental biology of microbes gives heft to his views. 
 The labs, Dr. Ebright says, are a perilous overreaction to an inflated threat and will do more harm than good.
 Although the threat of biological warfare is real, the weapons used by terrorists are unlikely to be the next-generation agents that the high-security labs are intended to study, he says. Yet by increasing the availability of such pathogens, Dr. Ebright argues, the labs will ''bring that threat to fruition.''
 ''It's arming our opponents,'' he said.
 In addition, he says, the laboratories could leak. They could put deadly pathogens into irresponsible hands and they will divert money from other worthy endeavors like public health and the frontiers of biology. Moreover, their many hundreds of new employees would become a pool of deadly expertise that could turn malevolent, unleashing lethal germs on an unsuspecting public.
 Dr. Ebright cited a study published in February 2001 that found that of 21 known germ attacks over the decades, most were conducted not by terrorists, but by professional researchers who had gained access to human pathogens.
 ''The substantial majority were research or medical personnel,'' he said, ''which is what you'd expect.''
 He added that the danger of terrorism might well increase during the expansion of BSL-4 laboratories, because they will have to comb an underdeveloped field to hire many hundreds of employees, potentially letting troublemakers slip in.
 Top private and federal experts have lobbied hard for new Level 4 labs as superstar research hubs, arguing that it is only in such highly protected settings that they can study the most dangerous threats and come up with ways to counteract them. The labs boast the highest degree of security, and they are so tightly cut off from the environment that they have been compared to submarines.
 Dr. Richard O. Spertzel, a microbiologist who led the United Nations inspections for germ weapons in Iraq, defended the new laboratories as critical to national security, noting that some would be built on military bases behind barbed wire, adding another layer of protection.
 ''They're absolutely required,'' Dr. Spertzel said. ''Speed is of the essence. We're way behind in protecting ourselves.'' 
 Dr. Ebright said the Level 4 labs appeared to be safe. Their crux is multiple layers of protection to keep lethal germs inside -- technicians in space suits, filters in air ducts, backup generators, negative pressure so any leaks around sealed doors or windows let clean air in rather than poisonous air out and so on.
 But Dr. Ebright noted that the deadly SARS virus recently escaped from BSL-4 and BSL-3 labs in Taiwan, Singapore and Beijing, in each case setting off minor epidemics that killed or sickened people.
 The smart alternative, he says, is for national authorities to focus germ-defense research on more realistic threats like simple anthrax, which needs just a Level 2 or Level 3 laboratory for preparation, while still being powerful enough to knock out whole cities.
 In the end, Dr. Ebright says, it is simple greed, not science or national security, that lies behind some of the Level 4 offensive.
 ''It's the easiest way to bring $100 million to your university,'' he said. ''Perhaps the only way.''

HEADLINE: Brazil's Big Stake in Cotton Likely to Become Bigger

BYLINE: By TODD BENSON

DATELINE: ITUVERAVA, Brazil 

 BODY:
A bet Ronaldo Spirlandelli de Oliveira made six years ago has so far paid off. It may soon pay off even bigger.
 His family's coffee plantation here in this small farming town in southern Brazil desperately needed replanting to keep up production, but with global prices in the gutter it just did not seem worth the effort. So, he planted cotton instead.
 Mr. Oliveira began with just 250 acres of cotton and has been expanding acreage and increasing yields ever since. This season he planted almost 2,000 acres on three plots of land and expects to harvest about 3,200 tons of cotton, bringing in about $1.3 million in revenue. He says he expects to finish 2004 with a profit of about $200,000. 
 That is big money in a poor country like Brazil. But until recently Mr. Oliveira, who is part of a new wave of farmers leading a cotton revival in the country, was wary about increasing his cotton acreage further, fearing that a sudden drop in world prices could spell his ruin. Then came the World Trade Organization ruling in early June that American cotton subsidies violated international trade rules, a landmark decision that could eventually drive up world prices and give cotton growers from Brazil to West Africa an incentive to increase production.
 ''It all depends on prices,'' said Mr. Oliveira, 40, who is also president of the Sao Paulo state cotton growers' association. ''If prices are attractive, people here are going to plant more cotton. And if the United States is forced to get rid of its subsidies, you can bet that prices will go up and you'll see a lot more cotton around here.''
 In its W.T.O. complaint, Brazil contended that the more than $3 billion in annual subsidies paid out to American cotton growers led to increased output in the United States and artificially depressed global prices, robbing Brazil of potential export markets and undercutting the livelihood of its farmers. The subsidies have helped make the United States the world's second-largest cotton producer and the leading cotton exporter, with more than 40 percent of the global market.
 Using data from the United States Department of Agriculture, Brazil argued that American cotton exports would fall 41 percent and production would drop 29 percent if Washington scrapped its subsidies. It also estimated that world cotton prices would rise 12.6 percent, helping farmers in developing countries like Brazil that do not have the benefit of government subsidies.
 The United States has vowed to appeal the W.T.O. decision, saying that the aid programs for American cotton producers are fully consistent with international trade rules. 
 Because the appeals process can drag on for months, maybe years, it is unlikely that Washington will cut cotton subsidies sharply anytime soon. But if Brazil's challenge survives the appeal, Congress could eventually be forced to reduce all agricultural subsidies, which total about $19 billion a year.
 ''This could have implications far broader than cotton,'' said Brink Lindsey, director of the Center for Trade Policy Studies at the libertarian Cato Institute in Washington.
 Without United States cotton subsidies, according to the Brazilian Association of Cotton Producers, Brazil could double its cotton production in just two years. Brazil, South America's largest country, is already on track to harvest a record 1.38 million tons of cotton this season, more than twice as much as it produced five years ago. Exports are booming and could bring in as much as $600 million in 2004, the same amount spent in 2003 to import cotton from abroad, much of it from the United States.
 ''We spent a lot of money to invest in technology and modernize our farms, and it's paying off,'' said Tadashi Mine, 59, who has been cultivating cotton since his family migrated to Brazil from Japan when he was 10 years old. ''But we can't compete with subsidies.''
 ''I'm not saying that we should get subsidies, because we've already proven we can produce without them,'' he said.
 Referring to American cotton farmers, he added, ''All I'm saying is that they have it way too easy.'' 
 Thanks to smart crop management and advances in agricultural technology, Brazil has gone from a net cotton importer to net cotton exporter in less than a decade, recently overtaking Turkey and Uzbekistan to become the world's fifth-largest cotton producer.
 Most of the growth has occurred at huge plantations in the sun-drenched savannas of the country's center-west region as well as in the northeastern state of Bahia, where cotton acreage has doubled every year since 2002 and is now expanding at a faster pace than that of soybeans, Brazil's leading agricultural export. Some traditional cotton-growing regions like this one in Sao Paulo state are also making a comeback, though on a smaller scale since much of the state's landscape is already dominated by vast sugar cane fields and orange groves.
 Perhaps no place better illustrates Brazil's cotton revival than Mato Grosso, a sprawling, sparsely populated state tucked beneath the Amazon rainforest that is drawing farmers in droves from all over the country in search of cheap land and low labor costs. Blessed with soil rich in nutrients and a near-perfect mix of sunshine and rainfall, the state now produces more than half of Brazil's cotton crop, almost all of it harvested on large-scale plantations with American-made machinery.
 ''This is certainly one of the most competitive cotton-producing areas in the world,'' said Gerald Estur of the International Cotton Advisory Committee in Washington, especially since fields in the state -- as in most of Brazil -- are not irrigated. ''We're talking about a region where yields are equivalent to those for irrigated land. That's pretty remarkable.''
 Brazil's cotton boom has put the country at loggerheads with neighboring Argentina, where textile manufacturers complain they are being flooded with cheap cloth made from Brazilian cotton. But Argentina's cotton growers have one advantage over their Brazilian competitors: they can plant genetically modified seeds. That cuts production costs significantly because such crops require half as much pesticide as conventional cotton. Gene-altered crops are still officially banned in Brazil, though the government made an exception this season for soybeans.
 Cotton farmers here say they could increase productivity even more if genetically modified crops were legalized. In a nod to the growing importance of agribusiness for the Brazilian economy, President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, once a vocal critic of genetically engineered crops, has hinted that he now favors legalization. But some influential members of his left-leaning government remain opposed to such a move.
 Cotton growers are becoming tired of waiting.
 ''If the government doesn't legalize transgenic seeds soon,'' said Mauro Itio Takahashi, 50, who grows cotton in the states of Sao Paulo and Minas Gerais, ''a lot of people are going to plant them anyway.''
 Even if Brazil does make the switch to biotech cotton seeds, the country's creaky infrastructure and crowded ports will probably limit its ability to grow as a major exporter in the years ahead. It is also unlikely that the country will stop importing fiber anytime soon, given strong local demand for high-grade pima cotton, which is grown primarily in the southwestern United States.
 ''Brazil's potential to become a big cotton exporter is endless, especially when you consider that we still have an estimated 200 million acres available for planting,'' said Helio Tollini, executive director of the Brazilian Association of Cotton Producers. ''But if we're going to realize that potential, we have to improve our logistics and open new markets abroad first.''

HEADLINE: Dumbo's Fast Switch From Artists' Lofts to Luxury Apartments

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY

 BODY:
On Thursday morning, Karlis Rekevics, a 40-year-old sculptor who works in giant slabs of cast plaster, picked up a sledgehammer and prepared to store his work in the only way he saw possible: in little, tiny pieces. 
 ''I'm a very unprecious artist,'' Mr. Rekevics said, before smashing his multi-ton sculpture to bits. ''And I wanted to go out with a bang.''
 Mr. Rekevics was just one part of a mass exodus of artists who were packing up, breaking down and moving out last week, leaving behind their lives at 70 Washington Street, a hulking 12-story building, between Front and York Streets, in the riverfront Brooklyn neighborhood known as Dumbo (Down Under the Manhattan Bridge Overpass). Beginning in August, the building, a once-vibrant honeycomb of artist studios, galleries, a theater and all manner of artistic enterprise, will be converted into luxury loft apartments, selling for anywhere from $500,000 to more than $1 million. 
 That artists are being displaced by pricey housing shouldn't surprise anyone who has watched over the years as other arty neighborhoods like the East Village, TriBeCa and Williamsburg have been gentrified. But what has shocked many in Dumbo is the extreme speed and calculation with which the neighborhood -- barely residential a decade ago -- has begun to be co-opted by co-ops. (Or condos, to be precise.)
 ''Five years ago, when I first came here, there were no city services, no trash pickup, and it was completely dark and desolate,'' said Adrienne Campbell-Holt, 24, artistic director of the Nest theater space, which closed its doors with a farewell on Saturday. Now, she said, the neighborhood has a sushi restaurant, a West Elm store selling minimalist homewares, and a gourmet chocolatier where a sweet-toothed bohemian can drop $50 for a box of Champagne truffles. (Not to mention $50 for a square foot, the likely rate at 70 Washington.) 
 ''It was all a part of a master plan,'' Ms. Campbell-Holt said. 
 The primary author of that plan, neighborhood residents say, is Two Trees Management, a development company. Two Trees, which owns 70 Washington Street among many other buildings in the area, a collection of brick-faced warehouses and former factories, offered low rents to artists to make the neighborhood more desirable for more affluent professionals, artificially accelerating the age-old cycle of neighborhood renewal in New York City, whereby artists come first as renting homesteaders, and the wealthy follow to buy.
 ''The artists were in Dumbo before we were,'' said Jed Walentas, who runs Two Trees with his father, David C. Walentas. ''The neighborhood obviously had an appeal to artists. Our intent was not to reinvent the neighborhood but to add to its obvious strengths.''
 The artists who filled its bare-bones studios (peeling paint, fluorescent lights, dicey plumbing) at 70 Washington Street knew their days were numbered; the elder Mr. Walentas had long made clear his intention to convert the building and had tailored their leases accordingly. Moreover, many said that they instinctively understood that in New York, where real estate almost always trumps -- just ask the Trumps -- the developers would eventually intrude.
 ''I love the warehouse feel of this space, but we all knew the deal,'' said Angela Milner, an artist who makes what she calls encaustic paintings using wax and a blowtorch. ''Artists are always being pushed out, right?''
 Considering the rent breaks and cheap space they've received, many of those leaving 70 Washington are loath to paint Two Trees as villains; some art groups, in fact, credit Two Trees with helping them relocate in the neighborhood to better-maintained or newly renovated spaces. 
 Smack Mellon, a visual arts group that has been in Dumbo since 1998, is going into a newly rehabbed Two Trees space on Plymouth Street a few blocks away, allowing it to keep a gallery, an artists' workshop and offices under a single roof.
 ''Change is difficult, but we're not really losing out in this situation,'' said Kathleen Gilrain, Smack Mellon's executive director. ''It's the individual artists who will have it harder.''
 One of those individuals is Jack Warren, a 33-year-old painter who moved his studio from a larger space in another trendy neighborhood -- East Williamsburg -- to a smaller one in Dumbo last year. Now he's moving back to Williamsburg to an even smaller space. Other artists talked of heading to Red Hook, Washington Heights or even the South Bronx, where some old piano factories are said to be opening up for artists.
 ''It's the classic scenario of getting dummied into pioneering an area, building a community and having that community usurped into another sort of community that you can't be a part of,'' Mr. Warren said. ''It's just going to be a another sterile rich person's neighborhood.''
 The younger Mr. Walentas disputes that characterization, but does admit that the area is different than it was a decade ago, when his company first began renting space to artists. It began buying property in the area in the early 1980's when it was still largely zoned for industry. 
 ''We actively try to keep them, but at the same time, things change,'' he said. ''The artists that were just paying six bucks a square foot from 10 or 12 years ago, they are not going to stay there. They are going to go to the next neighborhood where they can pay six bucks.''
 That said, there still are plenty of skateboards and trucker caps and four-color tattoos in the environs. Tattooed young men and pierced young women still talk Dada and hang out at the local cafes and bars. And some of the individual artists, including Ms. Milner, are moving out of 70 Washington and into other spaces owned by Two Trees in the neighborhood, albeit at somewhat higher rents.
 But Dumbo's cobblestone streets now show increasing signs of more manicured residential life. ABC Carpet & Home has moved in, as have franchises of popular downtown Manhattan restaurants like Rice, and Bubby's, which is famously child-friendly. A high-end baby shop has emerged, as has a store catering to the apparently well-off parents of pets. 
 And there are doormen at the Sweeney Building, the sold-out 84-unit luxury building on Main Street, and at the the Clock Tower Building across the street, the first Two Trees residential project, which was converted into 124 luxury apartments in 1998.
 The company's biggest project, however, is 70 Washington Street, which will be converted into 225 condominiums ranging in size from 1,200 to 3,000 square feet, according to the company's Dumbo-centric Web site (www.dumbo-newyork.com), and will include amenities like ''state-of-the-art telecommunications and satellite TV, efficient heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems that offer individual control, laundry facilities and gym access.'' 
 Luxury lofts aside, other local artists say they are more concerned that popularity and other forces -- including a proposed improvement district and plans for a high-end mall, called Empire Stores, scheduled to be built on Water Street by Boymelgreen Developers -- might change the neighborhood's character. They even cite the Brooklyn Bridge Park Conservancy, which runs an outdoor film festival that screens summertime movies in Empire-Fulton Ferry State Park, a newly rehabbed green. 
 ''I think I'm more worried about cultural gentrification,'' said Susan Feldman, the artistic director of St. Ann's Warehouse, the Obie-winning company where the likes of Lou Reed and the Wooster Group have performed in recent years. ''What's going to be the nature of the arts down here?''
 Ms. Feldman actually credited the Walentas for picking businesses that worked well with arts groups, including ABC Carpet, which donated furniture for a recent Laurie Anderson concert.
 ''The thing I've always appreciated is the care with which they've picked their tenants,'' she said. ''They've really created a neighborhood.''
 Still, for all the good will, there have been some losses to the arts scene, particularly for performance companies, which require the most room. One well-known avant-garde theater, Gale Gates, et al., closed its 40,000-square-foot space last year and disbanded; the Nest, which had 30,000 square feet and housed 10 small troupes, will continue to foster work, but elsewhere. St. Ann's Warehouse, with 14,000 square feet, remains, but its lease is guaranteed only through 2007. 
 ''We have at least three seasons here,'' Ms. Feldman said, ''but after that, is there going to be a place for us?'' 
 That concern was much more immediate for those vacating 70 Washington last week. All through the building's 12 stories lay mounds of discarded art materials and other detritus: torn canvases and broken computers, piles of plywood and the twisted metal of electrical conduit, art books and power tools. Fliers for moving sales were hung here and there, as were bits of memories; on the third floor, for example, Tom Fruin, a rising young visual artist, pointed out a 30-foot-long mural, painted for his girlfriend. 
 ''She didn't have a view,'' he said, ''so I painted her one.''
 Down the hall, Mr. Rekevics, he of the sledgehammer, was also in a somewhat sentimental mood. He had been in 70 Washington for only three months, but already he'd become attached to the neighborhood.
 ''This building is full of people writing or painting, or architects,'' he said. ''If they leave the neighborhood, will it lose that creative spirit? Will it become a suburb?''

HEADLINE: Consumer Spending Rose 1% In May, Half of That in Prices

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 28 

 BODY:
Consumer spending rose sharply last month with price increases accounting for half the rise, the Commerce Department reported Monday, worrying the bond market in advance of a Federal Reserve interest rate increase expected this week. The price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 22/32 to a price of 100 4/32; its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 4.73 percent from 4.64 percent late Friday.
 Spending was up 1.0 percent in May, surpassing Wall Street forecasts for a 0.8 percent gain and posting the biggest increase since a 2.4 percent rise in October 2001. 
 Consumer spending in April was revised down to 0.2 percent from the 0.3 percent rise originally reported. 
 ''The numbers show that the U.S. economy is doing very well,'' said Peter Frank, senior foreign exchange strategist at ABN Amro, ''and inflationary pressures are slowly building.''
 The Fed is expected to increase short-term interest rates at the end of a two-day meeting that starts on Tuesday from the current low of 1 percent. Fed officials have said that they can tighten monetary policy at a gradual pace, but also want to reassure the markets that they will keep inflation under control.
 The most recent personal income data showed the price index for consumer spending up 0.5 percent after a revised 0.2 percent increase in April. The so-called core index, which excludes food and energy costs, also rose 0.2 percent after a 0.2 percent increase the previous month. 
 ''That suggests that there is still very modest inflation, which is a good sign for the economy,'' said Gary Thayer, chief economist at A.G. Edwards & Sons. 
 ''We're still likely to see the Fed raise rates,'' he said, ''but at a measured pace -- 25 basis points this week and 25 basis points in either August or September.'' (A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.) 
 The move in prices put the year-on-year core inflation reading at a 1.6 percent gain from an upwardly revised 1.6 percent increase in April. This had originally been posted at 1.4 percent, indicating that price pressures have built momentum. 
 Personal income rose 0.6 percent in May, slightly ahead of forecasts for a 0.5 percent rise and matching April's rise. Economists said job growth was finally increasing incomes.

HEADLINE: Surge in Homeless Families Sets Off Debate on Cause

BYLINE: By LESLIE KAUFMAN

DATELINE: ST. CLOUD, Minn. 

 BODY:
In small cities like this one and big ones like Kansas City, Mo., and New York, families are knocking on the doors of homeless shelters in growing numbers. Inside a faded yellow-brick Victorian on a block near downtown here, dozens of families know of the increase firsthand.
 Behind the front door, the 11 rooms of the Landon House Shelter are packed with homeless parents and their children, often exceeding the 48-bed capacity and requiring the staff to roll out cots. In the communal kitchen, someone is always cooking, and the refrigerator has eight different gallons of milk. Children wander in and out screaming for peanut butter and jelly bars and fruit punch boxes. Behind the house is a courtyard where mothers gather to smoke while the children run in circles. 
 ''We are always full,'' said Darlene Johnson, executive director of the shelter. ''Pretty much bursting out of the seams.'' 
 With its rents near record highs and wages stagnant, this wind-swept Plains city of 60,000 about 60 miles northwest of Minneapolis has seen the number of families requesting shelter climb by 45 percent in the last decade, to an average of 124 families a night. The number of homeless families in Minnesota tripled to 1,341 in 2003 a night from 434 in 1991, when the state first started conducting surveys every three years, and most of the last increase came in rural areas like this one.
 And Minnesota is not alone. It is hard to count homeless families, because by their very nature they drift from relatives to shelters to friends' homes. The nationwide count most often cited comes from the Urban Institute, a research group in Washington that surveyed homeless assistance providers in 1996. It found that at least 1.4 million children and 2 million adults were homeless, but that number has surely grown as cities like Columbus, Ohio; Philadelphia; St. Louis; and New York have all reported surges at their homeless shelters for the last two or three years. Some experts on homelessness say the numbers are growing because of the widening gap between low pay and high rents. But others say the federally built homeless shelter system, which helped pay for welcoming surroundings like the Landon House Shelter, has become too attractive for poor families to resist.
 Federal officials, who do not dispute the national growth in homeless families, say both theories appear to have merit. But they say the lack of consensus on the precise cause makes it hard to deal with the increase.
 ''In places where good data is kept, it is clear that the numbers of homeless families are increasing,'' said Phil Mangano, executive director of the White House Interagency Council on Homelessness, the federal agency that coordinates government programs related to the homeless.
 But a lack of hard research, Mr. Mangano said, has prevented the Bush administration from advocating any solution, even as the government has begun efforts to reduce chronic homelessness among single men.
 ''It is an urgent problem,'' he said, ''but we have learned that an ad hoc reaction may make it worse.''
 Family homelessness first emerged as a national problem in the mid-1980's. After a public outcry over the wretched conditions endured by many such families living in crumbling converted hotels, President Ronald Reagan in 1987 signed the McKinney Act, which gave states money to build emergency shelters and help such families.
 In the years since, billions in federal dollars have financed an explosion in the number of such shelters. In 2003 alone, the federal government spent $1.3 billion on more than 3,700 local programs that run shelters. Yet the demand for such beds has hardly slaked. 
 Some liberals have expressed concern that these shelters have done little more than hide a shameful epidemic from public view, while conservatives have argued that they have become an expensive magnet for poor families who are unhappy with their living situations and are seeking government help. Yet, almost everyone agrees that the number of families knocking on their doors continues to swell.
 Homeless families are traditionally difficult to count, but in 2001 Congress ordered the Department of Housing and Urban Development to try. While the agency does not expect to have a nationwide count until 2007, for now it relies on data from 10 cities and states, including Minnesota, St. Louis, Boston, New York, Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia. 
 Among this group only one city, Spokane, Wash., had not experienced an increase in the number of families seeking shelter since 2000.Other cities not on HUD's list are also reporting increased family homelessness, including Charlotte, N.C.; Bridgeport, Conn.; and Denver.
 But if the trend is clear, its cause is the source of hot debate. 
 Many academics and advocates for the homeless cite a widening gulf between income and rents. Real pay for the bottom 10 percent of wage earners rose less than 1 percent in adjusted dollars from 1979 to 2003, according to the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal research group based in Washington. Welfare payments buy less than half of what they did in 1970, and millions of families no longer receive them at all.
 By contrast, housing costs have nearly tripled since 1979, pushed up in part by stricter building codes and slum-removal programs. Meanwhile, city governments have been steadily eliminating public housing.
 In the greater Minneapolis-St. Paul area, the gap between wages and rent has been widened by the recent recession. Average rents in St. Cloud and seven surrounding counties rose to $860 a month in 2000 from $670 a month in 1994, while the vacancy rate declined to less than 2 percent from 4 percent, according to the Wilder Research Center, a nonpartisan organization that conducts a survey of the homeless for the state every three years.
 ''Most of the vacancies are at the high end of the market, where landlords have to compete for customers with the credit records to buy,'' said Rod Johnson, the Wilder center's housing researcher. ''And even though panicked landlords will cut deals like one month's free rent, they don't cut base rents often.''
 The hunt for cheap housing is what consumes many residents of the Landon shelter, who say rents are not the only barrier.
 Kiwanja Dotson came to St. Cloud from Chicago in 2002 with her husband and six children when they lost her home there. Although her husband has worked steadily as a cook for $1,500 a month, the only landlord willing to rent to her family charged $1,000 a month for a home with a crumbly roof and moldy walls, conditions that eventually led to a lawsuit, an eviction and a scarred credit record.
 Ms. Dotson has been on the telephone every day since the family left its last house in January, but because the couple has six children and sued their previous landlord, few owners are willing to take a risk on them.
 If tight rental markets tell part of the story, they are clearly not the whole story. Since the 1980's, a significant body of research has developed to show that the heads of homeless families, like their single, street-sleeping male counterparts, are often drug addicts or mentally impaired or both.
 The families are also disproportionately African-American and usually headed by unwed mothers or women fleeing domestic violence.
 The Wilder center estimates that 61 percent of the heads of homeless families in Minnesota have at least one significant mental illness, chronic illness or substance abuse problem. 
 ''You can't try and pretend they are just like you and me,'' said Ellen Shelton, a research scientist with the center. ''Some are just down on their luck, but it is not the majority.''
 Critics of the shelter system argue that it may be abetting personal dysfunction. The shelter system constructed with federal dollars after the McKinney Act was a vast improvement over the shoddy hotels of the 1980's. Many programs, particularly in New York, place families in the shelter at the top of the list for government subsidized rental apartments, an incentive that New York is considering dropping.
 Such a system actually encourages families to enter the shelter system, argues Howard Husock, who teaches at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, particularly those who are doubled up with relatives or living in otherwise uncomfortable situations because of personal choices, including unwed motherhood.
 Until recently, Lela Jackson, 39, an unmarried mother of five, lived in a one-bedroom public housing unit in Chicago and worked from 4 p.m. to 1 a.m. as a security guard. Then her youngest son started getting into trouble. ''Neighbors would stop me and tell me he was throwing eggs at their cars,'' Ms. Jackson said. 
 She decided to move out of the projects. ''I refuse to let him be lost to the streets,'' she said of the son.
 Her sister, who had already moved to Minnesota for the schools and lower rents, told Ms. Jackson about the Ramsey County Family Services Center, a newly built family shelter across from the municipal golf course in a suburb of St. Paul. Complete with a computer room, cheery cafeteria and immaculate apartments, it seemed like just the place to start a new life. 
 So two months ago, Ms. Jackson quit her job in Chicago to move with her three younger children into the shelter in Minnesota, after a brief stay with her sister. ''My plan was to come here and get housed,'' she said. 
 Mr. Mangano, the Bush administration's homelessness chief, said most families did not enter the shelter system unless they had exhausted every other option. Still, he said the emergency shelter system that Washington had built might have been a misuse of money.
 ''If we had an opportunity to go back, we might have created a different response on homeless, one that focused more on investing in housing,'' he said. ''We spent billions of dollars and have had 20 years of shuffling homeless people from one side of town to the other, from one homeless program to another. It is a disgrace.''

HEADLINE: Who Lost Iraq?

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN. 
E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
The formal occupation of Iraq came to an ignominious end yesterday with a furtive ceremony, held two days early to foil insurgent attacks, and a swift airborne exit for the chief administrator. In reality, the occupation will continue under another name, most likely until a hostile Iraqi populace demands that we leave. But it's already worth asking why things went so wrong. 
 The Iraq venture may have been doomed from the start -- but we'll never know for sure because the Bush administration made such a mess of the occupation. Future historians will view it as a case study of how not to run a country. 
 Up to a point, the numbers in the Brookings Institution's invaluable Iraq Index tell the tale. Figures on the electricity supply and oil production show a pattern of fitful recovery and frequent reversals; figures on insurgent attacks and civilian casualties show a security situation that got progressively worse, not better; public opinion polls show an occupation that squandered the initial good will.
 What the figures don't describe is the toxic mix of ideological obsession and cronyism that lie behind that dismal performance.
 The insurgency took root during the occupation's first few months, when the Coalition Provisional Authority seemed oddly disengaged from the problems of postwar anarchy. But what was Paul Bremer III, the head of the C.P.A., focused on? According to a Washington Post reporter who shared a flight with him last June, ''Bremer discussed the need to privatize government-run factories with such fervor that his voice cut through the din of the cargo hold.''
 Plans for privatization were eventually put on hold. But as he prepared to leave Iraq, Mr. Bremer listed reduced tax rates, reduced tariffs and the liberalization of foreign-investment laws as among his major accomplishments. Insurgents are blowing up pipelines and police stations, geysers of sewage are erupting from the streets, and the electricity is off most of the time -- but we've given Iraq the gift of supply-side economics.
 If the occupiers often seemed oblivious to reality, one reason was that many jobs at the C.P.A. went to people whose qualifications seemed to lie mainly in their personal and political connections -- people like Simone Ledeen, whose father, Michael Ledeen, a prominent neoconservative, told a forum that ''the level of casualties is secondary'' because ''we are a warlike people'' and ''we love war.''
 Still, given Mr. Bremer's economic focus, you might at least have expected his top aide for private-sector development to be an expert on privatization and liberalization in such countries as Russia or Argentina. But the job initially went to Thomas Foley, a Connecticut businessman and Republican fund-raiser with no obviously relevant expertise. In March, Michael Fleischer, a New Jersey businessman, took over. Yes, he's Ari Fleischer's brother. Mr. Fleischer told The Chicago Tribune that part of his job was educating Iraqi businessmen: ''The only paradigm they know is cronyism. We are teaching them that there is an alternative system with built-in checks and built-in review.''
 Checks and review? Yesterday a leading British charity, Christian Aid, released a scathing report, ''Fueling Suspicion,'' on the use of Iraqi oil revenue. It points out that the May 2003 U.N. resolution giving the C.P.A. the right to spend that revenue required the creation of an international oversight board, which would appoint an auditor to ensure that the funds were spent to benefit the Iraqi people. 
 Instead, the U.S. stalled, and the auditor didn't begin work until April 2004. Even then, according to an interim report, it faced ''resistance from C.P.A. staff.'' And now, with the audit still unpublished, the C.P.A. has been dissolved.
 Defenders of the administration will no doubt say that Christian Aid and other critics have no proof that the unaccounted-for billions were ill spent. But think of it this way: given the Arab world's suspicion that we came to steal Iraq's oil, the occupation authorities had every incentive to expedite an independent audit that would clear Halliburton and other U.S. corporations of charges that they were profiteering at Iraq's expense. Unless, that is, the charges are true.
 Let's say the obvious. By making Iraq a playground for right-wing economic theorists, an employment agency for friends and family, and a source of lucrative contracts for corporate donors, the administration did terrorist recruiters a very big favor.

AIRPORT CAPACITY STRAINS -- Mainly because of a return of robust business travel and the growth of low-fare carriers, 9 of the 35 top airports in the United States are operating above their passenger levels before Sept. 11, 2001, and 6 more will exceed pre-9/11 passenger levels by the end of the year, said Marion C. Blakey, the administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration. Over a longer term, more runways and other facilities are needed, the United States Department of Transportation reported last week. The agency said the report is the first to evaluate in detail air travel patterns and economic and population projections against current service and capacity at domestic airports. According to the study, 15 airports will need to add capacity to accommodate growth over the next decade. The list includes Metropolitan Oakland International; Bob Hope in Burbank, Calif.; Long Beach; John Wayne-Orange County; Tucson International; Albuquerque International; San Antonio International; Houston Hobby; O'Hare International; LaGuardia; Kennedy International; Newark Liberty International; Philadelphia International; Palm Beach International and Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International.

PRIVATE SCREENERS REDUX -- An 18-month test program at five airports to evaluate the benefits of allowing domestic airports to again use private companies, rather than federal employees, for passenger and baggage screening has been declared a success by the Department of Homeland Security. The agency issued guidelines last week for any airport interested in replacing federal screeners with private ones. The agency said that the test program had shown that security and customer service at the five participating airports was ''comparable to airports staffed with federal screeners.'' Airports wanting to replace federal employees with private ones for security screening can submit applications starting Nov. 19.

SECURITY AND PRIVACY -- Corporate travel managers are increasingly uneasy about the way the federal government is putting in place plans with airlines for a passenger screening system that will register and classify travelers based on perceived risks. So far, at least half a dozen airlines have been identified as sharing passenger personal records with the federal government as new passenger prescreening and registered-traveler programs are developed. The corporate travel managers trade association has previously said its main concerns were that mistakes in using detailed personal information from a range of data banks could cause delays and added costs to business travelers mistakenly identified as questionable or unacceptable risks. Nancy Holtzman, the group's executive director, expressed misgivings about the secretive procedures. The group said it was working with the International Association of Privacy Professionals to define and evaluate the overlap of corporate travel policies and data-privacy issues.

CHEWING GUM RETURNS TO SINGAPORE -- It is now possible to sell some kinds of chewing gum in Singapore -- but only in pharmacies, and only to those who register with the government first. Famously fastidious Singapore outlawed gum in 1992 because it fouled sidewalks and other public places. In relaxing the ban, the Singapore government said it was allowing the sale of 19 brands of chewing gum sold for ''medicinal'' and ''dental'' uses. JOE SHARKEY

HEADLINE: Oil Prices Hit Two-Month Low After Early Power Transfer in Iraq

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Crude oil futures hit a two-month low in New York after the American-led occupation authority handed sovereignty to Iraq two days ahead of schedule, tempering concern that terrorists would disrupt the country's petroleum operations. 
 The transfer, which was scheduled for Wednesday, was brought forward at the request of Iraq's prime minister, Iyad Allawi, ''who was ready to take control and put his policies into force,'' a coalition spokeswoman said. The transfer may reduce the prospect that terrorists would try to sabotage pipelines or terminals. 
 ''The big news is the transfer of power,'' said Peter Beutel, president of Cameron Hanover Inc., an energy consultant in New Canaan, Conn. 
 ''We've taken away a couple key days where these terrorists could really have halted the transfer,'' Mr. Beutel said. ''This at least is a psychological victory for the forces of stability in Iraq.'' 
 Crude oil for August delivery fell $1.31, or 3.5 percent, to $36.24 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the lowest closing price for a contract closest to expiration since $35.73 on April 21. Oil has fallen 14 percent from a record close of $42.33 on June 1. 
 Iraq, which holds the world's second-largest oil reserves according to BP, has suffered almost daily attacks against security forces or oil infrastructure, including sabotage to pipelines that halted exports earlier this month. 
 Iraq restored exports through Persian Gulf terminals on Saturday. In Norway, Statoil and ConocoPhillips said oil production returned to normal after the government halted a strike on Friday that cut more than 10 percent of output from the third-largest exporter of crude. 
 ''Norwegian fields are operating normally and OPEC is increasing its exports as much as promised,'' said Rob Laughlin, a trader with GNI Ltd. in London. ''This is shown not only by words, but also by facts, looking at ship chartering.'' 
 Oil exports through Iraq's Basra and Khor al Amaya terminals returned to about 1.68 million barrels a day after pipeline repairs were completed, Moayd Hashim, the harbor master at the Basra oil terminal, said Saturday. 
 Exports were halted on June 15 after attacks on two pipelines that supply the terminals. About 800,000 barrels a day of oil began flowing last week after completion of repairs to one pipeline. 
 United States crude reserves have risen to the highest level since August 2002 as Canada, Mexico and other exporters stepped up shipments, signaling that refiners in the United States should have ample stock to keep pace with summer demand. 
 Inventories gained 2.5 million barrels during the week ended June 18 to 305.4 million barrels, up 7.5 percent from a year earlier, the Energy Department said.

HEADLINE: Victims of Olympics Bombing Win Right to Sue Organizers

BYLINE: By ARIEL HART

DATELINE: ATLANTA, June 28 

 BODY:
The Georgia Supreme Court ruled unanimously Monday that victims of a bombing during a late-night concert at the 1996 Olympic Games may sue the Games' organizers.
 ''It's the best news I've had in seven years,'' said John Hawthorne, 55, whose wife, Alice, died in the blast. ''We finally got our way cleared to put it in front of a jury instead of a judge.'' 
 The Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games had said that it was immune to the suit, which charges lax security, under a 1965 state law that protects those who provide land for public recreation. Victims of the bombing at Centennial Olympic Park, which killed Ms. Hawthorne and injured more than 100 others, argued that the park's use was commercial, not recreational. The court said that was a matter for a jury to decide.
 A lawyer for the committee said that money made in the park was not part of a commercial enterprise but to pay for the park's construction and the recreation there. A lawyer for the victims disagreed.
 The Atlanta Games' organizers tried to pay for them completely with private money. Streets turned into bazaars, and at a promotional village in the park sponsors like Coca-Cola, Swatch and AT&T promoted their brands and sold wares and souvenirs. 
 The ruling provided some consolation for the organizers. Disagreeing with an appeals court, the Supreme Court said that in deciding whether the park was being used for recreational or commercial purposes, the jury may consider ''the social and economic aspects of the park'' even after the Olympics. That includes the fact that the park was turned over to the state, said a lawyer for the committee, Ryan Mock. The park is now an open plaza where the downtown lunch crowd strolls red brick paths with a fountain for a backdrop, and day and evening concerts are held.
 Mr. Mock said ''obviously there's some frustration on our part'' that the court left the recreation question in the hands of a jury, but said ''we look forward to presenting that issue to the jury at trial.''
 A lawyer who argued the victims' case, James Sadd, said they had not requested a specific dollar amount but would seek enough to compensate them for medical costs, lost wages and suffering. He said that the committee had $100 million in insurance.
 Mr. Sadd noted that more than 20 minutes had elapsed between the discovery of the backpack containing the bomb and the explosion. He said that security officers should have cleared people farther away from it, and that they should have restricted entry to the park with metal detectors and bag searches.
 The suit also names Eric R. Rudolph, who was indicted in the bombing in 2000, and captured last year.
 Mr. Sadd said that the trial judge, Charles L. Carnes of Fulton County State Court, whose original ruling for the Olympic organizers was overturned, would hold a hearing to set a time frame for the case.
 ''And as far as we're concerned,'' Mr. Sadd said, ''the trial can't happen soon enough.''

HEADLINE: WATSON PHARMACEUTICALS CUTS QUARTERLY FORECAST 

BYLINE: Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc., a maker of birth control pills and urology products, cut its second-quarter sales and profit estimates and said it planned to lay off half of its sales force. Earnings will fall to 31 cents to 33 cents a share on revenue of $400 million, $10 million less than previously forecast, the company said. Excluding one-time items, the company expects a profit of 39 cents to 41 cents a share, down from its prior forecast of 50 cents to 52 cents a share. Net income was 47 cents in the year-earlier period. Watson, based in Corona, Calif., plans to eliminate 300 of its 600 sales jobs as it reorganizes to focus on urology, kidney disease and generic drugs. Contraceptive purchases fell short of forecasts because of increased competition. Watson will close a factory in Miami and end a contract sales-force agreement with Ventiv Health Inc., helping save $80 million to $90 million a year, the company said.

HEADLINE: Parting Words From Bremer, Acceptance From Allawi and Congratulations From Bush

 BODY:
Following is the text of L. Paul Bremer III's farewell letter to members of the Coalition Provisional Authority: 
 The Coalition Provisional Authority ceases to exist today. I would like to extend my personal thanks to everyone who works and has worked at the Coalition Provisional Authority, its predecessor, the Office of Refugee and Humanitarian Assistance, and to the fine men and women who have served in the coalition forces. Both groups have served with courage in the face of huge risks. Many have paid the ultimate price. We owe them a debt of gratitude, which no words can express.
 Each of you has participated in a process unique in history. A coalition of the willing came together and toppled a tyrant. Then, civilian volunteers from around the world came to try not only to repair the ravages of war but to reconstruct a country devastated by over three decades of misrule.
 You have contributed to replacing the tyranny of one man with a broadly representative government pledged to uphold the rights of all.
 You have contributed to rebuilding Iraq and modernizing its economy.
 You have contributed to making a better life for the citizens of this wonderful country.
 These are noble undertakings for which I am deeply grateful.
 I thank you for your sacrifice and your service and wish each of you the very best in the coming years.
 Following are excerpts from the speech given by Iyad Allawi, the prime minister of Iraq, in Baghdad yesterday, at the transition to formal sovereignty, as translated by the Federal Document Clearing House Inc., a private transcription service. A full transcript is online at nytimes.com/world.
 Dear Free People: Our dear Iraq is now at a setback, but it is a very temporary setback, and we will rise up after that like mountains, standing up very firm. And we will protect all the people regardless of religion, color or any other consideration, so every Iraqi will have the right to their unified, united Iraq, where brotherhood and justice prevail. And a national unity and tolerance and brotherly behavior and spirit of peace and prosperity will prevail. 
 Changing this to reality is a matter that will take our fullest consideration and dedication. This will be our agenda, and that will prevail over all of Iraq. The national unity, Dear Brothers, Dear Free Brothers, is a sacred issue. And the pluralism of national origin, religion and others should be a factor of progression, not divisiveness.
 It is time that we helped each other and cooperated. We listen to the opinion and the other opinion, and we live according to Islamic values and the message of our prophet when he said all Muslims are equal like the teeth of the comb. 
 Please let us not be afraid of those outlaws that are fighting Islam and Muslims, because God is with us. Those are the grandsons of the heretics of Islam; they were rejected by history. . . .
 Our government will work in a clear agenda that has priorities to tackle the serious matters first and put in place linchpins for progression on the economic infrastructure so that the returns to the Iraqi people will be quick; the financial returns will be good. And we will study the privatization and consider their returns to promote investment. And here I call all the countries of the world to participate in supporting Iraq and rebuilding Iraq. . . . 
 Following is the text of the letter from President Bush given to Iyad Allawi by L. Paul Bremer III yesterday, and Dr. Allawi's response, as published on the White House Web site: www.whitehouse.gov.
 Dear Mr. Prime Minister:
 Congratulations on your recent appointment and to the Iraqi people on the great strides that have been made in the past year toward freedom and democracy in Iraq. The United States is a committed partner in this endeavor, and it is my honor to propose the establishment of diplomatic relations between the United States and Iraq with permanent missions, effective immediately upon the assumption of sovereign authority by the Iraqi Interim Government.
 The United States reiterates its commitment to support your government as it leads Iraq toward national elections. I look forward to your response confirming the establishment of diplomatic relations between our two countries and to pursuing our shared vision for Iraq's journey to freedom. Sincerely, GEORGE W. BUSH

Dear President Bush,
 I have received your letter of June 27, 2004, and have the honor of confirming the establishment of diplomatic relations with full diplomatic mission between Iraq and the United States. Sincerely, IYAD ALLAWI

HEADLINE: A Plan Passes And an Arena Is Protested In Brooklyn

BYLINE: By DIANE CARDWELL

 BODY:
The City Council took a major step in remaking Downtown Brooklyn yesterday, formally approving an ambitious rezoning package that is intended to encourage commercial and residential development as part of the city's efforts to attract and keep jobs within the five boroughs.
 ''This plan will go a long way toward creating a vibrant downtown in Brooklyn and ensuring New York City's competitiveness for many years to come,'' Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said in a statement. ''We will now focus our energies on attracting companies to Downtown Brooklyn and developing the sites, both commercial and residential, covered in this effort.''
 The plan, which passed by a vote of 47 to 0 with one abstention and covers an area roughly bounded by Flatbush Avenue and Tillary, Adams and Schermerhorn Streets, could create 4.5 million square feet of new office and commercial space and 1,000 apartments, as well as a new park on top of a garage at Willoughby Street. 
 ''The purpose of this plan is to help New York City compete with New Jersey, Westchester, Connecticut for high-paying office jobs,'' tens of thousands of which the city lost to those areas during the last economic boom, Councilman David Yassky said in voting to approve the package. ''This plan will help us keep those jobs in the next boom.''
 Still, some elements of the plan that had touched off community opposition, including the potential demolition of buildings that may have been stops on the Underground Railroad and an expected shortage of parking for residents, remain unresolved. Council members said they planned to hold hearings to consider designating the buildings that were possibly used by runaway slaves as landmarks, while Mr. Yassky, who represents the area, said the city had agreed to a number of steps to open more parking spaces to residents, including, perhaps, a residential permit program.
 Similar concerns about overdevelopment in the area surfaced yesterday when a group opposed to a neighboring development project, one that would bring a Nets arena and 17 commercial and residential towers to an area sweeping west from the Atlantic Avenue railyards, released a report concluding that the plan could cost city and state taxpayers up to $506 million. ''Make no mistake, this project will be using taxpayer money -- loads of it,'' Gustav Peebles, a postdoctoral fellow at Columbia University and a co-writer of the report, said at a news conference announcing the findings.
 The report was written largely in response to an economic analysis commissioned by Forest City Ratner, the Atlantic Yards developer. That report concluded that the project would bring about $800 million in net revenue for the city and state. The money would come in part from tax revenues associated with the arena, increasingly valuable real estate and spending by new residents and office workers.
 But the report by Dr. Peebles, an anthropologist who studies economic issues, argues that the Forest City Ratner report, written by Andrew Zimbalist, an economist who analyzes the sports industry, makes several faulty assumptions, including overstating the need for new office space, inflating the projected income levels of potential residents and workers and ignoring the effect of a long-term construction project on property values. The new report, written with Jung Kim, an urban planner with a master's degree from the London School of Economics, concludes that the project is not worth the public investment the developer is seeking.
 ''In other states and localities, developers pay impact fees out of their own revenues to cover the social costs arising from their projects,'' the report says. ''Here in New York, the payment is in reverse, with taxpayers handing over hundreds of millions to wealthy developers.''
 Barry Baum, a spokesman for Forest City Ratner (which is The New York Times Company's partner in developing its new headquarters on Eighth Avenue in Manhattan), said company officials had not yet fully reviewed the report and could not comment on the details. ''However,'' he added, ''Andrew Zimbalist is a respected economist who has not in the past generally supported this kind of project, but clearly sees a great benefit for the city and state from the Atlantic Yards arena and development.''
 Dr. Zimbalist, for his part, said he had not seen the report and knew only what he had heard from reporters. Saying he was unsure whether Dr. Peebles or Mr. Kim had fully understood the economic issues, he added, ''I was very careful in my use of numbers.''

HEADLINE: Liberals Hold Onto Power In Close Election in Canada

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

DATELINE: TORONTO, June 28 

 BODY:
Prime Minister Paul Martin and his Liberal Party survived a strong Conservative challenge on Monday to retain power, but they lost their majority in the House of Commons after the most rancorous election campaign in nearly a generation.
 Stephen Harper, the Conservative Party leader who called for tax cuts and more military spending, hoped to begin a sea change in Canadian politics, but his campaign stalled in its final days. Urban voters feared that his victory could jeopardize social programs and bring to power social conservatives who opposed abortion and gay rights.
 With ballots counted in most of the country, Liberals led or defeated the Conservatives in the races in 136 districts to 94. The separatist Bloc Quebecois was winning in 55 districts, followed by the labor-aligned New Democratic party in 22. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation projected that a Liberal minority government would take power, the first minority government since 1979. 
 There have been many minority governments in Canadian history, but they tend to be short-lived. The Liberals can be expected to lean on the New Democrats, a party that is suspicious of free trade and is highly critical of United States foreign policy, to pass critical legislation. The three previous Liberal governments since 1993 won lopsided majorities in Parliament.
 With unemployment falling and separatist tensions in Quebec mostly dormant, no single issue dominated the campaign. But Mr. Martin, 65, was hobbled by a series of Liberal Party scandals that produced a strong popular backlash. His unbending campaign to force Jean Chretien to resign in December and to then take over the ruling party left many raw wounds, while two conservative parties managed to compete as a unified force.
 Through much of the campaign, Mr. Martin appeared tired and unfocused.
 Just before he set the election date last month, he visited President Bush at the White House and declared his intention to work more closely with Washington.
 But when he returned home, he implicity criticized the United States by suggesting that Mr. Harper would make Canada more like its southern neighbor, with lower taxes and inadequate health care for the poor. Mr. Martin was also shaken by a recent tax increase by the Liberal provincial government in Ontario, the country's most populous province, only months after the party ran on a platform promising no new taxes.
 In the end, Mr. Martin settled on the theme that the Liberals were the natural defenders of ''Canadian values,'' like publicly financed health insurance and support for the Kyoto climate control accord. He pledged to install a nationwide child day care program.
 ''We really think this is the time for all progressives to come together,'' Mr. Martin told reporters at a campaign stop in Nova Scotia on Sunday, in a pitch to win back voters from the New Democratic Party and the Bloc Quebecois.
 Mr. Harper, a 45-year-old former economics graduate student who has been representing Calgary, set up his run by skillfully uniting the Canadian Alliance Party with the more centrist Progressive Conservative Party last October to form the new Conservative Party, and then running a moderate campaign.
 While he pledged to abandon gun registry regulations, which are unpopular in the west, and to cut income taxes and to return more control to provincial governments, he managed to steer clear of pronouncing controversial views on gay rights and abortion. But the campaign was hobbled by local Conservative candidates who stated views on gay marriage and other issues that frightened young voters and women, particularly in urban areas.
 Mr. Harper tried to ride a wave of dissatisfaction with the Liberals. ''We are going to change the system, we are going to make things better, we are going to clean up the mess,'' Mr. Harper told a rally in Edmonton on Sunday.
 The defining point of contention for many voters was a scandal involving the disbursement by the government of about $75 million to Quebec advertising firms friendly to the Liberal Party as part of an antiseparatist campaign. The country's auditor general released a report soon after Mr. Martin took power, saying that the firms did little or nothing for the money, and the opposition said it was all a kickback scheme to line the the Liberals' campaign war chest.
 Mr. Martin insisted that he knew nothing of the payoffs even though he was finance minister at the time, and that he intended to reengineer Liberal rule to make it more accountable and democratic. But he called the election before a final investigation could be completed, provoking a good deal of popular cynicism, especially in his home province of Quebec, and the Bloc Quebecois surged as a protest vehicle.
 ''Outside Quebec, the scandal was all about pandering to Quebecers and wasting money on Quebec,'' said Antonia Maioni, director of the McGill University Institute for the Study of Canada. ''And inside Quebec, it confirmed to Quebecers that the Liberal Party was corrupt and trying to buy Quebecers.''
 Political scientists do not see the wilting of Liberal support as a fundamental shift in the country's political orientation. Polls were extremely volatile, and there were indications that a large number of voters did not decide how to vote until the last minute.
 A Leger Marketing poll of more than 1,000 people released Sunday indicated that nearly one in four voters in Quebec, the second most populous province, said they could change their minds about who to vote for on election day.
 The fickleness of the voters was at least in part a measure of the failure of the two major leaders to define themselves and offer a compelling message.
 ''Martin wants us to believe he is the Liberal Party Gorbachev, but people don't believe it,'' said Michel C. Auger, a columnist for La Journal de Montreal. ''Harper said you shouldn't elect these guys, but he didn't say why people should vote for him. He couldn't quite close the sale.''

HEADLINE: Pentagon Brass and Military Contractors' Gold

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE

 BODY:
Edward C. Aldridge's storied career exemplifies the dizzying spins of the revolving door between the Pentagon and its military contractors. He has been secretary of the Air Force, president of the McDonnell Douglas Corporation and, most recently, an under secretary of defense. 
 Now, he is a member of the Lockheed Martin Corporation board, a detail that did not prevent him from being named to head President Bush's commission on space exploration. Lockheed is one of NASA's biggest contractors, and only Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, objected and called for Mr. Aldridge's removal, complaining of conflict of interest. 
 But Mr. Aldridge, who receives $155,000 a year from Lockheed and owns $115,000 in company stock, stayed put. Last month, the commission called for privatizing much of NASA. One of the biggest potential beneficiaries is United Space Alliance, a Lockheed company that operates the space shuttle and does more business with NASA than any other contractor. 
 Mr. Aldridge brushes off criticism of his roles, saying that his actions are in compliance with current ethics laws. 
 ''It doesn't bother me, and I don't give it any credibility,'' he said in a telephone interview. ''The space commission's agenda is for the next 50 years. We didn't get into any issues on who will be bidding on contracts down the road. We just want to create vision for success and what is right for NASA.''
 For years, the revolving door between the Pentagon and military contractors has spun without much notice in Washington. But the multiple roles played by top Pentagon and government officials, like Mr. Aldridge, who have joined the ranks of military contractors as executives, board members and lobbyists, are now coming under closer scrutiny after a top Air Force official negotiated a lucrative job contract with the Boeing Company while still overseeing Boeing business. This is not the first time Mr. Aldridge's actions have raised eyebrows. Last year, in the month before he left the Pentagon for Lockheed's board, Mr. Aldridge approved a $3 billion contract to build 20 Lockheed F/A-22's, after having long criticized the program as overpriced and having threatened to cancel it. 
 While the number of people who make such transitions is not tracked by the government, the Project on Government Oversight, a Washington nonprofit group that studies military spending, will issue a report today showing that 288 top government officials since 1997 have taken positions at the 20 largest military contractors at levels high enough that they were disclosed in federal regulatory filings. 
 The infusion at such companies as Lockheed, Boeing, Northrop Grumman and Raytheon makes it difficult ''to determine where the government stops and the private sector begins,'' the report states. 
 On Capitol Hill, Senator McCain, who heads the Senate Commerce Committee, will hold Congressional hearings soon on the Pentagon's revolving door, the first on the subject in nearly a dozen years. Senator Robert C. Byrd, Democrat of West Virginia, tried to insert a provision into the 2005 Pentagon spending bill last week to tighten ethics laws, but his effort was beaten back by stiff opposition.
 ''The potential for abuse is enormous.'' said Senator Byrd, who added that the relationship between military contractors and the Pentagon is ''too close, too chummy.''
 Under current law, government officials who make contracting decisions must either wait a year before joining a military contractor or, if they want to switch immediately, must start in an affiliate or division unrelated to their government work. One big loophole is that these restrictions do not apply to many high-level policy makers, like Mr. Aldridge, who can join corporations or their boards without waiting.
 Senator Byrd's proposal would have extended the waiting period to two years, and made it apply to many policy makers like Mr. Aldridge. The proposal would also have eliminated the provision exempting government employees from the waiting period if their new jobs were in a division unrelated to their government work. 
 Even the Bush administration, which has been criticized for its close ties to corporate America, is siding with some of the critics. Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld has called for the Pentagon general counsel's office to look into the rules and regulations governing negotiations between top-level government officials and the military contractors who might want to hire them.
 The White House issued an executive order this year making it more difficult for senior administration officials seeking employment with government contractors to get waivers exempting them from many of the ethics rules as they negotiated their post-government jobs. 
 ''The president is committed to the highest standards of ethical conduct, including avoiding financial conflicts of interest,'' said Andrew H. Card, White House chief of staff, who drafted the executive order. ''Compliance with the highest standards in connection with negotiations for post-government employment'' is a ''particularly important aspect'' of a civil servant's duties, Mr. Card said.
 The study from the Project on Government Oversight is the most comprehensive on the subject, and a comparison with previous years is difficult. But, Danielle Brian, executive director of the project, said that at the Pentagon, ''It's a given that the second half of one's career will be in industry, and it wasn't always that way.
 ''We don't want our government filled with people who are using their government positions as a steppingstone to making money in the private sector,'' she said. ''Yet this issue has been off everyone's radar screen for so long, it's turning into the normal protocol with military contractors.''
 The steady march along the Potomac from the Pentagon to military contractors has its defenders. Steven Kelman, a professor at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, said the revolving door enabled hard-working government employees to accept low wages, if they knew there was a future benefit. Moreover, Mr. Kelman said, the large number of Pentagon officials working at military contractors infuses those companies with a sense of public purpose. 
 ''Given the lower salaries in government for senior people,'' said Mr. Kelman, who also works for the Accenture Corporation as a lobbyist promoting closer links between business and government, ''if you prevented them from having careers after they left government in the area where they worked, it would be harder to recruit and retain civil servants.'' 
 Like baseball teams vying for superstars, top military contractors can each boast of their generals, admirals and Pentagon civilian brass. For instance, Lockheed lays claim to Gen. Joseph W. Ralston, former vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Boeing has Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who is a member of the boards of other military contractors, including United Defense Industries and L-3 Communications. Boeing also has Rudy F. deLeon, former deputy secretary of defense. 
 Over at Northrop, there is Gen. John T. Chain, a retired commander of the Strategic Air Command, while General Dynamics has Paul Kaminski, a former defense under secretary, and former Lt. Gen. David K. Heebner, who was an Army assistant vice chief of staff. 
 To some, this is all for the better.
 ''Personally, I'm offended by the criticism,'' said Thomas Jurkowsky, a Lockheed spokesman and a former rear admiral and chief of naval information. ''I interpret it as someone questioning my integrity. At Lockheed, there are ethics policies and rules in place, and certainly they are more than sufficient. People know what is right and what is wrong.''
 The swiftness of the opposition to Senator Byrd's efforts shows how hard it will be for him to tighten existing rules -- even as he vows to press on. 
 ''We don't want to make people unemployable in whole industries,'' said Alan Chvotkin, general counsel of the Professional Services Council, a trade group representing government contractors. 
 Moreover, the revolving door does not just go in one direction, adding another potential area of conflict. 
 When he took office, Mr. Rumsfeld made clear his preference for corporate expertise in the Pentagon and named executives from military contractors as heads of the three services: James Roche, the secretary of the Air Force, is a former vice president of Northrop Grumman; Gordon England, the secretary of the Navy, is a former executive at General Dynamics; and Thomas P. White, a former secretary of the Army, came from Enron. 
 It was the first time in recent memory that heads of all three services came directly from government contractors.
 A study by the World Policy Institute, a nonprofit research group at the New School University, found that the Bush administration, in its first year and a half, named 32 appointees who were former executives, paid consultants or major shareholders of top military contractors to top policy-making positions.
 William Hartung, author of the study, said a rough comparison showed this exceeded the number of industry-related appointees in either the Clinton administration or the administration of the first President Bush. 
 ''There's a danger when you have too many folks from the corporate world advising you,'' Mr. Hartung said. ''It can lead to inbred decision making that is pro-corporate and anti-taxpayer.''
 Two members of the influential Defense Policy Board, a quasi-governmental board that advises Mr. Rumsfeld on military strategy, were hired by Boeing as consultants while it was seeking Pentagon approval for a $20 billion contract for aerial refueling tankers. 
 An internal Boeing e-mail message indicated that the men, Adm. David Jeremiah, a retired vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and a member of five corporate boards, and Gen. Ronald Fogleman, who retired from the Air Force, were to lobby Mr. Rumsfeld's office. 
 General Fogleman, in an interview, confirmed he was a Boeing consultant, but said he never contacted anyone at the Pentagon on the company's behalf. Still, he did endorse portions of the Boeing tanker plan at a variety of public events. Admiral Jeremiah declined to comment. 
 Finally, there is Mr. Aldridge. On joining the Lockheed Board, Mr. Aldridge was immediately named by Mr. Rumsfeld to a blue-ribbon panel studying how the Pentagon should buy weapons -- including those made by Lockheed, which has received $142 billion in government contracts in the last seven years. 
 For nearly a decade, Mr. Aldridge, who prefers to be called Pete, was also a member of the Defense Science Board, another influential group that advises Mr. Rumsfeld on military strategy and whose members are privy to classified information. 
 Mr. Aldridge recently left the Defense Science Board because it posed a conflict with his role as a director of Global Crossing. Recently, a majority stake in Global Crossing, a telecommunications company emerging from bankruptcy, was acquired by Singapore Telecommunications, which is controlled by the Singapore government.
 In fact, Mr. Aldridge's presence at Global Crossing eased government concerns about the sale of the company -- and its critical telecommunications networks -- to a foreign buyer. 
 The Singapore deal, which will bring $100 million to Global Crossing, received Justice Department approval last year after Mr. Aldridge agreed to sit on a special Global Crossing committee to monitor United States security concerns and to give up his work on the Defense Science Board, a powerful but nonpaying seat.
 ''When I wanted to leave the Pentagon, I first went to the lawyers to see if there were any restrictions, and I had none,'' said Mr. Aldridge, explaining these moves. Besides, multibillion-dollar military contracts are reviewed by so many people at the Pentagon that ''there is no way to be so blatant and show favoritism,'' he said.

HEADLINE: City Announces Financing Deal for Mitchell-Lama Landlords

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN; Jennifer Steinhauer contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
In a move praised by landlords, tenants and housing groups, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and city housing officials announced a complicated new financing plan yesterday offering more incentives for property owners to stay in the Mitchell-Lama program, which provides housing for tens of thousands of low- and moderate-income families in the city.
 The plan, a two-part initiative that would refinance existing mortgages on Mitchell-Lama properties and offer $50 million in loans for capital improvements, would be aimed at protecting 27,000 apartments in 80 buildings in all five boroughs. If the owners of those 80 buildings decide not to leave the program for 15 years -- as city officials hope -- then the cost to the city and the Housing Development Corporation would be $75.5 million.
 ''We believe this is a sensible, low-cost investment that would preserve affordable homes for tens of thousands of New Yorkers for the next 15 to 30 years,'' Mr. Bloomberg said at a news conference at City Hall. 
 Under the Mitchell-Lama program, developers receive subsidies and tax breaks, usually for 20 years or more, in exchange for building housing for low- and moderate-income families. But in recent years, a growing number of developers have left the program after fulfilling their mortgage obligations, and have begun to charge market rates for apartments.
 Overall, about 21,000 of the original 140,000 apartments in dozens of buildings have been removed from Mitchell-Lama since the program started half a century ago, according to a report in February by the city comptroller, William C. Thompson Jr. At the same time, a growing number of tenant groups have made the loss of Mitchell-Lama units one of their top legislative concerns -- something that has not escaped the notice of officials including Gifford Miller, the City Council speaker, and Mr. Bloomberg.
 In March, for instance, the city helped to broker a deal between the tenants and owner of the Independence Plaza North housing development in TriBeCa to protect tenants from escalating rents once the development leaves the Mitchell-Lama program this year.
 But yesterday's initiative is broader. It affects 80 rental and co-op buildings -- 36 in Manhattan, 26 in the Bronx, 11 in Brooklyn, 7 in Queens and one in Staten Island. And it will offer these Mitchell-Lama developments the opportunity to restructure and refinance their mortgages at a lower interest rate and for an extended duration.
 In so doing, city officials said, the program will help owners reduce their operating costs and use those savings on repairs. So to provide low-cost financing, the city is offering loans of $1 million to $7 million per complex, for a total of $50 million, under a new Repair Loan Program.
 "We think owners are interested in this because this is a very effective way for them to actually do refinancing," said Emily Youssouf, president of the Housing Development Corporation.
 What makes the program even more compelling, perhaps, is that just about anyone involved in housing issues in New York put aside the usual differences to applaud the effort. Representatives from the Real Estate Board of New York, the Rent Stabilization Association and the Mitchell Lama Residents Coalition all praised the program in a city press release.
 It remains to be seen just how many owners will go along with the program. It is certainly possible, for instance, that some owners will buy out of their Mitchell-Lama obligations no matter what the city offers, because their buildings are in such prime locations and would command soaring rents.
 Still, many tenant groups said that the new program could make a significant difference.
 "We think it's a good program, and we support it," said Michael McKee, associate director of Tenants and Neighbors, a statewide advocacy group. "There's a lot more that needs to be done, but it's an encouraging step forward. Very creative."

HEADLINE: U.S. TRANSFERS POWER TO IRAQ 2 DAYS EARLY

BYLINE: By DEXTER FILKINS; Ian Fisher and Ashley Gilbertson contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, June 28 

 BODY:
Fifteen months after Saddam Hussein was swept from power, American authorities turned over formal sovereignty of this restive country to Iraq's new leaders on Monday in a surprise ceremony called two days ahead of schedule.
 American aides and Iraqi officials said they had moved up the date of the ceremony, and held it in near secrecy, to foil the timing of any terrorist attacks that might be in the works. After more than a week's discussion, the decision was made only on Sunday, an American official said, after Iyad Allawi, the new Iraqi prime minister, indicated he was prepared to take charge.
 But even now, it is unclear how much control his government will exercise, particularly over the 160,000 troops from the United States, Britain and other countries that will remain here, or even over Iraq's own army and police forces.
 At 10:26 a.m., L. Paul Bremer III, the chief American civilian official here, restored formal sovereignty to Iraq in a simple meeting deep inside the heavily fortified area known as the Green Zone. 
 Standing at the foot of a gilded sofa left behind by Mr. Hussein, Mr. Bremer handed Dr. Allawi a leather-bound note from President Bush, indicating that the Coalition Provisional Authority led by Mr. Bremer since last May was dissolved.
 At a ceremony later, Dr. Allawi celebrated his accession by promising that ''a national unity and tolerance and brotherly behavior and spirit of peace and prosperity will prevail.'' [Transcript, Page A10.]
 Mr. Bremer, in his remarks, harkened back to the crimes of Mr. Hussein, saying, ''Anybody who has any doubt about whether Iraq is a better place today than it was 14 months ago should go down to see the mass graves in Hilla,'' a site that holds thousands of victims of Mr. Hussein's rule. ''Anybody who has seen those things that I have will know that Iraq is a much better place.'' 
 With that, Mr. Bremer flew by helicopter to Baghdad International Airport, boarded an American C-130 military transport and left the country. The entire ceremony, witnessed by no more than a few dozen people, lasted less than 30 minutes. 
 Hours later, the new American ambassador here, John D. Negroponte, arrived, re-establishing American diplomatic ties with Iraq for the first time since Mr. Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990. 
 With more than 850 American servicemen and women dead 15 months after he ordered the invasion, Mr. Bush said the transfer of formal sovereignty would undercut the insurgents' hopes of rallying the Iraqi people. 
 ''After decades of brutal rule by a terror regime, the Iraqi people have their country back,'' Mr. Bush said in Istanbul at a gathering of NATO leaders, who agreed Monday to help rebuild Iraq's security forces. ''The terrorists are doing all they can to stop the rise of a free Iraq, but their bombs and attacks have not prevented Iraqi sovereignty, and they will not prevent Iraqi democracy.'' 
 Following the formal transfer of sovereignty, Dr. Allawi and Sheik Ghazi Ajil al-Yawar, the new Iraqi president, and other members of the new government took the oath of office before a slightly larger audience. 
 Under the terms of the United Nations Security Resolution declaring the occupation ended, Sheik Yawar and his colleagues regained full control over their country, its people and borders. But for all the assurances on Monday, they are still largely dependent on the United States and other countries for their solvency and security in the face of a guerrilla insurgency.
 Even with Mr. Bremer's departure and the dissolution of the Coalition Provisional Authority, the American government and Mr. Negroponte will retain enormous influence here, staffing an embassy that the Americans say will be the world's largest and controlling the distribution of more than $8 billion in reconstruction aid. 
 The symbols of a new order were in evidence at the Green Zone. The swearing-in ceremony was conducted entirely in Arabic, with reporters and diplomats receiving wireless earsets that piped in an English translation. A bright Iraqi flag flew over the sprawling compound for the first time, fluttering under a laser-like sun. 
 Yet American soldiers still stood guard, with their light tanks pointing their turrets into the chaotic Baghdad traffic. Overhead, Apache gunships swooped and circled, bristling with missiles and guns. 
 By its own design, the new Iraqi leadership that took over Monday has limited itself to modest ambitions, forswearing any treaties or domestic initiatives beyond defeating the insurgency and preparing for the country's first nationwide elections, scheduled to take place no later than Jan. 31, 2005. 
 Sensing those limits, Iraqis greeted the return of their country's sovereignty with measured optimism. When word of the ceremony began trickling out, few Iraqis engaged in the celebratory gunfire and whooping cheers that typify the festivities that follow a victory by the Iraqi national football team, or that marked the capture Mr. Hussein last December. 
 Some Iraqis expressed hope that the chaos of the past 15 months would begin to subside, and that the country's new democratic institutions, implanted by a Western army, might be given a chance to work. 
 ''There is only one thing we are looking for now -- an elected government in the future,'' said Kamal Mohammed, a shopkeeper in the Sunni-dominated neighborhood of Ghazaliya. ''Even a 100-mile journey starts with a first step.''
 Dr. Allawi, the former Baath Party member and a leading opponent of Mr. Hussein, made no mention on Monday of some of the harsher measures he and his colleagues have been contemplating to help crush the insurgency. 
 In recent days, Dr. Allawi has said that the new Iraqi government may impose some form of emergency rule, which could immediately restrict the Western-style freedoms enshrined in the constitution that Iraqi leaders drafted at great effort earlier this year. 
 Dr. Allawi said nothing of postponing the elections, a suggestion he made last week, or of offering amnesty to guerrilla fighters in exchange for their laying down arms. 
 Even so, Dr. Allawi, who is known to be a secular man, used the occasion of his inauguration to turn the rhetorical tables on his enemies, who often try to frame their campaign as a fight for the glory of Islam. 
 ''I hope this despotic, infidel group that is fighting against Islam and Muslims will not scare us, because God and truth are with us,'' he said. 
 Then Dr. Allawi gave the insurgents a stern warning, in a way that has already earned him a measure of popularity among many ordinary Iraqis who have grown tired of the violence. 
 ''I warn the forces of terror once again,'' Dr. Allawi said. ''We will not forget who stood with us and against us in our national crisis.'' 
 ''I say that we, with God's will and the support of our people, will be ready for them, that we will hunt them down to face justice and give them their just punishment.'' 
 The decision by Mr. Bush to transfer formal sovereignty this month was made in November, following a spate of bloody attacks on American soldiers. It was then that American officials concluded that their own presence in the country, and the continued military occupation, was becoming increasingly unpopular among Iraqis. 
 Even the Americans' staunchest Iraqi supporters here conceded that the military occupation had alienated many Iraqis. 
 ''The occupation was a learning experience for both countries,'' said Nasreen Barwari, the Harvard-trained minister of public of works. 
 American officials said they did not decide until Sunday to move up the transfer of formal sovereignty by two days. They said discussions had begun last week, following the transfer of all the government ministries back into Iraqi hands. 
 One senior American official in Baghdad said the idea had been pushed by Dr. Allawi, who has asserted himself forcefully since being selected as prime minister in a process led by the United Nations earlier this month. 
 A senior American official here, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that as late as Monday morning, only six of Mr. Bremer's closest aides knew of the decision to accelerate the transfer. 
 The decision, and the speed with which events moved, seemed to thwart any attempt to disrupt the end-of-occupation ceremony. American military officials had warned journalists last week to expect great violence in the coming days, especially on June 30. There was ample precedent: earlier this month, the ceremony unveiling the new interim government was shelled and attacked by a car bomber. 
 But on Monday, Baghdad and much of the country was unusually quiet. ''I am sure many of their attacks have been foiled,'' said Hamid al-Kifajay, the government's spokesman. 
 At Camp Ferrin-Huggins in southern Baghdad, Sgt. Jason Barton of the First Cavalry Division said he found out about the event late in the morning, long after many Iraqis in the neighborhood. 
 ''Well, we just came out in sector about an hour ago, and the people looked at us like, 'Why are you still here?' '' Sergeant Barton said. ''They are a little friendlier now that Iraq is theirs.''

HEADLINE: For Sorely Put-Upon Traveler, a Summer of Vexation

BYLINE: By AMY ZIPKIN

 BODY:
With the economy booming and the skies becoming ever more crowded as the tourist season approaches, business travelers are preparing themselves for a long hot summer. And for certain destinations, the outlook is particularly grim.
 The four-mile freeway tie-up by mourners in Southern California, on their way this month to pay their respects to Ronald Reagan at his presidential library, may have been a harbinger of things to come in Boston during the Democratic convention from July 26 to July 29 and in New York during the Republican convention from Aug. 30 to Sept. 2. 
 Each has been designated as a national security event, and each can be expected to produce closed or congested streets, overbooked hotels and restaurants, rowdy demonstrations and an overwhelming police presence.
 The conventions will be bookends for the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, where emergency measures will be in place to cope with the crush of people. 
 For business travelers headed to the West Coast, the wildfires that caused so much havoc in 2003 started this year in California three weeks earlier, on May 3.
 Lower on the list of hazards is the chance of another power blackout in the Northeast or Midwest. The airline industry's continuing struggles, notably United Airlines' failed effort for a government loan guarantee to ease its path out of bankruptcy protection, are also throwing a shadow over business travel. And, some say, hanging over all other considerations is the threat of a terrorist attack before the November elections.
 Boston expects 35,000 delegates and guests for the Democratic convention, swelling the usual summer horde of tourists and business visitors. On the Friday before convention week, officials predict, the number of arrivals at Logan airport will surge by 18,000 above the typical level of 87,000 or so. Most of the 20,000 hotel rooms in the Boston-Cambridge area were booked long ago by the Democratic National Convention Committee. 
 When those that remain run out, local officials say, some visitors will be seeking accommodations at bed-and-breakfasts as far away as Cape Cod, 90 minutes to the south.
 For Bostonians, there will be disruptions too. North Station, a mass-transit center and commuter train terminal, will be shut down on July 23 for a week. Interstate 93, a north-south artery, will close each afternoon and evening while the convention is in session. 
 City officials are asking businesses to give employees time off or to let them work at home that week, a request that is being widely ignored.
 Brian Zepf, a vice president at City Express, a courier service that employs 72 foot and bicycle messengers and 200 drivers, says he will show up in the office by 4 a.m., rather than the usual 8 a.m. or 9 a.m., to make sure that everything runs smoothly.
 ''We're not letting anyone take the week off,'' he said.
 Jane Koopman, director of marketing for MaidPro, a cleaning company with offices in 20 states, says she cannot afford to scale back her time in the office because her company is adding four franchises that week. For her, the coming political show is a headache, with her commuting time likely to double to nearly two hours each way, she says.
 New York expects an influx of tens of thousands of convention visitors, and some businesses have decided that the best way to deal with the crowds is to flee them. 
 Gerald Cohen, president of Information Builders, a software company, says he has already thrown in the towel. Information Builders is at 2 Penn Plaza, atop Madison Square Garden where the Republican convention will be held, and even in ordinary times, getting to work can be vexing.
 ''I don't know how you'll get past the crowds to go through the police lines into the building,'' Mr. Cohen said. ''It's going to be a madhouse.'' He has advised his 800 employees to take vacation time and says the company can get by with a skeletal staff of 25. 
 ''I'm leading by example; I'm getting out of town,'' said Mr. Cohen, who plans to take yoga classes, get massages and work out at the Canyon Ranch resort in Lenox, Mass.
 Barry Shapiro, a manager of accounting and auditing services at Amper, Politziner & Mattia, 12 blocks north of Mr. Cohen, is escaping to Virginia. 
 ''It has nothing to do with danger,'' said Mr. Shapiro, who made the decision after reading news accounts of possible street closings and dogs sniffing for bombs on trains coming into Penn Station next to Madison Square Garden. ''It's simply not worth the hassle this city will be that week.'' 
 How intense will security become in New York? Jimmy Chin, regional director of risk management for Peninsula Hotels North America and chairman of the safety and security committee of the Hotel Association of New York City, says that even the Republican delegates, who will be staying at more than 40 hotels scattered around Manhattan, will get a healthy taste of it. 
 ''As dignitaries enter or leave, frozen zones could extend to hotels,'' he said, referring to police bans on vehicle or pedestrian traffic in specified areas.
 In summertime Athens, security will be tight though the restrictions will affect mostly tourists. Like many other Europeans in August, Athenians go on vacation, said Nicholas Larigakis, executive director of the American Hellenic Institute, a trade group in Washington, and ''no business gets conducted.''
 Still, iJet Travel Risk Management, a security consulting firm in Annapolis, Md., is advising business clients going to Greece before the Olympics to expect tie-ups in Athens. In a report distributed in May, the company wrote that transportation would be unreliable, ''plagued by delays from ongoing building projects and security drills.'' 
 iJet says visitors should hire a car and driver and expect searches in many buildings.
 Another region with potential trouble for business travelers is California, with its annual wildfires that are often at their worst in September and October. Last fall, the conflagrations forced a two-day evacuation of a Federal Aviation Administration air-traffic facility in San Diego and the cancellation of flights at California airports including Los Angeles International, Burbank, Long Beach, John Wayne in Orange County, San Diego International and Ontario. 
 No one is predicting a repeat of last August's blackout from Ohio to New Jersey, but no one is ruling it out either, especially if a long humid spell grips the Northeast and Midwest. 
 Carol Murphy, spokeswoman for the New York Independent System Operator, notes that human error was a big reason for the system's failure, and says that some measures that could reduce its vulnerability, like tree trimming around electrical wires, are still left to the discretion of local utilities.
 Michael Landy is not letting painful memories of last year's blackout deter him from traveling. Mr. Landy, chief technology officer of Comprehensive Software Systems in Golden, Colo., and a frequent traveler to New York, had to evacuate the New York Marriott Financial Center hotel and spend the night on a park bench at Battery Park City. 
 The next day, when airline personnel at LaGuardia Airport required confirmation of his flight reservation, he used wireless technology to ask his home office to send it to his laptop computer. Now, he says, he never travels without a wireless connection.
 The worst menace on many people's minds is terrorism. ''Both conventions are prime targets,'' said Howard Safir, a former New York City police commissioner and now chief executive of SafirRosetti, a security consulting firm in Manhattan.
 While the country remains on yellow alert, he says, New York maintains the next higher level, orange alert. Mr. Safir predicts that business travelers will encounter an increase in random screenings.
 ''I'd give myself plenty of time,'' he said. ''I'd do my business and move on.''

HEADLINE: Looking Beyond His Critics, Bremer Sees Reason for Both Hope and Caution

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, June 28 

 BODY:
For the 414 days that he was America's proconsul in Iraq, L. Paul Bremer III was forever reacting to surprises sprung by others, often deeply jarring or violent ones, for America, Iraq and Mr. Bremer. On Monday, there was a surprise of a different kind, and it allowed Mr. Bremer to end America's formal occupation of Iraq in a way that pre-empted the insurgents who have thrown into doubt everything he came here to achieve.
 Until the last moments, the 48-hour advance of Iraq's return to formal sovereignty -- requested by Prime Minister Iyad Allawi and approved by President Bush -- was known in Baghdad to only a small group of senior Iraqis and to the most trusted of Mr. Bremer's American aides. Mr. Allawi's aim of forestalling insurgent attacks to disrupt the transition -- which American military intelligence had warned of in recent days -- was successful, and set the stage for a relatively quiet day at the start of Iraq's newfound sovereignty. 
 Mr. Bremer, 63, was far from a household name in May 2003 when President Bush picked him for the most powerful post any American has held abroad since Gen. Douglas MacArthur's postwar years in Japan. His low-key manner was broken notably, in December, when he vaulted into the American press center here and stunned the world with his opening words, ''Ladies and gentlemen, we got him!'' -- announcing the capture of Saddam Hussein. 
 On Monday, Mr. Bremer, Brooks Brothers smart as always, still matching his suit to the desert boots that became his trademark here, allowed himself a smile of satisfaction as he handed Iraqi officials the blue leather-bound folio containing legal documents affirming the transition. ''It's a great pleasure to be here this day to formally hand over sovereignty on behalf of the coalition,'' he said, cursory as ever at the moment when his plenipotentiary powers slipped away. 
 That said, he boarded a Black Hawk helicopter to begin his journey out of Iraq, and eventually to his house in Vermont, teaching the gourmet cooking classes that are his favorite pastime, and the book on his Iraq experiences that he plans to write. Although he broke a habit of months in his last days here by giving a series of interviews to American reporters, his discretion, to the last, meant that Americans wanting to know his innermost thoughts on his tenure here will probably have to wait for the book. 
 In the interviews, including two meetings with The New York Times late last week, Mr. Bremer seemed intent on bolstering the flagging confidence of many here and in the United States that the American enterprise can recover from the blows of the insurgency and lead to the creation of a stable, democratically governed Iraq. That has been his mantra through the months that the war has worsened. 
 But for all his professed belief that matters will get better now that Iraq is governed by Iraqis again, an undercurrent of caution and uncertainty showed through at several points in the interview. ''Of course,'' he said at one point, ''the future, as Yogi Berra might have said, is hard to know.'' 
 Ironically, considering the criticism directed at Mr. Bremer for his decree last May disbanding Mr. Hussein's 400,000-man army, Mr. Bremer returned repeatedly to Iraq's critical need to build up its own armed forces. It is an undertaking that gained fresh urgency with mutinies and desertions involving one of the first battalions of the new army, many regional police forces and elements of the newly formed Iraqi Civil Defense Force under the challenge of the uprisings that exploded in April in Falluja and several cities across southern Iraq.
 ''I think we'll win the war, and we'll win it as we get more and more Iraqis standing up and fighting, and as we proceed on the second pillar, which is getting an Iraqi government,'' Mr. Bremer said. But later in the interview, asked whether he thought the American military commitment here could end with a Vietnam-like withdrawal, he replied: ''You can certainly draw any kind of scenarios you want. I think it will all depend on what happens with security.''
 As if sensing that he had ventured too close to doubt, he added, ''But as I said earlier, I am optimistic that they can manage this and get through the next year and a half to a more representative government.'' Then he switched again, to a more modulated view. ''But you can certainly write scenarios that take it in a different direction,'' he said. ''There are a lot of strains in this society; Iraq is surrounded by unfriendly neighbors, at least two or three of which don't want us to succeed. And the worldwide fight against terrorism has a major battlefield here.'' 
 For now, nobody can know what will become of the fragile Iraqi political structures Mr. Bremer has left behind. At best, the interim government of appointed leaders that took over on Monday will be a first step toward a series of elections next year leading to a permanent constitution, and a five-year, elected parliament and government by January 2006. If the plan holds up, the new Iraq of which Mr. Bremer was a principal architect could go down in history as an extraordinary achievement. 
 But at worst, things could descend into one of the doomsday scenarios feared by Iraqis, and by Americans who worry about the safety of nearly 140,000 United States troops and 25,000 others from more than 30 allied nations who will remain here as guarantors: a new dictatorship, the rise of a militantly Islamic Shiite government, or worse yet, a civil war. 
 One certain thing is that historians will weigh in on Mr. Bremer's stewardship, and on that score, his record seems, on balance, unlikely to win the sort of endorsements that have enveloped General MacArthur's legacy in Japan. 
 The general, of course, did not have an insurgency to contend with as he oversaw Japan's transition to democracy. For Mr. Bremer, the deaths of more than 850 American soldiers and thousands of Iraqi civilians, and the impediment that the violence posed to the $18.6 billion reconstruction voted by Congress last fall, bedeviled everything that America sought to accomplish here. On Monday, the constant chance of violence hung like a dark cloud over the transition ceremony, even if the timing confounded the insurgents for a day. 
 Notably, though, Mr. Bremer left Iraq with wide respect among ordinary Iraqis -- no small thing, given that a recent poll by an Iraqi newspaper found that more than 80 percent of Iraqis condemned the occupation. There has been admiration for his courage in venturing outside the occupation headquarters in Baghdad's so-called Green Zone, facing the ever-present risk of assassination. 
 ''I'm really upset about this,'' said Anaam Abdul Wahed, 35, having lunch with her niece in a Baghdad restaurant, when she learned Mr. Bremer had gone, in hastened circumstances that denied him even a broadcast farewell. ''He has become our friend. He's really kind, and handsome. We didn't look at him as we look at Iraqi officials.''
 But neither Mr. Bremer's personal popularity, nor the fact that his stewardship was beset by war, may win him a break in history. Before he left, an aide described him as feeling like ''a punching bag'' for the criticisms he has taken from some quarters in Washington for the many reversals of the occupation, especially after the jubilant welcome given to American troops as they captured Baghdad.
 At the White House, at the State Department, which he served as a diplomat for 23 years, and at the Pentagon, where Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld had appointed him chief administrator for Iraq -- as well as among American field commanders frustrated by the disbanding of the Iraqi army and resentful of what they regarded as Mr. Bremer's interference in the conduct of the war -- he became less favored as his time here wore on.
 Mr. Bremer's frustration at those shadowy assaults showed only obliquely in the interview, when he alluded to his strong personal relationship with Mr. Bush, who appears to have remained his backer even as others in the White House began looking for a scapegoat. ''I've always been amazed -- it's an interesting phenomenon, and I've talked to the president about it -- how good the view is from the back of a car,'' Mr. Bremer said. Then he added, smiling, ''Particularly looking backwards.'' 
 Mr. Bremer's most controversial decision was the one to disband the old army, a move reportedly determined during discussions with another high-ranking Pentagon official on the plane to Baghdad in May 2003. As the war worsened last autumn and winter, he described the decision as an affirmation of reality, recognizing that the army had disintegrated during the American invasion and that the soldiers would not have responded to a summons to regroup.
 The decision was coupled with an order excluding thousands of officials from returning to their government jobs if they held a senior rank in Mr. Hussein's Baath party, a ruling Mr. Bremer began to think too harsh by the end of last year, but officially relaxed only this spring. Together, those decisions left the occupation without the backbone that might have come from an effective Iraqi military force and experienced Iraqi administrators.
 In effect, America and its allies, along with a few hundred returned Iraqi exiles, found themselves largely alone in tackling the daunting task of rebuilding a country the size of France, with a population of 25 million people, that had been devastated by three wars under Mr. Hussein, 13 years of United Nations economic sanctions and 35 years of government neglect.
 When Mr. Bremer was asked in the interview whether there was anything the United States might have done better, he skirted the issue but in a way that suggested that the entire American undertaking here was based on naive assumptions about the magnitude of the postwar challenge, or at least a failure to prepare for it adequately. ''People have said the prewar planning was no good,'' he said. ''I don't know. I was a businessman until 10 days before I pitched up here, so I don't know.'' 
 Looking back, Mr. Bremer liked to remind his critics what he inherited when he arrived, succeeding a brief-lived predecessor, Gen. Jay Garner, who was fired by Mr. Rumsfeld after less than a month on the job. ''Baghdad was on fire, literally, as I drove in from the airport,'' he said when he summed up the occupation's progress last March, a year after the invasion. ''There was no traffic on the streets; there was no electricity anywhere; no oil production; no economic activity; there wasn't a single policeman on duty anywhere.''
 In his farewell interviews, he ticked off the achievements that have offset the miseries Iraqis have endured from the insurgency: 100,000 policemen back on duty; electricity flows, on the best days, at the highest levels Iraq has ever recorded; oil production back to prewar levels, before insurgents sabotaged key pipelines; unemployment down, by occupation authority estimates, to about 20 percent nationwide, against 60 percent in the invasion's aftermath. 
 If Mr. Bush and the invasion's planners in Washington had rose-colored expectations of how the American takeover would be received, Iraqis, Mr. Bremer suggested in his interview, had similarly unrealistic hopes about America. 
 ''The attitude was, 'You guys put a man on the moon, and threw out a regime that we couldn't touch for 35 years in three weeks, so why was the electricity not fixed in three weeks?' '' Mr. Bremer said. 
 Mr. Bremer said he did not think America's prospects were as badly damaged as many Americans may have assumed by disclosures about the abuse of Iraqi detainees at Abu Ghraib prison. ''In my conversations with Iraqis, though they disliked it intensely,'' they contrasted the American crackdown on misbehavior with the days of Saddam Hussein when, he said, ''this kind of behavior was a policy, was not talked about, and was certainly never punished.''
 At the conclusion of the interview, Mr. Bremer offered what amounted to his own epitaph for the occupation. ''You can make all these criticisms of what has happened here; no doubt we made mistakes,'' he said. ''But Iraq is unarguably a better place today than it was before we came here, and people who are critical have to be able to answer the question, 'Would it have been better if we had simply left Saddam in power?' 
 ''And I'll tell you, you won't find more than 2 percent of all Iraqis, for all their complaints they're making now, who think it would have been better if we had never come.''

HEADLINE: Wary Iraqis Face Changes With Silence And Hope

BYLINE: By EDWARD WONG and IAN FISHER; Jeffrey Gettleman contributed reporting from Baghdad for this article, and Iraqi employees of The New York Times from Mosul and Najaf.

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, June 28 

 BODY:
When news came that the American occupation forces here had transferred formal sovereignty to a new Iraqi government, the sweltering streets of the capital did not resound Monday with the celebratory crackle of automatic gunfire, as they did on the December afternoon when the Americans announced that Saddam Hussein had been captured.
 Nor did people flood the avenues to parade the Iraqi flag.
 American tanks and Humvees still rumbled through the boulevards. Concertina wire and concrete walls still blocked roadways. Iraqis were still barred from large swaths of the capital, including the fortified American sector called the Green Zone. 
 Perhaps nothing indicated the wariness Iraqis felt more than the silence that greeted the surprise announcement of the occupation's formal end. Across the country, Iraqis embraced the fact the United States had taken a step back from ruling their nation, but they also realized that the Americans would continue to wield heavy influence for some time to come.
 ''Our leaders are just toys,'' said Ashjan al-Akuli, an employee in a cramped computer store in Baghdad's Jamaa neighborhood. ''They have independent thought, but they don't have independent action, which is the most important thing.''
 ''Bremer has left, but the strings attached to the new government are very long,'' she said, referring to L. Paul Bremer III, the top American administrator in Iraq, who flew out of the country around noon. ''They can be pulled from Washington.''
 She turned to the storeowner, Ahmed al-Ansary.
 ''I hope it's good,'' said Mr. Ansary, who is 28. ''But if the Americans stay here, nothing will change. They need to pull out of the cities. We don't want to see their Humvees around.''
 Ismael Saddam, a 32-year-old taxi driver, glared at a tank and a Humvee rolling past a long line of cars waiting to refuel at a gas station. Despite the ovenlike heat and the aggravation of waiting 70 minutes in line, he said a sense of national pride had been rekindled in his heart.
 ''It's for sure I feel that,'' he said. ''You know, by our nature we reject occupation. So we accept an Iraqi ruler. It's much better than the occupiers.''
 That sentiment was echoed by people in the northern city of Mosul, which has seen a number of attacks by insurgents on American soldiers and Iraqi policemen.
 ''By God's will, the new Iraqi government will stabilize the country,'' said Muhammad Tahir, a city council member. ''The resistance is a big problem. But in my opinion, some of them will join the new government to build a new Iraq. Others will try to cause trouble, but the Iraqi police will do their job.''
 In the southern holy city of Najaf, where the most powerful Shiite clerics in Iraq reside, people wondered what changes the transfer would really bring.
 ''I don't see the handover as an important thing,'' said Radi Aziz Hassan, 36, a teacher. ''The most important thing is whether this government will change our tragic situation. Is the occupation truly finished? All these are claims that need to be discussed.''
 The ''tragic situation'' Mr. Hassan referred to -- the chronic lack of electricity and clean water, the high unemployment rate, the daily spasms of violence -- weighed heavily on the minds of Iraqis.
 ''State employees are benefiting under the new government,'' said Ali Khadhum, 38, a salesman in a Baghdad furniture store. ''They have good jobs and better pay. But what about ordinary citizens? What about all the people with no jobs? Will the new government provide more jobs? What will happen to them in the future Iraq?''
 Mr. Khadhum lives in the sprawling Shiite slum of Sadr City, where followers of the cleric Moktada al-Sadr have clashed with American soldiers throughout the occupation.
 The storeowner, Hussein Abdul-Wahid, also resides there, and proclaimed himself a supporter of Mr. Sadr. After finishing afternoon prayers, he stood up on a prayer rug in a corner of the store and turned to a reporter.
 ''Everybody is backing Sistani and Sadr,'' he said, referring to Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, the most influential Shiite cleric in Iraq. ''They are our marjaia, our high clerics, and we follow them 100 percent. The Americans and the new government will be like Saddam. They won't give a big role to the clerics. They won't be allowed to have a big influence on the people.''
 Despite Mr. Abdul-Wahid's skepticism about the intentions of the Americans here, he allowed himself a bit of optimism.
 ''I hope that this new government is going to meet the needs of the Iraqi people,'' he said. ''Iraq suffered under such a severe regime for three and a half decades. The Iraqi people deserve good things.''
 That same sliver of hope could be seen in front of the headquarters of the Iraqi Communist Party, where men with dented trumpets blasted notes of triumph as a crowd banged drums and waved red flags.
 ''This is the beginning of the rebuilding of the new Iraq,'' said Sabih al-Badalihi, a 52-year-old union boss.
 When asked why he was holding a red flag instead of the Iraqi national banner, he said, ''We will not dance under Saddam's flag.''
 Across the city, a Shiite baker, Imad Karim Abd, who said he had once been tortured under Mr. Hussein's government, offered a blunt take on the new government.
 If the Americans leave now, he said, ''there will be thousands of explosions a day, and we will not be able to earn a penny.''
 ''I want their bases to be here,'' he said, slapping a ball of dough into a clay oven. ''I want their security.''

HEADLINE: Washington Mutual Cuts Profit Forecast, Citing Rates

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN

 BODY:
Washington Mutual Inc., one of the nation's largest mortgage lenders, sharply lowered its earnings estimates yesterday, citing rising interest rates and bloated expenses.
 The company, based in Seattle, said it anticipated earnings of $3 to $3.60 a share for the year, down from an earlier projection of $4.35 a share. 
 Washington Mutual did not return a phone call seeking comment yesterday. Kerry K. Killinger, the bank's chief executive, said in a statement that he was ''disappointed in this change in our 2004 outlook'' and added that ''we will remain focused on executing our core middle-market retail strategy.'' 
 Wall Street has been extremely bearish on banks because of concerns that their profits will fall if the Federal Reserve, as expected, begins to raise interest rates starting tomorrow. But it is too soon to tell if other banks that specialize in mortgages, home equity loans and other forms of consumer lending, like Wells Fargo & Company and the Countrywide Financial Corporation, will experience as sharp a contraction as Washington Mutual is forecasting.
 Mortgage-backed securities are another area of concern in a rising interest rate environment. Banks that have spent the last few years focusing on that segment of the market may be hammered by outsize financial setbacks as rates rise.
 Washington Mutual's announcement, which was made shortly after the stock market closed, is certain to have a sobering effect on investors concerned about the broader impact of rate increases. And traders appeared to be assuming the worst yesterday.
 Although Washington Mutual's shares rose 13 cents to $41.31 on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, they plummeted $4.51, or nearly 11 percent, to $36.80 in after-hours trading. 
 Countrywide's shares rose 41 cents to $71.50 in trading yesterday on the Big Board, but in after-hours trading its shares plunged $2.25, or 3.15 percent, to $69.25. Wells Fargo's shares rose 22 cents to $57.75 in Big Board trading yesterday but fell 75 cents, or about 1.3 percent, to $57 after hours.
 While all consumer banks' profits are at risk when rates rise, Washington Mutual is also struggling with some unique problems. It went on a major acquisition spree over the last few years, and banking analysts say it has done a poor job of cutting back expenses at the companies it has acquired.
 Wall Street observers have mentioned Washington Mutual itself as a possible takeover target, but any acquirer is certain to be hesitant about the bank's troubling exposure to rate increases and its unwieldy risk management practices.
 Earlier this month, Jonathan E. Gray, a banking analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, lowered his earnings estimates for Washington Mutual and downgraded his recommendation on the stock because of such concerns.
 ''We basically lowered our estimate because we felt the company was so inept at managing their mortgage banking hedges,'' Mr. Gray said yesterday. ''And I lowered my recommendation because there's very poor earnings visibility. The company is just not being managed well right now, which is something of a surprise.''
 Last year, about $4 trillion worth of new mortgages was underwritten nationally, according to Mr. Gray, but he said that figure would drop to about $2 trillion this year and $1 trillion next year -- a steep and rapid slide that will sideswipe any bank that has not prepared for a downturn. 
 Washington Mutual has only recently reined in its headlong rush to embrace the mortgage lending boom. For example, Mr. Gray said, the bank is still opening new retail bank branches at a breathtaking clip -- about 20 new branches a month. Other banking analysts said the bank had fared poorly in some of the new markets it had entered, particularly Denver, Atlanta and Chicago. 
 To be sure, some banking executives have shown a sense of discipline as the retail banking cycle has crested. Citigroup was rumored to be one of the banks seeking to acquire Washington Mutual, but Charles O. Prince, Citigroup's chief executive, said publicly that he did not intend to buy a major mortgage lender at the top of the cycle. 
 David A. Daberko, chief executive of the National City Corporation, said about six months ago that he was going to allow his consumer lending operation to contract because of his concerns that the market had topped.
 But some analysts say they are worried that other banking executives may not have followed the example of Mr. Prince and Mr. Daberko.
 ''Every cycle, these mortgage companies make mistakes and they tell you that they're not going to repeat the mistake,'' said Richard Bove, a banking analyst with Hoefer & Arnett. ''Then, when the next cycle comes, they repeat the mistake. They never stop expanding until the cycle blows up.''

Apple Computer to Offer Hard Drive Search Features
Steven P. Jobs, the chief executive of Apple Computer, demonstrated to 3,500 software developers a new feature for Apple computers that will allow users to search quickly for words and concepts stored on their hard drive using search technology borrowed from the company's iTunes online music service.
 The feature will be part of the next version of the Macintosh operating system, called Tiger, scheduled for release in the first half of next year. Tiger is the fifth enhancement to the Macintosh Operating System X since it was released March 2001. While it is a year away from general availability, it is at least a year ahead of Microsoft's next version of Windows, code-named Longhorn. [Page C2.]

Microsoft is making a bid to win over new software developers with a stripped-down line of products, including a free database and inexpensive developer tools. The new offerings -- called ''Express'' versions of more feature-packed Microsoft products -- are intended for the 18 million people worldwide who write useful programs, but do not make their living as software developers. [C2.]

Testimony Backs Oracle Argument
The chief executive of Lawson Software said that Oracle and PeopleSoft are its top rivals in testimony sought by Oracle to show that the business software market would stay competitive if Oracle acquired PeopleSoft. [C2.]

Ex-Tyco Counsel Thought of Leaving
Mark A. Belnick, Tyco's former general counsel, told jurors at his criminal trial that he considered quitting months before he received a $17 million bonus that prosecutors accuse him of stealing from the company. [C2.]

Deliberations Begin in Rigas Trial
Jurors began deliberations at the fraud and conspiracy trial of John J. Rigas, the founder of Adelphia Communications, two of his sons and another executive by asking for 17 documents and excerpts of testimony. [C2.]

Telmex Buying Stake in TV Operator
The Mexican telecommunications company Telmex said that it planned to buy a stake in Net Servicos de Comunicacao, Brazil's largest cable television operator, for up to $370 million. [World Business, Section W.]

Illinois County Cancels Bond Sale
Cook County in Illinois scrapped a $200 million bond sale after the Securities and Exchange Commission questioned whether brokers had misled investors about securities with yields reset periodically by auction bids. [C7.]

Meeting Focuses on Shell's Scandal
Jeroen van der Veer, left, chairman of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group, tried to contain the fury of shareholders at the annual meeting. Shareholders wanted to know how the company could have overbooked 4.5 billion barrels of oil and gas reserves and also when company officials first knew about it. Shell's reserve scandal is the subject of several regulatory investigations in both the United States and Europe. [World Business, Section W.]

Investors Await Rate Decision
Economic uncertainty overshadowed a peaceful and early transfer of power in Iraq, sending stock gauges lower. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 14.75 points, to 10,357.09; the Standard & Poor's 500 was down 1.08 point, to 1,133.35; and the Nasdaq composite dropped 5.65 points, to 2,019.82. [C7.]

Consumer spending rose 1.0 percent in May with price increases accounting for half the gain, the Commerce Department reported, worrying the bond market in advance of a Federal Reserve interest rate increase expected this week. [C14.]

Crude oil futures plunged to a two-month low. Crude oil for August delivery fell $1.31, or 3.5 percent, to $36.24 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. [C7.]

HEADLINE: Bush's Rating Falls To Its Lowest Point, New Survey Finds

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY and JANET ELDER; Fred Backus contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
President Bush's job approval rating has fallen to the lowest level of his presidency, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News poll. The poll found Americans stiffening their opposition to the Iraq war, worried that the invasion could invite domestic terrorist attacks and skeptical about whether the White House has been fully truthful about the war or about abuses at the Abu Ghraib prison.
 A majority of respondents in the poll, conducted before yesterday's transfer of power to an interim Iraqi government, said that the war was not worth its cost in American lives and that the Bush administration did not have a clear plan to restore order to Iraq.
 The survey, which showed Mr. Bush's approval rating at 42 percent, also found that nearly 40 percent of Americans say they do not have an opinion about Senator John Kerry, the likely Democratic presidential nominee, despite what have been both parties' earliest and most expensive television advertising campaigns. 
 Among those who do have an opinion, Mr. Kerry is disliked more than he is liked. More than 50 percent of respondents said that Mr. Kerry says what he thinks voters want to hear, suggesting that Mr. Bush has had success in portraying his opponent as a flip-flopper.
 Americans were more likely to believe that Mr. Bush would do a better job than Mr. Kerry would in steering the nation through a foreign crisis, and protecting it from future terrorist attacks. Support for Mr. Bush's abilities in those areas has declined in recent months, but the findings suggest that Americans are more comfortable entrusting their security to a president they know than a relatively unknown challenger. 
 Even so, the poll was scattered with warning flags for Mr. Bush, and there was evidence that his decision to go to war against Iraq has left him in a precarious political position. 
 As he heads into the fall election, Mr. Bush appears to have much riding on the transfer of power in Baghdad yesterday. The 42 percent of Americans who say they approve of the way Mr. Bush is handling his job is the lowest such figure in a Times/CBS News survey since the beginning of Mr. Bush's presidency in January 2001; 51 percent say they disapprove.
 Over the last 25 years, according to pollsters, presidents with job approval ratings below 50 percent in the spring of election years have generally gone on to lose. Mr. Bush's father had a 34 percent job approval rating at this time in 1992.
 Similarly, 45 percent said they had an unfavorable opinion of Mr. Bush himself, again the most negative measure the Times/CBS Poll has found since he took office. And 57 percent say the country is going in the wrong direction, another measure used by pollsters as a barometer of discontent with an incumbent.
 Yet the survey found little evidence that Mr. Kerry has been able to take advantage of the president's difficulties, even though Mr. Kerry has spent $60 million on television advertising over the last three months. 
 Nationwide, Mr. Kerry has the support of 45 percent of registered voters, with Mr. Bush supported by 44 percent. When Ralph Nader, who is running as an independent, is included, he draws 5 percent, leaving 42 percent for Mr. Kerry and 43 percent for Mr. Bush.
 In the 18 states viewed by both parties as the most competitive, the race was equally tight. Forty-five percent of voters in those states said they would support Mr. Kerry, and 43 percent said they would back Mr. Bush. Indeed, on a host of measures, the poll found little difference in public opinion between the nation as a whole and voters in the competitive states.
 The tight race indicated by the poll reflects how aides to both Mr. Bush and Mr. Kerry have described the overall state of play for weeks. But other polls have, at times, shown Mr. Kerry or Mr. Bush bumping ahead. A CBS News poll taken last month found Mr. Kerry with a lead of 49 percent to 41 percent over Mr. Bush.
 The new Times/CBS News poll, of 1,053 adults, including 875 registered voters, was taken by telephone June 23 to June 27. It has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.
 For all the signs of opposition to the war, Americans appear prepared to stay in Iraq until the situation becomes stable. Fifty-four percent of poll respondents said that the United States should remain in Iraq ''as long as it takes,'' while 40 percent said the United States should withdraw ''as soon as possible.'' 
 Over all, the poll's findings left little doubt about the extent to which Mr. Bush's decision to go to war is proving to be the most fateful of his presidency. About 60 percent of respondents said they disapproved of Mr. Bush's Iraq policy, while just over 50 percent said they disapproved of his foreign policy. 
 And 60 percent of respondents said the war has not been worth the cost.
 ''We attacked a sovereign nation, and we went in there and we did things that the United States shouldn't have done,'' Charles Drum, 36, a Republican from Alameda, Calif., said in an interview after the poll was taken. ''I feel that we went after the wrong people, and it's unacceptable, and it's absolutely ridiculous that innocent people are dying over there in Iraq, and our own troops are dying for a cause that is not just.''
 Respondents said that Mr. Bush's policies in Iraq were having the effect of creating terrorists and of increasing the chances of another terrorist attack at home. Concerns about the war appear to undercut what has long been one of Mr. Bush's strong suits, his handling of the fight against terrorism. Fifty-two percent of Americans now say they approve of the way Mr. Bush is conducting that fight, down from 90 percent in December 2001.
 ''I watch the news quite a bit, and I'm kind of thinking it's getting these terrorists motivated to do more,'' said Charlie Buck, 54, a Republican from Indiana, Pa. ''Whether it's their religious beliefs or it's us trying to step into their country, I just get that feeling that they feel that we're stepping into where we shouldn't be, and it's inciting them.''
 In what could prove to be a particularly far-reaching development for Mr. Bush -- especially because he and his campaign have sought to undercut Mr. Kerry's credibility -- nearly 60 percent said he was not being entirely truthful when talking about Iraq. Similarly, just 15 percent said the administration had told the entire truth when it came to abuses at the Abu Ghraib prison.
 There are some ways in which Mr. Kerry and Mr. Bush are viewed similarly. They are seen as leaders who keep their word, and both are viewed as optimistic, suggesting that Mr. Bush's attempt to portray Mr. Kerry as pessimistic has not taken hold.
 But Mr. Kerry was described as more likely than Mr. Bush to admit a mistake, and to listen to divergent opinions. Mr. Bush is viewed as someone who takes a position and sticks with it.
 ''Kerry has flip-flopped too many times,'' said Joseph Martin, 52, an independent voter who lives outside Seattle. ''The one thing that I think that a lot of people understand is a position of strength, and you cannot be waffling around. You've got to show a commitment, show a determination and keep a steady hand, and I just don't think Kerry has got that.'' 
 For Mr. Bush, the poll contains a number of potentially worrisome findings. By 51 to 32 percent, Americans believe that he has divided the nation, rather than brought it together. The number of Americans who said that Mr. Bush did not care about the ''needs and problems of people like you'' edged up to 42 percent from 36 percent in March. 
 On the issue of the economy, even though job-creation numbers have been rising over the last few months, 45 percent of Americans say that the Bush administration has been responsible for a decline in jobs, compared with 24 percent who say it has brought an increase. 
 Republicans, remembering what happened when Mr. Bush's father lost in 1992, have long expressed concern that any improvement in the economy will happen too late to capture the notice of voters.
 More people held unfavorable than favorable opinions of Mr. Bush and Mr. Kerry. The number of people who view Mr. Kerry unfavorably has jumped to 35 percent from 29 percent in mid-March, when Mr. Bush began a huge television advertising campaign against his opponent.
 In Mr. Kerry's case, 36 percent said they had no opinion of him, despite the campaign's record-setting expenditure on television advertisements. That figure is fairly typical for challengers at this point in the campaign; in June 1992, 44 percent of the public did not have an opinion of Bill Clinton.

How the Poll Was Conducted
 The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Wednesday through Sunday with 1,053 adults throughout the United States. Of these, 875 said they were registered to vote.
 The sample of telephone exchanges called was randomly selected by a computer from a complete list of more than 42,000 active residential exchanges across the country. Within each exchange, random digits were added to form a complete telephone number, thus permitting access to listed and unlisted numbers alike. Within each household, one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the survey.
 The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for variation in the sample relating to geographic region, sex, race, Hispanic origin, marital status, age and education.
 Residents of 18 political swing states were oversampled for analysis and then weighted to their proper share of the population.
 Based on the 2000 presidential vote, residents of heavily Republican counties, heavily Democratic counties, and politically competitive counties were weighted to their proper share of the population.
 In theory, in 19 cases out of 20, overall results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all American adults.
 For smaller subgroups the margin of sampling error is larger.
 In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll. Variation in the wording and order of questions, for example, may lead to somewhat different results.

HEADLINE: AIRLINE SHOCK WAVES: THE OVERVIEW; United Again Denied U.S. Aid to Emerge From Chapter 11

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD; Riva D. Atlas contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
The third attempt by United Airlines to get a package of government loan guarantees failed yesterday, and it will not get a fourth chance.
 United, the nation's second-largest airline, now faces the daunting task of emerging from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection without the federal aid it was counting on. To persuade lenders and investors to put up the money it needs, the airline is expected to turn to its workers for new cuts in jobs, wages and benefits on a scale approaching the $2.5 billion a year that they have already accepted since the airline filed for bankruptcy in 2002. 
 The 3-to-0 vote by the Air Transportation Stabilization Board ended nearly two years of efforts by United, a subsidiary of the UAL Corporation, to secure loan guarantees. The board was created in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks to help stabilize the aviation industry, but analysts said the decision to shut the door on United might instead touch off a fresh round of turmoil in the industry. 
 With United having to make deep cuts in labor costs to survive, analysts said that competitors like AMR's American Airlines and Delta Air Lines would be under intense pressure to follow suit, and one or more of the major full-fare airlines might be forced out of the game as a result. 
 In an 11th-hour effort to sway the board, United reduced its request for federal backing by $500 million, to $1.1 billion, after the board rejected its bid for $1.6 billion in guarantees on June 17, a decision that was enveloped in political controversy.
 Closing the United case effectively ends deliberations by the board, which includes one representative each from the Treasury and Transportation Departments, and the Federal Reserve. The board will now exist mainly to oversee the loan guarantees, totaling $1.56 billion, that were awarded to six other airlines during its tenure.
 For now, the board's decision has little effect on passengers. The airline, based near Chicago, has continued to operate its full system of domestic and international routes while under bankruptcy protection.
 But it put immediate pressure on the airline's management to find lenders, and probably new equity investors as well, who are willing to provide $2 billion or more in new capital. The company must move swiftly. It faces a July 15 deadline for a crucial decision on whether to continue funding its employee pension plans, and a Sept. 15 deadline for making a $700 million contribution to those plans. July is also when its time runs out to present a restructuring plan to the bankruptcy court, though it may get another extension. 
 United said yesterday that it disagreed with the board's decision, but that it was ''already moving forward to secure the exit financing we need to take United out of bankruptcy.'' Referring to the board by its initials, the airline said, ''The message from the A.T.S.B. is that we can get the exit financing we need on our own.''
 United officials and the airline's financial advisers have already begun work on a plan that could include proposals for fresh cuts of $2 billion to $2.5 billion a year in wages and benefits, people involved in the effort said yesterday. United warned employees last week to expect another round of cost-cutting, without mentioning a figure.
 United's unions reacted with dismay to the board's ruling, but at the same time made clear their opposition to any further wage or benefit cuts. Mark Bathurst, chairman of the pilots' union, said the group expected solutions to United's crisis to be found ''without the company again turning to employees, who have already provided significant financial relief.''
 The International Association of Machinists was more blunt. Randy Canale, president of District Lodge 141, called on United to resist efforts to use employees as ''human fertilizer'' to satisfy potential lenders. ''It will not serve United to exit bankruptcy at the expense of thousands of front-line employees, on whose backs the airline's recovery ultimately rests,'' Mr. Canale said in a statement.
 The board rejected United's original application in December 2002 because it found the airline's financial plans unrealistic, but gave United permission to try again. The second application was rejected June 17 on a 2-to-0 vote, with the board saying that United had not shown either that it was unable to get financing on its own or that it was a ''necessary part'' of the country's transportation system, two requirements for granting loan guarantees. After the second vote, the Treasury Department, whose representative had voted no, and the Transportation Department, whose representative had abstained, decided to offer United another opportunity to amend its application, a chance that no other airline had been given.
 That move came after the Treasury secretary, John W. Snow, was contacted on the airline's behalf by the House speaker, J. Dennis Hastert, Republican of Illinois, United's home state, who has been a vocal advocate for the airline. A senior White House official also called Mr. Snow, expressing concern, according to people close to the situation.
 United reduced the amount of the guarantees it sought by nearly one-third, cut their duration to five years from seven, and pledged to find more private financing. But yesterday, all three board members -- Treasury Under Secretary Brian C. Roseboro; Edward Gramlich, a governor of the Federal Reserve; and Jeffrey N. Shane of the Transportation Department -- voted no. 
 United's applications roiled the industry in a two-year debate. Even the third and smallest loan-guarantee package it requested would have been larger than any other the board granted. US Airways was given $900 million in guarantees in 2003, helping it emerge from bankruptcy.
 Many of United's competitors, large and small, lobbied publicly and privately against giving it federal assistance. And even those who took no stand said they were upset by the process.
 Herbert D. Kelleher, chairman of Southwest Airlines, said in an interview this spring that the board's loan guarantees had distorted industry competition. David Neeleman, chief executive of JetBlue Airways, said in an interview last week that the situation had turned into ''a bit of a circus.''
 At the beginning of the year, analysts had expected the airline industry as a whole to turn a small profit this year, for the first time since 2000. But sharp increases in fuel costs since then mean that the airlines are now expected to lose at least $3 billion in 2004. 
 Executives at United, including its chief executive, Glenn F. Tilton, and its chief financial officer, Frederic F. Brace III, had insisted before the second vote that United could emerge from bankruptcy with or without federal assistance. 
 Now, the airline will have to prove that contention. ''Essentially, the federal government has called United's bluff,'' said Jan K. Brueckner, professor of economics at the University of Illinois.
 United, which has interim financing to last it through the end of the year, had been counting on a combination of federally backed loans and new private money to emerge from bankruptcy sometime this fall. In December 2003, it said it had lined up $2 billion in exit financing from J.P. Morgan and Citigroup, but most of that was contingent on a yes vote from the board. 
 Both banks said yesterday that they were continuing to work with United on its exit strategy, but that it was too early to comment on the specifics of any new strategy.
 Robert W. Mann Jr., an industry consultant based in Port Washington, N.Y., said it would probably take the rest of the year for United to find investors, cut its costs and address other outstanding issues in its bankruptcy case. He predicted that United would not be able to emerge from bankruptcy protection before the spring of 2005 at the earliest.
 Judge Eugene R. Wedoff of United States Bankruptcy Court has given management the exclusive right to file a reorganization plan for the airline only through July 30. At the end of May, the airline asked for a three-month extension, to Sept. 30, but the judge granted only one month. 
 Analysts said that the crucial area where lenders and investors would want to see United make significant new cuts was its pension plans. Beyond the $700 million cash payment due in mid-September, United needs to pay some $4.1 billion over the next five years to fund its pensions, which cover 62,000 active and 27,000 retired workers and have not yet been touched.
 According to Standard & Poor's, the financial rating agency, United's operating costs are higher on average than those of the industry's largest carrier, American Airlines, which persuaded its unions to grant concessions last year on the threat of a bankruptcy filing, or Continental Airlines, which went through bankruptcy twice in the 1980's and 1990's.
 People who have been briefed on United's internal deliberations said that the airline might now strive to reduce its costs far below those of American or Continental and closer to low-fare carriers like Southwest and JetBlue, two of the industry's leanest companies. If that happens, rivals like Delta and Northwest Airlines, which are already talking to their unions about concessions, may have little choice but to turn up the heat.
 United, in its statement yesterday, said its lenders ''continue to be tremendously supportive of us.'' Saying that its new capital will come largely through debt, United's statement added, ''We are now holding discussions with our lenders and others to determine what an appropriate overall capital structure might be.''
 In a research report issued after the board's third and final vote, S.&P. said that United's ability to attract new capital would depend both on its own efforts and on an absence of any external events like a terrorist attack or a further rise in fuel prices, which could scare off investors.
 Professor Brueckner said the advantages of United's old structure, with a broad route system serving many small American cities as well as major outposts abroad, might not be as attractive as it once was. In the United States and elsewhere, low-fare airlines are grabbing a greater share of passengers and earning profits by keeping costs low.
 ''You need a blank slate for the old airlines to be competitive with low-fare airlines, and we're simply not there yet,'' he said, '' It's simply so difficult to erase the historic impact of these carriers.'' 
 He added: ''I wouldn't want to see United go away. It's part of our national psyche. But on the other hand, you have to let the market do what it will.''

HEADLINE: Nassau County Issues Free Cards to Provide Discounts on Medicines

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT; Gardiner Harris contributed reporting from New York for this article.

DATELINE: MINEOLA, N.Y., June 29 

 BODY:
A free discount drug card is being mass-mailed this week to more than 500,000 homes on Long Island in what Nassau County officials say is a model effort to curb the sharply rising cost of medicines.
 The mailing is the nation's largest distribution of a locally sponsored prescription discount card, Nassau officials say. The concept has sparked interest from officials in New York City and elsewhere who are considering adopting their own versions.
 Although a few such municipal plans exist elsewhere, Nassau says its program has a unique combination of features that makes it superior to the others and even to the new federal discount cards for the elderly. 
 Every Nassau resident is eligible for the card, regardless of age, income or insurance, unlike most other government plans.
 The program, called NassauRx, costs the patient nothing; others often charge fees ranging from $10 to $30 a year. The card requires no application or other paperwork, unlike most other plans. It will be accepted at 75 percent of Nassau's drugstores, and their branches around the country. It entitles customers to discounts averaging 15 to 20 percent for brand-name drugs and up to 50 percent for generics, county officials say. And there is no cost to the county, and no fee for residents to join. 
 ''Starting today, there is no need for anyone in Nassau County to pay retail prices for prescription drugs,'' County Comptroller Howard S. Weitzman said at a news conference here. The discounts will help people of marginal means avoid ''making a daily choice between putting food on the table and taking the full prescribed dose of life-sustaining medications,'' he said.
 Nassau solicited nine bids from companies that administer drug cards and awarded the contract to AdvancePCS, a division of Caremark Rx in Nashville. The company printed and mailed the cards and is running the program under county oversight.
 AdvancePCS negotiated prices with drug manufacturers, including rebates for itself, and with drugstores, who pay some fees to participate. Although discounts cut profits for the stores, they join to stay competitive and hope to make up the loss on volume.
 The nearest counties with drug-discount cards are Westchester in New York and Bergen in New Jersey, both of which require applications and charge fees. Bergen's is for people ages 55 and older.
 Beyond such government discount cards, myriad other drug plans have sprung up around the country in recent years, sponsored by companies and groups, from the AARP's prescription card to the Readers Digest and drugstore-chains plans.
 Critics say that such plans can be confusing and hard to monitor, with elusive savings because of changing prices, varied discounts and lack of coverage for some drugs.
 ''When someone offers you a 15 percent discount on something, your first question should be, 'A 15 percent discount off of what price?''' said Ron Pollack, executive director of Families U.S.A., a consumer group in Washington.
 But Dr. Tricia Neuman, vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit health policy organization, said that ''the cards have the potential to provide some help.'' 
 Leon and Phyllis Gold of Oceanside, N.Y., were clearly pleased when they were chosen to become the first users of NassauRx at their neighborhood pharmacy, Ocean Chemist, on Tuesday morning. 
 The Golds said their discount totaled about $40 on their monthly prescriptions for osteoporosis and blood-thinner. At that rate, their savings would reach nearly $500 a year. Mr. Gold, 85, a retired builder, said, ''I'd love to participate in anything that will save money.'' 
 The Golds' druggist, Jorge L. Winter, said he did not mind honoring the discounts. ''Do you know how many times customers come to me with three prescriptions, get the prices and say they can't afford all three and ask which is the most important?'' he said. ''It breaks my heart. So many people fall between the cracks, who don't have insurance, who aren't Medicaid eligible. That's why this card is so great. What our forefathers wanted us to have is life, liberty and prescription coverage for all.''
 NassauRx is a discount card and not health insurance, Comptroller Weitzman stressed, and ''it's certainly not the solution to all of our health care problems.'' Health care costs have been rising faster than general inflation, and drug prices are the biggest single factor, experts say.
 But Mr. Weitzman said that the card offers relief to the estimated 350,000 of Nassau's 1.3 million residents who have insufficient or no insurance. Most insurance limits spending on drugs.
 Nassau used its voter list for the mailing, because that was the biggest one available. But the plan is not limited to voters, and additional advertising is aimed at distributing as many cards as possible.
 In fact, because the cards will carry no name and a household can obtain extra copies, people outside the county will conceivably be able to get them. And although Nassau officials are not encouraging that, they are not making an issue of it, either.

HEADLINE: Study Confirms 9/11 Impact On New York City Economy

BYLINE: By LYDIA POLGREEN

 BODY:
The World Trade Center attack on Sept. 11, 2001, cost the city's economy 143,000 jobs a month and $2.8 billion in lost wages in the subsequent three months, a far greater impact than could be attributed to the recession that had begun earlier that year, according to a study to be published today by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
 The report, which is the first economic analysis of the attack to use actual federal job data reported by employers rather than surveys or samples, in many ways confirms what was already known: that the attack had an immediate, devastating effect on the economy.
 The report starkly shows that the attack plunged New York into a deep recession independent of the economic downturn already gripping the city, with the deepest impact on the high-paying jobs in industries that drive the local economy.
 Nearly 70 percent of the jobs lost and 86 percent of the wages lost were in fields like finance, insurance and banking. 
 ''The effect was centered on the jobs that make New York's economy unique,'' said Michael L. Dolfman, regional commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics and author of the report. ''We lost the high-paying jobs, the people who pay more real estate taxes, higher sales taxes and support various elements of the economy.''
 While the city's economy was already in decline, that downturn could not account for the huge job losses immediately after the attack, according to the study, which is to be posted today at the Web site of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, bls.gov, and published in The Monthly Labor Review.
 Economists and business leaders said the findings highlighted the special vulnerability of the city's economy to sudden shocks, because it is so dominated by a single industry. 
 Kathryn S. Wylde, president and chief executive of the Partnership for New York City, said the report was compelling evidence that the state and federal government must treat New York's security and infrastructure needs differently.''We need to be sure we are getting our share of homeland security money and ensuring employers and visitors that New York is secure and protected,'' Ms. Wylde said. 
 Though employment in New York has remained basically flat over the last 30 years, wages have risen sharply as the mix of jobs has radically changed. Manufacturing, once the employer of a large middle class, has shriveled, while professional fields have grown. As New York evolved into the capital of an increasingly global economy, the average wage of city workers in what the report calls the ''export economy'' rose to about $100,000. 
 As a result, the city's economy has come to be defined by a relative handful of very high-wage jobs, Mr. Dolfman said, and as those jobs go, so does the rest of the city. In Manhattan, the hardest-hit borough, about a third of the total jobs lost were in finance, and they accounted for more than 55 percent of the wages, the study showed. Tourism-related businesses were hit second-hardest. 
 Queens, too, saw a sharp job loss -- about 15,000 jobs a month in the three months after the terrorist attack. Losses were heaviest at Kennedy and La Guardia Airports, with air transportation accounting for more than 60 percent of the jobs lost and nearly 80 percent of the wages. The impact on the other boroughs was noticeable, but not nearly as pronounced, the study found.
 Manhattan's borough president, C. Virginia Fields, said the report illustrated the importance of diversifying the economy with other, more stable industries. 
 ''When Wall Street is down, everything dies in New York,'' Ms. Fields said. ''We have not done enough to keep and expand jobs in other areas.''

HEADLINE: Japan Aims to Stiffen Antitrust Penalties

BYLINE: By TODD ZAUN

DATELINE: TOKYO, June 29 

 BODY:
Could Japan's fair trade watchdog finally be getting teeth?
 In the last year, the notoriously tame Fair Trade Commission has burst forth with a series of high-profile investigations. 
 It went after a unit of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone for charging rivals high fees to gain access to its network. (The unit is appealing a commission ruling that it was violating the antimonopoly law.) It raided the Japanese offices of the computer industry heavyweights Microsoft and Intel on suspicion that the companies violated fair competition laws. (Both have denied any wrongdoing.) And this month it raided the Japanese offices of more than 10 tire makers, including Bridgestone and a unit of Goodyear Tire and Rubber, accusing them of rigging bids for military contracts. (The companies declined to comment while the investigation is under way.) 
 Now, the agency is hoping to get tougher still with a proposal for the most sweeping overhaul of Japan's antimonopoly act in a quarter of a century, proposals that are aimed primarily at bid rigging and price fixing.
 So far, though, despite the support of international economic organizations, the Bush administration and Japanese consumer groups, a bill that would codify the changes has been held up largely because of opposition from Japan's leading big-business lobby, Nippon Keidanren.
 The group argues that the Fair Trade Commission's operations should be made more transparent before the commission is given more power.
 Behind the battle is an old clash of ideas about how the economy should be run.
 In the Japan of the 1980's, the prevailing notion was that some backroom coordination among competing companies to set prices and production levels was needed to keep the economy running smoothly. Such ideas have been mostly discredited over the last two decades here, as companies like Honda Motor and Sony shunned such practices to compete in global markets and emerged as the nation's strongest competitors.
 ''Fair competition is essential for economic growth,'' the Fair Trade Commission chairman, Kazuhiko Takeshima, who is leading the push for tougher penalties, said in a recent interview. ''It is true not only for the total economy, but also for the individual industries and even individual companies.''
 While Japan's automakers and electronics companies understand the value of competition, he said, ''Companies that compete only in the domestic market wholesale, retail, distribution and construction, public utilities, these industrial sections still do not believe 100 percent in the market mechanism, but rather that some manipulation is necessary.''
 With the backing of the reform-minded administration of Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, Mr. Takeshima helped draft legislation to strengthen the commission's investigative powers and double the fines it can impose on companies found to have engaged in bid rigging or price fixing.
 The legislation would also give his regulators a tool that has been successfully used for two decades in the United States to root out antitrust violators: a so-called leniency provision that would allow the commission to waive penalties for companies that blow the whistle on their co-conspirators.
 Mr. Takeshima says current penalties do little to deter bid rigging or price fixing for a very simple reason -- they are often smaller than the profits earned from such illegal activity.
 ''If we don't make it so that violating the antimonopoly law doesn't pay, the violations won't end,'' he said.
 Antitrust experts say the changes are needed to bring Japan's antimonopoly act in line with laws in the United States and Europe. Harmonizing antitrust laws is important, they say, because of the growing number of international cartels, like the vitamin price-fixing cartel in the 1990's, which included companies from the United States, Europe and Japan.
 Since Japanese regulators cannot now offer whistle-blowers freedom from prosecution, cartel members are unlikely to report their activities to them, and the burden of cracking down on international cartels is likely to fall disproportionately on regulators in the United States and Europe, an American government official said.
 Over the last year, Mr. Takeshima, a former finance ministry bureaucrat who studied economics at Johns Hopkins University, has traveled around Japan delivering speeches on the virtues of competition to dozens of skeptical business groups.
 A slender man with a deep voice and quick smile, Mr. Takeshima has won widespread support at home and abroad for the proposed changes. But he has failed so far to win over the Keidanren, a powerful business lobby whose membership includes nearly every large Japanese company.
 The group's chairman, Hiroshi Okuda, who is also the chairman of the Toyota Motor Corporation, the world's second-biggest carmaker, told reporters in Tokyo that the Keidanren thinks the changes are ''too hasty.''
 According to Mitsuru Shinozaki, a Keidanren spokesman, the group believes that current laws give the Fair Trade Commission too much leeway in determining penalties, which vary arbitrarily even for similar violations.
 The Keidanren, he said, will oppose any increases in penalties and the leniency proposal unless they are part of a thorough overhaul of the laws governing the commission.
 ''We know that the rules of fair trade must exist and all the companies must follow the rules, but only if they're legally sound, and the current Japanese system is not legally sound,'' Mr. Shinozaki said.
 The Keidanren and many of its members are strong supporters of the more conservative wings of Mr. Koizumi's Liberal Democratic Party. Mr. Takeshima was hoping the party would submit his bills to Parliament for a vote during the legislative session that ended this month, but because of the Keidanren's opposition the bills have yet to be presented. Mr. Takeshima says he is confident the bills will be passed into law during a special session of Parliament in the fall.
 Although Japanese antitrust laws are based on United States laws, Japan's competition watchdog has long been criticized for lacking the kind of bite regulators in the United States have. Illegal cartels and bid rigging have been common in Japan, particularly in the construction industry, but violators have almost never faced criminal prosecution and fines are typically less than half of those levied for similar violations in the United States and Europe.
 Currently, Japanese laws cap the penalties for bid rigging and price fixing at big companies at 6 percent of sales generated from the illegal activity. The Fair Trade Commission is hoping to double the penalty to 12 percent of illegal profits, and raise it to 18 percent for repeat offenders.
 Antitrust experts say a leniency program to encourage whistle-blowers would do even more to help Japan break up cartels.
 ''One of the strongest lessons of the last 10 to 15 years is that leniency programs lead to the discovery of unlawful conduct and its prosecution,'' says Abbot B. Lipsky Jr., a specialist in international antitrust law at the Washington office of Latham & Watkins.
 Even as the Fair Trade Commission pushes for stricter laws, it has already become tougher.
 Mr. Takeshima says the continuing investigations into Intel and Microsoft are the first instances of the agency's taking action against such big foreign companies.
 Investigators raided the Japanese office of Intel in April on suspicion that the company unfairly pressured computer makers to keep them from buying rival chips. ''We believe our business practices are fair,'' said Masatoshi Mizuno, a spokesman for the company in Japan.
 Two months earlier, the watchdog began investigating whether a restrictive clause in Microsoft's contracts with computer equipment makers violated antitrust laws. Though Microsoft denied wrongdoing, it did drop the clause from its contracts.
 The toughest penalties the companies are likely to face if found to have engaged in monopolistic behavior are cease and desist orders.

HEADLINE: Caught in America's War

BYLINE: By Ha-yun Jung. 
Ha-yun Jung is working on a novel.

DATELINE: SEONGNAM, South Korea 

 BODY:
The image of a South Korean hostage, Kim Sun Il, blindfolded and kneeling at gunpoint before his death in Iraq last week was a chillingly familiar one for us back in his homeland -- despite the orange jumpsuit, the masked faces and the foreign tongue. 
 For a century Koreans have collected reel after reel of grisly memories as victims and perpetrators of war and oppression. We endured acts of torture and tyranny under Japanese colonial rule, then inflicted them ourselves on our countrymen in the Korean War and on dissidents during nearly four decades of dictatorships and military regimes. 
 Now we can't help but wonder: why are we reliving these traumas in Iraq, in a faraway country we hardly know? Isn't it clear that our involvement -- and the danger that accompanies it -- will only increase now that America has handed official sovereignty over to Iraq? 
 It's impossible to understand the Korean presence in Iraq without understanding our complex and unequal relationship with the United States. In fact, our role in Iraq parallels our role in another American-led conflict, the Vietnam War. 
 From 1963 to 1975, President Park Chung Hee sent 312,853 Korean troops to Vietnam, in return for economic aid from the United States and of course, to solidify the alliance between the two countries. More than 4,600 South Koreans lost their lives, and thousands more were wounded. In that war, our men earned precious dollars by selling C-rations and Lucky Strikes on the black market; less gloriously, they fathered and deserted thousands of half-Vietnamese children and committed their own massacres. 
 Then we moved on, working maniacally to build our economy and to slowly make the transition to democracy. But under this success, beneath the skyscrapers and S.U.V.'s, the cellphones and Prada-clad teenagers, our old wounds linger. 
 When Kim Sun Il was beheaded, President Bush said that the United States would not be intimidated by the terrorists. His words were soon echoed by our president, Roh Moo Hyun, whose reputation as a left-leaning populist was a source of concern in Washington when he was elected last year, but who is now adamant about sending 3,000 more troops to Iraq to join the 660 already there. The first deployment was comprised of military engineers and doctors, but this time we will send combat forces, tanks and heavy artillery. If the government has its way, South Korea will have the third largest number of foreign troops in Iraq, behind the United States and Britain.
 So Mr. Kim's death is only the beginning of another reel. What will follow is more South Korean casualties, then another call for additional troops, then more deaths. Our government keeps talking about the national interest, but what does that mean? The privilege to win more subcontracts to supply pillows and sunglasses to American soldiers only to be taken from the delivery truck, killed and tossed out, headless and booby-trapped? As in 1963, the government's real goal seems to be convincing the United States that we're on its side. 
 But something has changed. We are no longer caught up in the ideological paranoia of the cold war as we were in my childhood. What's more, we are no longer a nation that lives with the threat of being locked up for speaking our minds. Kim Sun Il's mother did not hesitate to crush the funeral bouquet sent by President Roh, in front of TV cameras, moaning: ''What good is all this? My son is dead.'' 
 What the insurgents demanded in return for Kim Sun Il's life was the cancellation of the deployment of more South Korean troops to Iraq. And that is what we should have done, not because that is what terrorists asked for -- but because, for once, it is in our national interest.

PERSON: Marvin Markus 

HEADLINE: Happily a Target of Landlords and Tenants Alike

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN

 BODY:
O.K., so Marvin Markus may not land on anyone's Top 10 List of Beloved Public Officials. Landlords don't care for him, and say that they have never been as unhappy as they are now. Tenants call him Marvin Markup, and accuse him of engineering cruel rent increases. And, who knows, maybe someone will someday resurrect the marionette that New York City renters made in his likeness more than two decades ago. ''They said that Ed Koch was pulling the strings,'' Mr. Markus says.
 But go ahead, hurl your nastiest insult at him. Pull out your cleverest poster. As the longest-serving and arguably most dominant chairman in the history of the city's Rent Guidelines Board, Mr. Markus is used to getting beat up by all comers. He may even kind of like it. 
 ''It doesn't trouble me,'' he says. ''It takes a thick skin to be involved in those kinds of things.''
 Every spring, Mr. Markus, 55, an affable and quick-witted investment banker, morphs into the bete noire of New York's polarized housing community. He leads a board that includes two people representing landlords, two representing tenants and four others appointed by the mayor. And boy, is that a great civic gig -- if, by great, you mean being squeezed by intense political pressures and qualifying for a measly $100 per diem that hasn't changed since the board's inception in the late 1960's. (The chairman is actually eligible for -- oooh -- $125, but Mr. Markus declines it.)
 But inherent in the job is tremendous power, for the board determines rental increases for the city's one million rent-stabilized apartments. And this spring, Mr. Markus drew exceptional ire -- first for proposing a range of increases rather than a specific percentage during a preliminary vote in May, then for successfully shepherding a proposal to raise rents by up to 6.5 percent through a raucous final vote two weeks ago.
 Landlords say that the increase will do little to defray their rising costs. Tenants, convinced that Mr. Markus has an agenda to shrink the city's vast rent-regulation system, want Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg to fire him. A small group even protested outside his day job at Goldman Sachs, where he is a vice president specializing in municipal finance, and working on projects involving Hudson Yards and the United Nations Development Corporation.
 But to Mr. Markus, that kind of bipartisan sturm und drang is something that may be necessary to achieving what he says is the ultimate goal: helping to preserve the city's stock of apartments for low- and middle-income residents, through a complex rent-regulation system that could be conceivable only in New York.
 ''Generally, the board has done a very fair and equitable job of balancing all the needs,'' says Mr. Markus, who calls himself a ''swing vote.'' 
 You can ask Mr. Markus, who was born in Germany in a refugee resettlement camp and grew up in Montreal and Brooklyn, a million ways why he has taken on so thankless a job, and he'll cite an enduring interest in housing policy. Ever since he became active in Brooklyn Democratic politics while attending Brooklyn College. Ever since he got a job as a research associate at the Citizens Housing and Planning Council (where he is now the president), while earning a master's degree in urban planning from New York University. Ever since he became a protege of Roger Starr, an outspoken city housing official who later became an editorial writer for The New York Times.
 In 1979, at the age of 31, Mr. Markus was appointed by Mayor Edward I. Koch as the chairman of the rent board for the first time. The meetings were far more raucous then, he says, because the board had previously huddled in private. So when the board pushed through double-digit increases because of inflation and rising fuel costs, apoplectic tenants nicknamed him Marvin Markup.
 He stepped down in 1984, moving to Jericho, on Long Island, with his wife, Michelle, an interior decorator; their daughter, Adria, now 31, and their son, Bryce, 27. (Both children work for Goldman Sachs.)
 HIS civic instincts lay dormant in suburbia. But when Mr. Markus and his wife moved back to the city in 2001, buying an apartment near Lincoln Center, he asked Mr. Bloomberg to appoint him rent-board chairman again. That thick skin, again.
 In some ways, there aren't too many differences between Markus I and Markus II. The same posters appear, except that the name of the mayor has changed. The same faces show up to the same Kabuki-like meetings, if a bit fleshier and grayer. ''The season ticketholders,'' he calls them.
 He has also learned, he says, to let the audience stew for a while. Sometimes, he will arch his right eyebrow and right upper lip, then go into a good-natured snort of a laugh. ''There's energy in the room, and energy has a tendency to dissipate, so you need dissipation strategies,'' he says.
 To escape the pressures of work and public life, he has become an avid theatergoer, favoring musical revivals. He also signed up recently for a movie-appreciation course at New York University, and he gives big thumbs-ups to ''Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind'' and ''Dogville.''
 But during one class, he spotted Jimmy Silber, a regular fixture at rent board meetings who is affiliated with the Small Property Owners of New York. Ah, the smallness of the world. ''You can't get away,'' Mr. Markus said, chuckling.

HEADLINE: Publisher Expands to Take Most of the Flatiron Building

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE

 BODY:
For more than 100 years, the massive limestone and terra-cotta wedge that is Manhattan's famed Flatiron Building has been known for its singular shape and its prime location at the intersection of Broadway, Fifth Avenue and 23rd Street.
 Now the three-sided 20-story building, which once housed a crop of small companies, may well become associated with its main tenant. Last week, Holtzbrinck Publishers -- the parent of St. Martin's Press and Henry Holt, among others -- closed a deal to expand to 18 floors from 12 in the 180,000-square-foot structure. The company, whose existing lease expires this year, also has the option to take the remaining two floors over the next five years. 
 ''Over time, it will be their own building,'' said Leon Manoff, who with Robert L. Freedman, a colleague at the real estate firm GVA Williams, represented Holtzbrinck in the deal. The lease, Mr. Manoff said, took six months to complete and will enable the company to grow to 157,500 square feet from 84,000. Holtzbrinck is part of Verlagsgruppe Georg von Holtzbrinck, a family-owned publishing operation based in Stuttgart, Germany.
 For the landlord, the lease indicates that ''even in a market that is not robust, the best buildings get the best tenants,'' said James D. Kuhn. Mr. Kuhn, Barry Gosin and Jeffrey R. Gural acquired 71 percent ownership in the Flatiron Building in two transactions in 1997 and 2004. The three men are also principals of Newmark & Company, a real estate services firm in Manhattan that manages the 307-foot-high building. Though dwarfed by the Chrysler Building and the Empire State Building, the structure is considered one of New York's most revered early skyscrapers. It opened in 1902 and was declared a city landmark in 1966. 
 ''There is a certain stature to being in a landmark,'' Peter G. Garabedian, chief operating officer at Holtzbrinck, said of his company's decision to expand in the Flatiron Building. He said the action was also ''an economic'' move since Holtzbrinck has a significant presence in the building. 
 Holtzbrinck will consolidate several of its Manhattan operations, including Henry Holt, now on 18th Street, in the Flatiron Building. St. Martin's Press, the trade publisher, has been in the building since 1959. ''This lease perpetuates the link between the firm and the building,'' Mr. Manoff said.
 Holtzbrinck will take over the six floors recently vacated by Springer-Verlag, a publisher of medical and scientific books, whose lease expired this year. All involved in the deal said that Holtzbrinck would probably exercise its option to lease the remaining space on the building's seventh and eighth floors, now occupied by several small companies whose leases will expire within five years.
 Mr. Kuhn said that in today's market, having a single creditworthy tenant like Holtzbrinck made sense. He also said that he and his partners have considered the possibility of eventually turning the building into a residential condominium, which would be more feasible if there were only a single tenant. 
 Under the new 15-year lease, Holtzbrinck's annual rent will start in the low $30's a square foot and increase to the mid-$30's over the term of the lease, GVA Williams said. The rent under the expiring lease is the low $20's. The average rent in the Flatiron District is $29 a square foot, Newmark said. 
 There are no renewal options built into the lease, which Mr. Kuhn said was worth at least $70 million. 
 The building is in a neighborhood that underwent significant gentrification in the 1990's, becoming a district for fashion and upscale restaurants. Today, it has clothing stores like A/X Armani Exchange at 129 Fifth Avenue between 19th and 20th Streets; Searle at 156 Fifth Avenue between 20th and 21st Streets; and, most recently, LF Sportswear at 150 Fifth Avenue. The 9,000 square feet of ground-level retail space at the Flatiron Building is occupied by Estee Lauder and Sprint.
 The neighborhood has also been enhanced by the $5 million reconstruction of the six-acre Madison Square Park, completed in 2001. 
 Those improvements, commercial brokers said, have helped the area's office market. The vacancy rate in the Flatiron District has dropped to 13.5 percent, from 18.1 percent a year earlier. The current rate is slightly above the rate for Manhattan over all, 13.2 percent, Newmark said.
 As part of the Holtzbrinck deal, the building will be technologically updated. In recent years, its infamous water-powered elevators were replaced with electric ones. 
 Mr. Garabedian of Holtzbrinck said the building's shape offered abundant natural light that would be valued by editors. Though he conceded that his company might have been able to find less expensive office space, none could match ''the quality of space and cachet'' that came with the Flatiron Building.
 The Holtzbrinck deal comes on the heels of a lease by Rodale, a publishing company based in Emmaus, Pa., which this month expanded its operations at 733 Third Avenue at 46th Street. The company, which publishes Men's Health and Prevention magazines as well as books, including ''The South Beach Diet,'' took an additional 64,000 square feet, for a total of 113,699 square feet, to meet its growth needs, said CB Richard Ellis, which represented Rodale in the deal.

HEADLINE: Raise the Curtain, for Now, Broadway Union Declares

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY

 BODY:
After a lengthy meeting yesterday afternoon, the governing council of Actors' Equity, the actors' and stage managers' union, told its membership to continue to perform until further notice, despite a contract impasse with Broadway's producers. 
 The council, consisting of more than 70 actors and union executives, met for more than six hours at Equity's offices in the theater district as many of its members and other stage professionals wondered whether Broadway would suffer its second work stoppage in 15 months. 
 Just after 7 p.m., as some two dozen shows lifted their curtains on Broadway, the council made its terse announcement: ''The Equity Council, the governing body of Actors' Equity Association, has determined that the actors will report to the theaters on Wednesday for both performances and will continue to do so until further notice. No further information is available.'' 
 That message may have given some relief to ticket buyers and sellers, but it gave no assurances that a strike might not occur in the near future. The union, in fact, seemed to be preparing its membership for that possibility; at about 5:30 p.m., it sent out an e-mail message announcing there would be ''informational meetings'' with its membership tomorrow afternoon. It said members on the road would be patched into a separate phone conference.
 ''These meetings are being held to ensure that the members working under the Production Contract are fully informed and prepared for anything that may happen,'' the message read. ''Therefore, we are seeking your help in ensuring the attendance of your entire company.''
 The contract, which expired at midnight Sunday, covers most of the actors on Broadway and in major road shows around the country. Actors in Broadway productions produced by nonprofit companies, as well as those Off Broadway or in regional theaters, are covered by different contracts and are not in danger of striking.
 The specter of a walkout has hung over Broadway since before midnight Sunday, when talks broke down between the union and the League of American Theaters and Producers, the group representing producers and most Broadway theater owners in the talks. 
 Yesterday, Bob Chlopak, a spokesman for the League, said, ''We're very happy that Equity has decided that Broadway will continue to perform, but it is imperative that we begin to perform in negotiations as well.''
 In addition to health coverage and worker safety, a central issue is non-Equity tours, a variety of road show that uses nonunion actors to lower costs. Equity has said it is committed to limiting those tours, which have become increasingly popular with non-League producers.
 The League, meanwhile, has said that it, too, would like to limit the tours, but it is seeking concessions for tours that its members produce; in particular, the League wants to set up a tiered system in which less popular shows would pay their actors less. That idea, however, is not especially popular with the union, whose 45,000 members nationwide suffer extremely high unemployment rates and must work 20 weeks a year to qualify for a year's health coverage.
 City officials said they remained optimistic that a deal would be struck. Jonathan M. Tisch, the chairman of NYC & Company, the city's tourist and convention bureau, said that fears of a Broadway strike had not yet had any effect. 
 ''We have not had any cancellations because of a possible walkout,'' he said, adding that the city expects 10 million visitors this summer and that it expects ''a large percentage will be buying Broadway tickets.''
 But those in the theater industry and the innumerable other businesses that depend on Broadway were left to wonder what had led to the current situation. That another union was considering striking just 15 months after the musicians shut down Broadway for four days and cost the city millions of dollars in lost ticket sales and other revenues seemed almost inconceivable to many who rely on theatergoers to make the rent.
 One of those is Angus McIndoe, whose restaurant on West 44th Street is adjacent to the St. James Theater, home of ''The Producers.'' 
 ''My place costs $250,000 a month to run, so I have to have some shows up to make that happen,'' he said. ''I'm just worrying a hole in my stomach.''

HEADLINE: Powell to Press Sudan to Ease the Way for Aid in Darfur

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS

DATELINE: KHARTOUM, Sudan, June 29 

 BODY:
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said Tuesday that he would press Sudanese officials to allow international relief workers to speed up their deliveries to displaced people in the country's western Darfur region, noting that already ''thousands of people have been consigned to their deaths'' there.
 Mr. Powell, who spoke with reporters while traveling here from Istanbul, where he attended the NATO summit meeting, said he would deliver a blunt message in Khartoum that continued resistance by officials of the East African nation would jeopardize American-assisted negotiations to bring peace in a separate conflict in the south.
 ''I hope to give them a very direct message about how the United States and the international community see the horrific situation that exists in Darfur,'' Mr. Powell said. ''We need to see action promptly because people are dying, and the death rate is going to go up significantly over the next several months.'' 
 The United States Agency for International Development estimates that as many as 300,000 people are likely to die by the end of the year in Darfur. The number could be even higher, the agency says, with refugees weakened by hunger, disease and the trauma of seeing their villages destroyed in the conflict that arose last year between government-backed militias and two rebel groups. 
 On Tuesday night, Mr. Powell met briefly with President Omar Hassan Ahmed el-Bashir and Foreign Minister Mustafa Osman Ismail. Mr. Powell and his counterpart emerged from the meeting saying the talks were positive, although Mr. Ismail, as he has in the past, denied that the situation was as dire as the Americans and others have depicted.
 ''We admit there is a problem,'' Mr. Ismail said at a news conference. But, he added, ''There is no famine. There is no epidemic.''
 He acknowledged that Sudan had to come up with solutions quickly with the rainy season approaching, and with it, a number of logistical difficulties. He called for a joint plan with Washington to resolve the crisis. 
 Mr. Powell is scheduled to meet here on Wednesday with the United Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan, who will make his own fact-finding trip to Darfur on Thursday. The Bush administration is exploring whether to present a resolution to the Security Council to galvanize international attention and possibly lay out new sanctions against Sudan.
 Mr. Powell said peace talks with Christian and animist rebels in the separate, two-decade conflict in the south could unravel under the stress over Darfur. The Khartoum government is interested in striking a deal that will allow it to exploit untapped oil deposits and divide the income with southern rebels.
 ''Unless we resolve the Darfur situation and do it quickly, all that is put at risk,'' Mr. Powell told reporters traveling on his plane.
 The secretary, who has spoken frequently of the need to mobilize international support for as many as a million people displaced in Darfur, said the necessary resources to ease their plight were available or had been pledged, including food stocks and supply trucks. But as the rainy weather approaches, relief workers say, distribution will be compromised as roads become impassable.
 ''We're running out of time,'' Mr. Powell said, adding, ''Everyone recognizes the nature of the catastrophe that's on our hands.''
 The United States is by far the largest donor in the current crisis, having spent $116 million since spring 2003, said Andrew Natsios, the Agency for International Development administrator. It has pledged to spend $164 million more by the end of next year. Other countries are contributing about $125 million, he said.
 In a sign of improved American relations with Libya, which culminated with the restoration of diplomatic relations on Monday, the government of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi offered to open up a new route for relief workers to reach Darfur, Mr. Powell said.
 Mr. Powell's entourage will visit a city in Darfur that is about 40 miles from the closest village whose destruction has been documented by American officials. Aides said security concerns would keep the secretary from the zones of greatest conflict, but they said he would be fully briefed on the scope of the carnage.
 Mr. Powell's visit was added to his itinerary at the last minute, at his request. 
 The State Department estimates that the Arab militias have systematically attacked hundreds of black African villages in western Sudan and neighboring Chad, wiping out more than 300 of them. The marauders have destroyed crops, killed cattle and poisoned water supplies, according to Richard A. Boucher, the department's spokesman. 
 Mr. Powell said legal experts were still studying whether to describe the onslaught in Darfur as an act of genocide. That distinction would compel the United States and other nations to intervene as signatories to the United Nations Convention on Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide.
 The treaty defines genocide as ''acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group.''
 ''We see indications and elements that would start to move you to a genocidal conclusion,'' Mr. Powell said.
 The administration is currently describing the repression as ethnic cleansing. Mr. Powell reiterated the importance of taking action over parsing words. ''We can find a label for it later,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Playing Games With Housing

 BODY:
Congress and the Department of Housing and Urban Development have been playing a transparent game of ''good cop, bad cop'' since HUD set out to savage Section 8, the federal program that provides housing subsidies for the poor. Republicans in Congress say they budgeted enough money to underwrite the program, and they blame recalcitrant officials at HUD for the cutbacks -- while the agency, in turn, maintains that it is doing what Congress told it to do.
 Behind the game, however, both sides seem intent on squeezing money from the HUD budget to help pay for all those tax cuts for the rich, even if it means exposing thousands of poor families to the possibility of eviction. 
 Most of the families who receive subsidies under the 30-year-old Section 8 program live at or below the poverty level. They pay about 30 percent of their incomes toward rent, and government vouchers pay the rest.
 Conservative Republicans, who have long wanted to scale back the program, have usually been beaten back by their colleagues. This time around, the appropriators in Congress provided full financing for the program while quietly authorizing HUD to make cuts by administrative means. The department then announced that it would no longer pay the full cost of the vouchers, and it froze federal funds at the level of August 2003, plus an adjustment for inflation. 
 In addition, HUD's new policy involves retroactive cuts, which only became clear at the end of May, long after local housing authorities had committed themselves to helping new families, including many who had waited for years to get decent housing through the voucher program. Obviously, if cuts have to be made, the only sensible way to make them is to do so gradually and well in advance, so the local housing agencies can adjust to the new reality while preserving housing for their most vulnerable tenants.
 Faced with unexpected shortfalls, local public housing agencies have informed landlords that they can no longer pay agreed-upon rent subsidies, making it likely that many Section 8 tenants will soon be shown the door. A recent survey from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities suggests that most agencies with shortfalls will go this route. The survey also shows that local authorities have revoked newly issued vouchers and have begun to withdraw from circulation the vouchers that become available when families get better jobs and move out of the subsidy program.
 In addition, local agencies have begun to raise rents for the vulnerable families who can least afford to pay, something that is a sure way of destabilizing these families while driving them deeper into poverty.
 The Bush administration is counting on Republicans at the state level to keep quiet in the interest of party solidarity. But given the disastrous nature of the new policies, governors, state legislators and mayors of both parties have both a moral and a political obligation to speak out.

HEADLINE: Gas and Oil Bring Japanese Money to Russia's Far East

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE

DATELINE: VOSTOCHNY, Russia, June 28 

 BODY:
Far below the edge of a cavernous dry dock, hundreds of workers in orange jumpsuits and hard hats labored in a forest of steel reinforcing bars, laying the gray concrete bases for two gas- and oil-producing platforms that will soon rise 20 stories.
 ''The Japanese participation is huge,'' David J. Greer, the Sakhalin Energy Investment Company project director said on Monday, shortly before Russian officials formally inaugurated the dry dock, part of a $150 million project in this port.
 Two Japanese companies, Mitsui & Company, and the Mitsubishi Corporation, own a total of 45 percent of Sakhalin Energy. Ensuring the viability of a project that could cost $10 billion, four electricity and gas companies in Japan have signed long-term contracts to buy the liquefied natural gas from Russia.
 Japanese capital is once again crossing the Sea of Japan and investing in Russia's Far East. For much of the last decade, Japan has watched from the sidelines as China and South Korea entered Russia's resource-rich, but capital-poor Far Eastern holdings. 
 But last year, largely as the result of energy investments in Sakhalin, Japan became the largest investor nation in the region. Japan's $820 million of investments, largely in Sakhalin, dwarfed those of the nearest country, the United States with $100 million. 
 At the same time, Japanese trade with Russia jumped 42 percent last year, with Japanese exports nearly doubling.
 After getting burned during Russia's post-Soviet frontier days, many Japanese business executives redlined Russia, preferring to join the stampede into China. Now, they are taking a second look at investment opportunities here.
 ''More than 10 years ago, there were many cases of Japan investments in the Russian Far East, but there were many troubles, so Japanese companies started to withdraw,'' Toshikazu Endo, Russia policy adviser for Keidanren, or the Japan Business Federation. Fresh from leading a Keidanren business delegation last month to Khabarovsk, a major city in the region, he said, ''Russian people have started to take a second look at Japanese goods.''
 In the century since Japan beat Russia in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905, relations have been strained. The Pacific coastline of Russia bristles with fortifications built to repel a Japanese attack. But with the rise of China, Russia increasingly feels insecure about the Far East region, 36 percent of the national territory, with 5 percent of the national population.
 In a geopolitical shift with economic ramifications, the Japanese are suddenly the favored Asians in Russia's Asian half. To promote tourism and investment, governors from the region are lobbying Moscow to allow Japanese residents to visit the Far East without visas.
 On July 17, Air Vladivostok is to start a weekly flight from this city across the Sea of Japan to Tokyo, the first direct, scheduled air link between Tokyo and the Russian Far East.
 ''We have more and more Japanese delegations coming here,'' Viktor V. Gorchakov, vice governor of Primorye region for international economic development, said in Vladivostok. ''The representatives of Sumitomo, Mitsui and Mitsubishi tell us they are looking for new opportunities for expansion.''
 Dependent on the Middle East for about 85 percent of its oil consumption, Japan is seeking to diversify.
 ''Sakhalin has abundant supplies of natural gas on our doorstep,'' Toshitaka Hayakawa, president of Toho Gas, said in a statement explaining why his company became the fourth Japanese company to sign a long-term contract to buy Sakhalin gas. ''And the Sakhalin Energy L.N.G. plant will be just a few days' sailing time from us.''
 In addition to large oil and gas investments on Sakhalin -- $5 billion from Japan already -- the other product of this new economic marriage could be a 2,500-mile, $10 billion pipeline from oil deposits west of Lake Baikal to this modern port, the freight terminus for the Trans-Siberian Railway. 
 One year ago, the oil pipeline was to follow a shorter and cheaper route, to China. But the Japanese moved aggressively, offering to pay for most of the pipeline's construction cost. Today, regional leaders are Japan's best advocates in Moscow.
 ''The pipeline will be the Trans-Siberian railroad of the 21st century,'' Viktor Ishayev, governor of Khabarovsk, said on a recent visit to Japan, extolling the economic development the pipeline would bring.
 After the inauguration ceremony here, Sergei M. Darkin, governor of Vostochny's Primorye region, told reporters that his government was drawing up plans to build a petrochemical plant next to the pipeline.
 President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has yet to make an official announcement on the pipeline route, partly out of concern about offending China. 
 ''The Chinese are sort of resigned to the fact that the pipeline is not going to fly,'' Daojiong Zha, director of the Center for International Energy Security at Renmin University of Beijing, said while attending an energy conference in Japan.
 A series of Russian officials have endorsed the plan. Transneft, the Russian state oil pipeline operator, has said that it hopes to complete a feasibility study by the end of this year.
 In Moscow last week, Hatsuhisa Takashima, Japan's top foreign ministry spokesman, told reporters, ''Japan places high expectations on construction of this pipeline and exploration of east Siberian oilfields.''
 Mr. Putin may be reserving an announcement for his next visit to Tokyo, next winter. His trip is to coincide with the 150th anniversary of the signing of the first trade and friendship treaty between Russia and Japan.
 With a six-month deadline to focus their work, diplomats of both countries are working to fashion an accord over four disputed islands that Stalin seized from Japan in the closing days of World War II. The island dispute has prevented the two countries from signing a World War II peace treaty and has caused many Japanese executives to shy away from Russia.
 At the same time, Japanese companies are preparing major deals to be announced in Tokyo, hoping to wrap their projects in the powerful mantle of President Putin. 
 After the Toyota Motor Corporation tripled its car sales in Russia last year, Fujio Cho, Toyota's president, said that the company would start producing cars in Russia in the near future. Russians, bolstered by five consecutive years of economic growth, are taking a second look at Japanese goods, which are generally considered higher priced, but of better quality, than comparable goods from China or South Korea.
 Last year, the Kirin Brewery Company saw its exports of beer to Russia triple. The Nisso Boeki Company, another Japanese company, opened its first 50-ruble shop, where merchandise -- largely stationery and tableware -- sell for the equivalent of about $1.75. The company plans to open 18 more of these franchise stores.
 Taking a different tack, the CSK Venture Capital Company is moving to establish later this year Japan's first private capital for Russia. With start-up capital of about $20 million, the fund is focusing on about 20 new Russian firms in information technology.
 Despite the growth in bilateral trade, many critics note that it started at a very low level.
 ''Even though trade tends to grow, Japanese-Russian trade volumes now amount to one-twentieth of Japanese-Chinese trade and one-fortieth of trade between Japan and the United States,'' Yoriko Kawaguchi, Japan's foreign minister, said Friday at a news conference in Moscow. ''Bilateral trade has been at a relatively low level. I think this is not normal.''

HEADLINE: Big Rise in Consumer Confidence Gives a Lift to Shares

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Stocks rose yesterday after a report showed that job gains helped lift confidence in the economy to a two-year high, even as the Federal Reserve prepares to raise interest rates today. 
 ''Consumers are more confident about jobs and job-income growth,'' said Dennis Fitzpatrick, who helps manage $2.9 billion at the First Investors Management Company in New York. ''And a lot of people are coming to the conclusion that a gradual approach to increasing rates is not the death knell for equities.'' 
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 56.34 points, or 0.5 percent, to 10,413.43. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index added 2.85 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,136.20. The Nasdaq composite index climbed 15.11 points, or 0.8 percent, to 2,034.93. 
 Computer-related stocks, including Solectron and Advanced Micro Devices, led the advance amid optimism that rising borrowing costs will not deter technology spending. 
 Gains were limited by a drop in Washington Mutual after the company, a large mortgage lender, cut its full-year profit forecast. 
 Benchmark indexes jumped after a report showed that the Conference Board's consumer confidence index rose to 101.9 this month, exceeding the median economist forecast of 95 in a Bloomberg News survey. 
 Stocks also got a boost from the lowest oil prices in almost three months, said Jay Suskind, head of equity trading at Ryan Beck. 
 Fed policy makers, who began their two-day meeting yesterday, were expected to lift the benchmark lending rate today by a quarter of a percentage point, to 1.25 percent.
 ''If the language tomorrow is what we hope, we will likely get a bit of a pop'' in stocks, said Wayne Wilbanks, who manages $1 billion for Wilbanks, Smith & Thomas Asset Management in Norfolk, Va. ''Whatever the Fed says, they will be increasing interest rates and that's bad for Washington Mutual and it's bad for some companies we don't know about yet.'' 
 An index of computer-related companies contributed the most to the S.&P. 500's gain. Solectron, which makes computer parts for other companies, jumped 29 cents, to $6.27. 
 Advanced Micro Devices, Intel's biggest rival in personal computer processor chips, added 53 cents, to $15.82. 
 Flextronics International, the maker of computers and cellphones for other companies, rose 61 cents, to $15.98. The company bought factories from Nortel Networks for as much as $725 million in cash, while Nortel will buy $2.5 billion in equipment from Flextronics over four years and purchase design services under a three-year deal. 
 Washington Mutual dropped $2.84, or 6.9 percent, to $38.47 and was the biggest drag in the S.&P. 500 after sharply cutting its 2004 forecast. 
 The company said it expected earnings per share this year of $3 to $3.60, trailing the average analyst estimate of $4.24. Washington Mutual said its mortgage-banking business might lose money this year. Home-loan volume and the profit it makes from selling mortgages are below its expectations. 
 Countrywide Financial, another mortgage lender, shed $2.18, to $69.32. 
 Retailers dropped even with the higher consumer confidence reading after Target said sales for June at stores open for more than a year will be ''well below'' its estimate. Target, which is the second-largest discount retailer, lost $1.75, to $42.29. It had previously forecast an increase of 5 percent to 7 percent. 
 Wal-Mart Stores, which lowered its June sales forecast Monday, fell 48 cents, to $51.98.

	 	 		--------------------	 	

Treasury Prices Climb
 (By Reuters) -- Treasury prices rose yesterday despite a jump in consumer confidence that reflected lower gasoline costs and improved job prospects. 
 The 10-year Treasury note gained 12/32, to a price of 10016/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 4.69 percent from 4.73 percent on Monday.
 The price of the 30-year Treasury bond climbed 20/32, to 1004/32. The bond's yield dropped to 5.36 percent from 5.41 percent on Monday.
 Following are the results of the auction of four-week bills:

HEADLINE: Investigators Say Drug Makers Repeatedly Overcharged

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 29 

 BODY:
Federal investigators said Tuesday that drug companies had repeatedly overcharged public hospitals and clinics for low-income patients, making them pay more than the maximum prices allowed by federal law.
 Such taxpayer-supported hospitals, community health centers and clinics for people with AIDS are supposed to have access to the government's best prices for outpatient drugs.
 The investigators, at the inspector general's office in the Health and Human Services Department, found that prices charged to those agencies frequently exceeded the limits set by the Public Health Service Act. In one month, the investigators said, the overcharges totaled $41.1 million, raising the cost of prescription drugs to public hospitals and clinics 18 percent, to $269 million, from $227.9 million. 
 In 31 percent of the transactions examined, the prices charged by drug manufacturers exceeded the legal maximums, the investigators said. Thirty-six of 37 health care providers had to pay more than the ceiling price defined by Congress.
 The size of the discount program and the overcharges are growing, in part because President Bush and Congress are engaged in a major bipartisan effort to increase community health centers for low-income patients. Those clinics are all entitled to the discounts.
 The inspector general said the Public Health Service should develop a legislative proposal to establish fines and civil penalties for manufacturers that overcharge. 
 ''In effect,'' the report said, ''no penalties exist for manufacturers that violate the terms of the Public Health Service Act.''
 If the government detects evidence of overcharges, ''it does not have the legislative, regulatory or contractual authority to effectively remedy the situation,'' George F. Grob, an assistant deputy inspector general, said. If the hospitals and clinics are not overcharged, Mr. Grob said, they could ''serve more patients and improve the quality of service.''
 The Bush administration said that it ''concurs with the overall findings in the report'' and would try to monitor drug prices more closely. But it said it did not want to ask Congress for authority to impose fines and other penalties on drug companies.
 Elizabeth M. James Duke, administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration, which runs the discount program, said her agency did ''not support the development of a specific legislative proposal at this time'' and ''prefers to continue exploring its options.''
 The inspector general said Ms. Duke's agency had ''no protocol to ensure that entities'' like hospitals and clinics ''receive the appropriate discount.'' Moreover, the report said, the health resources agency does not audit manufacturers to see whether they have overcharged. 
 Congress created the discount program in 1992 under Section 340B of the Public Health Service Act. More than 10,500 agencies participate. Together, they serve more than 10 million people and spent a total of $3.4 billion on outpatient drugs last year.
 Among the agencies entitled to discounts are Cook County Hospital in Chicago, the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation, Parkland Hospital in Dallas and San Francisco General Hospital. The discounts are also available to many state university hospitals, private nonprofit hospitals that have contracts with state and local governments, certain school-based health programs, family planning clinics and clinics that serve homeless people, migrant farm workers and people with sexually transmitted diseases, hemophilia or tuberculosis. 
 Under the program, public hospitals and clinics receive a minimum discount of about 15 percent off the manufacturer's price for brand-name drugs, and they are entitled to additional discounts if a drug's price has risen faster than inflation. On average, the prices are 20 to 25 percent lower than what hospitals can find through other programs.
 William H. von Oehsen, general counsel for the Public Hospital Pharmacy Coalition, which represents hospitals in the program, said they had long suspected overcharges. 
 ''Now,'' Mr. von Oehsen said, ''for the first time, we have independent corroboration that our suspicions were correct.''
 He added that the report showed an urgent need for action. The government should require drug companies to issue refunds when overcharges are found, he said, and public hospitals and clinics should be allowed to sue manufacturers to recover overpayments.
 Senator Jeff Bingaman, Democrat of New Mexico, said he was developing legislation to make sure that hospitals and clinics received the discounts they were supposed to. 
 ''We have a responsibility to taxpayers, who ultimately pay the cost,'' Mr. Bingaman said.
 Diana L. Bond, pharmacy director at University Medical Center in Las Vegas, a public hospital, said she was distressed about the new findings. 
 ''We have benefited from this program,'' Ms. Bond said. ''But we have no way of knowing what prices we're supposed to receive. That's confidential information held by the federal government and the drug companies. We have to trust the government to monitor prices.''
 David C. Hammond, a lawyer in Washington who represents manufacturers, took issue with some of the findings. The report suggests that drug companies were responsible for the overcharges, Mr. Hammond said, but errors and markups by wholesalers and other middlemen could have also been a factor.
 ''The report does not identify the root cause of the overpricing,'' he said.
 Court Rosen, a spokesman for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, a trade group, said he could not comment on his members' pricing policies.

HEADLINE: Courting Minorities, Kerry Promises Expanded College Access

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER; Jodi Wilgoren contributed reporting from Chicago for this article.

DATELINE: PHOENIX, June 29 

 BODY:
Hoping to energize minority voters, Senator John Kerry promised blacks and Hispanics on Tuesday that he would expand access to college, and he delivered a forceful new answer to Republican charges that he is running a campaign of pessimism.
 ''This administration says this is the best economy of our lifetime,'' he told the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition in Chicago. ''They say this is the best that we can do. They've even called us pessimists because we dared to tell the truth about the people without health care'' and about shortcomings in the Bush administration's education and prescription-drug initiatives, he said. 
 ''Well, I say, the most pessimistic thing that you can say is that we can't do better in the United States of America,'' Mr. Kerry continued, trying out a new rhetorical riff.
 The Rainbow/PUSH gathering was the same event where, in June 1992, Bill Clinton infuriated the Rev. Jesse Jackson, the group's leader, by questioning why the rap artist Sister Souljah had been invited to speak after making remarks about killing white people. 
 By contrast, Mr. Kerry said nothing to antagonize his hosts. In a race where both parties are seeking to energize their base, he is courting the same strong minority support that Mr. Clinton and Al Gore enjoyed but has been criticized for not having enough minority representation in senior positions in his campaign.
 On Saturday, after Mr. Kerry spoke to the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials, its director, Arturo Vargas, repeated that complaint, saying, ''I don't think either campaign has done well enough to date, frankly.'' On Tuesday, Mr. Kerry had two recent African-American hires along for the trip: Terry Edmonds, his director of speechwriting, who held the same job in the Clinton White House, and Brian Burke, a domestic policy adviser. Later in Phoenix, he named Jose Villareal, a San Antonio lawyer who is chairman of La Raza, a leading Hispanic group, as a national co-chairman of his campaign.
 In his Chicago speech, Mr. Kerry worked hard to assure the Rainbow/PUSH audience that he was sincere.
 ''I'm wary about standing up in front of you,'' he said, ''because I know there's a cynicism. I know you're tired of the words. So am I.''
 He said he understood that many blacks believed politicians listened to them only in election years. ''What happens afterwards?'' he asked. ''They sort of feel they disappear. Broken promises have been broken so often, it's hard for people to summon up that inside, psychic energy necessary to go out and make a difference.
 ''Let me tell you something: People are different in this business,'' he said. ''There are some of us who keep our word.''
 He said he could do more than Mr. Bush on the economy and education.
 ''Don't tell us that two million lost jobs is the best we can do,'' he said. ''Don't tell us overcrowded schools and underpaid teachers are the best that we can do. We can do better -- and we will.''
 Mr. Kerry also recalled the disputed 2000 presidential election: ''And don't tell us that it is the best we can do when in the last election, two million votes weren't even counted,'' he said. ''Don't tell us that people who are harassed and intimidated from going to the polls, something we thought we resolved in the 1960's, and it still happens in the dawn of the 21st century; don't tell us that.
 ''We can do better, and we will do better this time,'' he said, bringing most of the crowd to its feet. 
 Mr. Kerry used the Chicago speech, and one later in Phoenix at the convention of the National Council of La Raza, to unveil proposals to help educate more highly skilled workers, particularly in the sciences, and to increase the rate at which all students, but especially minorities and women, graduate from college.
 ''In an era when college graduates will earn $900,000 more than high school graduates over the course of a career,'' he said, ''less than a third of all Americans have a four-year college degree, and less than a fifth of all African-Americans do.'' 
 He promised to spend $300 million to encourage girls and members of minority groups to study science and math in programs like all-girls math and science schools and to double the $95 million budgeted for National Science Foundation graduate scholarships. Mr. Kerry also said he would require colleges to report annual figures on the number of minority, low-income and middle-income students enrolling and graduating, and make available $100 million in incentives to colleges that raise graduation rates of low-income students receiving Pell Grants.
 He said he would provide $10 billion in federal relief for states that commit to keep their college tuition increases at or below the rate of inflation for two years. He said he would pay for the programs using $30 billion raised by auctioning off more of the broadcast spectrum for digital television and other broadband wireless services.
 A spokesman for the Bush-Cheney campaign, Steve Schmidt, pointed to a USA Today article on Monday saying increases in financial aid had reduced tuition costs in recent years. ''Kerry's cynical attacks are at odds with the facts that more Americans have college degrees than ever before and the amount students pay in tuition costs is down by a third since 1998,'' he said.
 Mr. Jackson said Mr. Kerry had hit a nerve by citing the Florida recount, the Bush administration's efforts to roll back overtime rules and the Supreme Court's conservative makeup.
 ''You can't compare Kerry with Clinton,'' said Mr. Jackson, who noted that President Bush had failed to meet with civil rights groups. ''Compare him with Bush. It's a closed-door policy. So if he speaks of Supreme Court justices who are fair and open, he speaks of workers' right to organize, he is coming right down the center of it.''
 Mr. Kerry's listeners in Chicago praised him but said his 50-minute speech was taxing. James Thomas of Detroit, who sells insurance and investments, said Mr. Kerry ''actually sold me on him.''
 ''I just feel like Kerry was speaking from his heart,'' Mr. Thomas said.
 Debra Calloway Davis, a sergeant in the Cook County Sheriff's Department, said she liked Mr. Kerry's focus on health care, education and jobs but said he was ''very long-winded.''
 ''Sometimes we have to get behind people,'' she said. ''Until he's eaten at my table, per se, he does not know my issues. But he's starting to eat at my table.''

	 	 		--------------------	 	

Kerry Won't Release Records
 PHOENIX, June 29 (AP) -- Senator Kerry said Tuesday in an interview that he would not release his divorce records. ''There's no reason whatsoever,'' he said in an interview with the Spanish-language broadcaster Telemundo in a campaign stop in Phoenix. Mr. Kerry said he and his former wife, Julia Thorne, were ''terrific friends.''

HEADLINE: Calling Bush A Liar

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF. 
E-mail: nicholas@nytimes.com

 BODY:
So is President Bush a liar?
 Plenty of Americans think so. Bookshops are filled with titles about Mr. Bush like ''Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them,'' ''Big Lies,'' ''Thieves in High Places'' and ''The Lies of George W. Bush.'' 
 A consensus is emerging on the left that Mr. Bush is fundamentally dishonest, perhaps even evil -- a nut, yes, but mostly a liar and a schemer. That view is at the heart of Michael Moore's scathing new documentary, ''Farenheit 9/11.''
 In the 1990's, nothing made conservatives look more petty and simple-minded than their demonization of Bill and Hillary Clinton, who were even accused of spending their spare time killing Vince Foster and others. Mr. Clinton, in other words, left the right wing addled. Now Mr. Bush is doing the same to the left. For example, Mr. Moore hints that the real reason Mr. Bush invaded Afghanistan was to give his cronies a chance to profit by building an oil pipeline there.
 ''I'm just raising what I think is a legitimate question,'' Mr. Moore told me, a touch defensively, adding, ''I'm just posing a question.''
 Right. And right-wing nuts were ''just posing a question'' about whether Mr. Clinton was a serial killer.
 I'm against the ''liar'' label for two reasons. First, it further polarizes the political cesspool, and this polarization is making America increasingly difficult to govern. Second, insults and rage impede understanding. 
 Lefties have been asking me whether Mr. Bush has already captured Osama bin Laden, and whether Mr. Bush will plant W.M.D. in Iraq. Those are the questions of a conspiracy theorist, for even if officials wanted to pull such stunts, they would be daunted by the fear of leaks.
 Bob Woodward's latest book underscores that Mr. Bush actually believed that Saddam did have W.M.D. After one briefing, Mr. Bush turned to George Tenet and protested, ''I've been told all this intelligence about having W.M.D., and this is the best we've got?'' The same book also reports that Mr. Bush told Mr. Tenet several times, ''Make sure no one stretches to make our case.''
 In fact, of course, Mr. Bush did stretch the truth. The run-up to Iraq was all about exaggerations, but not flat-out lies. Indeed, there's some evidence that Mr. Bush carefully avoids the most blatant lies -- witness his meticulous descriptions of the periods in which he did not use illegal drugs.
 True, Mr. Bush boasted that he doesn't normally read newspaper articles, when his wife said he does. And Mr. Bush wrongly claimed that he was watching on television on the morning of 9/11 as the first airplane hit the World Trade Center. But considering the odd things the president often says (''I know how hard it is for you to put food on your family''), Mr. Bush always has available a prima facie defense of confusion. 
 Mr. Bush's central problem is not that he was lying about Iraq, but that he was overzealous and self-deluded. He surrounded himself with like-minded ideologues, and they all told one another that Saddam was a mortal threat to us. They deceived themselves along with the public -- a more common problem in government than flat-out lying.
 Some Democrats, like Mr. Clinton and Senator Joseph Lieberman, have pushed back against the impulse to demonize Mr. Bush. I salute them, for there are so many legitimate criticisms we can (and should) make about this president that we don't need to get into kindergarten epithets.
 But the rush to sling mud is gaining momentum, and ''Farenheit 9/11'' marks the polarization of yet another form of media. One medium after another has found it profitable to turn from information to entertainment, from nuance to table-thumping.
 Talk radio pioneered this strategy, then cable television. Political books have lately become as subtle as professional wrestling, and the Internet is adding to the polarization. Now, with the economic success of ''Farenheit 9/11,'' look for more documentaries that shriek rather than explain.
 It wasn't surprising when the right foamed at the mouth during the Clinton years, for conservatives have always been quick to detect evil empires. But liberals love subtlety and describe the world in a palette of grays -- yet many have now dropped all nuance about this president. 
 Mr. Bush got us into a mess by overdosing on moral clarity and self-righteousness, and embracing conspiracy theories of like-minded zealots. How sad that many liberals now seem intent on making the same mistakes.

HEADLINE: Fed's Expected Rate RiseMay Well Offer a Respite For Other Central Banks

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, June 29 

 BODY:
When the Federal Reserve raises interest rates from the lowest level in more than four decades, a move expected on Wednesday, the news will flash through trading floors and finance ministries overseas with the same fanfare as in the United States.
 Given the vast influence that American monetary policy exerts on the rest of the world, central bankers from Frankfurt to Tokyo will face the question of how best to adapt their own policies to the Fed's new stance. For most, the answer will be not at all, at least in the short run.
 By starting its campaign to wean Americans off a diet of easy money, the Fed will, in fact, ease the pressure on other central bankers. Most will happily accept the favor. 
 A Fed move would narrow the gap in interest rates between the United States and the 12 nations using the euro currency, and could stabilize the dollar and take the steam out of the euro, one of Europe's more frustrating recent economic problems. 
 ''Alan Greenspan will get a lot of applause in Frankfurt,'' said Holger Schmieding, an economist at Bank of America in London. ''The U.S. is reducing the risk of what Europe fears most.''
 That makes it easier for Jean-Claude Trichet and other leaders of the European Central Bank, which meets here on Thursday, a day after the Fed, to leave its key short-term rate unchanged at 2 percent. 
 The Bank of Japan and other Asian central banks are not likely to budge, either. Even in China, where the sizzling economy makes the case for a rate increase the strongest, officials may balk at following the Federal Reserve's move with their own.
 The Bank of England may feel no need to follow the Fed because it got there first, with rate increases in November and February intended to rein in inflation. Critics say the Fed has been less a trailblazer than a slowpoke. 
 ''The Fed is still the cornerstone,'' said Norbert Walter, chief economist of Deutsche Bank, who views the rate increase expected Wednesday as overdue. ''But you don't always need to follow the cornerstone.''
 The reluctance in Europe to raise interest rates stems in part from the mixed signals the economy has been sending. With worries about inflation popping up one week, followed by worries about a relapse of German economic stagnation the next, standing pat seems the wisest course to bankers here.
 Though it has tempered recently, the rise in the value of the euro against the dollar has fed fears that European exports will be priced out of foreign markets, stalling economic recovery. Earlier in the year, the European Central Bank resisted intense pressure to cut rates, which are at their lowest since World War II. 
 A dollar that is stable rather than sinking would also be a big help to central banks in Japan and Southeast Asia, reducing the need for them to intervene in foreign exchange markets to keep their currencies from strengthening too much. As major exporters to the United States, these Asian countries worry about losing their competitive advantage, especially to China, whose currency is linked to the dollar. 
 Booming exports have helped them grow robustly. As in Europe, though, the humming export machine is not always matched by strong domestic consumption.
 Inflation is of less concern in Asia, especially in Japan, where deflation has presented real worries. But higher interest rates in the United States may reduce the demand for goods exported from Japan and elsewhere in Asia in the coming months, which would slow those economies.
 Faced with these factors, few economists expect the Japanese central bank to deviate from its policy of keeping short-term rates close to zero, although they do not rule out the possibility that countries like Indonesia that have experienced some inflation may in time have to follow a Fed move, perhaps a few months from now. 
 ''We have no problem in Asia because we have large current account and trade surpluses,'' said Marc Faber, a money manager based in Hong Kong. ''We don't have the bubbles we had in the 1990's.''
 China, though, is a special case. With torrid economic growth, exploding credit and mounting inflation, it has been nurturing a potentially treacherous economic bubble, in the view of many economists. 
 The Chinese government has had some success tamping down the growth rate by cutting back the supply of credit using measures like higher reserve requirements for banks. Still, some economists argue that unless China raises interest rates, too, it will leave the door open to future bubbles. With inflation of at least 5 percent, and interest on savings deposits just 0.8 percent, the environment remains ripe for overinvestment, particularly in real estate.
 ''While it may take a while, China must increase rates as the Fed does,'' Andy Xie, the China economist at Morgan Stanley in Hong Kong, said in a note to clients. ''Otherwise, China would face a liquidity shortage, leading to a black market for credit and destabilizing the economy.''
 The notion of higher interest rates has met resistance in China -- in part because of the upward pressure that it would put on China's currency, the yuan, which is linked to the dollar at a rate that is widely to be considered artificially low.
 But just as a rate increase by the Federal Reserve might help Europeans by shoring up the dollar against the euro, it could also help the Chinese by making it easier for them to allow their currency to drift upward.
 ''China needs to tighten,'' said Dong Tao, an economist at Credit Suisse in Hong Kong. ''Now, with the Fed tightening,'' and the yuan's value tied the dollar's, ''they can move on interest rates as well.''
 Other analysts of China are more skeptical, noting that interest rates there mean little in a economy where much lending is still done on the basis of personal and political connections rather than creditworthiness.
 ''The reality is that China is going to use administrative and quantitative methods to cool down its economy,'' rather than changing rates, said Simon Ogus, chairman of DSG, an investment research firm in Hong Kong. ''The irony of China tightening is that the worst guys would continue to get credit.''
 If China is still at risk of overheating, Europe remains fearful that it will go cold. The Continent's recovery is now basically on track, most economists say, with growth expected to reach 2 percent this year. Yet there are occasional wobbles, like the most recent Ifo Institute survey in Germany, which recorded an unexpected plunge in business confidence in June. 
 Mr. Schmieding argued that the survey reflected temporary concerns about the spike in oil prices, although retail sales and broader consumer spending in Germany also remain weak. ''I would take it as a sign that the European recovery is fragile,'' he said. ''This will make the E.C.B. very cautious.''
 The program of rate moves that some Fed watchers expect -- four increases of one-quarter point each between now and the end of the year -- would suit the European Central Bank fine, according to Ulrich Ramm, chief economist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt. By December, he said, benchmark short-term interest rates in Europe and the United States will have converged at 2 percent, and the Europeans can then act.
 A move by the Federal Reserve on Wednesday may yet kick off a round of ''global monetary tightening,'' as Goldman Sachs declared in a new report. But for Europe, it said, this will be a quiet summer.

HEADLINE: PATAKI ASKS BUSH FOR CITY RAIL AID

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 29 

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki has asked President Bush to allow New York to use billions of dollars in unspent Sept. 11 aid to build a rail link connecting the former World Trade Center site to the Long Island Rail Road and Kennedy International Airport, according to the governor's aides.
 In a rare direct appeal to the president, Mr. Pataki urged Mr. Bush, a fellow Republican, to provide cash in place of unused parts of a $5 billion tax-incentive package that Washington allocated to help spur construction of new office towers, residential buildings and retail shops in Lower Manhattan. 
 Mr. Pataki has yet to specify the precise amount that he is seeking from the federal government. But his aides say that he may ask the president and Congress to convert about $2 billion in unused tax breaks into hard cash for the $6 billion project. The money, if approved, would provide significant financing for the rail link, which has been promoted by the governor as a way to reinvigorate downtown while solving the riddle of providing direct access to the airport from Manhattan.
 The tax breaks the governor wants to forsake, known as the Liberty Zone package, have been controverial from their inception, with some New York politicians, economists and real estate experts questioning their value and arguing that Lower Manhattan has been in desperate need of a large infusion of actual dollars from the federal government.
 In a letter sent to Mr. Bush on Monday, Mr. Pataki said that he and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg ''would like to work with your administration to determine if and exactly how much of the unused tax package is available'' to be converted into cash to pay for the rail link and other revitalization projects in Lower Manhattan.''
 ''The proposed Long Island and J.F.K. rail service will help re-attract tens of thousands of jobs lost after September 11th and will result in growth across the metropolitan region,'' the governor said in the letter. ''Redeploying these untapped federal funds will contribute substantially to the revitalization of Lower Manhattan and the broader area.''
 The Bloomberg administration's representatives did not respond to a request on Tuesday for a comment on the governor's proposal.
 Politically, the timing of Mr. Pataki's request is intriguing, coming two months before national Republicans gather in New York City to nominate Mr. Bush in a party convention that is scheduled to coincide roughly with the third anniversary of the Sept. 11 attack.
 As one of the main hosts of the event, Mr. Pataki appears to have some leverage with the White House, though the governor's aides dismissed such assertions, saying that the president had already been extremely helpful in New York's recovery effort. The governor has also been a major fund-raiser for the president, traveling the country in recent months on his campaign's behalf.
 On Tuesday night, the White House indicated that it was open to Mr. Pataki's proposal.
 ''We are receptive to the governor's idea of redeploying unused tax incentives to support the redevelopment of Lower Manhattan,'' said Claire Buchan, a White House spokeswoman. ''We are working with the governor's office, the mayor's office and the Congress on the specifics.''
 In May, Mr. Pataki first announced that he would throw his support behind a plan to dig a new tunnel under the East River as part of a rail link from downtown to Kennedy Airport and points east along the Long Island Rail Road. It would, among other things, greatly expand the ability of businesses in the financial district to attract workers from Long Island who now have to take both the city subway and suburban rail lines to get downtown.
 In his letter to the president, Mr. Pataki said the rail link would both accommodate as many as 100,000 Long Island commuters each day and ''offer a one-seat ride from downtown to J.F.K. Airport.''
 ''The critical new rail line would provide Lower Manhattan with dramatically improved access to one of the region's most important labor pools and the region's premier international gateway,'' the letter said.
 The project envisioned by the governor would be completed in 2013. It would allow travelers heading downtown from Kennedy Airport to begin their trip on existing AirTrain tracks that loop around the central terminal area and then along a viaduct in the middle of the Van Wyck Expressway to Jamaica, Queens.
 There, a new 1,500-foot elevated connector would carry the train from the AirTrain tracks to the existing Long Island Rail Road tracks heading toward Brooklyn.
 Just before the Atlantic Terminal, and joined to it through a new underground station, the three-mile tunnel would begin. It would burrow under Brooklyn and the East River into Lower Manhattan. The tunnel would come close to Hanover Square, the intended terminus of the Second Avenue subway, and the World Trade Center, the existing terminus of the E train.
 Mr. Pataki said in his letter to Mr. Bush that financing for the $6 billion project would include at least $560 million from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and unspecified amounts from the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and other sources.
 The Liberty Zone tax-incentive package that the governor is seeking to convert to cash has long been one of the biggest question marks in the $21.4 billion that the president and Congress pledged to aid New York's recovery from the Sept. 11 attack, which destroyed the trade center and killed more than 2,800 people.
 A host of New York politicians in both parties have called into question the actual value of the Liberty Zone tax breaks. In 2002, for example, the Bloomberg administration commissioned a report that concluded the tax benefits were worth less than $3.8 billion, not the $5.029 billion projected by federal officials.
 Beyond that, some state and city officials say the package was an ill-conceived way of addressing the damage that was done to the city's economy by the terrorist attack. The value of the tax breaks, they say, is entirely dependent upon the willingness of people to invest in office buildings and other business opportunities at a time when the future of downtown, and especially the market for office space, is in serious doubt.

HEADLINE: Reality Intrudes on Promises in Rebuilding of Iraq

BYLINE: By JAMES GLANZ and ERIK ECKHOLM; James Glanz reported from Baghdad for this article, and Erik Eckholm from Washington and New York.

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, June 29 

 BODY:
The four big smokestacks at the Doura power plant in Baghdad have always served as subversive truth-tellers. No matter what Saddam Hussein's propagandists said about electricity supplies, people knew they could get a better idea of the coming day's power by counting how many stacks at Doura were spewing smoke.
 Mr. Hussein is vanquished and a new Iraqi government has just gained formal sovereignty, but those smokestacks remain potent markers -- not only of sporadic electricity service but of the agonizingly slow pace of Iraq's promised economic renewal.
 More than a year into an aid effort that American officials likened to the Marshall Plan, occupation authorities acknowledge that fewer than 140 of 2,300 promised construction projects are under way. Only three months after L. Paul Bremer III, the American administrator who departed Monday, pledged that 50,000 Iraqis would find jobs at construction sites before the formal transfer of sovereignty, fewer than 20,000 local workers are employed. 
 Inside the high-profile Doura plant, American-financed repairs, originally scheduled to be completed by June 1, have dragged into the summer even as the demand for electricity soars and residents suffer through nightly power failures.
 At the same time, an economy that is supposed to become a beacon of free enterprise remains warped by central controls and huge subsidies for energy and food, leaving politically explosive policy choices for the fledgling Iraqi government.
 While the interim government has formally taken office, the reconstruction effort -- involving everything from building electric and sewage plants to training police officers and judges -- is only beginning. 
 Scrambling to speed up the process, the Pentagon has recently begun pumping out long-awaited money and work orders, committing $1.4 billion in just the last week even as a spreading insurgency cripples the ability of Western contractors to oversee their projects and has made targets of Iraqi workers.
 American authorities, while admitting to a slow start and more aware than anyone of the security threat, insist that the rebuilding will proceed. ''Some of the power plants may get blown up,'' David J. Nash, the retired rear admiral who directs the American building program, said in an interview last week. ''But we're not going to stop.''
 Of the $9 billion in contracts the Pentagon has issued so far, only $5.2 billion has actually been nailed down for defined tasks. Most of those projects are still in planning stages, though officials insist that the rebuilding effort will soon flower.
 From the outset the designing of projects and awarding of billions of dollars in contracts proved slower than some officials had imagined. 
 Among other things, planning, oversight and competitive procedures were tightened after some of the earliest postwar contracts, awarded without competition to companies including Halliburton, were tainted by evidence of waste and overcharging.
 But even more, the glowing economic promises met the realities of Iraq. Decades of neglect, sanctions and war left the country's physical infrastructure in far worse condition than many expected. And as an anti-American uprising gained force, the reconstruction effort became a prime target, with oil pipes and power lines blown up as soon as they were repaired and Iraqi workers put in fear of retribution.
 From the start, refurbishing Iraq's dismal infrastructure and creating a thriving market economy were promoted by Bush administration officials as pillars of the American-led invasion -- ''the perfect complement to Iraq's political transformation,'' in the words of Mr. Bremer.
 But more than a year later, supplies of electricity and water are no better for most Iraqis, and in some cases are worse, than they were before the invasion in the spring of 2003. 
 Repairs of three giant wastewater treatment plants in Baghdad, for example, are weeks or months behind, while water supply systems in the south of the country are months or even years away from functioning properly. Unrepaired bridges continue to create monstrous bottlenecks in many parts of the country.
 For Iraqis, the delays have bred frustration and anger. Recent interviews in the upscale Baghdad neighborhood of Harethiya suggest that the electricity woes have, among other things, created a nation of insomniacs, sweltering in their apartments through oppressive nights.
 ''We are so tired because of the electricity,'' said Abdul Razzaq, owner of a sundries shop, who said that to top it off, business was down so much that it was hard to pay for private generators.
 Just down the street, Samir Ibraheem said security problems forced him to close his shop, which has good air-conditioning, early each night. ''The problem is at my house, when I sleep at night,'' he said.
 In less prosperous areas, sorry infrastructure is even more dispiriting. On Sunday a local paper reported that new sewage flooding in five poorer neighborhoods of eastern and western Baghdad was raising serious fears of disease.
 Mais Khalid, 20, a student at Baghdad University who lives with her family in Al Elfain, a neighborhood in the southwestern part of the city, said a river of sewage entered her home whenever the door was opened. She traces the problem to a lack of electricity to run the pumps that keep sewer lines clear.
 In perhaps the greatest technical success, oil exports have been restored to their prewar levels, bringing in money that will pay the national budget. But attacks shut down pipelines in the last two weeks, and exports are only partly restored. 
 One clear improvement is in telephone service, but an annoying patchwork system does not allow mobile phones from one part of the country to communicate easily with those in other parts.
 The rebuilding effort is supposed to receive a total of some $24 billion in American grants and eventually some $13 billion in international loans. The United States military has already dispensed several additional billions, from oil revenue and seized Iraqi assets, for emergency repairs and small community projects such as renovating schools.
 The bulk of the aid was provided in a special Congressional appropriation last fall of $18.4 billion in grant money. Three months ago, mindful of rising Iraqi frustration over the slow pace of change, Mr. Bremer made lavish promises that have only partly been met.
 ''Now the contracts are signed, and in the coming weeks the dirt will begin to fly on construction jobs all over Iraq,'' he announced on March 29. By the end of June, he said, ''50,000 Iraqis will be working on jobs funded by the partnership for prosperity. But this is just the beginning.''
 But by this week, only about half of the $18.4 billion had been allocated to contractors, and little of the work was visible.
 Construction has been debilitated by bombings and shootings of Western contractors and Iraqi workers, shortages of materials and poor planning. Many contractors have recently had to devote 20 percent or more of their money to armed security instead of building materials and to curb their oversight of subcontractors in the field, even evacuating workers for long stretches.
 Because of safety fears, the last Western engineers fled the Doura plant a week ago, leaving disassembled machines on the enormous plant floor. The engineers were from the Siemens Company of Germany, working on a subcontract with American financing.
 ''They didn't contact me,'' said Bashir Khalif Omir, the plant's director. ''They took their luggage at midnight and they left.''
 But the transfer of sovereignty has given Mr. Omir new hopes. Because Iraqis now ultimately call the shots on the work, Mr. Omir said, insurgents will no longer have so much reason to attack building projects and their workers.
 Whether the rebels will make this distinction remains to be seen. In the meantime, the transfer opens new uncertainties. Will the new Iraqi government alter spending priorities, and how much power will it exert over American money? Will corruption rise as Iraqi ministries assert more influence on the subcontracting of American billions?
 Will American decision-making be crippled by bureaucratic rivalries as the State Department takes over many functions from the Pentagon?
 The construction office that Admiral Nash heads, until now a strictly Pentagon operation, has been split into two entities, a strategy office reporting to State and an implementing one reporting to the Defense Department. Admiral Nash has been appointed head of both.
 ''We're still a little unclear about who we will have to interface with on a daily basis,'' said James Cartner, vice president for Iraq operations for Fluor, a major contractor.
 On the broader question of reshaping Iraq's economy, the occupation made limited progress but left some of the most politically tough decisions to the Iraqis. 
 The new government will inherit a new currency, a renewed banking system and, in measures that were pushed hard by a conservative Republican administration, low taxes and tariffs and a law permitting unhindered foreign investment in non-oil sectors of the economy.
 But American officials, fearful of fanning more unrest, put off what economists say are crucial steps toward a functioning market economy and an end to rampant smuggling. They have not carried out plans to phase out Iraq's huge subsidies for fuel and electricity and to end the dependency of a majority of Iraqis on handouts of imported food.
 ''It's hard to make the economy start working with such irrational prices,'' said Keith Crane, an economist at the RAND Corporation who advised the Coalition Provisional Authority last year. ''And in the long run it doesn't make sense to build refineries so they can sell gas for three cents a liter.''
 The insurgency has been an obvious source of construction delays. But critics, including some Americans who spent frustrating months in Baghdad, also say the Pentagon's approach to economic restoration was flawed from the outset -- seen too much as a bricks and mortar task and in isolation from the country's political and social wounds.
 In the initial months of the American occupation, the hard-earned lessons of earlier nation-building campaigns by the United States and the United Nations in places like Bosnia, Afghanistan and East Timor were ignored by Pentagon planners, who tried to rush ahead with showcase infrastructure projects before securing public safety and a sense of participation, critics say.
 ''We mostly did what we know how to do, instead of what needed to be done,'' said James Dobbins, a retired diplomat who led American recovery efforts in Afghanistan, Kosovo, Bosnia and elsewhere and said it was a mistake to put the Pentagon in charge of Iraq's economy. ''That's what the Army Corps of Engineers does: it hires multinational corporations to build infrastructure.''
 Critics like Mr. Dobbins, who has not worked in Iraq but was President Bush's envoy to Afghanistan after the American invasion there, say many of the problems should have been foreseen.
 ''What the Iraqis needed was security, and with that they could get their electricity back on themselves,'' said Mr. Dobbins, who is now with the Rand Corporation and is chief author of a 2003 study, ''America's Role in Nation-Building From Germany to Iraq.''
