Suit Is Settled by Salomon

 BODY:
Salomon Brothers Inc. agreed yesterday to pay $15 million to the State of West Virginia to settle a lawsuit that charged the firm with securities fraud.
 Lawyers for West Virginia contended that Salomon had improperly allowed the state's investment fund to pursue a risky trading strategy from 1985 through 1988 in violation of state law. 
The strategy, which resulted in hundreds of millions of dollars in losses in 1987, involved the purchase and rapid turnover of Treasury notes in the investment fund for West Virginia. The strategy essentially involved a bet on interest rates, which rose sharply in 1987.
The investments were made with the agreement of the state's Treasurer, A. James Manchin, who was forced to resign in mid-1989 because of the scandal stemming from the investment. The fund lost $231 million more in 1987 than it was reporting, a fact not uncovered until an audit in 1988.
 A number of other firms, including Merrill Lynch & Company and Shearson Lehman Brothers, have already settled similar charges with the state. The total amount that the state has received in settlements is $20 million.
 In a statement, Salomon said that it was not admitting any liability in the case. "Salomon concluded that it would be prudent to settle the matter to avoid the risk and further expense of litigation," the statement said.

HEADLINE: Unemployment Claims in Jump

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 21

 BODY:
The number of people filing new claims for unemployment benefits shot up to an eight-year high of 519,000 in the week ending March 9, the Government said today.
 The Labor Department said initial claims rose by 45,000 from the previous week, hitting the highest level since the 546,000 filed during the first week of January 1983, at the end of the last recession. 
Private economists said the report on jobless claims was not an encouraging sign that the current recession would be short and mild.
 "This suggests that more people are being laid off and it signifies a continuing weakening of the economy," said Samuel Kahan, chief economist at Fuji Securities Inc. in Chicago. Mr. Kahan cautioned that the initial jobless claims report could be volatile from week to week. But he noted that the four-week average for claims has been moving higher since December.
 The new jobless claims report was viewed as especially worrisome because it provided one of the first looks at how the economy was performing in March. Some economists said they expected the broader jobless report for the month, to be issued April 5, to show another turn for the worse.
 The national jobless rate hit a four-year high of 6.5 percent in February. as another half- million Americans joined the ranks of the unemployed.

HEADLINE: Speaker Offers Plan to Raise Income Tax

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 21

 BODY:
Assembly Speaker Mel Miller today proposed raising state income taxes by almost $1 billion, breaking sharply with Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and throwing budget deliberations here into turmoil with the legal deadline for a budget only 10 days away.
 Releasing his own alternative to the Governor's proposed budget, Mr. Miller said he wanted to scale back many major spending cuts sought by Mr. Cuomo, a fellow Democrat. For instance, he said, he would restore about $200 million in cuts in aid to New York City. 
Mr. Miller also rejected many of what he described as regressive tax measures in the Governor's budget, including a 10-cent-a-gallon increase in gasoline taxes. He said that an income tax increase that would hit wealthier New Yorkers harder than poorer residents was a fairer way to solve the state's fiscal problems.
 Under Mr. Miller's plan, the maximum personal income tax rate, now 7.875 percent, would be increased to 8.66 percent, after which it would gradually drop back over the next three years to its present level. He said the average taxpayer would face an increase in the first year of about $115, with poor families paying no increase and wealthy ones paying much more.
 
'Totally Unacceptable'
 The Governor has repeatedly pledged to veto any increase in broad-based taxes, and Ralph J. Marino, the Senate majority leader, today dismissed Mr. Miller's plan as "totally unacceptable."
 Officials here had already conceded that budget talks were so hopelessly bogged down that the April 1 deadline was unlikely to be met, but that did not stop either Mr. Miller or Mr. Marino from seizing on today's development as a way to deflect blame for the gridlock.
 Mr. Miller said that by proposing an alternative, the Assembly had demonstrated that it was ready to finish a budget on time. But Mr. Marino seemed to suggest that a late budget would be all Mr. Miller's fault.
 "To pull a surprise budget out of a hat without the bills basically says that April 1st is dead," he said. The most important impact of not having a state budget in place by the deadline would be that most state aid payments to cities would be frozen.
 Whatever budget is adopted, it will clearly include some of the deepest spending cuts New Yorkers have ever seen, as well as some form of increases in taxes and fees. But what remains far from resolved is not only the balance between those two, but questions of where to cut and whom to tax.
 The proposals from Mr. Miller today are part of a complex plan he has devised to spread some of the cuts over a longer period than Mr. Cuomo has envisioned. The Speaker's plan would put a budget into place that would last for 15 months, until July 1, 1992, at which point the state would legally shift the beginning of future fiscal years to July 1.
 Almost all other states, as well as New York City, start their fiscal years on July 1, and Mr. Miller has argued that the extra time would allow lawmakers to construct better budgets because they would have more reliable fiscal data.
 Mr. Miller's plan would eliminate several of the smaller taxes proposed by Mr. Cuomo, including a 2 percent tax on interstate telephone calls, a $5 tax on tires sold in the state and a tax on snack food that some legislators here have dubbed the Twinkie Tax.
 
Taxes That Hit All Payers Equally
 Mr. Miller said that many of Mr. Cuomo's proposed taxes, including the gasoline tax, were regressive because they tended to hit all New Yorkers equally, regardless of their wealth. Of Mr. Cuomo's proposed $5 tax on tire sales, Mr. Miller said, "Whether you have a BMW or whether you have a 15-year-old Ford that you keep on the farm, you're going to pay the same tax."
 Neither he nor Mr. Marino ruled out passing a gasoline tax at some point, with revenues specifically dedicated to repairing the state's roads and bridges, but both firmly rejected the tax in its present form because, they contended, it would basically be used to help balance the state's budget.
 The Governor's spokeswoman, Anne W. Crowley, said that Mr. Cuomo had seen no details of Mr. Miller's proposed budget, and she seemed to minimize its importance by describing it as "part of an ongoing annual ritual dance" of arriving at a budget.
 
Cuomo Repeats Pledge to Veto
 The Governor, speaking on a call-in radio program this evening, repeated his pledge to veto any increase in personal income tax rates, which he said would "crush the back of the economy of New York City."
 Mayor Dinkins is seeking more than $1 billion in new taxes himself, including about $335 million that require approval by the State Legislature.
 Mr. Miller's plan would add tax increases for city residents on top of Mayor Dinkins's, although it would also restore about $200 million of Mr. Cuomo's proposed cuts in aid to the city. The Governor has said that the total value of his cuts to the city is about $400 million, while city officials have pegged it at closer to $600 million.
 Responding to Mr. Miller's plan, the city's budget director, Philip R. Michael, said he did not want "to be in the position of supporting a tax increase." But, he added, "if there's a viable way that we can get an additional $200 million, obviously that would be of major assistance to us and we would be appreciative."

HEADLINE: Minorities A Majority In New York

BYLINE: By EDWARD B. FISKE

 BODY:
The number of Hispanic residents in New York City grew 26.8 percent in the 1980's as minority groups became a majority of the city's population for the first time, new census figures show.
 The figures confirm a historic shift anticipated by population experts after nearly half a century of whites leaving the city: the succession of European groups who founded New York and dominated it for centuries now transformed into a racial minority. 
Within the city's mix of races and ethnic groups, non-Hispanic whites declined 14.2 percent and are no longer a majority, but they remain the largest, with 43.2 percent of the population, down from 52.4 percent in 1980.
 Non-Hispanic blacks make up 25.2 percent, up from 24.0 percent. But after a decade of continued immigration from the Caribbean and Central America, Hispanic groups now rival blacks with 24.4 percent, up from 19.9 percent. Non-Hispanic Asians are 6.9 percent of the total.
 
'Alter the Economic Mix'
 "Put it in perspective, and you end up with the conclusion that New York City is by far the most ethnically and racially diverse city in the world," said Richard L. Schaffer, director of the Department of City Planning.
 Economists say the new diversity is likely to have large economic consequences for the city.
 "New immigrants do not simply replace old residents in the same jobs," said Rosemary Scanlon, the chief economist of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. "They alter the economic mix.
 "Look at the way Italians shaped the construction industry or, more recently, how Koreans have changed greengroceries," she said. "They work longer hours and display their products in new ways. It's a different kind of business."
 According to the Census Bureau, there were 3,163,125 non-Hispanic whites living in New York City in 1990, out of a population of 7,322,564.
 In 1980 the census counted 3,668,945 non-Hispanic residents, or 52.4 percent of a population of 7,071,639. In the 1980's New York reversed a population decline and grew by 250,925 people, but it did so on the strength of immigration, as non-Hispanic whites counted by the Census Bureau declined by 505,820, to 3,163,125.
 The number of Hispanic residents counted in 1990 was 1,783,511, compared with 1,404,024 10 years before. Non-Hispanic blacks increased to 1,847,049, from 1,694,127.
 City officials say the census understates the trend of new ethnic and racial groups replacing whites in the city's boroughs, contending that the count missed hundreds of thousands of people, most of them from such minority groups, many of them poor or illegal aliens. New York has joined other cities in challenging the census figures.
 In joining the ranks of American cities where whites are a minority, New York, in its diversity, is more like Los Angeles and San Francisco than cities like Detroit and Newark, where black majorities replaced white ones.
 According to the 1990 census, Los Angeles is 39.9 percent Hispanic, 37.3 white, 13.0 percent black, and 13.0 percent Asian , while San Francisco is 46.6 percent white, 28.4 percent Asian, 13.9 percent Hispanic and 10.5 percent black.
 Emanuel Tobier, a professor of economics and planning at New York University, suggested that the declining numbers of whites reflects a variety of developments, including the migration to the suburbs that began in earnest in the 1940's and has continued ever since.
 
Whites Having Fewer Children
 In addition, he said, "The white population with European backgrounds is also aging. That means that you have people moving South to retire and children growing up and leaving their parents' homes, which means that the average family size is lower."
 A lower birthrate among non-Hispanic whites compared with other groups is also a factor. "Even the younger whites who live in New York City have very few children."
 Mr. Tobier estimated that more than a fifth of the decline in the city's non-Hispanic white population was due to natural decrease: more deaths than births over the decade. The rest, he said, was the result of more whites leaving the city than coming to it.
 Nevertheless, the rate of decline slowed considerably. The loss during the 1980's of 540,078 white residents was less than half that of the 1970's, when their ranks dropped by 1,327,000. Losses also exceeded the one million mark in the 1950's and 1960's.
 The data showed that Hispanic residents increased at a faster rate than in the previous decade, while blacks also increased, but at a slower pace.
 Outmigration also seems to be occurring among blacks. "The overall black population went up by 153,000, but there should have been a natural increase of 240,000," said Mr. Tobier. "That means undercounting or outmigration or both."
 Other than non-Hispanic whites, the only group to show an absolute decline in population in any of the boroughs was blacks in Manhattan. Their ranks dropped by 29,441, to 261,120, a decline of 10.1 percent during the decade.
 Evelyn Mann, director of the population division of the Department of City Planning, suggested that this drop reflected both undercounting by the Census Bureau and a drop in the amount of desirable housing in Harlem, where most Manhattan blacks are concentrated.
 The new data represent the latest elaboration on Census Bureau figures which showed that the population of New York City rebounded from losses in the 1970's to increase by 250,925 people, or 3.5 percent, during the 1980's.
 For now, the census data sheds little light on substantial changes within the Hispanic population, where immigration from the Caribbean and Central America is diminishing the dominance of Puerto Ricans, and among Asians, where new arrivals now are more likely to be from rural China or Southeast Asia rather than Taiwan or Hong Kong.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Issues Rise Modestly

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Treasury securities posted modest price gains in slow trading yesterday, despite reported heavy selling by Japanese institutions.
 As often happens this time of year, Japanese institutions have been closing out positions in the fixed-income and other financial markets in preparation for March 31, the end of their fiscal year. 
Aside from a need to clean up balance sheets, the only news that motivated participants yesterday was a report from the Labor Department showing that initial unemployment claims rose by 45,000 in the week ended March 9, to 519,000.
 The increase, a sign the economy remained very weak after the end of the Persian Gulf war, prompted a bit of buying. But analysts and traders said the market is likely to remain generally listless through the end of the quarter.
 "At this point it will be hard for the market to establish a trend because it is the end of the quarter and we won't have any more meaningful economic data until the March employment report" is released on April 5, said Robert Chandross, chief economist at Lloyds Bank. "The market is basically biding its time."
 In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 7 7/8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered late yesterday at a price of 95 1/32, up 1/8 point, to yield 8.32 percent, down from 8.33 percent late Wednesday.
 Among Treasury note issues, the 7 3/4 percent 10-year notes were offered at 97 13/32, up 5/32, to yield 8.13 percent. And the 6 3/4 percent two-year notes were offered at 99 3/8, up 3/32, to yield 7.09 percent.
 Short-term Treasury bill rates were narrowly mixed.
 By late in the day, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 5.86 percent, up one basis point, or one-hundredth of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates fell three basis points, to a late offered rate of 5.85 percent.
 A number of issues were priced in the market for investment-grade corporate bonds, including a $500 million issue of five-year securities for the Province of Ontario.
 The 8.25 percent notes, which mature April 8, 1996, were priced at $99.96, to yield 8.26 percent, 45 basis points over the prevailing yield on Treasury securities of comparable maturity at the time of pricing.
 Salomon Brothers acted as lead manager on the transaction. The securities are rated AAA by both Moody's Investors Service and by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
 In addition, the Houston Lighting and Power Company offered $160 million of 30-year noncallable bonds through an underwriting syndicate led by the First Boston Corporation.
 The 9.15 percent securities, which mature March 15, 2021, were priced at $99.79, to yield 9.17 percent, 83 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 7 7/8 percent bonds of 2021.
 The securities are rated A-3 by Moody's and A-minus by Standard & Poor's.
 Participants in the market for high-yield "junk bonds" said an announcement that California's state pension fund intended to sell the $530 million face amount worth of high-yield securities in its portfolio had no impact on prices.
 In part, traders said the market did not react to the news because Calpers, as the pension fund is called, was known to have a large number of healthy names in its high-yield portfolio, issues that are currently in strong demand.
 Traders said that prices of most high-yield issues rose by about 1/2 point yesterday.
 In the tax-exempt municipal bond market, the City of New York offered for the first time $50 million worth of variable-rate notes.
 The notes, backed by letters of credit from Morgan Guaranty Trust Company and the Industrial Bank of Japan, have maturities ranging from Sept. 1, 1993 through 1995.
 The notes were priced at par with an initial coupon of 1.75 percent. The coupon will be reset on a daily basis by Lehman Brothers, which also acted as lead manager for the transaction. The notes may be "put" back to the issuer for cash. A coupon cap of 9 percent was set on the securities.
 Ratings of AAA from Moody's and AA from Standard & Poor's are expected.
 In the secondary market for tax-exempt securities, traders said that prices of most widely quoted issues rose by about 1/8 point.
 Elsewhere, the Federal Reserve Board reported that all three measures of the nation's money supply rose during the week ended March 11.
 The $6.2 billion increase in M-2, the aggregate most closely followed by the Fed, was a bit higher than analysts had been anticipating. But the money figures had no impact on prices in the credit markets.

HEADLINE: Your Money;
Preserving Assets of the Old and Ill

BYLINE: By Jan M. Rosen

 BODY:
When a middle-class elderly person suffers a debilitating illness like Alzheimer's disease that requires long-term custodial care, it can be devastating to a family, financially as well as emotionally.
The poor are provided for by Medicaid. The rich have ample resources. But all too often those in the middle class see their life savings siphoned off until they, too, are poor and qualify for Medicaid. 
 "This country may be a great place to have your heart transplanted; it's a lousy place to grow old," Robert M. Freedman, a partner in the New York law firm of Freedman & Fish, said last week at a Conference on Elder Law Planning for Professional Advisers sponsored by the UJA-Federation.
Still, Mr. Freedman said, there are steps that families can take to deflect the blow if they plan ahead. One is to buy insurance for long-term care. Another is to transfer assets to others in the family, or possibly to trusts, so the elderly person will qualify for Medicaid earlier.
Private insurance is needed because Medicare does not cover custodial care. It covers only care in a skilled nursing home after hospitalization, but many maladies of age like fragile bones and Alzheimer's disease do not require hospitalization.
Great care must be taken in selecting a policy, Mr. Freedman said, recommending that all policies be reviewed by an independent professional because coverage and state regulations vary.
Among the criteria, he said, are that benefits be high enough to pay nursing home costs plus an inflation rider, that prior hospitalization not be required, that custodial and home care be covered, that the policy be renewable for life, that premiums be level and that the carrier be rated A+ by Best.
The question of how to divest assets to protect a spouse or other heirs and allow an elderly person to qualify for Medicaid is extremely complicated. Regulations vary from state to state and are constantly changing. Relationships within a family must be considered, along with the older person's feelings about losing control of the assets, and possible tax consequences of the transfers.
"Much expert help is needed" on an individual basis, Mr. Freedman said.
One caveat is that a last-minute transfer may not work. In general those that take place more than 30 months before the application for Medicaid are safest.
Decisions about health care itself also have big financial and emotional consequences for entire families. Many people say vaguely that they would not want to be kept alive in a vegetative state, but legally hospitals and physicians may be required to take measures that a person would not want unless there is clear and convincing evidence of what is wanted.
Kathryn C. Meyer, senior vice president for legal affairs of Beth Israel Medical Center in New York, said, "Many people have not planned ahead, and they and their families run into major problems when they are hospitalized" because by then they have lost legal capacity to make the necessary decisions.
"A living will is the simplest way" to provide the necessary evidence for detailing what care is to be provided and what is to be refused, she said. But much of the interpretation of living wills depends on case law, which varies from state to state.
Therefore, it is advisable to supplement a living will with a health-care proxy, she said. In New York, the Health Care Agents and Proxies Law, which took effect on Jan. 18, allows a mentally competent adult to designate another person, often a family member, to make health-care decisions in case of loss of capacity. It does not expire but may be revoked.
She recommended having "lots of signed originals," and giving them to family members, physicians, lawyers and other advisers. Also, it will avoid confusion if the document conforms to statutory wording as closely as possible, rather than embellishing upon it.
Peter J. Strauss, a partner in Fink, Weinberger, a New York law firm, who also spoke at the conference, cautioned that people should designate only one person. A person who attempts to treat all children equally, for example, and names two or more in the proxy could set the scene for a family fight that can be resolved only with a court order.
Emphasizing the urgency for families to plan ahead, Robert J. Wolf, director of medical and geriatric services for the UJA-Federation, pointed out that although there is "more money for aging services than ever before, there is less per capita" from governmental agencies because medical advances have resulted in a large increase in the elderly population.

Rolls-Royce Plans to Cut 3,000 Jobs

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: LONDON, March 22

 BODY:
The British aircraft-engine maker Rolls-Royce said it planned to drop 3,000 from its work force of 35,000 this year. A company spokesman attributed the cuts to the health of the aerospace industry, which has been hurt by the drop in airline travel during the Persian Gulf crisis. Recession in the United States and Britain, among other nations, has also hurt the industry.
"We have not seen any significant cancellation of orders, but it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that this is a possibility," the spokesman said.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Advances Strongly; Gold Is Marginally Higher

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar advanced strongly on world currency markets yesterday, failing to fade in the wake of concerted central bank intervention.
Gold prices were marginally higher. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery rose 10 cents to settle at $363.10 an ounce, and the active April contract was unchanged at $363.50. The Republic National Bank quoted a late bid for gold of $362.30, up 50 cents an ounce from Thursday's late bid. 
 Analysts said the dollar had moved higher for no clear reason. The German Bundesbank and other European central banks moved again to stem the dollar's advance as the European trading session drew to a close, the third time this week that they acted to curb the dollar's rise.
About the same time, analysts said, the Federal Reserve intervened in domestic markets, also to drive the dollar lower.
"It was unusual in the sense that we had seen concerted rounds of intervention before, but not one in which the Fed and the Europeans were in at the same time," said Andrew Hodge, a vice president at Bank Brussels Lambert's New York office.
Unlike the action on Thursday, the intervention was largely unsuccessful. But some analysts speculate it is just a matter of time before the central banks wear the dollar down.
There is also speculation that the dollar will drift lower naturally once investors turn their attention back to the United States economy, which is not recovering as quickly as many had predicted. Many thought the end of the Persian Gulf war would help the economy snap back, in part as consumer confidence was restored.
The underlying sentiment toward the United States currency remains largely bullish, said Marc Chandler, an analyst with the firm IDEA.
Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar fell 1.25 yen to a closing 137.05 yen. Later, in London, it rose to 137.15 yen. In New York, the dollar settled at 137.60 yen, up from 136.73 yen on Thursday.
In London, the British pound fell to $1.7890, from $1.7930 late Thursday. In New York it cost $1.7860 to buy one pound, less expensive than Thursday's $1.7995.
Against the German currency, the dollar rose to 1.6485 marks, from 1.6315 on Thursday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Thursday's rates, included: 1.4135 Swiss francs, up from 1.4055; 5.6030 French francs, up from 5.5555; 1,225.38 Italian lire, up from 1,215.50, and 1.1578 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1555.

Goodrich Gives Earnings Outlook

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: AKRON, Ohio, March 22

 BODY:
Citing adverse economic conditions, B.F. Goodrich said it expected to break even or report a modest loss this quarter. "The recession is taking an especially heavy toll on a number of our businesses that depend on the strength and vitality of economic conditions generally," the chemical company said.
Sales of its Geon Vinyl Products unit continue to decline, and its Specialty Chemicals segment is reporting results well below those of the period a year ago. The company also said its Aerospace business was slightly below results a year ago. 
 The company earned $16.2 million in last year's first quarter, and analysts' estimates for first-quarter net income have ranged from $2 million to $10 million, Goodrich said. The company's stock fell 62.5 cents today, to $38.125, on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR;
Congress Withholds $55 Million in Aid to Jordan

BYLINE: By MARTIN TOLCHIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 22

 BODY:
Congress today approved but modified the revocation of $55 million in aid to Jordan and a ban on military sales to allies who failed to fulfill their pledges of financial assistance for the Persian Gulf war.
The action reflected Congressional resentment at King Hussein's support of President Saddam Hussein of Iraq in the gulf war, and at what lawmakers considered the laggardly pace of payment by allies who have pledged financial support of the desert operation. 
 The modifications, to overcome President Bush's veto threats, were made in two spending bills intended to pay for the gulf war. Congress then went on a two-week Easter recess.
Marlin Fitzwater, the President's spokesman, said that Mr. Bush would sign both bills, a $5.2 billion measure to expand benefits for American veterans of the gulf war, and one for $15 billion to pay for the war in the event that nations that had pleged financial assistance fail to fulfill their pledges.
The Senate passed both bills by voice votes, while the House passed the first bill by a vote of 340 to 48, and the second by 379 to11.
The approval modified a Senate-passed prohibition on $55 million in pending military and economic aid to Jordan, to enable Jordan to receive the full amount if the President certified to Congress that King Hussein was helping advance the peace process. Under the Senate version, Jordan could have received $35 million in economic aid under that certification, but not an additional $20 million in military funds.
President Bush opposed the measure as restricting his flexibility in conducting Middle East diplomacy. He also warned that the move could destabilize the Amman Government and result in a regime more hostile to American interests. The action will not affect humanitarian aid to Jordan, nor $246 million already in the pipeline in the form of pending contracts.
Congress also modified a Senate-passed ban on Government funds for military sales to any nation that failed to make good on its pledge of financial assistance for the gulf war. The compromise exempted those nations that had met their payment schedules, even if they had not paid the entire amount they had pledged.
 
Non-Gulf Measures
 The pledges totaled $54.5 billion, of which $25.6 billion has thus far been paid. Congress estimated the cost of the war at $42.6 billion and rising. If the war costs less than the contributions paid by the allies, they will be rebated on a pro rata basis.
The compromise also included a prohibition on the transfer of weapons used in the war to Middle East countries without Congressional approval. That action will make it harder for Saudi Arabia and Israel to keep Patriot missile batteries in their countries. The restriction, also opposed by the White House, was modified to give military commanders flexibility in the transfer of weapons until a cease-fire was signed, and enabled such transfers thereafter if they were considered essential by the military.
The compromise included some non-gulf war measures. It dropped, for example, a Senate-passed measure that would increase dairy price supports. Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont and chairman of the Agriculture committee, said, "It's too bad these dairy farmers don't live in some foreign country. We could probably do something for them."
The bills provide $1 billion for the F-14, built by Grumman on Long Island and Maryland's Eastern Shore. Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, said: "This is a huge victory for New York, Long Island and Grumman. It will save 4,000 jobs directly and thousands of others in related positions."
The bills also provided $650 million in aid to Israel and $200 million for Turkey; $100 million to buy 156 Patriot missiles; $150 million to let the states cope with increased applications for unemployment insurance, and $1.5 billion for food stamps.
The compromise included a requirement that the Government spend $1.2 billion to refurbish the aircraft carrier Kennedy at the Philadelphia Navy Yard, a reflection of the clout of Representative John P. Murtha, Democrat of Pennsylvania and chairman of the defense subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee.
Senator John W. Warner, Republican of Virginia, which is threatened with base closings, said: "This will set a precedent. People will say, 'Why didn't you take this precaution in your state?' "

HEADLINE: Changing Warehouses Into a Cultural Center

BYLINE: By ANDREW L. YARROW

 BODY:
Half a mile of water separates the popular, slick and immensely profitable South Street Seaport from an abandoned and forbidding cluster of nine red-brick warehouses on the Brooklyn waterfront known as the Empire Stores. By the end of the decade, this huge complex of prime Brooklyn waterfront buildings could become a cultural and retail center as large as the Seaport, if a preliminary development proposal being presented to community groups ever comes to fruition.
Under the plan, which was drafted by the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation and the State Urban Development Corporation, the warehouses would be transformed into art galleries, theaters, artists' studios, a museum, shops and restaurants. 
 The 120-year-old buildings, between the Brooklyn and Manhattan Bridges, are now crumbling and littered with debris, their arched windows covered by rusting steel, with a tangle of vines and trees growing on and through their brick facades. They are in a historic district designated by the city, and are also part of Empire-Fulton Ferry State Park, which includes an adjacent three-acre waterfront lawn.
"This could be the focal point for Brooklyn waterfront redevelopment," said Ed Rogowsky, Brooklyn's representative on the City Planning Commission and the chairman of the urban studies department at Brooklyn College. "It provides million-dollar views of Manhattan and could be a great attraction. And it's as close to downtown Brooklyn and new office developments like Metrotech as the Seaport is to Manhattan's financial district."
 
Theaters and Museum
 The proposal is to be completed after public meetings this spring.
Several small experimental theaters would occupy the two smaller buildings near New Dock Street, once used for storing tobacco. The adjacent four- and five-story buildings, formerly used as coffee and spice warehouses, would have an even mix of retail and cultural uses, said Elizabeth Goldstein, the regional director of the State Parks Department. The proposal also includes a museum of Brooklyn waterfront history to be overseen by the Brooklyn Historical Society.
Pedestrian access from Brooklyn Heights, downtown Brooklyn and nearby subway stations -- currently treacherous because of entrance ramps to the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway -- would be improved and an parking garage built, Ms. Goldstein said. Ferry service to lower Manhattan, which existed from 1642 until 1924, might be restored, she added.
"We want to activate the site as much as possible," Ms. Goldstein said. "I'd like to see it as a place where there would be children's theater on Saturday afternoons, cabarets in the evening, artists working and people coming for dinner."
The cost of redeveloping the 375,000-square-foot complex is put at $107 million, according to the proposal, which was prepared for $175,000 by Beyer Blinder Belle, the company that did restoration studies for Ellis Island.
 
Public Funds Uncertain
 When planning began two years ago, it was estimated that $20 million would come from the state and city, with the remainder from private developers. But budget problems and the defeat of the Environmental Quality Bond Act in November put the public financing in doubt, said Harold Holzer, an executive vice president for the Urban Development Corporation. Alternative funding will be sought, he said, though private money "will also be very tough to assemble."
The State Parks Department bought the long-dormant Empire Stores from Con Edison in 1978 for $750,000. An entertainment and retail complex was proposed in the mid-1980's by a developer, David Walentas, -- whose company, Two Trees Management, owns several nearby buildings -- but "the project proved unfeasible," Ms. Goldstein said.
Although parks advocates and the waterfront's flourishing artists' community generally welcome the new proposal, some residents worry that it could become too commercially oriented if public financing and control of the project are reduced. Under the current plan, 55 percent of the project would be devoted to nonprofit cultural uses, with the rest as retail development. By comparison, about 85 percent of the 320,000-square-foot South Street Seaport development is given over to retail uses.
"The concern is that it could become another Seaport," Mr. Rogowsky said. "Our basic public-policy problem with this and similar public-private projects is how to get the capital and ongoing revenue stream without ceding them entirely to retail interests."

HEADLINE: Port Authority Raises Tolls for 6 Bridges and Tunnels to $4

BYLINE: By RICHARD LEVINE

 BODY:
The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey voted yesterday to increase the basic toll on passenger cars by $1, to $4, on its six bridges and tunnels.
The increase, to take effect on April 7, followed weeks of negotiations with the administrations of Gov. Jim Florio of New Jersey and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York. In return for their consent, the authority will increase to $420 million a fund that the states can divide for transportation and economic development projects of their choosing.
The authority, under pressure from the Governors and constrained by stagnant revenues, also said it would reduce its marketing and advertising programs, cut costs for travel and meals, freeze some salaries and leave certain jobs vacant, postpone replacing staff cars and even sell one of its two helicopters. 
 "Both Governors, from the start, wanted to see evidence that the Port Authority's way of approaching expenses and even symbolic lifestyle issues was going to change," said Richard C. Leone, the authority chairman. "And we have tried to be responsive to that.
 Yesterday's vote came just five days after the New Jersey Turnpike authority raised its tolls by 70 percent for cars and by 100 percent for trucks. A motorist driving the full length of the turnpike and then using a Port Authority bridge or tunnel will soon pay $8.60 for a trip that would have cost $5.70 last week.
Yesterday, in a gloomy, rainy evening rush outside the Lincoln Tunnel, most drivers seemed resigned to higher tolls although a few said they would try to cut down on unnecessary trips.
"I think it stinks," said Brenda Miles, a Plainfield, N.J., resident.
And Bill Freedman, a commuter from Elizabeth, said: "I'm hit both ways. They should fix the roads before raising tolls."
But the Port Authority's tolls, which are charged only in one direction and are collected from 350,000 automobile drivers on a typical workday, are still cheaper than the $2.50 that the Metropolitan Tranportation Authority charges in each direction at its East River crossings.
And the Port Authority, in a reversal from its original plan, has also retained some of its toll discounts, although it has restructured them to take into account mass transit alteratives available to motorists.
"These are smart tolls," Mr. Leone said, "designed to cause the least collateral damage."
Twenty-ticket commuter discount books will continue to be sold for $40 at the Staten Island bridges -- the Bayonne and Goethals Bridges and the Outerbridge Crossing -- where motorists have few mass transit op tions. But starting on May 12, the discount on the George Washington Bridge, by far the busiest crossing, will be reduced from one-third to one-quarter, and drivers will pay $60 for the 20-ticket books. And motorists at the Holland and Lincoln Tunnels, who have the most transit options, will get only the 10 percent discount that is available at all Port Authority crossings for motorists using the agency's scrip.
Because of these changes, discount tickets will be good only at the crossings where they are purchased. Refunds for unused tickets will no longer be provided.
Discount ticket books for car pools will remain at $30 for 60 round trips. Tolls for buses and fares on the Path rail line will not change.
 
$2.7 Billion Budget
 "The system of discounts was really an improvement," said Richard T. Anderson, president of the Regional Plan Association.
The vice president of the Automobile Club of New York, James McGowan, said the Staten Island discounts were "the one glimmer of hope" but added that his organization had not ruled out a legal challenge to the increase.
The toll increase was included in a 1991 budget of $2.7 billion unanimously approved by the six of the 10 Port Authority board members who attended yesterday's meeting at the World Trade Center.
The authority last raised tolls in 1987, when they went to $3 from $2.
In seeking an increase, the agency has been forced to negotiate with the Governors, who have veto power over its actions.
Yesterday's action would increase by $270 million the amount of Port Authority money available to each state. That money comes from a $5.4 billion capital program that the authority plans over the next five years. Mr. Florio has already spoken of several projects that he wants the Port Authority to help pay for, including a transfer station at Secaucus that would let some N.J. Transit rail passengers switch to trains on the Northeast Corridor tracks for New York City.
New York State has not specified any projects yet, but an authority document outlining the toll increase mentions improvements to the Staten Island Expressway and the Cross Bronx Expressway.
Because the toll plan was altered and delayed, it will generate less than the $139 million a year that the authority had anticipated. So the agency said it was cutting operating and capital costs.
But in its financial projections, the authority said it was possible if not likely that another deficit would arise by 1993 or 1994.

HEADLINE: Soviet Oil Industry Outlook Is Called Dismal by Experts

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 21

 BODY:
The Soviet Union's oil industry is in a steep, continuing decline, and the most likely remedy -- an infusion of Western capital and technology that both Soviet officials and American oil companies had hoped for -- is beginning to seem out of reach, according to experts at a conference today at Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service. The reason: political uncertainty within the country.
The Soviet oil industry is still the world's largest, about 18 percent ahead of Saudi Arabia's, and it is both vital to the nation's economic stability and important to the world energy balance. But production is declining rapidly because of cuts in investment in recent years, backward technology and the Soviet Union's general economic breakdown, experts said at the conference, sponsored by Georgetown and Salomon Brothers. 
 Several high-ranking Soviet oil and gas officials told potential investors that with new capital and technology they could raise production. But they, as well as Western analysts, painted a confused picture on such crucial questions as who owns the mineral resources, who has jurisdiction over joint ventures and outside investment, and what taxes will be applied.
For example, Ronald Benson, the American director of White Nights Oil and Gas Joint Venture, which says it is the first American-Soviet joint drilling venture, said that his group had raised $80 million and had agreed to take over three oilfields in western Siberia, now producing 20,000 barrels a day. The group, expecting to expand output to 150,000 barrels and to have new drilling rigs shipped in by May or June, has already spent between $10 million and $15 million.
In January, however, the central Government announced that under a law passed last year, oil exports this year would be taxed at 40 percent.
Mr. Benson, who is also vice president of Phibro Energy Inc., a Salomon subsidiary, said that if the tax stood, drilling would be canceled. He added: "You couldn't go to a bank anywhere in the world today and get money to do work like this in the Soviet Union. You have to be ready to take risks."
An executive of a large American oil company that has been talking with the Soviets for months called the 40 percent tax "a real show-stopper." The executive, who spoke on condition that his company not be identified, said that at that tax level, or even a much smaller tax that was put in place after deals had been signed, there would probably be no joint ventures at all.
Tuboscope, a Houston-based company that makes pipeline-inspection equipment, has experience in the Soviet Union but is finding it harder to work there now. Robert Lahr, its president, said that because of the uncertainties, it is planning to limit its work to subcontracting for a major company that would be paid in oil, to simplify payment.
 
 Investment Failure Seen

Others predicted failure for foreign investors. Dr. Stanislav Shatalin, author of the rejected 500-day plan for transformation of the Soviet economy and a former adviser to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, said that under the current conditions, "if I was a banker I would not invest a single cent in our economy." The Soviet Union is backing away from a free-market system, he asserted.
Jeffery Burt, a lawyer with Arnold & Porter in Washington, said that companies would be wise not to invest much until they had approvals in hand from as many layers of government as possible. "The exit strategy may be more important than the entrance strategy," he added.
John Blaney, economics counselor of the American Embassy in Moscow, described doing business in the Soviet Union as "almost like a three-dimensional chess game, where each level has different rules and different pieces, and every once in a while, on any level, all the rules change."
Investors seemed to be souring, too. Rick Woltman, an analyst at ASB Capital Management, a Washington firm that manages $9 billion, said: "The potential is hyped. It's dangerous and problematic."
Despite the gloom, top Soviet officials maintained that with some new capital and technology, they could work wonders in their troubled industry.
Rantik Margulov, the first deputy chairman of the Bureau of Fuel and Power of the U.S.S.R. Council of Ministers, said the Soviet oil industry was "entering a new century with a large portion of unsolved technical, ecological, economic and political questions." To obtain the needed oil, he said, executives would have to "concentrate the economic and technical resources of several countries."
Akif Djabarov, general director of Gazneft Azerbajian, the republic's oil- and gas-producing enterprise, said oil reserves were vast but deeper than the 10,000 feet to which his company could drill. Also, more oil could be recovered from older fields if 4,000 wells could be renovated and air compressor stations built, he said, an impossibility with the resources in Azerbaijian, where the price of oil produced is artificially low.
Although the health of the Soviet industry has been poor for some time, Western experts said they could not tell how bad it was, because some restive republics have stopped reporting data.
 
2.2 Million This Year
 Earlier this week, Pravda reported that President Gorbachev had said that crude oil exports would be only half what was originally planned. Experts at the conference said, however, that much of what the Soviets export is oil products, not crude, and that it was already clear exports were falling.
Robert E. Ebel, vice president of the Enserch Corporation, a Dallas-based energy, engineering and construction company, put exports at some 3.1 million barrels a day last year, down from 4.1 million barrels two years earlier. He foresaw 2.2 million barrels this year. By comparison, the global oil market is a bit over 60 million barrels a day; Kuwait's prewar OPEC quota was 1.5 million barrels a day, and Iraq's was 3.5 million.
Since the late 1970's the United States has feared the transformation of the Soviet Union from a global supplier into a competitor for supplies. The Central Intelligence Agency published a report in 1977 predicting this by 1985. Mr. Ebel said that the same report, with the dates changed, could be convincingly released today.
Thane Gustavson, a Georgetown professor and expert on Soviet oil, said that to halt the decline, the Soviets had more than doubled the annual oilfield investment in the 1980's, until oil consumed 70 percent of new industrial investment. Nevertheless, he added, new wells in 1989 had an average flow of about 80 barrels a day, only one-tenth the level of a decade earlier. Adding wells costs $10,000 a barrel a day of capacity, he said, far above the cost in other countries.
"They did what any oil industry would do," he added. "They went for the fat targets and the easy geology first. They have not exhausted those, but they have run them down." Fields left to be tapped are smaller, more complicated in their geology and more remote, he said.
 
Outlook Called Bleak
 Some experts say that even if Western involvement comes quickly, the production outlook is bleak. Robert Copaken, senior political economist at the Department of Energy's Office of International Affairs, said the Soviets would be fortunate to stabilize production at current levels. "I think they will always go for self-sufficiency," he said. "But they may not continue to be significant net exporters."
Eastern Europe may feel a big part of the decline in exports, because the Soviets are now demanding hard currency from their former bloc, where they once bartered. On the other hand, Shane Streifel, senior analyst at the International Energy Agency, said that exports to the industrialized democracies in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development have held up "reasonably well in 1990, and may continue in 1991."

HEADLINE: Los Angeles Officers Win Delay on Entering Pleas in Beating

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, March 22

 BODY:
Four police officers accused of assault in the videotaped beating of a black motorist won a delay today until next week to enter their pleas in court, while new disclosures continued to feed public anger over the incident.
In grand jury testimony quoted this morning by The Los Angeles Daily News, witnesses at a hospital where the beaten man, Rodney G. King, was treated said that police officers taunted him, boasting that they had "played a little hardball" and "hit quite a few home runs" while beating him. 
 A nurse, Carol Diane Edwards, is quoted as telling the grand jury that an officer said to Mr. King, "We played a little hardball tonight, and you lost."
Charged in the beating of Mr. King on March 3 are Sgt. Stacey C. Koon and Officers Laurence M. Powell, Timothy E. Wind and Theodore J. Briseno. All four are free on bail.
 
Time to Study Transcripts
 In their brief appearance in court today, the officers said nothing. After allowing their lawyers the extra time to study transcripts from grand jury hearings, Superior Court Judge Gary Klausner urged speed, saying, "I want to get this thing assigned out so we can get this thing running at a proper pace."
The prosecutor, Assistant District Attorney Terry White, said, "I think they think they need more information than they need to enter a plea."
The police pursuit of Mr. King's white Hyundai began on the Foothill Freeway, on the northern outskirts of Los Angeles, and proceeded on city streets.
The California Highway Patrol today made public a tape recording of radio communications from officers who initially pursued Mr. King's car.
Like an earlier recording released by the Los Angeles Police Department, it made no reference to his speed on the freeway before he turned onto city streets.
A highway patrol spokesman, Sgt. Mike Brey, earlier said that Mr. King had been traveling at up to 115 miles per hour, a speed both Mr. King and a passenger, Bryant Allen, disputed.
The tape released today indicates that Mr. King was pursued for approximately two and three-fourths miles before leaving the freeway.
As the pursuit continued on city streets, the tape includes a report by officers that he was driving as fast as 65 m.p.h. on streets where the speed limit is 45.
The police department tape included a reference to a speed of 55 m.p.h. on streets where the limit was 40.
Mr. King, a 25-year-old unemployed construction worker, remained hospitalized today after an operation on a fractured eye socket. He suffered multiple skull fractures and a broken ankle, among other injuries.
Dr. Alvin Reiter, a plastic surgeon who operated on him, said today, "There's a good possibility that he'll have permanent numbness, permanent paralysis and problems with chewing and opening up his mouth without discomfort."

HEADLINE: Some Veterans Facing New Battles on Return

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES

 BODY:
The return of gulf war veterans to workaday life after the cheering stops will bring surprises for managers, co-workers and spouses, as well as the veterans themselves -- and many companies and workers are poorly prepared.
In several cases, small-business owners, salespeople and professionals are returning to discover that they will have to rebuild their businesses and reclaim old clients and customers who have drifted away while they were in the gulf. Those kinds of competitive pressures on the job will compound the financial worries that plague many returning veterans. 
 "About two more weeks of this and I'd be in financial straits," said Thomas J. Blagg, a gunnery sergeant in the Marine Reserves. Mr. Blagg, who returned to his regiment's base in Dallas last week, said his income plunged to one-fourth the level he earned as a sales manager before being called up in December.
In a few cases, having no job in the midst of a recession will be the worst surprise for returning veterans. At the McDonnell Douglas Corporation in St. Louis, which pared 15,000 jobs in the months after the war began last August, four reservists were caught in the cutbacks. The company guaranteed jobs for all nonunion employees called into the military, but the unlucky four were members of one of two unions whose seniority rules left them without work.
Of the 545,000 American troops sent to Saudi Arabia after Iraq invaded Kuwait last August, 80,000 were called up from the military Reserve and National Guard units. Over all, 227,400 reservists and National Guard members were called to active duty.
It hardly matters, psychologists and experts said, whether a veteran was on the front lines or far from combat. "There was constant, pervasive fear of impending doom, impending death, and never knowing if something might happen," said Dr. Calvin J. Frederick, chief of psychological services at the Veterans Affairs Hospital in Los Angeles, who has counseled several gulf war veterans. "Some of the troops experienced weight loss, fatigue and loss of sleep and are really stressed out. All of these things at one level are normal. It's only if they continue and become intense that they will need to seek help."
How this will manifest itself in the workplace is difficult to predict. But experts say veterans who confronted combat and death are most vulnerable to sleep problems, prickly moods, elevated blood pressure, inability to concentrate on a task and digestion troubles commonly associated with post-traumatic stress disorder, a mental disturbance that some researchers believe affects one of five Vietnam veterans.
Some psychologists say that in stirring old ghosts of battle, the gulf war might even cause more troubles among Vietnam veterans in the workplace than among the new veterans.
 
 Impatience Expected

Dr. Robert Albanese, head of the Center for Human Resources at Texas A & M University, in College Station, Tex., said many workers who saw duty in the gulf might consider their work trivial and show little patience with the mistakes of others.
Dr. Reagan Andrews, a clinical psychologist at the Veterans Affairs Hospital in Dallas, said executives should consider assigning these people to special projects or making them trouble-shooters.
For years, many large employers have relied on employee-assistance programs to provide counseling for troubled workers and their families. Over the years, these programs have provided help for alcohol and drug abuse, family problems and depression. But some experts warn that these programs may not be enough to deal with the special problems that veterans encounter on the job.
Dr. Albanese said managers who direct the assistance programs often know too little about how special counseling services can help or which employees need them.
 
'Prepared to Help'

Many families of reservists on the payroll at McDonnell Douglas have already asked for medical and financial advice. "We are prepared to help, whatever the circumstances," said Daniel C. Smith, the company's director of employee-assistance services.
Many reservists who returned from the gulf last week said emotional outpourings of public support helped to soothe memories of terror and destruction. "We have been deluged with requests for things like color guards and speakers to come to Lions clubs," said Bill J. English, a lieutenant colonel in the Marine Reserves who directed artillery fire in the combat zone and once fought as an enlisted marine in Vietnam. A lawyer in Norman, Okla., Mr. English, who is 44 years old, was toasted by more than 100 friends at a surprise party last Saturday night.
But for many returning veterans, the most immediate problem will be financial. Mr. Blagg, the Marine gunnery sergeant, said that if he was released from duty by the end of next week he would be in his sales office in Krum, Tex., the following Monday. Returnees can take up to 90 days off before they return to work, but Mr. Blagg said, "I can't afford to."
Other sales managers in his division at Central Transport Inc., a transportation company based in Detroit, tried to cover his seven-state territory during his absence, but competitors lured away some big accounts. Mr. Blagg said he must move quickly to regain those customers or his income would suffer. "I'm judged by my production," he said.
Other veterans are thinking about economic warfare, too. David Meek, owner of an office-supply company in Topeka, Kan., and navigator on a KC-135 refueling tanker, said one of his worst moments during the war was when he was told during a call home that Bizmart, a national chain of discount office-supply stores, would open a store in Topeka next month. "That probably shook me the most of anything that happened over there," he said.
Mr. English, the lawyer, had to drop his private practice and its six-figure income when he left on Dec. 4 for the military. The yearly pay rate for his job as a lieutenant colonel in the Marine Reserves is about $50,000. "The pay cut was enough to make my banker go crazy," he said.
Hours before he left, Mr. English got in touch with his clients and gave their files to other lawyers. "Most of the clients were understanding," he said. "But with all due respect, they want you there when they want you there. All that aside, I wanted to go and was happy to go."
Mr. English said he once spoke against legal advertising when he headed the local bar association, but he now sees few options in attracting old and new clients. "It will take a good amount of time to get the practice up to where it was," he said.
 
Threatened With Evictions
 In some cases, spouses and children of reservists with modest incomes have suffered badly. Military chaplains in the Dallas area said Hispanic families were unlawfully threatened with eviction from homes and apartments when paychecks from reservists were slow to arrive in the mail.
"Ribbons are fine, rallies are fine, but I don't think the American people realize that these people need financial help," said Sam Boyd, a former Green Beret commander in Vietnam. A lawyer in Dallas, Mr. Boyd has begun a campaign to raise $1 million to be used for interest-free loans and grants to families of military reservists and National Guard members in northern Texas.
Some psychologists said the military services would be returning thousands of managers and workers who discovered new courage or leadership abilities in the crucible of combat or training that far outweigh any mental or physical ills they bring with them
 
More Appreciation of Life
 And some have learned simply to appreciate life a bit more. Mr. Meek, who flew 32 missions over northern Saudi Arabia and Iraq during the 42 days of war, said: "When you suddenly find yourself in these intense conflicts and question whether or not you're going to survive, you set your priorities differently. I'm going to take a little more time to enjoy life."
James Campbell Quick, a specialist on stress management and a professor of organizational behavior at the University of Texas at Arlington, said: "The low number of casualties has a very important effect on those who have gone to war. Employers can anticipate that there are going to be fewer misadjustment problems as a result. You never have a good war, but from our standpoint this is getting close."

The two men, respectively a sales manager and a lawyer in private practice in civilian life, suffered considerable financial hardship as a result of their call-up and plan to return to work soon after they are released from active military duty (Jarrold Cabluck for The New York Times) (pg. 31)

Chart: "Helping the Returning Veterans"
 
What managers can do to ease transition from active duty to the office for reservists and National Guard members who served in the war, according to psychologists specializing in veterans' affairs.
 
Talk it out. Encourage veterans to discuss their experience if they want to, but do not pry. Let them set the tone.
 
Be aware of problems. Expect the work of some veterans to be impaired by sleep disorders, their startled responses to unexpected sounds or motions, and vivid, terrifying daydreams.
 
Set goals. Be clear about performance goals but do not coddle veterans. Anticipate that readjustment could take months.
 
Expect new attitudes. Deliver criticism when necessary, but anticipate occasionally angry reactions.
 
Rethink schedules. Consider offering overtime to provide extra income.
 
Be sensitive. Veterans face letdowns as the thrill of victory and homecomings gives way to the mundane realities of life. Many will discover new priorities and want more challenging jobs. The alert manager can direct these restive, new ambitions into special projects. (pg. 41)

HEADLINE: U.S. Law on Hospital Care of Poor Faces Test

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
Rosa Rivera had no doctor, no prenatal care and dangerously high blood pressure when she arrived at the emergency room of DeTar Hospital in Victoria, Tex., in labor with her sixth child.
Dr. Michael Burditt, the obstetrician on call, examined Mrs. Rivera and found that her blood pressure was the highest he had ever seen in a pregnant woman. Then he made a decision that has put him at the center of a Federal court case testing the limits of Goverment regulation of emergency care for poor people. 
 Dr. Burditt ordered the woman transferred 170 miles to a public hospital in Galveston, the closest place with advanced equipment for newborns.
When the nurse questioned the wisdom of moving Mrs. Rivera, who waited almost two hours for the ambulance without being re-examined, Dr. Burditt replied, "Until DeTar pays my malpractice insurance, I will pick and choose those patients that I want to treat."
 
Baby Born in Ambulance
 No medical difficulty resulted: Mrs. Rivera gave birth to a healthy baby boy in an ambulance 30 miles from Victoria. But Dr. Burditt's decision on Dec. 5, 1986, has brought the Federal Government's first important test of a 1986 law intended to stop hospitals from refusing to treat poor patients like Mrs. Rivera, a practice sometimes called patient dumping.
An administrative law judge has fined Dr. Burditt $20,000 for violating the 1986 law and acting with reckless disregard of Mrs. Rivera's health. The doctor's appeal is to be argued May 2 in the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans.
While the Department of Health and Human Services has brought 15 dumping cases against hospitals, and collected more than $1 million in fines, the case against Dr. Burditt is the first against an individual physician, and may determine just how broadly the 1986 Federal law, the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, will apply.
Dr. Burditt said he did not violate the law. He explained that he sent Mrs. Rivera away not because she was poor, but because he thought her baby might need treatment in the Galveston hospital's advanced neonatal unit.
But in supporting Dr. Burditt, the American Medical Association goes further, arguing that the Government is overreaching, seeking to use the dumping law to attack pure medical judgments, and in the process, creating a national standard of medical care that will leave the profession extremely vulnerable to malpractice claims. If the Government wins, the association warns, it will become increasingly difficult to find good emergency-room doctors.
 
Constitutional Issue Raised
 And the Texas Medical Association, also supporting Dr. Burditt, says the whole law is unconstitutional because it requires doctors to treat poor patients without compensation.
Dr. Burditt earns his living in private practice, and is not paid by the hospital. But like all the obstetricians at DeTar, a private hospital, he is required to take a turn caring for the hospital's walk-in obstetric patients -- many of them indigent -- in return for being allowed to admit his private patients to the hospital.
Victoria is a city of 55,000 people in an agricultural area of South Texas. The hospital's nursery has a Level 2 rating, meaning that it is well equipped and able to care properly for all infants except those needing the most advanced technology for their survival.
Michael Astrue, general counsel of the Department of Health and Human Services, which brought the case against the doctor, said the medical associations were in essence challenging the basic idea that emergency rooms have an obligation to treat anyone needing emergency care.
"The Texas Medical Association is holding out for the right to pick and choose among everybody who comes into emergency rooms, and screen out those deemed to be high risk," he said. "That's not how the public understands what an emergency room holds itself out to do. We're very sensitive to the fact that small rural hospitals do not have the same resources as large urban ones. But we do not believe that Mrs. Rivera was sent away because Dr. Burditt thought the case was over his head."
Mr. Astrue says nothing in the law requires the Government to prove either bad faith or that the transfer was economically motivated. To the contrary, the law covers all patients, rich or poor, and all transfers ordered for nonmedical reasons.
According to a coalition of civil rights and women's groups backing the Government, the dumping law would be almost unenforceable if it required proof that a doctor's decision was economically motivated.

 "You're never going to have a doctor who says, 'Take her away because she's poor,' and the law doesn't require that," said Martha Davis of the NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund. "What's amazing about this case is that the doctor said as much as he did, and made this woman have a baby by the side of the road when she should have been in the hospital."
The 1986 law requires all hospitals that receive Medicaid money to provide emergency care to anyone with an unstabilized emergency medical condition and any woman in active labor.
Under the law, such patients may be transferred elsewhere only for medical reasons, and only after the doctor certifies that the risks of the transfer are outweighed by the medical benefits to the patient. For every violation of the law, the doctor or hospital can be fined up to $50,000.
In the Burditt case, an administrative law judge found that Mrs. Rivera's high blood pressure put her at serious risk of stroke, seizures, heart attack and other conditions that could have killed her and her baby, and that her transfer to another hospital "in the uncontrolled environment of an ambulance" increased the risk.
Because the decision to transfer her was not medically reasonable, the judge found, it violated the 1986 law, whether or not it was influenced by Mrs. Rivera's poverty. The judge also criticized Dr. Burditt for not re-examining Mrs. Rivera in the nearly two hours before the ambulance took her away, and for his refusal to treat her when the ambulance returned her and the baby to DeTar Hosptial.
 
Doctor Defends Decision
 Despite his comment to the nurse about the hospital's paying for his malpractice insurance, Dr. Burditt insists he decided to transfer Mrs. Rivera out of concern for her welfare.
"My main concern was that if the baby had problems, as I thought it might based on her blood pressure, it would be in a place where it could get the best care," he said in an interview. "The nurse involved and I were not getting along very well, and some of the things I said were just meant to irritate her, and that remark about malpractice was one of them. And the best obstetrician in the world couldn't have known she was going to give birth so soon."
He said that he never re-examined her because he was busy with another indigent emergency patient, and that he did not treat her on her return because he thought she had dismissed him from her case.
To prove dumping under the law, Dr. Burditt and the American Medical Association argue, the Government must show that the transfer was made in bad faith because the patient was poor.
"That kind of dumping exists, and it's wrong and it must be stopped," said Kirk Johnson, the association's general counsel. "If Dr. Burditt's medical judgment was wrong, and he made a mistake, he can be sued for malpractice. But there's already a crisis in finding good physicians to care for people in emergency rooms, and to have squads of Federal investigators getting into the malpractice business and second-guessing medical judgments is just going to make things worse."
Mr. Johnson said he believed that Dr. Burditt's decision to transfer Mrs. Rivera was based on liability concerns.
"Of course physicians are concerned about being sued, but that's the same thing as saying they're concerned about a bad outcome for the patient, that they don't want to do anything they're not competent to do," he said. "I believe that the defensive practice of medicine does create problems, both in cost and in access, but this law isn't the way to attack those problems, and defensive medicine isn't dumping."
The medical profession is particularly wary about turning the dumping law into another weapon for malpractice claimants, since the law provides that not just the Federal Government, but also private individuals who have been denied treatment, can file charges. But Mrs. Rivera is not involved in the Burditt case.
Dr. William McGanity, of the University of Texas at Galveston's obstetrics department, said the law, as interpreted by the Federal Government, made no sense in the context of rural Texas hospitals, where high-risk patients are routinely sent far away to more sophisticated hospitals. In that context, he said, Dr. Burditt was correct to order the transfer.
"I am not for a moment defending everything Mike Burditt did," he said. "I would wish that it had not taken two hours for Mrs. Rivera to be transported from DeTar. And since it did take so long, I would wish that she had been re-examined before the transport left. But I am not very comfortable with a system in which a Federal bureaucrat comes in afterwards and decides whether there was dumping. As the law is being interpreted, it's going to make it impossible to transfer any woman who is in labor."
Donald Wilcox, general counsel to the Texas Medical Association, said the law, as interpreted by the Federal Government, would actually reduce poor women's access to medical care, swamping small hospitals with high-risk babies who needed expensive intensive care, and creating such financial burdens that many hospitals would close. He said rural hospitals were already fearful that any patient transfer could lead to legal charges.
The Government calls that an unwarranted concern. "We're interested in prosecuting the most egregious cases, not questioning the fine points of medical judgments made in the hurly-burly of the emergency room," Mr. Astrue said. "What the law says is that if you go to emergency room in a crisis, you should not be transferred to another hospital for reasons that are not in your medical interests."
Brenda Willett, a lawyer with East Texas Legal Services, said many East Texas emergency rooms still denied treatment to poor women in labor. Ms. Willett has filed a brief on behalf of five other women who went to their local emergency room while in labor, and were turned away -- one of whom hemorrhaged and died in the ambulance on her way to Galveston.
"It's all inextricably intertwined, whether it's a fear of being sued or a fear of not being paid," Ms. Willett said. "If you're really concerned about a woman's health, you don't put her in an ambulance with no doctor, the riskiest situation. You'd never do that with a rich woman who needed to be transferred. She'd go in a helicopter accompanied by a doctor."

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR;
United Nations Eases Rules On Food and Fuel for Iraqis

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, March 22

 BODY:
The United Nations Security Council lifted its embargo on food supplies to Iraq today and eased restrictions on shipments of certain critical humanitarian goods including fuel for tucks and electrical generators.
These moves came after the United Nations said the allied bombing campaign had inflicted "near-apocalyptic" damage to Iraq's economy and threatened its people with "imminent catastrophe." 
 The Council committee administering the trade embargo decided those wishing to send food to Iraq may do so provided that they notify the committee at the time the shipment is made. This is the same system that has applied all along to medical supplies.
In addition, the committee decided that shipments of humanitarian goods, including fuel for generators, agricultural machinery and water purification and sewage treatment equipment, will be approved automatically if none of the 15 member states objects. Those wishing to send such goods must still notify the committee in advance. The full Council endorsed the committee's action later today, but Council approval was not necessary to lift the restrictions, because the committee is empowered to act alone in emergencies.
 
Cuba and Yemen Seek More
 Cuba and Yemen, two members who have opposed the United States' handling of the Gulf crisis, were defeated in their attempt to have all restrictions on food and humanitarian aid formally abolished, as United Nations Under Secretary General Martti Ahtisaari recommended in a report Thursday.
As a result, the original sanctions remain legally in effect, though with what amounts to a permanent exemption for foodstuffs.
The committee is expected to raise no objection to shipments of humanitarian goods, , diplomats say. But the United States maintains a veto right if it disagrees with a particular delivery.
Today's decision continues the gradual easing of trade restrictions since the end of the ground war.
 
Iraq Will Distribute Shipments
 Food and other goods sent to Iraq as a result of today's decisions will be distributed by the Iraqi authorities because the humanitarian organizations lack the means to do so.
But officials say these organizations will conduct spot checks to ensure supplies are reaching needy people in all parts of the country and are not being hoarded by the Iraqi army.
In Washington the Bush Administration expressed sympathy for the plight of the ordinary Iraqi people today and said it wants to help them.
"We're sympathetic towards the Iraqi and Kuwaiti people and others in the region for the hardships they have suffered at the hands of Saddam Hussein," said State Department spokesman Richard A. Boucher.
"Our main concern at this point is that humanitarian relief shipments actually reach the right people, the vulnerable civilian groups that are truly in need," he added.
 
No Guilt Seen for U.S.
 But Marlin Fitzwater, President Bush's spokesman, laid responsibility for the destruction in Iraq fully on Saddam Hussein and said, "You will not find America feeling guilty."
Mr. Fitzwater said that officials "have no way of knowing" if the damage was as severe as that described in the United Nations report, but that "that certainly was not our intent."
In any case, he aid, "I just simply reject the argument that somehow there is a guilt associated with the destruction of a war caused by Saddam Hussein."
"We fought the war decisively, we fought it well, and we fought it as discriminatingly as we could," Mr. Fitzwater said. "You will not find America feeling guilty for Saddam Hussein's invasion and destruction of his own people."
Some American diplomats questioned the Ahtisaari report's appeal for emergency fuel supplies to provide electricity for hospitals and water purification plants and to get transport services moving again.
They pointed out that the Iraqi Army has sufficient fuel and trucks to fight a civil war against the rebels trying to oust President Saddam Hussein and suggested the military should hand over supplies for civilian use.
 
U.N. Official Dodges Question
 When asked why he did not recommend the Iraqi army provide fuel and transport for humanitarian purposes instead of recommending an end to sanctions, Mr. Ahtisaari ducked the question at a press conference today.
He said his mission was only to assess Iraq's humanitarian needs "on the basis of what is available in the country" and that these needs could not be met without "addressing the country's underlying energy needs."
But he also said the Iraqi authorities are aware that the international response to his appeal for urgent assistance "will depend on how they handle the internal situation."
"The Iraqi authorities are aware they are under a magnifying glass," Mr. Ahtisaari added.
However the United States did not press its argument about the Iraqi army, diplomats say, in part because it feared that without some easing of the trade embargo today the Security Council might vote to abolish the sanctions altogether.
The United States does not want the trade sanctions against Iraq formally lifted until a new cease-fire resolution is approved and Baghdad has agreed to cooperate with its provisions.
The American draft requires Baghdad to agree to destroy its chemical and biological weapons, abide by its 1963 border agreement with Kuwait, create a mechanism for compensating victims of its aggression and return Kuwaiti detainees and stolen property. It also maintains an indefinite embargo on all military sales to Iraq.

HEADLINE: ALBANY TO ALLOW LARGER CLASS SIZE FOR HANDICAPPED

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:
New York State took a major step yesterday toward scaling back school programs for the handicapped by increasing maximum class sizes for students with learning disabilities.
The decision by the Board of Regents in Albany, which came over the objections of advocates for the handicapped and the state's teachers unions, is being watched by legislators and school administrators across the nation. Many have expressed frustration that during the fiscal austerity of a national recession they must confine many of their spending cuts to mainstream classes. 
 Special-education classes, as classes for the handicapped are known, are protected by Federal law, state mandates and court orders. Their enrollments have grown as troubled students whom teachers cannot handle have been referred there to receive counseling or individualized help.
 
4.2 Million Involved Nationwide
 There are now 4.2 million special-education students in the nation, about 12 percent of all schoolchildren. Most have been classified as learning-disabled or emotionally disturbed, though critics question how validly the terms are being applied.
William Schipper, executive director of the National Association of State Directors of Special Education, said the Regents' decision was the first that he knew of by any state to increase special-education class sizes. He said the decision would be studied by other states "just to see what people do with tight money."
The 16-member Board of Regents sets overall policy and standards for the state's public and private schools.
In New York City, 119,000 students are classified as handicapped -- one of every eight students in the city and roughly half of all such students in the state. Special education receives almost one of every four dollars spent on the city's schools. Of the total special-education enrollment, 70,000 students are classified as learning-disabled, a term that sometimes reflects neurological impairment but more often signifies a failure to reach intellectual potential.
The Regents' decision, which is not subject to any further review, yesterday raised the maximum class size for learning-disabled students to 15, from 12, and allowed some classes for severely handicapped students to grow to 8, from 6.
In practical terms, the decision to increase class size will mean that fewer teachers will be needed for the same number of children, creating enormous potential savings for financially strapped districts throughout the state. The State Education Department estimated that the changes will save $115.3 million statewide.
New York City will not increase class sizes for severely handicapped children, said Waldemar Rojas, the city's director of special education, because the cost of reclassifying children for larger classes -- which requires tests and interviews with psychologists and social workers -- would exceed any savings. Such reclassifications do not have to be performed with learning-disabled students.
State officials said children classified as severely handicapped include those with autism, multiple handicaps and emotional disturbances.
 
Bitter Opposition
 Joseph A. Fernandez, New York City's Schools Chancellor, who vigorously fought for the new rules, said the Regents' decision would save the city $29.4 million in the next school year, and other steps approved by the Regents would save about $10 million more. The city school system has been told it must cut $505 million from a projected budget of $7.568 billion.
The Regents also voted unanimously on a variety of other proposals to save money, including recommending to the State Legislature that the caseload for teachers who work with small groups of learning-disabled students pulled out of mainstream classes grow to 25 from 20. That is expected to save $8.9 million.
Advocates for the handicapped bitterly denounced the changes. Eli Nieman, education chairman of the Association for Neurologically Impaired-Brain Injured in New York City, said it was the "death knell" for learning-disabled children, and would place them in unwieldy groups where they could not get the help they need.
Describing classes of 15 as a "teaching nightmare," he said that students in special-education classes have been placed there because of a wide variety of dissimilar problems, including dyslexia, organic brain damage, mild retardation and lagging development. Those different problems need different instructional approaches, he said.
Mr. Nieman, principal of a Queens elementary school and a father of a brain-injured child, said many special-education teachers in the city are young and inexperienced.
 
'They Know Better'
 "Classes have become a hodgepodge," he said. "They are destroying these children and they know better."
The United Federation of Teachers also opposed the class-size increases.
Mr. Rojas, the city's director of special education, has defended the increase by noting that educational experts have never demonstrated what is an optimal class size. States like California have a 15-to-1 student-teacher ratio and do well, he said.
At a news conference yesterday, State Education Commissioner Thomas Sobol said, "If you had your druthers, in almost any case I can think of you would press for smaller classes rather than larger." But he noted that the state was "in the middle of a budget crisis," and said, "We're having to look at reductions all across the board."
He argued that the "changes we're proposing would not hurt handicapped kids," and "in many cases will improve their education." As an example, he said limiting the time children with mild learning disabilities -- who attend mainstream classes for most of the school day -- spend out of their classes might allow them to use their in-class time more productively.

HEADLINE: Lessons From a Budget Crisis

 BODY:
Mayor David Dinkins and Gov. Mario Cuomo are reacting to the downward spiral of New York's economy with more realism than they've displayed in the past. The New York City Mayor's call this week for concessions from city unions is a particularly welcome sign, and the Governor has proposed his own solutions to the latest downturn instead of waiting for the Legislature.
At least neither official is ducking. Yet neither is usefully exploiting the crisis to make the innovative, fundamental changes that could help New York get through the next recession. 
 The proposed remedies to the current fiscal crisis are little more than urgent versions of the usual -- a mix of budget cuts and higher taxes. Mr. Dinkins, anticipating a $3.1 billion budget gap in the next fiscal year -- $910 million higher than his earlier estimate -- proposes to cut services even more and demand givebacks from the city unions. The Mayor's new resolve is gratifying; until now, he's been unwisely protective of the unions. The test will be whether he follows through.
Mr. Cuomo also faces a growing deficit. He has proposed a new hodgepodge of one-shot savings, program delays and agency cuts. The Senate majority leader, Ralph Marino, complains a lot but offers no alternatives. Assembly Speaker Mel Miller rejects the Governor's call for an increased gasoline tax, argues that an income tax increase would be fairer, and suggests extending the fiscal year.
Some of these ideas have merit, and in the end budgets will emerge in both state and city. But last-minute drama and piecemeal approaches could produce genuinely harmful results and, in any case, are a poor answer to a floundering economy and years of statewide waste and mismanagement.
Government does not have to run this way. Except for Albany's move earlier this year to begin phasing out its spring borrowing, the city and state have failed to make fundamental changes. To do so will require the Mayor and Governor to stop sniping at each other, acknowledge that the city and state are inextricably linked, and work creatively together.
The state's costly Medicaid program, for example, needs restructuring rather than ad hoc cuts. Social services can be delivered more efficiently, helping recipients as well as government. So can education, including higher education. The city and state have to ask whether the state needs so large a state university system, and whether the city can continue to support its city university system and a huge municipal hospital network.
These are extraordinarily painful questions because they involve the relatively high level of services that New Yorkers have grown accustomed to. That was never clearer than last week, when a group of state university students, protesting pending tuition increases, resorted to inexcusably crude, violent tactics in the State Capitol.
But as difficult as it is to restructure government, it can be done. And because it has not been done, the city and state now find themselves dealing with severe fiscal problems in old-fashioned ways, at a punishing cost to the public.

HEADLINE: How About Puerto Rico's Self-Determination?;
Hidden Wealth

 BODY:
To the Editor:
As a former New Yorker who lives in Puerto Rico, I believe Tom Wicker's Feb. 9 column on statehood for Puerto Rico lacked basic facts about its political and social situation. I will discuss but one of his premises. 
 Mr. Wicker writes of the relatively low per capita income in Puerto Rico compared with the rest of the United States. There is poverty in Puerto Rico, though perhaps (since our total population is only three million) not so much as in New York City. Even by the official statistics, Puerto Rico has the highest per capita income in Latin America (that is, third behind the United States and Canada for the Western Hemisphere).
Mr. Wicker also describes Puerto Rico as the most important market for United States exports in Latin America, buying more goods than Argentina, Brazil and Chile combined. If three million Puerto Ricans import more United States products than 200 million people in South America (even given the high level of poverty in South America), there may be a problem with the per capita income statistic for Puerto Rico.
Few "mainlanders" know of the tax situation in Puerto Rico, which could contribute to this potential contradiction. Residents of Puerto Rico do not pay Federal taxes, but do pay a local income tax administered by the Commonwealth. It is well known that there is massive tax fraud in Puerto Rico. As an example, the average reported income for physicians or lawyers is $20,000 to $30,000 a year. This statistic was recently rejected by a jury in a Federal Court suit, and a figure closer to $150,000 a year was used to calculate a judgment. Similar disparities almost certainly exist.
In the United States, having a reported income disproportionate to your life style or the average income of your profession is a guaranteed way of producing an Internal Revenue Service investigation. This is not so in Puerto Rico.
Anyone who visits Puerto Rico and sees high-rise apartments and housing developments being built and sold at prices from $150,000 to $500,000 would be hard pressed to think this island has an economy vastly weaker than Mississippi's. This is to say nothing of the many Mercedeses, BMW's and other luxury cars commonly seen on our roads.
Another interesting statistic is that the highest-grossing stores in the Sears and J. C. Penney chains are in Puerto Rico. This is not a statistic you would associate with an economically depressed region.
There are also legal ways to defer a much larger percent of your total income in Puerto Rico than under I.R.S. regulations. For example, when I worked on the mainland, my ability to defer income was limited to a relatively small percent, while at my job in Puerto Rico I can defer up to 100 percent of my income. Thus, comparing per capita income figures calculated under two tax codes is mixing apples and oranges.
A more objective approach to the economic strength of Puerto Rico might be to calculate the per capita consumption of retail goods and services sold on the island, and compare this with other regions of the United States. You might find we are not so far from the rest of the United States as the per capita income figure would suggest.

HEADLINE: Top U.S. Auditor Criticizes Plan To Bolster Bank Insurance Fund

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 22

 BODY:
The Government's senior auditor today sharply criticized the Administration's proposal to bolster the dwindling bank insurance fund by extending its borrowing authority to $70 billion.
 In his first interview about the Treasury plan to reorganize the program that protects bank deposits, Charles A. Bowsher, the Comptroller General, said that extending the fund's borrowing ability was an unrealistic way of handling the growing crisis that would "ultimately hurt the Administration's credibility." 
Referring to the savings and loan bailout, Mr. Bowsher said, "I've been through taxpayer bailouts before and this is how they often get started." He is highly regarded on Capitol Hill for his nonpartisan and intense scrutiny of bank regulators and other Government agencies. His opinion could become a serious obstacle for Congressional passage of the Administration's plan.
 
Insolvency Seen in Year or Two
 Some officials have predicted that the $8.4 billion insurance fund will be insolvent within the next year or two. The fund is now at its lowest level in relation to deposits in the 57-year history of the insurance program.
 Fears of a taxpayer bailout of the bank fund were heightened on Thursday by the surprise disclosure by L. William Seidman, the chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, that the Administration was actually seeking $70 billion in borrowing authority, not the $25 billion it had said at the beginning of the week.
 Mr. Bowsher heads the General Accounting Office, the agency that audits and investigates Government programs for Congress. He said the G.A.O. would be issuing its recommendations to Congress for reorganizing the bank insurance fund within the next few weeks, but he declined to give any details today. The agency has been sharply critical of regulators for failing to take prompt action that could have avoided the failures of many banks.
 Mr. Bowsher said Congress would be "foolish" to increase the borrowing authority of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, instead of simply providing adequate funds and quantifying the actual losses. "The way to deal with this is up front and not through just increasing borrowing authority," he said.
 The Treasury plan, which has been presented as an effort to avoid the use of taxpayer funds, provides for a $25 billion credit line with the Federal Reserve and another $45 billion from the Federal Financing Bank, which coordinates financing activities of Federal agencies whose obligations are guaranteed by the Government.
 The plan envisions that all borrowings would be repaid through increases in premiums paid by banks to the insurance fund and the proceeds of sales of assets obtained by the Government from collapsed banks.
 
Mechanics of Borrowing
 The $45 billion lending authority would be accomplished by counting a $5 billion existing line of credit with the Treasury as equity. Under current law, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation can borrow up to nine times its existing equity.
 Mr. Seidman's disclosure has prompted some economists and critics from the banking industry to say the plan in effect permits regulators to borrow money that is secured by other borrowed money, not unlike using a Mastercard to repay a loan taken on a Visa card.
 "They blew it politically," said Robert E. Litan, an economist at the Brookings Institution who has come out in favor of borrowing $50 billion directly from the Treasury Deaprtment, not the way it has been proposed. "This smacks of gimmickry."
 Mr. Litan, who was a member of the Council of Economic Advisers during the Carter Administration, said the failure of Treasury officials to disclose the accurate size of their request at the beginning of the week reflected that they had either been playing down the magnitude of the problem because of the fear that it would be a replay of the highly unpopular savings and loan bailout or that they had simply been incompetent in the way they had described the plan.
 The F.D.I.C. insures bank accounts of up to $100,000 and would continue to do so even if the bank fund became insolvent. But if the borrowing plan was not adopted or was insufficient, then taxpayer funds might ultimately have to be used to protect those deposits.
Mr. Seidman has estimated that the rising rate of large bank failures would cost the bank insurance fund $30 billion to $35 billion over the next three years to protect depositors.
 Treasury officials denied today that they had deliberately sought to conceal the true size of the request, insisting that it was not a significant change in the borrowing authority of the F.D.I.C.
 Jerome H. Powell, Assistant Treasury Secretary for domestic finance, disputed Mr. Bowsher's assessment.
 "There are various sets of projections," Mr. Powell said. "Under any of them, this plan is adequate to solve the problem with industry contributions and without resorting to taxpayer funds."
 "There is no certainty on the ultimate size of the actual losses," he said. "But the plan is large enough to handle all the projections."

HEADLINE: WHAT'S DOING IN: Honolulu

BYLINE: By LENORE MAGIDA; LENORE MAGIDA, a journalist, lives in Honolulu.

 BODY:
After nearly 32 years of statehood, millions of visitors and vast transformation, Hawaii and its capital, Honolulu, still retain their aura of far-off tropical exotica. To many mainland residents, it seems, three decades of national togetherness are nothing compared with 3,000 miles of separation. Even the most sophisticated ask Hawaiian friends and relatives, "When are you coming to the States?" Visitors, especially in Honolulu, are surprised at the everyday American-ness, and perhaps even more startled that Honolulu has standard modern headaches -- for example, that it has, per capita, more two-career couples and more cars per mile of road than anywhere else in the country.
Even so, the image of paradise is grounded in reality. Though overbuilt, bumper-to-bumper and burdened, Honolulu has the cachet of being on a mid-Pacific tropical island. But the differences go deeper. In Honolulu, everyone is a part of a minority, but the majority of people are ethnically Asian. And though locals often tend to be ethnically insular, there really is something to the sometimes jaded "aloha spirit." 
 These days are difficult for many who earn their living marketing that spirit. Recession and war have hit hard at tourism, the largest and most important industry in the city and state. Officials expected the recession to cut business by 10 percent, but they've seen a drop of some 20 percent from last year. Moreover, many people from Hawaii's second-largest industry, the military, have gone to the gulf; not infrequently, their families have returned to mainland hometowns.
In Honolulu, the economy depends on tourists and off-duty military personnel. When they're around, good businesses typically do fine, even charging the notoriously high prices. Now, however, they're looking hard for customers; some are offering reduced rates, upgrades and the like.
In such circumstances, you might be tempted simply to bask on relatively empty Waikiki Beach. But Honolulu has other beaches, other attractions and a real life of its own that make it not just a tropical destination but an intriguing American city.
 
Diversions
 The East-West Center International Fair on April 7 features performances, exhibits and food from all over the region. The center, adjacent to the University of Hawaii in Honolulu, is a federally financed institution whose research and other programs are devoted to cultural and technical interchange between East and West; (808) 944-7715.
For an afternoon or evening of all-American recreation with a Hawaiian twist, try a University of Hawaii baseball game. The Rainbows are playing quite well this year. After playing host to the 16th Rainbow Easter Tournament from March 22 to 30, the Bows will have home games April 12 to 21 and May 10 through the month. The game is the same as anywhere else, of course, but sitting in Rainbow Stadium, glimpsing Diamond Head and nibbling with chopsticks at your bento (Japanese box lunch) is not. For ticket information call (808) 956-4481.
The first Hawaiian king, Kamehameha, will be honored on all islands from June 7 to 11 (June 11 is King Kamehameha Day). In Honolulu, there will be music, hula and a lei-draping ceremony on June 7 at the King Kamehameha statue across from Iolani Palace (the palace of the former Hawaiian royalty). On June 8 at 9:30 A.M. will be the 75th Annual King Kamehameha Celebration Floral Parade, ending at Kapiolani Park (next to Waikiki) with a hoolaulea, or cultural arts and crafts fair. Call (808) 586-0333 for information.
All year Honolulu offers many outdoor attractions. For example, the Waikiki Aquarium at 2777 Kalakaua Avenue (on the ocean, just opposite Kapiolani Park) houses a wealth of sea creatures. Its newest exhibit is a mahimahi hatchery, where visitors can see aquaculture at work and also get a look at the swift ocean fish that wind up on so many Hawaiian dinner plates. The aquarium conducts hikes, evening programs and other events. It is open daily 9 A.M. to 5 P.M. and requests a $3 donation; admission is free for children under 16.
Many American cities have a Chinatown, but Honolulu's feels different -- perhaps because of the intense ethnic mix, perhaps because the tropical setting makes it feel more like Asia. In any event, there is much to discover in this 15-block area -- markets, bakeries, herbalists, lei vendors, knickknack shops, historical buildings and more. In addition, though the area has hardly been gentrified, it has in recent years become home to quite a few art galleries and a growing number of trendy restaurants. It's an easy neighborhood to explore on your own (though some parts, especially Hotel Street, are best avoided at night) but, if you'd rather, the Chinatown Historical Society, (808) 521-3045, conducts free walking tours on weekdays.
 
Shopping
 Chinatown galleries and a number of shops elsewhere in Honolulu feature local artists and craftspeople whose work conveys -- through style, materials, colors, themes and other means -- the island ambiance and the Asian and Pacific influences. The variety is rich and the price range wide: a $9 set of a half-dozen abstract seascape notecards, $40 beach-glass earrings, calabashes (carved wooden bowls) and fiber baskets for $100 to $300, paintings and sculptures in the four-figure range. Some places to try: Pauahi Nuuanu Gallery, 1 North Pauahi Street (in Chinatown); Gallery EAS, 1426 Makaloa Street (one block behind Ala Moana Center); Nohea Gallery at Ward Warehouse; Following Sea at Kahala Mall.
Honolulu's museum shops are also good: the Shop Pacifica at the Bishop Museum, 1525 Bernice Street; the Academy Shop at the Honolulu Academy of the Arts, 900 South Beretania Street; the Museum Shop at the Contemporary Museum, 2411 Makiki Heights Drive.
 
Night Life
 Honolulu also has its own distinctive night life. For a lively and very dressed-down evening, try Anna Banana's, 2440 South Beretania Street, (808) 946-5190. On Fridays and Saturdays the house band is the excellent Pagan Babies. For a $5 cover you can stay until 2 A.M.
At a very different point on the entertainment spectrum are the Brothers Cazimero (Robert and Roland), who perform Tuesday through Saturday nights at the lovely, venerable Sheraton Royal Hawaiian Hotel, 2259 Kalakaua Avenue, (808) 923-7311. Residents admire the Caz for their integrity in performing -- and explaining -- genuine Hawaiian music in a tourist venue. Shows at 8:30 P.M., $59.95 for dinner and show; $25 for single cocktail and show; additional cocktail shows at 10:30 P.M. Friday and Saturday for $20.
 
Hotels
 There is never a shortage of hotels, and now there is also no shortage of available rooms. From sumptuous to Spartan, you can probably find whatever you want. The rates quoted are current, but be sure to check -- the deals may be improving.
The Sheraton Moana Surfrider, 2365 Kalakaua Avenue, (808) 922-3111, the first hotel in Hawaii, graces its oceanfront location with Old World splendor after its $50 million renovation two years ago. Double rooms, $185 to $285.
The newest addition to the luxury hotel scene is the Hawaii Prince Hotel, where every room faces the ocean. The hotel, at 100 Holomoana Street, (808) 956-1111, is next to the Ala Wai Yacht Harbor, just beyond which are the very popular Ala Moana Beach and the huge Ala Moana shopping center. Rates for doubles are $180 to $320; among the discounts is a 20 percent reduction for senior citizens.
For a lovely beachfront location beyond but still close to Waikiki, try the New Otani Kaimana Beach Hotel or the Colony Surf Hotel, both of which are at the foot of Diamond Head on Sans Souci Beach, at the end of Kapiolani Park. Double rooms are $105 or $120 at the Kaimana Beach, 2863 Kalakaua Avenue, (808) 923-1555. At the Colony Surf, 2895 Kalakaua Avenue, (800) 252-7873 or (808) 923-5751, they range from $125 to $285.
Budget choice: For fine budget accommodations, try the Hawaiiana Hotel. The Hawaiiana, 260 Beach Walk, (800) 367-5122 or (808) 923-3811, is a low-rise with lots of tropical flora surrounding a pool, and it prides itself on its knowledgeable staff. Double rooms are $85 or $95.
 
Dining Out
 There is more than one way to eat well in Honolulu. You can certainly find first-rate preparations of standard American and European fare. But it's usually more interesting to choose restaurants that take advantage of the Honolulu's qualities: its predominantly Asian-Pacific ethnic mix, its surrounding seas and its year-round growing climate.
Roy's, one of the most heralded of Honolulu's newer restaurants, draws customers to the suburb of Hawaii Kai with Roy Yamaguchi's distinctive, delicious way of drawing on Asian, Californian and Continental cuisines as well as local ingredients. There are always five or more fresh fish specials, along with such menu standbys as mesquite grilled ginger lime chicken. Dinner for two with a modest bottle of wine, about $90. Dinner daily starting at 5:30 P.M., last seating 9:45 P.M.; Sunday brunch 10 A.M. to 2 P.M. 6600 Kalanianaole Highway, (808) 396-7697.
Another deservedly praised chef-owner is Keo Sananikone, who has five Thai restaurants in Honolulu (three called Keo's, two called Mekong). The flagship restaurant, Keo's, at 625 Kapahulu Avenue, (808) 737-8240, abounds with flowers and celebrities. Dinner for two is about $60 with wine. The signature dish is Evil Jungle Prince, chicken or shrimp prepared with coconut milk, basil and red chilies. Open 5:30 P.M. to 11 P.M. daily.
Smaller, lower key, thoroughly pleasant in its own right is A Little Bit of Saigon, in Chinatown. Its owners, finding Hawaii the source of tropical herbs for their two Seattle restaurants, decided to open in Honolulu as well. Menu standouts include chao tom (broiled minced shrimp on sugar cane) and the two-person Seven Courses of Beef Banquet. Two people can eat well here for about $35. No liquor license, but you may bring your own drink. Open 11 A.M. to 11 P.M. daily. 1160 Maunakea Street, (808) 528-3663.
With its large Japanese population and usually huge number of Japanese tourists, Honolulu abounds in Japanese restaurants. For a wide variety of the freshest sushi, try Yanagi Sushi, 762 Kapiolani Boulevard, (808) 537-1525. Dinner for two, about $50. Open 11 A.M. to 2 P.M. and 5:30 P.M. to 3 A.M. (Sunday to 10 P.M.); that late closing is a special attraction in early-to-bed, early-to-rise Honolulu. A different sort of Japanese restaurant, but equally worthy, is Iroha Jaya, in the Kaimuki section. You can spend an entire evening on a Kaiseki feast, a traditional, many-course, Kyoto-style dinner that can cost, as they put it, "from $40 a person up to anything." Other choices are less expensive. Open 11 A.M. (except Sunday) and 5:30 P.M. to 9:30 P.M. 1048 Koko Head Avenue, (808) 732-1411.

HEADLINE: TV VIEW;
The Telly's Take On Americans? Texans All

BYLINE: By Russell Davies; Russell Davies writes about television and sports for The London Daily Telegraph and other publications.

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
British television viewers, especially those of a certain age, got a great kick out of the gulf war briefings of Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf. There are several reasons, and some are obvious: namely, that the general was our ally, that the news he brought was overwhelmingly positive, and that he was visibly nerved up to make his performances as dramatic as they were informative. But General Schwarzkopf also embodied a more nostalgic appeal, one that is slightly embarrassing for a Britisher to explain.
The fact is that he reminded us of an American we used to know -- in fact, the American we used to know, the American stereotype. From the moment we saw the bullish stride, the meaty face, the hot eyes and the peremptory finger jabbed in the direction of the trembling scribes, we felt at home with this person. We even felt we might have invented him, so perfectly did he correspond to a caricature of American-ness we have guiltily treasured for nearly 50 years. 
 This caricature was born, of course, in wartime, and nurtured by a low-level but persistent resentment of the American G.I., "overpaid, oversexed and over here," his pockets perpetually overflowing with chewing gum, cigarettes and nylon stockings, evidences of an economic ease we did not ourselves enjoy.
Victory removed the problem for a time, but later the G.I. returned to Britain as a plump tourist. He wore a shockingly loud checked jacket, a crew cut, a camera and a cigar, and he demanded, in unsubtle tones, to be shown the way to London Tower and the House of Parliaments and other not-quite-existent destinations. Such men, we believed, were all called Elmer or Floyd. It was ridiculous and unfair, but that's how caricatures are. We preferred our pet distortions of the truth to the truth itself. Americans with downbeat clothes, lank hair and an apologetic manner had to be somehow deficient in their own national hormone.
It would be pleasant to report that the days of distortion are over and gone, but not so: British television fictions, in particular, are still clinging to the stock figures. Even the very best of our output flirts dangerously with stereotypes. Witness "Edge of Darkness," the finest serial thriller Britain produced in the mid-80's, a winner of six awards from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts. The start of the story revealed itself as a brilliantly conceived film noir, set largely in the north of England and proving its single-mindedness by killing off Joanne Whalley (-Kilmer, as she later became) in the opening minutes.
Into this symphony of shadows, Joe Don Baker abruptly strode, wearing a broad-brimmed Dallas hat -- the kind with the crushed cage-bird plastered on the front -- and announcing himself as "Darius Jedburgh" (who?). "Howdy!" continued Mr. Jedburgh, adding, unnecessarily on the whole, that he had just got in from Texas. To be sure, the stereotype was introduced in this way so that we would later have the pleasure of discovering that the Jedburgh character did have some depth after all; but it was still a shock entrance, from which the mood of the piece took some time to recover.
Part of the trouble is that American characters always occur singly in British TV drama. In the days when home-grown actors took the "Yank" parts -- big, rumbustious Irishmen like Harry Towb and David Healy were the favorites -- we could afford to portray them in groups, but now we are ambitious enough to import real American actors, and they cost money. Frederic Forrest has been the latest to appear, in a serial called "Die Kinder" (PBS will show the six-part series beginning Thursday at 8 on "Mystery"). He plays one of those been-through-it-all-and-corrupted-by-most-of-it types who derive ultimately from Philip Marlowe (Raymond Chandler has a lot to answer for).
Michael Wearing, who produced "Edge of Darkness" and is now head of serials at BBC Television, has always favored American involvement. "If we can retain some sort of editorial integrity," he says, "there's nothing wrong in giving an American dimension to the work. If you're going to go in for an international approach at all, an American contribution is a lot easier to work with than any other, and there's a terrific subculture there that our audience is very educated about."
But not educated enough, according to Michael Grade, chief executive of the British Channel 4 (office-wall motto: "Collaboration"). Mr. Grade spent nearly four years in Hollywood and has often found himself squirming in the viewing theater while showing an American buyer his countrymen as perceived by British writers.
"In fiction," Mr. Grade says, "U.K. writers writing for the U.K. market never make an American character central, or properly developed. Americans are just dotted in, and frankly I think we're rotten at it. I don't believe most of the writers have been to America. Manhattan, Hollywood maybe, but there's never any feeling for places like Chicago, or Boston."
In Michael Wearing's opinion, however, the quirkiness of the parts for Americans has its attraction for the actors who fly over to play them. "I think it's a busman's holiday for many of them," he says. "They don't make fortunes, but they get to play parts that aren't relentlessly heroic all the time, in the Americans' own style. Sometimes, in fact, they play characters capable of criticizing the American internal system, political or cultural, and that's refreshing."
Everyone agrees that the age of the fake American, as played by a Briton with tortured vowels, is almost over. Ned Chaillet, a BBC Radio drama producer and a native of Washington, is particularly sensitive to these matters. (And he should be, for radio drama, at all levels from the classics to juvenile farce, is still a big thing in Britain. It's poorly paid, but actors love to do it.) Chaillet is currently casting a production of Noel Coward's "Design for Living," a play that is invaded by a troupe of American ladies in the last act. Listening to an archive tape of the last BBC production of the piece, he was shocked at how lamely the women were played by non-Americans ("just awful"). This time, he is hoping that Gayle Hunnicutt of Fort Worth (who is married to the editor of The Times of London) will lead the invading pack.
 Can we hope for similar care to be taken with newly written material, and on both sides of the Atlantic? Michael Grade of Channel 4 thinks not, and he extends his critique to include America's view of Britain.
"The basic rule, on both sides," says Mr. Grade, "is that foreigners are funny. You look at any Hollywood-made entertainment. If there's a British character in it, he's going to be either a butler, or something royal, a prince. And not even the butlers are right. Years ago, we had a famous series called 'Upstairs, Downstairs,' about life in an aristocratic Edwardian household with lots of domestic staff.
"CBS took this up and made it into a thing called 'Beacon Hill,' " which, he says, he and his colleagues agreed, missed the nuances of the original because "the American networks' idea of the complexities of the master-servant relationship is, basically, room service."
Perhaps both sides could agree on a set of elementary rules and prohibitions. America could cut out the butlers; we could abolish the Stetsons and bow ties (all Americans in "Inspector Morse" are professors with bow ties). In this way we might begin to creep reciprocally toward the complexity that is truth. In the meantime, we, on our side, can give only one guarantee: that, fond though we are of documentary drama, we shall not be employing any Brits to play General Schwarzkopf.

HEADLINE: ARCHITECTURE VIEW;
Baron Haussmann, Urban Designer Par Excellence

BYLINE: By Martin Filler; Martin Filler, who frequently writes about architecture, is a contributing editor of Conde Nast Traveler, HG and Vanity Fair.

 BODY:
If any city plan can be seen as the environmental expression of national characteristics, then Paris is among the most obvious. It is a veritable diagram of the French proclivity for centralization, rationalism and prestige. It is also proof of what one dynamic individual can do to reshape a city, a kind of leadership many people long for today, as our urban problems often seem insurmountable, especially through design.
 The man who created Paris as we now know it died there 100 years ago this past January at the age of 81. But the legacy of Baron Georges-Eugene Haussmann, city planner nonpareil, has long outlived him. For historians and critics in recent years, opinion has been sharply divided. Was Haussmann the selfless benefactor of civic progress seen by his admirers, or a cynical promoter of a new consumer culture, as seen by Marxist critics? Did he illuminate the City of Light or vandalize the historic bourg of Louis IX, Saint and King of France? Did his policies stimulate social responsibility or increase class divisions? Since his death, his reputation has fluctuated with the political climate. None, however, can dispute his importance. 
 The current sad state of city planning has stimulated revisionist enthusiasm for Haussmann. The French urban historian Francois Loyer, in his 1988 book, "Paris: 19th Century," summed up that school of thought. "As far as I can see," he wrote, "a neo-Haussmann approach is the only one capable of reunifying Paris. [It is] much less perverse than the post-modernists' anguished derision of cultural tradition. There is nothing wrong with going back to something that worked."
 From 1853 to 1870 as prefect of the Seine -- director of public works for the Paris region -- Haussmann energetically attacked and largely solved many of the ills caused by the rapid and tremendous growth of the commercial center and social lodestone of France. His urban design program was second to none in modern times. Demolishing some 12,000 structures, cutting 85 miles of new direct roadways through the city to replace 333 miles of meandering old ones, erecting imposing landmarks like the Opera and the Halles Centrales, revamping the antiquated and unhealthy water and sewage systems, increasing the number of street lights and sidewalks, and establishing parks equal to contemporary schemes in London and New York, Paris under Haussmann was in an almost constant state of construction upheaval.
 The broad, light-filled, tree-lined thoroughfares that became his hallmark perfectly illustrate the multiplicity of purpose that always underlay the efforts of this protean pragmatist. Haussmann's boulevards, for the most part angled across existing streets and linked together at diagonals, served many different functions. They connected the city's new train terminals more efficiently, allowed the quick deployment of troops in case of revolts like those of recent memory in 1830 and 1848, and "disemboweled" the troublesome neighborhoods where those rebellions traditionally fomented. They also permitted the more expedient transport of goods and services around town as the local economy shifted from small artisans working near their homes to an industrialized system spread over a wide area. Finally, they gave shape to the eight new arrondissements Haussmann added around the periphery of Paris, and set up an extendible matrix for future growth.
 Apolitical but opportunistic, authoritarian but flexible, he was a Janus-like figure. He looked back to Louis XIV's Grande Epoque for the Baroque planning ideal of plazas, radial avenues and junctures, like the Etoile. At the same time, he looked ahead to the 20th century with his concern for sanitary engineering, zoning regulations protecting access to light and air, and even an unfulfilled proposal for a greenbelt surrounding Paris (although by no means was he a crusader for society's dispossessed).
 Esthetics was not neglected. Despite what Haussmann called his "piercings" -- it was said that he tore down half of Paris to build up the other half -- few significant landmarks were razed. Whenever he could, Haussmann made those noble survivors the termination points of his new vistas, and where needed he commissioned churches, monuments and set-pieces to give closure to a boulevard or intersection.
 Among the public who know and love Paris there are mixed responses to Haussmann's urbanism. To some, the city's beauty rests in its dignity and consistency, its symmetry and order. To others, the architectural pleasures of Paris lie far from Haussmann's grand boulevards lined with long stretches of gray, elephantine buildings. Those endless stone-faced apartment houses -- uniform, decorous, and monotonous -- were his quintessential structures, the foundation of his conception of Paris as a paradise for the bourgeoisie. But a great deal else was subjugated to gain such extraordinary unity. No other great city has so little modulation of color, material, texture and scale as Haussmann's Paris.
 To those who prefer the intimacy, diversity and charm of the quarters that escaped Haussmann's monumental will, like the Marais and much of St.-Germain, he is less than a hero. Thus when people say they like the Left Bank better than the Right Bank, they mean more than just architecture and planning before and after Haussmann. They are also acknowledging that one of Haussmann's most enduring effects was to make once-mixed milieus socially homogeneous. In his rebuilt and new neighborhoods, a cross section of rich, middle-class, and poor people no longer lived in the same streets, and the emergent notion of the economically segregated community prevailed. Real estate interests demanded that their investments be protected, and by insuring that at the expense of all taxpayers, Haussmann was less public servant than social engineer.
 Certainly, Haussmann's urban removals now seem like nothing compared to those proposed by Le Corbusier in his never-executed Voisin Plan of 1925, in which several square miles of the Right Bank north of the Ile de la Cite would have been flattened to make way for a phalanx of 18 megastructures. Equally, Haussmann's insistence on formal coherence and visual solidity are a reproach to the late-modernist chaos of La Defense, the cluster of garish office towers that started rising during the 1970's beyond the western terminus of the Champs-Elysees. And President Francois Mitterrand's "grands projets," the most formidable architectural undertaking in Paris since Haussmann, have produced very little that seems likely to withstand the test of time as well as Haussmann's constructions.
 In sheer determination and ability to bring ideas to reality, Haussmann's truest heir was Robert Moses, the longtime New York public works chief. The two master builders were alike in their prodigious administrative capacities, their grasp of popular taste, their understanding of finance and its relation to government, and their willingness to let the private sector profit greatly from public works.
 Nor could either of them fathom why the public did not appreciate the logic behind his most extreme forays, which in both cases exacted high human costs. Haussmann uprooted the Latin Quarter to build the Boulevard St.-Michel in the 1850's, just as in the 1950's Moses wrecked the East Tremont section of the Bronx to make way for the Cross Bronx Expressway, the sunken highway that set up a more unbreachable boundary than even the widest of Haussmann's boulevards. For all the admirable contributions those planners made to the cities they served, respect for democratic procedures was never their strong suit.
 In retrospect, the uncomfortable conclusion appears to be that these incomparable architectural activists cared little about the suffering of a single generation if they thought that future generations stood to benefit. Perhaps that is inevitable among those who begin with great visions and then work down to individuals, rather than seeing the basic unit of a city's greatness in its people, not its monuments.

HEADLINE: Globalism and Us

 BODY:

To the Editor:
It is disconcerting when a reviewer uses his allotted space as a forum for propounding his own idiosyncratic notions. In his eagerness to argue that the emerging global economy doesn't have much impact on Americans (an idea that contradicts evidence showing that 70 percent of America's manufacturing base and most of its business services are now exposed to foreign competition), the economics journalist Robert J. Samuelson barely deals with the book under review. That book is mine -- "The Work of Nations: Preparing Ourselves for 21st-Century Capitalism" (March 10), which examines the social and political consequences of the global forces now acting upon us.
In the one place where Mr. Samuelson does attempt to test his odd idea that globalism doesn't matter -- using his own job as a columnist at Newsweek as an example -- he blunders badly. "If . . . I'm ever fired, I'll be pounding the doors of other American publications," he writes, as evidence of his apparent insulation from the global economy.
But Mr. Samuelson will be walking the streets for a long time if he limits his job search to American publications. I'd recommend that he consider a job with France's Hachette S.A. (which publishes Woman's Day, along with a number of other popular magazines), or Rupert Murdoch's Australian-based News Corporation (TV Guide, HarperCollins, etc.), or perhaps Germany's Bertelsmann media empire (owners of Bantam Dou bleday Dell). If he has no luck with any of these, Mr. Samuelson might turn to any one of the thousands of foreign-based magazines, newspapers and newsletters that hire legions of Americans to explain to their readers what's happening in the United States. I'd also recommend one of the many foreign-based newsmagazines whose American readership is growing at the expense of newsmagazines like the one that now employs him. (I, for one, don't get my economics news from Newsweek. I rely on The Economist -- published in London.) Or he may want to consider a job with Time magazine, now part of the Time Warner global media conglomerate. Unbeknown to him, Mr. Samuelson has indeed become a participant in the new global economy -- exactly the sort of person I have written about -- whose job depends to an ever greater extent on what happens outside the United States.
But I sincerely hope that Mr. Samuelson is not fired. He is an able journalist, even if mistaken in disputing the global dimensions of the new economy.

HEADLINE: PERSONAL ACCOUNT;
Japanese Enlightenment

BYLINE: By SAMA KUSUMOTO; Sam Kusumoto is president of Minolta Corporation, the American subsidiary of Japan's Minolta Camera Corporation. His book, "My Bridge to America," was recently published in Japan.

 BODY:
I vividly recall my flight into New York in 1954, at age 26, as Minolta's first representative in the United States. Night was falling, and I could see a bluish glow spreading over the city from its neon heart, Times Square. It was a stark contrast to my Japanese homeland, which was still so poor that, even in Tokyo, electricity was rationed and lights burned feebly for only a few hours each night. Tokyo's prewar commercial center, the Ginza, was only then beginning to recover from the devastation of World War II.
 I find myself remembering that night whenever I hear Americans decry Japan's economic "invasion" of the United States. My experience suggests that, financial motivations notwithstanding, the Japanese interest in things American is much more complex than many people in the United States might suspect.
 Shortly after the war, I had the humbling experience of walking through the Ginza. Sidewalk peddlers had replaced the famous, now bombed-out, stores. And American military police, filling in for destroyed traffic lights, directed the flow of cars from a raised platform in the center of the main intersection.
 The tall, handsome and healthy GI's, wearing crisp olive uniforms with brilliant white helmets, took turns directing traffic with choreographic flair. Young Japanese women admired the style and authority of those Americans, then cast sidelong glances at underfed Japanese men like me, who waited to cross the street with bowed heads and shabby clothes, jealous of the Americans, knowing we could not compete. The seeds of Japan's postwar recovery may have been sown there in the Ginza in 1946.
 America's generosity ran far deeper than gifts of nylon stockings to the young women. During the six-and-a-half years following Japan's surrender, the economic help and political liberalization the United States provided under Gen. Douglas MacArthur's rule enabled my country to revive its economy, and the confidence that our ill-advised war had shattered.
 Minolta, where I went to work not long out of Keio University, benefited from MacArthur's determination to rebuild domestic industries - and, in the case of camera manufacturers, the general's desire to give his soldiers something to spend money on besides booze, gambling and skirt-chasing. In effect, our sales to the military post exchanges were our first "exports."
 Growing up in the late 1920's and early 30's in what was then the Japanese city of Korea, I developed a great admiration for America. My father, the Ford Motor Company's distributor for the entire colony, was known as "the Henry Ford of Korea."
 When I was sent to the United States in the '50's, my mandate was to expand Minolta's sales to the world's richest customer market. And, as I made my way in New York, I struck up friendships with other young Japanese men here on similar missions from other Tokyo- and Osaka-based employers. We didn't have much money and we whiled away many an evening in the Times Square area. I marveled at the block-long Bond clothing store sign with its flowing waterfall flanked by giant statues of a man and a woman, the replica of a T.W.A. airliner with wings outstretched over Seventh Avenue, and my favorite, the Camel cigarette sign with a man blowing smoke rings.
 Times Square had begun to go dark by the time I was sent back to the United States to be president of the marketing subsidiary in 1969. Broadway's fading lights were symptomatic of the deterioration of New York City in those years; by the 1970's, the night sky over Tokyo was brighter than New York's. The story of what happened next may illuminate, if you will, the controversy surrounding recent Japanese investment in America.
 In my conversations with other Japanese businessmen in New York, I discovered that many of us shared similar career paths and a nostalgic attachment to Manhattan. We struck a gentlemen's agreement to relight Times Square.
 We considered giant neon signs a good advertising medium and believed Times Square to be perhaps the best location in the United States. Our companies were doing well, thanks to the openness of the American market and the buying power of American consumers; what better way to symbolize our achievements in that market than to revive one of its vernacular art forms.
 Sony was first, with its giant sign at the south end of the square in 1972. Fuji, TDK and others followed. There were more than a dozen Japanese companies represented at Times Square by the time Minolta, in 1983, secured the northern facade of 1 Times Square Plaza.
 Since 1907, this building, which once housed the New York Times, has been the site of the annual dropping of the giant ball at midnight on New Year's Eve. Our sign's Broadway premiere was, up to then, the only time other than New Year's Eve that the ball had been lowered from the tower. One magazine headline announced, "Japanese Invade Times Square," and a newspaper attacked us for "commercializing" the New Year's Eve tradition.
 It wasn't as if we were driving the Americans out. The American advertisers had largely deserted Times Square. In fact, following the Japanese "invasion," American firms like Pepsi, Kodak and others - including Camel cigarettes - returned to Times Square with dazzling signs.
 I think about that when I read the headlines about the "invading" Japanese. American investment has benefited the economies of many countries. As the United States now wrestles with a recession, I hope more Americans will welcome investments that foster growth. I've learned from experience that foreign investments can help to keep the lights burning. Not just im Times Square and the Ginza, but all around the world.

HEADLINE: Jersey's 'Gold Coast' Losing Its Glitter

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
THE New Jersey shore of the Hudson River, which emerged in the mid-80's as a powerful new magnet for high-rise office development, is struggling with high vacancy rates, canceled projects and nagging doubts about the capacity of its roads, parking and public transportation.
No area better symbolized the 80's real estate boom in the New York region. An 18-mile corridor of gritty piers, derelict warehouses and abandoned railroad yards, the New Jersey riverfront became a patchwork of huge development sites. 
 It also became the focus of a feisty battle for New York City tenants and the centerpiece of an urban renaissance so sweeping that some began calling the area the "Gold Coast" of New Jersey.
For now, the renaissance has slowed. With 15 million square feet of space -- more than half of it built in the last five years -- developers on the New Jersey shore are beset by the highest vacancy rates in the New York area.
"When the Manhattan market became soft, it really hurt the New Jersey waterfront," said Peter Eppie, managing director of Edward S. Gordon Company of New Jersey, a commercial brokerage, based in Jersey City. In an analysis this month, it found office vacancies in New Jersey's Hudson River cities running at more than 30 percent, nearly double those in Manhattan.
With such large blocks of offices to be filled, an even bigger vision for the waterfront is being put on hold.
"I like to think of it as a glass that is only a third full," said Herman Volk, director of the Governor's Waterfront Development Office, established in 1984 to promote and coordinate the development plans of Jersey City, Hoboken, Weehawken and other cities swept up in the boom. In all, he said plans have been laid for more than 20 million square feet of new offices in the area.
"The question now is how much of that planning becomes reality," Mr. Volk said. "The first order of business now is to fill up existing space."
While office developers are struggling, others who plan to remake the sparsely populated waterfront area into a major new center of luxury housing have also been mired in financial setbacks and delays. By 1987, more than a half dozen large residential communities were planned from southern Jersey City to the George Washington Bridge, including 16,000 new town houses and apartments.
SO far, only 3,600 have been built, according to an analysis by the Governor's Waterfront Development Office.
One troubled residential project is Port Liberte, a development that may ultimately include 1,690 town houses and apartments on a series of shorefront canals in Jersey City, just west of the Statue of Liberty. With only 300 of the homes completed, the project's developer, Paul W. Bucha, president of Port Liberte Partners of Jersey City, ran into severe financial trouble in 1989 and stopped building. One of his major lenders, CityFed Financial Corporation of Somerset, N.J., attributed a loss of $52.7 million to its bad loans to Port Liberte, and its assets were later seized by Federal regulators.
Now, despite widespread reports that Asian investors stand ready to take over the Port Liberte project, its fate is in the hands of the Resolution Trust Corporation, the Federal agency charged with rescuing the nation's failed thrift institutions.
For home builders and office developers alike, the immediate problem is something far from unique to the Hudson riverfront -- the economics of a deep real estate recession. Since most of the office developers in the area have designed their buildings to appeal to banks, securities firms and other financial-services companies in Manhattan, they are now trying to sell to companies that are eliminating workers and shedding office space.
They are also competing with Manhattan office buildings that can no longer command the lofty prices of the mid-80's. Surveys show that the price of new office space along the New Jersey shore is now running at an average of $22 to $23 a square foot, nearly $10 less than in new Manhattan buildings but no more than is being asked in older buildings in the Wall Street area and on Midtown Manhattan side streets.
Some real estate executives say the slump could be a short one. Because taxes and energy costs are lower in New Jersey than in New York City and because of the riverfront's sweeping views and access to two separate lines of the PATH railroad system into Manhattan, they maintain that the development boom is bound to resume.
"Our feeling is that these buildings on the New Jersey shore stand to gain more when things come back," said Rose Perrizo, senior vice president of Landauer Associates, a real estate consulting firm based in Manhattan.
With large undeveloped sites still available, and intensely competitive efforts to attract corporate tenants by builders and some municipalities along the Hudson River waterfront, she said, high-technology office buildings will be available at bargain rents, at least compared to Manhattan.
Nor has the real estate downturn brought an end to the trans-Hudson migration of Manhattan companies.
In the largest recent New Jersey coup, Merrill Lynch, the securities firm, has leased half of 101 Hudson Street, a 43-story, 1.1 million-square-foot office tower nearing completion next to the Exchange Place complex in Jersey City.
"We found this the most appropriate site, both from a financial and functional point of view," said Fred Yaeger, a spokesman for Merrill Lynch, which plans to move 2,500 data processors to the new building by the end of 1992. He added that the company will save $100 million over the first five years of its Jersey City lease, compared to what it would have cost to renew its current lease at One Liberty Plaza in lower Manhattan.
The Exchange Place area, directly across the Hudson from the World Trade Center, is so far the most heavily developed office section on the New Jersey riverfront. A key advantage, analysts say, is its access to a newly renovated Exchange Place station of the PATH system. That makes offices in the area an easy commute from lower Manhattan and several New Jersey cities.
Harborside, a 1.9 million-square-foot complex completed next to the Exchange Place station in 1989, is 80 percent leased with large tenants, among them Bankers Trust Company and the Bank of Tokyo. Exchange Place Center, a neighboring high rise with 700,000 square feet, is 85 percent leased and anchored by the National Westminster Bank of New Jersey.
The shoreside development surge, still in its infancy, has felt serious growing pains. In Jersey City, despite its access to the PATH system, automobile traffic has become a daily nightmare for thousands of workers trying to wind their way along side streets leading to the waterfront from the New Jersey Turnpike.
"Infrastructure improvements, including transportation, have not kept pace with the rapid development," said a report by the Jersey City Planning Department in 1989.
For those who cannot ride PATH or other public transporation to work, commuting has become "particularly difficult, if not impossible," the report added.
Little has been done since 1989 in Jersey City or other riverfront municipalities to increase public transportation, but plans have been laid.
Congress last year appropriated $20 million for public transporation in the area. The Governor's Waterfront Transportation Office, established in 1987, said the money would be used to improve bus service along a seven-mile stretch of waterfront where most office buildings have been built or are planned, from southern Jersey City to Weehawken.
A more ambitious plan, advocated by municipal officials and developers for years, is for a new, above-ground rail line connecting the waterfront communities and new developments. But that plan, like the those of several office developers, is now on hold.
"Some sort of light rail system is very much favored by citizens here, but financing it will be a major hurdle," said Martin Robins, director of the Waterfront Office. He estimated that the rail line would cost $250 million to $500 million.
Some proposed developments are being stalled by public opposition. In Hoboken, an on-again, off-again plan to develop idle riverfront land and piers that are owned by the city and leased to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey was sent back to the drawing boards in October. The plan, involving a huge development of 1.3 million square feet of offices, hundreds of condominiums, a hotel and a marina, was defeated by only four votes in a municipal referendum. Now, Hoboken and Port Authority officials say they are preparing a plan for a smaller development.
In another stalled Hoboken development, the Stevens Institute of Techology, whose 55-acre campus overlooks the Hudson from atop the Palisades, abandoned a plan for 540,000 square feet of new offices a year ago. The offices were to have been built on land the institute owns below the Palisades, with two 12-story buildings starting from its base and rising above it, and was fiercely opposed by environmentalists and others in Hoboken.
IN a new plan, Stevens now says it is looking for investors in a "technology pavilion" that would be built on its campus to attract the research and development operations of large corporations.
"We decided that our business is technology, not real estate development," said Harold J. Raveche, the Stevens president. Nonetheless, he added, the region's real estate slump and waterfront traffic problems are standing in the way of a major resurgence of office construction.
"If we solve our transportation and parking problem, we have a boom town," he said.
Elsewhere along the New Jersey riverfront, office developers are either postponing their plans or struggling to find tenants.
Perhaps hardest hit by the downturn has been the Newport Office Tower, a 36- story, million-square-foot office tower in the 270-acre Newport complex in northern Jersey City, which also includes five residential towers and a major shopping mall. More than half the building was to have been leased by The Limited, a clothing store chain based in Manhattan, but it backed out after construction began last spring.
The building, to be completed in August, now has no tenants.
"We have several major proposals," said Edwin H. Cohen, executive vice president of William A. White/Grubb & Ellis, a brokerage that is marketing the building. He added that two large companies, one a financial services company in Manhattan, may soon sign leases, each for over 100,000 square feet.
Plans for another large Jersey City office tower were dropped last year, when the Vector Real Estate Corporation of Manhattan decided not to build the Liberty Center, a 980,000-square-foot building that was to have been built two blocks west of Exchange Place. Vector let its site plan, which had been approved by Jersey City officials, expire.
SOME analysts say the slowdown in development may ultimately benefit the Hudson River waterfront cities.
"Now is the time for planning," said Richard Bass, the former planning director of Jersey City who resigned in 1989 to become deputy director for land use planning in the office of Manhattan Borough President Ruth W. Messinger.
Because of the frenetic pace of proposals and construction over the last five years, he said, it was all but inevitable that the long-term impact on parking, traffic and other parts of the waterfront would fail to receive proper attention.
"When you start to impose New York City scale development on a small-town planning mentality, it is bound to lead to problems," he said.
At the Governor's Waterfront Transportation Office, Mr. Robins said a slower pace of development for as long as four years might benefit the area.
"The waterfront is going to grow over a period of many years, and this may be the time to fill in gaps, to unify the area," he said.
"I hope we use the time well," he added. "If development moves more slowly until the middle of the 90's, we can lay a good foundation for it."

Rent-Rise Exemptions
 
Question: I live in a rent-stabilized apartment and would like to know about the rent-increase exemption program for senior citizens. Where can I get information? . . . Claire D. Taylor, Floral Park, Queens 1
 
Answer: Call the New York City Housing Preservation and Development Department's rent-exemption office at 240-7000. Some Nassau and Westchester municipalities also offer exemptions to their residents. The State Division of Housing and Community Renewal provides information on those programs at (516) 481-9494 and (914) 948-4434. Thomas R. Viola, spokesman for the division, said regulated localities grant full or partial exemptions from rent increases to tenants 62 years of age or older who meet varying local income limits. In New York City, the limit is $15,000, but certain expenses can be excluded. Landlords are compensated for the lost rent through reductions in their tax bills.
 
Co-op Rental Liability
 
Question: The owner of the co-op we rent told us when we moved in that the air-conditioner was not installed, but instead balanced on the windowsill. When an unaware guest raised the window, the air-conditioner crashed to the ground. Luckily, no one was injured. Now the landlord says he will deduct its price from our security deposit. We believe he was negligent. Are we responsible? . . . Lynn O'Kelley, Manhattan
 
Answer: Probably not. Michael R. Finder, a housing lawyer in Manhattan, said both sides were negligent, but standard leases generally hold landlords responsible for maintaining major appliances. You could sue in Small Claims Court to recover any withheld security money. Vahe Tiryakian, spokesman for the New York City Buildings Department, said the Building Code in general requires owners to maintain safe buildings. Specifically, Local Law 10, the facade safety law, requires owners of buildings over six stories to have the exterior walls and appurtenances -- including air-conditioners -- inspected every five years.
 
Co-op Tax Deductions
 
Question: What determines tax deductions on co-ops? Do all apartments in a building, regardless of size, have the same deduction? Can the deduction change? If so, what would cause that? . . . L. Landis, Manhattan
 
Answer: In nearly all co-ps, the co-op corporation may allocate to each owner-resident a proportionate share of what it pays each year for local property taxes and interest on the building's mortgage. Residents may then deduct their shares of the building's payout from their taxable income along with whatever interest they pay on their own apartment mortgages.
The size of the shares is determined by the size and location of the apartments. Larger apartments and those on higher floors usually pay more in maintenance charges each month and consequently they get larger income tax deduction shares. The shares are fixed, but the taxes paid by the building may change annually because of changing assessments and tax rates. The mortgage interest is more stable but also may change if the rate is adjustable or if the loan is refinanced.
Mark B. Shernicoff, a Manhattan accountant and treasurer of the Council of New York Cooperatives, said co-op managements notify stockholders of their allowable deductions early each year so they may meet the April 15 income-tax deadline. He said deductibility is often expressed as a percentage of the maintenance fee. Or it may be given as a dollar amount for each share of the corporation's stock held by an owner.
Homeowners, including co-op owners, may claim deductions for only two residences, Mr. Shernicoff said.

HEADLINE: Legislators Gird for a Marathon of Tax Talk

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
ON Tuesday, the public speaks. Those who think that Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr.'s plan for a 6 percent income tax will help solve the state's financial woes -- and those who don't -- can take a number and line up.
For one day only, members of the General Assembly's Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee will conduct a public hearing to allow formal comment by all comers. The testimony will be entered into the record and presumably will be given due consideration in the final tax plan that emerges from the committee next month. Committee members are already bracing themselves for a marathon. 
 "We presume that we will have the mother of all hearings," said State Representative Miles S. Rapoport, a Democrat from West Hartford and a member of the Finance Committee. Mr. Rapoport, a longtime supporter of the concept of a tax on income, proposed an alternative wage tax formula last week, saying he hoped it would draw rave reviews at the hearing and supplant Mr. Weicker's proposal.
The Rapoport plan, co-sponsored by two other members of the committee, would tax wages on a sliding progressive rate that would range from 4 percent for adjusted gross family income over $25,000 to 9 percent for families earning $150,000 or more. Mr. Rapoport said that his plan would spare some middle-income taxpayers from the abrupt increase that they would face under the Weicker proposal. The Governor's proposed tax rate of 6 percent would apply to all family income over $25,000, or $12,500 for an individual.
There are other tax plans and other agendas. But people across the political spectrum agree that the Finance's Committee's work this year could mark a turning point for Connecticut, and that Tuesday's hearing will be a rare opportunity for people outside the political system to be heard.
Governor Weicker, who took office in January, argues that taxes paid by business must be cut to stimulate the economy, and that the long-shunned income tax is the only sound way to allow those tax cuts while making up the huge revenue shortfall in the state's budget caused by the recession.
Opponents of the income tax say it would open the door to unrestrained spending growth by the legislature, that it would make Connecticut less attractive for highly paid executives and artists who have moved to the state over the years, and that it would throw away forever an element of the culture that separates the state from its neighbors. Connecticut is one of only 10 states with no broad-based tax on wages.
Between those two poles lie a vast array of compromise plans and subplots, many of which are expected to receive their first public debate when the doors open at 10 A.M. in Room 2-C of the Legislative Office Building.
Governor Weicker's plan would lower the tax rate on corporate profits from 13.8 percent to 11.5 percent and lower the state sales-tax rate from 8 percent to 4.25 percent. (But it would increase the number of taxable transactions to include gasoline purchases, haircuts and automobile repairs.) Taxes on dividends, interest and capital gains would be eliminated, with all income to be taxed at the flat 6 percent rate for adjusted gross income over $25,000 for a family and $12,500 for an individual.
In addition to the Governor's plan, the most attention is expected to be focused on proposals from the Finance Committee and from Mr. Rapoport and his supporters. The committee's proposal would avoid an income tax and keep the sales tax at 8 percent, but the sales tax would be expanded to include various new purchases. Among the list of potential new targets for the sales tax -- in addition to the items like gasoline that are also in the Weicker plan -- are home utilities like electricity, water, natural gas and heating oil, plus legal, accounting and transportation services. All would be subject to the 8 percent tax.
The committee plan -- which has not been endorsed by any of its members, who said they were offering it primarily for discussion purposes at the hearing -- would leave most of the state's other taxes as they are and would result in up to $300 million in new taxes for businesses. Mr. Weicker has already said that figure is intolerable and would provoke a veto.
The Governor has said that he does not necessarily want an income tax, but that he would send back any alternative that does not achieve the same result: cuts in taxes to business without resorting to short-term solutions or excessive borrowing.
The plan known as the Progressive Alternative has been proposed by Mr. Rapoport along with two other Finance Committee members, Geri W. Langlois, a Democrat from Thompson, and Ernest E. Newton 2d, a Democrat from Bridgeport. Their proposal would lower the sales tax to 4.75 percent over two years, and create a $250 million system of property tax credits that would be paid directly to taxpayers.
 
Restoring Funds to Budget
 Mainly because the sales tax would not be reduced as much under the Rapoport plan as under Mr. Weicker's, the package would raise enough money to maintain the current sales tax exemptions for gasoline, clothing that costs under $75 and car repairs. It would also allow for $285 million to be restored in spending for unspecified "critical" programs that were cut in Mr. Weicker's budget.
What may not be discussed at the hearing is an alternative plan being formulated by the General Assembly's Republicans, who are the minority party in both chambers. On March 14, the vice-chairman of the Finance Committee, State Senator James H. Maloney, a Democrat from Danbury, appealed to the Republicans to have their plan finished in time for Tuesday's hearing.
Mr. Maloney said that presenting the Republican plan with the other options would send a message that the Republicans were serious about having their plan considered as a genuine bipartisan proposal.
Republican leaders have already said that their plan will contain no income tax and will feature some constitutional or statutory cap on state spending. But the ranking minority Senator on the committee, William H. Nickerson, a Republican from Greenwich, said last week that his party's plan would be revealed when it was ready and not before. He said the details would not be completed until at least April, long after the period for public comment has ended.
Mr. Nickerson said the Democrats were simply trying, as usual, to tell the Republicans what to do.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property: Suburban Office Development;
Overbuilding Leaves Huge Legacy of Empty Space

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
VACANCY rates of 25 percent or more are being recorded in many smaller office markets around New York City, where the accelerated pace of development during the 1980's is having much the same debilitating effect as in Manhattan.
For example, the latest report by the Cushman & Wakefield brokerage shows no office buildings under construction in any of the major Fairfield County markets. 
 "That has never happened before," said Michael H. Siegel, executive managing director of the northeast region for Cushman & Wakefield. "That, in itself, is probably one of the most striking items of what is actually going on in the market. I think every developer is faced with very difficult times."
In some measure, as in New York City, the troubles have been self-inflicted.
"Three or four years ago, a bunch of people thought Shelton was going to be the next hot spot in Fairfield County and stuck up a lot of buildings," said Richard Gretsch Jr., senior vice president of the Albert B. Ashforth commercial brokerage, whose office is in Stamford, Conn. "As a consequence, the vacancy rate has been well above 25 percent.
"I guess it was people's feeling that if you put up buildings, it would change the demand. It doesn't work that way."
"Office space was doubled in New Haven in the 1980's, hence the indigestion now," said Larry Hall, of Cavanagh, Fritz & Company, leasing agents for the new 27-story Connecticut Financial Center in New Haven.
From New Jersey came much the same story. "The excess has been built within the last 24 months," said Robert J. Rudin, executive director of the Edward S. Gordon Company of New Jersey, based in Saddle Brook, "and, if you look at the New Jersey market as a whole, more than 50 percent of the space has been built in the last 10 years.
"That says that we really built our oversupply, that the economic malaise has not caused the problem. What caused the problem was that we thought the region was going to expand at the same rate forever. It was that premise that led to overbuilding."
Year-end figures compiled by Cushman & Wakefield show vacancy rates as high as 35.8 percent in New Haven's central business district, 29.9 percent along New Jersey's Hudson River waterfront (Jersey City, Hoboken and Weehawken), 25.4 percent in eastern Fairfield County (Bridgeport, Shelton, Stratford and Trumbull) and 25.3 percent in both central Nassau County (Mitchel Field, Garden City, Mineola, Westbury) and in Morris County (including Parsippany).
Using different methods, the Gordon Company found a vacancy rate greater than 30 percent on the New Jersey waterfront.
These stood well above Manhattan at year's end, where the rates were 17.2 percent in midtown, 16.1 percent downtown.
Vacancy numbers can be misleading in smaller markets, which may be dramatically affected by one or two projects.
About vacancies on the waterfront, Donald Eisen, the branch manager of Cushman & Wakefield's New Jersey offices, noted "two very large buildings coming onto the market at once" -- 101 Hudson Street and the Newport Office Tower, both in Jersey City.
As another example, downtown New Haven has 1.9 million square feet of primary office space, contrasted with 169.6 million square feet in mid-Manhattan.
Much of its high vacancy rate can be ascribed to the 500,000-square-foot Connecticut Financial Center on Church Street, developed by Chase Enterprises of Hartford.
Cushman & Wakefield noted that a pending lease with United Illuminating for 200,000 square feet should bring the whole city's rate "down to a more reasonable level."
"Although it is a soft market -- no question about it -- it is not nearly as bleak as the Cushman & Wakefield numbers would indicate," Mr. Hall, the leasing agent, said.
About the United Illuminating deal, he said, "We're within weeks of a final lease signing, so that's virtually a done deal." He said 60 percent of the building was leased or, as in the case of the utility, "committed."
The Rostenberg-Doern Company, a real-estate concern that operates in Westchester and Fairfield Counties, uses different standards for the office buildings it surveys and draws different boundaries for the areas it describes. The rates it compiled are uniformly higher than Cushman & Wakefield's, ranging from 13.7 percent for southern Westchester to 37.5 percent for eastern Fairfield.
"On the good side," said John H. Rostenberg, "our absorption figures have gone to 1.5 million square feet for the Westchester-Fairfield region. The area from Tarrytown along I-287 to Rye, and the area from Greenwich to Norwalk have been very active during 1990 and continue to be the location of choice."
PERHAPS the most dramatic contrast in adjacent markets is between central Nassau County, with 25.3 percent, and eastern Nassau, with 9.2 percent.
"Eastern Nassau -- Woodbury, Plainview -- is a more stable market," said Joseph A. Lagano, managing director of Cushman & Wakefield and branch manager of its Long Island office. "It's a desirable area that's centrally located, with great access to parkways, it has larger-sized tenants and there hasn't been any major new construction to speak of. There was not a lot of land available for new construction."
In contrast, he said, central Nassau has seen the addition of the 240,000-square-foot Garden City Center and the 550,000-square-foot Nassau West Omni at Mitchel Field, which inflated the vacancy rate.
That is also the case in eastern Fairfield County, where there was a "tremendous upsurge in new construction," Mr. Siegel said.
"WHEN Stamford and Greenwich were tight in terms of new space and it was going in the strong mid-$30's," he said, "you might find competing space further east in the mid-$20's."
One of the big projects contributing to the high overall vacancy rates is a new 160,000-square-foot building at the Merritt Eight Corporate Park, at the junction of the Merritt Parkway and Route 8, developed by Hillman Properties of Pittsburgh.
It is now only 55 percent leased but John Markey, the vice president of development for Hillman Properties, said, "We're finding that the market has improved significantly in the last six weeks."
Mr. Gretsch, the broker, took the long view. "I've been doing this for 18 years," he said, "and I've seen five cycles. This one hurt people a little more because there were eight years of up. And they forgot."

HEADLINE: State Feels New Strains as Population Shifts

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO

 BODY:
AS the state's population shifts from the densely packed cities of the northeast to the rolling rural landscapes of central and southern New Jersey, political scientists say the trend toward suburbanization is creating a new set of challenges for residents, employers and many state and local officials.
 With companies continuing their gradual relocation from urban business districts to sprawling suburban office parks, experts say, residents left behind in the inner cities are finding it more and more difficult to get jobs, particularly ones accessible by public transportation. 
 State officials are now at work on a long-range plan for coping with the new population patterns. But some rural communities are already experiencing growing pains, as new residents strain the capacity of municipal services and public school systems. And for those who have fled the crowded cities for the quiet of the countryside, an unwelcome surprise often awaits them: weekend traffic jams on rural roads never meant to accommodate carloads of shoppers heading toward suburban malls and highway shopping strips. "These are several of the new realities that we now have to face," said Dr. James W. Hughes, a professor at the Graduate School of Urban Planning and Policy at Rutgers-New Brunswick.
"The 1980's was the strongest decade of economic growth that the state has ever seen," Dr. Hughes said. "And during the 1980's New Jersey experienced the greatest wave of economic decentralization in its history."
Following the major highways that crisscross the the state, and responding to the lure of affordable land and lower property taxes, businesses that grew during the boom years of the last decade often directed that growth into less expensive rural environs, Dr. Hughes said.
Rather than take over a new floor in an office building in Newark, for instance, a company might instead erect a new building of its own on one of the "growth corridors" along Interstate 78 or Interstate 287. Any new jobs created by the expansion, Dr. Hughes said, could then be easily filled with skilled, educated suburbanites. As a result, he said, both businesses and residents benefited from increasing suburban sprawl.
And whether the jobs followed the people or the people followed the jobs, he said, the end result was inevitable: more traffic, more congestion, more pollution and less open space.
"We no longer have rush hours in New Jersey anymore," Dr. Hughes said. "We have rush mornings and rush evenings, punctuated by lunch-time congestions. We are probably never going back to a congestion-free environment."
Indeed, the results of the 1990 Census of Population and Housing indicate a clear shifting of the population from densely populated counties in northeastern New Jersey, like Bergen, Hudson and Essex, to central and southern counties, like Hunterdon, Somerset, Middlesex, Ocean and Atlantic. In fact, the total population of Bergen, Hudson and Essex Counties declined by nearly 100,000 residents over the last 10 years. At least half that number, a little more than 54,000, is accounted for by a 16.4 percent decline in Newark, the state's most populous city.
Most other large cities, like Jersey City, Paterson, Elizabeth and Camden, managed to post modest population gains of 2 or 3 percent. But far more remarkable, experts say, are the huge growth rates for some of the rural municipalities.
 Galloway Township in Atlantic County, for instance, almost doubled, growing to 23,330 in 1990 from 12,176 in 1980. Voorhees Township in Camden County also nearly doubled, with population figures almost identical to Galloway's. And Plainsboro Township in Middlesex County almost tripled its population, growing to 14,213 residents by 1990, from 5,605 in 1980.
But there is a price to be paid for such growth, Dr. Hughes said. "By decentralizing population, we have also decentralized congestion," he said. "What were once pristine county roads are now packed with cars full of shoppers."
While suburban sprawl is causing traffic problems in formerly rural communities, it is causing problems of a different sort in the cities it leaves behind.
"All kinds of jobs are disappearing from the cities," said Richard W. Roper, executive director of the Council on New Jersey Affairs at Princeton University. "White-collar jobs, blue-collar jobs, manufacturing jobs and secretarial jobs are all moving from the central cities to the outlying areas."
 
'Locked Out' of Newer Jobs
 As a result, Mr. Roper said, "it means that people who live in the cities will be locked out of many of the newer jobs that have been created over the past 10 years."
The reason, he said, is that such people have no way to get from their homes in the cities to the jobs in the suburbs.
"The public transportation that's available to them just doesn't go to the outlying areas," Mr. Roper said.
Rose Sheridan, a spokeswoman for N. J. Transit, the state's public transportation agency, agreed.
"There are two parts to the problem," Ms. Sheridan said. "One is getting people from the cities to the suburbs, and the other is getting people from the suburbs to the suburbs."
The impediment to solving either or both, she said, is the difficulty of providing public transportation to many different locations spread over a large area. Public transportation, she said, is most effective in taking people to central points: from the suburbs into the cities.
"We expect that New Jersey is going to have to look at nontraditional mass transit to provide service to the suburbs," she said.
 
Forming Car and Van Pools
 Examples of nontraditional mass transit can be found among the state's six "transportation management associations," which are not-for-profit corporations that provide computer-assisted car-pool and van-pool arrangements.
One such company, Morris County Rides Inc. in Parsippany, was founded in 1986 and now operates 163 vans. It has formed almost 600 car pools for people who must commute to areas not served by traditional mass transit.
Treva J. Jones, an administrative assistant and secretary for the accounting firm of Coopers & Lybrand, asked Morris County Rides for help in setting up a van pool when her employer relocated to an office park in Parsippany 18 months ago. Ms. Jones and 14 other so-called reverse commuters leave from Newark's Pennsylvania Station and from stops in Orange and East Orange for their 45-minute ride to work.
Without the pool, Ms. Jones said, some members might find it difficult, if not impossible, to get to their jobs. "That's exactly why we started the service," she said. "There is no other means of public transportation."
 
Feeling Effects of Growth
 The only other alternative, it seems, and one that has been chosen by tens of thousands of New Jersey residents over the last decade, is to move away from the cities and closer to the jobs. But this solution has created some strain on the municipalities into which they are moving.
Evesham Township in Burlington County, for example, has grown to 35,309 residents in 1990 from 21,508 in 1980, an increase of 64.2 percent.
"We're in the Route 73 growth corridor, which is probably the second most active growth corridor in the state," said Burton T. Conway, the Township Manager. "We were putting up about 1,200 new housing units a year. But we've been doing quite a bit in the last five years to stem the tide."
Mr. Conway said township officials were now involved in a "growth control program."
"We passed a $10 million bond ordinance in 1987, and we've been buying open space away from developers," he said.
Mr. Conway said that since 1983, as a result of the increase in population, the township has had to add 10 police officers and increase the number of paid firefighters in its largely volunteer fire department to 14 from 2.
 
A Second School Rejected
 In addition, he said, the township had to build a new elementary school, and last year officials attempted, unsuccessfully, to get voter approval to build a second middle school.
 The municipal budget, he said, which was $5 million in 1983, has risen to $12 million in 1991.
"The tax rate is still relatively low because of all the new ratables," Mr. Conway said, referring to the thousands of new houses and condominiums built in Evesham Township over the last 10 years. Just about each new person who moves in, he said, essentially brings a new ratable to the tax rolls. But that, he said, is not going to last forever.
"This is the first year we haven't had an extremely high ratable growth, and we're beginning to see it in our tax situation already," Mr. Conway said.
"What happens when we're no longer adding ratables, but adding families?" he said. "Once the growth stops, how do we prevent ourselves from being another Camden 20 or 30 years from now?"
 
Drafting a Statewide Plan
 One way, said Martin Bierbaum, assistant director of the Office of State Planning, is to have a statewide development plan in place that encourages growth where there is an existing infrastructure, in cities like Camden and Newark, and to better manage whatever growth inevitably occurs in outlying areas.
To that end, Mr. Bierbaum said, his office is now in the process of drafting a comprehensive 20-year plan for future development in the state, as required by the State Planning Act of 1986. An interim report will be released in the late spring, he said. After hearings and the opportunity for written comment from the counties and municipalities, a final plan is expected to be issued a year from now.
The 1986 act established a 17-member commission to coordinate joint efforts by the state, county and municipal governments in developing a plan that "would see to it that we can provide housing at reasonable cost, protect the environment, retain farm land and rebuild the cities," Mr. Bierbaum said.
"The commission believes that growing in the ways we've grown have been too costly," he said. "In terms of job skills and employment opportunities, you've got the economy growing in one place and stagnating in another.
"And there's a real concern when a society builds a city and then 25 or 30 years later, it's abandoning that one to build one completely new. That just doesn't seem to make much sense."

HEADLINE: ABOUT NEW JERSEY

BYLINE: By Anthony DePalma

 BODY:
WELDED shut long ago, the door to apartment 8C in Building 5 at the Stella Wright housing project in Newark was now glowing red under the heat of an acetylene torch. A few feet away, Gregory P. Sanders waited, wondering what he would find when he and a crew of other housing-project tenants went inside to clean up and reclaim the abandoned apartment.
After a minute and a half, two minutes at the most, the welder, Morris Cirlincione, turned down the torch flame and, with his back to the door, gave it a loud, swift kick. "If there are any pigeons inside, the noise scares them out," Mr. Sanders said. "Otherwise, they come straight out at you." 
 For eight months now, Mr. Sanders, a crew chief, has been part of a team of public housing tenants working on a novel experiment that is being watched from all over the country. Venturing to mix economic advantage with the social-policy buzzword "empowerment," the Newark Tenants Council, which represents residents of public housing all over the city, has been given a yearlong $200,000 contract to clean up hundreds of vacant apartments in the projects so they can be rented again to Newark families.
The Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, which authorized the apartment-cleaning contract, considers it a model that can be replicated in housing-authority projects around the country. The department is eager for the project to succeed because it has the potential to accomplish so much: rehabilitating the projects and giving the tenants who live in them a stake in their future.
The project, if it works, also has the ability to give back to Mr. Sanders and other residents of the projects the future they thought they had lost.
It is fairly easy to lose the future in the dirt and despair at a housing- project apartment like 8C or any of the hundreds of others in Newark that Mr. Sanders has had to sweep since he began working with the tenants' organization last August.
"They were showing movies in here," he said, stepping over a heap of faded yellow newspapers in the entrance hall. On the floor in the front room of 8C was an old-time movie projector, leaning on three legs. A few feet away was a pornographic magazine. The air was stifling. Someone kicked an oversized plastic eight ball and sent it rolling across the floor.
"This one ain't too bad," said Mr. Sanders, the 24-year-old son of a retired Newark policeman. He wore a Cincinnati Reds baseball cap and, to protect his hands, short-fingered batting gloves. He checked the pigeon droppings on the bathroom sink and bathtub and judged the problem minimal, compared with the foot-deep layers he has found in some apartments.
The kitchen was a mess. Food moldered in the cabinets and a foul smell came from the refrigerator, which no one was willing to open. A burner on the gas stove was still flaming, and the box of baking soda and the dusty tablespoon on the wooden cutting board alongside gave proof that the last thing cooked there was cocaine.
Coke in the kitchen is just the kind of nightmare that makes Mr. Sanders dream so longingly of someday getting out of the projects where he has lived most of his life and moving with his wife, Annette, into their own house -- one with a backyard for their 4-year-old daughter, Nicole, and their baby son, Kahlil.
"That would be one of the greatest things," he said. "I grew up around drugs in the projects. I truly don't want my kids growing up in the same environment."
Mr. Sanders and his family live on the second floor of one of the brooding brick buildings at Hayes Homes, just a few blocks away from Stella Wright and apartment 8C. Until last year he had been doing all right, a high-school graduate working in construction for a small contractor. Then things got slow and the work dried up. He was putting in a few hours a week with the Newark Housing Authority's summer recreation program when he got a call last August saying he could earn $7 an hour with a new project to clean up empty apartments.
He went for an interview on a Monday and started working the next day. "I'm not going to say it's the greatest," he said. "But it's a job, and there are so many guys running around here that don't have jobs."
Although he has come across flocks of dead pigeons, cats wasted to skeletons, car parts, mouse-filled mattresses, a gun and many hypodermic needles, he says there is something about the work that makes it bearable, even worthwhile: knowing that the rooms that had been vacant so long, attracting squatters, addicts and all kinds of abuse, will finally be lived in again.
"You don't know whether the people who move in will be the nasty type person or the clean type," he said, "but I know that at least I've done my part to make things better."
There may be no place in New Jersey that needs improving more than Newark's high-rise housing projects. Three decades old, they had deteriorated so much that the housing authority planned to blow up most of them. Then, two years ago, local groups opposed to the plan won a court settlement to keep some projects, fix others and build new ones to replace every apartment that will be demolished.
So far, the Housing Authority says it has renovated and rented 1,658 apartments, a few more than the settlement called for. It has signed a contract to build 100 new town houses and is working on contracts for 365 more. All eight buildings -- 1,500 apartments -- in the Columbus Homes project in Newark's North Ward are vacant, and the demolition crews are to raze the complex by the end of this year.
Despite the work that has been done, there still are 2,421 abandoned apartments in Newark public high-rises, many of them fused shut long ago by Mr. Cirlincione's welding torch. And there are many people in the projects who, like Mr. Sanders, are waiting and hoping that someday they will be able to live without the smelly elevators and the fearful sounds that always seem to be bouncing off the tiled walls.
Carter Mangan, the supervisor of the tenants' cleanup crew, moved out back in 1975. He now lives in a single-family house in the Weequahic section, the part of Newark with grass and trees that looks a lot like Bergen County.
Mr. Mangan says he sees a younger version of himself in Mr. Sanders and the way he has taken on the responsibilities of crew chief. In this project of rebuilding buildings and restoring hope, such beliefs seem to make the strongest repairs.
"I had been talking about it a long time ago with Carter," Mr. Sanders said. "I wished that things could be better in the projects. They've gone down so bad. It makes you feel good to do this, you know, because it means that at least somebody cares. For a long time, I just thought nobody cared."

HEADLINE: County G.O.P. Sets the Tone Of Its '91 Campaign

BYLINE: By JAMES FERON

DATELINE: RYE BROOK

 BODY:
JACK KEMP, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, came to Westchester last week to help county Republican leaders open the 1991 political season. But from the opening moments of Tuesday's fund-raising dinner, it appeared he wasn't needed.
Anthony J. Colavita, the county Republican chairman, set the tone right away, predicting that "this is going to be a great Republican year," with President Bush "showing the world that he is a great leader with great courage and good judgment." 
 Then came the thrust, in the form of another prediction, this one addressed to Nita M. Lowey, the Westchester Democrat who unseated a Republican in 1988 and is now serving her second term in the House of Representatives. "We're going to remember how she voted on the Persian Gulf resolution," Mr. Colavita warned, to the first robust cheer of the evening. "There's going to be an accounting."
 
The Vote to Authorize War
 Mrs. Lowey was one of 179 Democratic Representatives who declined to authorize President Bush to go to war against Iraq in mid-January, preferring to give economic sanctions more time to succeed. A total of 86 Democrats joined 164 Republicans in the House in supporting the President's request to use force. The House vote to enter the war was 250 to 183. The measure passed 52 to 47 in the Senate.
Mr. Kemp, who called for a "new domestic order of freedom and opportunity and help for the helpless," paused near the end of his 20-minute address to make his own comment on those who opposed the Persian Gulf Resolution.
"I know we're not supposed to criticize Democrats for how they voted on the authorization to allow the President to fulfill the mandates given to him by the Security Council of the United Nations," he said, "so instead I will quote Sir Winston Churchill" on the beginnings of World War II.
Sir Winston spoke of "how easily the tragedy of the Second World War could have been prevented," Mr. Kemp said, "how the malice of the wicked was reinforced by the weakness of the virtuous."
 
Mrs. Lowey Responds
 Churchill, Mr. Kemp suggested, "wanted us to see how the councils of prudence and restraint had become the prime agents of mortal danger, how the middle course, adopted from a desire for safety and the quiet life, was bound to lead directly to disaster."
Mrs. Lowey, speaking later from Washington, said she felt that "those who politicize the issue and try to divide the people again are making a great error."
"The country is united and there is a marvelous feeling of confidence," she said.
Mr. Kemp "is very committed to the housing program of this country and is aggressively pursuing an agenda," Mrs. Lowey said. "I'd hope he and Mr. Bush would use that enormous popularity with the same intensity used in focusing on the war.
"The debate on the Persian Gulf resolution was a superb moment, and immediately afterward everyone rallied behind the President."
At the time of the vote, Democrats conceded that a negative vote would be characterized as an expression of appeasement if the war turned out to be short and with relatively few casualties. Republicans feared that a long and costly conflict, like the war in Vietnam, would leave them vulnerable to criticism for an affirmative vote.
Mr. Kemp spoke at the yearly Chairman's Dinner, a fund-raising event and pep rally at the Rye Town Hilton here that drew more than 800 Republicans at $250 each. The Secretary of Housing praised Westchester's leaders and specifically acknowledged the presence of a former Governor, Malcolm W. Wilson, saying, "Oh, that he were Governor today."
He repeatedly jabbed at Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, a Democrat, even in a brief chat with reporters who asked whether his department would have a continuing role in the Yonkers housing-desegregation case.
 
'A Viable Alternative'
 "Our party offers the best opportunity that people have had in a long time to have a viable alternative to the politics of envy, the politics of redistributing the wealth, and the politics of higher and higher, ever higher, taxes that has become the keynote of the Democratic Party," Mr. Kemp said.
Speaking of the decision to go to war with Iraq, he said: "When the Governor says he still can't figure out whether or not it was the right decision, you have to question whether or not the national Democratic Party is ready to lead the world into the next century.
"We can only achieve peace and freedom and democracy by keeping our country strong, making sure aggression is not rewarded. And while I never question anyone's conscience, I do question the judgment of those who say they're ready for world leadership but are to the left of the United Nations."
Progress in Yonkers
Addressing the Yonkers desegregation case, Mr. Kemp said that he was "not going to make any accusations" but that he hoped "this can be moved forward." He declined to be more specific. Work is proceeding on the first five of seven sites, where construction of 142 of a planned 200 units of subsidized housing is expected to begin in early April,
The Department of Housing and Urban Development is paying for the first 200 units as part of an agreement that removed H.U.D. from among the defendants in the 10-year-old housing desegregation case. Judge Leonard B. Sand ruled in 1985 in Federal District Court in Manhattan that Yonkers had intentionally segregated schools and housing over a period of four decades.
Yonkers education officials, ordered to find appropriate remedies, quickly introduced busing, created magnet schools to attract students across racially segregated neighborhood boundaries and took other steps that a court-appointed monitor said fulfilled the judge's requirements.
Integrating housing has been another matter. The Yonkers City Council refused to cooperate, so in 1986 Judge Sand proposed his own plan: 200 two-story, single-family town houses on seven sites "scattered" through the city's mostly white eastern and northern neighborhoods; and another 800 units of affordable housing to be built by private contractors, who would be granted incentives to include the apartments in market- rate developments that would have a total of 4,000 units.
 
'About As Far As We Can'
 But after five years, no developer for the 800 second-stage housing units has come forward. Mr. Kemp was asked last Tuesday if he saw a Federal role in breaking this impasse.
In reply, he recalled increasing H.U.D.'s financial contribution for the 200 units and then said, "I think we have gone about as far as we can or should go."
County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke, who accompanied Mr. Kemp, said he thought the soft housing market had made a complex situation even more complex.
Yonkers, meanwhile, is making another bid to delay the start of construction. The city is asking a Federal Appeals Court for extra time while it asks the United States Supreme Court to rule on an issue involving the manner in which DeLuxe Homes, the developer of the first 200 housing units, took control of the building sites last summer.
The city is seeking to challenge Judge Sand's the order transferring the sites to DeLuxe. City officials want a guarantee that Yonkers will regain control of the sites if they are not used for housing.

On Special Night, Men Get Lesson On Fear of Rape

DATELINE: DURHAM, N.C.

 BODY:
It is difficult to frighten most college-aged men, but a group of students at Duke University hope that bright orange stickers will startle men into realizing a fear that women find hard to forget.
Members of the Date Rape and Sexual Assault Task Force made men the targets Thursday night across the campus. Five couples roamed the Gothic quadrangles in search of their prey -- a man alone at night. 
 When an unsuspecting man walked by, the two people descended on him, one sticking on his chest an orange sticker about two inches across reading "Gotcha," the other handing him an informational pamphlet. "Gotcha," the couple said to the sometimes bewildered, occasionally offended man. The pairs confronted 290 men over four hours.
"This gives men a chance to see what women face every night they have to walk home alone," said Melissa Segal, a sophomore from Mechanicsburg, Pa., majoring in cultural anthropology and a member of the Duke Acquaintance Rape Education Program. The purpose of the operation was not to assault men but to raise men's awareness of the possibility of assault for women, Ms. Segal.
"It's actually a privilege to not have to worry about your safety," said Martha Simmons, director of the Women's Center and one of the operation's organizers. Several of the students involved in organizing the program belong to Men Acting for Change, a group dedicated to raising awareness of sexual violence among men.
"This is not women targeting men," said Philip Poley of Men Acting for Change, a senior political science major from Lexington, Ky. "This is men targeting men."
"Obviously there seems to be a problem with date rape around here," said Bradford Andrews, a junior economics major from Jacksonville, N.C., after he had been "gotten" by a prowling pair.
Recent occurrences on campus include a male student's assaulting a female student as she left the library one night, and a Durham resident's assaulting two women in their dormitory bathroom. Last year, a male student was charged with second-degree rape and eventually pleaded guilty to a lesser charge. The Undergraduate Judicial Board at Duke heard one sexual battery case last year involving two students.
"There are too many instances of it to ignore it," Mr. Andrews said.
 
Surprised by Sticker
 Few men were frightened by the sticker-wielding teams, but many said they were surprised or annoyed. Michael Fritz, a junior biology major from Solon, Ohio, said he had not been worried or frightened when a woman stuck her head through the door of the classroom he was studying in and asked him if he was alone. He was merely surprised when she stuck a sticker on him.
"I know there's no danger of my ever being raped," Mr. Fritz said. "I'm on the wrestling team and stuff, and I really don't have a whole lot of fear." He said this was the first time that he had been confronted with the issue of sexual assault and rape this sharply.
"What do you think a guy would do about it?" he asked. "There's always going be danger. There's always going be an isolated place."
The operation's organizers said they hoped that men would do something about the issue. The pamphlet advises men to generate discussion, show support for women and speak out against sexual violence.
"These men will be in public-policy decision-making positions just like women," Ms. Simmons said. "They'll make decisions that affect women's lives."

HEADLINE: About Cars;
Ownership, Through the Looking Glass

BYLINE: By Marshall Schuon

 BODY:
There is a delicious sense of voyeurism here. We are comfortable in the dark, a bunch of car writers and Ford executives, all of us fixated on the one-way mirror that allows us to watch and hear a dozen people talking about the pluses and minuses of their new cars.
This is a clinic, one of a multitude that Ford and the other manufacturers do whenever they introduce a new car. In this case, the car is the '91 Escort, Ford's $2 billion replacement for the compact that has been a leading seller ever since the original rolled out of its first showroom in September 1980. 
 The new Escort is built in America, but it is a hybrid, too, designed by Ford but engineered by the company's Japanese partner, Mazda. The engine in the lineup of hatchbacks and station wagons is Japanese, and the car is based on Mazda's 323.
The clinic is one of six being held across the country this week and next, and the idea is to find out what has been done right and what needs fixing. And some of what is left unsaid turns out to be as interesting as what is said. For instance, only one person mentions fuel economy, and engine performance is not mentioned at all. But we are getting ahead of ourselves here.
The clinic's captain is Martin Goldfarb, who likes to be called Marty. He is a sociologist who gave up teaching to start his Toronto company in 1966, and he now employs 100 researchers. The company has branches in New York, Detroit, Dallas and San Jose, Calif., and Marty has worked with Ford for 20 years.
"I approach this as an anthropologist," Marty has said. "It's interesting to study attitudes, to get people talking. And it's easy to get them to come in. They like to think they have some impact, that they can change the direction of their vehicle."
Respondents are paid $35 to $50, depending on the city, and the Escort owners have been randomly selected from a list of buyers who have had their cars from three to six months. None have been prescreened, and they know only that they will be asked about the cars, that somebody is watching, and that a video camera is running.
Marty is on the other side of the glass, his back and his bald spot to us. The six men and six women are ranged around the gray table. There are sandwiches and fruit, and Marty works to get them relaxed before plunging into the questions.
Then he starts with Robert Velasco, the man on his right. Tell us about your car, he says.
Velasco says he bought his Escort in October, his first new car. What he particularly liked, he says, was that it was American but with Japanese engineering. "I wanted to buy American," he says, "but the car had to more than just domestic. I'm patriotic, but I'm not that patriotic."
His problems, he says, have had to do with two blowouts, one when he ran over a broken bottle, another when the car hit a curb after avoiding an accident. But he is still happy.
Next comes Bill Carpenter, who also is happy, a lot happier, he says, than he was with his old 1986 Escort. He likes the styling and the steering. Charles Martucci complains that the rear windows of his two-door hatchback leak, but he says the car is good in traffic, and he particularly likes the wiper delay and the car's split rear seat.
Like Velasco, Susan Mushalla says she wanted an American-built car, and she agrees with Martucci that one of the nicer features is the back seat, whose cushions can be folded down individually to provide for a passenger and for cargo.
One of the women says she doesn't like the way her Escort handles, and she blames it on the tires. That surprises the rest, who say they have no complaint. Athena Stathes says her car has a leak in the trunk, and another woman complains that opening the hatchback in the rain allows water to run in on the rear radio speakers. There ought to be some sort of redesign, she says.
Marty writes that down, as he does with other suggestions.
The group agrees that the yellow handle of the oil dipstick is all but impossible to get at, and one of the men suggests that the dipstick hole in the engine block also be painted yellow to make it easier to find.
There are complaints about a lack of lighting in some areas, such as the glovebox. Several in the group complain about bad paint, about runs and smears. And Derek Witcraft, who bought an Escort after his Lincoln went the way of thieves, says he wishes mightily for antilock brakes, a safety feature not available on the Escort.
"I only had that Lincoln for nine months before it was stolen," he says. "But I know those ABS brakes saved me from accidents again and again."
The Escort also has no air bag, and that prompts agreement that the car's mechanized seatbelts take some getting used to. "At one point," says one of the women, "I leaned out of the car to look at something, and that belt wrapped itself around my neck and almost strangled me."
In the group discussion, the Escort's cupholders seem to be a winning feature. The remote releases for the hatchback and gas filler flap are well liked, and the car's maneuverability, front-wheel-drive traction and good ride all get high marks. In fact, the 12 owners agree that they love their Escorts, and they talk about the ways in which they have sold friends on the car. One figures he should get a salesman's commission.
The dealer experience seems positive, although one man says he would never go back to "that place." Another says he bought the Escort after shopping for a Honda and being told he had to put down a deposit before the salesman would even discuss price. "Do you believe that?" he says, and heads start to shake.
A simple thing comes up: Patricia's car was delivered with a full tank of gas, and that pleased her a lot. Some in the group say their cars were delivered with less, and Marty makes notes.
Then he asks about advertising, and surprisingly the group is unanimous in its complaint: There are too few commercials for Escort, and the ads don't show enough of the car.
Why, he is asked later, would people who already own the car want to watch the ads?
"Oh, that's easy," Marty says. "They want to validate their purchase. They want to keep proving that they made the right decision. I think it shows that the car is better than its advertising."

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Attacking a Scourge of Civilization

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
Britain is in a recession, and its voters are furious over taxes. So it is time for tax reform, British style, with higher sales taxes on consumers and lower levies on business profits. That was said to be politically popular, which shows that Britain is far from America in more ways than one.
Judging by the reaction of the British press, one of the more popular elements of the tax package was a provision that Norman Lamont, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, said would promote quieter restaurants and safer highways. 
 Mr. Lamont's way of so improving the environment was to propose a tax on what he called in his speech to the Commons "one of the greatest scourges of modern life: the mobile telephone." It turns out that posh London restaurants already have banned what The Times of London called "the infuriating warbling trill" that has "come to mar many a relaxed lunch."
Mr. Lamont's budget, which in the British system is sure to be enacted, calls for a revenue-neutral tax policy, in which the hated "poll tax," a charge levied on every resident of each community, is reduced and the money recovered through higher sales taxes. The value added tax, as sales taxes are known there, rises on April Fools' Day to 17.5 percent, from 15 percent.
The immediate result is likely to be a buying frenzy this week to beat the tax, but longer term that seems like a great way to depress consumer demand. All in all, a curious way to end a recession that appears to be worse than America's current one. Just as on this side of the Atlantic, the intent seems to be to fight recession with monetary policy, but British stocks slumped Friday when the Government cut interest rates by less than traders had expected.
The world economic outlook seemed more important last week, after I.B.M. stunned Wall Street by saying that weak European demand was a major reason this quarter would be a big disappointment. Suddenly, there was fear that the American recovery that the stock market has been forecasting might not be enough. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 89.36 points, or 3 percent, to 2,858.91, for its worst week in five months. Smaller stocks, which generally have less international exposure, barely wavered. The Russell 2,000 slipped just 0.56 points, to 165.80.
Some, such as Pat deBlank Klink, the president of Discount Advisers, a New York bond manager, think that slowing exports will encourage the Fed to ease even more, joining European central banks. France and Britain cut rates last week, Spain the week before, and it is widely expected that Italy will join the trend this week.
Unfortunately, in Germany the preoccupation of the central bank now is to defend the mark while blasting the Government for its ill-advised decision to allow monetary union with the former East Germany on terms that made eastern products totally uncompetitive. In both London and New York, markets probably would be thrilled if the Bundesbank decided to fall in step and lower interest rates. There are no signs, however, that will happen soon.

HEADLINE: World Markets;
The Geography of Diversification

BYLINE: By Jonathan Fuerbringer

 BODY:
With the end of the war in the Persian Gulf, Wall Street surged and stock markets around the world soared with it, highlighting once again the leadership role the American market can have.
But this is less the rule than one might think. In fact, outside of the big moves -- precipitated by events like the invasion of Kuwait last August and the stock market crash of 1987 -- many foreign stock markets follow their own tune. 
 This often weak correlation between American and foreign markets is one of the main arguments for diversifying a portfolio along geographic lines. If markets outside the United States generally are not led by the nose by Wall Street, then there is less risk of overall loss if stock and bond investments are made in one or more foreign countries.
"If you were of the view that the United States market was going to perform relatively poorly over a period of time, what you would do is ask yourself is there another market that is very poorly correlated with the United States," said Thomas R. Robinson, chief international equity strategist at Merrill Lynch in New York. "That way, you would have a better performance."
A new study by the consulting firm of Ennis, Knupp & Associates of Chicago says one reason for the noncorrelation of stock market moves is that many of the world's exchanges are far less diverse than Wall Street.
Using data from Morgan Stanley Capital International, the Ennis study rates major markets by their correlation with the United States. From 1970 through 1989, the stock market in Canada was the most closely correlated to Wall Street, in dollar terms, with a rating of 0.82. A rating of 1 would be a perfect correlation.
The lowest correlation was for Hong Kong, with 0.10, followed by Austria (0.22), Spain (0.25), Italy (0.32), Norway (0.33), Denmark (0.34), Germany (0.44), France (0.45), Japan (0.46), Belgium (0.48), Singapore/Malaysia (0.49), Sweden (0.52), Switzerland (0.58), Australia (0.58), Britain (0.59) and the Netherlands (0.67).
Not surprisingly, the degree of correlation of a particular market during this period was subject to change, sometimes dramatically so. Spain, for example, fell to a 0.03 correlation from 1980 through 1984 and then rose to 0.40 from 1985 through 1989. France's market also had such a wide swing, falling to 0.12 from 1980 through 1984 and rising to 0.63 from 1985 through 1989. But from 1980 through 1989, France's rating was 0.41, in line with its longer-range performance.
The Ennis report concludes that there is no significant evidence showing that the overall correlation level is rising over the long term.
A look at Japan shows how the general lack of correlation can change in the face of major events. But the Japanese experience also shows that, apart from such events, a foreign market's linkage to Wall Street can be even more tenuous than the overall numbers would seem to indicate.
From 1980 through 1989, the correlation rating for Japan is 0.42. But when the period is changed slightly -- to cover the years from 1981 through 1990 -- the correlation rises to 0.48. Part of this jump is attributed to the similar sharp declines that both the Tokyo and the New York markets took in the third quarter of last year after the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq.
"The correlation numbers are colored by the big extreme moves in markets," said Paul Burik, director of international research at Ennis, Knupp, which advises institutional investors, including pension funds and charities.
To make the point, Mr. Burik recalculated the 1981 through 1990 figures without the quarters in which the Japanese stock market had its biggest declines: the fourth quarter of 1987, after the Wall Street crash; the first quarter of 1990, when the Tokyo market fell much further than any other market, and the third quarter of 1990, when Kuwait was invaded. Without these moves, the correlation falls to 0.39, showing that in more normal periods, the correlation is weaker.
What this shows, Mr. Burik said, is "that you do not look to diversification of your portfolio as a protection from a global stock market decline."
Both Mr. Burik and Mr. Robinson of Merrill Lynch said that such coordinated market moves were to be expected in the case of the invasion of Kuwait, given that rising oil prices caused by the takeover were guaranteed to have a major negative impact on economies around the world.
But except for the fallout caused by world-shaking events, the diversification strategy can pay off with benefits that are quite attractive.
And now could be just such a time to benefit, according to Mr. Robinson. With the war in the gulf behind it, Wall Street is losing some of its leadership force, he says.
That means global market activity should move back toward its more normal -- and lower -- correlation levels. This is reflected in the fact that since Wall Street hit its recent peak March 6, the Dow Jones industrial average is down 3.85 percent, while Tokyo's Nikkei 225 is virtually unchanged, off by just 0.26 percent.

THE ECONOMY

 
Watch Out Taxpayers, Here Come the Banks
 

When lawmakers see a familiar balding man approaching from the direction of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's headquarters, they should declare a national day of mourning. The doleful news Thursday from L. William Seidman, the F.D.I.C.'s chairman, was that the fund to insure bank deposits needed authority to borrow another $70 billion. Lawmakers, fresh from providing $30 billion more to salvage the savings and loans, fear the worst. As Charles A. Bowsher, the Comptroller General, said, "I've been through taxpayer bailouts before and this is how they often get started." Mr. Seidman said that the fund can stay solvent by treating one loan, a $5 billion Treasury Department line of credit, as collateral for another, $45 billion loan, and raising the premiums charged on bank deposits . Maybe so. But the F.D.I.C.'s financing now seems as tottery as all the grandiose construction projects, leveraged buyouts and third-world investments that so many imperiled banks have financed.
 
Inflation on Top of Recession
 
To judge from last week's inflation report, this recession has none of the pleasure, all of the pain. Consumer prices rose two-tenths of 1 percent in February, but seven-tenths of 1 percent excluding the volatile costs of food and energy. Slower business usually means slower inflation as well. But prices have risen just as much in the six months since August, about when the recession began, as in the six months before. Some economists say that slack commodity and labor costs and unused capacity at factories will keep inflation in check. As Samuel D. Kahan, chief economist at Fuji Securities Inc., asked, "Because you had a snowstorm in New York a couple weeks ago, does that mean winter is going to be here with us for two or three months?" But after the inflation report blew stock and bond prices down, investors started shivering.
 
The Incredible Trump Divide
 
Memo to Ivana: Why not limit your exposure to your ex-husband's credit woes before the news from the Trump Tower triplex gets any worse? It's time for the world's first securitized divorce deal. Just sell off the rights to last week's settlement -- the $14 million up front, the $650,000 in annual child support -- and take the cash. The new-products boys on Wall Street could come up with a name that yields a jazzy acronym. (How about Special Priority Limited Ivana Transfers?). True, the securities will sell for a good deal less than your settlement's par value. But better to take a haircut than a scalping.
 
Procter & Gamble Fights Back
 
Some competitors implied that the Procter & Gamble Company needed to call in the exorcists, maybe to wave a cross and mumble some incantations over a box of Pampers. Instead, Procter called in the lawyers. Last Tuesday, a Federal judge in Topeka, Kan., awarded the company $75,000 from two distributors of rival Amway household cleansers and detergents. James H. Newton and his wife, Linda, had handed out leaflets urging a boycott of Procter, citing the company's old moon-and-stars trademark as evidence of Satanic sway.
 
Continued Strength in Exports
 
Exports continue as one of the few sources of economic growth, rising 3.6 percent in January to $34.5 billion. Higher imports widened the trade deficit slightly, to $7 billion. Neal M. Soss, chief economist at First Boston, said that even if the dollar remains stronger, exports are unlikely to suffer for a year or more. "People have a tendency to do business with established suppliers," he said, rather than switching at the drop of a pfennig or yen.
 
Women and the Workplace
 
The Supreme Court ruled that employers may not bar women from jobs that might endanger fetuses. Several companies now have to decide whether to reduce the use of hazardous chemicals, increase workplace protections or risk lawsuits.
 
 
 
COMPANIES

 
I.B.M. Takes the Market Down
 
Last week, I.B.M.'s outlook became a leading economic indicator unto itself. An announcement on Tuesday by the International Business Machine Corporation's chairman, John F. Akers, that first-quarter profits would be half those of the same quarter last year touched off a $12.75-a-share plunge in the stock -- a $7.3 billion one-day loss in the company's market value. Many investors, saying they took I.B.M.'s plight as evidence of a slow economy and weak earnings potential at other companies, sold other stocks, contributing to a 62-point drop in the Dow on Tuesday. After a year when I.B.M. resisted the gathering forces of recession, some analysts are inclined to apply the company's forecast of tough times ahead to the entire computer industry. "Comparing I.B.M. to other players in this tournament, it is reasonably well positioned," said Daniel Mandresh, who follows the company for Merrill Lynch. "The issue is the terrain. It's shaping up as a tough golf course."
 
Yet More Michael Jackson?
 
Sony is betting that the world can take another $1 billion worth of Michael Jackson. A deal announced last week gives Mr. Jackson at least $108 million for issuing six more albums on Epic Records, a Sony Corporation subsidiary. Then there are plans for full-length Michael Jackson feature films, Michael Jackson theatrical shorts, Michael Jackson television programs and a Michael Jackson record label. Sony executives, after some hurried calculations, said the whole package could bring in perhaps $1 billion in revenues. But Mr. Jackson might already have moonwalked out of the spotlight. Michael Jackson shoes, Michael Jackson toys and a Michael Jackson movie have all flopped.
 
First MCI, Now GTE
 
John D. Goeken has succeeded in another guerrilla assault on the telecommunications industry. Last Wednesday, the GTE Corporation announced an agreement to pay him and other investors $15.5 million to settle a suit over GTE's 1986 acquisition and subsequent management of Airfone -- the airborne phone service that Mr. Goeken founded in 1976, based on technology that he invented. GTE also agreed to drop its suit accusing Mr. Goeken of violating an agreement not to compete with Airfone. He founded a rival company, In-Flight Phone, in 1989, despite GTE's insistence that competition was technically unfeasible. GTE should have known how things would end up: Mr. Goeken also founded Microwave Communications Inc., later MCI, whose court actions helped break up the Bell System's monopoly.
 
Continental Outlook: 50-50
 
Can an airline that lost $2.25 billion in the fourth quarter be ready for takeoff? Executives at Continental Airlines Holdings Inc. explain the loss, the industry's record worst for a quarter, as a "balance-sheet cleanup." Like many a new chairman, Hollis L. Harris is willing to take write-offs and confess to the sins of his predecessor, in this case Frank Lorenzo. But the company's operating loss hit $333 million, and net worth is a negative $3.4 billion. Analysts say Continental's chances of emerging from bankruptcy reorganization are little better than 50-50.
 
The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation could lose hundreds of millions of dollars if airlines like Continental fail to recover, the agency's executive director said on Friday. Eastern, Pan Am and Continental, all in bankruptcy proceedings, have unfunded pension liabilities of $1.6 billion, with about $1.3 billion covered by the agency.
 
 
 
INTERNATIONAL

 
The Great Mexican Cleanup
 
First he had to begin cleaning up the oil monopoly's unions, then take care of its foulest oil refinery. Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari ordered the closing on Monday of Mexico City's largest refinery, one of the worst causes of the city's notorious air pollution. The region's exploding population and pell-mell industrialization have left it with air that stings the eyes, burns the throat and leaves many children with permanently impaired breathing. Restricting motorists to alternate driving days has made little apparent difference. Robert A. Pastor, director of the Latin American program at the Carter Center in Atlanta, said that the arrest of the Pemex oil company's powerful union boss in a 1989 shoot-out helped make last week's action possible.
 
Little for Gorbachev in Tokyo
 
The Japan that can say no to the United States is unlikely to say yes to the Soviet Union. Soviets and Japanese both are coming to doubt that a visit by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to Japan next month will produce any breakthroughs. The Soviet seizure of several islands from Japan at the end of World War II has stood in the way of so much as a peace treaty to officially end their hostilities. Henry Trofimenko, chief analyst at Moscow's Institute of U.S. and Canada Studies, said that Soviet conservatives bemoaning the loss of Eastern Europe can keep Mr. Gorbachev from returning the islands even if he wants to. Professor Trofimenko, visiting at Columbia University's Harriman Institute, recalls the time years ago when Andrei Gromyko, then Foreign Minister, asked to collect the party cards of any aides who even wanted to discuss the issue. Some Soviets hope that to recover the islands, the Japanese would grant the Soviet Union massive aid, including help in developing Siberian resources. But the Japanese are losing their enthusiasm for investing in a nation where business becomes more difficult each day.

Optical Fiber (Almost) at Home

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
Despite years of research and development, telephone equipment suppliers have not yet come up with optical fiber systems that are cheap enough to persuade local phone companies -- or the public utility commissions that regulate them -- to abandon copper wire completely. But they are getting close.
The hair-thin glass fibers have already replaced virtually all the bulky copper cable used in long-distance connections. They also carry more than two-thirds of the traffic from the central offices of local networks to the long-distance lines and between central offices, and that share is growing steadily. Now, fiber technology is pushing its way into the "local loop," as telecommunications engineers call the lines that run from central offices to the curbside of business and residential users. 
 "We are right at the crossover point where fiber to the curb is more economical than copper," said Paul Polishuk, publisher of Fiber to the Home, an industry newsletter.
At stake is a domestic market for replacing copper worth $6 billion annually, according to the Raynet Corporation, a Menlo Park, Calif.-based supplier of telecommunications equipment. Another $9 billion is being spent overseas each year on replacing copper with fiber.
Fiber is making extensive inroads by replacing copper as the conduit to district offices, also known as remote terminals, which function as distribution points in the field serving anywhere from 50 to 1,000 lines. More important, telephone companies are poised to order systems that will take fiber to curbside boxes near the telephone users.
The curbside boxes, also known as pedestals or subscriber interface units are like miniature switching stations. They convert the optical signals into electric pulses that can be sent down the existing copper wire into the home and work in reverse, converting electrical pulses to light signals, when the homeowner is talking on the phone. Phone companies are now willing to install them because the units are economical when serving as few as four customers.
Fiber to the curb still leaves the industry short of its dream of a system composed entirely of fiber. That system could deliver hundreds of video channels and services for home computer users as well as regular telephone service on a single fiber. In addition, the phone companies believe that a fiber network reaching the home would be cheaper to run, more reliable and easier to service.
But going the last few feet to the house itself with fiber promises to be expensive. Each house would need a box of optical and electronic devices to translate the light signals into electric impulses that could register as voices on a phone, data in a computer, or images on a television screen. To pay for that investment, the phone companies say they need permission from regulators to sell consumers more than what is commonly known as POTS, for "plain old telephone service."
As things stand now, the courts, regulators, and Congress have all sided with the cable television companies, publishers and consumer groups that have lobbied furiously to keep the telephone companies from offering video or database services in those areas where they also have the local telephone monopoly. The phone companies' opponents argue that the monopoly phone business would provide revenues that would unfairly subsidize any other services the phone companies might offer.
Few experts doubt that fiber will eventually reach most if not all homes. Copper wire simply does not have the capacity to handle such emerging technologies as high-definition television and integrated transmission of voice, video and data signals on a single line into a home. But which enterprises or consortiums of enterprises will be first remains up in air.
Faced with this uncertainty, telecommunications equipment suppliers have fallen back on a two-pronged strategy: make fiber to the curb competitive with copper and try to design systems that can be easily upgraded in the future. "Our initial approach was to go all the way to box at the home, but it didn't make economic sense so we backed off a bit," said William McCullen, product planner for Fiber in the Loop Systems at the American Telephone and Telegraph Company in Andover, Mass.
A.T.& T.'s fiber-to-the-curb design is known as an active double star. The first star is the spread of fiber lines from the central office to the remote terminal. The remote terminal sorts out traffic from the central office and directs, over the second star, an array of fiber lines to from 16 to 24 curbside pedestals.
A.T.& T.'s system uses more fiber than some of its competitors and more electronics to route traffic at the remote terminals. But it can use the same inexpensive lasers that are widely used in compact disks and has lower power requirements, according to phone company engineers. A.T.& T. says the system will also be easy to upgrade to handle services like high definition television.
Raynet's system has two approaches that have attracted supporters in the industry. Its bus system is up to 30 percent less expensive than A.T.& T.'s, according to Jane Belcher, an analyst at Duff & Phelps in Chicago. The bus is a fiber highway running from a central office or one of a group of district offices served by a central office. The bus has a series of curbside pedestals on it, like interchanges on an interstate highway.
Raynet is also marketing a variant on its system that uses a device known as a splitter to allow it to create a branch network. If the signal splitter is inserted at the central distribution point, the effect is to create an array of fiber pathways. It can also be inserted along the bus, creating a system that is part-star, part-bus.
Splitters are passive devices like prisms. Each pathway leaving a splitter carries all of the information that arrived there in a weaker form. Thus, engineers say, systems with splitters need more powerful transmitters than A.T.& T.'s and more sensitive receivers to make sure that no information is lost.
One of Raynet's advantages is Rides, the software package it developed in conjunction with BellSouth, to integrate fiber in the loop into the rest of the phone network and manage its fiber system. One competitor, the DSC Communications Corporation of Petaluma, Calif., has signed up to use the software in its own system and several other competitors are weighing similar moves.
Raynet and A.T.& T's competitors range from giants like Alcatel of France and Fujitsu of Japan to mid-sized companies like ADC Telecommunications Inc. and DSC, and small ones like Broadband Technologies Inc. All of the systems also have to provide power for the electronics they use since, unlike copper wire, the fiber network cannot carry its own power supply.
One unknown is whether deployment of fiber to the curb may in some cases delay fiber to the home. Copper has much more capacity over short distances than when strung for miles as it sometimes is in phones systems. Daniel Boyce, staff manager for fiber to the curb implementation at Southern Bell, figures that a fiber-to-the-curb system that cut the average copper line in a phone system from two miles to 500 feet would have 100-fold jump in capacity. "That creates some good opportunities for high-speed services," he said, while stressing that such a system would still have a fraction of the potential of a pure fiber system.

HEADLINE: France Sees Integration as Answer to View of Immigrants as 'Taking Over'

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS

 BODY:
Sifting through his papers, Claude Desvaux counted 203 foreigners among the 280 students attending his public school in the crowded Belleville section of Paris. But the real number, he added with a resigned smile, is much higher.
"We have children born in France who remain culturally foreign because they speak Arabic or some other language at home," the school principal said. "We have kids from the French Antilles who are French citizens but they don't feel French." 
 Across France, foreigners represent around 9 percent of all students under the age of 16, but in districts with high concentrations of immigrants, they invariably account for more than 70 percent of pupils.
Throughout Western Europe, there is a perception that immigrants -- Arabs in France, Turks in Germany, Pakistanis in Britain and so on -- are "taking over" schools, housing complexes and neighborhoods. That in turn has led to the movement of European families and the entire process has become known as the ghetto phenomenon. That in turn has become a major factor contributing to rising opposition to new immigration.
 
Viewed With Hostility
 Whether in Birmingham, Frankfurt, Florence or Marseilles, third-world communities have become the target of simmering xenophobia and occasional racist violence, with some ultra-nationalist groups even trying to court popularity by demanding that poor foreigners be forcibly repatriated.
Yet, with immigration already strictly controlled in Western Europe, many experts are now arguing that the problem and the solution lie elsewhere. Today's immigrants are viewed with hostility, they say, because earlier waves of immigrants and their children were not properly integrated.
With many governments under strong pressure to do something about immigration, this view is also gaining favor in European capitals. A recent report by the European Community's executive commission said the focus should now switch to integration, while France's new Council on Integration has just published its first findings.
In many European cities, as in the United States, the ghetto phenomenon occurs almost naturally.
Immigrants are drawn to where their relatives or friends already live. And as they start crowding schools, apartment blocks and hostels, often changing the local scenery with their shops and places of worship, European families move away.
The result is evident in the patio below Mr. Desvaux's office at the College de Fontaine-au-Roi in Paris's 11th arrondissement. At different times of the day, teen-agers of 28 nationalities, five religions and all races take breaks there between classes, but hardly a white French child is to be seen. "The ghetto phenomenon is a permanent danger to us," Mr. Desvaux said.
Experts argue, though, that race is not the principal obstacle to integration. Asked in a recent French poll why cohabitation with immigrants was difficult, respondents overwhelmingly identified different customs and religion and, to a smaller extent, language, while skin color was barely mentioned.
Attitudes have also hardened as immigrants have gone from guest workers to permanent residents. For example, when France, Britain, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands were welcoming the cheap foreign labor of single men between the late 1950's and the early 1970's, they represented an economic solution.
But by the 1980's, many immigrants had brought their families, customs and religions and had formed highly visible communities in countries with little "melting pot" tradition. Western Europe's economies still need them but, often trapped in poverty, they are now considered a social problem.
"They continually run the risk of unemployment, of having to accept the worst housing and of facing disproportionate difficulties in schools," according to the European Commission's recent report on immigration and integration. "They run the risk of becoming marginalized and remaining marginalized."
The report stressed that the problem not only affected newly arrived immigrants and refugees. "Their children and grandchildren also comprise a social and economic underclass," it said, "and this will not change until integration policies become stronger and more imaginative."
In France, it was only last year after a wave of violent racist incidents and rising support for the extreme-rightist National Front that the socialist Government of President Francois Mitterrand concluded that there was no viable alternative to speeding integration.
As a first step, it appointed a high-level Council on Integration to analyze the crisis and recommend action. And last month, the council issued its first report, drawing a dark picture of an immigrant population that is largely cut off from French society in its schools, housing and employment.
 
'Equality of Rights and Duties'
 Dealing first with principles, it declared that France's concept of integration meant guaranteeing "equality of rights and duties" for everyone rather than reinforcing segregation of immigrants by treating them as special communities or minorities.
But it also recognized that, while earlier generations of immigrants and refugees from Eastern Europe had been naturally assimilated, "patient, vigorous and inventive" measures would be needed to integrate the Arabs, Africans and Asians now crowding schools, housing complexes and hostels.
The problems involved are apparent enough in Paris's 11th arrondissement, where parents can choose among five public schools. And that means, in Mr. Desvaux's words, "they can choose not to integrate." As a result, his school carries the main burden of handling local immigrant children
That in turn has predictable consequences. While 80 percent of pupils at a nearby lycee continue studying after the age of 16, only 40 percent of Mr. Desvaux's students do so. Similarly, nationwide, while 30 percent of immigrants between the ages of 16 and 24 are unemployed, the figure for French youths is 20 percent.
French schools in turn mirror the concentration of immigrant housing. About 120,000 immigrants live in some 400 "temporary" hostels owned and managed by the Government. But most other immigrants live in low-cost housing that quickly brings the ghetto phenomenon to districts and towns.
The French Government has established greater integration of the hostels and the low-cost housing blocks among its objectives, but the problems are myriad. In one well-run hostel in Evry, 30 miles outside Paris, the fact that most of its 271 guests are foreign permanent residents means there is little room for French workers.
A few hundred yards away, a low-cost housing complex crowded with Algerians, Moroccans, Tunisians and growing numbers of sub-Saharan Africans poses even greater obstacles to integration because, in Evry at least, it is already identified with uncollected garbage, violence and frequent police raids.
At the College de Fontaine-au-Rois in Belleville, Mr. Desvaux said he had no difficulty maintaining order inside the school. "But there is a problem of delinquency outside," he said. "The problem is that when the kids go home, there's no one there, so they hit the streets. Often the only social structure is a street gang."
But winding up a two-hour French lesson before a class of 15-year-olds, Claude Beaudoin insisted that the children of immigrants were gradually becoming integrated. "We get young Arab girls asking for our help to prevent them from being sent home to get married," the young teacher said.
In the class, impatient for lunch after studying a poem by Paul Verlaine, there were children from Sri Lanka, India, Cambodia, Mali, Yugoslavia, the French Antilles and all the countries of North Africa. But when asked who wanted to go home, only one boy from Guadeloupe raised his hand. "I miss the weather," he said.

HEADLINE: Real Estate and Tax Abuses

 BODY:
To the Editor:
With regard to Ronald G. Weiner's Forum article ("Blame the Recession on Tax Reform," March 10), while I have no quarrel with the general thrust of the article, I think Mr. Weiner is looking through the wrong end of the telescope when he blames the end of a tax abuse for real estate problems.
The very cause of the problem was the fact that investors flocked to real estate ventures of all stripes because of the artificial arrangements. Undoing those has caused and will continue to cause for some time a considerable degree of pain for those lured into such investments.
But Mr. Weiner blames the cure for being the disease. The fact is that the real disease has caused speculative overbuilding at every level and the real estate markets are coming apart from the oversupply (coupled with reduced purchasing power from a recessionary economy).
By Mr. Weiner's logic, the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and now the Resolution Trust Corporation should be held liable for the saving and loan and other banking industry problems!

A New Policy Fights the Risks Of Passive Smoke

DATELINE: MIDDLETOWN, Conn.

 BODY:
Because of rising concerns over the health risk that passive smoke poses for nonsmokers, Wesleyan University has begun a new smoking policy for faculty and staff members.
Beginning July 1, employees will not be allowed to smoke in university buildings except in private offices and designated areas. A similar policy for students is being developed by the Student Assembly. 
 David Landsberg, director of human resources, said the new policy was created after several nonsmoking faculty and staff members voiced concern over the dangers of passive smoke. "With more and more documentation of the damage of passive smoke, a number of employees feel they have the right to be protected," Mr. Landsberg said.
Most faculty members appear to support the new ban. "If somebody is in the hall, smoking, it really bothers me in my office," said Priscilla Meyer, a professor of Russian language and literature. "I think it is a good thing."
 
Policy Called Intrusive
 But some faculty members think the policy is unjust. Noting that he was "in the minority," David Titus, a professor of government, called the policy intrusive and an effort "to legislate morality."
"We have an ideology of nonsmoking," Professor Titus said, "but if I die of cancer or emphysema that's my business."
The issue has been more controversial among students. A smoking ban for students, proposed two weeks ago at a Student Assembly session, met with strong opposition. "It is unenforceable and alienates a large segment of the population," said Andrew Beckler, a senior majoring in social studies from Greenville, Del., and an assembly member.
The assembly passed a motion of "vague approval of a more restrictive smoking policy, particularly for student bases such as classrooms and the Campus Center," said the student assembly president, Louis Maggiotto, a junior from Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y., majoring in economics and film. The motion also called for the creation of a student committee to study the issue.
Charles Negaro, president of T.P.A. Books, which owns Atticus Books, the Wesleyan bookstore, and the Atticus College Store in the Davenport Campus Center, has joined in the anti-smoking effort.
Mr. Negaro, a former smoker, has suggested to the university administration that the Campus Center be declared a smoke-free building and has volunteered to stop selling cigarettes in the Atticus College Store.
"We would like to assist in the process of sensitizing students to the smoking issue," Mr. Negaro said.

HEADLINE: Seeking More Minority Council Members

BYLINE: By FRANK LYNN

 BODY:
A New York City commission is devising new district lines for an expanded City Council intended to accommodate more black and Hispanic members, and possibly Asian-Americans, homosexuals and other minority groups, including Republicans.
Politicians expect the new alignment to insure the election of minority representatives to at least 8 of 16 new seats when the Council expands to 51 members from 35. That would increase minority membership from the current 26 percent to at least 33 percent. 
 Blacks, Hispanic residents and other minorities account for almost 57 percent of the city population, according to the latest census figures.
 
New Power for Council
 The expansion of the Council to its largest membership in 54 years will complete a city government revolution under the new City Charter approved by voters in 1989, in which a more powerful Council has replaced the Board of Estimate as the city's chief legislative body.
By drawing districts that group, for example, large numbers of black or Hispanic residents, the Districting Commission can increase the likelihood that minority members will be elected to the Council from those districts. In the past, the opposite tactic was often used to dilute the voting strength of certain groups.
The drawing of the new lines, to be completed in early June, has touched off a scramble as incumbent Council members, members of minority groups and Democratic and Republican leaders seek to influence the 15-member commission and its 29-member staff.
Several politicians predicted that the districting would draw lawsuits like lightning from minority groups contending that they were not properly recognized. "Everyone is waiting for the mother of all lawsuits," said City Councilman Walter L. McCaffrey, Democrat of Queens.
 
'List of Endangered Species'
 There is already a lawsuit challenging the commission itself as a product of racial and ethnic quotas, but that suit is aimed at future commissions, not the present group. The Justice Department must also approve the new district lines under the Federal Voting Rights Act.
A Democratic Party leader, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the commission had "set itself up for failure by putting everybody but the Aleuts on their list of endangered species."
Despite those concerns, Frank J. Macchiarola, the commission chairman, expressed confidence that the commission would complete its work in time for the 51 members to be chosen for two-year terms in the September primary and the November general election this year. In the regular 1993 municipal election, the Council members would be up for election to their usual four-year terms.
Mr. Macchiarola said that he thought lawsuits challenging the new districts were likely but that he did not expect them to interfere with the election.
In an effort to defuse discrimination arguments, the commission and its staff have held 350 meetings with community boards and civic, religious and ethnic groups and 14 full-scale hearings, with at least that many more hearings scheduled over the next three months, said Alan Gartner, the commission's executive director, who is on leave as research director at the City University Graduate Center. Mr. Gartner pointed with pride to a city map covered with red and green pins denoting meetings and hearings.
He is a long-time associate of Mr. Macchiarola and Deputy Mayor Bill Lynch and was an unpaid issues adviser in the campaign of Mayor David N. Dinkins. The commission itself was appointed jointly by the Mayor and the City Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, often on the recommendation of political leaders.
Mr. Gartner said that so far Asian-Americans, Dominicans and gay groups had been the most vocal advocates of Council representation.
While they do not represent racial or ethnic minorities, the gay groups, as well as Republicans, base their arguments on the charter mandate to "keep intact neighborhoods and communities with established ties of common interest and association, whether historical, racial, economic, ethnic, religious or other."
Using the returns from three elections that included openly gay candidates, gay and lesbian groups have urged establishment of a West Village-Chelsea district that could elect one of their number. Mr. Gartner said such districts had been created in other cities.
Asian-Americans are promoting a district in the Chinatown area, and Dominicans are seeking a Washington Heights district.
New, predominantly Hispanic, districts are likely to be created in the South Bronx, East Harlem and in the Williamsburg and possibly Sunset Park sections of Brooklyn. Queens also has a large Hispanic population, but it is more diffused than those in other boroughs and therefore not likely to warrant a Council seat.
New black districts are likely to be created in Harlem, southeastern Queens, the South Bronx and the East Flatbush and Bedford-Stuyvesant sections of Brooklyn.
Republicans, who now have only one Council member, from Staten Island, could elect as many as five in the new districts, though some Democrats dispute that number. New Republican districts could include two in Queens, one on the East Side of Manhattan and a new Staten Island-Brooklyn district. The Staten Island Borough President, Guy V. Molinari, a rare Republican city official, said he and Rudolph W. Giuliani, the Republican candidate for mayor in 1989 and possibly again in 1993, would actively seek viable Republican Council candidates in the target districts.
Each district will have a population of about 143,580, 70,000 less than in the present districts.
Mr. Gartner and Mr. Macchiarola acknowledged that incumbent Council members and other politicians had made many suggestions in private and public meetings and would almost certainly have strong opinions when the first tentative district maps are released in early May. The final versions will be released on June 3 -- about two weeks before the election process starts with the circulation of nominating petitions.
 
Maneuvering by Incumbents
 Many incumbents hope to retain areas of strength and lose unfriendly areas in their districts. Assemblyman George Friedman, the Bronx Democratic leader, said one councilman "is trying to cut a district to exclude" a potential opponent.
Mr. Friedman tried his own selective districting with a bill, enacted last year, that would include Rikers Island and its 18,000 prisoners with the Bronx, as it has been historically. But the City Charter requires a bridge or ferry connection, which would make the island part of Queens. Mr. Friedman conceded that the Justice Department is likely to opt for Queens.
Having the prison in one's domain is considered advantageous because the prisoners add numbers to a borough and thus increase representation but usually do not vote, so they are not an electoral bloc.
Does all the maneuvering constitute new-fashioned gerrymandering? "No question about it," Mr. Friedman said.
Mr. Gartner of the commission called that description "a crude assessment, but not totally absurd."

HEADLINE: Democrats Assail Bush and Talk Tough About '92

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 23

 BODY:
The Democratic National Committee fortified itself today for the long march toward the 1992 Presidential election with fiery attacks on President Bush and tough talk about the fight it intends to wage next year.
What was missing was a candidate. 
 Party leaders, gathered here for the Democrats' first national committee meeting since the war in the Persian Gulf, tried to make a virtue out of necessity. They said that Presidential campaigns had grown too long in recent years, that the American people were not clamoring for the Democratic contest to begin and that the dearth of Democratic candidates did not reflect a moribund party.
 
'Plenty of Time' to Campaign
 "I'm glad there's been a delay," said Ronald H. Brown, the Democratic national chairman. "A Presidential campaign that starts this summer or this fall is plenty of time."
In the meantime, Mr. Brown and others tried to regain the offensive after weeks of watching Republicans glory in the success of the gulf war. "They make no bones about the fact that their vision extends no farther than November 1992," Mr. Brown told Democrats today. "Their domestic policies consist of no more than vetoes and pep rallies."
Senator John D. Rockefeller 4th, Democrat of West Virginia, asserted that it was time for Democrats to "take off the gloves" and engage the Republicans on major challenges like health care.
Senator Rockefeller, who told reporters that contrary to speculation he had ruled out a run for the Democratic Presidential nomination in 1992, asserted, "While health care may be a nonissue and a nonstarter on Pennsylvania Avenue, on Main Street and in cities, suburbs and rural towns across the country health care is the pocketbook issue."
But, while the Democrats tried to push a domestic agenda, concern over political fallout from the gulf war was a persistent undercurrent here.
Senator Rockefeller touched upon it with a dark joke. He said, "Reporters keep asking Ron when our party is going to field some Presidential candidates, when will some Democrats finally go to Iowa." The Senator said it was part of a master plan: "Democrats never got a chance to prove that sanctions could have worked in Iraq, so guess what? We're going to try them against Iowa."
Thomas S. Foley of Washington, the Speaker of the House, served warning to some of the party's own consultants who talk publicly about the Democrats' grim chances next year. "Those who sup at our table and sleep in our houses should be supporting us," Mr. Foley said. His warning, reminiscent of John L. Lewis's criticism of President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1938 ("It ill behooves one who has supped at labor's table . . ."), prompted a standing ovation from the audience.
 
War Opposition Played Down
 Mr. Foley also sought to play down the political impact of the Democrats' votes against a resolution in January authorizing the use of force in the gulf. A majority of Democrats in the House and the Senate voted against the resolution. Republicans have said they intend to make that a major issue in the 1992 elections, asserting that it shows that Democrats are inherently weak and incapable of conducting foreign policy.
The Speaker said the American people would reject such an appeal.
While most of the party leaders were trying to rally spirits, John R. Silber, who ran an insurgent and unsuccessful campaign for governor of Massachusetts last fall, came to the Democrats with some blunt warnings. "If the Democratic Party doesn't open its eyes and read the ticker tape they're not going anywhere," he said, urging that the party get back to basics with solid economic programs and a tough policy on national security.
"We've got to stop this nonsense of trying to create a class war," added Mr. Silber, who has also been the subject of some Presidential speculation. "I have no intention of running, but it's a contingent world."

HEADLINE: Not Euphoric but Perplexed, Nation Deals With the Peace

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS

 BODY:
When the war with Iraq ended on Feb. 28, Americans sighed with relief, and many smiled with pride. For a precious few days, the euphoria stilled domestic disputes and indulged a national daydream about solving economic and social woes with something akin to six weeks of surgical bombing. Then America woke up, and the recession was still playing on the clock radio.
In interviews last week, sociologists, economists and poll takers, not to mention plastic surgeons, letter carriers and surfboard salesmen, spoke of a perplexing period of rising and falling moods and expectations. 
 "What Americans are telling me," said Samuel W. Kaplan, a professor of sociology at Swarthmore College, "reminds me of what Rita Hayworth once said about herself: 'Men go to bed with Rita Hayworth and wake up and find it's only me.' America went to bed with a great victory and woke up with a victory that no longer seems so great and a world filled with problems that we basically aren't able to do anything about."
Even the sweet aftertaste of triumph was tainted by omens of civil war, disease and famine in Iraq. "There is still so much turmoil over there in the gulf," said Andrew K. Bassett, a letter carrier who paused in his rounds in downtown Philadelphia. "Who knows how it will end?"
Surveys suggest that while the war caused a lot of anxiety it never fully distracted people from problems at home. On the day the cease-fire was announced, only one number popped up like a champagne cork: Americans gave President Bush an 88 percent approval rating for the way he was handling his job, according to The New York Times/CBS News Poll. But even then, the respondents gave the President a 42 percent approval rating (and a 43 percent disapproval rating) on his handling of the economy, which they ranked as far and away the nation's biggest problem.
Nor did the afterglow of victory shine on Vice President Dan Quayle, whose approval rating rose just 3 points, to 19 percent from 16 percent two months earlier. (The nationwide telephone poll of 1,252 adults was conducted March 4-6 and had a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points.)
If these numbers could talk, though, some of them would certainly sound like Leopold J. Schlogel, a retired aircraft mechanic who lives in White Marsh, Md., a suburb of Baltimore. "I am a Democrat, but I think the war victory will help President Bush. He's going to try to straighten things out here at home, and I think he will do all right.
"Before the war," he continued, "we would say we're going to do this or do that, and we never did. Like in Vietnam, where we just gave up. This time, we did exactly what we said we were going to do, and that means a lot. People will look up to us and believe what we say, and I really do think the victory will help solve our problems over here too."
 
Winning, but So What?
 In a poll conducted in the last two weeks of the war, 677 residents of metropolitan Houston ranked their concern about war in general far behind their concerns about drugs, the environment and the economy. "What this poll says is, 'We're winning this war, but it is largely irrelevant to us,' " said Stephen L. Klineberg, a sociology professor at Rice University who directs the poll, the Annual Houston Area Survey.
America's anxiety level is also measured by how much people spend. Some bankers and economists predicted that the end of the war would reduce uncertainty, entice droves of consumers back to the marketplace and make the recession fade quickly. The Bush Administration encouraged such hopes by linking the start of the recession with the start of the gulf crisis in August, and just about every faltering business and ballet troupe blamed the war for some of its troubles.
But Herbert B. Ershkowitz, a history professor at Temple University, said World War II had imprinted on many Americans an erroneous notion that wars and economic recoveries are linked. The war with Iraq was largely fought with supplies from inventory, and it caused none of the disruptions that accompanied earlier wars in this century, like rationing and price controls. As World War II ended, Professor Ershkowitz said, millions of Americans had been unable to buy new houses or cars for 16 or 17 years; the Iraqi cease-fire came after a decade of prosperity and rising personal debt.
 
A Reservoir of Uncertainty
 Many economists say the war's end does reduce uncertainty and anxiety about the future, but not greatly. John Kenneth Galbraith, the Harvard economist, said, "There might be some people who, out of largely irrational concerns, postponed consumer durable purchases like houses and automobiles during the war, but their purchases won't have any significant effect on the economy."
And plenty of uncertainty remains. "I was in euphoria when we won the war, and I never use the word euphoria," said Fran Carpentier, an editor at Parade magazine in Manhattan. "I had the sense we were America the Unbeatable again.
"Then there was all this positive stuff about the war carrying over, and the Bush Administration predicting the economy would turn around and that consumers would not behave as dourly as they have. What's happening? I was just getting ready to tighten my belt! Now I am afraid to miss a day's newspaper for fear of missing an entire economic trend."
In a random survey of businesses in several cities, most managers said they had not seen any significant improvement since the end of the war. But there were some exceptions: Home sales in Houston surged after the cease-fire. Sears, Roebuck & Company is seeing more traffic in its stores. Travel to domestic and foreign destinations is picking up, spurred by bargains and giveaways.
Surfboard sales are up at Bruce Jones Surfboards in Los Angeles. Plastic surgery has picked up in Dr. J. Bradford Fisher's office in Fullerton, Calif. And in Manhattan, demand has "gone through the roof" the past two weeks for Elizabeth Arden's Miracle Morning, a $175 package of services that include a facial, makeup application, manicure and cucumber sandwich, said David Fairbrother, Arden's general manager.
Leigh Martin, the manager of Jones Surfboards, said: "People were dealing with the burden of not being sure how long the war was going to drag on, and now there's nothing to watch on CNN anymore, so they're starting to come out and buy things again."
 
People Still Have to Drive
 Automobile sales are way off, but Marion and Leo Brenner, a retired couple from Wilmington, Del., still were shopping for a car in the Winner Lincoln-Mercury dealership in southwest Philadelphia. "We just needed a new car, with or without the gulf war," Mrs. Brenner said.
But Howard Holniker, a Winner salesman, said a flood of customers came with war's end. "The two weeks after the war were our best in four or five months," he said. "Traffic through here tripled."
Other consumer experts say the consumer has not yet spoken. "There is no surprise that the very large positive reaction to the end of the war could not be sustained, but the real issue is how much of that gain in consumer confidence will be maintained," said Dr. Richard T. Curtin, who takes monthly samples of consumer attitudes at the Survey Research Center at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.
"I think I'm a typical consumer," said Richard Heslin, a professor of psychology with a specialty in consumer behavior at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Ind. "My two daughters got married this year, and I'm just starting to pull back from credit card disaster. I am determined to pay cash for my next car, and I may only have enough to buy a 4-year-old one.
"The country is feeling good about the war. I'm feeling good about it, but I still can't afford a new car."

HEADLINE: Cuts, but Also Promise, in Mental Health Spending

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS

 BODY:
Many states trying to close budget gaps this year are cutting expenditures for the most helpless and stigmatized populations -- the mentally ill and the retarded. But while the cuts are causing a great deal of anguish among patients and families, this seems to be one of the rare cases in which less spending holds the promise of more service later.
In many states the financial problems are accomplishing what state officials have not had the political muscle to do for many years: overcome opposition from unions and local officials to close underused state mental hospitals, clinics and schools. 
 State officials say that by closing such institutions they can save huge amounts of money and then serve many more patients through expansions of community-based services.
 
Opportunity to Improve
 "The fiscal problems provide an opportunity to improve programs, and most state agencies look at it that way," said Harry C. Schnibbe, executive director of the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors in Washington.
For years entrenched opposition has forced states to come up with the money to keep the old state institutions open even as thousands of patients were shifted to the care of smaller community-based centers. In many states the cost of operating the institutions limited the states' abilities to finance the community programs and forced many mentally ill people onto the streets or into jails.
But the financial crises many states are now facing have changed the climate.
An outstanding example is Michigan, whose budget gap has forced a 9 percent cut in nearly all departmental budgets. The Department of Mental Health was forced to cut $88 million out of its $915 million budget.
"The budget crunch provided the stimulus to close four state hospitals," said Thomas G. DeLoach, a department spokesman. Two were hospitals for mentally ill children. Together the two cost $12.5 million a year to operate, have 240 workers and serve fewer than 50 children.
"Without the extra push of economic reality it would have continued to be an enormous struggle to close these hospitals," Mr. DeLoach said. "Everybody had their parochial interest in maintaining the status quo and it seemed like at every step of the process, another group would oppose the closing.

 
Legislatures Take a Role
 In all, Michigan plans to lay off 1,200 mental health workers and transfer 400 patients to community residences and other state and community hospitals. More Draconian cuts were averted recently when the Legislature agreed to reconsider the department's budget, and the Legislature is now expected to restore about half of the initial cuts, or about $45 million.
New York, pressed by a $6 billion budget gap this year, has announced similar steps, including the closing of four of its 22 underused state hospitals. Like most other states, New York spends about 70 percent of its mental health budget on institutions even though 70 percent of the mentally ill are in the community.
"I would be crying like you wouldn't believe if we had to take these cuts without improving our outpatient services to the mentally ill homeless and without the expansion of 4,000 new community residence beds in the next two years," said Richard C. Surles, New York's Commissioner of the State Office of Mental Health. The state spends more per capita on mental health than any other state -- $140 a year compared to $37 by California, for example.
Mental health experts generally applaud efforts to focus mental health care in such centers, rather than in state hospitals, but some worry deeply about the immediate budget reductions and inevitable disruptions in care.
"It goes without saying that the cuts in mental health programs will be devastating," said Dr. Allan I. Leshner, acting director of the National Institute of Mental Health. He said public spending on mental health programs, totaling $20 billion a year, must be increased to make up for sharp limits placed by insurance companies on medical and disability benefits related to mental illness.
Laurie M. Flynn, executive director of the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill, an advocacy group, in Washington, said she hoped some good would come of the budget reductions, but she added, "Until we see the other shoe drop, I don't see this as a net gain for mental health services."
 
Some Cuts Difficult
 Rhode Island, for example, which has one of the nation's top ranked mental health systems, has only one state mental hospital still in operation, making it difficult for the state to make any large cuts in institutional spending. Donald P. Galamaga, executive director of the state's Mental Health Management Services, said the department has laid off 200 employees and put others on periodic one-day furloughs.
The state's budget gap also threatens next year's plan to open 30 group homes for the mentally retarded. That possibility upsets William and Ella Romer, who live in Warwick, R.I., with their severely retarded daughter, Caroline, 49 years old. The Romers say they have been trying to place her in a group home for many years. "We want to make sure that when we go, Caroline is taken care of," said Mrs. Romer. She is 76 years old and Mr. Romer is 81.
Massachusetts, with its now well-known budget woes, is going a step further than many other states. The state plans to transfer 400 to 500 patients from state hospitals to new beds in residential programs and to consolidate state hospitals and transfer some patients to private hospitals in the community. Keeping such patients in general hospitals is cheaper than keeping them in state hospitals because the Federal Government, under Medicaid, picks up half the bill.
Sweeping proposals by the states have generated a lot of debate in the mental health community, which is both fearful of change and desperate for it. "I'm optimistic, but it is too early to judge what will take place," said Dan E. Weisburd, president of the California chapter of the Alliance for the Mentally Ill, based in Los Angeles.
In Michigan the cutbacks in services at state institutions are being balanced somewhat by proposed increases in spending for community mental health programs. Gov. John Engler has proposed an increase of $41 million, or 12.7 percent, in the $366 million budget for such programs in the next fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1.
"Because we are strapped financially, we can no longer fund both an institutional approach and a community-based approach to mental health care," said Governor Engler, a Republican who took office in January with a pledge to reduce programs and taxes. "Funding two separate systems, to please the advocates of each, has not worked," he added.
Mental health professionals generally support the Governor's proposals, but for many families with immediate problems the promise of future changes has little meaning.
Denise Kusc said she is "horrified" by the planned closing next month of York Woods Center, one of two children's hospitals being closed, in Ypsilanti. Ms. Kusc, whose 14-year-old daughter, Rachel, is a patient at York Woods, joined other families, advocates and unions in a lawsuit to force the state to keep open all four of the hospitals in the closing plan.
In an affidavit that she filed with the Ingham County Circuit Court, a state trial court in Lansing, Ms. Kusc said that Rachel had been severely ill for several years. "There was one afternoon when she harmed herself terribly by mutilating one of her breasts," Ms. Kusc said. "Sending my daughter home in April would be devastating for both of us. Transferring her to another hospital would interrupt her treatment that is going so well."
On Feb. 25, Circuit Court Judge Peter D. Houk rejected the plaintiffs' arguments in favor of the state's plan to close the hospitals. "The testimony presented at the hearing," he wrote in his opinion, "convinces the Court that the hospitals where patients will be transferred are, for the most part, well run and that the services provided are of a superior nature."

Mrs. Romer and her husband, William, 81, who said they had been trying to place their retarded daughter in a group home for many years, are concerned that the state's budget gap, which threatens a plan to open 30 group homes for the mentally retarded, will make it more difficult.

HEADLINE: The World;
Latin Armies Are Looking for Work

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE

DATELINE: MONTEVIDEO , Uruguay

 BODY:
WITH civilian governments now the rule rather than the exception, Latin America's armies have to find new things to do. Counterinsurgency operations against foreign-supported guerrillas, a unifying mission since the 1950's, have faded with the decay of Cuba and the Soviet Union. Border disputes, long a pretext for maintaining standing armies, are increasingly papered over in the name of regional economic integration. And the idea of ruling the country seems to have lost its appeal.
So the armies, many with shrinking budgets, are now grappling to define their mission in the 1990's. Some of them have accepted Washington's offer of aid and training in return for joining the war on cocaine. Others are practicing the capitalism they long preached by running profitable businesses like transport companies, uniform manufacturers and gold mines. 
 But the military's centuries-old role of political arbiter of last resort -- or coup maker -- is never far from discourse.
"Is today's civilian rule the deepening of a trend, or is this just a phase in a long alternating cycle of civil and military rule?" asked Louis W. Goodman, dean of the School of International Service of American University, a sponsor of a recent conference here on civil-military relations.
The United States, which has often supported Latin American military regimes, is now firmly on the side of democracy and civilian rule. Last December, President Bush toured Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Uruguay -- all recently emerged from military rule -- and spoke glowingly of the world's first "hemisphere of democracy."
In the new civilian systems, the military has become just one more lobbying group, competing with political parties, unions and businesses to influence government budgets and policies. In this environment, military men are scrambling to find useful work to defend their budgets.
"Army engineers are building roads, schools and bridges in remote places," Anibal Rejis Romero, a Paraguayan general, said. "We are preparing the infrastructure for agrarian reform settlements."
To strengthen the foundations of civilian rule, several speakers cited the need to break down the barriers between the military and civilian worlds. "We cannot ignore that the distance between the civilian world and the military world in Chile dates back more than half a century," said Arturo Frei, a centrist Chilean senator.
Civilian politicians see military issues as a political dead end, said Julio Maria Sanguinetti, who was President of Uruguay in the late 1980's. "If you get a group of Latin American politicians together in a room and ask, 'Who wants to be foreign minister?' everyone will wave his or her hand in the air," said Mr. Sanguinetti, whose presidency ended a long period of military rule in Uruguay. "But if you ask, 'Who wants to be defense minister?' everyone stares at the floor."
In several South American nations, civilian rule has meant economic shrinkage and reduction of defense budgets. In Argentina, which returned to civilian rule in 1983 but has faced a number of military revolts, the latest in December, the number of army conscripts has fallen from a traditional level of 50,000 a year to about 10,000 today.
"The whole budget is shrinking, so we also have to shrink," said an Argentine Army colonel.
In Argentina, where military-owned companies produce petrochemicals, iron ore and light arms, among other things, the congress is preparing to privatize 21 of these businesses -- about half. Each service would be allowed to keep sales earnings for its own budget.
In neighboring Brazil, which returned to civilian rule in 1985 after 20 years of military governments, military salaries have fallen far behind the 400 percent annual inflation. Last week the Army Minister, Gen. Carlos Tinoco, complained, "A general with 40 years of service is earning the same salary as a driver for congress."
 
A Different Kind of Shot
 Making a pitch for more money in a full-page article in Brazil's largest selling newsweekly, Veja, Air Minister Socrates da Costa Monteiro listed the military's civic action work: road building, river patrols in the Amazon, vaccination campaigns and air traffic control. He did not make any requests for the traditional and costly defense apparatus -- tank units, air wings, submarines and an aircraft carrier -- to protect Brazil from invaders.
 But in the Andean nations of Colombia and Peru, the military does not have to search far for enemies. Despite the decline of Cuba and the Soviet Union, Marxist guerrilla groups fight on, two in Colombia and two in Peru. Even without outside inspiration or aid, the region's economic underclass and ethnic minorities are expected to continue to seek political gain through the force of arms. "Even if you take away the Communist threat, the tremendous social inequality remains," said Johanna Mendelson Forman, director of Democracy Projects for American University.
With the United States no longer giving counterinsurgency military aid to any country in South America, anti-drug aid is often seen as the only way to go for cash-strapped armies. Last week, for example, under heavy United States pressure and in exchange for aid, Bolivia announced that two light infantry battalions are to start patrols against cocaine refining laboratories next month.
The move is opposed by many politicians, unionists and church leaders, in Bolivia and elsewhere. "There is the problem of corruption," said Hugo Medina, a retired commander in chief of Uruguay's armed forces. "And then, you can't take a unit of soldiers and tell them to act like policemen."
Another factor is rapid moves toward regional economic integration. On Tuesday the presidents of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay are to sign an agreement for a Southern Cone Common Market. And newspapers in Buenos Aires reported that diplomats are working on a regional security treaty.
"In Europe, there was first NATO, then the Common Market," said Carlos Maria Lezcano, a Paraguayan defense analyst. "Here it is the reverse. We will have economic integration, then military integration."

For Communities, Knowledge of Polluters is Power

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
LAST month the New Orleans Times Picayune, Louisiana's most influential newspaper, called the American Cyanamid plant 20 miles upriver "the single largest polluting plant in the state." In October, the Louisiana Environmental Action Network, a Baton Rouge-based coalition of citizens groups, designated American Cyanamid its "polluter of the month," criticizing the company for being responsible for a quarter of the 740 million pounds of toxic chemicals discharged into Louisiana's environment in 1988.
How did the newspaper and the environmental group know so much about American Cyanamid's toxic-waste record? They had access to its discharge data as a result of a five-year-old Federal law, the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act, which requires manufacturers to report the total amount of each of some 330 toxic chemicals that have been released into the air, water and land. 
 The data, reported to the Environmental Protection Agency and to states, are listed in the annual Toxics Release Inventory, a compendium of the country's leading toxic-waste dischargers -- and a powerful tool for pressuring factories to reduce pollution.
"It's been very empowering for local people to know who's polluting and to hold these polluters accountable," said Mary Lee Orr, director of the Louisiana Environmental Action Network.
"I don't want to leave the impression that we didn't have these priorities in the past," said James F. Dutcher, a spokesman at the Louisiana American Cyanamid plant. "But there is much more public pressure for us to reduce discharges, and we are reducing them."
But environmentalists say the law has weaknesses. Some dangerous chemicals, among them radioactive substances and the insecticide malathion, are missing from the list. In some cases, a loophole enables manufacturers to circumvent the need to report toxic emissions. Small businesses are exempt from filing a report altogether.
 
Prompted by Bhopal
 The Community Right to Know Act, prompted by the deaths of thousands in a 1984 chemical disaster in Bhopal, India, was approved despite a desperate lobbying campaign by manufacturers, opposition by the White House and public denouncements by the most powerful lawmakers in Congress, who thought the bill would prove to be too much of an onus on industry.
"It was a philosophical leap of faith," said Representative Gerry Sikorski, the Democrat from Minnesota who sponsored the proposal in Congress, "kind of a heartfelt belief that people in communities have an absolute, fundamental right to know what goes into the air their kids breathe, the water they drink and the ground they play on."
Industrial executives and environmental groups agree that the law's most important contribution has been to cause companies to recognize the extent of their discharges and the effect they may have on public health.
The first inventory, published by the E.P.A. in 1989, showed that releases of toxic chemicals totaled billions of pounds in 1987. Some of the nation's largest companies later responded with voluntary programs to reduce such pollution. A.T.&T., for example, said it would stop all emissions of the listed chemicals into the air by the turn of the century.
After the second inventory was made public in 1990, the E.P.A. asked more than 600 companies to cut in half voluntarily emissions of the 17 most dangerous toxic chemicals, including benzene, cyanide, mercury and chromium, by 1995. "If we succeed," said William K. Reilly, the Administrator of the E.P.A., "this program could set the pace for a new cooperative way of addressing the nation's environmental goals."
The law has galvanized small citizens groups. According to a report in Working Notes, a newsletter in Washington that tracks the use of the law, an environmental group in northern California raised concerns last year about the storage and use of chlorine in treating cooling water at a Chevron refinery in Richmond. Chevron stopped using the chemical at that plant last December.
The Raytheon Company pledged in December that it would use safer water-based solutions to clean computer circuit boards after a group in Massachusetts criticized the company's use of chemicals that deplete the ozone layer in the upper atmosphere.
Despite its growing ability to influence environmental struggles throughout the country, the right-to-know law has flaws, said Paul Orum, editor of Working Notes. Any business with nine or fewer employees is exempted from reporting discharges. And an estimate by a congressional research group, the Office of Technology Assessment, said emissions from these sources could total billions of pounds.
In a report released earlier this month, Mr. Orum and three co-authors said that companies have disposed of at least 200 million pounds of toxic chemicals under the recycling exemption while sidestepping reporting requirements. "This loophole is undermining the law because it allows companies to claim waste reductions when, in fact, they aren't reducing pollution at all," Mr. Orum said.
Few states have reacted to the right-to-know law as aggressively as Louisiana, which has some of the worst environmental problems in the country. Four plants by themselves, including American Cyanamid, Shell, and two owned by Freeport McMoRan, discharged 460 million pounds of toxic chemicals in 1988, more than all the plants in Ohio and nearly three times as much as those in New Jersey. The state Department of Environmental Quality called in the three companies and other top toxic-waste dischargers in the state and demanded that they establish plans to reduce emissions.
Since its plant opened 20 miles from New Orleans in the early 1950's, American Cyanamid has disposed of most of its toxic wastes by pumping them into a well 3,000 feet underground. Some 75 billion pounds of chemicals have been injected underground. The disposal method was certified as safe in November by the E.P.A., but Louisiana has sought for several years to close the well because of concern that chemicals will contaminate ground water.
Mr. Dutcher, the plant spokesman, said last week that 750 jobs and a nearly $25 million annual payroll could be at stake if the plant was forced to change its disposal practices.
Louisiana, which has a $900 million deficit and an array of economic ills, took note. When American Cyanamid submitted its plan last year to reduce the discharging of toxic waste into the well by 17 percent, state officials deemed the proposal "satisfactory."

As the Dust Settles, Attention Turns to New Arms Sales

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
AT war's end, and with a potentially chaotic peace ahead in the Middle East, the Bush Administration made clear last week that it was preparing to arm its friends in the region against a sea of trouble.
After forceful pledges this month by both President Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d to work toward reducing the flow of conventional arms and defense technology to the region, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney last week seemed to adjust the Administration's course. He gave the most detailed explanation to date of the emerging policy on arms and security, which can be boiled down to this: arms for America's friends and arms control for its potential foes. 
 In laying out the rationale, Mr. Cheney said the first order of business in the Persian Gulf must be the security of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the other gulf Arab states to make the region safe for an American withdrawal. Then, the United States must cooperate with other industrialized nations to stem the flow of critical technologies that advance the spread of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons, along with the long-range missiles to deliver them.
That is the security imperative Mr. Cheney described.
The political imperative, articulated by other senior officials, was that America's allies, those who stood up against Saddam Hussein, must be seen as the clear winners in a region that respects power and performance. Therefore, the winners must receive tangible rewards. But there was also an economic imperative, which left the Administration with a scarcity of funds or other economic benefits to offer.
What Mr. Bush could offer, however, was something devoutly wished by many developing nations: access to America's arms and technology bazaar. And for those who couldn't afford to shop, the Administration was asking Congress to guarantee credits for cash-strapped allies at the Export-Import Bank. In that way, American defense contractors would not lose business to European nations that subsidize weapons sales abroad.
Many members of Congress, who had hoped that Mr. Bush's new world order was going to make a new and stronger effort to restrain the Middle East arms race alongside the new peace process that Mr. Bush and Mr. Baker say they want, were disappointed.
To some members, it seemed a cynical exercise that on the plains of victory, the Administration would sow the seeds of future militarism, arming to the teeth the lightly populated desert kingdoms and emirates along with some of their newfound protectors, whose blossoming arsenals would only spur Israel to outdistance them further and perhaps incite Iran to rearm more quickly and send Syria on a new arms spree in Moscow.
For their part, the Soviets seemed to recognize -- then shrink from -- the old instincts of the superpower rivalry that has fueled the arms race in the Middle East for four decades. Moscow's Foreign Minister and its delegate to the United Nations both called on Washington to agree to a period of restraint in the Middle East, but Mr. Cheney argued this would effectively serve as a disloyal arms "embargo" against America's friends.
With the State Department forging ahead with a sale of 46 General Dynamics F-16 jets to Cairo, part of a package long in the pipeline, the resumption of arms transfers was a reminder of the resource drain they would have on some of Washington's economically strained allies, notably Egypt and Israel, at a time when major challenges of population, immigration, water resources and economic restructuring lie ahead.
Mr. Bush has already forgiven Egypt's $7.1 billion military debt, and the new signals of a return to business as usual come as Egypt's unreformed economy continues to collapse. If Egypt, at peace with Israel, cannot rechannel its resources away from arms, who can?
 
Outfitting a Policeman
 The United States has been trying to find and outfit a policeman in the Persian Gulf since the Nixon Administration, when the Shah of Iran was given the keys to the American arsenal. The newest policeman is a collective: Saudi Arabia, Kuwait leading the Gulf Cooperation Council states (Bahrain, Qatar, Oman and the United Arab Emirates), plus Egypt and Syria.
The Bush Administration is seeking a postwar security arrangement built on a presence for the United States Central Command, according to Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. With Arab ground forces armed mostly by the United States, the Central Command will be able to take part in, if not supervise, an alliance built around the Arab allies who fought Iraq. They will be backed by an expanded United States naval presence with greater access to Arab ports, and by regular deployments of American fighter wings and ground troops for visits and exercises.
In a matter of weeks, Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, head of the Central Command, will submit a blueprint for the new alliance, including a forecast of the level of armaments it will need.
Part of the pressure on the Administration to back away from controlling arms sales in the region may be simply that Saudi Arabia and Kuwait are clinging to the presence of 440,000 American troops, whose departure would require the Arab leaders to come to grips with their future relations with Saddam Hussein, still armed and increasingly desperate in Baghdad. Senator Joseph Biden, Democrat of Delaware, said a "top national security council official" told him Americans should "not be overambitious" in seeking Middle East arms control, and that "defense cooperation will provide far more security than arms control."
But the window for arms control in the Middle East may remain open for some time. The Saudis, while not eager for the American army to leave, are also not in any hurry to plow billions into new arms purchases. Neither are the Kuwaitis, who face a daunting rebuilding task. The gulf Arabs certainly are hoping that a peace process, both on the Arab-Israeli front and in the Persian Gulf, will relieve them of some of the defense burdens ahead.
 
One Less Worry
 In an interview Friday, General Powell almost begged the question of whether there is a future military threat in the area that requires large forces. "There will not be a fourth largest army headed by Mr. Saddam Hussein in 1995," he said. "Perhaps one of the fortunate aspects of this entire unfortunate war is that it came at this time when we did have the capability to deal rather handily with the fourth largest army in the world."
Some pressure for new arms sales can be expected from defense contractors, who face a big contraction in United States spending for the rest of the decade. Without foreign orders for the M1-A1 tank, General Dynamics might have to shut down its production lines in Michigan and Ohio before the Army finds the money in the late 1990's to design a new main battle tank. And if McDonnell-Douglas, Lockheed, Northrop, Grumman and General Dynamics don't win their share of warplane sales to the Pentagon in this decade, foreign sales may be the only thing that can keep their production lines open.
These are big commercial interests that mean tens of thousands of jobs in the United States, and any arms control movement in Congress will run into countervailing pressures to sell. Advocates of arms control also will be hard pressed to oppose what appear to be legitimate security needs for defensive systems, such as air defense, anti-missile protection and interceptor aircraft.
In the final analysis, however, the arms race in the Middle East has never been more than a symptom of the intractible political and diplomatic problems that plague the region. There can be no farewell to arms while strong currents of Shiite fundamentalism seek to violently carve their channels across the Muslim world and while Palestinian nationalists fight to win a homeland against Israel's struggle for recognition and security.
The greatest stimulus to arms control, therefore, will be an active peace process between Israel and the Arabs and, in the Persian Gulf, among Iraq, Iran and the Arabian potentates.

Yugoslavia Finds That Breaking Up Is Hard to Do

BYLINE: By STEPHEN ENGELBERG

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Yugoslavia

 BODY:
YUGOSLAVIA'S six republics are like people mired in a disintegrating marriage. They hurl insults and scream divorce so often, even casual acquaintances conclude the union will not last. But when they visit the lawyers and calculate the costs of splitting up, they return, reluctantly, to the marriage counselors.
So it was last week, which began with the de facto secession by Serbia, the largest republic, and ended with a resumption of talks among the republics over the future of this multi-ethnic country. 
 For the past few months the Yugoslavs have seemed bent on convincing the world, and each other, that theirs is a country on the verge of dissolution. The republics have refused to pay taxes to the federal government, moved closer to legal secession and formed their own militias. Croatia and Slovenia even designed new currencies.
Among the many people who found these steps persuasive were American intelligence analysts: they recently said they believed that Yugoslavia would fall apart within 18 months.
Many officials in Yugoslavia's republics now privately say their bellicose actions are a bit deceiving. The renewed stirring of national pride within the ethnically diverse republics is real enough, they say. But officials acknowledge that most of the daily maneuvering is political theater, aimed at influencing negotiations that could well end with Yugoslavia remaining together, though with much looser ties.
"It's like a cold war between two bullocks butting heads," said Darko Bekic, an adviser to the President of Croatia, Franjo Tudjman. "There's a consciousness on both sides that this is not Lithuania, it's the Balkans. The hatred and degree of armament is formidable. If war really starts, you'd have 5,000 deaths in the first 24 hours."
The events of the last week are evidence of the republics' willingness both to lock horns and to pull back from confrontation.
Last weekend Slobodan Milosevic, Serbia's leader, mobilized local militia and announced that his republic no longer recognized the authority of the nation's federal executive body. Bolislav Jovic, the Serb who heads the eight-member federal body, followed with his own resignation, as did two other members. Croatia, the second largest republic, put its paramilitary forces on alert.
Western nations weighed in with stern warnings. Meanwhile, the Croats refused to be drawn into combat with a breakaway group of Serbs within Croatia who announced their own secession.
By Thursday, leaders of the republics were gathering in Belgrade for renewed discussions. Mr. Jovic withdrew his resignation. The army promised not to interfere with the talks, although with the ambiguous proviso that it would prevent "armed inter-ethnic conflicts" and defend the existing borders. The latter was interpreted as a pointed warning against secession by any republic.
On the surface, life returned to the edgy semi-anarchy that passes for normal in this fractured nation. In fact, the week has clarified some important issues. It now seems clear that the army is unwilling to settle the disputes among the republics unilaterally. The presidents of the two republics that have shouted the loudest about breaking away, Slovenia and Croatia, were the first to push for talks aimed at preserving unity.
The most significant development, however, was the continued weakening in the position of Mr. Milosevic, the former Communist who was elected to the Serbian presidency last year with pledges to support Serbian nationalism and oppose swift transition to a free-market economy.
Last year's elections in Croatia and Slovenia were won by nationalist anti-Communists who promise rapid privatization and the creation of a market economy. They believe Serbia's insistence on retaining key elements of the Communist economic system will drag Yugoslavia to ruin.
Slovenia and Croatia say they also oppose the current federal system of government because Serbia, as the largest republic, has the decisive voice on such important questions as the size of the army.
The two republics have been pressing for a loose alliance of sovereign nations that would collaborate on a few issues, such as national defense and, perhaps, a currency. Until now, Serbia has demanded that Yugoslavia keep the existing arrangement.
These seemingly irreconcilable differences created an impasse that persisted as long as Mr. Milosevic retained tight hold on the media, the Parliament, and other traditional Communist instruments of power in Serbia. In addition, his strident nationalism continually reinforced the nationalist sentiments in the other republics, particularly Croatia.
But earlier this month, Mr. Milosevic was damaged, perhaps fatally, by the rise of a popular anti-Communist movement in his republic. The first demonstrations left two dead and scores hurt and were not put down until army tanks rolled through Belgrade. For the first time in his career as Serbian leader, and before that Communist Party chief, Mr. Milosevic found himself furiously backpedaling. He agreed to dismiss the senior management of state-run television and released opposition politicians jailed after the protests.
The reclusive Mr. Milosevic even held a four-hour session with a handpicked group of students and professors at Belgrade University.
With the next big demonstration scheduled in Belgrade for next Wednesday, the Slovenes and Croats reason that Mr. Milosevic is finally ready to talk seriously about rewriting the 1974 constitution. But they also fear that this is the perfect moment for the Serbs to stir up new ethnic unrest that could force the army's generals to intervene.
"In think Milosevic will go, but it will take some time," said Srdja Popovic, a well known human rights lawyer in Belgrade. "There may be more violence, things of that kind. There has to be a lot more pressure before anything happens."

HEADLINE: The Region;
With a Final Jolt, New York's Budget Gap Is Open to Its Widest -- For Now

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
AFTER weeks of warnings by assorted Cassandras that the earth was opening beneath New York City's budget, Mayor David N. Dinkins officially acknowledged that it had last week, conceding that the total gap in the $29 billion budget for the coming fiscal year would top $3 billion.
That new estimate is more than $800 million above the projection Mr. Dinkins made when he released his preliminary budget just eight weeks ago, but it was hardly a surprise. Proposed cuts in state aid and rising costs had made it clear that the budget was out of whack again, continuing a pattern of fiscal troubles that the Mayor said had "become the defining reality of our government." 
 So when will the bad news end?
"That's very heady stuff, and you're never right," said First Deputy Mayor Norman Steisel. "You know the story about the 6-foot economist who drowned in a river that was on average 5 feet deep."
But if the Dinkins administration hews to the broad plan it set out last week -- much of it drawn directly from the administration's varied critics -- it might have a chance of dealing with the bad news in new ways. The Mayor held a daylong meeting with business, labor and civic leaders and his own commissioners to knock heads and announce that it was time to work together, something those groups had been begging him to do.
Mr. Dinkins also said -- for what some of his second-guessers thought was the first time -- that the city's problems were bigger than the latest pieces of bad news and required more than the usual mix of higher taxes and spending cuts. He had already proposed more than $1 billion in taxes and $1.2 billion in service cuts and productivity savings to close the gap before last week's announcement. The reality, he suggested, is that for some years the city has been spending more than it could afford and big changes were necessary.
Just how big those changes will be remains to be seen. As a start, Mr. Dinkins said the city would seek major concessions from its union workforce, trying in some cases to take back gains the unions just won in wage settlements granted by Mr. Dinkins. If that happens, the administration said, it might be able to avoid much of the more than $800 million in threatened cuts, which could be devastating. If those were made, the Sanitation Department would have trimmed 33 percent of its budget since last fall, for example, and the Parks Department 37 percent.
At the unions' request, Mr. Dinkins agreed that both sides should keep silent about the substance of their talks, to avoid the embarrassing leaks, lurches, mixed signals and mutual recriminations that have dominated so much of the last year at City Hall.
"I think this was a very good week for the Mayor," said Barry Feinstein, president of Local 237 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, who only two weeks ago said the administration was so confused it was "going into the toilet."
"Without talking about what we did at our meeting," Mr. Feinstein added, "it's clear to me and, I think, my colleagues that what the Mayor said a week or 10 days ago about putting his hands on the city and running it, clearly he's doing. Now whether I'm happy or not about what he wants is not the issue. All of us have the view that it's important to deal with our city's problems."
The Mayor will have an uphill fight, and union leaders make it clear they are not ready to give back anything yet. But that Mr. Feinstein struck such a conciliatory note was a sign that Mr. Dinkins had finally presented his problem with a comprehensive carrot-and-stick approach that gave the unions a way to prepare their members for the probability that something would have to give.
For much of his first 15 months in office, Mr. Dinkins has been whipsawed by the competing demands of the liberal-labor coalition that elected him and a business-financial establishment skeptical of his ability and resolve, and he has striven to mediate between them. Asked last week if he could get through the problem without angering someone, he said: "No, no, for sure. There are some people who are angry now, before we get to this last billion." Asked if there were things he would have done differently, knowing what he knows now, the Mayor said, "There probably are, but I'm not going to examine and enumerate them, because frankly we're still in this process."
There were signs that the Mayor was willing to take his lumps. In a meeting with social-service advocates last week, one senior mayoral aide said Mr. Dinkins reminded them with some asperity that "he could stand on the street and talk about dying babies as well as they could," but did not have enough money to do all that needed to be done.
The Mayor said he hoped social-service groups, which played an important role in his campaign, could give him room to maneuver. "It's not enough for the activists, the advocates, the service providers simply to speak about what they need in their own areas," he said. "I agree with them about that. But I have the responsibility to look at the total picture, and when one does that you have to order priorities and make judgments."
One businessman who often advises the Mayor said he thought Mr. Dinkins had recently "internalized" a deeper understanding of how the fiscal problems could overwhelm him if he did not master them, and of how only by mastering them could he succeed politically. But undoubtedly the hardest part is still to come.
"The challenge is to carry through on the right steps they've taken," said Ronald Shelp, president of the New York City Partnership and the New York Chamber of Commerce and Industry. "I think the Mayor has to be the leader, and we all have to be around the table. He has to lead it, and he's taken the first steps."
The full force of the city's budget problems occurred months after the beginning of the regional economic downturn that helped drive them. Similarly, most economists say, an economic revival will not by itself solve those problems, even if it happens by next year, as the more optimistic forecasters suggest.
"I think they'll have two years of struggle to cut back jobs on the city workforce," said Rosemary Scanlon, chief economist of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. "It's never easy to grapple with a budget that seems to be sliding out from under you. But it doesn't last forever, even at that."
For his part, Mr. Dinkins says he intends to be around when better times return. Last week, he got a gift from his old friend Representative Charles B. Rangel of Harlem, a small plaque that reads, "I consider the day lost if I don't catch hell about something."
"I've taken this off my wall," Mr. Rangel wrote. "Right now, you need it more than I do, and I hope soon we can both pass it on to someone."

HEADLINE: The Damage Was Not Collateral

 BODY:
The first independent assessment of the damage done to Iraq by allied bombing has painted a grim picture of catastrophic devastation. A United Nations team described the effects of the bombing as "near apocalyptic," knocking Iraq back "to a pre-industrial age."
The facts may not quite support the hyperbole, but the assessment has cast the bomb damage in a new light. The bulk of the damage found by the U.N. team was not accidental or "collateral," but the intended consequence of the successful air campaign to destroy Iraq's war machine by attacking its industrial base and urban infrastructure. 
 The findings raise questions about how much of that bombing was needed, or justified. That debate will go on, but meanwhile there is urgent need to respond to the devastation in Iraq. The U.N. Security Council recognized this when it eased sanctions to allow for humanitarian aid.
The Council was right to stop short of scrapping the sanctions. It is decidedly not in U.S. interests to alienate the Iraqi people permanently or to let the poorest Iraqis suffer interminably. But any relaxation must be measured. Economic sanctions remain the only way to pressure Iraq to destroy its remaining chemical and biological capabilities and to give up its nuclear ambitions. The best way to satisfy these competing objectives is to provide the necessities of life and disaster relief, but maintain a partial embargo until Iraq disarms further.
The U.N. team found that "most means of modern life support have been destroyed or rendered tenuous," including food supply, power generation, water purification, garbage disposal, sewage treatment and other essentials.
Was the bombing of Iraq important to the outcome of the war? The air force continues to believe in strategic bombing, striking targets in the enemy homeland that, broadly construed, affect military capacity: power plants, telephone exchanges, broadcast antennas, roads and bridges.
In air force doctrine, strategic bombing can compel surrender, without a ground war, by destroying industry and infrastructure and by sapping the enemy's will to resist. But bombing city targets did not make Saddam Hussein capitulate. Bombing Iraqi forces in the Kuwaiti theater of operations had a more decisive effect, causing the mass defection and surrender of Iraqi troops.
The air force devoted almost a third of its sorties to striking cities -- with predictably deplorable results for civilians. The U.N. report quotes Iraqi estimates that 9,000 homes were destroyed, leaving some 72,000 people homeless. How many civilians died is not known.
Some of the destruction was caused by wayward bombs. Based on Air Force figures, 70 percent of the bombs dropped in the war missed their targets. Even precision-guided bombs missed their targets 10 percent of the time.
Now the allies are, wisely, moving to mitigate the bombing's effects. While Washington is right to keep pressure on Baghdad to disarm, the U.S. has no interest in prolonging the misery of the Iraqi people. That could lead to the disintegration of Iraq and greater instability in the region.
Oil exports and arms imports must remain prohibited, but humanitarian aid can safely be provided. Food and disaster relief from Americans and the allies could help get the Iraqis back on their feet. That would be the humane thing to do. It could also be prudent.

HEADLINE: A Better Reason to Expand I.R.A.'s

 BODY:
Lloyd Bentsen of Texas and more than 70 other senators are proposing to solve the nation's number one economic problem -- a 40 percent drop in the net national savings rate in the 1980's -- by expanding the use of individual retirement accounts.
Mr. Bentsen's plan would reinstate the right, taken away by the 1986 tax reform, of upper-income workers covered by company pension plans to deposit up to $2,000 tax free into an I.R.A. It would also allow withdrawals for the purchase of a first home, college tuition and medical catastrophe. And the plan would create a Super I.R.A., which would provide no up-front deduction but would exempt interest from taxes as long as contributions were kept on deposit for at least five years. 
 Mr. Bentsen's plan won't be enough to turn the savings rate around. But the Super I.R.A. is an imaginative wrinkle that might attract savers. That alone makes his plan worth trying.
Even before I.R.A.'s were cut back, they did not spur much new saving. Too few families deposited money; some who did merely shuffled funds from taxable accounts. That doesn't raise private savings and, by raising the deficit, actually decreases public savings. On balance, national savings might have increased, but probably not by much.
One of the reasons few individuals joined the program was the penalty for early withdrawals, before age 59 1/2. Young workers with modest incomes couldn't be sure that an emergency wouldn't arise. That's why Mr. Bentsen's Super I.R.A., which doesn't lock in funds for more than a few years, might prove more attractive.
Other than lowering the deficit, Washington doesn't have many ways to boost savings. Besides, Mr. Bentsen's plan wouldn't widen the deficit, because the new budget law effectively requires Congress to raise some other tax to make up for the loss to the Treasury. As long as Congress makes sure that the new taxes fall, roughly, on the same upper-income families that are likely to take advantage of the new I.R.A.'s, the Bentsen plan could do little harm. And it might do a little good. For an economy starved for savings, that is enough.

Arms Sales Heaven

BYLINE: By Leslie H. Gelb

 BODY:
Syria, Egypt, Iraq and Turkey each have more main battle tanks than Britain or France. Syria, Iraq and Egypt each fly nearly as many combat aircraft as Germany or France or Britain.
 Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Saudi Arabia and Syria have purchased from abroad about $125 billion in arms since 1983. This accounts for more than half the worldwide arms trade. 
 Why are they doing this? Can President Bush do anything to bring the situation under control?
 These nations are not buying all those arms to fight for a Palestinian homeland. They treat Palestinians the way Americans treated Indians.
 Nor do they arm themselves so heavily because they think Israel will grab their territory or oil. Not even the most paranoid Arab fears that.
 There are two simple and powerful reasons for Mideast Muslims making their territories look more like arsenals than countries. First, most of them hate and distrust each other. They have killed hundreds of thousands of their brethren in wars over the last 40 years. Second, they hate Israel, and most would like to destroy it. Israel intruded into their established world and humiliated them in battle many times. Even today they know that Israel, itself an armed camp, could defeat any two of them simultaneously.
 These Arab states and Iran have very little incentive to accept limits on their arms purchases. They live in constant fear that one of their Muslim brothers will gain the upper hand and attack. Also, stopping the arms race would guarantee Israel's continued superiority in military technology and its monopoly in nuclear weapons. Thus the arms race spirals upward and the wars become more terrible.
 The arms exporters understand all this full well. But only on the rarest occasions have they denied arms requests from their oil suppliers. The industrialized world simply wants to keep the oil countries happy and buying arms to help offset the oil bills.
 No one understands this mutual dependency better than the Mideast oil producers, who also know that oil money is their best weapon against Israel.
 Israel cannot afford to compete with its neighbors in arms imports over the long run. It is already strapped with an enormous defense budget. That burden and the goal of keeping military superiority explain why Israel now calls for sharp cuts in arms exports to the Middle East.
To manage these eye-crossing interests and maneuvers over arms, the Bush Administration has developed the following approach:
* Ban sales of chemical, biological and nuclear arms and related know-how, and the long-range missiles capable of delivering such weapons.
(Reasonable, but many Mideast nations already have some of these capabilities. Also missile exporters -- North Korea and China, for example -- will not abide by limits.)
* Consider setting limits on sales of aircraft, tanks, artillery and smart missiles, but in the meantime sell what buyers want -- "to see to it that they're secure," as Defense Secretary Cheney put it.
(As long as other suppliers do not restrain their sales, there is no sense putting ourselves at a competitive disadvantage.)
* Argue that Iraq's defeat has diminished the biggest threat to all and that all can now safely buy less.
(A solid tactic, but the Administration already expects a substantial increase in demand from the victors.)
* Negotiate confidence-building measures like Arabs dropping their economic boycott against Israel and Israel providing better treatment for Palestinians.
(Sensible, but it will not reduce arms demands.)
* Seek peace settlements between Arabs and Israel and between Israel and the Palestinians.
(An essential ingredient for eventual arms restraint on the Arab-Israeli front, but it does not deal with the inter-Arab quarrels, which also trigger demands for arms.)
The Administration's plan is practical and realistic. Too much so.
It is weighed down by business-as-usual realism. There seems nothing in it to exploit the death of the Soviet threat and the diminished value of Soviet arms sales. It contains little to suggest building on the victorious anti-Iraq coalition molded by Mr. Bush -- or escaping the tragic history of Mideast arms races.
Mr. Bush is in a strong position to press other arms exporters for joint limits on sales and to link arms sales creatively with peace diplomacy. But to surmount this arms quagmire, he has to think bigger than his aides and put his new prestige on the line.

HEADLINE: A Sideshow Stole the St. Patrick's Day Parade

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The sideshow that took command of New York City's St. Patrick's Day Parade this year stole from the Irish people the one day of the year when all eyes focus on the political, economic and human rights realities that beset their troubled homeland. 
 Headlines were dominated by comparatively frivolous goings-on among the Mayor's office, gays and lesbians -- whose expectations of fair and equal treatment no one questions -- and the parade organizers who were caught by surprise and thrown off stride, to say the least.
Where was the talk of Joe Doherty, now in his eighth year at the Metropolitan Correctional Center, a living symbol of justice miscarried? Or talk of the tens of thousands of young Irish immigrants now crowding our neighborhoods in Ridgewood, Queens, the Inwood section of Manhattan or the Bainbridge section of the Bronx, struggling to seize the American dream and put their skills and talents to work? Where was the talk of Gaelic Park and its fate under the Metropolitan Transportation Authority?
Where was the talk of human rights abuses against minority Roman Catholics in Northern Ireland? Their chronic unemployment? Their lack of due process? Federal implementation of the MacBride Principles of fair employment in Northern Ireland, that earned the Irish patriot Sean MacBride the Nobel Peace Prize?
It was lost in a verbal stew, all froth and no substance, that's where.
Next year, let's get it right. Let's give our attention and thanks to the thousands of men and women who commit themselves unselfishly to countless hours of hard labor 52 weeks a year on these priority issues in the Irish-American community.
When the chance to bring this agenda to the attention of our country and the world is telescoped into an annual 72-hour period, at best, let's hope that the focus will be squarely on the real issues and not the sideshow. St. Patrick, St. Patrick's Day and those committed to real Irish-American causes deserve much, much better treatment.

HEADLINE: Utility Act Hampers Power Independents

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Independent power producers have over the last decade become this country's most efficient generators of electrical power. Independent studies estimate that the independent producers, which sell power to regulated utilities, will generate about half of new electric capacity in the next decade. More than a third of that will be produced by nonfossil energy sources, including biomass, solid waste, hydroelectric turbines, geothermal, wind and solar technologies. The remaining two-thirds is produced with innovative technology that primarily employs coal and natural gas. 
 Some experts say oil import fees or gasoline taxes are needed to wean America from foreign energy. Others have called for Federal subsidies to make alternative fuels such as methanol, wind and solar economically competitive. The independent producers are already competitive; their only need is the freedom to compete fairly in the marketplace.
Proposals pending in Congress and before the Bush Administration would give the independents that freedom by amending the 56-year-old Public Utility Holding Company Act, which makes it harder for these small producers to provide competitive and efficiently priced electrical power by imposing on them the same regulatory burdens applied to the country's big utilities.
Over the next decade, the United States will invest $100 billion to $200 billion in new electric generating capacity. Freeing the independents to produce this power could mean a 20 percent gain in efficiency, saving as much as $40 billion.
Creating a regulatory environment in which electricity can be produced in the most economically efficient fashion is a simple, straightforward and low-risk policy goal that should be part of any comprehensive energy strategy.

HEADLINE: Businesses Helping New York City Less

BYLINE: By SARAH BARTLETT

 BODY:
New York City's banking and business community lacks leadership and is not giving the city the same kind of help it did in the fiscal crisis of the 1970's, many executives say.
During the 1970's, for instance, the city's biggest banks held large amounts of New York City bonds in their investment portfolios, which gave them a strong vested interest in the city's future. 
 Several banks had chief executives, like David Rockefeller at Chase Manhattan and Walter B. Wriston at Citicorp, whose prominence and forceful personalities helped focus attention on the city's travails and garner support in Albany and Washington. The largest banks all had economists who specialized in studying New York's economy, and who acted as an early-warning system about the city's problems.
"The banks became very much a part of the process," said Richard Shinn, former chief executive of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, who worked closely with Gov. Hugh L. Carey during the crisis of the mid-1970's. "The business community this time is somewhat less focused."
The executives interviewed gave several reasons for the reticence of business leaders.
Many major banks are struggling with their own financial problems, as real-estate loans have soured and they have been forced to raise fresh capital. Many have little profit to shelter, and those that do have profits derive fewer benefits from municipal securities because of changes in the Federal tax laws. Thus, few banks are large holders of tax-exempt securities any more. Partly as a result, no large New York bank and only one large Wall Street firm now has a full-time economist studying New York City.
Also, many banks are run by a new generation of executives who have yet to develop the kinds of public personas displayed by a Rockefeller or a Wriston. There is only one banker, for instance, serving on either of Mayor Dinkins's two task forces focusing on the city's economic problems. Although those groups are populated with chief executives from other industries, the lone banker, Carol Parry, is a senior vice president at the Manufacturers Hanover Corporation.
"The banks and insurance companies are not in a position to offer as much help as they did in the mid-'70's," said James Robinson, chief executive of American Express.
But the financial industry is not the only that is suffering. The recent wave of mergers and intensifying competition have made many chief executives more mindful of the bottom line, and less interested in providing support for a geographic area that is shrinking in its importance to their businesses.
"The reality is, many more companies have become less tied to the city and more global in their thinking," said Karen Gerard, a former deputy mayor who is a vice president of the relocation firm of Moran, Stahl & Boyer. "The attachment is less than it was." As an example, some point to the serious consideration Morgan Stanley & Company has given to leaving the city.
New York's business leaders have always been more detached than others'. Many top executives are from other parts of the country and do not share the local boosterism that is often found in smaller cities. They frequently live in wealthy suburbs, so their daytime exposure to urban problems is not reinforced at night. And the sheer number of companies in such a wide variety of different industries makes it hard to identify a concentrated power structure, as is not the case in cities dominated by one or two employers.
 
Thinking of a Small Town
 "With a couple of hundred thousand businesses here, the order of magnitude makes it that much more difficult," said Sally Hernandez-Pinero, Deputy Mayor for Finance and Development, who says she is striving to make local companies think of the city as more of a small town.
As a result of all these factors, there appear to be few business leaders who have either the commitment or the detailed understanding of the city's financial problems to be able to provide counsel or assistance to City Hall.
When about a dozen top business leaders were recently asked what advice they would give to the Mayor about the fiscal crisis, most were ready to offer general comments, but many declined to give specific recommendations, saying they did not know the details of the city's finances. They also said they were afraid to criticize the Dinkins administration's handling of the city's fiscal problems for fear that it would be perceived in racial terms, as the white Establishment ganging up on the city's first black Mayor.
Even the New York City Partnership, a business group formed in 1979 as an outgrowth of the fiscal crisis, has been relatively passive until recently, many executives said. Although the group's president, Ronald K. Shelp, says it is active in lobbying state legislators and in lending executives and resources to the Mayor's task forces, it was not until early last week that the Partnership took a forceful position on the city's financial problems.
"We're getting a lot of flak. People are saying, 'When are you guys going to start kicking and screaming?' " said one member of the organization, discussing its decision to send a delegation to the Mayor on Tuesday with a letter calling for more concerted action. The group, about eight top business executives, met with the Mayor to discuss the city's fiscal problems and urged him to permanently cut the size of the city government.
About the only place where business leaders do seem to be getting more actively involved is the Mayor's management advisory task force, an amalgam of business executives, union leaders and public officials whose mandate is to make concrete proposals about better ways to run the government.
Some executives on the task force have dismissed it as little more than a debating society. But others point to two proposals now being seriously considered by the Mayor: one to consolidate the administration of the city's six economic development agencies, and the other to introduce 'managed Medicaid.' The latter, used in many places, including California, would require Medicaid patients to consistently use the same hospitals, in order to eliminate duplicate record-keeping.

HEADLINE: PRACTICAL TRAVELER;
Taking a Trip With a Charter

BYLINE: By BETSY WADE

 BODY:
THE appearance of ads for charter flights is a harbinger of spring. In winter, especially this one, there are plenty of trans-Atlantic scheduled-airline seats available, but when the weather begins to warm, ads for charter airlines and operators pop up like crocuses.
The charter prices are normally less than those of the scheduled airlines but in their current fare wars, some prices are appearing for spring that beat the charter companies'. The bottom fares on the scheduled lines are nonrefundable and sometimes require purchase 30 days ahead, and the number of seats available is tightly controlled. 
 Charter operators may offer a discount for someone paying in advance, but if the seat is available, it can be bought now, later or the day before before departure without a penalty. This means that, unlike scheduled airlines, all charter passengers pay just about the same fare.
Most public charter airlines these days make at least weekly trips to and from their destinations, and some have more frequent service -- a far cry from the days when everyone had to become a member of some semimythical group to enable an "affinity charter" flight to make a single trip out and back.
In spring these companies expand their programs to accommodate added trans-Atlantic demand in the high season and serving places where sales will not sustain daily service. Last winter charters represented about 3 percent of overseas flights; in summer that number grows to more than 5 percent.
 Some consumers shy away from charters because they consider them less reliable than regularly scheduled flights. "In America a stigma attaches to the word charter," said Janice Holden of Martinair, a big Dutch charter company. "Europeans always fly scheduled airlines for business and go charter for their vacations."
Indeed, a lawyer who specializes in travel-consumer litigation, Thomas A. Dickerson of Manhattan, says charter flights, in a time of uncertain economic health among airlines, may be financially superior to regularly scheduled air transportation. He says the safest is the public charter, the most widely offered, which requires that both the tour operator and the air carrier set up separate accounts for each flight in which consumer money is held in escrow until the trip is completed. Public charters also require the tour operator to have a surety bond.
Every contract for a public charter must state clearly that it is a public charter. When passengers sign the contract, they may make their check payable to the escrow account, which is safer than making it out to the travel agent.

 Charter flights to Ireland, Northern Ireland and Scotland operated by Sceptre Charters can be $200 cheaper in the high season than the advance purchase tickets sold by scheduled airlines for the same routes, according to Angela Pelosi, manager of the company. Scepter sells seats only through travel agents.
The flights are mostly aboard L-1011's. The planes are set up in typical charter fashion, with one-class seating, and well-packed in. The widebody charter L-1011's, according to Mrs. Pelosi, carry 362 passengers; a scheduled carrier using this plane for a flight with one class may carry 315 passengers, or 226 in three classes.
Mrs. Pelosi said tickets for this summer were being sold at $20 to $40 off until March 31. Here are a few of them, not including customs and immigration fees and departure taxes:
On May 17, Friday evening flights to Shannon from Kennedy Airport will start for $429 round trip May 17 to June 14. For the high season, until Aug. 24, the Shannon fare is $449. As of March 18, the best scheduled airline fare to Shannon for May is $499.
More flights will be added to the schedule in June, both to Belfast, Knock and Dublin and Glasgow. For tickets sold this week, the Glasgow fare is $499 and the Knock fare is $459. Return dates are not restricted.
Sceptre does not list its telephone number in the directory, but travel agents are able to reach it.
 
A Cut Above Economy
Two big charter companies, Martinair, which flies to Amsterdam, and Balair, which flies to Switzerland, offer weekly trans-Atlantic service all winter from Florida, but when spring comes they start service from the West Coast and later the Northeast.
These two lines have also added a further wrinkle: they have begun selling a class above economy with more space per passenger, eliminating the customary cramped seating of charters. Balair calls it Relax class and Martinair calls it Star class, but the service is comparable to business class on scheduled airlines. On Balair's DC-10's, according to Kathy Schindelheim, a spokeswoman, there are 63 of these better seats and 264 economy seats. This makes a total of 327 passengers; a scheduled airline operating a DC-10 with three classes might accommodate 215 to 258.
Martinair has 24 of the better seats on its 747's and 767's, said Ms. Holden, assistant vice president. The 747 carries 513 people, contrasted with the scheduled airlines' total of 387 or 428 in three classes. The Martinair 767 carries 266, as against 163 to 209 in a scheduled airliner in three classes.
Balair's Thursday flights out of Kennedy to Geneva and Zurich resume May 2; Saturday fights from Kennedy to Basel and Zurich resume June 15. Tuesday flights from San Francisco to Switzerland resume April 30. Friday flights from Miami are offered year round, with warm-weather fares in effect May 3.
Thursday economy class Balair round-trip tickets from New York will range from $510 to $660, depending on the dates of departure and return; if you go over and back in May, for instance, it would be $510; a later return would raise the price. Business class will cost $810 to $960. As of March 18, Pan Am's best fare to Switzerland in May is $498, which requires advance purchase. Ms. Schindelheim pointed out that as the fare wars go on through the summer, Balair would be offering its same fares, even the day before, if the seat is available.
Martinair resumes New York to Amsterdam service May 17, from Newark. This is a move from Kennedy, where Martinair operated for five years. At Martinair, seasonal West Coast flights also resume earlier, in this case service from Los Angeles, Seattle and Oakland on March 26. Toronto flights resume May 1 and Detroit flights May 10.
Not counting departure taxes and other fees, a round-trip economy ticket for a Wednesday flight from Newark between May 17 and May 31 would cost $548, and in business class it would cost $848. An economy Martinair ticket bought 21 days in advance would cost $448 for travel in this period. As of March 18, the best round-trip fare to Amsterdam in May on Pan Am would be $318. Ms. Holden said her company considered its fares competitive because demand was good and there seemed to be few seats available on the scheduled carriers at their bottom prices.
Balair and Martinair do sell directly to the public, as well as through travel agents and tour operators. Balair's number is (212) 581-3411, or, in California, Maine and Florida, (800) 322-5247. Martinair's number is (516) 365-6146. Tickets on both are sold by Travac, a tour and charter company: (800) 872-8800.

COMPLETE COLLECTED STORIES
By V.S. Pritchett.
1,232 pp. New York: Random House. $35.  
 Sir Victor Pritchett is a Victorian. Born at the end of 1900, he was given a name he dislikes because his mother expected a girl and wanted to name her for the dying Queen. In his buoyant, productive old age he can look back, across a turbulent century, on a life made coherent and satisfying by an unwavering dedication to the art and craft of writing.
Even as a young man, working in Paris or walking in Spain and continually wondering whether he would ever find anything to write about, V. S. Pritchett knew for sure he was a writer. Since then he has produced five novels, by his own admission not his best work; many distinguished volumes of travel writing; several biographies and a superb autobiography; literary criticism, of which the ninth collection, "Lasting Impressions: Essays 1961-1987," was published last year; and above all the stories, brought monumentally together in "Complete Collected Stories" as irrefutable testimony to his stature.
In "Midnight Oil," the second volume of his autobiography, Pritchett recalls the Irish writer Frank O'Connor's remark that the short story form is "natural to societies where the element of anarchy is strong and the pressure of regard for society is weak." On this view the Russians and Americans enjoyed an advantage over the English, who had to wait for "the foreign rootlessness and rawness of Kipling" before they could produce a master. But since then, he adds, they have made up for the slow start with Saki, D. H. Lawrence, Max Beerbohm and several others, the most recent being Angus Wilson. Pritchett himself belongs near or at the top of that list, and despite his devotion to the details of the English scene he is not without a certain foreignness himself. In his England, at any rate, one of the benefits of humble or provincial origin was that it offered access to what he regards as the necessary fate or privilege of the writer, which is always to be "living at the other side of a frontier."
Though deeply read in many literatures, fluent in French and Spanish and delightedly learned in less expected areas such as antiques, horticulture and the rag trade, Pritchett, like many good writers, is an autodidact. Boys of his class could hardly expect to enjoy a formal higher education early in the century. But, unlike most of them, he was enterprising enough to spend his early 20's in Paris, reading furiously while trying by all possible means to keep himself alive.
Paris was, on the whole, a keen pleasure at the time, and it also provided material for later imaginative treatment. It is, for instance, the scene of an apparently simple and rather naughty little story called "The Divers," which is really an allegory: a boy's sexual initiation liberates his imagination, and he also experiences a spontaneous overflow of narrative. It is Pritchett's belief that without a happy sexual life the mind drifts into the shallows and loses its fictive powers. Sex is the index of creativity as well as of most other good things; love is important throughout this book, up to and including some fine late stories about strange forms of sexual passion: "The Marvellous Girl" and "The Lady From Guatemala." Elsewhere Pritchett has said he has never believed people who speak of sex as productive of unhappiness.
He explains in "Midnight Oil" that his own powers were released by his second marriage, which restored that contact with his childhood he regards as essential to creative work. His own early life was dominated by a strange father who was a Christian Scientist, a small-business man, a loser. He was avaricious, intermittently oppressive and apparently as much in love with failure as with life. His antics are frequently remembered in the stories.
Children observe the amazing behavior and listen to the amazing language of adults without needing to explain them, any more than they need to explain the amazing world at large. An unimportant-looking Pritchett story called "The Night Worker" illustrates the perpetual possibility of double-entendre when children involve themselves in grown-up conversation. Later the artist may remember these clear but partial childhood observations, or at least re-create their quality of clarity and bewilderment. With the aid of such memories it becomes possible to see that through lives so shrunk, so commonplace, so weighed down by convention, by dully restrictive forms of religion, by petty vanity, there can flow great tides of emotion, lust, envy, pride. And these forces alter the contours of the individual so drastically that he or she becomes worthy of the artist's effort to specify the new shapes and distortions. The individual, caught at the moment when passion or interest transforms common clay, can never again be thought wholly commonplace.
One of the first of Pritchett's stories to become famous is "The Saint," published in the 1940's. The dull missionary of a Canadian sect called the Church of the Last Purification surprisingly takes the boy narrator punting. It happens to him, as often to others, that when punt and pole part company he stays with the pole, and after hanging for a while from a willow he falls into the river. Refusing to go back to the house and take off his wet clothes, he lies steaming in a meadow full of buttercups; when he gets up he is covered in golden pollen. This story of the alchemical transfiguration of the commonplace, the dull, even the phony -- of the lead of ordinary perception into the gold of art -- is an emblem of Pritchett's whole endeavor.
From the autobiography we learn, with a slight surprise, that he has never cared much for poetry, and he scolds himself for having used, in his early writings, far too much fancy writing and far-fetched metaphor. Fortunately he did not entirely eliminate his taste for putting a spin on sober prose, giving it a sudden glory. In "The Chestnut Tree" a woman enters an all-male office: "She looked at us tenderly and without innocence. She was as hard as a bird. When she spoke her voice was like a high cross voice in a garden." That story belongs to the 1940's, as does "It May Never Happen," which contains this description: "a stringy and dejected man, bald but not sufficiently so, with pince-nez like a dismal pair of birds on either side of his nose, and a grey moustache, damp with tea." Here the spin is imparted not so much by the dismal birds as by the surprising concept of insufficient baldness. A few years later, in "The Snag," there is this portrait of a widower: "Fresher and even younger after grief, he now wore a blatant black, red and green jacket in wide check. A blue and white check open shirt seemed to boil on his chest and a few chest hairs showed like a whiff of steam at the neck."
Comparable excesses may be found, only a little less often, only a little more regulated, in later work: "a dark, prompt electric black moustache, like a too recent political decision," for example. Or "He was standing lost, as puzzled as a bust by what was going on around him." Or "the sainted upward gaze of the blind" -- this from a great story called "Blind Love," a perfectly tempered, untragic account of an affair between a blind man and a disfigured woman.
There are countless felicities of this sort; they transfigure narratives of all lengths and kinds. They illustrate the strangeness of the ordinary. Of course the success of the illustration depends on the prior success of the representation of the ordinary. Pritchett has a sedulously trained ear for ordinary dialogue; or, better, he has the power to write what sounds like flat ordinariness on the point of flowering into disconcerting strangeness -- a Dickensian quality, though Pritchett's manner is entirely his own. It is found not only in the big stories but also in less ambitious efforts, such as a story about two genteel, increasingly drunken women discussing fleas and love in an empty pub ("Things as They Are") or in a small, comic, unambitious sketch of a nervously talkative dentist ("The Oedipus Complex").
In his autobiography Pritchett records a conversation with H. G. Wells in which they considered the question of whether lower-class characters could ever be treated in other than comic terms. Wells, on reflection, thought not, but Pritchett, as you would expect, disagreed. In Wells's fiction there are suburban little people, like Alfred Polly in "The Adventures of Mr. Polly," who achieve peculiar escapes into happiness; in Pritchett stories escapes and happinesses, whoever has them, rich or poor -- and not all his people are lower-class -- usually stay within the limits of everyday life. As for the child, the amazing is already there in the ordinary.
Pritchett writes at all lengths, on many topics and from various impulses. "The Necklace" is a story he wrote to meet a challenge from the past, Guy de Maupassant and Henry James having written about necklaces of disputed ownership. Another story he wrote under a title consisting of words used by his father on his deathbed ("Just a Little More"). A tale of bankruptcy exists because he was fascinated by his father's explanation of the relevant law (the bailiffs can't take your desk and chair away). Others were written because he knew about and delighted in the specialized avarice of antique dealers and collectors, or because he saw a Jamesian opportunity in the fancy that a man, having sold his house, might continue intermittently and absent-mindedly to use it, eventually ousting the new owner (but not the owner's wife). He wrote "The Speech" in response to a self-imposed technical challenge: imagine a woman making a competent public speech while thinking at the same time of quite different things.
Occasionally, because the possibilities were not exhausted at once, he would string two or three stories together, sometimes successfully, sometimes less so (though when I think this about a Pritchett story I remind myself of his intense self-criticism, his endless revisions, and at once begin to wonder where I have gone wrong).
Diverse though the stories are in theme and amplitude, it may well be that Pritchett is at his most brilliantly assured when he allows himself some length, as in "When My Girl Comes Home," a long story that I am glad to say he, like me, regards as probably his finest. The girl is Hilda, one of his many raffish or flighty women. She left her home in England to marry an Indian doctor and later a Japanese man who protected her throughout World War II. But the press, having got hold of a story that she had been in a prison camp ("Four Years in Japanese Torture Camp," the newspaper headline said), turns up at her homecoming celebration and the truth emerges. Hilda's commonplace family discovers, and is amazed by, her marriage to a Japanese enemy. The accuracy with which their reactions are recorded is comic, certainly, and almost cruel, yet the ordinariness, the meanness of these lives is illuminated by a kind of poetry. They are observed by a narrator who stands slightly apart; a child's clarity of vision is given a slightly corrupt knowingness in the telling.
Though there are early stories that were not included in this collection, it is complete in the sense that it consists of all the author wants to preserve. These 82 tales provide, in addition to their intrinsic beauty, a series of rich allusions to the condition of England from the 30's to the 90's. For example, you can see inflation at work in the money values, and the changing cultural surfaces in the alterations of manners. But under all the changes there obstinately prevail, demanding celebration, the continuities of human passion. The skills and the interests of the observer may alter with time, but there remain, still to be observed, the ambitious, the odious, the bullying, the charming, the flirtatious, pursuing life and happiness however they happen to apprehend them. Commonplace people going through their domestic routines have only to be described to seem comic or tedious, until one realizes that they suffer the passions of the great, that their lives can be seen to be penetrated by despair and exaltation. There is a clinical quality about Pritchett's observation, but its purpose is nevertheless the celebration of life. If it is true that England had to grow disorderly before it could have a great story writer, this volume suggests the sacrifice may have been worth it.
 
 
 
'HOW DID I DO THAT?'
 LONDON -- "Terrifically heavy, isn't it?" V. S. Pritchett said, leafing through the thick volume that holds a lifetime's worth of his short stories. Sitting in the cozy upstairs living room of his northwest London home recently, he explained that, at the age of 90, he has forgotten some of the tales. "When I read one, I think, 'How did I do that?' " Then he moved his finger down the table of contents, and it was clear that he remembered precisely how.
"I was about 25 when I wrote this," he said, pointing to "Sense of Humor," the first of his stories published. He had trouble with it, he recalled, because he wanted to portray his protagonist as a dull man. Instead, he wrote a dull story. "I sent it out, and back it came. Then I thought, 'I know what's wrong, I should be him.' " Sure enough, he said, the story worked once he altered the point of view "and became the most boring man on earth."
This emphasis on stepping away from oneself was a crucial lesson for a young writer. "For example, it's very important to feel foreign. I was born in England, but when I'm being a writer, everyone in England is foreign to me." He added that he discovered how to step away from truth, too, or at least facts. Many of his stories are based on real events -- he even paused to tell what inspired "The Sailor" and "The Lady From Guatemala" -- but for a tale to succeed, "it must become imaginary; it makes it more real."
His stories improved over the years, he said, as he let the characters tell more of the tale in their own words. "I think I tended to overwrite at the beginning. I used more adjectives and long descriptive passages. It was more 'glorious' than need be."
Words and phrases have fascinated him since childhood. Some of his stories take simple expressions as their starting point. "I learned a lot from the Irish -- the people and the writers," he said. "I went to Ireland as a reporter and found it was their talk that would tell the story, not the prose-ing of the writer."
He isn't writing much himself these days, "but I still listen, in the hope of hearing a strange phrase. And I still have five or six 'lame ducks' on my desk that I'd like to finish." -- DEBORAH STEAD

Hunting Elephants Around The World

BYLINE: BY BILL BANCROFT; Bill Bancroft is a Dallas-based business writer.

 BODY:
RAY HUNT REMEMBERS THE MOMENT clearly. It was just past 7 o'clock on the night of Jan. 16, and the 47-year-old president of the Hunt Oil Company was in his new, twin-engine Canadair Challenger jet over Nashville and bound for Washington. Suddenly, the pilot, Jim Wilson, called him to the cockpit. Wilson had just spoken to the Nashville airport. "Ray," he said, "the ground controllers are saying that the bombing's started in Iraq."
Hunt reached for the telephone and confirmed the report with his headquarters staff in Dallas. Then Hunt ordered Wilson to turn the jet around and head for home. 
 Ray Hunt has a lot at stake in the Middle East. Back in 1984, a wildcat well drilled by Hunt Oil uncovered a giant field in central Yemen near the Saudi Arabian border, and the company is still a major presence in the country, with 220 employees and oil production worth $100 million in revenue last year. After Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August, Ray Hunt had ordered the dependents of his American employees evacuated: Yemen had allied itself with Saddam Hussein. Hunt and his top aides had also drawn up plans for every contingency, from anti-American riots to outright battle in the oilfields. There was no obvious reason for Hunt to return to his headquarters the night the bombing began.
"It was a gut, emotional thing," he explained a week later. "I don't want to be pompous about it but, in a storm, the captain ought to be on the bridge."
Ray Hunt is not pompous, but he is earnest, wholesome and monogamous -- qualities for which his father, the late H. L., once the richest man in America, was not noted. H. L. was self-involved and eccentric; Ray is Dallas's unofficial First Citizen, mainstream all the way. There are, however, certain physical resemblances: chunky build, high forehead, full cheeks, blue eyes. And, in his quiet way, the son has matched the father's willingness to take big risks and his iron determination to come out on top. Says Jack Knox, a college friend and C.E.O. of Sixx Holdings, a Dallas investment company: "Ray's an achievement freak."
After taking over the family business in 1975, Hunt increased its annual revenue by more than 300 percent, to $750 million by 1990. He did it largely by betting millions on overseas oil exploration, at a time when other independents -- exploration companies unaffiliated with the majors, such as Exxon -- were sticking close to home. Along the way he has taken part in the discovery of three "elephants," oil-patch lingo for those rarely found fields that hold at least 100 million barrels of petroleum.
Hunt Oil is not America's largest independent -- that title goes to the Oryx Energy Company of Dallas -- though it is among the top half dozen. It operates in 11 states, and encompasses oil pipelines, a refinery and service stations, not to mention a cattle ranch and a vegetable farm. Unlike so many independents, Hunt can finance its own exploration operations, with no help from the majors. What's more, Hunt is privately owned, free to pursue higher-risk, longer-term investments that shareholders of a publicly traded company might not tolerate.
For most independents, the last five years have been the worst of times. The vast majority are small operators with a handful of employees. As was true a century ago, they drill most of the nation's wells -- over 32,000 of them last year -- and often leave development of the fields to the majors. But in 1986 they were dealt a double blow. The Tax Reform Act disposed of the favorable tax treatment that had traditionally attracted capital to oil exploration, and the price of oil plunged to $10 a barrel. The result has been what Ray Hunt calls "a fundamental restructuring," with thousands of mergers, takeovers and bankruptcies. The ranks have thinned from more than 11,000 in 1985 to about 5,500 in 1990.
Discouraged about prospects for finding more oil in a country that has been pawed over by generations of wildcatters, and attracted by the favorable terms offered by undeveloped nations, growing numbers of the bigger independents have turned their attention overseas. One survey predicts that their exploration investments abroad will rise this year by 15 percent. Ray Hunt's focus is still on foreign prospects, but -- ever the contrarian -- he is putting increased emphasis on exploration in the United States. Previous drillers, he believes, have overlooked major fields that modern technologies can uncover.
The ability to recognize an opportunity and then bet the bank was one of H. L. Hunt's trademarks and, among other things, it made him a great poker player. So is his son, but with a difference. Friends tell of his sitting at the table after a game, with piles of money around him, wearing an unhappy expression. "After he wins," says Tom Meurer, Hunt's senior vice president for administration, "he feels guilty." Still, in poker as in oil, Ray Hunt never deals a hand he does not intend to win.
 HUNT OIL'S headquarters occupies eight floors of a glass-and-steel skyscraper whose nose-cone peak gives it the look of a rocket ship. The offices are home to a brigade of geophysicists, petroleum engineers, lease negotiators, lawyers and all the other specialists of the modern oil-exploration business. Outside Ray Hunt's office a portrait of his father stares benevolently down at visitors.
"Ray doesn't have the idiosyncrasies his daddy had," says 81-year-old Michel T. Halbouty, a Houston wildcatter who sank his first well in 1935 and remains active in the oil business. "Ray is a sophisticated, well-trained oilman, where his father learned by the seat of his pants."
When H. L., a failed cotton planter and trader, got into the oil business in the 1920's, a handshake served as a drilling contract and a wildcatter relied on creekology to find oil. The principle was simple. Petroleum is typically found in porous stone, trapped under pressure beneath layers of harder, impermeable rock. The terrain of creek beds sometimes indicates such formations. The creekologist would also keep an eye peeled for oil seeps, gas bubbles or other signs of oil. In practice, however, creekology often amounted to little more than a wildcatter's striding up to the bank of a creek and announcing, "What the hell, let's drill one here."
During the 1920's, H. L. Hunt relied on hunches and grub stakes raised at the poker table to achieve modest success as an oilman in Arkansas and Louisiana. His historic moment came in 1930, when a septuagenarian wildcatter, Columbus "Dad" Joiner, drilled a promising well in East Texas. Hunt secretly employed an oil scout to monitor test results at another wildcat well in the area and, before Joiner realized the full extent of the discovery, H. L. persuaded Joiner to sell his entire 5,000 acres of leases. The price: $30,000 and the promise of up to $1.3 million from any resulting oil.
As it turned out, Hunt had purchased rights to some of the richest ground in the elephantine East Texas oilfield -- the largest single oil deposit ever found in the continental United States. For Hunt, the field was the path to a personal fortune worth, by some estimates, $2 billion.
Hunt, a notorious philanderer, had six children by his first wife, Lyda. After her death he formally acknowledged the existence of a second family by marrying Ruth Eileen Ray, a former Hunt Oil secretary, and adopting their 14-year-old son, Ray, and his three sisters. The "second family," as it is known in Dallas, had lived in a modest one-story house a two-minute drive from H. L.'s mansion, which was named after and modeled on George Washington's Mount Vernon.
Following their marriage, H. L. moved Ruth and her children out of the bungalow and into the big house. Ray's older half-siblings -- Margaret, H. L. Jr., Caroline, Herbert, Bunker and Lamar -- were adults, with trust funds of their own. The two families have never been close.
Ray began working summers at Hunt Oil when he was in the eighth grade, accompanying his father's "land men" as they negotiated oil leases with ranchers and farmers. He joined the company full-time in 1965 after graduating from Southern Methodist University, where he majored in economics. He had served in the student senate, been elected president of the Phi Delta Theta chapter and named "outstanding business student."
In the years before H. L. Hunt's death in November 1974, the company seemed to be drifting. Herbert and Bunker nominally ran Hunt Oil, but they increasingly concentrated on their own ventures. It was Ray who had the office adjacent to the patriarch's -- the only office with a door directly into H. L.'s sanctum.
Ray Hunt was named executor of his father's estate, and his mother inherited all of H. L.'s stock in Hunt Oil. After considerable wrangling, Ray bought out the first family's stake in the company. "The common perception is that this was all laid out for me on a platter," he says of his oil empire. "But the family situation was such that it wasn't."
IT WAS A FEW DAYS after Christmas, and Robert Garrett, Hunt Oil's chief geophysicist, was giving Ray Hunt and a handful of his top executives a spirited briefing on the state of the company's operations in Guyana. The walls of the headquarters conference room were covered with giant maps of thousands of acres of South American jungle that Hunt Oil had been studying for several months.
The company obtained exploration rights to the property after a Canadian competitor had actually found some oil but then withdrawn, convinced that the site held no commercial potential. Hunt and his people thought the Canadians had simply given up too soon.
Hunt Oil's basic exploration tack is seismic. A dynamite charge is set off, sending shock waves down into the earth to bounce off the various rock strata. Back on the surface, a geophone records the shock-wave reflections on magnetic tape, which a computer translates into a cross-section of the rock layers below the site. Geophysicists like Garrett can study these cross-sections for signs of traps where oil might be located.
"Bob, were there any surprises?" Hunt asked. By all accounts, he is a good listener, unlike his autocratic father.
Garrett shook his head. "Everything is going pretty much as we expected," he said. Better, in fact: the testing was a year ahead of schedule, thanks in part to the $50,000 satellite telephones the fieldworkers have been using to send voice and fax updates to Dallas. In years past, it might have taken several days to truck a batch of test data over dirt roads to the capital city, Georgetown, so it could be shipped back to the States by airplane. With the new electronic links, Hunt's headquarters staff has been able to analyze the test results quickly and then direct the seismic crews to the more promising sites.
Ray Hunt relies on briefings like this one to keep tabs on his global expeditionary forces. A prolific writer of memos, he always carries a small note
book where he jots down his ideas. And wherever his senior managers are, on Sunday nights they can count on hearing from Hunt, by fax or car phone if necessary, as he prepares for the coming week. Though he prides himself on giving aides great latitude to do their jobs, his fingerprints are all over major decisions.
In oil-patch parlance, to "spud" a well is to commence drilling. Hunt, who is all too familiar with the odds against wildcat wells -- 5-to-1 in the United States -- is fond of telling his staff, "Every single time you spud a well, it's probably going to be a dry hole." But even poker-faced Ray Hunt must be pleased with the conclusions of Bob Garrett's briefing: the seismic data from Guyana point to several potential traps that could be hiding large reservoirs of oil.
RAY HUNT'S FATHER never drilled overseas. But by the beginning of 1976, Ray was starting to think international. The overseas potential seemed endless, though exploration there was dominated by the majors. As it happened, his decision to leap was the result of pure serendipity.
One day, representatives of the Sabine Corporation, a small Dallas-based oil company, came calling at the business offices Ray still shared with his half-brothers. Sabine was looking to sell its 15 percent stake in a British North Sea exploration led by Mesa Petroleum. It had come to pitch the offer, with an asking price of $50,000, to Bunker Hunt. But Bunker was out, so the brokers dropped by Ray's office. He snapped it up.
The Beatrice Field in the North Sea became Ray Hunt's version of the Dad Joiner deal -- an elephant of 150 million barrels. As oil prices escalated in the 70's, the value of Hunt Oil's stake grew to more than $500 million. "We were in the club now," Hunt says, savoring the memory. "It allowed us the vehicle to quickly establish ourselves in the international arena."
By 1980 the company's lease acreage overseas had reached 21.9 million, including interests in Australia, Portugal and South Korea. Hunt was flirting with the Chinese, hoping to obtain offshore leases in the South China Sea, though he eventually broke off talks after failing to reach agreement on price.
Hunt's strategy was, and is, carefully calculated to allow for the risky niche he has chosen -- to look for oil in less developed, often politically volatile nations. He bases his potential return on the assumption of $15-a-barrel oil, and he is prepared to lose all the money he puts into any given exploration -- provided that there is a chance of finding a very large field. "It's a mistake to do low-risk, low-reward kinds of plays," he says.
Hunt has had his share of losing bets, hitting dry holes in Argentina, Jordan and South Korea, among other countries. But he has stayed with his strategy because it is tailored to Hunt Oil's competitive circumstances. The majors, with their financial clout and vertical integration -- from oil well to gasoline pump -- have a lot to offer a foreign nation looking to develop its resources. On the other hand, the majors have high overheads and, as publicly owned companies, low tolerance for speculative searches in politically risky third-world countries.
The big companies have another disadvantage, according to John Lichtblau, chairman of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation in New York. "In some cases a government may not want to work with a major for image reasons," Lichtblau says. "They're considered part of a Western monopoly."
Hunt Oil, by contrast, is a lean organization, able to make quick decisions and move fast. And its corporate culture is very different from that of the faceless behemoths. To emphasize his company's affability, Ray Hunt will invite potential foreign clients home for dinner with Mom. Last year, Ali Abdullah Saleh, the President of Yemen, was the guest of honor at a 46-person banquet at Mount Vernon. Ray's mother presented Saleh with a porcelain Yellow Rose of Texas, and the after-dinner entertainment was a Mississippi Delta banjo band. Folksiness aside, such occasions are intended to demonstrate that the Hunts have deep enough pockets to live up to their contracts.
To sort out the political and cultural conditions in a target country, Hunt Oil retains high-level consultants like former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. Other friends in high places include one of the Bush Administration's lead emissaries to the Middle East, Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger, and Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, the American military commander in the Persian Gulf. Eagleburger and Schwarzkopf have both been guests on Hunt's annual bonefishing excursion off Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula.
Hanging in Hunt's office is an autographed photo of a notable one-time Texas wildcatter, George Bush. The picture was taken when the then-Vice President helped dedicate Hunt Oil's Yemen refinery in 1986. They have been friends since Hunt worked on Bush's unsuccessful 1972 Senate campaign, and they get together as their schedules allow. When the President was in Dallas last fall, for example, the two men had a half-hour meeting.
What do Hunt and the President talk about at such sessions? "Anything he wants to talk about," says Hunt.
 IN THE MID-80'S, A DECADE after the end of the Vietnam War, the political climate seemed to be changing in Indochina, and Hunt Oil began thinking about Laos. "When we go into a country, we know a lot," says Tom Meurer, 49, one of Hunt's top negotiators. "We don't just crap shoot."
For Marilyn J. Odell, a Hunt researcher, the assignment was "like 'Mission Impossible' " -- find written evidence of the existence of petroleum in Laos without revealing Hunt Oil's interest. Odell started in the musty, cavelike basement of the Societe Geologique de France in central Paris, where field reports from the former French colony were stored. She found hints that oil might lie beneath the Savannakhet region of southern Laos. She also tracked down "the one person still alive who had done a lot of field work in Laos" -- Dr. Henri Fontaine, a paleontologist and Roman Catholic priest. He told her that an exploration team had drilled a well in the country during World War II, but that it had been abandoned after a Japanese raid.
In 1986, Meurer visited the Laotian capital of Vientiane, where he was received with some suspicion by a deputy foreign minister: why would an American company want to look for oil there when the price -- $10 a barrel -- was so low? Laos was not yet ready to deal.
But Meurer was a persistent suitor. Laotian Foreign Vice-Minister Soubanh Srithirat came to New York the following year for the United Nations General Assembly session, and Meurer persuaded him to come down to Texas afterward for a day of fishing at Hunt's Circle K ranch outside Dallas.
Last year, Meurer's persistence paid off. Hunt Oil received exploration rights to more than seven million acres in southern Laos. The company will not disclose the details of this "production sharing" agreement, but such deals generally work this way: In return for a percentage of any resulting oil production, the exploration company agrees to conduct geological and geophysical tests, followed by the drilling of a specific number of wells. The contract typically spells out how the exploration company is allowed to proceed, depending on the testing and drilling results.
In the case of Yemen, Hunt Oil's inspiration arrived in the person of a Syrian oil consultant, Moujib al Malazi, who visited Ian Maycock, chief geologist in the company's London office, in the fall of 1980. Malazi reported that the World Bank had funded a study of the Yemeni mountains the previous year, looking for gold, silver and other minerals. The aerial readings of the earth's magnetic field had turned up evidence of formations that might contain oil-bearing rock.
Within a few months, Maycock and Malazi, along with Tom Meurer, were in Yemen and walking parts of the basin near the ancient city of Ma'rib. They liked what they saw.
The agreement giving Hunt Oil drilling rights to 3.1 million acres was signed in September 1981. True to form, Ray Hunt left most of the bargaining to his team of legal specialists. He did not even go to Yemen himself until 1983, when the company was far along with its seismic testing and nearly ready to select its first drilling site.
Hunt Oil spudded that well, the Alif No. 1, about 35 miles outside Ma'rib. The initial results looked promising, and in February 1984 a South Korean consortium purchased 24.5 percent of Hunt's production-sharing agreement. The price was never disclosed, but it was enough to cover half of Hunt's exploration costs, the company says. Four months later, the well tests showed a potential flow rate of 7,800 barrels per day. (The initial flow from the Dad Joiner's East Texas discovery well had been 6,800 barrels a day.) Yemen had joined the Arab oil club with a field that held an estimated 600 million barrels.
FOR RAY HUNT AND his team, however, the real celebration occurred 17 months later, when Hunt struck what may have been the deal of his life. As an independent, Hunt did not have the capital resources to develop the Ma'rib fields -- to build the necessary pipelines, refinery and other support systems to get the oil to market. He invited 11 companies to discuss that task, and finally decided to talk in earnest with Exxon.
In fact, despite his customary reluctance to play negotiator, he took charge of the bargaining, which involved several all-nighters. "When you get to the point where you're trading elephants," says Tom Meurer, "you can bet your bottom dollar that Ray Hunt is going to be right in the middle of it."
The deal he cut with Exxon for 49 percent of Hunt Oil's stake was worth $1 billion -- half in cash for Hunt, the other half committed to the construction of a refinery and a 260-mile pipeline from Ma'rib to the Red Sea port of Ras Isa. Hunt Oil operates the facilities, which eventually will become the property of the Yemeni government.
Ray Hunt notes that Exxon's offer was not the highest, that he went for it because he wanted to clinch the deal quickly and because he felt that Exxon would make the best long-term partner. "We have a reputation for never squeezing the last nickel out of a deal," Hunt says. "My grandmother had an expression: 'Pigs get fat and hogs get slaughtered.' "
The agreement with Exxon still had to be approved by the Yemeni Government. In December 1985 Hunt embarked upon several long days of bargaining in the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, where he made the mistake of leaving his contact lenses in too long. By the time he arrived back at the Dallas-Fort Worth airport, Yemeni approval in hand, his eyes were so irritated that he could not see. He spent Christmas and New Year's wearing patches over both eyes.
There is another version of the Yemen oil story, told by wildcatter Jack Crichton, chairman of the Dallas-based Arabian Shield Development Company. Crichton charges that Arabian Shield reached a tentative exploration agreement with a Yemeni oil minister in February 1981 -- seven months before Hunt Oil and the Yemeni Government signed a deal. "Our allegation is that we would have been awarded the contract if it had not been for the interference of the Hunt people," says Crichton, who has sued Ray Hunt and Hunt Oil and is waiting for his day in court before detailing his charges.
A Texas court summarily dismissed the case in 1988, and late last month an appeal was pending. Yemen's Government has denied Arabian Shield's claim, and Ray Hunt, in a rare display of anger, describes the suit as "a bunch of garbage." He adds, "It's a shakedown, and they're shaking down the wrong people."
THE FIRST CLEAR INDICATION of Ray Hunt's contrarian business style came not in oil but in real estate. That was in 1970 when he bought a 20-acre site on the wrong side of the tracks from Dallas's Union Station train terminal. "The conventional wisdom was that downtown was dying," Hunt recalls. But eventually, out of negotiations between Hunt and city officials, there emerged the Reunion project -- a 50-acre downtown development that included renovation of the train terminal and construction of a new sports arena. Hunt put up a Hyatt Regency hotel and a 600-foot tower with a revolving restaurant on top, a kind of giant dandelion that has become a signature building on the city's skyline.
Hunt is generally conceded to be the city's most powerful single resident. Despite a population of more than one million, Dallas has traditionally had the power structure of a small town, dominated by a dozen or two leading business and professional people. Ray Hunt makes his voice heard. Currently, his most visible post is chairman of the Southern Methodist University board of trustees.
Asked about his No. 1 ranking in "D" magazine's "most powerful" list, Hunt visibly squirms. "People's reputations are like their shadows," he says. "They are longer or shorter than they should be. Right now, mine is longer." Hunt also shuns ostentation: he drives a Buick, and he and his wife, Nancy, have sent their five children to public schools.
Those who know Ray Hunt best say it is his mother's influence that explains his civic works, his straight-arrow manner, his refusal to put on airs. The contrast between Ray and his half-brothers, Herbert and Bunker, has long been a staple of Dallas conversation. The most dramatic example came in 1980 with his half-brothers' failed effort to corner the silver market, after which each was fined $10 million by the Government and banned from commodities trading. In 1988, Herbert and Bunker's Penrod Drilling Company went into Chapter 11, and was eventually taken over by their creditors, including the Fort Worth investor, Richard E. Rainwater.
In fact, Rainwater seems to be making a habit of picking up Hunt properties. In the early 80's Ray Hunt built the 40-story, million-square-foot Continental Plaza office tower in downtown Fort Worth for an estimated $90 million. When depressed oil prices threw the region into a recession, Hunt had trouble finding tenants and keeping those he had; last year Rainwater took the property off Hunt's hands at the fire-sale price of $64 million.
Real estate, of course, is pretty much a sideline for Hunt, but the odds may be catching up with him even in the oil side of his business. He has failed to find another elephant since his Yemen trophy. The results from Laos and Guyana are not yet in. In Chile, after one dry hole last June, the company is exploring a block high up on the Altiplano de Arica, a mountainous moonscape near the borders with Bolivia and Peru; no oil hunters before Hunt have thought the Altiplano worth drilling.
Meanwhile, he is devoting more time and money to domestic exploration. In the face of conventional geological wisdom, he says he firmly believes there are giant natural-gas fields -- true elephants -- that were missed by earlier generations of wildcatters. It would somehow be fitting if H. L.'s boy, the consummate contrarian, were to make his next big find back home.
One afternoon last January found him aloft in his Canadair Challenger, five miles above cloud-covered East Texas. "It's this shaded area," he said, hunched over a map, pointing toward a section of land near the small Cajun town of Jennings, La., the jet's destination. His company had just started a new well on the site.
Hunt was hoping, he said, to uncover a field holding 114 billion cubic feet of natural gas -- the equivalent of 20 million barrels of oil. Not an elephant this time, maybe, but a cash cow worth milking, all the same. He looked up and allowed himself the smallest of smiles. "It would be a real good discovery."

HEADLINE: Albert McKinley Rains, 89, Dies; Backed Housing Bills in Congress

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON

 BODY:
Former Representative Albert McKinley Rains of Alabama, who left his imprint on much of the housing legislation enacted in his two decades on Capitol Hill, died Friday at Holy Name of Jesus Medical Center in Gadsden, Ala. He was 89 years old.
Mr. Rains, a Democrat, was first elected to Congress from Alabama's Fifth Congressional District in 1944 and rose to the chairmanship of the housing subcommittee of the House Banking and Currency Committee. While he was one of the foremost champions in Congress of more and better public housing, his legislative interests also extended to agriculture, Social Security and foreign aid. 
 He was the author or co-author of much of the housing legislation enacted after World War II, including expansion of Federal programs in public housing and urban renewal, military and veterans' housing, college dormitory construction, housing for the elderly and assistance to families trying to own a home of their own.
 
Switch From Teaching to Law

Mr. Rains, a native of Groveoak in De Kalb County, in northeastern Alabama, attended public schools before graduating from State Teachers College in Jacksonville, Ala., and the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa. He became a high school teacher, but soon found that his main interest was the law.
He was admitted to the bar in 1928, and became one of his state's most prominent lawyers as a member of the firm of Rains & Rains in Gadsden. He also served as deputy solicitor for Etowah County and, from 1935 to 1944, as Gadsden's city attorney. 
Mr. Rains was elected to the Alabama Legislature in 1942, won the Democratic nomination for Congress in 1944 and ran unopposed that November. He went on to serve in the 89th Congress and nine succeeding Congresses. He left the House in January 1965.
After his Congressional service, Mr. Rains returned to the practice of law in Gadsden. He also was chairman of the First City National Bank in that city, and was the author of a book, "With a Heritage So Rich."
Mr. Rains is survived by his wife of 51 years, the former Allison Blair, and a sister, Magnolia Michaels of Talladega, Ala.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR;
Naming of Hamadi, a Shiite, May Aim at Placating Rebels

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: NICOSIA, Cyprus, March 23

 BODY:
The appointment of Saadun Hamadi, a Shiite Muslim from the holy city of Karbala, as Prime Minister of Iraq is seen as an attempt to placate the rebellious Shiite majority in the south.
Despite his Shiite background and some indications that he advocates change, Mr. Hamadi has been one of President Saddam Hussein's closest associates for decades, and has been among the handful of ranking Iraqis who have survived Mr. Saddam's periodic deadly purges. 
 It was not immediately clear just how much political power he would have in his new post. It seemed highly possible that he would be merely a figurehead under Mr. Hussein's control.
It was also uncertain whether Mr. Hamadi, who is in his mid-50's, would be acceptable to the Shiite and Kurdish rebels and whether the political changes promised by Mr. Hussein would be enough to end the revolts.
As Deputy Prime Minister during the 1980-88 war with Iran, Mr. Hamadi gingerly advocated a compromise with Teheran.
He was a major figure in shaping Iraq's postwar economy as president of the ruling Baath Arab Socialist party's economic committee.
He was a major advocate of the tentative political and economic liberalization process endorsed last year by Mr. Hussein but held up after the crisis over Kuwait.
 
Won Doctorate in U.S.
 Mr. Hamadi was one of the founding members of the Baath party in the 1950's, when it was an underground movement seeking to topple the monarchy.
After completing undergraduate studies at the American University of Beirut, he left for the United States in the 1950's, where he obtained a doctorate in economics.
He returned home after the Iraqi monarchy was overthrown, became editor of Al Jumhuriya, the Baath newspaper, and climbed swiftly into the upper echelon of the party.
He was appointed Oil Minister in 1968 and Foreign Minister in 1974. In 1984 he was elected to the Revolutionary Command Council, which rules the country.
During the war over Kuwait, Mr. Hamadi shuttled to several Arab capitals to garner support for Mr. Hussein.

HEADLINE: Dave Guard, 56, Founding Figure of Kingston Trio and Folk Revival

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: CONCORD, N.H., March 23

 BODY:
Dave Guard, founder of the Kingston Trio, which brought folk music from the coffee houses to mainstream America with songs like the haunting "Tom Dooley" and the rollicking "MTA," died Friday at his home in Rollinsford. He was 56 years old.
His daughter, Sally Guard of New York, said today that he died of lymphoma. 
 A native of Honolulu, Mr. Guard graduated from Stanford University in 1956 with a degree in economics. A year later he got together with two students at Menlo College, in Palo Alto, Calif., Bob Shane and Nick Reynolds, and founded the Kingston Trio, whose hit songs helped create the folk music boom of the 1950's and 60's.
Reached by telephone in Coronado, Calif., Mr. Reynolds recalled that the three originally got together to sing for fun.
"We then started singing for beers," Mr. Reynolds said.
 
'Ivy League and Calypso'

In an interview with Life magazine in 1959, Mr. Guard said the three chose the name Kingston because they wanted "a name for the group that would be Ivy League and calypso."
As the group grew more popular on college campuses in the Bay Area, it began to sing in legendary San Francisco musical meccas of the era like "The Purple Onion" and "The Hungry i."
"That's when our career took off," Mr. Reynolds said.
In 1959, before the folk category was established, the group won a Grammy for the best country and western recording for "Tom Dooley," the group's best-selling single.
The next year,the group won the first Grammy for the best folk album.
The original trio had nine gold albums, with "The Kingston Trio at the Hungry i," its most successful.
Among the group's hits were "The MTA," "Where Have All the Flowers Gone?" and "Scotch and Soda."
Mr. Reynolds, who with Bob Shane has remained with the group, said the period when the original Kingston Trio was performing, from 1957 to 1961, when Mr. Guard left the group, "was the highlight of our careers."
After leaving the group, Mr. Guard started the Whiskyhill Singers and moved to Australia, where he lived until 1968 and was host of a television show. Mr. Guard also wrote several books, including a manual on guitar technique as well as books of fairy tales.
He is survived by his mother, Marjorie, of Honolulu; two daughters, Ms. Guard of New York and Catherine Shinneman of Los Angeles, and a son, Tom of San Francisco.

HEADLINE: Harvard Finds a Replacement for Its President

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass., March 23

 BODY:
Neil L. Rudenstine, a 56-year-old scholar of Renaissance literature who is former provost of Princeton University, has been offered the presidency of Harvard University by the committee seeking a candidate to succeed Derek C. Bok.
Friends and associates of Mr. Rudenstine, who is now executive vice president of the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, said he was expected to meet with Harvard's Board of Overseers on Sunday at a hastily called gathering in New York. At the meeting, the overseers are to appraise Mr. Rudenstine and he is to signal whether he will accept the job, his colleagues said. 
 The overseers, one of Harvard's two governing bodies, are then to vote on the nomination at their next regular meeting in early April. The members of the other governing body, the Harvard Corporation, make up most of the search committee and have already interviewed Mr. Rudenstine at length.
Mr. Bok will retire in June after 20 years as president.
Mr. Rudenstine, who has homes in Manhattan and Princeton, did not return telephone calls seeking comment today. Harvard officials reached by telephone refused to comment.
 
One of Four Finalists
 Mr. Rudenstine had been reported to be one of four finalists for the presidency. The others were Martin S. Feldstein, a professor of economics at Harvard and a former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers; Philip Leder, a prominent geneticist at the Harvard Medical School, and Gerhard Casper, the provost of the University of Chicago. Earlier this month, when the selection committee was reported to be having trouble choosing the next president, Henry Rosovsky, the dean of the faculty of arts and sciences at Harvard and a member of the search committee, was said to be a possible compromise candidate.
The choice of Mr. Rudenstine, first reported by The Harvard Crimson on Friday, would be somewhat unusual. He did not graduate from Harvard, though he received his Ph.D. there, and he has not taught there since 1968.
He graduated summa cum laude from Princeton in 1956 and then spent three years at Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar before his doctoral studies in English literature at Harvard. He taught Renaissance literature at Harvard from 1964 to 1968 before returning to Princeton as a professor of English. There he rose rapidly through the ranks as an administrator, holding the posts of dean of students, dean of the college and then provost, Princeton's No. 2 job, for 10 years. He still teaches a popular freshman class on Shakespeare at Princeton.
He was widely regarded as the logical successor to William G. Bowen, Princeton's president, when Mr. Bowen resigned in 1987 to become head of the Mellon Foundation, which concentrates on educational programs and, with assets of more than $1.8 billion at the end of 1989, is one of the nation's 10 wealthiest foundations. But Mr. Rudenstine surprised his colleagues when he elected to accompany Mr. Bowen to the Mellon Foundation.
 
'Knack for Leading'
 Friends say Mr. Rudenstine is a gentle, thoughtful man, and Princeton officials highly praised him today.
"I've known Neil since he was an undergraduate, and I just think enormously highly of him," said Robert F. Goheen, the president of Princeton from 1957 to 1972.
Carl Wartenburg, who was an assistant to Mr. Bowen when he was president and now is assistant to Princeton's current president, Harold T. Shapiro, said: "Neil would have been a very popular choice for president here. He is a man of great integrity and wisdom, who has a knack for leading without making you feel he has taken the initiative away from you."
Eugene Y. Lowe Jr., Princeton's dean of students, said that when Mr. Rudenstine came to Princeton in 1968 there were 3,200 male undergraduates. "When he left the place in 1988, it was coed and much more diverse," Dr. Lowe said. "During those 20 years, you could say Princeton transformed itself, and Neil was in the middle of it all."
Dr. Lowe and others at Princeton said Mr. Rudenstine has several qualities that Harvard is especially interested in, given its current needs. Harvard, for example, is about to begin a $2 billion fund-raising drive, the largest capital campaign ever by the university, and Mr. Rudenstine had helped oversee a highly successful $400 million fund-raising drive at Princeton. Moreover, Dr. Lowe said, Mr. Rudenstine proved to be a tough budget administrator, another quality Harvard needs as it faces a serious budget shortfall.
Mr. Rudenstine's wife, Angelica Zander Rudenstine, whom he met while a Rhodes Scholar in Britain, is an art historian and currator. She is currently chairwoman of the supervisory committee for Harvard's department of fine arts. The Rudenstines have three children, one of whom lives in Cambridge and teaches in the Quincy public schools.
 The overseers, one of Harvard's two governing bodies, are then to vote on the nomination at their next regular meeting in early April. The members of the other governing body, the Harvard Corporation, make up most of the search committee and have already interviewed Mr. Rudenstine at length.
Mr. Bok will retire in June after 20 years as president.
Mr. Rudenstine, who has homes in Manhattan and Princeton, did not return telephone calls seeking comment today. Harvard officials reached by telephone refused to comment.
 
One of Four Finalists
 Mr. Rudenstine had been reported to be one of four finalists for the presidency. The others were Martin S. Feldstein, a professor of economics at Harvard and a former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers; Philip Leder, a prominent geneticist at the Harvard Medical School, and Gerhard Casper, the provost of the University of Chicago. Earlier this month, when the selection committee was reported to be having trouble choosing the next president, Henry Rosovsky, the dean of the faculty of arts and sciences at Harvard and a member of the search committee, was said to be a possible compromise candidate.
The choice of Mr. Rudenstine, first reported by The Harvard Crimson on Friday, would be somewhat unusual. He did not graduate from Harvard, though he received his Ph.D. there, and he has not taught there since 1968.
He graduated summa cum laude from Princeton in 1956 and then spent three years at Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar before his doctoral studies in English literature at Harvard. He taught Renaissance literature at Harvard from 1964 to 1968 before returning to Princeton as a professor of English. There he rose rapidly through the ranks as an administrator, holding the posts of dean of students, dean of the college and then provost, Princeton's No. 2 job, for 10 years.

HEADLINE: A Straight Arrow's Inexplicable Fall

BYLINE: By SARAH BARTLETT

 BODY:
She was a pioneer, one of a handful of women trying to make it in the financial industry in the 1960's and 70's. Reared on solid Midwestern values, she earned an advanced degree in business when few graduate schools allowed women even to apply. Through quiet determination and hard work, she rose through the ranks of Fidelity Investments, the giant mutual fund company, becoming a respected portfolio manager of "junk" bonds. Ultimately, she became a member of the elite circle of people close to Michael Milken, at a time when Mr. Milken and his firm, Drexel Burnham Lambert, were putting the high-yield, high-risk bonds on the map.
But in the mid-80's, Patricia Ostrander did something that those who know her find inexplicable. Apparently without a word to her superiors at Fidelity, she purchased some exceptionally valuable securities for herself from her contacts at Drexel and did not offer the same opportunity to the mutual funds she was managing. Though she used her own money, Fidelity thinks it is likely there was a connection between the investment opportunity she was offered and her earlier purchase of other securities from Drexel for her funds. Fidelity maintains that she was obligated to offer the investment to the funds. 
 At best, the transaction raised questions about Mrs. Ostrander's judgment; at worst, it raised the possibility that securities laws had been violated, especially if it amounted to a quid pro quo.
Today, a few months after many details of the transaction came to light as a result of Mr. Milken's own legal problems, Patricia Ostrander's career hangs in the balance. The 52-year-old executive is being sued by Fidelity for breaching her duties as a portfolio manager. She is also believed to be under investigation by the Justice Department, according to former colleagues who have been questioned about her actions by Government officials.
In addition, Mrs. Ostrander is facing several class-action shareholder suits relating to a fund she set up in 1988, shortly after quitting Fidelity when the company engineered a management change she was unhappy with. Among other things, the suits contend that she allowed the New America High Income Fund to be used as Mr. Milken's dumping ground for particularly unattractive securities. For two years now, New America has been one of the worst performing funds of its kind.
 
'We're All Doing It'
 As sociologists and historians begin to pick through the remains of the fever-ridden 80's, many are struggling to understand what caused so many people of professional standing to leave the straight and narrow, either through lapses in judgment or outright breaches of ethical and legal standards. Mrs. Ostrander's story is far more unsettling than that of the stereotypical 26-year-old yuppie longing for a new Ferrari and discovering how to bend the rules to get it. By contrast, Mrs. Ostrander had a lifetime of achievement to protect; her apparent willingness to jeopardize both her career and her reputation underscores just how seductive -- and treacherous -- the 80's were.
"They set up their own culture," said Samuel L. Hayes 3d, a Harvard Business School professor, speaking of those who lived in the high-yield world of Michael Milken. And in that culture, "I can imagine people saying, 'It's perfectly legitimate, you deserve it, we're all doing it.' "
In court papers responding to Fidelity's suit, Mrs. Ostrander does not deny that she bought the securities or that she kept Fidelity in the dark. She defends her position, instead, by making technical distinctions and arguing that no one was hurt by her actions. [Box, page 6.] But Mrs. Ostrander's peers, many of whom still consider themselves her friends, confess that they find her arguments unconvincing. While they said they did not have enough information to judge whether she had done anything illegal, many are now groping for a reason to explain how a woman they all respected could do something that, in their view, did not pass the "smell test."
"My reaction was shock and bewilderment," said one friend and former colleague. "It just doesn't make any sense."
Was it simply the temptation? Did Mrs. Ostrander become so caught up in the easy-money world of Mr. Milken that she considered her actions the norm? Or did she become so tired of having to fight every step of the way in a male-dominated world that she rationalized her decision as getting her due?
It is entirely possible that no one will ever know what really motivated Mrs. Ostrander, and her lawyer, Jeremiah O'Sullivan, says she has no comment on the allegations. But through extensive interviews with friends and former colleagues and an examination of court documents, at least some parts of her story can be pieced together.
 
Goodbye, Columbus
 Patricia Ostrander grew up Patsy Zelkoff in Columbus, Ohio, the eldest of three sisters. Her mother was a homemaker; her father was an emigre from Bulgaria who ran a family-style American restaurant. Her introduction to the world of finance came from standing at the cash register and helping out with the bookkeeping in the summer. After graduating from Purdue University with a degree in international relations and economics, she was accepted in 1959 into the Harvard-Radcliffe Program in Business Administration, a one-year certificate course equivalent to the first year of Harvard Business School's MBA. Harvard itself was closed to her: Women were not allowed to enroll in the M.B.A. program until 1963.
Her business degree helped her get a job as an administrative assistant in the investment department of the LaSalle National Bank in Chicago. Mrs. Ostrander has told friends she viewed the job as a backdoor into the bank, because women were not accepted into the training program, which was then the only explicit route to becoming an officer.
For the next nine years, Mrs. Ostrander learned everything she could about bonds, which were then a prime investment vehicle for the bank and its customers. Within six years, she was, in fact, promoted to officer rank.
She is still remembered fondly there. "She was a very successful young woman, and there were very few women then who were officers," said a LaSalle spokeswoman.
 
On to Boston
 In 1969, Mrs. Ostrander moved to Boston with her husband, Edward, whom she had met through the bank, where he had been a lending officer. The couple, who have no children, decided they wanted a more challenging environment. He got a job as an assistant treasurer of a Boston company. She was hired by Edward C. Johnson 3d, the autocratic leader of Fidelity, who thought it might be useful to have someone on staff who knew bonds.
Mr. Johnson's decision proved to be farsighted. Mrs. Ostrander was put in charge of managing one of the first money-market funds in the country. She was asked to start the company's first bond mutual fund. In the mid-70's, she began investing in undervalued bonds of troubled companies. One of the few salesmen she ran into was Michael Milken.
Over the next 10 years, Mrs. Ostrander developed a close relationship with Mr. Milken and several other Drexel salesmen.
She developed a reputation as an extremely private person who trusted only a handful of people and kept her distance from the rest. In the mornings, Mrs. Ostrander would come into the office, get on the phone with her contacts, figure out which way the market was going and try to trade ahead of the crowd. She spent very little time with Fidelity's high-yield analysts, relying instead on her own coterie of advisers.
Her colleagues perceived her penchant for secrecy and single-minded focus on work as a survival tactic rather than a yuppie-style attempt at ladder-climbing.
"I always had the impression her motivation was not so much money, but competition, the 'I'm going to make it' competitiveness," said one former associate, who, like others who were interviewed, insisted on remaining anonymous because of concerns about litigation.
Mrs. Ostrander more than held her own at Fidelity, where she was the only female portfolio manager until the mid-80's. Her skills at navigating the esoteric junk-bond market were highly respected, and when she occasionally spoke up in monthly strategy meetings, others would avidly take note of her recommendations.
But as the 80's dawned and interest rates started bobbing all over the place, bonds became less and less of a backwater and an increasingly hot investment area. Mrs. Ostrander began to find her quiet island increasingly invaded by a new breed of junk-bond traders, many of whom were many years her junior and considerably louder and more aggressive.
In 1981, Fidelity took its high-yield fund away from Mrs. Ostrander and gave it to an equities analyst in his late 30's named William Pike who had no prior junk-bond investment experience. At the time, many of her colleagues considered the decision unfair. "It was pure chauvinism," said one former male employee. "She should have had the high-yield fund."
Mrs. Ostrander seems never to have recovered from the apparent slight. Although she and Mr. Pike had offices adjacent to each other, for years they almost never spoke, and Mrs. Ostrander is said by former employees to have guarded her investment views from Mr. Pike with a fervor.
Despite the setback, Mrs. Ostrander persevered. She was given the bond portfolio of Fidelity's Equity Income Fund, in addition to the one she was already managing for the Puritan Fund. By the mid-80's, she was managing more than $1 billion and was racking up consistently good returns.
She continued to rely on her contacts at Drexel, and was known for weighting her portfolio heavily toward "Drexel names," companies whose bonds were underwritten by the firm. On the Street she developed a reputation for being "close to Mike," an appellation that at one point was tinged with envy but by the mid- to late-80's became a liability.
In 1987, Fidelity's top management decided to restructure the high-yield area and to put the aggressive Mr. Pike in charge. Mrs. Ostrander tried to remain outside the group, but that was regarded as administratively untidy. When it became clear that she would have to report to a man she did not respect, she brought an abrupt end to her 17-year Fidelity career. Mr. Pike, who left Fidelity a year ago and now is a private investor, declined to comment.
 
A New Start
 Mrs. Ostrander's contacts at Drexel quickly came to the rescue. They helped her design a new junk-bond fund, which Drexel underwrote. By February 1988, Mrs. Ostrander was back in business, managing $400 million. Her new venture was the subject of a glowing story in Forbes magazine entitled "The Lady Likes Leverage."
Just a few months after her fund was inaugurated, however, Ms. Ostrander's new life began to unravel. The Government's investigation of Drexel and Mr. Milken for securities violations was proceeding apace, and it was beginning to look at certain warrants that were issued in 1985 to finance a leveraged buyout of Storer Communications by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company. One question was whether the warrants were used as a "pay-off" to money managers who agreed to buy other Storer securities for their funds.
Because Storer was considered a high-risk transaction, Drexel convinced KKR to offer some special inducement to purchasers of the broadcasting company's debt and preferred shares to assure the completion of the $2.4 billion deal. Warrants for Storer were finally sold for about 7 cents apiece, exercisable into common stock at $2.05 share, or considerably less than KKR and Drexel thought the stock would ultimately be worth.
Although the warrants were intended for purchasers of Storer securities, subsequent disclosures from the Government's Drexel investigation indicated that many of them ended up in a limited partnership called MacPherson Investment Partners. MacPherson was owned by Drexel executives like Mr. Milken and an assortment of his favorite customers. More to the point, many of the partnership interests ended up in the personal accounts of certain money managers, rather than benefiting the entities they were managing. One of those was Mrs. Ostrander, who had indeed purchased other Storer securities for her Fidelity customers.
The exact size of her interest in MacPherson is not known, nor, therefore, is the amount of the profits she presumably gained from it. Another portfolio manager who received MacPherson interests, however, was said by the Government to have received $5 million from his $132,000 investment. (The preferred stock and debt securities that Mrs. Ostrander purchased for Fidelity's customers were profitable, but not nearly as much as the MacPherson interests.)
The Government investigated several other individuals who acquired MacPherson interests for themselves instead of for the entities they were managing. Some of these money managers have since settled charges with the Securities and Exchange Commission or pleaded guilty to securities violations, although other activities were also involved.
 
Call to a Lawyer
 In early January 1987, two months before Mrs. Ostrander resigned from Fidelity, she called one of Drexel's leading attorneys, Casey Cogut, and asked him how she should describe her MacPherson investment on a form she was filling out, presumably for Fidelity, according to court testimony last October. The testimony came during sentencing hearings for Mr. Milken after he pleaded guilty to a range of securities violations.
Mr. Cogut testified that he suggested she check with Fidelity's compliance officer, the executive concerned with adherence to the firm's guidelines. At that point, he said, Mrs. Ostrander emphasized that everything she had done was perfectly proper. "The tone of her voice was disturbing," said Mr. Cogut. "I was troubled by her agitation."
At the end of 1988, Mr. Cogut testified, he had another conversation with Mrs. Ostrander about the MacPherson interests. He said she told him that she had filed a form disclosing the investment to her employer but that since she had left Fidelity, she no longer had access to it.
Fidelity says, however, that she never did disclose the investment and that it only learned of it when details of the Government's investigation of the warrants were leaked to the press. Fidelity filed suit against her early last year.
How Mrs. Ostrander ultimately fares in the suit and whether she is ever indicted remains to be seen. What is clear is that in the 80's, many individuals were forced to make ethical choices in the face of extraordinary financial opportunities. At the time, it often seemed as if there were no downside risk. But in many cases, the true cost of those decisions is only beginning to be measured.
 
 
 
BEHIND THE PROBLEMS AT NEW AMERICA FUND
 Since its inception, Patricia Ostrander's New America High Income Fund has gone almost straight down. Its stock price, which was $10 a share when the fund was listed on the New York Stock Exchange in February 1988, has sunk to $3.50. The closed-end bond fund was the second worst performing of its kind in the last two years, according to Thomas J. Herzfeld Advisers Inc.
The fund's poor performance has made Mrs. Ostrander the subject of four class-action suits by shareholders. They claim that she misrepresented the risks of the "junk" bonds she was acquiring, and that she allowed Michael Milken to use her fund as a "purchaser of last resort."
Certainly her portfolio contains a high proportion of Drexel-underwritten bonds, many of which have proven to be extremely illiquid. However, Mrs. Ostrander's defenders argue that the real problem with the fund is that it is highly leveraged, which means that it has a small equity base and is heavily financed with debt.
In a rising market, leverage can make the fund's returns look spectacular, but when a market turns sour, as it has over the last year and a half, leverage has the opposite effect of magnifying losses. If the effect of leverage is excluded, the fund's performance is somewhere in the middle of the pack, says Mrs. Ostrander's spokesman, Steven Anreder.
New America's directors include Franco Modigliani, the Nobel Prize-winning economist, and Joseph Bower, a well-known professor at the Harvard Business School. The only director who responded to requests for interviews, however, was Richard Floor, an attorney with the Boston firm of Goodwin, Procter & Hoar, who had previously done a considerable amount of work for Drexel.
Mr. Floor said that he and the other directors are satisfied with Mrs. Ostrander's performance given the difficult market conditions, and are not concerned about suggestions that she grew too close to Mr. Milken. He said the directors had decided to allow her to continue to manage the fund despite Fidelity's charges because "she gave us enough comfort" that nothing she did was improper.

 
 
A TECHNICAL DEFENSE
 Lawyers for Patricia Ostrander have mounted a technical defense to counter Fidelity's claim that her opportunity to invest in Storer warrants properly belonged to the funds she managed.
The lawyers note that the investment took the form of limited partnership interests that were not publicly registered securities. That meant she did not misappropriate anything, they said, since Fidelity's internal guidelines at the time prohibited funds from holding such investments.
For the same reason, her lawyers argue, she was not under any obligation to offer the investment to her funds, or by implication even to disclose it to her employer.
Fidelity's general counsel, Robert C. Pozen, counters that the company's ethics code required Mrs. Ostrander to disclose all personal securities investments.
If Mrs. Ostrander had disclosed the investment opportunity, Mr. Pozen added, the company might have considered making an exception to its guidelines, as it did subsequently in other cases. The guidelines have since been changed to permit such investments.

HEADLINE: Wall Street's Ambitious Top Cop

BYLINE: BY STEPHEN LABATON; Stephen Labaton, a reporter in the Washington bureau
of The Times, covers financial regulation.

 BODY:
TRIM IN BLUE SHIRT SLEEVES AND striped suspenders, an electronic beeper pegged to his hip, Richard C. Breeden charged into a conference room at the Securities and Exchange Commission in Washington late on a Friday afternoon. The 41-year-old S.E.C. chairman was responding to an urgent request for a meeting with his legislative staff.
 Three days earlier, on Feb. 5, the Treasury Department had proposed the most sweeping overhaul of the nation's banking system in half a century. The massive report had far-reaching implications for Wall Street and for the investing public, which the S.E.C. has a mandate to protect. One controversial recommendation would free commercial banks to deal in stocks and bonds and sanction the ownership of banks by investment firms and industrial companies. 
Now Treasury was calling on the S.E.C. to fill in the details so that a draft of proposed legislation could be sent to Congress. But the nine S.E.C. lawyers around the conference table questioned a section that would allow banks to sell mutual funds, the widest form of stock ownership for Americans. Breeden brushed aside their doubts.
 "Let the banks sell mutual funds in the lobby. As long as they're not selling the securities of the bank or its parent company in the lobby, the way Charlie Keating did, then there won't be a problem," Breeden said. The S.E.C. is investigating the sale of bonds of the American Continental Corporation, vehicle of the high-flying entrepreneur Charles H. Keating Jr., to hapless customers of his Lincoln Savings Bank.
 Breeden grew animated. "When a customer walks into a bank, a teller can say, 'Mr. Customer, you can put your money in this account,' " Breeden said, turning up his left palm. " 'Or you can put it in this account,' " he continued, turning up his right. " 'If you put it here, it is Federally insured. On the other hand, if you put it here, it is not insured.' As long as the bank is complying with the Investment Company Act, as enforced by our team, it should be no problem." Since 1940, mutual funds have been regulated by the S.E.C. under that intricate piece of legislation.
 One staff lawyer expressed concern about the possibility of a commingling of assets that might encourage speculative activity by banks. "The quid pro quo," Breeden countered, "is that the banks cannot use the mutual fund money as part of their insured deposit base. The fire wall that exists will be between the money of the two accounts."
 The chairman signaled an end to the discussion. "We need to move fast because Treasury wants to circulate a draft by next week," he snapped. Everyone around the table understood that some staffers would be canceling weekend plans, a not unusual circumstance since Breeden took over the S.E.C. in the fall of 1989.
 Breeden's autocratic personality has become Washington legend. Detractors call him King Richard; even supporters acknowledge that he is wildly ambitious. Indeed, the Bush Administration's plan to deregulate the financial system represents an opportunity for Breeden to expand his power. It would allow the agency to monitor the growing number of businesses that banks could enter. Says Breeden, "I don't know any parts of the package on financial reform that are not S.E.C. related."
 WHEN FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT WAS sworn in as President in March 1933, the nation was paralyzed by the economic crisis that had followed the stock market crash of '29. One of his first acts was to declare a bank holiday, temporarily closing institutions in all 48 states. In the United States Senate, public hearings were laying bare a pattern of financial abuse -- insider trading, market manipulation, reckless speculation or special favors to influential friends -- by such distinguished banking institutions as J. P. Morgan and Company, National City Bank and Chase National Bank.
Congress responded with the passage of the Glass-Steagall Act, which would be the cornerstone of New Deal banking reform. The measure called for strong barriers between the commercial banking and securities industries. From 1933 to 1940, through a patchwork of legislation, the regulation of the financial system was divided among several government entities. The Federal Reserve Board, the Comptroller of the Currency and state regulators continued to supervise commercial and savings banks. The S.E.C. was created to keep watch over investment banks and the stock exchanges -- to restore public confidence in the securities markets by ensuring their efficiency and fairness.
 To the consternation of reformers, in June 1934 President Roosevelt appointed Joseph P. Kennedy, a hugely successful stock speculator, to be the first S.E.C. chairman. The President offered this rationale for his choice: "Set a thief to catch a thief." Kennedy earned general praise for his one year of service in the post, which was devoted to organizing the new agency and cleaning up the worst practices of the stock exchanges. The next two chairmen, James M. Landis and William O. Douglas were brilliant legal scholars; they put muscle in the new Federal securities laws, which emphasized the protection of investor interests by compelling full disclosure by those involved in the public trading of securities.
 From the start, the S.E.C.'s power to police Wall Street has been civil authority. Its primary enforcement weapons are injunctions, suspensions, fines and contempt actions, which can lead to imprisonment. Criminal investigations are referred to the Justice Department.
 Breeden's arrival at the S.E.C. coincided with another watershed for the financial system of the United States. With the Government forced to bail out hundreds of insolvent S.&L.'s, with giant commercial banks posting huge losses from risky loans, with Wall Street in serious retrenchment and public confidence in the system eroding, many observers have seen alarming parallels to the 1930's.
 The New Deal's remedy for the crisis was to tighten controls; the view of the Bush Administration is that many of those regulations are now stifling American banks and securities firms. According to this perspective, the rules are no longer realistic at a time when global trading has become routine and markets are dominated by large institutional investors who often deal outside the securities exchanges.
 Breeden, who has been acting as Administration cheerleader and running back, expects the S.E.C. to play a key role in the reordering of this universe. "We have a very large responsibility for the functioning of the capital markets," he says.
 FROM HIS PREPPY garb to his blue-chip credentials to his conservative pragmatism, Breeden is a striver cut to the George Bush mold. His start in life, however, was unremarkable.
 Breeden's family was living in Levittown, L.I., when he was born on Dec. 6, 1949, the eldest of three children. When he was 7 years old, the family moved to Manhattan Beach, Calif., a middle-class neighborhood near the Los Angeles airport. After failing in private business, Breeden's father went to work as a sales manager for a greeting card company. His mother taught nursery school.
 Richard Breeden set his sights on becoming a lawyer. At Stanford University on scholarship, he majored in international relations and found time to join the sailing team. "I was not among the antiwar crowd," Breeden says, referring to campus protests against the Vietnam War. Bachelor's degree under his arm, he headed to Harvard Law School in 1972. Already a dedicated Republican, he exhibited the first signs of political ambition. "He had seen John Dean's testimony before the Watergate committee," a college friend recalls, "and he said, 'I'd like to have a job like counsel to the President.' "
 Following a teaching stint at the University of Miami School of Law, Breeden in 1976 moved to New York, where he worked as an associate at two top Wall Street firms: first at Cravath, Swaine & Moore, then at Willkie, Farr & Gallagher.
 "The criticism about New York was that you worked 24 hours around the clock," Breeden says, "but I figured I could learn in three years in New York what I might learn in five or six years in California."
 He received his call to Washington in 1981, when the Under Secretary of Labor, who happened to be the father of a woman he had dated, asked him to serve as his executive assistant. A year later, C. Boyden Gray, chief counsel to Vice President Bush, tapped Breeden to be his deputy.
 Breeden directed the staff of the blue-ribbon panel that in 1984 called for the complete overhaul of regulations governing the nation's financial services industry; many of the panel's proposals turned up again in the Treasury report last month. It was a crucial assignment for Breeden, who developed expertise in Washington's byzantine regulatory structure and also established his credentials among the senior regulators on the panel.
 He moved from government to the more lucrative private sector in 1985 when he became a partner in the Washington office of Baker & Botts, the Texas law firm co-founded by Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d's great-grandfather. Breeden specialized in banking and thrift issues. His clients included the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas and several financial institutions that required Federal assistance -- among them Gibraltar Savings and a unit of MCorp.
 Yet he kept a hand in politics, helping to raise money for and advising the George Bush Presidential campaign. During the primaries, he even played Jack Kemp, the conservative Republican Presidential candidate, during a practice session for a debate. Before the primaries Breeden had worked on the Bush platform and, after the election, was invited to the White House to become the President's assistant for issues analysis. In 1989 he joined two Treasury advisers, David W. Mullins Jr. and Robert R. Glauber, in orchestrating the bailout of the savings and loan industry.
 At first, "the rap on him was that he was arrogant and nobody would want to work with him," says Rep. Charles E. Schumer, the Brooklyn Democrat who is on the House Banking Committee and was a prominent figure in the bail out. But when President Bush introduced the S.&L. legislation, known as the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act, Schumer says, "Breeden knocked on my door and asked, 'What do you think of it?' Just by doing things like that he would win people over. He was far more willing than other members of the Administration to do what had to be done to get the legislation through Congress."
 Breeden kept in touch with industry executives and lobbyists who had a special interest in the legislation. In one instance, he met with Robert J. Thompson, a lobbyist and former aide to George Bush, to "sketch some general guidelines which should prove helpful in evaluating an investment strategy," according to a memo from Thompson's office. A client of Thompson's was interested in buying assets from failed savings associations. The memo begins by noting that Richard Breeden was "an old friend from Bob Thompson's days in the White House."
 As a reward for helping get the complex legislation through Congress in the near-record time of seven months, President Bush in September 1989 nominated Breeden to be the S.E.C. chairman. The fact that Breeden, over the summer, had advised the White House personnel director, Chase G. Untermeyer, about the qualities that should be sought in a new chairman had probably not hurt his chances.
 THE MOMENT HE arrived 17 months ago at the cramped S.E.C. headquarters on 5th Street N.W., Breeden astounded everyone with his youthful energy and political smarts. He has shown signs of being the most activist chairman in decades and has set an expansive agenda, often picking his issues for maximum visibility.
 Breeden has insisted that his primary role is to "encourage the efficient formation of capital." In part, he wants to lower corporations' costs of raising money. One of his first accomplishments was to lead the commission to adopt Rule 144A. This decision makes it easier for large companies to issue and trade their securities in a private market without going through the same rigorous and expensive registration and disclosure process required for stocks and bonds offered to the public. Breeden maintains that the institutional investors who are the customers for private placements are sophisticated enough not to require all of the protections of the public market.
 Breeden has also called for the elimination of many state laws that regulate the public sale of corporate stocks and bonds -- the so-called blue sky laws. He argues that, given the jumble of state statutes, it is easier for a German company to raise money through an offering in Britain than for a New York company to sell an issue in New Jersey.
 His position is unpopular with state officials, who now receive substantial revenues from securities and brokerage registrations. They also feel, in the words of John R. Perkins, the commissioner of securities in Missouri and the president of the North American Securities Administrators Association, that "By attacking the states, Breeden is attacking the protections afforded the small investors. Remove our ability to register stocks and you remove our ability of enforcement."
 Many Breeden watchers have reached the conclusion that his quest for "market efficiency" and the commission's recent tilt away from Federal regulations requiring thorough corporate disclosures are catering to the interests of the largest market players.
 "The old S.E.C. believed that registration and disclosure of securities and other financial instruments was a virtue," says John C. Coffee Jr., a professor at Columbia University School of Law. "The new S.E.C. believes that there are times when the costs outweigh the benefits."
Breeden helped persuade a skeptical Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady that if commercial banks were to invade Wall Street by selling securities, investment houses should be able to own banks. Breeden's call for a "two-way street" opened the way for industrial enterprises to acquire commercial banks, as spelled out in the Treasury's bank-reform blueprint. Nine of the 15 largest securities companies, including Shearson Lehman Brothers, Prudential Securities, Dean Witter and Kidder, Peabody, are already owned by industrial and nonbanking companies.
 "Breeden is a person who is seeking to foster the maximum amount of innovation in the capital markets, yet he understands that you have to have traffic lights," says James D. Robinson 3d, chairman of American Express, parent of Shearson. "He's got the right perspective, which is that all the markets are interrelated." The Treasury proposal would allow the financial services conglomerate to further broaden its base by buying a full-service bank.
 On Capitol Hill, some lawmakers have drawn parallels between the Bush Administration's plan to dismantle Glass-Steagall and the Reagan Administration's deregulation of the savings and loans, which enabled the thrifts to make risky investments. In fact, senior Treasury officials acknowledge privately that, if the problems confronting commercial banks were to approach those that brought on the S.&L. debacle, the Treasury proposal would not make it through Congress.
 Despite his zeal for loosening regulatory restraints, Breeden has taken the stance of the tough cop when it comes to enforcement of existing securities laws. He has set the staff to rooting out a wide variety of frauds, pursuing penny-stock brokers as well as billion-dollar banks, both of which count small investors among their victims. The S.E.C. is currently in the midst of several investigations into securities abuses at bankrupt savings and loans.
 One of Breeden's earliest achievements was to shepherd the long-stalled Securities Enforcement Remedies and Penny Stock Reform Act through Congress last year. The law substantially strengthens the S.E.C.'s hand. Without having to get an order from a Federal judge, the commission now has the authority to ask that the assessment of monetary damages be handled by one of the S.E.C.'s own administrative law judges, who tend to favor the agency's position.
 By all accounts, the commission is seeking stiffer sanctions, such as interest on ill-gotten gains, calculated from the date of the infraction, and longer suspension times for brokers and dealers found to have cheated their customers. "Breeden's a little too aggressive in the enforcement area," laments Harvey L. Pitt, a partner at the Washington office of Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson, whose most famous client was Ivan F. Boesky. Pitt served as general counsel to the S.E.C. in the 1970's. "Breeden wants to extract the last penny out of every case and ratchet up the penalty as high as he can," Pitt says.
 William R. McLucas, director of the S.E.C.'s enforcement division, notes that, "With respect to settlements and sanctions, there's no question that Richard has taken a more active role." At closed meetings, McLucas notes, the commissioners have rejected some settlements proposed by the staff on the grounds that they were too lenient. As a result, more cases have been going to trial in Federal district courts.
 Breeden also played an unusual role in the securities fraud case of Michael R. Milken. The civil part of the lawsuit had been framed under Breeden's predecessor, David S. Ruder, now practicing law at the Chicago firm of Baker & McKenzie. Breeden's staff was actively involved in negotiating the terms of the criminal settlement with the United States Attorney's Office in Manhattan. And Breeden felt he had every right to let his feelings about Milken's sentencing be known. In a letter to Federal District Judge Kimba M. Wood before she imposed sentence, Breeden argued that the bond trader's manipulations and frauds could "ultimately destroy the efficiency of the marketplace," and warranted "a substantial term of incarceration."
 Notwithstanding its vigorous enforcement actions, the S.E.C. under Breeden is accused of neglecting some significant parts of its mission. To the dismay of institutional shareholders such as pension funds, for example, the agency has moved at a glacial pace in addressing the highly restrictive rules governing proxy contests, which make it difficult for shareholders to challenge management. "We had hoped that they would move sooner," says DeWitt F. Bowman, chief investment officer of the California Public Employees' Retirement System, which has led an effort to loosen the restrictions.
 Breeden casually dismisses the notion that he has neglected fundamental aspects of securities regulation. His critics, he says, define "fundamental" too narrowly. "They want us to just reinterpret rule 10b-7 every few years," he says of a rule relating to the manipulation of the public offering price of a new issue. "But I think we should be doing more than that."
 "More" includes the expansion of the S.E.C.'s jurisdiction to include the regulation of stock index futures, baskets of imaginary stock that permit investors to wager on whether the market will rise or fall. Stock index futures, which are traded in Chicago's commodities pits, were implicated in the October 1987 market crash as a primary factor in the deterioration of the New York markets. A Presidential task force headed by Brady recommended that, to prevent dangerous market volatility, there be greater coordination on the setting of margin requirements.
 Last year, Congress considered a bill that would have given the S.E.C. regulatory power over the stock futures markets now held by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Breeden led the charge. Although his effort had the endorsement of the White House and the Treasury Department, C.F.T.C. chairman Wendy L. Gramm enlisted the support of lawmakers from the Farm Belt. Gramm, whose husband, Texas Senator Phil Gramm, is chairman of the Republican senatorial campaign committee, stopped Breeden and his powerful supporters in their tracks. A compromise measure on the regulation of stock index futures is under consideration.
 Breeden's attention has not been confined to the national scene. He has been traveling extensively, seeking to organize his counterparts abroad in an attempt to reconcile securities, accounting, and clearance and settlement rules that are often in conflict and make it more expensive for companies to raise money across international boundaries.
 Breeden's globe-trotting recently figured in a flare-up with Rep. John D. Dingell, a Michigan Democrat and the chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, which oversees the regulation of Wall Street. Dingell's father worked on the Glass-Steagall Act when he was a Representative in the 1930's.
 In a January letter to Breeden, Dingell suggested that his requests for information about the agency were being neglected by a chairman who was traveling abroad too much. Dingell complained that staff reports had "disappeared into a black hole" in Breeden's office and -- in the Washington equivalent of a declaration of war -- ordered Breeden to account for the 10 overseas trips taken since his appointment.
 THE CHAIRMAN OF the S.E.C. presides over a staff of 2,451 employees deployed in offices in Washington and 13 other cities. Breeden, who draws a salary of $115,300, is one of five commissioners, each of whom is appointed by the President, subject to Senate confirmation, for five-year terms. By law, no more than three can be from any one political party. The terms are staggered so that one position becomes vacant in June of each year.
 Since Breeden was appointed, three commissioner slots have opened up, providing the chairman with the rare opportunity to assert firm control at the top of the agency. "Everybody but me owes his seat at the table to Richard," says Edward H. Fleischman, the most senior commissioner, who is more often in dissent than any of the others.
 Philip R. Lochner Jr., who came to the commission from Time Warner Inc., where he served as general counsel, is a former colleague of Breeden's at Cravath. Mary L. Schapiro, former counsel to the chairman of the C.F.T.C., was appointed in 1988 to complete the term of another commissioner, and reappointed last year on Breeden's recommendation. And the appointment last year of Richard Y. Roberts, a former aide to Senator Richard Shelby, represented a courtesy to Treasury Secretary Brady, who was returning a favor to the Alabama Democrat.
 Though Breeden says he strives for consensus, Fleischman, who is now serving under his third chairman, complains he is often left out in the cold. "Richard's personality is such that if you don't agree, you are excluded from the process," Fleischman says.
 Some members of the S.E.C. staff describe Breeden as a highly demanding and sometimes vindictive boss. "He's got a short temper and he doesn't really know how to use human capital well," says a senior official who insists on not being identified.
 According to one senior S.E.C. staff member, "During Ruder's days, the staff sometimes had the impression that he was working for them. Now it is clear that this staff is working for Richard."
 While Breeden has put the S.E.C. back squarely on the political map, turnover remains high; it has been 80 percent for the last five years and is still rising. He has fought hard to raise S.E.C. salary levels to near parity with those of the bank regulators.
 Breeden has doubled the size of his office and doubled the size of his personal staff, hiring an advance man from the White House to assist him in public relations and a White House confidential assistant to handle his invitations. Securities lawyers say that, when they now visit the chairman's office, they get catered meals, served by waiters, instead of soup and sandwiches.
 Breeden and his wife, Holly, live with their three boys about a half-hour from Washington in Great Falls, Va. Holly Breeden, the niece of former New Hampshire Governor Walter R. Peterson, is a fundraiser for the March of Dimes.
 Their split-level house, on five rolling acres overlooking a pond, conveys a rustic air. An empty barn serves as the final rusting place for Breeden's old and battered MG sports car. He now drives a red Porsche with the license plate 1RCB1.
 George Bush is Breeden's Mao: the walls of Breeden's office are lined with photographs of President and Mrs. Bush; additional pictures and other Bush memorabilia are strewn about the Breeden home, even in the downstairs bathroom.
 Some officials at the S.E.C. and on Capitol Hill gossip about the degree to which Breeden uses the Bush connection to enhance his own image. There is no doubt that there is a relationship between Breeden and his mentor. At a Christmas party, President Bush was overheard telling Breeden how much he was missed at the White House. And in February the White House proposed to give the S.E.C. a 20.4 percent increase in its budget for the next fiscal year, while the overall Federal budget would rise only 2.6 percent.
 But there are also signs that the Bush connection may be more superficial than Breeden likes to portray. He was not invited to a pivotal meeting at the White House in January with other regulators and officials, including Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, Comptroller of the Currency Robert L. Clarke, Treasury Secretary Brady and the chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, Michael J. Boskin. Breeden was described by friends as being livid over the exclusion, whether it was an oversight or a purposeful snub.
 WHERE WILL BREEDEN'S consuming ambition take him? His vision of a new financial order rests largely in the hands of a Congress controlled by the opposition party, which is unlikely to move quickly enough or boldly enough for his liking. That should not be fatal, however: his career has continued to thrive despite growing criticism of the Government's bailout of the savings and loans, a program he helped craft.
 There is little doubt that, at some point, the S.E.C. chairman could cash in his experience for a highly rewarding law practice. His future in Government rests with next year's elections; the President has repeatedly turned to Breeden, each time handing him more authority.
 Because his agenda is far wider than that of any S.E.C. chairman in recent memory, there has been speculation that Breeden could ultimately wind up as the Treasury Secretary. The post could become vacant if Brady decides to escape the very public criticism of him as one of the least effective senior economic policymakers in years. But Breeden may have different dreams.
 Shortly after he was named to his present post, Breeden named two family cats "Securities" and "Exchange." What, he was asked, would he name pets when the time came to move on to his next Government position?
 With a wry grin, he replied, "State" and "Department." And then -- lest anyone confuse him with John S. R. Shad, the former S.E.C. chairman who became the United States's senior diplomat in the Netherlands -- Breeden added: "I'm not interested in an ambassadorship, or anything like that."

Chart: "Breeden's Agenda"
Changing the rules:
GLASS-STEAGALL ACT (Banking Act of 1933): Restricts commercial banks from engaging in stock brokerage or investment banking activities such as underwriting corporate securities. Breeden is pushing for a major overhaul.
INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT OF 1940: Regulates the $1.1 trillion mutual fund industry. Breeden is considering revisions that ease the marketing of foreign investment funds and bring pools of collateralized securities (such as credit-card receivables) and bank offerings of common trust funds under S.E.C jurisdiction.
Modifying the tools:
RULE 144A OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933: Sets forth conditions for selling unregistered securities without filing a registration statement. Amended last year, opening door to wider range of private placements.
SECTION 10(b) AND RULE 10b-5 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934: General antifraud provisions, interpreted to forbid insider trading. (Ivan Boesky and Michael Milken paid fines to settle charges of violating 10b-5.) Breeden is resisting efforts to have Congress clarify the rule.
SECTION 14D OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 (Added in 1970 under the Williams Act): Imposes requirements with respect to public tender offers. The S.E.C. is loosening restrictions for foreign companies so that American shareholders can take advantage of their tender offers.
SECTION 14a OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934: Governs proxy contests. Pension funds and institutional investors want the rule eased so they can have more say in corporate governance; top managements are opposed. The S.E.C. has moved slowly on this issue.

HEADLINE: The Death of a Suspect -- A special report.;
In Officers' Murder Case, a Tangle of Contradictions

BYLINE: By David Gonzalez; This article is based on reporting by Ralph
Blumenthal, Evelyn Nieves, Joseph B. Treaster and David Gonzalez and was written
by Mr. Gonzalez.

 BODY:
After midnight on Feb. 5, Police Officers James McMorrow and Thomas Loeffel were on routine radio patrol in the 112th Precinct in Forest Hills, Queens.
 At the same time, three teen-age friends were cruising around the neighborhood, listening to a police radio scanner and chasing squad cars and fire trucks through darkened streets. 
Within minutes, the two officers and three colleagues were grappling with a car-theft suspect, Federico Pereira, a 21-year-old cook in a fast-food restaurant with a history of convictions on theft and drug charges. The three friends stood yards away in an empty schoolyard, watching.
 The struggle left Mr. Pereira dead. But that is about the only point of agreement surrounding his death and the indictment of five New York City police officers on murder charges.
 The indictments sent a chill through the city, coming in the wake of a case in Los Angeles that left the country repulsed by the sight of a crowd of police officers who were videotaped as they kicked and rained blows on a man who the officers said had been speeding.
 
Irreconcilable Accounts
 But unlike the Los Angeles case, the Queens incident has left no footage of Mr. Pereira's last moments. Instead, his death has ensnarled the three youths, all with minor criminal records, and the police in a thicket of seemingly irreconcilable accounts. At the heart of the dispute is a single question: Is this a case of murder by the police or an incident in which legitimate restraint had fatal results?
 Some of the sharpest differences in the accounts concern how much force was used and whether the struggle was also witnessed by other members of the police force. There are also accusations that after the incident, the police tried to intimidate the teen-agers and cover up wrongdoing by the five officers.
 Disclosures in the last few days have compounded the conflicts, raising more questions about a case that many legal experts say will be hard to prosecute.
 In the latest twist, lawyers defending the indicted officers said yesterday that the officers knew they were being watched from the schoolyard and even knew some of the witnesses. This contradicts earlier police accounts -- voiced as recently as Friday by Commissioner Lee P. Brown -- that not only were the officers unaware of any witnesses, but that a subsequent canvass of the area failed to turn up any.
 The controversy has shaken the Police Department and Commissioner Brown, who is eager to present a new image of community-based crimefighting. The indictments have also infuriated many officers who fear that second-guessing by politicians and other outsiders will cripple their effectiveness.
 None of the indicted police officers -- Officer McMorrow, 28 years old; Officer Loeffel, 25; Officer Anthony Paparella, 27; Officer John O'Connell, 24; and Sgt. Barry Goldblatt, 48 -- consented to an interview. Nor did the three witnesses. Their accounts of the events on the night Mr. Pereira died, and the aftermath, were gathered through interviews with their lawyers as well as police officials and investigators.
 
The Scene

 Witnesses in a Schoolyard
 About 1:30 A.M. on Feb. 5, the three teen-agers, Thomas Zarobinski, 18, Anthony Hickok, 17, and Ronald Harmon, 18, had just dropped off a friend in Rego Park, Queens, and were cruising along a service road that hugs the eastbound Long Island Expressway in Forest Hills.
 The youths' lawyers say the three were on their way home in Mr. Harmon's 1985 Oldsmobile after a night of video games, dinner, and chasing thrills on the police scanner, for which they had no license.
 Approaching 108th Street and 62d Avenue, by Public School 220, they saw a cluster of police cars with flashing dome lights.
 Minutes earlier, Officers McMorrow and Loeffel had driven slowly by a parked black sedan, which a later check showed was stolen. Its engine was running and a side window was smashed. Under the car's interior light, they spied a man slumped at the wheel.
 Parking their cruiser to block the car, the officers approached and saw that the ignition had been yanked out and the man behind the wheel had a screwdriver tucked into his pants, said James J. Lysaght, a lawyer representing some of the five indicted officers.
 Sergeant Goldblatt and Officers Paparella and O'Connell, all in plain clothes, drove by in an unmarked police car, and stopped to help.
 One of the uniformed officers reached through the broken window, unlatched a door and slid into the back seat, Mr. Lysaght said, declining to name the officer. With gun in hand, the officer identified himself and told Mr. Pereira he was under arrest. Mr. Pereira "went berserk, thrashing wildly," Mr. Lysaght said. "He dislodged the gun from the officer's hand."
 
Call for Leg Restraint
 A plainclothes officer then climbed into the front seat and scooped up the revolver from under the dashboard and handed it and his own weapon to Sergeant Goldblatt.
 Both officers pulled Mr. Pereira into the back seat and handcuffed him. They took him from the car, and it took four officers to wrestle him to the ground, Mr. Lysaght said.
 Sergeant Goldblatt radioed for a patrol sergeant to bring a leg restraint, and a car soon arrived with the strap.
 At this point the youths came upon the scene and saw a man lying face down, surrounded by police officers. They stopped their car yards away, at the corner of 108th Street and 62d Avenue. Their lawyer, Hector Soto, said Mr. Zarobinski and Mr. Hickok craned their necks, and over the hood of one of the police cars, saw a man in plainclothes repeatedly kicking a man on the ground.
 Mr. Lysaght denied that any of the officers kicked the suspect.
 Mr. Soto said the witnesses counted three blue-and-white squad cars and one unmarked car and perhaps 8 to 10 officers. Mr. Lysaght said that a third patrol car with two officers had arrived sometime during the incident.
 The youths then circled part way around the block, and parked their car on the other side of the broad, open schoolyard. They ran into the yard and climbed up on a bench behind a tall chain-link fence, which put them, Mr. Soto and another lawyer said, 20 to 30 feet from the police.
 Until yesterday, police officials from Commissioner Brown on down, as well as the defense lawyers, had said that the officers insisted there were no witnesses at the scene and that none were found despite a canvass of the area.
 But yesterday Mr. Lysaght and other defense lawyers said that the arresting officers had seen the youths. "The officers were aware there were civilians in the schoolyard, not witnesses," Mr. Lysaght said. He made the distinction because, he said, the word "witness" implied that the officers had broken the law.
 Thomas A. Stickel, the lawyer for one of the youths, Mr. Harmon, and for the Pereira family, said the police not only saw the youths, but waved to them.
 Mr. Lysaght vehemently denied that the officers waved.
 
Youths Were Known
 Both Mr. Stickel and Mr. Lysaght now say that Officer Paparella and some other officers and youths recognized one another from the neighborhood. "They knew his face," Mr. Stickel said of Officer Paparella. "They're around there all the time. It's like a small town, that particular part of Forest Hills."
 Lawyers for the officers said the youths were known because of "their prior criminal activity."
 Mr. Harmon, a sewer worker from Howard Beach, Queens, is on probation for joyriding in a stolen car, Mr. Stickel said. Mr. Zarobinski, a store clerk from Rego Park, was charged with a misdemeanor after he accidentally shot someone with a pellet gun, Mr. Soto said, and Mr. Hickok, unemployed and also from Rego Park, has been accused of being part of a group that schemed to steal a Mets World Series trophy from Shea Stadium.
 But the lawyers added that the police had often harassed their clients for no reason.
 
Accusation of Beating
 The youths' lawyers said Mr. Pereira offered no resistance as he lay on the pavement. His hands were cuffed behind his back, and one of his legs was bent back at a 90-degree angle and appeared to be attached to his wrist.
 "The body was not moving at all," Mr. Soto said. "There was some officer who did strike the body, kicking it."
 Mr. Stickel said Mr. Pereira "was screaming every time he got whacked." At one point, he said, an officer stepped to the curb where he scraped blood from his shoe.
 At some point, Mr. Stickel said, one or two officers waved at the youths. "Harmon saw one wave, Hickok saw one or two wave," he said. "They were laughing. They said, 'We're partying with this guy.' "
 Mr. Soto said an officer -- who Mr. Stickel said was Officer Paparella -- straddled Mr. Pereira. The officer entwined his fingers into a web, they said, put them under the suspect's neck and lifted his head back in what Mr. Soto called a "camel clutch." Mr. Soto said that the officer then pulled Mr. Pereira's head so far from the pavement that his back bowed, and Mr. Stickel said the officer jammed a knee into the man's back.
 "Then he just dropped him," Mr. Soto said. "The body was motionless."
 Mr. Lysaght's account differs greatly. He said Mr. Pereira was thrashing about in a cocaine-induced mania, banging his head against the sidewalk as officers tried to subdue him.
 "The officers used a variety of techniques in accordance with police procedure in trying to restrain him," Mr. Lysaght said.
 "I can say that at no time did my client choke him, as that word is used in common parlance," he said, referring to Officer Paparella.
 Lawyers for the officers said they radioed for an ambulance. Records of the Emergency Medical Service show that an ambulance was flagged down at 108th Street and the Long Island Expressway at 1:49 A.M.
 Mr. Pereira, who according to the E.M.S. was in cardiac arrest, was taken to St. John's Hospital on Queens Boulevard, as technicians performed cardio-pulmonary resuscitation. They arrived at the hospital 15 minutes later and Mr. Pereira was pronounced dead.
 Mr. Lysaght said the officers thought Mr. Pereira was still alive when he was brought to the hospital. The officers themselves were hurt in the scuffle and went on sick leave that morning, he said.
 
The Investigation

 Police Inspectors and TV Crews
 Mr. Pereira's death triggered what the police at first thought was a routine investigation.
 The chief of inspectional services, Daniel F. Sullivan, said last week that a roving inspector assigned to do unannounced patrol checks that night, Kevin W. Rohan, went to the scene, tape-recorded statements from all five officers and ordered detectives and internal affairs investigators to search for witnesses. None were found, Chief Sullivan said, and no one told the department about the youths in the schoolyard.
 The three teen-agers, meanwhile, trailed the ambulance to St. John's. They ducked inside the emergency room, Mr. Stickel said, and "clearly saw the young man was dead."
 Later that same day, Mr. Zarobinski and Mr. Hickok returned to the schoolyard, where television crews were getting local reaction to a report from the Medical Examiner that Mr. Pereira had died from asphyxiation and that his death was ruled a homicide.
 
Talking to Reporter
 The two youths told a reporter for WNBC-TV, Carol Jenkins, that they had seen the arrest, and gave their account of police brutality, thinking their identities would be withheld. But to their surprise, Mr. Soto said, they saw their names flashed onto the screen on the 11 o'clock news that night.
 But even before that broadcast, the youths' lawyers say, the police were looking for Mr. Zarobinski and Mr. Hickok.
 About 6 o'clock that evening, the police stopped Mr. Harmon and three other friends in his car, after they noticed that a taillight was out. The officers then discovered the police radio scanner in the car. Mr. Stickel and his investigator, Bill Novotny, said an officer peered at Mr. Harmon and asked, "Don't I know you?"
 Mr. Harmon, they said, replied "No." The officer then ran over and punched Mr. Harmon in the head and yanked him out of the car, the lawyer and the investigator said.
 He was taken to the station house, where officers started to write out a ticket. Mr. Stickel said Mr. Harmon noticed a photograph of Mr. Pereira on the desk of Detective Stephanie Rich. "Harmon says, 'You looking for him? I just saw him the other day,' " the lawyer said.
 The detective, he said, responded that Mr. Pereira had died earlier that day after his arrest. "Harmon says, 'I saw it,' and that started seven hours of questioning," Mr. Stickel said.
 Mr. Stickel asserted that while the police tape-recorded their questioning of Mr. Harmon, they coerced him into saying that he had seen Mr. Pereira swing at the officers. At one point, Mr. Stickel said, an officer told Mr. Harmon, "You're going to have a tough way to go if you don't go along with us, but if you do, you can go home."
 Mr. Stickel said that the police also tried to get Mr. Harmon to cooperate by tearing up traffic tickets they had issued after they stopped him.
 Chief Sullivan said a half-written ticket had in fact been preserved and was turned over to the precinct's Integrity Control Officer.
 The next day, Feb. 6, Chief Sullivan said, Mr. Soto called and told him that Mr. Zarobinski claimed to have witnessed Mr. Pereira's death. Mr. Soto said Mr. Zarobinski's father had called him and said the youth was scared after seeing the television broadcast the previous night.
 Chief Sullivan dispatched a team of Internal Affairs investigators who interviewed Mr. Zarobinski.
 The following day, Mr. Hickok also contacted Mr. Soto.
 Chief Sullivan said he was puzzled why the witnesses came forward separately.
 But Mr. Soto's partner, Nicolas Velez, said: "It seems perfectly clear to me they were afraid. How do you go and report against the police? To the police?"
 Mr. Stickel said that in the weeks after Mr. Pereira's death, Mr. Harmon's dog was poisoned and his car tires slashed. "We're certain that the police did it to keep him from changing his story, as a reminder," he said.
 But Mr. Lysaght said the police had no reason to threaten Mr. Harmon since his account already supported theirs.
 Mr. Soto said there were other instances in which officers from the 112th Precinct harassed the witnesses and their neighbors. Commissioner Brown said those allegations were being investigated by the department.
 
The Aftermath

 Findings from Autopsy
 On Wednesday the five officers were indicted on charges of second-degree murder and suspended without pay. Two days later. Commissioner Brown and defense lawyers who had access to the Medical Examiner's report said that it did not back up the witness accounts that Mr. Pereira was kicked and beaten.
 As far as he knew, Commissioner Brown said, the autopsy found "no medical evidence of a beating."
 Marvyn Kornberg, the lawyer representing Officer Loeffel, said the report showed no internal injuries.
But Mr. Soto -- who did not see the report, but was told of it -- maintained that the facial cuts and bruises it described were consistent with his clients'testimony that Mr. Pereira had been kicked mainly in the shoulders and head.
 The autopsy report found needle track marks on Mr. Pereira's arm, 0.1 milligrams per liter of cocaine in the blood and 0.5 milligrams of cocaine per kilogram in the brain, with greater amounts of trace chemicals. Several independent pathologists, including Werner Spitz, a professor of pathology at Wayne State University School of Medicine, said the report suggested that Mr. Pereira had ingested a "substantial" amount of cocaine. Even a small amount of cocaine, Professor Spitz said, could cause hyperactivity.
 
Dispute Over Report
The pathologists also said pressure applied to the neck was capable of causing death in a matter of seconds under certain circumstances.
 Mr. Lysaght said that his repeated attempts to obtain the Medical Examiner's report were refused. "To me, it's a clear indication that Santucci wanted that indictment after that L.A. thing," he said of the decision by the Queens District Attorney, John Santucci, to present evidence against the five officers before a grand jury, which voted the murder indictments.
 But the investigation was under way a month before the Los Angeles brutality case first appeared in news accounts on March 3.
 Mr. Velez said his clients had nothing to gain from their testimony.
 "It's all in their best interests not to have seen anything," he said. "The police are not going to forget."
 Commissioner Brown said on Friday that he had ordered an inquiry into operations of the 112th Precinct, but that he knew of no systemic wrongdoing within the command.
 Mr. Lysaght, who regularly defends police officers accused of misconduct, said he feared that the publicity surrounding this case would trigger copycat complaints.
 "I fully expect," he said, "that I'm going to see a lot of activity this year."

HEADLINE: The Big Test: How to Translate The Talk About School Reform Into Action?

BYLINE: By SUSAN CHIRA

 BODY:
COMPARED with Lamar Alexander, Norman Schwarzkopf had it easy. Mr. Alexander, sworn in as Education Secretary on Friday, faces a task that has frustrated generations of reformers: improving American schools.
 Making America an educational as well as a military superpower will mean confronting several crises: the glaring failure of the worst students, the tolerance of mediocrity, and a national heritage of anti-intellectualism. It will mean combating poverty and shoring up disintegrating families. It will require grueling work from students and an end to parental apathy. 
Last year, President Bush and the nation's governors prescribed a series of ambitious goals to be met by the year 2000. American students should catapult from last to first in math and science achievement. Every American adult should be skilled and literate. Children should arrive at school ready to learn, their potential unclouded by poor nutrition or inadequate prenatal care.
 It proved much easier to enunciate the goals, however, than to figure out how to achieve them. Task forces of the governors and White House staff continue to labor over that problem, with no concrete recommendations in sight. Mr. Bush's proposed 1992 Federal budget offers modest increases in some areas, particularly the widely praised Head Start preschool programs, but no large influx of money. Some states and cities are trying radical ways to overhaul schools, but results are years away.
 Now that the Persian Gulf war is over, Mr. Bush clearly hopes his education appointments will help counter complaints that he has no strong domestic policy. Mr. Alexander pushed through educational reforms as Tennessee's governor and as president of the state's university system. David T. Kearns, who will be his deputy, used his platform as chairman of Xerox to call for efforts to improve American education.
 But the breast-beating over the state of education has not inspired a public commitment to reform. Most Americans think it is someone else's problem.
 Mr. Alexander cites polls showing that 80 percent of parents give the nation's schools a C or below, but 72 percent grade their own child's school A or B. Many parents and children are satisfied with mediocre performance, beguiled by a creed that values feeling good about yourself over pushing yourself.
 Smart children are often taunted as nerds, and smart black children told they are "acting white." Bart Simpson, that cocky underachiever, is a cult hero. A principal in rural Mississippi complains that high school football games land on the front page of the paper every week, while the town's first National Merit Scholarship finalist in 20 years merited only a back-page mention.
 Signs are that students are getting the message. According to the Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan, American junior high school students spend an average of 3.2 hours a week on homework; their Japanese peers put in 16.2 hours. About 1 percent of American 18-year-olds take advanced physics examinations, said John H. Bishop, an economist at Cornell University who studies education, compared with 11 percent of Japanese. Unsurprisingly, East Asian and Western European schoolchildren regularly trounce their American peers in international tests.
 Of course, many Americans would be reluctant to draw lessons from systems that are unapologetically elitist and hierarchical. In many Asian and Western European countries, academic standards, curriculum and school management are national, not local, affairs. Children must pass a succession of national tests to get into the few top schools that alone guarantee entry to the best jobs. Students know they usually have just one shot at success, and watch their opportunities narrow as test results place them either on an academic track or a vocational one.
 As unfair as such a system might seem, there is no denying that it focuses attention. There are obvious rewards for academic achievement and penalties for failure. And, at least in Asia, society reveres rather than mocks educational excellence.
 While most American educators stop short of recommending such draconian measures, they complain that students have no clear incentives from society at large, most colleges or most employers. Examples of poorly educated entrepreneurs who struck it rich abound, showing students that the path to making money does not necessarily depend on education. No matter how lackluster their academic records, most students can usually get into some college.
 In a survey of American employers, Mr. Bishop found that most never requested a job-seeker's high school transcript. "In Europe, a diploma establishes that someone is above a certain level," he said. "Here, it doesn't even provide an assurance of literacy."
 As a result, many educators argue, most students see no point in pushing themselves. "Kids in their own way are rational creatures, who go through an informal calculus of whether there is any real reward for studying hard, learning and doing well, or any tangible punishment or pain if they take easy courses and slide by and don't try very hard and don't do very well," said Chester E. Finn Jr., a former assistant Secretary of Education. "So put yourself in the head of a 16-year-old deciding whether to go out and party or stay home and work on the history paper."
 The demands of international competition, however, are bound to force higher standards, greater selectivity, and more clear-cut rewards for academic achievement. Graduate programs in engineering, science and mathematics are increasingly dominated by foreign students, a trend the United States will have to reverse if it hopes to keep pace with Asian competitors. The need for more sophisticated knowledge applies both to scientific laboratories and the assembly line.
 Take General Motors' new Saturn automobile plant in Tennessee, where Mr. Alexander is from. "There, the headlight assembly team helps decide who new team members will be," he said. "They don't want any new team member who doesn't know math, reading skills, who doesn't understand spatial relationships, who doesn't have good team skills, because a team member without those skills can't make a defect-free headlight, and because if they can't do that people will buy Toyotas and they won't have jobs."
 Stories like this provide ammunition for Mr. Finn and others who argue that the country needs the discipline of a national test for high school seniors, with the results available to colleges and employers. "Americans don't know how they're doing," he said. "They get these misleading test results in which everyone scores above average. It's as if all the teachers went to smile school. There is nothing in these report cards calculated to alarm you about your child's performance."
 Harold Stevenson, a University of Michigan psychology professor, found that Asian parents expected a higher level of achievement from their children than American parents did. While Asian parents believed that hard work bred academic success, American parents were more likely to cite inborn ability. "We can't understand why Americans have such low standards for their children," Mr. Stevenson said. "Here you must feel good about yourself. But they ignore the fact that you can feel good about yourself by doing well."
 Yet the prospect of national standards and tests -- in effect, a move toward European and Asian practices -- raises the question of what Americans should emulate about those societies and what they should shun. There are few more cherished national beliefs than that of America as a land of opportunity, where most people can make it, at most any time in their lives.
 
'Deliciously Messy'
 "The evidence is clear that a lot of talented people bloom late," said Theodore R. Sizer, a Brown University education professor who heads the Coalition of Essential Schools, a network of schools dedicated to improving themselves. "One of the great glories of the American system is how deliciously messy it is. All sorts of people can rise."
 The question is not really whether standards should be higher -- they will have to be -- but how best to achieve them while honoring American traditions, if that is possible.
 "Can we have it both ways -- can we have tangible rewards for real performance, tangible unpleasantness for failure, and at the same time not shut off opportunities?" Mr. Finn asked. "I don't know. We've gone too far in the direction of saying there's never really a judgment that makes a difference. We're always happy to let you start again."
 And while students in Europe and Asia have national curriculums, the extraordinary diversity of American society, and the demands of its competing ethnic groups, make any such agreement unlikely. One need only look at the fierce debate about multicultural education to know how difficult it would be to outline precisely what every American should know.
 But a national test could enforce a de facto national curriculum. The prospect encourages those like E. D. Hirsch Jr., the author of "Cultural Literacy," who argue that educated Americans should be able to draw on a common vocabulary of ideas. That notion alarms those like Deborah Meier, who founded the widely acclaimed Central Park East elementary and secondary schools in East Harlem. Her schools teach children how to learn rather than prescribing a set curriculum. "I'm afraid a national exam would deaden things," she said.
 While Mr. Alexander does not support a national curriculum, he said he believes national standards could be developed without imposing homogenization. Mathematics teachers, for example, recently agreed on an outline of principles students should master at different grades. "The math profession has defined new world standards and is developing ways to measure progress toward those standards," Mr. Alexander said. "That still leaves Debbie Meier and her teachers free to invent hundreds of ways to help her children succeed by learning mathematics to that standard."
 The dilemma is whether it is possible to balance egalitarianism with excellence, to have standards without standardization. In Japan, for example, teen suicides and the relentless pressure to succeed are well documented. But a Confucian reverence for learning, strong family support and general economic prosperity help to insure that even those students who fail to get into college know enough to become productive workers and educated citizens.
 This kind of dedication may be the best lesson the United States can learn from its competitors. "Parents and the rest of society have to honor student experience in school," Ms. Meier said. "You can't order people to play Mozart beautifully. You have to have some inner sense of pleasure, and there has to be a real audience, with real people who are really pleased."

HEADLINE: Harvard Finds a Replacement for Its President

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass., March 23

 BODY:
Neil L. Rudenstine, a 56-year-old scholar of Renaissance literature who is former provost of Princeton University, has been offered the presidency of Harvard University by the committee seeking a candidate to succeed Derek C. Bok.
 Friends and associates of Mr. Rudenstine, who is now executive vice president of the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, said he was expected to meet with Harvard's Board of Overseers on Sunday at a hastily called gathering in New York. At the meeting, the overseers are to appraise Mr. Rudenstine and he is to signal whether he will accept the job, his colleagues said. 
The overseers, one of Harvard's two governing bodies, are then to vote on the nomination at their next regular meeting in early April. The members of the other governing body, the Harvard Corporation, make up most of the search committee and have already interviewed Mr. Rudenstine at length.
 Mr. Bok will retire in June after 20 years as president.
 Mr. Rudenstine, who has homes in Manhattan and Princeton, did not return telephone calls seeking comment today. Harvard officials reached by telephone refused to comment.
 
One of Four Finalists
 Mr. Rudenstine had been reported to be one of four finalists for the presidency. The others were Martin S. Feldstein, a professor of economics at Harvard and a former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers; Philip Leder, a prominent geneticist at the Harvard Medical School, and Gerhard Casper, the provost of the University of Chicago. Earlier this month, when the selection committee was reported to be having trouble choosing the next president, Henry Rosovsky, the dean of the faculty of arts and sciences at Harvard and a member of the search committee, was said to be a possible compromise candidate.
 The choice of Mr. Rudenstine, first reported by The Harvard Crimson on Friday, would be somewhat unusual. He did not graduate from Harvard, though he received his Ph.D. there, and he has not taught there since 1968.
 He graduated summa cum laude from Princeton in 1956 and then spent three years at Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar before his doctoral studies in English literature at Harvard. He taught Renaissance literature at Harvard from 1964 to 1968 before returning to Princeton as a professor of English. There he rose rapidly through the ranks as an administrator, holding the posts of dean of students, dean of the college and then provost, Princeton's No. 2 job, for 10 years. He still teaches a popular freshman class on Shakespeare at Princeton.
 He was widely regarded as the logical successor to William G. Bowen, Princeton's president, when Mr. Bowen resigned in 1987 to become head of the Mellon Foundation, which concentrates on educational programs and, with assets of more than $1.8 billion at the end of 1989, is one of the nation's 10 wealthiest foundations. But Mr. Rudenstine surprised his colleagues when he elected to accompany Mr. Bowen to the Mellon Foundation.
 
'Knack for Leading'
 Friends say Mr. Rudenstine is a gentle, thoughtful man, and Princeton officials highly praised him today.
 "I've known Neil since he was an undergraduate, and I just think enormously highly of him," said Robert F. Goheen, the president of Princeton from 1957 to 1972.
 Carl Wartenburg, who was an assistant to Mr. Bowen when he was president and now is assistant to Princeton's current president, Harold T. Shapiro, said: "Neil would have been a very popular choice for president here. He is a man of great integrity and wisdom, who has a knack for leading without making you feel he has taken the initiative away from you."
 Eugene Y. Lowe Jr., Princeton's dean of students, said that when Mr. Rudenstine came to Princeton in 1968 there were 3,200 male undergraduates. "When he left the place in 1988, it was coed and much more diverse," Dr. Lowe said. "During those 20 years, you could say Princeton transformed itself, and Neil was in the middle of it all."
 Dr. Lowe and others at Princeton said Mr. Rudenstine has several qualities that Harvard is especially interested in, given its current needs. Harvard, for example, is about to begin a $2 billion fund-raising drive, the largest capital campaign ever by the university, and Mr. Rudenstine had helped oversee a highly successful $400 million fund-raising drive at Princeton. Moreover, Dr. Lowe said, Mr. Rudenstine proved to be a tough budget administrator, another quality Harvard needs as it faces a serious budget shortfall.
 Mr. Rudenstine's wife, Angelica Zander Rudenstine, whom he met while a Rhodes Scholar in Britain, is an art historian and currator. She is currently chairwoman of the supervisory committee for Harvard's department of fine arts. The Rudenstines have three children, one of whom lives in Cambridge and teaches in the Quincy public schools.

HEADLINE: THEATER;
Babies, Sisterhood and Economics

BYLINE: By ALVIN KLEIN

 BODY:
A COUPLE of years ago, four women -- two actresses, one director and one playwright -- sat around, talking about an idea for a play. "What's on your mind?" and "What keeps you awake?" were among the questions the director asked.
One actress said she wondered what would happen if women from extremely disparate economic backgrounds were thrust into a crisis together. The other was concerned about the plight of a woman who could not conceive a child. Separate ideas, they assumed. "But it's one play," said the playwright. And then she wrote it. 
 In essence, that's how "The Baby Dance," which opened at the Long Wharf Theater in New Haven on Thursday, came to life. Jane Anderson's play, directed by Jenny Sullivan and performed by Linda Purl and Stephanie Zimbalist, had its premiere in February 1990 at the Pasadena Playhouse. The playhouse's artistic director at the time, Susan Dietz, had brought the women together in the first place.
Following a three-month California run, "The Baby Dance" played two weeks at the Other Stage, the tryout arm of the Williamstown Theater Festival in Massachusetts last summer, and was then brought back for an additional two weeks, with all performances sold out in advance.
 
Great Expectations
 In New Haven, the play runs through April 28.
"The Baby Dance" has aroused great expectations, following a heartening period of gestation and an unusually strong and consistent commitment to it by Ms. Sullivan, Ms. Purl and Ms. Zimbalist, who, in effect, commissioned the work and have a financial stake in it.
Ms. Anderson's plot concerns a well-to-do, infertile Los Angeles couple (Richard and Rachel, played by Joel Polis and Ms. Zimbalist) who place an advertisement in a newspaper. The word "Pregnant?" appears at the top in boldface. In part, the copy reads: "Happily married couple, educated and financially stable, want to give a healthy white baby a lifetime of love, laughter and security. We can help with expenses."
The advertisement is answered by Al and his ever-pregnant wife, Wanda (played by Richard Lineback and Ms. Purl), who already have four children and live in a trailer park in Louisiana.
The first act is mostly concerned with the relationship between the worn-out Wanda and the cool Rachel who, may come off as patronizing and disapproving at first but does not want to jeopardize her chance of getting the baby. The second act, which shifts tone -- too drastically, some observers of the first two productions felt -- is set in a hospital room a month later. There, the two husbands and a smarmy lawyer talk about deals. For the Long Wharf engagement, some revisions have been made in this act, including the ending.
Before a recent preview, the four "Baby Dance" collaborators -- three of them make a point of insisting "Jane wrote the play" -- talked about the work's journey over the past two years.
 
'It's a Big Story'
 Ms. Sullivan commented on the director's adjustments from two roughly 100-seat theaters to the thrust stage in Connecticut, with a capacity close to 500. And, along with the others, she fantasized about what some consider an inevitable move to an Off Broadway or Broadway theater.
"Here, we have to open it up, but keep it claustrophobic," Ms. Sullivan said. "It's a big story we're telling, and it's challenging to fill a bigger space.
"We thought that by now we'd turned over every stone, but new stones have appeared. We have to catch the audience laughing one minute and crying the next -- and we're all older. By that I mean more mature, of course.
"As a director, I mother a lot. We're reaping all the benefits of everyone's life lessons."
Among the lessons Ms. Sullivan and Ms. Purl imposed upon themselves was a trip through Louisiana, from Shreveport to Monroe, with visits to tiny towns like Gibsland and Shoedron. During the trip, the director and the actress, armed with tape recorder and video camera, interviewed local residents in beauty parlors, beer halls and trailer parks.
"At home, there was always a TV game show or a soap opera on, and always a Bible on view," Ms. Purl recalled. "We were clearly California girls out of place, and the people were skeptical at first. We said we were doing a documentary film or taking a survey -- we kept changing our stories. But by the time we got to Monroe, we told the truth, and it worked better. Then, they were warm and open."
 
Heritage Includes Abuse
 Ms. Purl (who was born in Greenwich) and Ms. Zimbalist also visited maternity wards and adoption agencies and met with social workers and counselors of abused women. "Abuse is not a big ingredient in the play, but it's part of Al and Wanda's heritage," Ms. Purl said.
Ms. Zimbalist said she was intrigued by the idea of the bonding of women whose paths would never normally cross. "The play is an attempt to bridge that gap, with total conviction and good intentions -- up to a point," she said. "But I know that Wanda won't come poolside to be my best friend."
Ms. Anderson once wrote comedy material for her own one-woman multicharacter show in which she played an alcoholic husband, a sperm donor, a stage mother, her husband, their daughter as well as "the real Mona Lisa," she said. "In America, class is getting more and more defined, and our differences are getting more severe. Each of the two couples in the play has what the other does not have -- and both are desperate."
About the play's effect upon audiences, Ms. Anderson said: "Middle- and upper-class and mostly white armchair liberals may get uncomfortable with their own smugness. We still judge others and pretend not to. There's a lot of comic relief in it, but I hope it shakes people up. And pregnant women should stay away."

A Peninsula Hotel, With Separate Villas

BYLINE: By ANDREA ADELSON

 BODY:
THE Peninsula Group, a Hong Kong hotel company known for its Old World-style luxury properties in the Far East, will open a new hotel in Beverly Hills this summer, its second in the United States.
The cost of the hotel, the 200-room Peninsula Beverly Hills, including land, will be more than $100 million, said Robert Zarnegin, president of the Probity International Corporation of Los Angeles, the developer. Rates are expected to range from $265 a night to $2,500 for a two-bedroom, separate villa on the grounds. 
 The Peninsula Group, which will manage and have a 20 percent equity share in the new hotel, began its United States diversification in New York in 1988, paying $127 million for the Maxim's des Paris-Gotham Hotel on Fifth Avenue and 55th Street, now the Peninsula Hotel, and began offering rooms at $250 a night.
In opening a luxury class hotel in the Los Angeles area, it joins a growing movement by hotel developers to mine the industry's richest vein, a movement that has fueled a small building boom of prime hotels in recent years. Analysts say the luxury end of the market in Los Angeles has not suffered as much as the rest of the market, despite the recession, which helped make last year unprofitable for most of the nation's hotels.
Among operators of luxury hotels, "it's getting more competitive, but not less profitable," said Paul DeMyer, hospitality director for Kenneth Leventhal & Company, a Los Angeles real estate accounting firm.
Even so, hotel development, like other forms of real-estate development, is finding bank loans harder to get.
"Hotels are at the top of the heap in terms of risk," said John P. Sipple, a hotel broker for Grubb & Ellis, the national commercial brokerage company.
Among the primary full-service Los Angeles hotels, overall occupancy fell to 69 percent last year from 73 percent in 1988 and rates rose to $112 a room from $102, a 9.8 percent increase, according to Kenneth Leventhal. There were 40 hotels with 16,673 rooms in 1990, compared with 34 hotels with 15,584 rooms in 1988.
THE same trend could be seen at luxury hotels. Occupancy fell to 68 percent from 72 percent and rates rose on the average to $276 a room from $231, a 9 percent increase, to offset the loss in operating revenue.
Consultants say that luxury hotels are characterized by room rates beginning at $180 a night, development costs of $200,000 a room or acquisition costs of $225,000 a room. They offer extraordinary service and amenities and typically have fewer rooms than nonluxury hotels.
This category was dominated during the early 1980's in Los Angeles by a local developer, Severyn Ashkenazy, who built Bel Age and Le Mondrian in West Hollywood and L'Ermitage, a remodeled condominium, in Beverly Hills. They have a total of 530 rooms.
More recently, Asian investors began seeking this market. In 1987, the Sultan of Brunei paid $187 million for the 263-room Beverly Hills Hotel. Regent Hotels of Hong Kong bought the 456-room Beverly Wilshire for $125 million in 1985. And in the most expensive deal so far, Japan's Sekitei Kaihatsu Company in 1989 paid $115 million, or $1.2 million a room, for the secluded 92-room Hotel Bel-Air.
Aside from the Ashkenazy properties and the Asian-owned hotels, the only other site in Los Angeles most consultants considered in this category was the 256-room Westwood Marquis.
The number of luxury hotels will have nearly doubled in only four years with the opening of eight new properties, all competing for the wealthy traveler.
Already in business are the 285-room Four Seasons near Beverly Hills, which opened in 1987; the 188-room Checkers Hotel downtown, which opened in 1989; the 350-room Loews Hotel, the 311-room Ma Maison Sofitel and the 306-room Ritz-Carlton in Marina Del Rey, which all opened in 1990, and the renovated 383-room Ritz Carlton Huntington Hotel in Pasadena, which opened this month.
Besides the Peninsula, another luxury hotel that is scheduled to open this sumnmer is the 198-room Park Hyatt in Santa Monica.
The Peninsula "will have immediate recognition in the Los Angeles basin with Pacific Rim business," said Joseph G. Kordsmeier, a Carmel, Calif., hotel consultant. "They have the reputation as the best in the Far East."
The group's flagship property, known as The Pen, "is still the power place in all of Hong Kong," Mr. Kordsmeier said.
A 20 PERCENT stake in the hotel is owned by a public company -- it is traded on the Hong Kong exchange -- that is 69 percent controlled by the Kadoorie family, British nationals who live in Hong Kong and whose wealth was estimated at $1.6 billion by Fortune magazine in 1990.
Peninsula Group and its six hotels is a unit of Hong Kong and Shanghai Hotels Ltd., whose chairman is Michael Kadoorie, son of a British lord.
The Peninsula Beverly Hills's development cost makes it, on a per-room basis, the most expensive new hotel to be opened in Los Angeles. It is also the first hotel built in Beverly Hills since the Beverly Pavilion, on Wilshire Boulevard, in 1963. The architect was Three Architecture of Dallas.
Mr. Zarnegin, whose company also owns the hotel, said he expects it to be profitable in its third year, with occupancy at 65 percent or more. He predicted that the larger $2,500-a-night villas will have lower vacancy rates than the standard rooms.
He and his brother, F. Bo Zarnegin, who grew up in Beverly Hills, succeeded in piecing together a 2.2-acre parcel of 16 lots over 15 years, a feat that had eluded other developers. The triangular site is on Santa Monica Boulevard, near Rodeo Drive boutiques and Century City high-rises.
Other developers with smaller parcels found they were not economical because of the city's 45-foot height limit, Mr. Zarnegin said.
In 1982, the partners first proposed a larger, 250-room, hotel with a 250-seat banquet hall. During the ensuing years, and through several different administrations at City Hall, the number of rooms was trimmed and the hall shrank to 60 seats to satisfy the concerns of homeowners.
"It went through the longest scrutinization anyone could go through," Mr. Zarnegin said, adding that his having lived in Beverly Hills made no difference.
"This city doesn't need anything," Mr. Zarnegin said, "and the residents don't need anything."
Because of Probity's larger parcel, the company was able to meet the height requirements and still build a 195,000-square-foot hotel. There will be, in addition, 195,000 more feet underground for parking, providing 310 parking places, of which 66 will be for the community and the rest for guests. this at request of the city; there had been 1 bldg on lot, rest was parking lot.
What will $265 a night buy? A hotel that says it "will never say 'no' " to a legal request and that has 15 types of marble, $1 million in landscaping, 65,000 linear feet of ceiling moldings, Rolls-Royces for shopping sprees, low-noise toilets and personalized stationery.
"We will provide old-fashioned service and product and charge accordingly," Mr. Zarnegin said.
In searching for a hotel operator, he and other executives from his company visited 20 hotels in Europe, Asia and the United States. "We felt Peninsula is the best we've seen," in the world," he said.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Deal Keeps the Buzz Alive in Los Angeles

BYLINE: By DEIRDRE CARMODY

 BODY:
Starting a new magazine can be an endeavor fraught with financial peril. Eden Collinsworth, who started Los Angeles-based Buzz magazine in October, found that out last month when Buzz was forced to suspend publication for lack of money. Vowing that Buzz would be back, she set out to raise $4 million.
Two weeks ago, a Thai publisher suddenly appeared and expressed interest in rescuing the magazine, which is a mix of journalism, fiction, gossip and commentary about Los Angeles. He agreed to provide much of the necessary money. 
 The magazine's rescuer is Sondhi Limthongkul, the chief executive and majority owner of the Manager Publishing Group, which together with his other companies in Thailand has annual revenues of $400 million.
 
Expanding Internationally
 Last month, Mr. Limthongkul said he was interested in buying United Press International. Recently, he acquired Frye & Smith, a California-based printing company.
"He is actively expanding his operations internationally," said Douglas Tanner, a lawyer at Milbank Tweed Hadley & McCloy who represents Mr. Limthongkul. "He has been in discussions about acquiring U.P.I. and employing it in developing his business."
In 1982, taking advantage of a booming Thai economy, Mr. Limthongkul founded the Eastern Magazine Company to publish Manager, a monthly business magazine in Thailand. The magazine is now published in both Thai and English. He subsequently started a society magazine and a weekly financial newspaper in Thailand. In 1989, his media properties were consolidated under the Manager Publishing Group.
 
Stocks and Real Estate
 Peter Kennedy, a former senior vice president of The Economist magazine in New York who is now in charge of Mr. Limthongkul's international publishing operations, said Mr. Limthongkul's money came mostly from stocks and real estate.
Mr. Limthongkul, who has a master's degree in history from the University of Utah, wants to develop an international publishing business that includes North America as well as Asia, Mr. Kennedy said.
"By Thai standards, his publications are fairly large and he has invested a lot in technology," Mr. Kennedy said. "He has one of the most sophisticated data bases on the Thai economy and stock market."
Mr. Kennedy brought Buzz to the attention of Mr. Limthongkul. Mr. Kennedy, who lives in Hong Kong, was visiting Hawaii and met a laid-off Buzz staff member. She told Mr. Kennedy about Buzz's financial plight and gave him a copy of the magazine.
 
'So Foreign and So Abstract'
 Ms. Collinsworth, the president and chief executive of Buzz Inc., said that when she received word that a Thai businessman wanted to invest millions of dollars in the magazine, she simply shrugged off the idea.
"I was pursuing every avenue, but this was so foreign and so abstract," she said. "Then we met him two weeks ago and it became obvious to us right away that he really wanted to do this."
A letter of intent has been signed, with a closing scheduled on or before April 15. Although details are still being worked out, Ms. Collinsworth said her company would be restructured with Mr. Limthongkul as the majority stockholder.
She declined to say how much Mr. Linthongkul was investing in Buzz, but indicated that his investment would enable the magazine to follow its original business plan, which calls for it to become profitable in three and a half years.
 
West Coast Vanity Fair
 The magazine plans to resume publication in August as a bimonthly and become a monthly in the fall of 1992.
Buzz, which is a sort of West Coast Vanity Fair, has been well received by many of its readers. It will increase the circulation rate base it guarantees to advertisers to 65,000 from 50,000 when it resumes publication. Issues up to now have averaged 50 pages of advertising, with 80 percent coming from national advertisers, Ms. Collinsworth said.
Buzz will continue to fight for its place in a crowded Los Angeles market, which includes Capital Cities/ ABC's Los Angeles magazine and American Express's L.A. Style. And on April 7, The Los Angeles Times will introduced its redesigned and enlarged Sunday magazine, which is to have extended coverage of Southern California.

HEADLINE: Transit Authority Consolidating Its Offices

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Can't City Hall Stop Inflation of Bureaucracy?" (letter, March 6), Nancy H. Fink criticized the New York City Transit Authority's planned occupancy of the Livingston Plaza office building under construction in downtown Brooklyn. She believes that the occupancy of this building by the T.A., in addition to its headquarters building on Jay Street, reflects recent increases in the Transit Authority's corps of office workers, which in fact has not occurred.
The Transit Authority occupies leased office space in several buildings scattered around downtown Brooklyn, Manhattan and Queens. A great deal of this space is in seriously deteriorated buildings, and the Transit Authority has occupied some of this space for 20 years. 
 More than seven years ago, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the state agency that is the governing body of the Transit Authority, began exploring the possibility of consolidating these offices into a single building convenient to the T.A. headquarters building.
Livingston Plaza was selected as that building, and the office space in that building will be fully occupied by existing employees.
The Transit Authority will at the same time give up the leased spaces these employees occupy. Any significant expansion of T.A. office forces would mean acquiring more space.
I believe that Livingston Plaza represents a healthy recognition on the part of the T.A. of the needs of its workers for decent space and that the on-budget, timely (actually, ahead of schedule), completion of the building is a demonstration of the M.T.A.'s ability to work with the private sector. Obviously, initial occupancy costs will exceed those under 20-year-old leases in obsolete buildings. Our costs will, however, be significantly lower than those incurred in most new buildings and will remain fixed, as the Transit Authority will purchase the building.

HEADLINE: Brighter Days for Machine Tools

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
New orders for machine tools, often an important weathervane for the economy because the equipment is used by a wide range of major manufacturers, are showing surprising strength.
Orders from aerospace, automobile and appliance companies rose 5.4 percent last year, after plunging by 22 percent in 1989. And industry executives say they still have more orders on their books this year than they have seen in a decade. The executives also point out that those orders are coming from foreign as well as domestic companies and are spread across the industry spectrum. 
 Costing $500,000 or more, machine tools are sophisticated machines that cut, grind, bend, drill or shape the metal parts that go into products ranging from Boeing 747 planes to Caloric kitchen stoves. Economists regard orders for these machines as a good indicator of manufacturers' willingness to invest in their factories.
 
Executives in Bullish Mood
 There is evidence of increased demand. New orders for the first two months of this year were up 15 percent, 27.7 percent in February alone.
Citing the increase in demand, despite the recession and the related slump in the auto industry, which is an enormous customer for machine tools, industry executives are in a bullish mood. Tool makers in the last few years have been closing unprofitable plants, undertaking large modernization projects and developing more varied product lines. At the same time, they have benefited from the lower dollar, which has sent more foreign customers their way.
"We hear a lot about the recession," said William J. Fife, chairman of Giddings & Lewis Inc., one of the nation's tool companies. But the slowdown seems to be "more on the consumer side than on the capital-goods side," he continued, adding: "Our orders are strong and demand seems healthy. What we're seeing here indicates that things are going well."
The renewed strength is quite a turnaround for an industry that was ravaged by intense foreign competition in the early 1980's, mainly from Japan and Germany, and more recently by reduced spending by big industries at home. Those factors had led many industry analysts to predict continued declines in new orders in 1990.
 
Worst Is Over, Analysts Say
 Many analysts say that, while conditions will not be strikingly better this year, the industry has already weathered the worst. "The machine tool industry took its punishment in 1989 and 1990, and it has already been through its recession," said Eli S. Lustgarten, a securities analyst who follows the industry for Paine Webber.
Even so, some analysts see clouds on the horizon. They note that the industry remains highly fragmented, weakened by past foreign competition, and is struggling to overcome a legacy of poor management and underinvestment in research and development. As the industry moves to cope with those problems, these analysts say, the growing substitution of plastics for metals puts a damper on prospects for growth.
For now though, industry executives and analysts say that sales are robust, with a great deal of the increase coming from foreign customers, as the declining dollar has made American products more attractive.
 
Foreign Orders Up 16.8%
 Indeed, foreign orders rose 16.8 percent last year, said the Association for Manufacturing Technology, an industry trade group. "We find that American machine tools are just as competitive in price as machine tools made here," said a buyer for a German construction company.
On the American side, there seems to be a growing sense among manufacturers that they have to increase their capital spending to be more productive and compete internationally, said Daniel J. Meyer, chairman of Cincinnati Milacron Inc., one of the nation's largest makers of machine tools. "And I think there will be continuing increases in capital spending in the 1990's, not just throwing money at new equipment but for product design."
Indeed, the auto industry, whose weakness had been a major contributor to the slowdown in machine tools, is beginning to show signs of retooling as it develops new engines to comply with Federal clean-air legislation enacted last year, executives in the tool industry say. The auto companies are also making major changes in body styles, which adds to the demand for machine tools.
 
Buying by Aerospace Industry
 Orders from the aerospace industry have also been strong in recent months. "Boeing is stepping up its production schedule," said William G. Copeland, head of the Copeland Economics Group, a consulting firm. "They are about to start their new 777 aircraft program, which is a $4.5 billion to $5 billion program, with complete new tooling and design." But he added that back orders for planes are at record levels and will come down in the next year.
Critics say the industry has been slow to invest in its future. American makers of machine tools "haven't invested near the amount that Germany and Japan have since the 1982 recession," said George Graen, executive director of the University of Cincinnati's Center for the Enhancement of International Competitiveness.
Mr. Graen said American tool companies spend 1.5 percent of gross sales, on average, on research and development, compared with 2.5 percent to 3 percent for their German and Japanese competitors. He said foreign-made machine tools already had nearly 50 percent of the American market. With relatively low research spending, American tool makers could lose even more ground.
"A growing reliance on foreign machine tools could hurt United States manufacturing if foreign suppliers reserved their most advanced machines for their home markets or if shipments were cut off during political disputes," Mr. Graen said.
 
Stock Prices Depressed
 Such concerns have been reflected in the stock prices of tool makers. Severe price competition has undermined earnings at the Cross & Trecker Corporation, a large tool maker based in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., pushing its share price down to $3.375 as of Friday, from $10 last summer. In the same period, Cincinnati Milacron's share price slipped to $13.875, from $22. And shares of Giddings & Lewis, based in Fond du Lac, Wis., a leading maker of large, high-precision machine tools, had dropped below $14, from $21, before regaining ground to its current price of $20.
Giddings & Lewis stands out in the industry because of its low debt and strong capitalization. Mr. Lustgarten at Paine Webber said Giddings had "up-to-date products and is investing heavily in its own manufacturing ability." The company is a leading proponent of versatile new machine tools called manufacturing cells, which can readily accommodate parts of different sizes and make quick changes. More flexible manufacturing methods could reduce the amount of inventory tied up in production and allow manufacturers to modernize in small steps.
By contrast, Cincinnati Milacron, which in the 1980's became a leading supplier of equipment that shapes industrial plastic, has seen demand falter in recent months.
Cross & Trecker has also been badly hurt. The company, which relies heavily on business from the auto industry, was hurt last year by lower orders, intense price competition and high marketing costs.
But the tool makers remain optimistic. "I think there will be continuing increases in capital spending in the 1990's," Mr. Meyer of Cincinnati Milacron said. "And our industry will benefit from it."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Fed Expected to Forgo New Interest Rate Cuts

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Many credit market analysts expect the Federal Reserve to forgo a further reduction in short-term interest rates when its policy-making Open Market Committee meets tomorrow.
"It is clear to me they are going to stop here," said Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at the Chase Manhattan Corporation. "The best thing the Fed could do here is take a two-month vacation." 
 The issue will almost certainly be discussed by the Open Market Committee. The Fed's last move to ease credit, when the overnight Federal funds rate was reduced to its current 6 percent target on March 8, after the release of weak February employment statistics, appears to have created some dissension within the Fed. It seems that a number of Fed governors, including John LaWare and Robert Parry, are unhappy.
 
'Some Disagreement'
 "Based on public statements, it seems there is some disagreement" among committee members "about how the Fed should have responded to the February employment data," said Mickey D. Levy, chief economist at CRT Government Securities.
"With the level of real economic activity still low, there is no chance they will move to tighten monetary policy," he added. "But if the Fed eases again prior to any clear improvement in inflation, bond yields will rise considerably."
Indeed, long-term investors, whose primary concern is inflation, are wary about the Fed's last cut in the Federal funds rate. Analysts say another cut in short-term rates would risk an increase in long-term bond yields, a development that would further postpone economic recovery. In addition, the Fed has other reasons to be cautious, analysts said.
 
Rebound in Confidence
 Surveys show that consumer confidence, a key precondition for increased spending, has rebounded since the end of the war in the Persian Gulf. Further evidence to that effect is expected tomorrow, when the Conference Board is scheduled to release the results of its March survey.
In addition, recent data from the housing industry suggest that activity may have hit bottom in January. And over the last two months M-2, the monetary aggregate most closely followed by the Fed, has increased by $47 billion. The rise has put M-2 growth in the middle of the Fed's target range for the aggregate. Analysts said they did not think the Fed wanted to see it grow much faster.
"With the unemployment rate at 6.5 percent, they obviously are not going to tighten policy," said Jerry L. Jordan, a senior vice president at First Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles. "But a whole lot of things point to not moving monetary policy any more."
 
Rise in Jobless Expected
 Based on weekly unemployment claims data, it seems very likely that the unemployment rate will show a further increase when the Labor Department releases March employment data on April 5. But the Fed, which has reacted to the last two employment reports by easing policy, would probably sit on its hands should that occur, the analysts said.
Economists are confident the sharp increases in core inflation posted during the first two months of the year will be reversed as 1991 progresses. But as Mr. Levy suggested, bond market investors will need to see tangible evidence of improvement before the Fed's credibility as an inflation-fighter is fully restored. And more than one good set of price numbers will probably be needed to accomplish that task.
The recent inflation numbers were "very fluky, and unworthy of a policy response," said Lawrence A. Kudlow, chief economist at Bear, Stearns & Company. "I think the official inflation reports are going to fall off a cliff in the next three to six months."
 
Lower Funds Rate Predicted
 A decision to delay any further easing of policy does not necessarily mean that the Fed's current approach, which began in earnest last July, has run its course. Some analysts continue to say that the funds rate will be moved lower in coming months.
"All the risk is on the down side in the economy," said John D. Paulus, chief economist at Morgan Stanley & Company. "In those circumstances, a drop of another 25 basis points to 50 basis points makes some sense."
In addition to watching for clues about Fed policy, credit market participants will receive a few more nuggets of information this week about the economy's performance in March. The first bits are expected today, when auto makers report sales figures for the second 10 days of the month. Most analysts are forecasting some improvement, but not much, from the dismal annual rate of 5.9 million units reported for the first 10 days.
On Thursday, the March survey of purchasing managers in the Chicago region is expected. Analysts at Salomon Brothers expect the report to show that this barometer of activity in the manufacturing sector moved higher for the second straight month.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising;
Consumer Pessimism Rises, A Report by Grey Indicates

BYLINE: By KIM FOLTZ

 BODY:
A STUDY to be released today by Grey Advertising found that a majority of consumers were shaken by the Persian Gulf war, discouraged by the recession and saw the American dream of a good life slipping out of reach.
The study, conducted in December and February, found that consumers felt vulnerable because of problems over which they had little control, including the war, AIDS, the homeless and environmental pollution. 
 The report concluded that the euphoria produced by the United States' victory in the war was bound to be transitory and that consumers did not see the victory as a sign that the country had found a solution to its long-term problems.
Seventy-five percent of those polled questioned whether their hopes and dreams for the future would ever come true.
"The easy-come, easy-go attitude that was prevalent in the last decade is gone," said Barbara Feigin, executive vice president and director of strategic services at Grey. "Americans no longer believe life will simply get better and better, and they have become very cautious and uncertain about the future."
Ms. Feigin said the study found that consumer optimism had drastically eroded. In a poll conducted by Grey in 1989, 75 percent of those questioned said they were optimistic about the future. In the new study, 52 percent voiced the same sentiments. Most said they would now have to learn to live with less.
Most of those polled said they have been forced to tighten their belts. A quarter said an adult in their household had either lost his or her job or had taken a cut in pay. Two-thirds said they were cutting spending by buying cheaper brands of household goods. Many said they were forgoing or postponing expensive purchases.
Grey interviewed 725 consumers who said they were the heads of households, asking them about their expectations and priorities, as well as their buying habits and other activities.
There were some bright spots, Ms. Feigin said. Some people said they had bought expensive electronic home-entertainment equipment, presumably because they were staying at home more, she said. And many said they had not given up small luxuries like gourmet food, wine and expensive cosmetics.
But consumers were also more skeptical about brand-name products. The percentage who believed that a brand name alone was an assurance of quality has dropped by 6 percentage points since Grey's 1989 study to 61 percent in the new report.
As a result, advertising will have to become more informative, Ms. Feigin said. "Ads are going to have to contain more news and hard information about products," she said. "More consumers want to know what's in it for them."

HEADLINE: February Jump In Tool Orders

 BODY:
Spurred by sharply higher demand from domestic manufacturers, new orders for American-made machine tools climbed 27.7 percent in February from the January level, according to a report scheduled to be released today.
The Association for Manufacturing Technology, the industry trade group based in McLean, Va., said new orders increased to $255.2 million last month. The figure is a 31.2 percent increase from February 1990. For the first two months of this year new orders increased 15 percent over the comparable 1990 period. 
 Analysts attributed the increase to higher capital spending by American manufacturers in virtually all industries, including aerospace, construction and oilfield equipment. Orders from domestic customers increased 26.5 percent in February from the January level.
Orders from foreign customers declined nearly 17 percent in February. Analysts suggested that the decline was a result of recent strength in the dollar.
Albert W. Moore, president of the association, said that more gains were likely in the coming months. "The fact that machine tools are used to make everything from oilfield equipment to motor vehicles means that they will be needed by companies that are modernizing or expanding their manufaturing facilities," he said.
Shipments of machine tools rose 11.2 percent in February from the January level.

HEADLINE: STATES AND CITIES ARE PUSHING HARD FOR HIGHER TAXES

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
A wave of new taxes and tax increases -- the third since the 1930's -- appears to be developing in states, counties and cities.
Many taxes that Americans pay today to these governments originated in two similar periods when money for public services ran short: the Great Depression and a 15-year stretch starting in 1961 when the bills came due for the baby boomers' public schooling. 
 The latest trend shows up in the numerous state and local taxes enacted last year or proposed for enactment in 1991. It is reflected in bitter debates over which public services are so essential that taxes must rise to pay for them. And it is seen in the willingness of three old foes of a state income tax -- Connecticut, Tennessee and Texas -- to consider adopting one.
"When a state adopts or even proposes an income tax, that is almost like a country going to war," said John Shannon, a tax expert at the Urban Institute. "It is the most traumatic thing that a governor can lay on the backs of his constituents."
Not since New Jersey adopted an income tax in 1976 has any state publicly considered instituting one. More broadly, the booming 1980's generated so much revenue from existing taxes that budget surpluses were commonplace, and the pressure for new state and local taxes diminished. Only in the last two years, as a slowing economy and then a recession eroded tax collections, have officials been forced to make tough choices about more taxes or fewer services.
In what may be an acknowledgement of the budget pressures, opposition to tax increases has been surprisingly muted, especially in contrast to the tax revolts of the late 1970's -- although Americans today pay a total of $540 billion a year to their state and local governments in property, sales and income taxes. By comparison, the Federal tax on personal income is smaller: $493 billion.
More important, in contrast to the 1960's and 1970's, the states, counties, cities and towns, rather than the Federal Government, are now absorbing most of the rising cost of public health care, education, prisons, waste disposal and other public works.
This transfer has produced what Alan Auerbach, a University of Pennsylvania economist, and others call "a new Federalism," in which the debate over national concerns like education, public health insurance and programs for the poor is shifting from the White House and Congress to state and city governments, which are paying a growing portion of the bills.
"The corollary of this shift is that states and cities are increasingly adopting different standards for programs that concern our society as a whole," said Harold Hovey, president of State Policy Research Inc., which publishes newsletters on tax trends.
Last year, more than 30 states enacted laws intended to raise $10.3 billion in annual revenue. So far this year, 21 Governors have sent their legislatures bills that are likely to raise another $10 billion or more, according to estimates by the Center for the Study of the States and other organizations that survey state finances. It has been years since states have raised such huge amounts.
 
End of Avoiding Tax Rise
 "The states had been putting off tax increases, borrowing and using up their surpluses, and they finally got to the point where they couldn't put off the increases anymore," said Scott Mackey, a policy associate at the National Conference of State Legislatures.
Most of the new tax legislation, which became effective in the fiscal year that began on July 1, raised sales taxes, broadened their coverage and raised excise taxes and fees on cigarettes, liquor, gasoline, auto registrations and the like. New Jersey and a few other states increased personal and corporate income tax rates, but not until this year did some of the 10 states without a personal income tax begin to give ground.
"The states have been finding ways to get around the public opposition to broad-based taxes," said Marcia Howard, research director of the National Association of State Budget Offices. "They are taxing things like long-distance phone calls and tire sales."
 
Range of State Proposals
 Nevertheless, formal proposals to enact personal income taxes are before the legislatures in Connecticut and Tennessee. Nevada is considering a limited payroll tax. And in Texas, where the budget deficit is rising and a recent court ruling ordered the state to create "equal" school districts at a cost of more than $1 billion a year, Lieut. Gov. Bob Bullock this month became the first high state official in memory to propose publicly a personal and corporate income tax.
"I know deep down in my heart that it is the right thing to do for Texas," Mr. Bullock was quoted as saying. Gov. Ann Richards has neither endorsed nor rejected the proposal.
For governments below the state level, the main source of revenue is the property tax, which is rising, bringing in ever more money to cities, towns and counties. A preliminary survey shows that last year's collections reached $154 billion, up more than 12 percent from the $137 billion of 1989, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Rising tax rates and numerous reassessments of property are likely to produce another sharp jump in revenue in the fiscal year that begins on July 1, Mr. Mackey and other experts predict.
 
First, Budget Is 'Scrubbed'
 Across the nation, governors and mayors are taking a similar approach to raising taxes. Mr. Hovey says this approach has become known as "scrubbing the budget."
"You must show that you have gone through the budget with a fine-tooth comb," he said, "eliminating fraud, abuse, surplus workers, wasteful spending, and you have pared down the budget as far as possible before ever considering tax increases."
Thus, Mayor David N. Dinkins of New York City announced his intention to trim $850 million from spending while also seeking $1.2 billion a year in new tax revenue. In Connecticut, the campaign by Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. for a personal income tax also carries a commitment to lay off state workers, freeze salaries and reduce other spending.
In Iowa, which has a surplus but is bracing for a deficit, Gov. Terry E. Branstad seeks to raise $25 million through a higher cigarette tax while slashing $20 million from a fund to buy land for state parks and wildlife preserves.
"Next year we will have to cut more spending," said Gretchen Tegler, Iowa's acting budget director. "But we haven't gotten to the point where we have to say we can't cut anymore and we have to raise taxes."
 
Layoffs in Waterbury
 In Waterbury, Conn., however, the city's $7.5 million budget surplus turned into a $2.5 million deficit by last June 30, the end of the 1990 fiscal year. With Governor Weicker cutting more than $4 million in state aid that it had counted on, the city government announced this month that property taxes would rise 12 percent for the year that begins on July 1, instead of the 7 percent originally planned.
"We are meeting with some fairly stiff early resistance to this proposal," said Paul Rizza, the city's director of audit. Nearly half of the city's $195 million annual budget goes to education, principally to pay for salary increases required under contracts for teachers, police and firefighters. But along with the property tax increase, the city has also announced layoffs.
"The early number is 234 people, but it is yet to be determined who goes and who doesn't," Mr. Rizza said.
Several developments are making the early 1990's another period of rising state and local taxes, similar to the period between 1931 and 1937, when the state income and general sales tax first came into widespread use, and to the 1961-to-1976 period, when another batch of states adopted income and sales taxes to help pay for the baby boomers' education.
The cutback in Federal spending, which began more than a decade ago, certainly plays a role in prompting the tax increases. The huge rise in Medicaid costs, which now represent 12 percent of all state spending, is an even more important factor, said Ms. Howard of the National Association of State Budget Offices.
Costly outlays for new prisons also contribute to the pressure for more tax revenue, as does the cost of raising teachers' salaries and hiring more teachers to reduce class sizes. Money for welfare, the rebuilding of highways and waste-disposal and sewer systems is also pushing state and city budgets into deficit. But the main problem, experts say, is the recession that began last year.
This recession, of course, is not the first to dampen corporate profits, personal income and retail sales, shrinking the tax revenue from these sources. The same thing happened in the 1981-82 recession, and the states, in particular, responded with tax legislation in 1983 that produced as much new revenue as last year's laws. But the recession ended in 1983 and the boom that followed generated more than enough tax revenue until 1989 to cover spending. Some states with growing surpluses even cut taxes in the mid-1980's.
 
Sluggish Growth Is Expected
 A similar rebound from the current recession would also undercut the need for more taxes. But most economists say that when the economy does start to expand again, the growth will be too sluggish to generate enough revenue from existing taxes to balance budgets. What is more, surpluses that existed in the last recession are gone today and spending for hard-to-cut programs like education and Medicaid represents a larger portion of total outlays.
"People have less maneuvering room to avoid raising taxes than they had before," said Douglas Peterson, senior policy analyst at the National League of Cities.
Perhaps reflecting these pressures, there is less evidence today of the sort of opposition that gave rise in the late 1970's to Proposition 13 -- the California revolt against rising property taxes -- and similar protests.
In the November election, for example, candidates who favored higher taxes were defeated, or in some cases won re-election by narrow margins, but at the same time, voters rejected a number of ballot proposals to reduce taxes. As Ms. Howard of the budget-office group put it, "Anti-tax sentiment is pushing against what I would think is some reasonable momentum to cover costs and eliminate deficits."

HEADLINE: METRO MATTERS;
Metering Water: Will It Drown The Landlords?

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
To Robert C. Rosenberg of the Bronx, trickle-down isn't an abstract economic theory. It's a formula for business losses that may presage a renewed wave of abandonment by owners of marginally profitable apartment buildings in New York City.
Typically a landlord's lament doesn't elicit much sympathy. Yet the experience of property owners like Mr. Rosenberg appears to illustrate another case of good intentions gone awry. The consequences for all New Yorkers could be profound. 
 Mr. Rosenberg is worried about water meters; his concern goes beyond pending investigations into how they were installed. His building at 3201 Park Avenue in the South Bronx now has one. His tenants in each of the building's 90 apartments do not.
Mr. Rosenberg has a compelling reason to fix leaks and reduce waste: his company is liable for the entire water bill. Civic responsibility alone may not provide enough motivation for tenants to conserve, though. Some short-sighted ones might even subject their landlords to water torture.
In 1987, when Mr. Rosenberg's water charges were based on the number of feet the building occupied along Park Avenue, he said, the bill was $9,784. Last year, since a meter was installed to measure consumption, the bill gushed to $58,396, he said. Mr. Rosenberg still hasn't paid it.
 The rate of property-tax delinquencies in New York City has climbed to a 10-year high -- about 3.5 percent citywide. It has nearly doubled since 1989. Much of the increase reflects the recession and market forces affecting commercial buildings.
 But as more meters are installed in rental apartment houses, a surge in water charges may contribute to the delinquency rate and perhaps to abandonment. As the administration of Mayor David N. Dinkins ponders the political implications of an environmental policy it inherited, rallying landlords may echo a historic refrain: "Remember the main!"
Carol O'Cleireacain, the City Finance Commissioner, says the landlords' lament sounds credible. Angelo Aponte, the State Housing Commissioner, also expresses concern about the financial impact on rental buildings.
Until five years ago, only commercial structures and new residential buildings in the city were required to install water meters, which are common in most other large cities. As the city suffered another drought, it ordered the installation of 630,000 meters in private homes and apartment buildings within 10 years. So far about 150,000 meters have been installed, mostly in one- and two-family homes.
Instead of the flat rate, consumers pay according to how much water they use. The city had estimated that as much as 30 percent could be conserved, but officials told the City Council recently that the savings might be less than half that.
The fees pay for the city's water system; rates are projected to rise by nearly 20 percent July 1.
The apparent unintended consequence precipitated by metering recalls a similar reform: the city's efforts to prolong the usefulness of its Fresh Kills landfill on Staten Island by raising the fees to private haulers to discourage dumping. When revenue from the fees plummeted, officials briefly considered reversing the policy last year because raising money seemed a greater priority.
Water-metering may prove equally vexing. Installing meters in every apartment would be an enormous undertaking, and there are no plans to do this. The landlords' Rent Stabilization Association suggests instead "some form of rough justice," like apportioning among tenants at least some of the difference between the old flat rate and the new metered charges.
City officials acknowledge that landlords of some larger residential buildings may be suffering but say water bills for most small homeowners have shrunk.
"There is a shift based on the true amount of consumption," said Richard Mendes, executive director of the New York City Water Board. "By and large, in the aggregate, it balances out."
It hasn't at another Bronx building, 1411 Townsend Avenue, where the owner said water charges soared from $13,710.36 in 1990 to $41,759.65 in 1991.
At Mr. Rosenberg's building, environmental inspectors pointed to "possible abuse or negligent water use by the building's tenants, a variable which we have absolutely no control over," he said.
"Water metering has proven that it has a built-in disadvantage for densely populated, low-income apartment buildings with numerous doubled-up families," he said. "Water charges are as much as my fuel bill. I'm in jeopardy of losing the building. And my tenants' last stop, if I don't succeed, is the street."

HEADLINE: It's Cheaper to Give Unpaid Leave Than to Dismiss, U.S. Study Says

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 24

 BODY:
Giving workers unpaid leave for family illness or the birth of a child may be cheaper for employers than letting the workers quit and hiring permanent replacements, according to a study for the Small Business Administration.
The study, by Eileen Trzcinski, an assistant professor of economics at Cornell University, and William T. Alpert, an associate professor of economics at the University of Connecticut, found that the cost of giving unpaid leave to a worker was relatively small if the savings in not paying that employee's salary was taken into account. 
 The House and the Senate are considering legislation to guarantee up to 12 weeks' unpaid leave to workers whose companies have at least 50 employees. The House Education and Labor Committee approved the bill on Wednesday, and the full House is expected to debate it next month.
 
Bush Threatening Veto
 President Bush threatens to veto the bill as an undue burden on employers, just as he did a similar one that Congress passed last year.
The study was based on questionnaires sent to 10,000 companies, of which about a third replied.
In calculating the expense of letting workers take unpaid leave, the study asked companies to estimate costs like hiring replacements, letting work pile up until the employee returns or dividing the absent employee's tasks among other people.
For companies with one to 15 employees, the average weekly cost of letting a nonmanagerial worker take leave was $333.67. But that average employee had been paid $320.98 a week, and when that saving was deducted, the cost to the employer was $12.69, the study said.
That net cost for nonmanagers goes down to 97 cents a week for companies of 16 to 99 employees but increases to $97.78 for companies with more than 100 workers, the study found.
 
Outlook With Managers
 With managers, the picture changes. The figures seem to indicate that companies can make money letting some of them stay home.
In companies with one to 15 employees, the net cost of letting managers take leave is $42.11 a week.
But with companies of 16 to 99 employees, there is a net savings of $30.66 in letting managers stay out of the workplace, and in companies of 100 or more employees, the cost is just $1.20.
The study said the cost of terminating nonmanagerial workers and hiring replacements who had to be trained averaged $1,078 in companies with 15 or fewer employees, $783 in companies of up to 49 employees, $1,143 in those of 50 to 99 employees and $1,131 in those of 100 or more workers.
For managers, such termination and hiring costs averaged $1,187 in the smallest companies, $2,115 in those of 16 to 49 workers; $1,911 where there were 50 to 99 employees and $3,152 in companies larger than that.
Ms. Trzcinski said the figures meant not that companies could be run without managers but simply that they could get by for a while.
"You can't have it go on indefinitely," she said.

HEADLINE: Chrysler Seeks Sales Curbs on Japan Autos

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, March 24

 BODY:
The Chrysler Corporation has asked the Bush Administration to put pressure on Japan to limit car and truck sales in the United States for the next 12 to 18 months, warning that a surge in sales by Japanese auto makers could put it out of business.
The President has not directly responded to the request, which came in a letter from Lee A. Iacocca, the Chrysler chairman, to President Bush. But the Treasury Department indicated that the Administration was not inclined to support protectionist measures like those suggested by Mr. Iacocca.
Excerpts of Mr. Iacocca's letter, which was dated March 6, appeared in The Detroit News and Free Press on Sunday, along with excerpts of the Treasury Department's background paper, which addressed issues raised in the letter. The background paper was obtained by The News and Free Press. A Chrysler spokesman declined to comment on the published excerpts, saying Mr. Iacocca's letter was "personal."
In the letter, the Chrysler chairman suggested that if Japanese auto makers could be persuaded to cut exports by 500,000 vehicles this year, they could be limited to their current share of the American market, about 31 percent. Otherwise, he said, Japan's auto makers may cut their prices to reduce growing inventories of unsold vehicles, causing their market share to grow to 40 percent.
"Unless the Japanese act now to immediately cut back their export shipments, they will begin to 'distress merchandise' this huge amount of overshipment and their share will rocket up again," Iacocca said in the letter.
"I can tell you, Mr. President, at a Japanese share of 40 percent in a depressed industry, Chrysler is gone and Ford could be mortally wounded from a competitive standpoint," Mr. Iacocca wrote. "Even G.M. is at risk unless and until we decide as a nation that a domestic auto industry is a strategic industry and should not be allowed to fall victim to Japan's industrial strategy of targeting key industries." Mr. Iacocca said his proposed limits on Japanese sales should remain in effect until American auto makers "regain their footing."
The outlook for Chrysler has looked increasingly bleak in recent months as the company's sales and profits have dwindled. The entire industry has been mired in a downturn for nearly two years, and as the smallest domestic auto maker, and one that was on the brink of financial collapse just a decade ago, Chrysler appears less able than the Ford Motor Company or the General Motors Corporation to weather the current climate, while paying the huge development costs required in producing a full line of models.
 
Chrysler Stands Alone
 None of the Big Three auto makers has prospered in direct competition with the Japanese, but only Mr. Iacocca favors United States intervention against the Japanese industry. Japan's voluntary limit on car exports has declined sharply since the early 1980's, to about 1.6 million from more than 2.6 million. But in recent years, as the Japanese have built factories in the United States, they have been selling more and more American-made vehicles and importing fewer vehicles from Japan.
The Treasury Department managed the Government-guaranteed loans that saved Chrysler from bankruptcy in 1980. Since the mid-80's, the Government has declined to request Japanese export restraints, although Japan has agreed to limit vehicle exports nonetheless.
Indeed, the Treasury Department's background paper noted that the Japanese auto industry has invested $6.4 billion in American plants and employs about 25,000 American workers. Moreover, the Big Three have significant investments in the Japanese auto companies, and they sell Japanese-made vehicles under their own nameplates.

HEADLINE: U.S. Is Asked To Review Japan Trade

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 24

 BODY:
Unhappy with the continuing huge trade deficit with Japan, the National Association of Manufacturers has asked President Bush for a complete re-examination of the United States' relationship with Japan.
The policies of the Bush and Reagan Administrations have been rooted in the belief that trade imbalances would automatically improve as Tokyo responded to market-opening pressures and a lower, more competitive exchange rate for the dollar. 
 But the business leaders say progress has been far too slow and uneven. Indeed, Chrysler has asked the Administration to put pressure on Japan to limit car and truck sales in the United States. [Page D10.]
Although the deficit fell to $41.1 billion in 1990 from its record of $56.3 billion in 1987, the improvement was largely in low-technology areas. The gap has widened in the high-technology industries that provide the greatest potential for jobs and wealth, business leaders say.
"Progressively what you are finding is that more and more of the high-tech, high-growth, high-end jobs are being controlled by the Japanese, which will gradually affect our quality of life," said Prof. Bruce R. Scott of the Harvard Business School.
In a letter dated March 13, the president of the 12,500-member manufacturing association asked President Bush to set up a panel to review trade with Japan.
"While N.A.M. members across a broad range of industries have a lot of different concerns about Japan, they do agree that fundamental policy assumptions seem shaky and may be wrong and certainly need to be re-examined," said R. K. Morris, director of international trade for the manufacturers group.
Ellen L. Frost, corporate director of international affairs for the United Technologies Corporation and the head of the association's Japan Working Group, said, "Some are more frustrated than others, but all of us felt the need for stepping back with a view to understanding that mixture of competition and partnership that we have with Japan."
 
Congressional Pressure
 The complaint comes at a time when many members of Congress remain unhappy about Japanese trade and economic policies. Congress is expected to put pressure on the Bush Administration to maintain a hard line in various trade disputes with Japan, including those involving computer chips, the awarding of public works contracts, and the opening of Japanese rice markets.
Japanese officials did not welcome the call for a re-evaluation. A Foreign Ministry spokesman, Taizo Watanabe, who visited Washington last week with Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama, stressed that present policies were "creating profit and mutual benefit."
He said that if a re-evaluation moved the United States into a "more confrontational phase," this would be "damaging to both nations."
But the association's letter suggested that the Presidential panel should ask: "If these present relationships continue, what will happen to the United States with respect to living standards, leading-edge technologies, research and development-intensive exports, per-capita income in the year 2000 and beyond?"
 
'No Objections'
 The deputy United States trade representative, S. Linn Williams, the Administation official most closely involved in trade negotiations with Japan, said he had "no objections in principle" to a policy review, saying such exercises are "often healthy."
He said the Administration was actually pleased with the way its trade policy has developed. "Reasonable people can differ on the speed of market access," he said in an interview last week. "Yet I can think of no instance in which we have disappointed an industry that has a problem."
The Administration's policy has worked well in Europe. A substantial trade deficit with the European Community in 1987 has turned into a growing surplus. An important reason for this change, economists say, is that market forces are permitted to operate with fewer restrictions in Europe than in Japan.
For many high-technolgy products, the deficit with Japan has actually grown, according to figures compiled by the Economic Strategy Institute, a Washington research group working with the manufacturers.
 For example, between 1987 and 1990, the trade imbalance in office machines, computers and electrical and power-generating machinery rose by $2.3 billion. The gap, however, narrowed by $3.6 billion for logs, breakfast cereals, meat, fish and scrap metal.
"Making and exporting low-tech and agricultural products simply doesn't provide the same opportunities to generate wealth and spin off new industries as do high-tech production and trade," said Kevin L. Kearns, a fellow at the institute.
Some improvement in the trade deficit with Japan reflects the establishment by Japanese industry of manufacturing plants in Southeast Asia. Since 1985, for example, 46 Japanese electronics companies have set up operations in Thailand.
In 1990, the consumer electronics deficit with Japan fell by 8 percent, or $400 million. But United States imports from Thailand totaled $310 million, a 4,326 percent increase over 1988.
Many Democrats and some business officials have been pressing for years for a "results oriented" trade policy, in which the United States and Japan would set targets for trade flows, either for specific industries or over all.
"Recognition that Japan does not behave like the United States, that it has different national interests, and that Government-business cooperation in devising policies deliberately detrimental to American corporations is an accepted part of Japanese policy must be a starting point for thinking about appropriate counter-strategies," said a report delivered two years ago by a group of industry leaders who have been advising the United States trade representative, Carla A. Hills.
The Bush Administration's response was what is known as the Structural Impediments Initiative, a series of negotiations with Japan intended to address the underlying obstacles to fair trade. These included encouraging Japan to improve its distribution system for imported goods and strengthen antitrust enforcement, while Washington undertook to improve American education and reduce the Federal deficit.
Jerry J. Jasinowski, the manufacturers' association president, said it was not the group's intention to blame Japan for the long-term competitive problems of the United States. "It is rather that Japan, more than any other major ally, calls into question some long-standing premises governing America's postwar economic policies, both at home and abroad," he said.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR;
Teheran, Dropping Any Ambiguity, Intensifies Its Drive to Oust Hussein

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANAMA, Bahrain, March 24

 BODY:
Iran is stepping up its campaign to oust President Saddam Hussein of Iraq and the entire leadership of his Baath Socialist Party.
The Teheran Government is supplying Shiite Muslim rebels and Kurdish dissidents in Iraq with more weapons, supplies and moral support in what seems to be a final chapter of the decade-long confrontation between the two Persian Gulf nations. 
 While there was never much good will among the Iranian leaders, whether pragmatists or militants, toward the rulers of Iraq, the country's pragmatic leaders led by President Hashemi Rafsanjani had appeared over the last few months to be advocating the opening of a new chapter in Iraqi-Iranian relations. The idea was to put behind them the enmity engendered by the eight-year war that Iraq started in in September 1980. But now, Iranian policy has sharply changed.
The Teheran radio went so far today as to predict an imminent assault on the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, by rebels "from two axes, north and south." This would include Kurdish rebels from the north and pro-Iranian Shiite Muslims from the south. The broadcast said Baghdad was under siege and "defended by Republican Guards stationed around President Saddam Hussein's residence."
 
Supplying 30,000 Iraqis
 Arab officials in Kuwait and here in Bahrain have said Iran has trained and supplied 30,000 Iraqi dissidents chosen from former prisoners of war held by Iran and from families of Iraqi Shiites evicted from the country 10 years ago. Iran has also said it would confiscate about 150 Iraqi planes that sought refuge in Iran in the recent war over Kuwait.
The distinct shift in the Iranian attitude now is that it unites all elements of the country's ruling establishment, including the rarely heard from but highly influential group of religious scholars. The Government's long-held hope for Iraq is the establishment of a Shiite Muslim leadership there. While fundamentalists would presumably be favored, a more moderate Iraqi Shiite government might also be acceptable in Teheran.
With Iran's long and porous borders with Iraq and with tens of thousands of Iraqi dissidents living as refugees in Iran for nearly a decade, Teheran's renewed threats to Iraq take a new and credible dimension.
Mr. Hussein's leadership -- already isolated in the gulf region, the Arab world, and the world at large -- appears now on the ropes with no friends left.
Turkey, a major regional power in the gulf, as well as several important Arab nations including Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Syria, have said they are opposed to dealing with Mr. Hussein. Even previous supporters, like Jordan, now appear convinced that it is only a matter of time before Mr. Hussein is forcibly removed from power.
The United States and much of Western Europe have made it similarly clear they are looking forward to a new leaderhip in Iraq and will not lift economic sanctions as long as he remains in power.
Still, it is the renewed enmity of Iran that creates the biggest threat to the Iraqi leadership.
What appears to be the latest blunder of the Iraqi leadership has been Mr. Hussein's way of dealing with the most senior Shiite Muslim cleric in Iraq, Ayatollah Abolqassem al-Khoei. That blunder has coalesced Iranians around the goal of bringing him down.
 
'Final Nail in His Coffin'
 On Wednesday Mr. Hussein brought the 91-year-old Ayatollah, who is one of the two most revered figures in the highly politicized world of Shiite Islam, to Baghdad from his native city of Najaf, and had him appear on Iraqi television sitting next to him to express support for the repression of Shiite rebels.
"He may have struck the final nail in his coffin by doing this," said a Shiite Muslim from Bahrain who is an expert on that branch of Islam. "No Shiite in Iran, in the gulf or anywhere else in the world will ever believe that Khoei was not forced to say what he said. Indeed no Muslim will believe it."
"By doing this, Saddam has confirmed the degree to which he is willing to manipulate the highest Islamic values even as his regime is tumbling," the Bahraini said. "He has stepped on what is most precious to the Shiites."
Indeed for Iran, a nation led by a Shiite Muslim revolutionary clergy, the apparent mistreatment of such a senior religious figure has led to a virtual declaration of war against Mr. Hussein's leadership.
 
Iran Had Kept Door Open
 Iran was already supporting the Shiite rebellion in Basra, Karbala and Najaf with supplies of weapons, food and medical help, but in its pragmatic way, was still keeping a door open to Iraq and denying that it stood behind the rebels.
But after the spectacle of Ayatollah Khoei being made to sit next to a man regarded by Iranians as a vicious oppressor, Iran has said it will not rest until Mr. Hussein is gone.
Since 1980, Mr. Hussein had systematically persecuted Shiite leaders in Iraq and condemned many of their leaders to death. Then he tried to paint his invasion of Kuwait as an act that among other things reflected the confrontation of the world of militant Islam against Western imperialism.
On Saturday, Iran's senior cleric, Ayatollah Mohammed Reza Golpaygani, who ranks higher than the Iranian religious leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, called on the world's Muslims to stage protests in mosques to condemn the treatment of Ayatollah Khoei. In a declaration broadcast by the Teheran radio, Ayatollah Golpaygani said the "the forced abduction" of Ayatollah Khoei was an affront to all Muslims.
 
Ayatollah's Aides Abducted
 Iran said the abduction of several senior aides of Ayatollah Khoei from Najaf was also abhorrent. Najaf, which is in Iraq, and Qom, which is in Iran, are considered to be the two centers of Shiite Islamic scholarship.
While the Iraqi leadership has kept Shiite scholars in Najaf under close scrutiny, it had never dared to interfere with Ayatollah Khoei. For his part, the Ayatollah has been restrained in his public comments on subjects other than religion.
Iran's denunciation of this act was its most dramatic gesture since the call by Ayatollah Ruhallah Khomeini for the kiling of the British author Salman Rushdie for what the ayatollah called his blasphemy of Islam in his book "The Satanic Verses." The fact that Ayatollah Golpaygani made the call personally reflects the degree to which Iran objected to Mr. Hussein's move.
If there was any ambivalence among the ruling circles of Iran about the need to pursue the confrontation with Iraq, that event has wiped it out.
Over the last year, Iranian pragmatists like President Rafsanjani pursued a two-track policy toward Iraq, encouraging the making of peace, but also undermining the Iraqi leadership by discreet support for the Shiite Muslim rebels. Now even President Rafsanjani has said the Iraqi leader has to go.
 
Turk Predicts Hussein's Fall
 He is not alone among the regional gulf powers to say so. Today, the Turkish President, Turgut Ozal, said he did not believe that Mr. Hussein or anyone close to him would be in power much longer.
Mr. Ozal told Cable News Network in an interview broadcast today in the United States that "the next man after Saddam is not the second, third, not even 20th" in the Baath Party structure,
Even the Jordanians appeared resigned that a change in Iraq was coming, and maybe necessary.
"Everything in Iraq has changed," Crown Prince Hassan of Jordan in San Francisco said in another CNN interview. "I think ultimately one hopes that the situation will change to a participatory system."
Elsewhere in the Arab world, both President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and King Fahd of Saudi Arabia have stated they will not deal with an Iraq headed by Mr. Hussein.

HEADLINE: Free Trade Fatefully Near For Paraguay's 'Hong Kong'

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CIUDAD DEL ESTE, Paraguay

 BODY:
In this bustling town on the border of Brazil and Argentina, often called the Hong Kong of South America, smugglers fear that their long and lonely advocacy of free trade is about to become respectable.
On Tuesday, the Presidents of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay are to meet in Asuncion, Paraguay's capital, to sign a treaty forming the Southern Cone Common Market. 
 Known as Mercosur, a contraction of its name in Spanish, the market will allow goods and services to circulate tariff free between the 200 million consumers of the region by January 1996.
Brazil and Argentina, the two largest economic players of the region, are to eliminate all tariffs on trade with each other by January 1995. In addition, both countries plan to lower duties on imports from outside the region to an average of 20 percent. In some cases, those tariffs are as high as 100 percent.
Brazil is already the largest importer of goods from the other three nations. Last year, $2 billion worth of goods was traded between Argentina and Brazil.
Chile, which lowered its tariffs in the 1980's, declined to join the common market. Instead, Chile starts talks in May with the United States in the hope of establishing a free-trade agreement.
"It's a world trend toward economies of scale," Celso Amorim, Brazil's common-market negotiator, said in an interview in Brasilia. "It's happening in Europe, the Far East, North America."
On the other side of South America, Venezuela, Colombia, Peru and Bolivia have decided to abolish virtually all regional tariffs by year-end.
Both South American common markets dovetail with a proposal for a Western Hemisphere free-trade zone that was promoted by President Bush during his five-nation tour of South America in December.
This city's practitioners of free trade may be among the first to lose if free trade breaks out in the region.
In a back office of the seedy Lai Lai shopping center here, a Brazilian computer smuggler whose business card identified him only as Marcio said with a mix of apprehension and bravado: "Mercosur would finish off this town -- if it ever happens. But it won't. Brazil's big thing has always been bureaucracy and import duties."
 
The City Protectionism Built
 Indeed, to walk though this town is to see a mirrored reflection of the protectionist economies of Brazil and Argentina, which start on the other side of the Alto Parana River.
Roller skates with pink wheels, Scotch, fishing rods, American potato chips, electronic organs, Taiwanese pocket calculators, Space Laser Gun toys, ersatz Ming vases, cordless telephones, designer-label sneakers, French perfumes, I.B.M. personal computers -- all are on sale here. On the other side of the river, all are considered "contrabanda."
While many countries outlaw imports of illicit drugs, pornography and firearms, Brazil and Argentina banned imports of these and thousands of other consumer goods to foster domestic industry. Items that were not banned outright were kept out with stiff duties, sometimes more than 100 percent.
Indeed, Brazilian and Argentine protectionism built Ciudad del Este, now Paraguay's second-largest city.
"When I arrived here in 1972, there were only 5,000 people and this was mostly forest," Oscar Escobar, a local television reporter, said, surveying the urban sprawl that is now home to 150,000 people.
 
One Big Duty-Free Shop
 To the outrage of Brazil's economic planners, Paraguay's free-market pioneers built this frontier city as one large duty-free shop to cater largely to Sao Paulo, South America's largest city, 600 miles to the east.
In what is now a classic excursion, hundreds of thousands of middle-class Brazilians board buses each year for an overnight trip to Ciudad del Este.
The currencies that flow into cash registers here are American dollars, Brazilian cruzeiros, Argentine australs and Paraguayan guaranis. By nightfall, commerce has usually been so intense that packing materials are ankle deep in the streets. In the evening, the Brazilians either visit the casinos -- there are none in Brazil -- or return home by bus.
Because little is officially exported, import statistics show Paraguay, a largely rural nation of four million people, to be South America's largest per capita consumer of French perfume, American cigarettes and Scotch.
 
End of 'Hong Kong' Position Seen
 Some politicians in Asuncion are predicting that Ciudad del Este will have to adapt to the times.
"Economic integration is never achieved without spilling a little blood," said Guillermo Caballero Vargas, a businessman who is seen as a possible presidential candidate in the 1993 elections. "We can't give up integration with the Southern Cone because of a deformation in one point of the nation. Ciudad del Este has to abandon its position as the Hong Kong of South America."
Paraguay, which has low labor costs and large expanses of fertile land, can develop agriculture, largely soy and cotton. Farm products can be processed cheaply because of virtually limitless amounts of low-cost hydroelectric energy.
 
Central Role Likely for Uruguay
 Uruguay is expected to emerge as a service and financial center for the common market. It has the region's top literacy rate, a strong university system and a tradition as a banking center for Argentines and Brazilians.
For Brazil and Argentina, the common market is expected to provide more sales and foreign investment.
"This is a very positive move which opens up new areas of opportunity," Robert Stone, president of General Motors of Brazil, said in a telephone interview from his factory outside Sao Paulo. Partly with an eye to increasing exports, General Motors recently announced a $1 billion five-year modernization of its production lines in Brazil.

HEADLINE: Rumors Roil Coffee Market

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, March 24

 BODY:
Traders say that one of Brazil's largest coffee exporters profited from inside information about the Government's decision last week to suspend new export sales of coffee, newspapers reported on Saturday.
The exporter, identified by several Brazilian newspapers as Guilherme Ribeiro, denied the accusation in an interview with the newspaper O Estado de Sao Paulo. He said he had not operated for a long time in the New York coffee market, where the inside trades were said to have occurred. 
 Mr. Ribeiro owns two companies, Montenegro Exportacao e Importacao in Sao Paulo, and Irmaos Ribeiro in Santos, a port city. No one could be reached at either company this weekend.
Rumors swept the New York coffee market on Friday that some traders had been buying heavily in advance of Brazil's announcement the day earlier suspending export sales of coffee. On Thursday evening, the Government said it would suspend new export sales while it studied a return to international export quotas to push up prices.
On Friday, coffee for May delivery soared 5 cents a pound, to $1, on the news, but later closed at 93.05 cents a pound, down 1.95 cents.
Brazil's Economy Minister, Zelia Cardoso de Mello, said today that she would support an investigation into the accusations of speculative trading.
On Friday, the Federation of Brazilian Coffee Exporters had called for an investigation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in the United States into what it called suspicious speculative movements in the New York market in the two days before the announcement.

HEADLINE: Poor Are Rocked by Closing of Gynecological Clinics

BYLINE: By NADINE BROZAN

 BODY:
Thousands of low-income women in New York City must now scramble to find routine gynecological care because the clinics where they used to receive it have been closed or scaled back for lack of money -- victims of city budget cuts and economic problems.
Nonprofit agencies are trying to find alternative clinics for these women, but until then the closings may mean no examinations, no counseling, no prescriptions for birth control pills or diaphragms, no Pap smears and no referrals to obstetricians or for abortions. 
 The closing of subsidized clinics in New York is an extreme example of a national trend, said Thomas C. Kring, a former president of the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association, which represents about 1,000 providers of gynecological care.
"Providers have been tightening their belts and trying to combine services rather than totally close them off, because they must operate with less money than they had in 1980, when Ronald Reagan took office," Mr. Kring said in a telephone interview from his Los Angeles office, where he is director of the California Family Planning Council, a nonprofit agency that administers Federal family-planning funds. In 1980, the Federal budget for family planning was $162 million; in 1990, it was $144 million.
"Nationwide, there are 1,000 fewer clinics providing subsidized services than there were in 1980," down from about 5,000, said Mr. Kring, who added that the number of patients getting subsidized care dropped to four million last year from five million in 1980.
 The clinic closings in New York illustrate how government budget gaps, often discussed in abstract terms, can disrupt the lives of ordinary people.
Three publicly financed family-planning clinics serving about 10,000 women -- in Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens -- were closed this month. The one in Manhattan was merged with another nearby.
The closings have come at a stressful time for such subsidized clinics. Some have become the only source of medical care for many low-income women, and all are having to broaden their services beyond birth control and prenatal care. Now they are increasingly testing for AIDS and handling growing numbers of teen-age pregnancies.
At the same time, several thousand more New York City women also lost a source of routine gynecological care this month when Planned Parenthood of New York City discontinued providing such services at its only Manhattan clinic. Again, the reason was financial. Now women seeking pill prescriptions, diaphragms, testing and other services are referred to Planned Parenthood clinics in Brooklyn and the Bronx.
Helena Greer, a 27-year-old mother of four, has received gynecological care for 13 years at the Qualicap Clinic in Long Island City, Queens. The other day, she heard that it had closed.
Now Ms. Greer wonders where she, her three sisters and her many friends in the neighborhood will go. "There is nothing else like it around here, especially not for teens." said Ms. Greer, who began using the clinic when she was 14. "It was free for people without Medicaid. Now I think that pregnancy among teens will get really bad."
The Qualicap Clinic and the others that have closed were operated by the Community Family Planning Council, a nonprofit voluntary agency that gets 46 percent of its financing from the city's Human Resources Administration. The rest of its budget comes from state, Federal and private sources.
 
Alternative Sources of Care
 In January, the H.R.A., facing budget cutbacks, announced that it would cut its $3.5 million grant to the family-planning council by $1 million this year and by almost $2.3 million next year.
As a result, the council closed Qualicap, at 42-15 Crescent Street in Long Island City, and two more of its 12 centers; the Action for Progress clinic at 92-94 Ludlow Street on the Lower East Side of Manhattan and the Coney Island Clinic at 2836 West 23d Street in Brooklyn. The Lower East Side center was merged with another at 191 Canal Street in Chinatown.
But administrators are still trying to find alternative sources of care for the patients in Brooklyn and Queens.
The three clinics to be closed were chosen because they were in areas with relatively lower rates of teen-age pregnancy and infant mortality, said Ana O. Dumois, the council's executive director. In addition, she said, "we didn't want to close clinics in boroughs with only one of our facilities, such as the Bronx and Staten Island."
The Manhattan Borough President, Ruth W. Messinger, said she was trying to restore some of the money cut from the Community Family Planning Council's grant so the Lower East Side clinic could reopen.
"This program is an investment in preventive services," Ms. Messinger said as she dropped by the Chinatown center the other day to see how the merger was going. "If you don't allow people the choice not to have children, and if you don't provide quality care early in pregnancy, then you end up paying for additional hospital costs for sick mothers, low-birth-weight babies and for the economic dependency and substantial poverty that will haunt some of these families for decades."
Dr. Dumois said that if some of the expected cuts were not restored in next year's allocation, "we may have to close two to three more clinics."
"If we have to go into another series of cuts," Dr. Dumois said, "then we will have to go into neighborhoods where infant mortality, low birth weight, teen-age pregnancy and HIV infection are among the highest."
 
A Question of Money
 At Planned Parenthood of New York City, the Margaret Sanger Center in Manhattan discontinued its routine family-planning and gynecological care this month and will now restrict its services to more technically complex and lucrative procedures. The center, at 380 Second Avenue near 22d Street, is Planned Parenthood's only clinic in Manhattan.
Many clients are working women who can afford its fees but not the fees of private gynecologists, many of whom do not accept Medicaid. Other clients are on public assistance. In either case, the Sanger Center's patients are now being referred to Planned Parenthood centers in Brooklyn and the Bronx for contraceptive counseling, physical examinations, Pap tests and treatment for all sexually transmitted diseases but AIDS. The Sanger Center recorded 7,500 visits for contraceptives in 1989, the last year for which data was available, and 1,800 for sexually transmitted diseases.
Now the clinic is concentrating on colposcopy, the examination of the cervix by microscope, and cryotherapy, the removal of lesions on the cervix by freezing. Abortions, HIV testing and counseling and intrauterine device insertion will continue to be available.
Alexander C. Sanger, the new president of Planned Parenthood of New York City, said changing the mission of the Manhattan center that bears his grandmother's name was "not something I came here to do."
On the horizon for Planned Parenthood and other organizations is the prospect that the United States Supreme Court may uphold rules that bar programs receiving Federal money from mentioning abortion as a choice for patients. An injunction has prevented the rules from being enforced until the court decides, but Planned Parenthood says that if the regulations are upheld, it will cease taking Federal funds rather than comply.
So far, budget cuts have not affected other programs that offer family-planning services to low-income and welfare patients in the city -- 11 acute-care municipal hospitals and five neighborhood primary care centers run by the Health and Hospitals Corporation.
Appropriations by both the Federal and state government for family planning have remained more or less constant in the last few years, but clinic directors say the failure to keep pace with inflation has in fact led them to stretch their services thin.
"Everyone is having to retrench, at a time of inflation and at a time when they are having to add new services," said Shirley Gordon, executive director of Family Planning Advocates, an association of 140 clinics in New York State. She said clinics were being asked to deal with sharp rises in sexually transmitted diseases and more cases of cervical cancer and adolescent pregnancy.
The combination of factors is leaving many women without the gynecological care they had been used to. Donna Charles, 31, a bank clerk and former patient at the shuttered clinic on the Lower East Side, made the best of the situation the other day during her first appointment in the Chinatown center.
"I can't go anywhere else," she said. "I can't afford anything else. But I am glad to see some of the same staff here. I would follow these people wherever they are. I am not a stranger here."

The Economy
A wave of new taxes and tax increases appears to be developing in states, counties and cities. The trend, the third wave of local taxes since the 1930's, shows up in the many taxes enacted last year or proposed for 1991. It is reflected in bitter debates over essential public services and it is seen in the willingness of three states without an income tax to consider one. [Page A1.] 

 New orders for machine tools show surprising strength. The orders are often an important weathervane for the economy because the equipment is used by a wide range of manufacturers. [D1.] Spurred by higher demand from domestic companies, new orders for U.S. machine tools jumped 27.7 percent last month. [D7.]
The Supreme Court will decide who should hear a discrimination case filed by a brokerage executive who lost his job. Although the case concerns the long-established arbitration procedures of the securities industry, civil rights advocates say what is at stake is far more fundamental: a worker's right to sue for discrimination.

HEADLINE: Bias Lawsuit Jolts Suburb Widely Cited As Integrated

BYLINE: By JAMES FERON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW ROCHELLE, March 22

 BODY:
Whatever else New Rochelle has done, or failed to do, in the postwar decades of suburban expansion, integration of its minority residents is considered a major success. So when four residents filed a lawsuit last week charging that the city's election system discriminated against blacks, many in this suburban city were startled.
House-hunting for blacks transferred to the metropolitan area often begins here because, as a bank executive said, "The mix is good." 
 But apparently not good enough to produce more than one black City Councilman, Joseph Evans, in the city's history. Mr. Evans was appointed to the five-member Council in 1965 and went on to win election twice.
Blacks, who represent 18 percent of New Rochelle's population, have been disenfranchised, contends the suit filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan, because election to the Council is at-large, or citywide, which tends to favor the white majority, rather than from districts.
 
'System Should Be Changed'
 During an era when many Northeastern cities have been touched by racial strife, New Rochelle has long been known as one of the New York metropolitan region's best integrated cities. Its neighbor to the west, Mount Vernon, has a much larger black community, representing 55 percent of the city's population. But it is essentially divided from the predominantly white community by the Metro-North Commuter Railroad line, which cuts the city in half.
Farther to the west of New Rochelle, Yonkers, with a 13 percent black population concentrated on the west side of the city, has had its share of racial discord. Yonkers is under Federal court orders to build 200 units of low-cost housing at seven sites on the east side of the city.
Still, Edward O. Howard, a black lawyer who lives in Rochelle Heights, an integrated community in the city, said this week in an interview that more needed to be done. "Black candidates are not known, generally, outside their neighborhood," he said. "We're not a ghettoized community, nor is New Rochelle racially polarized, but the system should be changed."
Kim Christensen, an assistant professor of economics at the State University of New York at Purchase and a New Rochelle resident, agreed, saying that "every group needs to have its views heard." Professor Christensen, who is white, lives "in a neighborhood that has Hispanics, whites and blacks -- possibly 60 or 70 percent white."
 
Concentration of Blacks
 According to the 1990 Census, New Rochelle's population is 67,160, down 5 percent from the 1980 total of 70,794. Blacks also declined in numbers, and in nearly similar proportion, from 12,689 in 1980 to 12,166, or 4 percent. The city's fastest-growing population is Hispanic, doubling in size from 3,800 in 1980 to 7,200 today.
Black residents, while represented in every neighborhood, are concentrated in a central belt that has City Hall, coincidentally, at its center. Two of every three New Rochelle blacks live in that area, fulfilling one of the "threshold" conditions that mark successful prosecution of Voting Rights Act cases.
Some blacks argue that if the Council members were elected from districts, a black candidate might have a good chance of winning in the neighborhood where black voters are concentrated.
Randolph Scott-McLaughlin, an associate law professor at the Pace University Law School who helped the Center for Constitutional Rights prepare its case against New Rochelle, said, "There have been more than 60 such suits, mostly in the South, and we know what the U.S. Supreme Court looks for in these cases."
"They want to know if the minority community is both politically and geographically cohesive," he said. "If it has no political clubs, no N.A.A.C.P., it probably won't support a minority candidate. Similarly the Court wants to know if a district can be formed with a 65 percent minority population. A city that is perfectly integrated could not form such a district."
 
At-Large Elections Defended
 The center sued the city, the Council and the County Board of Elections on behalf of these black residents: Ossie Davis, the actor; Napoleon Holmes, head of the New Rochelle chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People; Wilhelmena Strong, a public-school teacher, and Paul D. Dennis, director of the New Rochelle Youth Bureau.
Ruth Kitchen, a Democratic Council member, defends at-large elections, saying that dividing the city into districts "will polarize the city, forcing Council members to think first of their home district and secondly of the city."
"It is untrue that blacks cannot be elected," Ms. Kitchen said. "A black Democrat who ran with me in the last election lost to a Republican only by the margin of his opponent's Conservative Party vote. Also, election to the Board of Education is citywide, and two of its nine members are black."
New Rochelle is far from perfectly integrated, and Edward Coll, a clothing industry executive, finds that situation satisfactory. Standing at the city's refurbished train station, he said: "New Rochelle is a suburb, but it provides a view of urban life. Our children have gained a lot from living here."
Karin Battersby and Fran Oliver, friends at the high school, find a measure of pride in their racial differences. "It makes a difference; it makes you open-minded," said Karin, who is white. Fran, who is black, said, "It's the real world."
Robert D. Kuklis, principal of the high school, said white students represented 58 percent of last year's graduating class, black 28 percent, Hispanic 8 percent and "rising," and Asian 7 percent.
 
A Suburban Prototype
 For generations, New Rochelle was the prototypical suburb. George M. Cohan set his musical "Forty-Five Minutes From Broadway" in New Rochelle, where he lived. Rob and Laura Petrie, the family depicted in television's long-running "Dick Van Dyke Show," lived in New Rochelle.
But the glitter of the "Queen City of the Sound," as it was known, has faded somewhat over the years. Local merchants were unable to compete with the easy shopping in outlying malls and were further depressed to see New Rochelle companies moving to campus-like settings elsewhere.
New Rochelle is now 31 minutes (and $114 a month) from Grand Central Terminal by Metro-North, and the city is a lot more sophisticated than Mr. Cohan saw it in the song that is better known for its title, "Forty-Five Minutes From Broadway," than for its verses:
 
If you want to find a real hick delegation
The place where the real reubens dwell
Just hop on a train at Grand Central Station
And get off when they shout "New Rochelle."

HEADLINE: Outdoors: Free-Spirited Search for Shad

BYLINE: By PETER KAMINSKY

 BODY:
WHEN I took up fly fishing I was captivated by Charles Waterman's written accounts of shad fishing on Florida's St. Johns River.
It seemed such a free spirited and adventuresome kind of angling. All you had to do was throw a couple of flies in your box and head for the river and never mind the gators and moccasins. 
 This year my annual visit coincided with the peak of the spawning run that sends the shad up the rivers of the East Coast. The shad enter the St. Johns during February and March. The peak of the run comes as spring weather warms the water. Reports had them in the St. Johns as far as Puzzle Lake (northwest of Cape Canaveral), where high water and strong currents had produced good angling.
My guide was my longtime fishing companion, Jack Allen of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., a premier flyrod angler who specializes in Everglades bass. We left well before first light.
The endless malls and condos flew by, shrouded in ground mist as we sliced up I-95. In his big old yellow Chevy, trailering a scarred but well cared for square stern canoe, Allen kept up his end of the fishing dialogue broken only by a lengthy digression on the genius of Johnny Mercer's lyrics.
We headed west on State Road 46 across the wide prairie formed by the meanders of the St. Johns. We put in just downstream of Puzzle Lake. The morning stillness was broken by the sounds of a large truck and trailer which sped into the parking lot like something out of "Road Warrior."
The driver informed us that he was a commercial eel fisherman, like his father before him. With the economy of motion of a man whose livelihood depends on making good use of his time on the water, he worked as he spoke and within minutes, he was gone.
We were the first anglers. We looped around the lazy bends of the river. Side channels invited us, but Allen knew from experience that we would find shad on a certain undercut bank on a narrow stretch of river. We beached our boat at the outlet of a small feeder stream. The light from the east cast a golden net on the green fields of the flood plain.
Allen gave me a four weight rod on which he had fitted a six weight line. "Overlining" is one of his favorite techniques. It affords the angler the pleasant feel of working a light rod, while the extra weight in the line minimizes false casting and delivers a heavy bug over distance.
I walked along the bank. There were no obstacles in the way of my backcast. Grazing cattle had mown the lawn very nicely. On the far bank, up against the reeds, feeding bass smacked the surface. They broke my concentration the way an insistent child can make you put down a book.
But we were rigged for shad on the bottom, not bass on the surface. The air was dead calm. We would have three hours before the morning wind from the ocean reached us. I put the bass out of my mind and cast, 60 feet straight across the channel.
The heavy shad fly hit with a plunk and swung around in the current. On the third or fourth cast, just as the fly finished its swing I felt the tap tap of fish. He bent the rod and fought well in the current, taking line from the reel. I landed the shad, a 2-pounder and released him. I worked my way downstream and, within an hour, had taken four. I felt flush.
We continued upstream to see if there were any other likely holes. The breeze stiffened and the water was, in Allen's words, "rough as a cob." We came upon some perfect holding water. We jumped on the bank and fought through thigh-high muck to get off a cast, but no matter how we turned the wind was coming straight at us. So much for placid, easy fly fishing. An eight weight flyrod will handle windy conditions. Sink tips seem to be favored over full sinking lines. The shad flies should be gaudy and weighted.
We slogged back to the boat. For the next two hours, as we followed the switchbacks of the river, the wind parried our every move. I wondered why there were no carcasses of spent shad in the river.
Up north they fairly blanket the stream bottom. A local fisherman with whom we struck up a chat, explained: each year when the shad come up the stream, some thousands of sea-going white pelicans follow them. No sooner do the shad finish creating their next generation than the huge white birds descend and devour them.
The relentless wind had driven every fly fisherman on the river back to the stretch of bank where I had found success that morning. It was the only place that offered a lee. So for the balance of the afternoon, about a dozen of us strung ourselves up and down the bank. Once or twice I looked up to see a bend in the rod of the angler furthest downstream, signaling the upstream advance of a new pod of shad. One by one we would hook into a fish until the whole dozen of us had a shad on.
Walking up and down the bank, trading flies and stories, we had a nice streamside party going. One angler, a novice fly fisherman, outcaught the rest of us by a long shot. He never stopped smiling and he and his buddy kept up the running banter that comes so happily when you have a fish on the line.
Since he wasn't the world's greatest caster, we all assumed it was just a matter of his having positioned himself at just the right spot at just the right time. I put our theory to the test when the happy fisherman reeled up at five o'clock. Just as soon as he headed downstream I positioned myself exactly where he was standing. I cast exactly where he had cast and I continued there for half an hour. I never had a nibble.

HEADLINE: Sore Winners

 BODY:
Dovish Democrats have been brooding and bristling as Republicans crow about Commander in Chief Bush's bold victory in the Persian Gulf. Most G.O.P. politicians have had the good grace not to disparage the opposition. They believe, correctly, that Mr. Bush will reap the fruits of victory and that a divisive debate won't help his cause.
But a few sore winners have sought partisan advantage. With 20-20 hindsight, they accuse doves of pusillanimous pessimism, of lacking the guts to take on a blustering bully and the smarts to trust the brave allied forces. 
 The accusations sting. But they miss the thrust of the doves' objections, which were honestly stated. And they ignore the fact that the Administration itself -- including the generals who planned and executed the war -- feared that it would be long and costly. While hawks taunt doves with I-told-you-so's, the top brass is more circumspect.
When the proposal to dispatch troops was first broached, the Joint Chiefs of Staff voiced doubts. How well would U.S. men and materiel stand up to the battle-hardened Iraqis and the desert heat? How long would the public tolerate a war that could last months? "All the Chiefs understand," said a four-star general in August, "that the United States is an impatient country."
Intelligence analysts put Iraqi strength at 516,000 in the Kuwaiti theater. That turns out to have been an overestimate. The 100,000 Iraqi desertions before the ground war began in earnest vastly exceeded the most optimistic forecasts.
To avoid engaging so large a force head on, General Schwarzkopf backed the "hail Mary play" -- going deep into Iraq to cut off the Iraqis in Kuwait. After some restless nights, he tried to delay its execution. Had the Iraqis detected the preparations and counterattacked, they could have inflicted heavy losses and prolonged the war.
Defense Secretary Cheney warned that Iraqi forces had chemical arms. General Schwarzkopf took the threat seriously enough to have troops don protective gear. Even now generals wonder why Iraq did not use gas to slow down the allies.
Early on the Pentagon expected 40,000 U.S.casualties. Just before the ground war began, the estimate was lowered to 5,000. Jiggling the numbers up or down can provide a rationale for reinforcements or a go-ahead for attack. And doubtless, there was some poor-mouthing. But field officers remain amazed at how many allied advances were uncontested and how few Americans fell.
The same was true of the air war. Air Force Chief of Staff Merrill McPeak projected losses of "four or five aircraft a day" in the deliberations leading up to the war. His "private hunch" was less than that. But "even in my . . . wildest dreams," he said, "I would not have said we would lose one aircraft every three days in this kind of operation."
Inevitably, the doves were influenced by this official pessimism. They had other concerns as well. For example, they felt U.S. interests were vital enough to justify force only as a last resort and that the less risky alternative of economic sanctions had yet to be fully tested. The war mooted the issue. But hawks who were quick to say in January that sanctions alone wouldn't disarm Iraq and drive Saddam Hussein from power are now relying on sanctions to complete those aims.
Doves also doubted that war would create the stable Middle East that the U.S. sought. That issue remains in doubt as the troops remain in place, civil war rends Iraq and the peace process sputters. Until all the results are in, faulting the doves for these diplomatic misgivings is premature.
The generals themselves had little reason to believe that a short war was a sure thing. Knowing that, the doves preferred a strategy of patient pressure. Mr. Bush's quick resort to force worked out well. That may make the doves politically vulnerable, but it doesn't make them dishonorable.

HEADLINE: For Yugoslavia, Unity Still Holds Best Hope;
Neighborly Support

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"On the Edge, in the Lands That Wrote the Book" (The Week in Review, March 3), on Balkanization in the Balkans, couldn't be further off the mark. You state that "nobody outside Yugoslavia is prepared to welcome its separate parts into the European family," but neighboring western and eastern European nations have been giving both Slovenia and Croatia unofficial support.
Countries such as Austria, Germany, Hungary and Czechoslovakia have much to gain by establishment of free and independent democracies in Slovenia and Croatia, with their thriving free-market economies. Slovenia and Croatia, with long historical and cultural ties to these nations, have received vital good will, moral support, favorable news media coverage and other unofficial support from private institutions in those countries. 
 Indeed, Hungary's large sale of automatic weapons to the government of Croatia last fall helped this struggling republic preserve its hard-won democracy by standing up to the Communist Yugoslav army. Unfortunately, this army, whose officer corps is 70 percent Serbian, is the last functioning federal institution in Yugoslavia, through which Communist-ruled Serbia can extend its heavy grip over the other democratic republics.
Clearly, Yugoslavia, and its main champion, Serbia, are finding themselves increasingly more isolated in the international community because of this Serb-controlled army intimidation, because of Serbian repression of Albanians in Kosovo and because of recent Serbian abuse of the federal banking system. Even the International Monetary Fund recently suspended all negotiations with Yugoslavia on monetary aid until this internal turmoil settles.
And even more clearly, the continued existence of Yugoslavia, as it is constituted today, is not in the best interest of Yugoslavia's neighbors. For that matter, it is not in the best long-term interest of the United States either. When push comes to shove in Yugoslavia soon, those European countries will support the democracies in Slovenia and Croatia. So should we.

Still, Edward O. Howard, a black lawyer who lives in Rochelle Heights, an integrated community in the city, said this week in an interview that more needed to be done. "Black candidates are not known, generally, outside their neighborhood," he said. "We're not a ghettoized community, nor is New Rochelle racially polarized, but the system should be changed."
Kim Christensen, an assistant professor of economics at the State University of New York at Purchase and a New Rochelle resident, agreed, saying that "every group needs to have its views heard." Professor Christensen, who is white, lives "in a neighborhood that has Hispanics, whites and blacks -- possibly 60 or 70 percent white."
 
Concentration of Blacks
 According to the 1990 Census, New Rochelle's population is 67,160, down 5 percent from the 1980 total of 70,794. Blacks also declined in numbers, and in nearly similar proportion, from 12,689 in 1980 to 12,166, or 4 percent. The city's fastest-growing population is Hispanic, doubling in size from 3,800 in 1980 to 7,200 today.
Black residents, while represented in every neighborhood, are concentrated in a central belt that has City Hall, coincidentally, at its center. Two of every three New Rochelle blacks live in that area, fulfilling one of the "threshold" conditions that mark successful prosecution of Voting Rights Act cases.
Some blacks argue that if the Council members were elected from districts, a black candidate might have a good chance of winning in the neighborhood where black voters are concentrated.
Randolph Scott-McLaughlin, an associate law professor at the Pace University Law School who helped the Center for Constitutional Rights prepare its case against New Rochelle, said, "There have been more than 60 such suits, mostly in the South, and we know what the U.S. Supreme Court looks for in these cases."
"They want to know if the minority community is both politically and geographically cohesive," he said. "If it has no political clubs, no N.A.A.C.P., it probably won't support a minority candidate. Similarly the Court wants to know if a district can be formed with a 65 percent minority population. A city that is perfectly integrated could not form such a district."
 
At-Large Elections Defended
 The center sued the city, the Council and the County Board of Elections on behalf of these black residents: Ossie Davis, the actor; Napoleon Holmes, head of the New Rochelle chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People; Wilhelmena Strong, a public-school teacher, and Paul D. Dennis, director of the New Rochelle Youth Bureau.
Ruth Kitchen, a Democratic Council member, defends at-large elections, saying that dividing the city into districts "will polarize the city, forcing Council members to think first of their home district and secondly of the city."
"It is untrue that blacks cannot be elected," Ms. Kitchen said. "A black Democrat who ran with me in the last election lost to a Republican only by the margin of his opponent's Conservative Party vote. Also, election to the Board of Education is citywide, and two of its nine members are black."
New Rochelle is far from perfectly integrated, and Edward Coll, a clothing industry executive, finds that situation satisfactory. Standing at the city's refurbished train station, he said: "New Rochelle is a suburb, but it provides a view of urban life. Our children have gained a lot from living here."
Karin Battersby and Fran Oliver, friends at the high school, find a measure of pride in their racial differences. "It makes a difference; it makes you open-minded," said Karin, who is white. Fran, who is black, said, "It's the real world."
Robert D. Kuklis, principal of the high school, said white students represented 58 percent of last year's graduating class, black 28 percent, Hispanic 8 percent and "rising," and Asian 7 percent.
 
A Suburban Prototype
 For generations, New Rochelle was the prototypical suburb. George M. Cohan set his musical "Forty-Five Minutes From Broadway" in New Rochelle, where he lived. Rob and Laura Petrie, the family depicted in television's long-running "Dick Van Dyke Show," lived in New Rochelle.
But the glitter of the "Queen City of the Sound," as it was known, has faded somewhat over the years. Local merchants were unable to compete with the easy shopping in outlying malls and were further depressed to see New Rochelle companies moving to campus-like settings elsewhere.
New Rochelle is now 31 minutes (and $114 a month) from Grand Central Terminal by Metro-North, and the city is a lot more sophisticated than Mr. Cohan saw it in the song that is better known for its title, "Forty-Five Minutes From Broadway," than for its verses:
 
If you want to find a real hick delegation
The place where the real reubens dwell
Just hop on a train at Grand Central Station
And get off when they shout "New Rochelle."

HEADLINE: WASHINGTON TALK;
The Field Is Still Open, Time Wanes And, as in '88, the Name Gore Arises

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 21

 BODY:
Fire in the belly is a rare commodity among Democrats these days.
Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia says he most definitely lacks it. Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas has left many Democrats wondering. Even Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the House majority leader and a man with a clear case of Presidential ambition, seems to be trying to dampen speculation about his plans. 
 The party, as a whole, seems to be struggling to work up its enthusiasm for a Presidential campaign against a popular incumbent coming off a popular war. In such a climate, ambition can seem a virtue and unblinking confidence on an unlined face is not automatically dismissed as hubris. And Senator Al Gore stands out.
Fire in the belly? "I guess because I ran before, I will always be suspect of having that fire," says the Democrat from Tennessee. "And I will not deny that."
 
No Decision Yet
 Mr. Gore, whose 1988 campaign for the Democratic nomination sputtered out in the New York primary, says he has not made a decision on whether to seek the Presidency in 1992. But the interest is clearly there, and some Democrats argue that the moment is ripe for the 42-year-old Senator.
The field is virtually wide open. The party is slightly panicked as the weeks go by and the most visible standard-bearers are still George S. McGovern, the 1972 nominee who lost 49 states, and Paul E. Tsongas, the former Senator from Massachusetts.
What particularly intrigues the oddsmakers in Democratic politics is a simple fact: Mr. Gore is inoculated on the one issue that has tormented his party in recent weeks. He was one of just 10 Democratic Senators to vote in favor of the resolution authorizing war in the Persian Gulf. Almost every other potential Democratic contender voted or spoke against it.
As Carter Eskew, a Democratic political consultant and friend of Mr. Gore, puts it: Mr. Gore could run "without the constant noise, the nyah-nyah-nyah-nyah-nyah, on the gulf."
No one knows how long the Persian Gulf issue will last in the Presidential campaign. No one suggests it is a rationale for a Presidential candidacy. But for now, at least, the issue that has devastated men like Mr. Nunn has shed an attractive new light on Mr. Gore.
"I think Al is positioned extremely well," said Nathan Landow, chairman of the Maryland Democratic Party and leader of a group of financial contributors who rallied behind Mr. Gore in 1988.
The question, for many of Mr. Gore's supporters, is whether a candidacy in 1992 would further his goal of being President one day. If an ambitious young Democrat won the nomination but lost the election against Mr. Bush, as is widely expected, would that candidate be repudiated by his party? Or would he emerge well-positioned for 1996, a tested warrior for a grateful party?
Mr. Gore, of course, does not mention such tactical considerations when asked about the factors he weighs. Sipping tea in his office, surrounded by mementoes of a life in politics, including his own "Doonesbury" story line spoofing his privileged background and youthful chutzpah through the character "Prince Albert," Mr. Gore begins with a disclaimer -- that he does not seek to use this interview to sketch campaign themes or advance a candidacy.
"I have not yet reached the stage where I'm going to make the decision on whether I'm going to run," he says. "But I have very strong beliefs about what this country needs to do, what we as a people need to do."
He recites the Democratic litany of unmet needs. "On the side of running," he says, "I think this country is feeling the Reagan-Bush years and needs to approach domestic problems like the economy, competitiveness, the environment, crime, with a sense of determination and with leadership and with 'the vision thing.' "
On the other side of the scales, he says, are personal considerations. Having run before, he says, "It's a lot harder for me to deceive myself about what it really means to make a two-year campaign for President. The last time I fooled myself into thinking that I would see my family one or two days a week, or that the children could take turns coming out on the road. I don't believe that now, because I know that, when the campaign starts, you almost have to say goodbye to your wife and children for the duration."
 
Concerns for Family
 Mr. Gore and his wife, Tipper, who gained her own prominence as a critic of obscenity in rock music lyrics, have three daughters, ages 12, 13 and 17, and a son, Albert 3d.
"My son, who is the youngest in the family, is only eight years old, and he's already been through one Presidential campaign, and more," the Senator said. Two years ago, while Mr. Gore was attending a Baltimore Orioles baseball game with his son, the boy broke away and was hit by a car. His injuries were serious, his recovery long.
For all of that, Mr. Gore has long shown all of the symptoms of a common senatorial syndrome: Sooner or later, senators look in a mirror and see a President.
The Harvard-educated son of a prominent Senator, Albert Gore Sr., Mr. Gore crossed that threshold at the age of 39. He jumped into the 1988 campaign for the Democratic nomination, positioning himself as the Southern candidate in a year when the South was supposed to play a critical role in choosing the nominee. It did not.
Mr. Gore careered from message to message, theme to theme, from Southern populism to Gary Hart-style "new generation" politics. He offered himself as the Democrat who was tough on foreign policy, the favorite son of a proud South, the Democrat who was willing to confront the Rev. Jesse Jackson.
He did well on Super Tuesday, the round of Southern primaries on March 8, but his campaign seemed to have no coherent strategy for the day after, when the race rolled back into the North. He withdrew after finishing a distant third in New York.
"He was a very young guy running for President for the first time," said one veteran Democratic strategist.
His critics, and there were many, said his campaign was all about positioning and a search for short-term tactical advantage. Mr. Gore still bristles at the notion that his national security stance was a matter of campaign positioning: "I had a career in the House for eight years and four years in the Senate before I ran for President."
But he adds, with a slight laugh, "I've begun to suspect that I made some mistakes in that campaign. And if that hypothesis is proven out, one of them might be that I didn't do a very good job of articulating and staying with the core beliefs that motivated my decision to run."
Mr. Gore also offers some self-deprecating humor to defuse another charge from the 1988 campaign. "The story I remember from that campaign is: How can you tell Al Gore from a room full of Secret Service agents? And the answer is: He's the stiff one."
The political damage from his 1988 Presidential campaign was less extensive than many predicted. He retired his debt quickly. He handily won re-election to the Senate last fall. While his rhetoric in New York was hot -- he said of Mr. Jackson, "We're not choosing a preacher, we're choosing a President," and his most prominent supporter in New York, Edward I. Koch, who was then Mayor, denounced Mr. Jackson repeatedly -- Mr. Jackson says today, "We have a good rapport, mutual respect."
 
Experience Will Count
 Democratic strategists say the experience of a past Presidential campaign is invaluable. "What Gore has this time is the greatest single asset someone brings to running for President, and that is that he's run before," one strategist said.
Mr. Gore says: "When I run again, whenever that is, assuming that I do, I will spend a lot more time focusing on the priorities that I believe important day in and day out, and a lot less time running from one event to another, keeping in the traveling roadshow that develops in these things."
Mr. Gore has kept working on his pet causes, particularly the environment and global warming. He is writing a book, which he declines to discuss, and has continued to write opinion pieces and guest columns.
Mr. Gore's position on the gulf war vote has made him one of the few Democrats able to take the offensive in recent weeks, as Republicans began to hammer the Democrats for their votes. He took the floor of the Senate this month and declared, "Shame on those Republican operatives for playing politics with American lives, for the disservice they do to the brave American soldiers who made the ultimate sacrifice for their country."
He has begun calling, as he did this morning on the NBC News television program "Meet the Press," for an effort on domestic ills to match the American effort in the gulf, an echo of the old Democratic tradition of aggressive foreign and domestic policy.
"The world as a whole has chosen, with few exceptions, democracy and capitalism as the wave of the future," he said. "And we need to come out and say, here's how we perfect those. But the Democratic Party, in addition, says, let's fight for those values here at home -- our job isn't finished yet."
The dance is beginning again.
"Let's go through a little ritual," said Garrick Utley, the show's host. "I'm going to ask you a question and you're going to give me a straight answer, right? Are you going to run for President?"
Al Gore smiled and said, "I haven't decided yet."

HEADLINE: Careers;
Recruiters Expand Into Outplacement

BYLINE: By Elizabeth M. Fowler

 BODY:
CONFUSION, growing competition and even financial problems abound in two career-oriented service businesses, management recruiting and outplacement. This affects another group, management consulting.
Russell Reynolds Inc, and Korn/ Ferry International, large management recruiting concerns, have cut staffs because of the hiring downturn. Korn/Ferry, among others, has announced broader services such as a new unit to provide executive compensation advice, which takes it into fierce competition with management consultants that specialize in human resource planning, like Hewitt Associates and Towers Perrin. 
 At the same time outplacement concerns say business is good but complain about rising expenses because it takes much longer for displaced managers to find jobs -- eight months reported by some compared with six months last year and a mere three months or less during prosperous years in the 1980's. That means increased costs for expensive counseling, office space and clerical help.
Even so, some recruiters hungrily eye the outplacement field, and more and more -- like the Winchester Group, in San Mateo, Calif., and People Management Northeast, in Simsbury, Conn. -- have already entered it.
"The associations for both groups see it as conflict of interest; I see it as an apparent conflict and I vote for purity," James H. Kennedy said last week. A perennial critic, he is the publisher of newletters and directories on outplacement, recruiting and management consulting.
"Let's see where the conflict is," he added. "There might be double-dipping for fees if an outplaced person is placed in a job through the management recruiting arm of a firm. Some say, 'We don't put the scoop in all the way -- we take a reduced fee.' "
Janet Jones-Parker, former executive director of the Association of Executive Search Consultants Inc., recently joined A. T. Kearney Inc., better known as a management consulting concern, in its management recruiting unit in Stamford, Conn.
She agrees with Mr. Kennedy. "I don't think firms can do both activities well because executive search is so specialized," she said. She added that the earnings decline of many recruiting concerns could be attributed partly to being "locked into a high overhead if they operate in cities like New York."
"My strategy for a search firm," she said, "would be to have a few strong business generators in New York, where rents are high -- four or five at a maximum, who can bring in $500,000 in fees yearly, and more offices elsewhere."
Search fees run about 33 percent of a recruited executive's pay, or $33,000 for a $100,000-a-year and $82,500 for a $250,000-a-year executive. Fees are paid by companies.
Robert M. Hecht of Lee Hecht Harrison, a large outplacement concern, agrees that more and more recruiting firms are expanding into outplacement, but he believes they are in for "a rude awakening" financially. Outplacement fees run only about 15 percent of the displaced person's salary.
"They claim the two functions never overlap," he said, "but I am not so sure that is true or that it is even desirable to operate in both areas. I am not sure that a management recruiting boutique that specializes has the resources to hire the right people for effective outplacement."
"We are in a different business," he added. "Outplacment counselors must have a different mental set. The amount of time, effort and caring attitude involved is monumental. We are continually racing against a psychic clock ticking away an outplaced client's individual esteem and his relations with family. There is trauma involved and we have to provide crisis intervention."
While management recruiting concerns regard outplacement as a way to expand, outplacement firms also look outward. Some, like Mr. Hecht's, are setting up divisions to advise on career renewal, retirement planning and career management for companies, functions of many management consulting firms.
Andrew Sherwood noted that his firm, the Goodrich & Sherwood Company, started in 1971 as a management recruiting firm and added outplacement in 1976. As a contented fence straddler he has a good overview. "For the last three years our recruiting business has grown maybe 1 percent a year," he said. "In other words, it is about flat, but outplacement has grown 100 percent each of those years. I would say that the management recruiting business has slowed partly because outplacement has done such a good job."
Techniques have become so sophisticated that often displaced persons can through networking reach specific companies seeking new managers before the company hires an outside recruiter. "That saves the companies money," Mr. Sherwood said.

HEADLINE: Little-Known Carlyle Scores Big

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
For weeks, Prince al-Waleed bin Talal of Saudi Arabia pondered the notion of spending a spare half-billion dollars. Then last month, on the recommendation of American advisers, he used the money to buy up a sizable piece of America's largest banking company, Citicorp.
The advisers were the Carlyle Group -- not a familiar name on Wall Street, certainly. In fact, its only New York connection is that it takes its name from the city's famed luxury hotel, a favorite of the Carlyle partners. 
 The Carlyle Group, relatively new and based in Washington, is led by people with little experience in the investment business but with strong connections, especially in Washington.
David M. Rubenstein, a founding partner, served as a domestic policy adviser to President Jimmy Carter; Frank C. Carlucci, the vice chairman, was Defense Secretary in the Reagan Administration, and Frederick V. Malek, an adviser, is close to President Bush.
 
Where Connections Led
 The Carlyle Group's connections led to a Washington lawyer, Alphonso Christian. Mr. Christian, of the Washington law firm of Hogan & Hartson, is an old friend of Faissal Fahad al-Talal, who represents the Prince in the United States.
The Prince, who had quietly accumulated a 4.9 percent stake in Citicorp common during the fall, was considering an even bigger investment, $590 million in Citicorp preferred stock, and needed help in making it. To that end, in early January, Mr. Christian arranged for the Prince's representative to meet the Carlyle executives, and Carlyle won the business.
Carlyle's competitors for the Citicorp transaction -- James B. Wolfenson & Company and Eric Gleacher, among them -- dismiss the group's success as a fluke. Carlyle's partners say it was a matter of knowing the right people in the right places.
"If the lawyer had not been recommending us, I don't think we would have been hired," Mr. Rubenstein said.
Connections were not the only factor in the decision. Stephen L. Norris, the Carlyle partner who acted as the point man on the Citicorp transaction, said the Prince's lawyer was concerned about "real or imagined conflicts New York firms might have in dealings with Citicorp, as well as their ability to maintain confidentiality at a time when it was important to do so."
Indeed, Salomon Brothers Inc., which received an unsolicited phone call from the Prince's lawyer about representing the Prince, begged off because of business ties to Citicorp.
Carlyle was also willing to take a pittance of the Prince's money -- $50,000 -- in fees. But ultimately Carlyle earned much more, though Citicorp paid the fee, not the Prince. Neither will disclose the amount.
Prince Waleed is the Carlyle Group's biggest catch by far, but the group is also in the beginning stages of a number of other other sizable undertakings, chiefly in mergers and acquisitions of both foreign and domestic companies.
The firm has come a long way from the mid-1980's, when Edward J. Mathias, a vice president at T. Rowe Price, the Baltimore mutual fund company, spoke many times with Mr. Rubenstein, a neighbor and close friend in suburban Maryland, about starting up a small firm as a relatively inexpensive and safe way to learn the leveraged buyout business.
In late 1986, Mr. Rubenstein gave up his partnership at a Washington law firm and began a six-month hunt for investors interested in putting money into such a firm. Along the way, Mr. Rubenstein persuaded two bright young executives at the Marriott Corporation, Daniel A. D'Aniello and Mr. Norris, to join him. William E. Conway Jr., chief financial officer at the MCI Communications Corporation, joined later. The Carlyle Group now employs 25.
"We thought we could take four smart fellas, set them up in business, and lever them with partners that a major firm might have available," Mr. Mathias said.
 
Impressive Backers
 In addition to T. Rowe Price, the original partners and Mr. Mathias lined up an impressive lot to invest in the fledgling enterprise: Alex. Brown & Sons, First Interstate Bank of Los Angeles and the Richard K. Mellon family trust.
Compared with the money Wall Street was raising for deals at the time, the firm's initial capital base of $5 million was paltry. Nevertheless, just two months after its creation, Carlyle found itself in the midst of a takeover struggle when it began buying stock in Chi-Chi's, a Mexican restaurant chain based in Louisville, Ky.
Carlyle never got the chance to run the chain because in March 1988, Foodmaker Inc. acquired Chi-Chi's for $285 million. But Carlyle's stake in Chi-Chi's generated a $3.5 million profit.
Since then, Carlyle has tended to raise money on a deal-by-deal basis. A wide range of foreign and domestic institutions and individuals, from Banque Paribas of France to the Sumitomo Bank of Japan, have invested in or helped to finance Carlyle deals.
Carlyle transactions have generally involved much more equity than most of the leveraged buyouts of the 80's. And much of that equity is sold to management teams that remain in place. In this way, Carlyle reduces the potential return to its investors but it also lowers its risk if its deals crumble under the weight of debt-service payments.
The investment record of the firm is thus far difficult to judge, since payouts in its leveraged buyout business are generally not expected for five to seven years.
 
High Price for Oakite
 What is clear, however, is that in at least once case it paid an extremely high price for Oakite Products Inc., a manufacturer of industrial and consumer cleaners and lubricants in Berkeley Heights, N.J., investment bankers said. Carlyle acquired it in early 1989 for $90 million, more than 12 times the company's pretax 1988 earnings of roughly $7 million.
"At that time paying as much as eight times earnings would have been a full price," an investment banker familiar with Oakite said. Mr. Rubenstein said Carlyle had recently signed a letter of intent with an unidentified German partner who would inject an unspecified amount of capital into Oakite.
Nor does Carlyle win praise for its $19 million purchase of the Ticketron Sports and Entertainment division in 1989 from the Control Data Corporation. Late last month Carlyle announced the planned sale of Ticketron to the Ticketmaster Corporation, a major competitor, Terms were not disclosed, but analysts familiar with the business said that Ticketron had been losing money for months.
Carlyle has high hopes for other projects. It bought Caterair International, an airline catering service purchased from Marriott in 1989 for $650 million. Caterair had revenues of just over $1 billion and earned pretax profits of $100 million in 1990.
 
Asserts Its Worth
 "Despite the fact that the airline business is in trouble, the company is worth an enormous amount more than what we paid for it," Mr. Rubenstein asserted.
As senior adviser to Carlyle, Mr. Malek, who briefly served as director of the 1988 Republican convention, suggested to Carlyle that the President's eldest son, George W. Bush, would be a positive addition to Caterair's board. Mr. Malek is a Caterair director and also vice chairman of Northwest Airlines, a major Caterair customer.
"I thought George W. Bush could make a contribution to Caterair," Mr. Malek said. "He would be on the board even if his father weren't President. The fact that he is in Dallas is an important consideration, because we do a lot of business in the Southwest."
The President's son, who has interests in the oil business, is also part owner of the Texas Rangers baseball team.
Recession and serious overbuilding have severely damaged the commercial real estate market, but Mr. Rubenstein and his partners contend that the firm's $320 million purchase of the Coldwell Banker Commercial Group from Sears, Roebuck & Company in April 1989 will also turn a profit for them. Carlyle executives say Coldwell Banker is increasing market share in a down market, and has benefited from being less exposed in the Northeast than other real estate companies. Roughly 40 percent of the company's business is in Southern California and the Southwest, areas that thus far have not suffered as severely as other parts of the country.
 
Happy With Citicorp Deal
 Carlyle is delighted with the deal it struck for the Prince with Citicorp for its preferred stock. The Prince got the stock with a $16 conversion price into Citicorp common, and an 11 percent dividend.
By comparison, the three dozen institutional investors who together bought an additional $600 million worth of the preferred earlier this month got a convertible price of $18.25 a share, and a 10 3/4 percent dividend.
Mr. Norris, who managed the deal for Carlyle, said the terms for the Prince were some $85 million better than the one that followed.
Whether the deal with the Saudi Prince will lead to further business for Carlyle remains to be seen. But Carlyle has hopes: "We were mostly interested in developing a relationship with him that might lead to other things in the future," Mr. Rubenstein said.

HEADLINE: Resales Of Homes Jump by 7.9%

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 25

 BODY:
Sales of existing homes shot up 7.9 percent in February, the first increase since November and the biggest in nearly five years, giving private economists hope that a housing rebound may be heralding the end of the recession.
The National Association of Realtors said today that the February rise put sales of existing single-family homes at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.13 million units. 
 The February bounce in home resales, which essentially erased a 7.3 percent plunge in January, was attributed to falling home prices and lower mortgage rates, luring buyers back into the market following the end of the war in the Persian Gulf.
 
Renewal of Strength Seen
 "After months of sputtering, it looks as though many markets across the nation have passed their low point and are regaining strength," said Harley Rouda, president of the realtor group, "People are ready to buy."
The report on existing home sales followed an equally optimistic report last week that construction of new homes and apartments shot up 16.4 percent in February while applications for building permits rose a healthy 8.5 percent, the first rise for permits in eight months.
Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Company, said that the housing sector typically led the country out of a recession. If February does prove to be the turning point for housing, he added, the recession could end between June and October.
 
Biggest Gain Since 1986
 The 7.9 percent February increase in existing home sales was the first since a 2.6 percent rise in November, and it was the biggest monthly gain since a 9.5 percent jump in April 1986.
Analysts noted that home mortgage rates slipped to 9.25 percent in February, their lowest level since early 1987, while home prices continued to decline.
The median price for homes sold in February was $94,800, down eight-tenths of 1 percent from January and three-tenths below a year ago.
 
Huge Increase in West
 Sales were up in every part of the country, led by a huge 20 percent increase in the West, where homes were sold at an annual rate of 540,000 units. When compared with January, sales were up 8.7 percent in the Northeast, to an annual rate of 500,000 units, and up 8.6 percent in the Midwest, where the annual rate was 880,000 units. Homes in the South climbed 3.4 percent, to a rate of 1.22 million units.
John Tuccillo, chief economist of the realtor group, said he was looking for sales of existing homes this year to total 3.19 million units, helped out by further interest rate drops. He added that fixed-rate mortgages should average 9.1 percent for the year.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Strong Rally Pushes Dollar To 9-Month High vs. Mark

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar shot up to nine-month highs yesterday in a powerful rally stoked by political unrest in Germany and optimism about the postwar American economy.
Gold prices were moderately lower. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery slipped $4.10 an ounce, to close at $359. The Republic National Bank quoted a late bid of $357.25, down $5.05 an ounce from late Friday. 
 Currency traders said the apparent absence of any major central bank interventions freed them to respond to contrasting economic moods in the United States and Germany.
The German mark was weakened by protests in the former East Germany involving more than 85,000 demonstrators, many shouting anti-Government slogans. Demonstrators said Chancellor Helmut Kohl had failed to keep election promises to improve living conditions in eastern Germany rapidly.
Dollar buyers were also driven by a growing sense that the United States' spending for the Persian Gulf war will be less than expected, as other Western economies live up to commitments to pay substantial parts of the cost.
By the close of trading, the dollar was roughly 2 pfennigs higher against the German mark, at 1.6865 German marks, up from late Friday's 1.6485. It was the dollar's highest level against the mark since June.
The market's heavy appetite for dollars was expected to continue even if central banks sell dollars in an effort to drive down its value.
Walter Simon, vice president of foreign exchange at Bank Julius Baer & Company, said the biggest test of the rally's durability will come on April 5, when the Government releases its employment figures for March -- the first postwar month.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 137.90 yen, up 0.85 yen from Friday's close. Later, in London, it was quoted at 138.40 yen. In New York, the dollar rose to 139.20 yen, up from late Friday's 137.60.
In London, the British pound fell to $1.7635, from $1.7890 late Friday. Sterling was also lower in New York, fetching $1.7477, compared with late Friday's $1.7860.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late rates Friday, included: 1.4370 Swiss francs, up from 1.4135; 5.7265 French francs, up from 5.6030; 1,253.00 Italian lire, up from 1,225.38, and 1.1618 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1578.
Gold fell in London to a late bid of $359.45 an ounce, down from $362.75 late Friday. In Zurich, the closing bid was $359.45, down from $362.75 late Friday. Gold in Hong Kong dropped 76 cents an ounce to close at $363.19.
Silver prices were also lower. On the Comex in New York, silver for current delivery settled at $3.926 an ounce, down 4 cents from late Friday.

HEADLINE: U.S. Says Import Relief Is Unlikely for Detroit

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 25

 BODY:
White House officials said today that the Administration was unlikely to ask Japan for further restraints on auto exports to the United States to ease the financial plight of domestic auto makers, but that it could offer such assistance as a temporary easing of some regulatory requirements.
The statement was made as the White House confirmed that the heads of General Motors, Ford Motor and Chrysler met President Bush last Wednesday in an unannounced session. The auto executives met with Mr. Bush just a few hours before the President welcomed the Japanese Foreign Minister, Taro Nakayama, and agreed upon April 4 in Los Angeles for the next meeting with Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu. 
 Speaking of the meeting with the auto executives, Marlin Fitzwater, the White House press spokesman, said Mr. Bush listened to their concerns and said he would consider their problems, "but took no position on any of the specific issues."
The President is expected to ask Mr. Kaifu to make faster progress in ending Japanese import barriers, but is unlikely to press the Japanese leader on the auto issue, Administration officials said.
One senior Administration official said he could think of no problem more troublesome than the financial health of the auto makers, but he noted that the industry has had some form of protection for the last 10 years.
Politically the question is troublesome as well; the recession has badly hurt the industry, and Democrats are gearing up a 1992 Congressional and Presidential campaign portraying the Republicans as soft on Japan.
At the White House briefing today, Mr. Fitzwater stressed that while the Administration favored a "free market approach" to trade, it was also "interested in providing a competitive climate for the auto industry."
 
Lower Rates Would Help
 At an earlier meeting with Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady on Feb. 27, the same auto industry leaders -- Robert C. Stempel of the General Motors Corporation, Harold A. Poling of the Ford Motor Company and Lee A. Iacocca of the Chrysler Corporation -- were told the Administration was trying to push interest rates lower, which could help spur sales, Administration officials said.
Because nearly half of the Japanese cars bought in this country are made here, the official said it would require "a gigantic import restraint" to curb competition from Japanese companies.
One of the key factors in any decision to restrain imports, the senior official stressed, is the impact on consumers. He pointed out that when auto curbs were introduced in 1981, the domestic industry raised prices.
That hit consumers, and the industry won only short-term benefits because as domestic prices rose, the Japanese were able to export larger, more expensive cars to compete on a broader scale.
General Motors, Ford and Chrysler collectively lost $2.1 billion in the final quarter of last year, and James W. Bush, editor of Ward's Automotive Reports, an authoritative automotive trade publication in Detroit, predicted that losses for January, February and March would be substantially higher. The companies have laid off some 60,000 workers in the last few months.
Chrysler has been the most active of the three companies on the import issue. Mr. Iacocca sent a letter to the President dated March 6 formally asking that pressure be put on Japan to limit car and truck sales in the United States for the next 12 to 18 months.
The Japanese have a 31 percent share of the market, of which 18 percent represents imports and 13 percent Japanese cars produced here.
Because of surplus Japanese production and large dealer discounts offered by such companies as Honda and Toyota, Mr. Iacocca fears the Japanese share of the market could rise to 40 percent.
Furthermore, in response to requests by the European Community, the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry has asked Japanese auto makers to hold their exports to Europe below 1990 levels, according to a recent article in the Japan Economic Journal. Chrysler fears that the Japanese cars originally headed for Europe will be diverted here.
Chrysler wants the Japanese to cut exports to the United States by 500,000 units this year, which it figures would keep their market penetration level at 31 percent.

HEADLINE: New Orleans Journal;
Is Park Saved by Destroying a Part?

BYLINE: By FRANCES FRANK MARCUS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, March 25

 BODY:
Even in New Orleans, which dotes on ec centricity, the Piazza d'Italia stands out. Completed 13 years ago, the small rundown park is the quirkiest public place in America's quirkiest city.
At first glance the post-modern piazza looks like the staging for a Hollywood extravaganza that has rearranged itself in transit and plopped down to rest beside an office building: about two acres of odd angles, concentric circles and paving stones. The St. Joseph's Fountain in the piazza is a maniacal subtropical Roman Forum, with rusts and yellows drenching the classical architecture and stainless steel capitals atop the columns. Water pours, spritzes and flows in every direction. Neon outlines the arches and columns. 
 "People either love it or they hate it, which I take as a compliment," said Ron Filson, dean of Tulane University's School of Architecture, who worked on the piazza's design and is trying to keep it intact.
The piazza, which borders Poydras Street not far from the Superdome, has caught the eye of architecture lovers around the world. But it has also caught the eye of a developer who wants to make part of it a driveway for a $100 million luxury hotel.
The developer, Joseph C. Canizaro, has clashed with preservationists in the past, but this is his first duel with post-modern preservationists. In response to the city's search for someone to build a hotel on city-owned land beside the Piazza d'Italia, he has proposed building the 405-room hotel, the Ritz-Carlton, around three sides of the park, swallowing a classical temple, a bell tower and an arch to make room for the 200-foot driveway.
The preservationists emphasize that they are not against placing a hotel beside the piazza. "The piazza was designed to be the middle of a development," Mr. Filson said, with shops, restaurants and a hotel around it, a New Orleans replay of a lively piazza in Italy. "But we don't want parts of it destroyed."
William K. Turner, former dean of the Tulane Architecture School, agreed: "It's a public park, and it shouldn't be the motor court for a hotel."
The piazza lost its status as a public park on Thursday, in a vote by the City Council, even though $1.65 million in state and Federal money was spent to create it. What they call the "undedication" of the piazza was necessary, city officials said, because the title was flawed and because developers were reluctant to develop a place that was designated as a public park. The officials said the city would still have control of development plans.
But the preservationists believe that without its public designation the piazza could be carved up by Mr. Canizaro or someone else.
Built as a tribute to this city's large Italian community, the piazza opened in 1978 with fanfare, chianti and hopes that it would help revitalize the city's center. The opening days brought crowds marveling at the architecture, especially St. Joseph's Fountain, with its 80-foot-long map of Italy, cascades representing Italy's major rivers and pools representing the Adriatic and Tyrrhenian Seas.
But the piazza has fallen on hard times, a victim of Louisiana's struggling economy. No investors ever opened the businesses that would enliven the piazza and pay for its upkeep, as the city had intended.
Tourists and scholars still visit, but they rarely linger. At nightfall a few homeless men spread cardboard pallets for sleeping.
St. Joseph's Fountain began losing its luster almost at once. Neon lights went out and water jets clogged. The fountain now runs part time.
Nineteenth-century warehouses intended as part of the piazza's development have burned or collapsed. Some of the space is being used to park cars.
"This is a significant public space with a strategic location," said Wayne Collier, the city's director of economic development, explaining why the city is seeking a project like Mr. Canizaro's hotel to lease the city-owned land. "If the city is going to be a partner in a public-private venture, we have to look high, at excellence."
And Mr. Collier sees nothing wrong with cars in the piazza. "As a matter of fact," he said, "it's very Italian."

HEADLINE: Germany Overtakes U.S. As World's Export Leader

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: GENEVA, March 25

 BODY:
A newly unified Germany overtook the United States as the world's leading exporter in 1990, the world's trading organization said today.
The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade said a 16.5 percent increase in the value of the mark against the dollar helped to raise the value of German merchandise exports to $421 billion, compared with $394 billion for United States exports. 
 Germany was unified on Oct. 3 after 45 years of division. All of the former East Germany's exports were included in the 1990 total, adding $22.5 billion to the German figure.
 
Japan Still in Third Place
 The United States recorded a greater increase in export volume, at 8.5 percent, compared with only 1.5 percent for Germany. Japan remained in third place, with exports rising 4.5 percent, to $286 billion.
The GATT report, from the secretariat of the 101-nation organization, said growth in world trade and output was likely to slow in 1991 for the third straight year. But it said a global recession was unlikely despite uncertainties in the aftermath of the Persian Gulf war.
The preliminary report, compiled from information available by early March, said worldwide merchandise trade volume rose by 5 percent in 1990, compared with 7 percent in 1989 and 8.5 percent in 1988. Trade value rose 13 percent, to a record $3.5 trillion, largely because of the dollar's weakness.
Trade in services grew an estimated 12 percent, to $770 billion, from $690 billion in 1989, it added.
 
Crisis Contributed to Lag
 Economic disruption and uncertainty caused by the gulf crisis contributed to slower economic growth in 1990, the report said, but probably did not play an important role.
Saudi Arabia recorded the biggest jump in export rankings, to 21st place, from 25th, as earnings rose by nearly 40 percent, to $39 billion, because of sharply higher oil exports and prices for crude oil.
Imports of the leading Asian trading nations continued to rise much faster than exports. Japan, for instance, saw imports rise 11.5 percent while exports gained by only 4.5 percent. China's imports fell 8.5 percent in value while exports grew 18 percent.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
U.S. Securities Decline in Price

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities fell and interest rates rose slightly in light trading yesterday, despite a report from auto makers that does little to buttress arguments of a postwar rebound in consumer spending.
Auto sales for the middle 10 days of March totaled over 6 million units at an annual rate, little changed from the first 10 days of the month and the last 10 days of February. The figures were well under the 6.2 million to 6.5 million sales numbers that Wall Street economists had been projecting. 
 Initially, credit market analysts responded positively as the reports trickled in. But selling commenced a bit later on.
The fact the market turned "tells me everybody is day trading," one government bond trader said.
"People are willing to take a pop in the morning, then cover up in the afternoon," the trader said. "I think it will be that way for the rest of the week. Portfolio managers and the Street look like they want to rest on the performance they had for the quarter."
Traders said that at least some of the selling pressure came from foreign central banks. These institutions, which have been sellers of Treasury securities for the last week or so, were liquidating positions in maturities ranging from two years to seven years yesterday, market participants said.
The auto sales figures were released a day before the Conference Board is expected to release its March survey of consumer attitudes.
Preliminary readings from another such survey compiled by the University of Michigan have shown that consumer confidence rebounded sharply after the end of the Persian Gulf war.
Since the end of the war, credit market participants have been fearful that a rebound in confidence could be translated into a surge in consumer spending, a rise that would pull the economy out of recession.
Based on car sales for the first three weeks of March, those worries seem unfounded.
"The numbers call into question what this rebound in consumer confidence really means," said William V. Sullivan, Jr., a senior vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds. "There is no resurgence yet in buying big-ticket items."
There are sound reasons why consumer spending has not picked up, analysts at MMS International, an economic information and service company said.
"The recession has depressed income and employment levels such that any rebound in sentiment will not rebound into an immediate surge in spending," the analysts noted in their daily market commentary.
Based on price movements, that view was not prevalent in the market yesterday.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 7 7/8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered at a price of 95 5/32 late yesterday, down 3/32, to yield 8.31 percent, compared with 8.30 percent late Friday.
Among note issues, the 7 3/4 percent 10-year notes were offered in late trading at 97 1/2, down 1/32, to yield 8.12 percent.
In when-issued trading, the new two-year notes the Treasury is expected to auction today were offered at a price to yield 7.11 percent. And the five-year notes that are scheduled to be sold tomorrow were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 7.81 percent.
At the Treasury's weekly auction of three-month and six-month bills, the three-month securities were sold at an average discount rate of 5.86 percent, up slightly from the 5.83 percent average rate at last week's sale.
Bids on the new six-month bills produced an average discount rate of 5.84 percent, compared with an average rate of 5.82 percent a week ago.
In the tax-exempt municipal bond market, Harris County, Tex., offered $208 million of securities in a negotiated sale through underwriters led by Goldman, Sachs & Company.
The issue consists of serial, term and zero-coupon bonds.
The serial bonds were preliminarily priced to yield 5.85 percent on securities maturing in 1995 to 6.40 percent on securities maturing in 2000.
The largest term bond, which matures in 2014, was offered on a preliminary basis with a 7 percent coupon and was priced to yield 7.15 percent.
The securities are rated AA by Moody's Investors Service and AA-plus by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
Activity in the secondary markets for tax-exempt municipal bonds and investment-grade corporate bonds was very light, market participants said. There was little change in prices in either market, according to the traders.

HEADLINE: Mid-March Vehicle Sales Off 11.1%

BYLINE: By PAUL C. JUDGE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, March 25

 BODY:
Sales of American-made cars and light trucks fell by 11.1 percent in the middle of the month, as demand for new vehicles continued to sputter at recessionary levels.
Surveys show consumer confidence has strengthened since February, and dealers report more visitors to showrooms. But analysts say many people simply cannot afford to buy new cars, because they already have so much debt. 
 "We can pretty much count out any bang in sales from the end of the war," said John V. Kirnan, an automotive analyst with Kidder, Peabody & Company in New York. "People may feel better, but they still need to have the economic wherewithal to buy new vehicles."
 
Down From Weak '89 Level
 The nine domestic manufacturers sold 180,195 cars in mid-March, a decline of 9.7 percent from the fairly weak sales level of a year earlier. Seasonally adjusted, cars sold at an annual rate of six million in the period. Customer demand for new cars has been mired at about the same annual pace of six million cars since January. Last year, cars sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.4 million in mid-March.
Sales of light trucks, which account for nearly a third of all vehicles sold, fell by 13 percent, to 104,513.
Nine selling days were in the period this year, from March 11 to 20, compared with eight in the 1989 period.
Tom Webb, the chief economist of the National Automobile Dealers' Association, an industry group in McLean, Va., said the latest results were "conclusive evidence that declining household income is more important than consumer sentiment in determining the pace of new vehicle sales."
Despite the poor results, many dealers expressed optimism at the start of the spring selling season.
"Deals are being made quicker; folks are not negotiating as hard," said Frank Debartolo, the general manager of Celozzi-Ettelson Chevrolet in Elmhurst Ill. "I take that as a sign that their confidence is coming back."
William Hurwitz, the president of Fox Chevrolet in Baltimore, said, "March is the first time in six months that our sales will equal last year's numbers."
But Mr. Hurwitz said many buyers still found it difficult to obtain new-car loans, echoing a concern raised by other dealers. Mr. Kirnan of Kidder, Peabody said 4 of every 10 applicants for new car loans, a record level, were being rejected by commercial banks, which make about half of all new-vehicle loans.
Fritz Elmendorf, a spokesman for the Consumers Bankers Association, a trade organization based in Arlington, Va., said banks had tightened credit standards because many loan applicants were already burdened with high debt. "We're seeing a lot more marginal customers applying for new-car loans," he said.
Some analysts say auto makers face painful choices about how much to cut from their generally strong second-quarter production schedules.
Coming in the wake of production cuts at several domestic and foreign-owned automobile plants in the first quarter, any significant reduction in output "has much broader implications," Mr. Kirnan said, "because the auto industry would continue to be a drag on the U.S. economy."
The Big Three domestic auto makers posted a 12.5 percent drop in their sales of cars and light trucks in the recent selling period. The Japanese car companies with American plants reported a 1.7 percent increase in sales of American-made vehicles.
 
 2/3.M.'s 10.8% Decline
 The General Motors Corporation sold 85,015 cars made at American plants, a decline of 10.8 percent. G.M.'s light-truck sales fell by 11.6 percent, to 43,870.
The Ford Motor Company sold 49,236 cars, down by 15.5 percent. The company's light-truck sales fell by 21.9 percent, to 33,804.
Ward's Automotive Reports, a trade publication, estimated that the Chrysler Corporation sold 19,500 cars in the period, down by 4.3 percent, and 21,900 light trucks, a drop of 3.6 percent. Chrysler stopped releasing its 10-day sales results in January.
The Honda Motor Company sold 11,205 cars made at its plant in Marysville, Ohio, a gain of 1.5 percent over the period a year ago. After three months of sales declines, Honda in March took the unusual step of reducing by $500 the price dealers must pay the company for new cars.
Honda also stored more than 2,000 unsold Accord models at a former Army depot in Marion, Ohio. A company spokesman said today that the auto maker had reduced the number of cars stored at the depot.
The Toyota Motor Corporation's sales of domestically produced cars fell by 22.2 percent, to 7,510, the largest decline among the Japanese auto makers with American plants.

HEADLINE: Business Nod For Weicker On Tax Plan

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, March 25

 BODY:
Three of Connecticut's largest business lobbying groups said today that they would support Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr.'s plan to impose a state income tax if other taxes paid by business were reduced and legal limits were put on state spending.
Equally important, the groups said they would work against any alternative plan, whether it included an income tax or not, if it did not achieve the same results as Mr. Weicker's, including a "significant reduction" in the state's 8 percent sales tax and cuts in taxes paid on interest, dividends and capital gains. 
 Most of the alternatives to Mr. Weicker's plan that are under discussion have avoided an income tax only by maintaining or increasing those other taxes.
The business endorsement, coming on the eve of a daylong public hearing on the budget to be held at the Capitol on Tuesday, reshaped the debate over Mr. Weicker's plan and disrupted the anti-income-tax alliance that some politicians had expected between business groups and Republicans.
 
Republican Alternative
 The lobbying groups that offered Mr. Weicker their support today, the Connecticut Business and Industry Association, the Insurance Association of Connecticut and the Greater Hartford Chamber of Commerce, represent more than 7,000 companies across the state. They were joined by the Connecticut Public Expenditure Council, a business-supported government research group.
In a separate statement, the Greater New Haven Chamber of Commerce today also offered conditional support for Mr. Weicker's plan.
Republicans, who are a minority in both chambers of the General Assembly, are drafting an alternative budget plan that has no income tax, but their plan will not be finished until next month.
"They're foolish and stupid," said the Republican state party chairman, Richard Foley Jr., referring to the business groups.
Mr. Weicker, a former Republican who was elected governor last year as an independent, thanked the groups for "standing up and being counted."
The organizations said in a statement that their endorsement of an income tax was grudging. But representatives of the groups said at a joint news conference at the Business and Industry Association's headquarters near the Capitol that they felt compelled to speak out because they believed the Weicker plan represented the best opportunity to forge the long-term spending restrictions and tax cuts that businesses have sought for years.
And they said they were afraid that if the business community did not take a strong stance, the General Assembly could become deadlocked, creating an atmosphere of uncertainty that would be the worst business climate of all.
"Chaos would be a worse solution," said Timothy J. Moynihan, president of the Hartford Chamber.
 
Setting Conditions
 The organizations said their support for an income tax had four conditions, three of which are already included in the Weicker plan.
Those conditions are cuts in state spending at least equal to the $1.2 billion proposed by Mr. Weicker; benefit and wage concessions from state employees to "bring them into line with the private sector"; reductions in sales and business taxes and the elimination of the existing tax on interest, dividends and capital gains; and long-term controls on spending, written into law or into the state Constitution.
Mr. Weicker, who took office in January, has said he opposes such formal spending controls, especially in the form of a constitutional amendment, but has indicated that some statutory provision to control spending growth could perhaps be negotiated.
Mr. Weicker last month proposed a complete overhaul of the state's fiscal system to address a projected $1.6 billion budget shortfall for the fiscal year beginning July 1 and to stimulate the economy. From the first, he said his plan was designed around cutting business taxes, a step he said was essential. He has vowed to veto any plan that would fail to reduce those taxes.
The price for those reductions, he said, was steep but unavoidable: a flat 6 percent tax on all income over $25,000 for a family, or $12,500 for an individual. Connecticut is one of only 10 states that has no broad-based tax on income.
The president of the Business and Industry Association, Kenneth O. Decko, said that if any one of his group's conditions were not met, support for Mr. Weicker's plan would instantly dissolve into opposition. But he said that any alternative plans would have to meet the same standard.
 The Democrats, who control both chambers of the General Assembly, have taken no unified position on Mr. Weicker's budget, although the Democrats who head the Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee, have said they support an income tax.

HEADLINE: World's Finances Facing Strains As Troubled Areas Try to Rebuild

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, March 25

 BODY:
The growing appetite for long-term investment funds may make interest rates higher than they might otherwise have been in coming years as countries in the Middle East and Eastern Europe seek huge sums to rebuild their battered economies.
A new study by Morgan Stanley & Company said the total demand for capital by Eastern Europe, Latin America and the Middle East would exceed the Western world's supply by more than $200 billion a year in the next few years. 
 Such a shortage and the resulting rise in interest rates would send ripples throughout the world economy. It would hurt corporate borrowers worldwide and home buyers in Europe and the United States, and make it more difficult for debtor nations in Africa and Latin America to attract development loans -- and repay them. Higher interest rates would also raise the cost of financing Washington's growing debt load.
 
Crucial Role for Germany
 David Hale, the chief economist with Kemper Financial Services in Chicago, said Eastern European developments had already pushed up interest rates. He said Bonn's decision to spend $85.5 billion to revive eastern Germany had caused the German central bank to raise interest rates to keep the economy from overheating. Mr. Hale said the move had pushed up interest rates worldwide by at least 50 basis points, or one-half of a percentage point. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
"If the Soviet flag were still flying over East Berlin," Mr. Hale said, speaking figuratively, "American mortgage rates might be 50 or 75 points less."
Jacob Frenkel, chief economist with the International Monetary Fund, said, "In a fundamental sense, there is a problem of a worldwide capital shortage to satisfy the growing demand and need for capital in various parts of the world."
While higher interest rates would have many negative consequences, an investment boom that pushed up rates would have many benefits: more robust economic growth, gains in productivity leading to a higher standard of living, and a boom for industries that make capital goods like machine tools and computers. In addition, higher interest rates would attract greater savings, which would make more money available for investment.
The full force of this capital shortage is not expected to be felt for several years because the recession in the United States and the economic slowdown in Europe have reduced investment spending and helped push down interest rates. In addition, most Eastern European countries are moving slowly to reform their economies, so they are not yet ready to absorb -- nor are Western investors ready to provide -- large sums of capital.
"Even if we're talking about huge numbers for capital demand, for the time being not much has happened." said Charles Wyplosz, an economics professor at the Insead business school outside Paris. "This is a 10-year story."
In the Middle East, the latest estimate by Kuwaiti officials is that $50 billion will be needed to reconstruct their decimated emirate; some economists estimate that rebuilding war-battered Iraq and Iran will require several hundred billion dollars.
The cost of modernizing eastern Germany, German officials suggest, will be at least $300 billion. As for rebuilding all of Eastern Europe, estimates run as high as $2 trillion, and that is before the Soviet Union's hunger for foreign capital is factored in.
 
2 Big Sources Dwindle
 Heightening the problem is that two countries that had been major sources of international investment are now investing more at home. Germany, which before unification had been a huge exporter of capital to other nations, is now channeling its investment funds into its eastern states. And Japan, the other major capital exporter, is sending less money abroad as its economy slows, it refurbishes its infrastructure and its banks recover from plunging stock and real estate prices.
Still, in the eyes of many economists, there can never, strictly speaking, be a capital shortage: If the demand for capital suddenly exceeded the supply of savings, then interest rates would rise, bringing the demand for capital into equilibrium with the supply of savings.
For example, if economic reforms in Eastern Europe pick up steam and the region proves highly attractive to investment, then it could draw in $100 billion a year in investment, many economists say. This could happen because Western investors might conclude that Eastern Europe is a potential gold mine because of its low labor costs, its skilled work force and its expected fast pace of growth.
Prof. David Begg, an economics professor at the University of London, suggested that if Eastern Europe attracted $100 billion a year in outside capital, this could push up world interest rates by 200 basis points, or 2 percentage points.
According to Morgan Stanley researchers, Eastern Europe's and the Soviet Union's needs for imported capital will quadruple in three years, from $28 billion last year to $115 billion in 1993. Morgan Stanley also sees the Middle East's demand for foreign capital jumping from nothing last year to $80 billion next year, and rising to $100 billion in 1992 and 1993.
An increased demand for capital would make it harder and more costly for many third world nations to attract Western investment, economists said. To be sure, most of these countries are not getting much foreign investment now because Western businesses find them unattractive. But economists worry that developing nations that have made large-scale reforms, like Mexico and Chile, and are ripe for investment might have problems attracting money -- or if they did attract it, they would have to pay premium rates.
According to Jacques Attali, president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the new multilateral bank set up to help Eastern Europe, the region needs $2 trillion to rebuild. A study done for the London-based Center for Economic Policy Research found that the region needed $1.3 trillion in investment during the next decade if its living standards were to climb to levels on the lower end of Western Europe's, that is approaching Spain's.
 
Raising Living Standards
 David Roche, chief international strategist for Morgan Stanley, said eastern Germany was an example of why former Communist countries desperately needed capital. "The east German experiment involves a switch in technology from six handles on each machine to employ six workers, to have one silicon chip that works six machines," he said. "This is a shift from having full employment with low productivity and low living standards to having higher productivity and higher living standards. This process is very capital intensive, and the demand for this capital comes to the West."
The other region suddenly clamoring for capital is the Middle East. Before Iraq invaded Kuwait in August, Kuwait invested more than $5 billion abroad each year, money that helped finance factories in Spain and lending by British banks. Now, Kuwait is expected to borrow $20 billion a year. And Saudi Arabia, another longtime exporter of capital, has borrowed $3.6 billion from abroad to help pay for the gulf war.
 
Repairing the Infrastructure
 The demand for capital will grow for other reasons. Many industrial countries are concluding that after years of neglect, they should spend more on the upkeep of highways, railroads and other infrastructure. Such work in the United States, Europe and Japan would require hundreds of billions of dollars.
The aging of the population in Europe, Japan and the United States is another factor pushing up demand for investment. "We want savings and investment to be very high for the next decade or two to put in place the capital stock that will in future decades produce the higher income we need," said Ralph Bryant, a senior follow at the Brookings Institution. "We ought to raise productivity now so it can be higher in the future when a smaller percentage of the population is working."
Most economists say these trends mean that to finance future investment needs, it is essential to raise the rate of savings, especially in the United States, which has a far lower savings rate than Japan and most European countires.
 
One Senator's Proposal
 "Our savings rate is at a record low," said Senator Lloyd Bentsen, Democrat of Texas and chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. "The average American worker saves 5 cents out of every dollar earned, compared to 16 cents in Japan. Lower savings lead to higher interest rates and trade deficits, as well as lower investment and productivity." Senator Bentsen has proposed new legislation on indivudal retirement accounts aimed at increasing the American savings rate.
Many economists stress the importance of reducing Washington's budget deficit, which would translate into an increase in savings. This would in theory stimulate long-term growth by lowering interest rates and allowing more money to be spent on growth-producing investment, rather than on current consumption.
Officials in developing nations often complain that by borrowing so much from abroad to finance its deficit, Washington is using savings that could -- and they say should -- be used to modernize factories in Poland or explore for oil in Mexico.
"The United States may be a place where people can make good investments, but you wouldn't think that we should use the rest of the world's savings," Mr. Bryant said.

HEADLINE: DEADLY PESTICIDE MAY FACE U.S. BAN

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 25

 BODY:
Scientists at the Environmental Protection Agency have recommended a ban on the sale of one of the most poisonous pesticides used in American agriculture, and the agency said today that it would soon decide whether to ban the compound in the United States.
Since 1966 the pesticide, ethyl parathion (prounounced pair-a-THIGH-on), has poisoned more than 650 field workers in the United States, including at least 100 who died, according to studies by the environmental agency, the California Department of Food and Agriculture and other state agriculture departments. 
 Directors of the California agriculture department said the pesticide was so deadly that the nerve gas suits used by allied troops in the Persian Gulf war were being tested this year in a vegetable field in Ventura County, near Los Angeles, to determine whether they could protect workers. Studies by scientists in California show parathion is as deadly to animals and people in relatively small doses as two basic chemical warfare agents, sarin and tabun. Medical studies show that in an hour 140 milligrams of parathion diluted in four ounces of water can kill a person who absorbs it through the lungs, skin, or stomach.
New studies by scientists at the University of California at Davis show that parathion, which is one of the insecticides most widely used in American agriculture, could be a hazard to people and wildlife away from farms because it drifts in the air and can linger in fog. There is also evidence reported by the environmental agency that residues of parathion, primarily in vegetables, raised the risk that consumers could ingest trace amounts.
 
Costs Could Increase
 A representative of Cheminova A/S, the chemical's Danish manufacturer, said a total ban on parathion could cost the company $10 million a year. Studies by the environmental agency said safer substitutes were available, but they would increase costs for farmers and presumably for consumers. The average cost of using parathion, a distributor in Arizona said, is $9 to $12.50 an acre. The cost of a likely substitute, diazinon, is $16 to $24 an acre, the distributor said.
But scientists at the environmental agency said the economic benefits of continuing to apply parathion to roughly four million acres of fruits, vegetables, nuts, and grains each year in the United States were outweighed by the hazards to wildlife and to people.
"Despite existing efforts to protect agricultural workers, mixer/loaders, applicators, and field workers continued to be systematically poisoned," the scientists said in a memorandum that accompanied their recommendation to ban the insecticide.
Linda J. Fisher, the agency's assistant administrator for pesticides and toxic substances, said in an interview today that she would review the recommendation this week and would make a decision soon. Ms. Fisher could decide to ban all uses of the pesticide, some uses of it or take no action at all. Her decision could be challenged by the manufacturer and distributors.
 
Official Expects Quick Decision
"This is a highly, acutely toxic insecticide which is why we're going to take a real close look at it," said Ms. Fisher. "There is no clock on our decision, but I am going to try and make one quickly."
Ethyl parathion, developed in 1947 by the German chemical company Bayer, is one of a family of insecticides, deadly to man as well as pests, known as organophosphates. It has a less toxic sister compound, methyl parathion, which is not affected by this recommendation, the environmental agency said. Introduced in the United States in 1948, parathion did not become popular until 1972, when DDT was banned.
The manufacturer said four to five million pounds of pure parathion were imported by the United States last year. Four American companies mix pure parathion into liquid and granular formulations used to kill insects on roughly 50 different crops. Among the products that receive heavy applications of parathion each year are almonds, peaches, nectarines, plums, apples, lettuce, broccoli, onions, and wheat, the environmental agency said.
"We need to keep this product in the marketplace because it is cost-effective for the grower and if used properly, is safe," said Richard J. Messinger, director of commercial development for the Gowan Company, a small pesticide company in Yuma, Ariz., that sells parathion.
But for years, medical specialists caring for farm workers, the Federal officials and state health and environmental agencies have been concerned about parathion's hazards.
"A lot of the attention on pesticides has been focused on the risk of exposures to residues on food," said Ralph Lightstone, a lawyer for the California Rural Legal Assistance Foundation, a advocacy group for farm workers in Sacramento. "This stuff is extremely deadly poison, and it's hurting workers who are producing the food. We need to focus more attention on the workers on the front lines who handle deadly poisons."
Statistics on deaths and injuries from pesticide poisoning are incomplete, even in California, which has the nation's best system of reporting. Since 1981, California health officials have reported that roughly 200 workers were poisoned by parathion, and most of them were injured seriously enough to require hospitalization. Federal environmental officials estimated in 1988 that 3.5 deaths are caused by parathion every year.

HEADLINE: Dow Up 6.93, to 2,865.84, as Trading Slows

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
Stock prices ended with a small gain yesterday after being sharply higher earlier in the day. Blue-chip stocks fell back late in the day after the Supreme Court said it would rule on whether health warnings on cigarette packages protected manufacturers from personal injury suits.
Earlier, the Dow Jones industrial average had recovered 25 of the 89 points it lost last week. But by the close, it had given back most of the gain, ending the session at 2,865.84, ahead only 6.93.
 
Volume Drops Off
 I.B.M., which slid 15 last week, recovered 1 7/8, to 113 1/2, accounting for more than half of the Dow's gain, but in the wake of the Supreme Court announcement, Philip Morris slid 2 5/8, to 66 7/8, dragging down the Dow more than 5 points. 
Trading, though, slumped to its lowest level in two months, with volume on the New York Stock Exchange sliding to 153.9 million shares. Birinyi Associates said that even program trading was light.
In spite of the blue-chip selloff, secondary stocks continued to show new gains. The Nasdaq composite index, representing many of the smaller stocks, climbed the equivalent of 27 Dow points.
Figures supplied by Indata of Stamford, Conn., showed that 54 mutual funds it surveys weekly pumped nearly $75 million into stock in the week ended March 22. Cash now totals 9.9 percent of investments, it said.
Moreover, with the Dow blue chips down sharply during the period, the cash appeared to have gone into smaller stocks.
"What you're seeing," said Kenneth M. Spence, director of technical analysis for Salomon Brothers, "is one of the most significant changes in the market place -- secondary stocks are entering a long-term uptrend very similar to 1977 through 1980, when secondary stocks strongly outperformed the blue chips."
Jack Solomon, market technician for Bear, Stearns, attributed the Dow pullback to "vulnerability" in Philip Morris after Fitch Investors Service, the rating agency, put the credit ratings of cigarette producers under review pending the outcome of the Supreme Court case.
He noted that Philip Morris, a big part of the Dow industrials, had climbed $30 since August, when the Kuwaiti crisis began, and more than $20 since mid-January, but that "once its vulnerability was shown, profit taking in Philip Morris spread to other stocks."
Moreover, Mr. Solomon said, RJR Nabisco, which has been a volume leader almost daily, "started to succumb." After reaching a new high yesterday of 13, it fell to 11 3/4, down 1/4, with 12.1 million shares changing hands.
American Brands, another tobacco company, fell 1 7/8, to 44 1/8. Other tobacco producers changed very little.
"Last week," Mr. Solomon said, "the defensive issues, like tobacco and food, were leaders. This week, with the recovery of I.B.M., high-tech stocks are the leaders."
This, he said, "shows the market's stabilizing and the downtrend appears to be broken."
Comforted by the rise in I.B.M., traders began loading up on other technology stocks. Apple Computer, which fell 3 last week, rose 1 1/4, to 64 1/2. Microsoft, which lost 2 7/8 last week, jumped 4 1/2, to 98 1/4. Compaq Computer, which dropped 4 1/2 last week, tacked on 2 1/4, to 61 7/8.
The Pacific Stock Exchange high-tech index jumped 1.2 percent, or 35 Dow points.
 
NCR Talks With A.T.&T.
 NCR rose 1 3/8, to 99 5/8, after its directors agreed to meet with A.T.& T. about the phone company's $100-a-share hostile takeover bid. The chairmen of both companies met for several hours yesterday but no agreement was announced.
Square D, which has rebuffed a $78-a-share takeover bid from Schneider of France, fell 5/8, to 78 7/8, even though Rockwell International said it could neither confirm nor deny its interest in Square D.
Walt Disney slid 3 1/2, to 115 1/2, after Mark Manson of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette cut his earnings estimates because of the impact of the weak economy on its theme parks.

Tokyo Stocks Decline
 TOKYO, Tuesday, March 26 (Reuters) -- Stock prices closed lower in light trading today, with the Nikkei index of 225 issues down 306.41 points, or 1.15 percent, at 26,339.38.

HEADLINE: Vallone Has Alternative For Budget

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
The New York City Council, in its most ambitious challenge yet to Mayor David N. Dinkins, yesterday laid out its own blueprint for solving the city's worsening financial problems, cutting $400 million from proposed tax increases and slashing 30,000 jobs over the next four years.
The Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, said the new approach was needed because Mayor Dinkins's plan to close the $3 billion gap in the fiscal year that begins on July 1 could permanently damage the city's economy, driving businesses and the middle class from the city. 
 The Council plan calls for the same level of spending cuts -- about $1.8 billion -- proposed by Mayor Dinkins. But some services, like schools, libraries and parks, would be spared some of the reductions proposed by the Mayor. The difference would be made up by consolidating city agencies and making deeper cuts in areas like social services, housing and mental health.
Much of the lost tax revenue would be made up by $350 million from a bond refinancing and the sale of land under New York's airports, the sort of one-shot revenues frowned on by the city's fiscal watchdogs and bond-rating agencies. To make this more palatable, the Council proposed using some of the money to set up a reserve fund of up to $1 billion at the end of four years to deal with future fiscal emergencies.
 
Flexing Its New Muscles
 In a measured response to the proposal, Mayor Dinkins withheld comment, saying the administration received its first copy of the plan only shortly before Mr. Vallone convened a news conference to discuss it.
The plan is almost certain to become a subject of a debate over spending priorities between the Mayor and the Council, which has to approve the budget.
Under the new City Charter, the Council gained the budget powers of the Board of Estimate, which was abolished. The Council was required to comment by yesterday on the preliminary budget presented by the Mayor in January, but was not required to submit its own financial plan. Mr. Vallone apparently used the occasion take some initiative away from the Mayor.
Administration officials said they had already been considering some of the Council's proposals, like productivity savings, service cuts and consolidations. But they questioned using one-time revenues to solve even part of the city's budget problems.
"We do not believe this city can survive simply by cutting services and raising taxes," Mr. Vallone said. "We have to come up with some new ideas."
By presenting its own multiyear budget-cutting plan, the Council is seeking to improve its public standing and put itself in position to battle the Mayor, if necessary, over the city's future direction.
Mayor Dinkins said that he "would be delighted" if he found that the Council had proposed a way of reducing the need for tax increases, but that so far he was not convinced. "We don't have the luxury of just proposing something." he said. "We have to look at its total ramification."
Last week, after months of being criticized as lacking leadership, Mr. Dinkins acknowledged that next year's budget gap had grown to $3 billion, and laid out a strategy for permanently reducing the cost and size of city government, including asking workers to give back health and welfare benefits.
Under the Council plan, 15,000 jobs would be cut next year, 3,500 through early retirement, 5,900 through productivity improvements and 6,400 through service cuts, of which 2,000 would come through layoffs. Attrition and productivity increases would trim another 15,000 jobs over the next few years. There are 225,000 municipal jobs now financed by the city, excluding Transit Authority and Housing Authority jobs.
While the Council proposed slashing nearly two thirds of the $755 million in property-tax increases in the Mayor's budget, it would impose a new tax of 25 cents a ride on cab fares and replace the state's 5-cent-a-bottle deposit with a 5-cent-a-bottle tax to pay for recycling and debt service on sanitation projects. Repealing the bottle deposit law would require action by the State Legislature.
The Council plan won praise from the city's fiscal monitors, who were skeptical of the one-time revenues but impressed by the Council's initiative. Allen J. Proctor, executive director of the State Financial Control Board, said the plan presented a "strategic view" of the city's problems that deserved to be taken seriously.
The plan appeared to benefit both the real-estate industry, which has complained bitterly about property-tax increases, and middle-class taxpayers.
 But environmental groups opposed the proposed repeal of the bottle deposit law, and the taxi industry denounced its proposed tax as "an outrage." The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said that it was willing to discuss the purchase of airport land, but that the $1.2 billion price sought by the Council appeared excessive.

HEADLINE: Amazon Forest Loss Is Sharply Cut in Brazil

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO

 BODY:
FOREST rangers were murdered, and sugar was poured in the fuel tanks of patrol helicopters during the Amazon's fractious "burning season," but the deforestation rate dropped sharply last year, according to new figures gathered by satellites.
Sparing an expanse of rain forest the size of Delaware, Brazilian farmers and ranchers burned 27 percent less forest in 1990 than in 1989, according to a study by the National Space Research Institute. 
 By comparing Landsat satellite images, researchers found that the annual rate of forest clearing dropped to 5,334 square miles in 1990 from 7,273 square miles in 1989.
"The drop is very clear and very real," said Luiz Gylvan Meira, director of land observation for the Brazilian institute.
 
Global Effects of Losses
 With world concern high over potential global warming from deforestation, the Brazilian figures are eagerly anticipated by scientists and environmentalists every year. After several years of controversy, a consensus has emerged among scientists that figures by the Space Research Institute are the most accurate yardstick for measuring the loss of the Amazon's forest cover.
The institute's data analysis techniques are highly accurate, said Compton J. Tucker, an American biologist who has been using satellites to study Brazil's deforestation for the last decade, most recently for NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland.
Next month in Puerto Rico, the Brazilians plan to train teams from six other Amazon Basin nations in the skills of tracking rain forest deforestation. For the project, the Pan Amazon Deforestation Study, NASA has purchased regional satellite data from the Space Research Institute in Sao Jose dos Campos.
While photographs from space show a slowing of deforestation, people on the ground disagree on the causes.
"I attribute the drop to rain and to the economic recession -- not to the Government of Brazil," said Fabio Feldmann, an opposition legislator who was recently elected chairman of the environment committee of Brazil's Chamber of Deputies. Other critics say that Operation Amazonia, the Government's campaign against deforestation, was begun in late August, well after the annual six-month burning season had started.
Raimundo Deusdarah, who saw several of his forest rangers and helicopters shot at last year, believes otherwise. Mr. Deusdarah, director of fire control operations for Brazil's state environmental agency, recently listed the successes of last year's campaign: agents seized 20,000 illegally cut logs and issued $9 million in fines to 3,500 violators of burning and cutting regulations.
One measure of the program's impact was the violent response by landowners: 4 of the agency's 324 agents were shot to death and 2 of its 6 helicopters were struck by gunfire.
Next month, the authorities plan to begin a more intensive "Operation Amazonia," with a $4 million budget, four times last year's budget.
It is to start with public information campaigns targeted at rural unions, schools and landowners in Para, Mato Grosso and Rondonia, states that accounted for three-quarters of last year's Amazon deforestation. About 12 percent of the original 1.35-million-square-mile forest has been lost, up from 4.4 percent in 1978.
This year, Operation Amazonia plans to enlist the services of military and civil aviation pilots who frequently crisscross remote areas of the forest. Brazil's army has trained 18 environmental agents to plot fire coordinates radioed from aircraft.
Under an agreement reached last September, the Space Institute will transmit by computer modem daily reports on fire sightings read from photographs taken by satellites of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which pass over Brazil four times a day.
But in a country where the economy last year suffered its sharpest contraction in 40 years, environmental officials say they do not know whether budget officials will actually release the $4 million needed for the Amazon preservation campaign.
With saving the rain forest a popular cause in Europe and the United States, Brazil has been showered recently with low-interest loans and outright gifts. But virtually all the money is designated for Amazon research or park preservation projects.
"There is a lot of talk about preserving the Amazon, but very few resources actually arrive for the control side," said Mr. Deusdarah. "We need to buy helicopters, boats, jeeps. Any foreign aid is welcome."

HEADLINE: A Scientific Watergate?

 BODY:
Five years after disturbing questions were raised about a research paper written in part by the Nobel laureate David Baltimore, the celebrated case is finally moving toward a verdict. Federal investigators have concluded, in a draft report, that the paper contained fraudulent data and did not accurately reflect the laboratory experiments on which it was supposedly based. Worse yet, data subsequently published by the Baltimore group to amend and justify its original paper were almost certainly fabricated.
The verdict may well destroy the career of the scientist accused of the misrepresentations and fabrications, Dr. Thereza Imanishi-Kari. But the most damning indictment should be lodged against the scientific community's weak-kneed mechanisms for investigating fraud. Faced with stonewalling by Dr. Baltimore, one of the nation's most prominent scientists, several investigative panels seemed more intent on smothering bad publicity than digging out the truth. 
 In this respect, the Baltimore case is reminiscent of the Watergate scandal. Just as Watergate started with a "third-rate burglary" and ended in a huge cover-up, so the Baltimore case started with apparent fraud by a single scientist and soon led to a widespread denial of wrongdoing by almost everyone in a position to right the wrong.
 The tale starts with a scientific paper published in 1986 that appeared to announce a revolutionary finding with important implications for the immune system. It was written by a team of six scientists, headed by Dr. Baltimore, who was then at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and is now the president of Rockefeller University.
The experiments purported to show that when one strain of mice was injected with genes from another strain, their native genes were forced to produce antibodies very like those produced by the injected genes. That kind of influence by one type of gene on another had never before been seen. And now, it appears, it was probably not seen by Dr. Baltimore's team either.
The first hint that something was amiss came from a junior scientist, Dr. Margot O'Toole, who accidentally discovered that the results published in the paper did not jibe with 17 pages of Dr. Imanishi-Kari's laboratory notes that had fallen into her hands. A graduate student independently became suspicious. But neither got satisfaction when they tried to get corrective action from academic and scientific leaders.
Had the case not been dragged into public view by a fraud-hunting gadfly at the National Institutes of Health, Walter Stewart, and a Congressional committee headed by Representative John Dingell, the truth might never have emerged.
The initial investigations of Dr. O'Toole's complaints smacked of an old-boy network drawing up the wagons to protect scientific reputations. Investigations at Tufts University and M.I.T. found no fraud or even major error. The National Institutes of Health appointed an investigating panel with close ties to Dr. Baltimore. Even after the panel was reconstituted to mollify critics, it produced a pussyfooting report, finding no evidence of misconduct despite the fact that an experiment had been reported that was never actually performed.
Only after Congress became involved did the N.I.H. begin to display some backbone. Its new Office of Scientific Investigations produced the gritty and damning report that finally calls a fabrication a fabrication.
Dr. Baltimore has, from the start, seemed more intent on squelching inquiry that getting to the bottom of the charges. Although he has not himself been accused of fraud, he signed two documents -- the original paper and a follow-up correction -- containing data now deemed to have been fabricated by Dr. Imanishi-Kari.
Dr. Baltimore also belittled Dr. O'Toole as a "discontented" postdoctoral fellow, making her virtually unemployable for several years. And he orchestrated a chorus of support from sympathetic colleagues by sending a letter to 400 scientists warning that Congressional intervention could "cripple American science."
Dr. Baltimore has made enormous contributions to American science; he won a Nobel Prize in 1975, built up a major biology institute at M.I.T. and contributed to the development of national policy on AIDS. But his decision to tough out the allegations of wrongdoing instead of meeting them openly has ultimately harmed the reputation of the profession he so brilliantly represents.

HEADLINE: Time to Reclaim the Javits Center

 BODY:
Pilferage, featherbedding and unreasonable charges for routine services now jeopardize the success of New York City's Jacob K. Javits Convention Center.
A much-heralded labor agreement struck just before the vast crystalline exhibition hall opened in 1986 was supposed to prevent the extortionate conditions that had repelled customers from the New York Coliseum. But five years later, dismal practices still endure. 
 The pact's no-strike provision has avoided damaging work stoppages. But the state authority that runs the center has been unaggressive in pursuing sensible work rules that keep down costs and corruption. "Even if it takes two seconds to get something done, you have to pay for a minimum of one hour and might have to use three people," the manager of a dental trade show recently complained. To plug in a lamp, exhibitors must use an electrician, incurring a charge of $80.
The problems can no longer be ignored. The sagging economy has intensified competition from convention halls in other big cities, where labor costs may be 50 percent lower. Robert Morgenthau, the Manhattan District Attorney, is investigating allegations of extortion and other crimes by the center's employees. And a civil racketeering suit filed by Federal prosecutors last September alleges that Mafia control of the carpenters' union has turned the center into a hiring hall for mobsters and former convicts.
"Convention Center jobs," says one Government affidavit, provide "easy work at overtime rates, together with the opportunity to make even more money by shaking down exhibitors, thefts and other rackets."
Finally facing up to the mess, Gov. Mario Cuomo has named a close adviser, Fabian Palomino, as the center's new president. Mr. Palomino vows an assault on uncompetitive practices, and his early record is encouraging. Security is being beefed up to deter thefts of supplies and equipment, and a new inspector general plans to make extensive use of undercover agents. He has also warned employees against rude and uncooperative behavior toward customers.
But tough issues loom ahead. Most urgently, Mr. Palomino needs to seek new contract arrangements that firmly address concerns about costs and corruption.

HEADLINE: ON MY MIND;
Talk in Jerusalem

BYLINE: By A. M. Rosenthal

 BODY:
Inside Israel's Cabinet, some of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's most important ministers are talking to him about trying a kind of do-it-yourself distancing plan for Israelis and Palestinian Arabs.
They suggest that what the Israelis could do themselves is to pull out their troops from several key towns in the West Bank to the outskirts -- perhaps Nablus, Hebron and Jericho. It would not be a withdrawal or surrender of territory. 
 But it would be a step toward ending killings of Arabs and Jews by putting room between the Israeli Army and the Palestinians, giving both more breathing space.
And these Cabinet members are proposing that the Palestinians then be permitted to take over most of the functions of administering civil life on the West Bank, under an agreed Palestinian board.
Of course, this would not satisfy passions for an independent Palestinian state. That is, a second Palestinian state in addition to the one that Britain sliced off from the Palestine mandate in 1920 and now goes under the alias of Jordan.
 Unfortunately the second state Palestinians have in mind would require Israel to go drown in the sea. It is as much a fantasy as Saddam Hussein's dream of ruling the Middle East, and based on the same fatal self-delusion.
But if the talking becomes reality, Palestinians would have a chance to show if they can run most of their affairs without making every day a carnival of anti-Israel hate and stabbing.
Mr. Shamir also will not be easy to convince. He is a subtle and sophisticated man, which his friends know and his enemies still are learning. But he does not believe in gambling on Israeli security. Suppose Israel pulls back some troops and the Palestinians take flexibility for weakness and bring out more knives?
Who will the world blame for the blood that will flow in putting them down -- who but Yitzhak Shamir and the Israeli Government? He can imagine the U.S. television specials.
The talk in the Cabinet is a variation on a unilateral theme that has popped up over the years. But Mr. Shamir hears his colleagues out. Some of the interested Likudniks are among the most important in the party, among them Defense Minister Moshe Arens, Health Minister Ehud Olmert, Foreign Minister David Levy and Dan Meridor, the Justice Minister. All of them are considered potential successors to Mr. Shamir. They are not acting as a cabal but they do have influence, no question of that.
 They have an audience in mind that goes beyond the Palestinians, and its name is George Bush.
They are totally aware that President Bush is eager for movement in the Israeli-Palestinian situation. They are weary of Israel constantly being the sole target of American pressure.
Secretary of State James Baker goes to a meeting of Arab coalition partners. They refuse to end the Arab state of war against Israel, now almost a half-century steeped in blood and bitterness.
But in Jerusalem, his next stop, Mr. Baker talks about the interesting new ideas he is hearing from the Arabs. That plunks the ball in Israel's political court. But what ideas? He doesn't say and the Israelis insist they still do not know.
The Likud unilateralists hope that if Israel takes the initiative the President will then press the Arabs for a demonstration of the will for peace -- deeds, not words, as American Presidents like to say.
Such as: the end of the state of belligerency and of the boycott of Israel and companies doing business with Israel. The boycott has been more of an economic problem than Israel has liked to admit.
Just a few days ago, Kuwaiti representatives in Argentina officially informed a local company that "Jewish firms" would not be eligible for reconstruction contracts -- raising the nastiness level. Let's see how that sits with the 90 senators who earlier asked the Emir to end the boycott.
So it can be expected that before he agrees to any unilateral move, Mr. Shamir would want some clear word from Washington that the U.S. will indeed drop the Israeli arm and start twisting the Arab, and how hard.
The chances are against any unilateral move but it has become thinkable.
And the chances of the Palestinians getting a better offer if they again show their talent for picking wrong? Why, none.
As for a Palestinian state, it exists already, just across the narrow River Jordan, and one day will be known by its real name.

HEADLINE: No More Uncle Sucker

BYLINE: By Ernest F. Hollings; Ernest F. Hollings, Democrat of South Carolina, is chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The Bush Administration is waging a desperate campaign to allow fast track consideration of the "free trade" agreement with Mexico and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. It would forbid amendments by Congress and require an up-or-down vote within 30 days. What is it in these agreements that the Administration fears will not withstand scrutiny?
Bear in mind, there was no fast track for critical arms treaties with the Soviets; these treaties were exhaustively vetted by Congress and stood on their own merits. SALT II ran into a sticky wicket, but the Soviets came right back to the table to hammer out the treaty on intermediate-range nuclear forces. If old-school Communists can respect America's constitutional processes, surely our democratic allies can, too. 
 So why is the White House so hot to hogtie debate and effectively nullify Congress's duty under the Constitution "to regulate commerce with foreign nations"? The answer is obvious: the emerging GATT deal and Mexican free trade agreement are so damaging to key sectors of our economy and workforce that they simply will not stand up under unfettered Congressional debate.
These treaties promise more of the same "free trade" magic that has created $100 billion-plus trade deficits for the last decade while gutting America's manufacturing base. Congress is fed up with playing Uncle Sucker. Japan and Europe, after reaping the benefits of one-sided, give-away trade agreements with the U.S. for decades, are at long last about to meet the America that can say no.
Let's be clear exactly where America stands, four and a half decades after World War II. As a victor in that war, we used the Marshall Plan in Germany and the MacArthur plan in Japan to rebuild those countries into democratic, capitalist powerhouses. We provided an abundance of credits, aid and expertise, and we opened our market wide to imports.
Forty-six years later, it's time for the U.S. to take away the punch bowl. We are naive to expect the Europeans and Japanese to be grateful to us and open up their markets to America as we did ours to them. We tried to set an example of high-minded "free trade" openness, and we were mugged. We tried jawboning, and were ignored. Common sense says that our rivals will deal fairly only when we make it their raw economic interest to do so.
As Henry Clay said some 125 years ago: "The call for free trade is as unavailing as the cry of a spoiled child in its nurse's arms for the moon or the stars or the glitter in the firmament of heaven. It never has existed. And never will." The fact is that selective trade protection is as American as the Firecracker 500.
It's also as American as Hamilton and Madison, who teamed up to pass the first bill through Congress on July 4, 1789, erecting a palisade of tariffs as high as 50 percent on some 30 articles, beginning with iron. Our Founders reckoned that their hard-won independence would soon be snatched away if it were not matched by economic independence. They were right.
Today, while Administration officials prattle like schoolchildren about "free trade," our rivals flex their governmental muscles in order to obtain economic growth and commercial advantage. They develop and protect domestic industries, channel subsidies and investment, and orchestrate export-oriented trade strategies to seize market share.
Rather than mobilize for this new challenge of government-orchestrated capitalism, recent American administrations have opted for the commercial equivalent of unilateral disarmament. They have rejected the Federal Government's traditional role as defender of U.S. economic security, instead embracing a style of promiscuous "free trade" that would have made Adam Smith blush.
Last year, we won the cold war. This year, we won the gulf war. Now it is time to win the war that really matters for America's future: the trade war -- the no-holds-barred struggle among nations for market share and standard of living in a largely zero-sum world marketplace.
Let us fire the first U.S. volley in this war by shooting down fast track, kid-glove consideration of GATT and the Mexican free trade agreement. Congress must insist on the full, deliberate consideration intended by Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution.

HEADLINE: Deduct Local Taxes From Federal Income Tax;
Rewards for Risks

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The main problem with President Bush's new proposal to reduce the tax on capital gains is that it would continue to tax gains from the sale of new and old securities at the same (albeit lower) rate. As a consequence, it would do little or nothing to stimulate economic growth. 
 The tax should be lowered, but only on investments in new issues, the fuel of economic growth. Our problem is not the level of the capital gains tax, but that gains from new and old securities are taxed at the same rate. Unless you give investors in high-risk, new issues a tax break, 99 percent of stock market action will continue to be in old stocks, which are perceived as safer.
These transactions do little or nothing to stimulate real economic growth, for none of the money changing hands goes to companies that issue securities for use in expanding output, modernizing equipment, adding new products or research. Joe Doaks sells to Tom Smith and uses the proceeds to buy yet another old stock from Frank Jones.
With security transaction volume at record levels, there is hardly a pressing need to try and get more money flowing into the stock market by lowering the capital gains tax across the board. What we need is to get more money going into new businesses. The way to bring this about is to give investors in new isssues a tax break.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS PEOPLE;
Equitable Life Names An Investment Head

BYLINE: By Anthony Ramirez

 BODY:
When Brian F. Wruble takes over as chief investment officer for the nation's third-largest life insurance company on April 1, he will help to invest assets that are roughly equal in value to the economy of the former East Germany.
At the Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States, Mr. Wruble will be the chief strategist for more than $60 billion in assets. A former securities analyst who started out specializing in oceanographic stocks, Mr. Wruble was named yesterday to replace Richard H. Jenrette, who continues as Equitable's chairman and chief executive. 
 Like much of the United States insurance business that has invested heavily in commercial real estate, now in a deep recession, Equitable has had problems.
Last year, Equitable announced a net decrease in surplus, or a loss, of $203.5 million, compared with a net increase in surplus, or a profit, of $14.9 million a year earlier. Last December, Equitable also announced plans to raise capital by switching to public ownership from ownership by its policyholders.
When he takes over his new job, Mr. Wruble will have had plenty of practice in directing big investments. As chairman and chief executive officer of Equitable's second-largest subsidiary, the Equitable Capital Management Corporation, he helped direct about $33.2 billion in assets.
The $60 billion in assets Mr. Wruble will now direct is about two-thirds bonds and a few cash equivalents like Treasury bills. The rest is real estate mortgages, like those for shopping centers and office buildings, as well as equity stakes in commercial real estate.
By contrast, Mr. Wruble's experience at Equitable Capital has been in stocks and bonds, mainly private-placement issues. "I expect to spend a period of time studying real estate," he said.
Mr. Wruble was the founding chief executive in 1985 of Equitable Capital and will retain that position, as well as his title as executive vice president of Equitable Life Assurance.
Having helped Mr. Jenrette throughout his tenure as chief investment officer, Mr. Wruble does not expect significant changes in the parent company's investment strategy. "At the margin," he said, "we will take somewhat less risk going forward, mainly scaling back our exposure in riskier bonds and riskier real estate ventueres."
A native of Kalamazoo, Mich., Mr. Wruble is a 12-year veteran of Equitable, having started out as the head of the portfolio management department. Before joining Equitable, he had been a securities analyst for Smith Barney, where he covered consumer durable goods, like refrigerators, automobiles and television sets.
An electrical engineer with bachelor's and master's degrees from Cornell University, Mr. Wruble had worked for a time on navigation for experimental nuclear submarines. "I had the most fun of my life at the bottom of the ocean," he said. He was hired as a securities analyst in the early 1970's when oceanography was in vogue as an investment area.
He and his wife, Kathleen Wilson Bratton, have three children aged 20, 17 and 2 years.

HEADLINE: Honeymoon for Mayor Continues in the Capital

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 25

 BODY:
When Mayor Sharon Pratt Dixon took the oath of office at noon on Jan. 2, she faced two daunting problems -- red ink and red faces.
The city's budget shortfall was pushing past $300 million, with no letup in sight in the demand for more governmental services. 
 At least as serious, the city's once-shiny civic reputation had been tarnished by Ms. Dixon's predecessor, Marion S. Barry Jr., whose personal and political transgressions had resulted in a drug conviction and rejection by the voters.
Less than three months after her inauguration, at which she declared that "nothing is beyond our reach," Ms. Dixon appears to have made significant progress toward solving both her major problems: persuading Congress to help the city balance its budget and persuading many of the city's dispirited citizens that a new political age has, indeed, arrived.
 
Many Barriers to Clear
 But there is still much to do, many more municipal obstacles and much more municipal ennui to surmount. The next week or so, when many new appointments will be made and a new budget will be hammered out with the independent-minded City Council, could be the most crucial time of Mayor Dixon's tenure.
Mixing symbolism and substance, still enjoying the political honeymoon accorded the newly inaugurated, the 46-year-old Mayor has already managed major cuts in the deficit, though the demand for social services and the lagging local economy threaten to keep the red ink flowing. She has persuaded a once-skeptical Congress to give the city an extra $100 million to help it pay its debts, promising in return to slash bloated city personnel rolls and wasteful city programs. She has personally implored so many senators and House members to come to the city's aid that her office staff presented her with a set of kneepads "to make the begging easier."
At the same time, she has suffused the city with a real, if tenuous, "can do" spirit, something long absent. Show her a podium or a clutch of people and instantly she becomes a civic cheerleader, imploring her audience to get involved in city affairs, to believe that the city can polish away the tarnish and solve its deep problems of poverty, crime, housing, health, schooling and racial prejudice.
"Yes, we can!" she fairly shouts at the end of each little spiel, hammering the air with a clenched fist.
 
From Limo to Sedan
 She has dropped in unannounced on numerous city offices, including the notoriously poky motor vehicle agency, serving notice that efficiency will be rewarded but slackers and shirkers will face the ax. She has traded in the imperiously long mayoral limousine for a standard-issue city sedan. She has even mugged it up on television with local sports broadcasters in a campaign to bring big-league baseball back to the city, matching the broadcasters quip for quip, telegenic smile for telegenic smile and arguing earnestly that the return of the sport would be good not only for the city's sports fans and its economy but also, equally important, for its spirit and sense of identity.
"Things are going well, very well," she said the other day as she hurried through City Hall toward yet another meeting and another round of debate about how to raise more money, cut more programs and get more work out of a smaller bureaucracy.
There are critics.
 
Too Much the Candidate?
 Some say the Mayor is too aloof, too inclined to ignore traditional power brokers, too dependent on aides short on political savvy. Worst of all, the critics contend, she has no governing plan or vision other than cuts and reductions of top-heavy programs and agencies inherited from the Barry administration.
They argue that Ms. Dixon still sounds like a candidate instead of a Mayor and has yet to demonstrate that she can master the fractious City Council or the huge municipal bureaucracy. They say she is confrontational and needlessly becomes involved in fights.
"She has worked impressively with Congress, and she has set a good tone of governing," said Joslyn N. Williams, the head of the Democratic Party in the District of Columbia and a local labor leader. "But she's being too much of a loner, and she's trying to balance the budget on the backs of city workers and the poor. The honeymoon she's enjoying is likely to end in the next week or so as she and the City Council finish thrashing out next year's budget."
There are signs that the honeymoon is already ending.
In apparent response to complaints that she did not have enough hard-nosed political insiders in her advisory circle, she recently replaced her chief of staff, Joseph R. Caldwell, a lawyer, with Patricia M. Worthy, the chairman of the city's Public Service Commission. But that move failed to quiet the critics, who contended that Ms. Worthy was also inexperienced politically, a contention that drew a sharp counterattack from Ms. Dixon.
"We are doing things differently from the way some of the power brokers are accustomed to things being done," the Mayor said, picking up some of the language she had used in her campaign. "If it means it doesn't translate in terms of their support at the end of four years, so be it. It will be clear at the end of the four years that we were here, we made a difference."
Another sign that the honeymoon is ending comes from the new chairman of the City Council, John Wilson.
"We've got to come up with a new budget in the next couple of weeks," he said. "The Mayor is talking cuts but no more taxes. I'm not sure you can do it that way. People are going to have to put it on the political line before this is over."
 
Something Good to Say
 But for the moment, the Mayor's critics are in the minority, overshadowed by her successes and a seeming willingness by others who may harbor doubts to let the honeymoon run a bit longer. In fact, some of the city's toughest critics -- members of Congress, which oversees all city business -- say Ms. Dixon's progress has been nothing less than remarkable.
In appproving the $100 million gift and agreeing to consider further grants in coming years, numerous members of the House and Senate, Democrats and Republicans, lavishly praised Ms. Dixon, a Democrat, for setting a new tone in governing the District of Columbia and for re-establishing a strong link between City Hall and Capitol Hill. It was as though the legislators, after a long drought, had found an opportunity to say something good about the Mayor and management of the capital.
"Mayor Dixon is a breath of fresh air," said Senator Brock Adams, the Washington State Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on D. C. Appropriations. "People want her to succeed. The $100 million is directly attributable to her willingess to reach out and meet with scores of legislators and her willingness to cut and trim and remake. All that was absent in the last city administration."
Representative Thomas J. Bliley Jr., a Virginian and the ranking Republican on the House District Committee, said Ms. Dixon's hard lobbying on Capitol Hill had put a stop to "District bashing" by legislators. The new Mayor, he added, had paid him more visits in her first two months than had her predecessor, Mr. Barry, in the better part of 10 years.
President Bush, whose Administration sharply criticized the Barry administration, has indicated that he will go along with the Congressional gift to the Dixon administration, providing that other sections of the bill unrelated to the District are acceptable. In fact, the President struck up a working relationship with Mayor Dixon well before the Congress did. He invited her to breakfast two days after her inauguration.
"She's off to a good start," said Mark Plotkin, who was active in Democratic Party affairs and now does political commentary for a local public radio station. "She's shown herself to be a great Capitol Hill lobbyist for the city and a great cheerleader. But from here on out, she's also going to have to show that she can be Mayor, too."

HEADLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre, 85, Dies; Traditionalist Defied the Vatican

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, March 25

 BODY:
Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre, the traditionalist prelate whose defiance of Pope John Paul II caused the first schism in the Roman Catholic Church since 1870, died today in Martigny, Switzerland. He was 85 years old.
Archbishop Lefebvre, a soft-spoken, stubborn Frenchman, was excommunicated in June 1988 for consecrating four bishops to help carry on his battle to return to a Latin Mass and to preserve other practices rejected in the wake of the ecumenical council Vatican II. 
 "I prefer to be in the truth without the Pope than to walk a false path with him," he said in explaining his rebellious course.
Archbishop Lefebvre died in a hospital of complications from the emergency surgery he underwent a week ago for a cancerous growth in his abdomen.
The Archbishop leaves behind about 300 priests ordained by his order, the Fraternity of St. Pius X, and a following that was estimated by Vatican officials at the time of the schism at 50,000 and 100,000. Church officials say the number has decreased since then as many Catholics have decided to stand behind the Pope rather than follow an excommunicated leader. The Archbishop's supporters say that he has hundreds of thousands of followers and that several million of the estimated 850 million Catholics worldwide sympathize with his teachings.
 
Schools in Five Countries
 His followers have set up schools and seminaries in Germany, the United States, Latin America, Australia and France, the country where he has the largest following.
His principal seminary is in Econe in southwestern Switzerland, where the gaunt, white-haired Archbishop carried out the fateful ceremony that created the church's first major split since the Old Catholics rejected the doctrine of papal infallibility declared at a Vatican council 121 years ago.
The Archbishop spent the last two decades battling changes in the doctrines of the church. For him, it was anathema that the church decided to open a dialogue with Protestants, Muslims and Jews, a move that he said mistakenly lent credibility to other religions. He rejected Vatican II's acceptance of "religious freedom," which he asserted was misguided because it put Catholicism on an equal footing with other faiths.
In a statement today, the Vatican defended the Pope's decision to excommunicate Archbishop Lefebvre, saying: "The Holy Father hoped until the last moment for a gesture that would put things in order. He showed that he was ready to remove the canonical penalty if there was such a sign."
The Vatican's statement added that on learning of the Archbishop's death, the Pope said a prayer "entrusting the soul of the deceased to the mercy of God."
The Rev. Franz Schmidberger, the German designated by Archbishop Lefebvre to succeed him as head of the dissident order, said, "May God reward him for his life entirely devoted to defend the Catholic faith against heresy."
Marcel Francois Lefebvre (pronounced luh-FEH-vruh) was born in Tourcoing in northeastern France on Nov. 29, 1905, the son of Rene and Gabrielle Lefebvre. His father, an official in a textile company, was a monarchist and a devout Catholic who said daily prayers in Latin. Of his seven brothers and sisters, four others became priests or nuns.
He attended a seminary in Rome that was headed by a sympathizer with Action Francaise, a far-right anti-Semitic and anti-democratic movement that was condemned by Pope Pius XI. He obtained doctorates in theology and philosophy before being ordained in 1929. He joined a missionary order, the Holy Ghost Fathers, and in 1932 was sent to Gabon, then a French colony. He spent most of the next three decades in Africa, and from 1955 to 1962 he was Archbishop of Dakar, Senegal. He left Senegal after it won independence.
In a move that chagrined many proponents of change, Pope John XXIII named him to the commission that prepared the Second Vatican Council. The bishops who attended the Council, which met from 1962 to 1965, rejected the traditionalist documents drafted by Archbishop Lefebvre and others, and that was the wedge that began to divide him from the church. Later he declared that "the devil" and "Antichrists" had inspired Vatican II.
He was especially disheartened with the abandonment of Mass said in Latin and other changes relating to the liturgy, including the placement of the altar so the celebrant faces the congregation. He also rejected Vatican II's affirmation of religious liberty and its abandonment of the church's assertion that it held the only universal truth.
 
Moral Deterioration Seen
 "The church in Africa was respected because it clearly told the truth," Archibishop Lefebvre said. "But Vatican II gave the impression that one truth could be as good as another. That has resulted in a general deterioration of moral values."
In 1969, he established the Fraternity of St. Pius X to train priests according to his traditional model. He lambasted the modern Mass, calling it a "bastard rite." As a result of his defiance, Pope Paul VI suspended him from his priestly work in 1976. This meant he could no longer celebrate Mass or administer the sacraments.
But he carried on in his crusade undeterred. He celebrated a Mass before 6,000 people in Lille, near his hometown, saying, "Let us carry on the religion of our fathers."
In 1978, John Paul II tried to establish a truce with the Archbishop, allowing him to resume his priestly functions. In 1988, the Pope sought to head off the schism by offering to name a traditionalist bishop whom Archbishop Lefebvre would nominate.
 
Pope's Compromise Rejected
 Eventually, the Archbishop rejected the compromise, which would not have obliterated the changes that he so disdained. This led to his consecration of the four bishops, a move that according to Catholic doctrine can be done only with the Pope's approval.
"It is to show our attachment to the Rome of forever that we perform this ceremony," he said.
In politics, he was known for extreme right-wing views. He occasionally supported Jean-Marie Le Pen, leader of the right-wing National Front, and often had kind words for Franco of Spain and the Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet. An avowed opponent of the French Revolution, he also supported the restoration of the French monarchy. "Our future is the past," he often said.
Church officials were uncertain how the Archbishop's death would affect his followers, whom Rome has threatened with excommunication. Jean-Michel Di Falco, spokesman for France's bishops, said, "One can hope that his death will be the occasion of a serious reflection and that perhaps a certain number of his followers are going to recognize that they are on a road that distances themselves from religion."

Analysts Split On G.M.'s Fate

BYLINE: By Doron P. Levin

DATELINE: DETROIT

 BODY:
AUTO MAKERS typically lose money in sour economies, then make it back in spades during prosperity. But the General Motors Corporation's $1.6 billion loss in the fourth quarter of 1990 was so staggering that it has split Wall Street over whether the No. 1 auto maker can recover its earning power when the economy improves.
G.M.'s profitability and dividend payout are critical issues for millions of investors. As one of the most widely held stocks and an institutional favorite, G.M. is the subject of much debate and strongly held opinions among financial analysts. The auto maker tracks the recommendations of 13 leading analysts; currently, 7 are recommending purchase of the stock, 3 are neutral and 3 are recommending sale. 
 The case against G.M. rests on disappointment among the analysts who expected narrower losses given the number of cars and trucks sold. They fear that the industry's three-year labor contract signed last fall, which guarantees most of the pay of hourly workers even if they are laid off, has turned a variable expense into a fixed expense. In past years, when sales slid, auto makers could reduce expenses by laying off workers.
Moreover, the North American production capacity of foreign auto makers continues to grow, making competition tougher. Consequently, auto makers have resorted to paying stiff consumer rebates to maintain sales volume. And the industry is facing soaring costs to meet new clean-air, safety and fuel-efficiency regulations.
True, G.M. is introducing a slew of new models, but the auto maker's overall market share has not gained, meaning that its models are cannibalizing sales from one another.
Yesterday, there was more negative news when Fitch Investors Service said it might downgrade its ratings on debt securities of G.M. and the Ford Motor Company, citing concern about their profitability. [Page D17.]
The cost and profit problems are affecting Ford and the Chrysler Corporation as well, but neither of those stocks is as significant as G.M. to institutional portfolios.
James L. Alexandre, automotive analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette in New York, suggests that G.M. is in danger of dropping to about $30 a share over the next year, as the company fails to turn profitable this year or next. Based on its earning power, it probably should not be trading higher than the mid-20's. Yesterday, the stock rose $1.75 to close at $39.50 on volume of 893,000 shares.
"G.M. simply can't generate the cash in an up automotive cycle to justify a raise in the dividend," said Ronald A. Glantz, automotive analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds in San Francisco. G.M. sliced its dividend almost 50 percent in February, and Mr. Glantz contends it cannot raise the payout before 1994, suggesting that the stock "should be trading in the 20's." He theorizes that G.M. stock is a favorite investment alternative to bonds and therefore trades mostly on its yield, rather than on growth prospects.
Citing a monitoring service to which he subscribes, Mr. Glantz said the large institutions had mostly remained on the sidelines as buyers of G.M. stock, while some smaller ones had become buyers.
The opposing view is that "it's dangerous to extrapolate from fourth-quarter results," in the words of Harvey Heinbach, automotive analyst for Merrill Lynch in New York. Although he was surprised by the magnitude of G.M.'s losses and has lowered his expectations for G.M. stock, he remains positive.
Scott Merlis, automotive analyst for Morgan Stanley & Company in New York, is one of Wall Street's bulls on G.M. In his view, the United States automotive market seems to be near its trough and should recover by 1992. While he agrees that G.M.'s recent losses are worrisome, he says, "You can't let the crisis obscure the long-term fundamental progress."
G.M. has been cutting costs, and the new labor contract, although expensive, has given the auto maker the flexibility to shut down underused capacity, he said. Rebates are down in the current quarter, and G.M. has joined Ford in promising to scale back market-glutting sales to rental fleets, which are no better than marginally profitable and hurt resale values.
David Healy, automotive analyst for Barclays de Zoete Wedd, agrees that G.M.'s profitability has been hurt, but he sees the situation as temporary. Weak demand, not excess capacity, is the big problem; it will disappear by 1992 or 1993, he projects, accompanied by higher capacity utilization, firmer pricing, better profits and, finally, a dividend increase.
G.M. will keep the $1.60 annual dividend through 1991, raise it to $2.40 in 1992 and $3 in 1993, he predicted.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Bailing Out Eastern Germany

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
GERMANY, where money talks and nobody walks, seems to have run out of economic miracles. Nine months after unification, the eastern provinces once known as the German Democratic Republic have tumbled into depression. With 30 percent of the labor force without full-time jobs and industrial production down by half, economic union threatens to become a black hole for taxpayers in western Germany.
In part the mess is simply a measure of the failure of the G.D.R's rulers, who would not give up their belief that Germans could even make socialism work. But in part, suggest four economists from the University of California at Berkeley, the post-unification collapse results from a self-defeating effort to squeeze western German living standards from the unproductive eastern German industrial machine. 
 The least expensive way to brake the economy's free fall, say George Akerlof, Andrew Rose, Janet Yellen and Helga Hessenius, is to subsidize wages. The financial crutch needed to save the jobs of most eastern Germans is a breathtaking three marks for every one paid by employers. But as the unpublished study explains, Germany is apparently committed to maintaining the living standard implied by the wage agreements negotiated since unification. The real choice, then, is whether taxpayers will subsidize an orderly (if expensive) restructuring of the eastern economy or pick up the tab for economic chaos.
A decline in output was inevitable in the wake of economic union, the Berkeley economists concede, as eastern German consumers loaded up on the VW's, Sonys and Big Macs so long denied them. But according to market tests, not every product made under the old regime deserves to be cast on the dung heap of history: before the fall, fully 21 percent of East Germany's G.N.P. was exported to non-socialist countries.
Thus the drop in production, they argue, can be attributed to the financial shock of unification. Even relatively efficient eastern German producers found they were unable to earn enough to pay their bills in German marks.
Factories have an incentive to keep their gates open as long as they can generate enough cash to hire labor, buy materials and perform minimal maintenance on the machinery. But at the wage levels decreed on the day of unification, the Berkeley economists calculate, conglomerates employing a mere 8 percent of the work force could cover their operating costs.
If labor markets in eastern Germany were truly competitive, wages would fall sharply, then gradually recover as the east-west gap in productivity narrowed. But the collapse in wages needed to restore high employment would hardly be acceptable to eastern German voters, whose gratitude offers the ruling Christian Democrats a lock on the chancellor's office.
Nor would a wage cut win friends among western German unions, who fear competition from eastern workers. Indeed, organized labor has been leading the charge for higher wages since unification. The powerful metal workers' union has even managed to ram through an agreement requiring equal pay for eastern and western Germans by 1994.
The way now to avoid a downward spiral in eastern employment and huge migration west, the economists argue, is to subsidize wages. Were Bonn to pay 75 percent of the conglomerates' current labor costs, they calculate that employers would be able to keep about 77 percent of the labor force on the job. The subsidy would equal tens of billions of dollars each year. But it would spare the Government the cost of generous unemployment compensation and lost payroll taxes, which together exceed the proposed 75 percent payout. And since the conglomerates are currently owned by the Government, the windfall in cheap labor gained by the minority of businesses that could get by with lower subsidies would go right back to the Treasury. In fact, subsidies that made the old conglomerates profitable would also make them salable, allowing Bonn to capture the windfall in the auction price.
The subsidy approach, the economists acknowledge, would encourage tough unions to get even tougher with east German enterprises. If Uncle Helmut is paying for 75 percent of the ride, why not insist on a seat in first class?
One way around the problem is to demand a social compact with labor as the price of the subsidy. Another, the economists suggest, would be to structure the aid in a way that discourages generous settlements. The deal might, for example, call for a four-mark subsidy cut for every five-mark increase in negotiated wages.
Another German miracle may yet be possible -- but not without a lot of help from Bonn.

Gold Prices Drop on Rumor Of Big Sales by the Soviets

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
A persistent rumor that the Soviet Union might be about to sell large quantities of bullion sent the prices of gold futures lower yesterday.
"There's nothing new here, but the Soviet stories just resurfaced," said Bette Raptopoulos, a metals analyst in New York with Prudential Securities Inc. 
 With oil production slumping, the Soviet Union needs hard currency to pay for its imports, she said. But there is no evidence that the Soviets are selling more gold than usual, she added.
Some Middle Eastern countries have been selling gold to pay for economic redevelopment after the Persian Gulf war. But here, too, the sales have been modest.
"The quantities are not large, but the perceptions that they might sell larger amounts of gold is moving the market," Ms. Raptopoulos said.
In addition to the rumors, the dollar's recent strength has continued to depress the gold market.
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery slipped $1.70 an ounce to settle at $357.30. The Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of $356.50 an ounce, down 75 cents from the late Monday bid.
Silver and platinum futures also moved lower, failing to respond to a couple of mildly encouraging economic reports. These included an improved consumer confidence index and a more restrained decline than expected in the sales of durable goods.
Gasoline futures led energy prices higher on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
With the market expecting a weekly industry report to show a decline in gasoline stocks, futures advanced more than a penny a gallon before giving up some of the gains.
When the American Petroleum Institute released its data after the close, it showed a much larger decline in gasoline stocks -- 4.54 million barrels -- than had been expected. Further, crude oil stocks also declined, whereas an increase had been expected.
Light sweet crude oil settled 14 cents to 31 cents higher, with the May contract at $19.76 a barrel; heating oil was 0.14 cent to 0.75 cent higher, with April at 56.80 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 0.50 cent to 0.84 cent higher, with April at 70.48 cents a gallon, and natural gas was 1.2 cent lower to 0.8 cent higher, with May at $1.395 for 1,000 cubic feet.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
The Dollar Is Mostly Lower But Gains Against the Mark

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar slipped against most foreign currencies yesterday, but rose against the German mark amid perceptions of continued weakness in the German economy.
The United States currency opened higher, following a surge overseas. But it lost ground as leading currencies posted higher gains against the mark, which has been hurt by signs of growing economic weakness in Germany. 
 The dollar closed slightly below 1.7000 marks -- the American currency's highest level against the mark in nearly a year.
"There was a lot of music," said James Maccario, vice president in foreign exchange at Shawmut Bank of Boston. "I don't know if a lot of people were dancing."
That the dollar did not gain more was attributed in part to a movement of investments into the Swiss franc and the Japanese yen, whose strong performances stole some of the spotlight from the dollar.
In addition, Mr. Maccario said, "the market has been messy for the past weak or so, which tends to take people out."
Dollar buyers were encouraged by two economic releases yesterday that raised hopes for a swift economic recovery. The Commerce Department reported that factory orders edged down three-tenths of a percent in February. It was the third decline in the last four months, but not as great as the expected 1 percent drop.
In addition, the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index jumped to 81 in March from 59.4 in February. It was the largest single month-to-month gain in the 24-year history of the survey.
In Tokyo, the dollar rose to close at 138.50 yen, up from 137.90 yen at Monday's close. Later, in London, it closed at 138.35 yen. In New York trading, the dollar closed at 138.80 yen, down from late Monday's 139.20 yen.
In London, the pound fell to $1.7545, from $1.7635 late Monday. But the pound gained in New York, closing at $1.7580, more expensive than the $1.7477 of late Monday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday, included: 1.6870 marks, up from 1.6865; 1.4330 Swiss francs, down from 1.4370; 5.7240 French francs, down from 5.7265; 1,253.00 Italian lire, unchanged, and 1.1602 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1618.
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Monday, were: 1.6900 marks, up from 1.6710; 1.4350 Swiss francs, up from 1.4285; 5.7370 French francs, up from 5.6740; 1.9055 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8830; 1,255.25 Italian lire, up from 1,241.75, and 1.1598 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1603.

HEADLINE: Court Lets Japanese Concern Buy U.S. Company

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 26

 BODY:
A Federal District Court has blocked an attempt by the Justice Department to prevent the sale of an American high-technology company to a Japanese bidder. The American company plays a central role in the semiconductor industry's efforts to overtake Japanese rivals.
The decision today by the Federal Court of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania is expected to spur debate in Congress on legislation that would make it harder for foreign companies to buy American high-technology companies that are deemed crucial to the nation's economic security. 
 In a ruling from the bench, Judge Clifford S. Green denied the Justice Department's request for a preliminary injunction against the sale of Semi-Gas Systems of San Jose, Calif., to Matheson Gas Products of Secaucus, N.J., a subsidiary of Nippon Sanso K.K., based in Tokyo.
 
Planning to Close Sale
 Semi-Gas is a subsidiary of Hercules Inc., of Wilmington, Del. Robert B. Hessler, director of the company's financial public relations, said after the ruling that Hercules and Matheson "are now discussing when to close the sale."
"We have maintained all along that there is nothing wrong with the sale and are delighted that the court has corroborated our opinion," he added.
The Justice Department intervened on antitrust grounds after President Bush went along with an interagency committee's recommendation last year that the deal posed no threat to national security under the Exon-Florio legislation of 1988, which authorized the President to prevent sales that would hurt the nation's defense.
The sale has been closely followed in Congress because of the sharp opposition to the deal from Sematech, the Government-industry alliance to bolster the nation's computer chip-making technology. Sematech has strong Congressional backing.
Semi-Gas, which has been a supplier to the consortium, makes gas cabinets used in the production of advanced computer chips.
The Justice Department said the transaction would combine the world's two leading suppliers of gas distribution and control systems to computer chip makers and would substantially increase Semi-Gas's dominant position in the United States market.
The judge denied the request for a preliminary injunction on the ground that the Justice Department had not sufficently shown that the sale would result in the purported unlawful market concentration of gas cabinets.
"The Government has not established a basis for this court to find that there is a reasonable probability that the proposed acquisition may substantially lessen competition in the United States gas cabinet market," the judge said.
The department could appeal the decision. A spokeswoman, Gina Talamona, said officials were "reviewing the opinion and considering our options."
The antitrust move represented a last-ditch effort to block the sale by opponents within the Administration.
"The ball is back in the court of Congress," said Bradley R. Larschan, acting managing director and general counsel of the Association for International Investment.
Congressional Democrats, including Senator Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee and the House majority leader, Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, are expected to move to broaden the Exon-Florio legislation and require that the President weigh the economic consequences, as well as national security, as a consideration in reviewing foreign investment.
Congressional analysts predict big battles with the Bush Administration, which generally favors free investment as well as the free flow of trade.
Under the more narrowly confined 1988 law, there have been 540 reviews of foreign takeovers and 12 full-scale investigations by the interagency Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.
But President Bush has blocked only one sale -- the purchase by the China National Aero-technology Import and Export Corporation, owned by the Beijing Government, of Mamco Manufacturing Inc. of Seattle, which supplies aircraft components.
As that sale had already been consummated, it required a divestment that was completed only last week when a New York venture capital company, Vestar Capital Partners Inc., acquired it from the Chinese.
Senator Gore characterized the Semi-Gas sale as "a serious loss which occurred because the Administration failed to understand what was at stake until the antitrust objection was the only one left to make."
A spokesman for Mr. Gephardt said today's actions "will increase support" for the investment legislation he expects to introduce "within the next couple of months."

HEADLINE: Rifle Lobby Torn by Dissidents and Capitol Defectors

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 26

 BODY:
With new gun control legislation pending in both the House and the Senate, the National Rifle Association is in the grip of internal turmoil and there are signs that it may be losing some of its effectiveness as one of the nation's most powerful lobbying organizations.
Long considered a muscular presence on Capitol Hill, the rifle association is an increasingly troubled organization these days. 
 It has lost more than 300,000 members in the last two years as membership has fallen to 2.6 million. It is torn by factional strife, with a group of dissidents deriding the current leadership as being too moderate. Facing complaints of mismanagement and sexual improprieties, the association's executive vice president, J. Warren Cassidy, resigned last month under pressure from the board of directors, former officials of the organization say.
When the association holds its annual convention next month in San Antonio, a major topic will be who should be named as permanent successor to Mr. Cassidy. The post, to be filled by the board, is the organization's top staff job. The group will also try to develop strategies to counter the growing perception that its ability to persuade or coerce lawmakers into supporting its positions is waning.
 
Organization Remains Powerful
 To be sure, no one is suggesting that the association is toothless, and it is mainly its critics who promote the idea of a weakened organization. The group retains the ability to punish some of its political enemies and reward some of its friends. And, despite some early setbacks in Congress, like Senate approval last May of a ban on the manufacture and sale of nine types of semiautomatic weapons, no gun control measures were voted into law last year.
Still, with its antagonists better organized than ever before, with many law enforcement groups willing to actively lobby on behalf of gun control measures that the association opposes, and with the nation shaken by an epidemic of violence, lawmakers and others are questioning whether the group's influence has diminished on Capitol Hill.
The pending gun control legislation poses a major test for the association. Just last week, Representative Les AuCoin, a Democrat from Oregon who had been a staunch N.R.A. adherent, announced he would support a bill requiring anyone buying a pistol to wait seven days to conclude the sale. Mr. AuCoin said he was switching because of concerns over the rising level of violent crime in the country.
"I have told myself that gun control isn't crime control," Mr. AuCoin said at a news conference. "But more and more, the argument in my own ears sounded threadbare."
The bill would allow, but would not require, background checks by local law-enforcement agencies to determine if a potential handgun buyer has a criminal record, is a fugitive from justice or has ever been committed to a mental institution.
The measure, which has drawn bitter criticism from the rifle association, is known as the Brady bill, after President Ronald Reagan's press secretary, James Brady, who was critically wounded in the head in an attempt to assassinate the President in 1981. The attack left Mr. Brady with brain damage and unable to walk.
 
'Out of Step' Leadership
 Mr. AuCoin, who opposed the Brady bill last year before switching his view, said he believed that the rifle association no longer inspired the fear among legislators that it once did. "The N.R.A.'s leadership is so far out of step with thoughtful people that any choke hold it had is, in fact, broken." he said.
Mr. AuCoin is not alone in that view. Last year's Senate bill to ban some semiautomatic weapons was sponsored by a lifetime N.R.A. member, Dennis DeConcini, Democrat of Arizona.
When she was on the New York City Council, Susan Molinari of Staten Island opposed a nonbinding resolution urging Congress to ban semiautomatic weapons. For that, the rifle association supported her election to the House of Representatives. But when she arrived there last March, she immediately became a sponsor of the Brady bill. For that, she has been denounced by the association as a turncoat. Denying the charge, she said of the N.R.A., "They put a lot of legislators in very untenable positions."
If some lawmakers view the association as too extreme in its general opposition to gun control, the organization is, paradoxically, facing another challenge from within its ranks from dissidents who assert that it is losing its punch because it has grown too moderate.
"We had the image of a winner," said Neal Knox, a former official of the association. "Now we have the image of someone you can roll over like AuCoin did the other day."
Mr. Knox and others maintain that in recent years, the organization's policies have become weak and contradictory. Mr. Knox points out that the association supported a 15-day waiting period in Oregon, while opposing a national 7-day waiting period.
Current officials of the group declined requests for interviews and would respond only in writing to written questions by a reporter.
 
Reasons for Resignation
 Former officials say Mr. Cassidy was forced to resign because of anger over the drop in membership and problems with a new $10 million computer system that was supposed to be in operation by December 1990, but is still not working. The association says delay is common in installing a new computer system.
Mr. Cassidy was also under fire as a result of the settlement, reported to be $500,000, of a lawsuit charging the association with sex discrimination in dismissing a female employee. Among the charges leveled by the dismissed employee, Marsha A. Beasley, was that Mr. Cassidy favored female employees "who would deal with him on other than a professional basis."
Mr. Cassidy, who denied the charge in court papers, is now a consultant to the rifle association. He could not be reached for comment, and he did not respond to requests for interviews relayed through the association. He had previously cited "personal reasons" for his decision to resign.
Critics of Mr. Cassidy say he would have survived any embarrassment from the lawsuit were it not for the decline in membership, which fell to 2.6 million last fall from 2.9 million in 1989, internal N.R.A. documents show.
 
Decline in Membership
 Gary Anderson, acting executive vice president, confirmed the decline, attributing it to "the economy and the recession." He said a $5 rise in annual dues to $25 in July 1989 had a major effect on membership.
"There is no indiciation that membership declines over all are due to N.R.A. positions deemed either too strident or too compromising," he said.
The disssidents, led by Mr. Knox, have complained that under Mr. Cassidy, the association has been too willing to agree to support laws like the ban voted by Congress on the manufacture and sale of armor-piercing ammunition and a law passed two years ago in Oregon that requires a 15-day waiting period and a background check for people who buy pistols.
The rifle association supported passage of the Oregon law as part of a compromise that established uniform statewide standards for permits to carry concealed weapons. The group's leaders insist that the Oregon statute is a true anti-crime law, since it requires background checks. In contrast, such checks are optional under the Brady bill, which the association says is just a nuisance that serves no purpose.

HEADLINE: HUNGRY CHILDREN PUT AT 5.5 MILLION

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 26

 BODY:
A field network of researchers estimated today that 5.5 million people under 12 years of age were hungry in the United States.
The study, by the Food Research and Action Center, a nonprofit anti-hunger group, was based on interviews with 2,335 low-income households at seven places around the country. The authors of the study called it the most comprehensive effort to date to measure hunger in America. 
 The study defined hunger as periodic food shortages resulting from a family's limited economic resources. It did not attempt to measure clinical malnutrition. Families were classified as hungry if they answered yes to five of eight standard questions like these: "Thinking about the past 12 months, did your household ever run out of money to buy food to make meals? Did you ever cut the size of your children's meals, or did they skip meals because there was not enough money for food?"
Robert J. Fersh, executive director of the Food Research and Action Center, said the findings suggest that one in eight children in the United States experiences hunger each year.
 
The Government's Response
 Catherine A. Bertini, Assistant Secretary of Agriculture for Food and Consumer Services, welcomed the efforts to measure hunger. But, in a telephone interview from Columbia, S.C., where she was examining local social services, she said, "I cannot endorse the numbers in the report because I cannot say the numbers are either correct or incorrect."
Bush Administration officials refrained from criticizing the report, saying they did not want discussion of hunger to degenerate into a debate over numbers or the proper technique for measuring the problem. Ms. Bertini said the Administration, like the authors of the report, was eager to provide "adequate services to children at risk of hunger."
The report does not have the imprimatur of a Federal agency; the Government does not collect such data. The Food Research and Action Center, a 20-year-old foundation-supported organization, is an advocacy group in that it seeks to eradicate hunger and malnutrition. But the authors said they tried to make the study as reliable as possible and solicited expert advice on statistical technique.
Cheryl A. Wehler, director of the study, known as the Community Childhood Hunger Identification Project, said, for example, that follow-up interviewers were sent to each household to verify answers to key questions.
 
Findings Seen as Plausible
 And epidemiologists and other experts on public health said the findings of the report were plausible, given that hunger is highly correlated with poverty and that 9.4 million children under 12 are classified as poor by the Census Bureau.
Mr. Fersh said the hunger estimates were conservative because the interviews were conducted from February 1989 to August 1990, before the onset of the current recession, and because homeless people were excluded from the door-to-door survey.
Families classified in the study as hungry typically said they had experienced food shortages on seven days in the month preceding the interviews.
The study said hungry children were two to three times as likely as other children to experience such health problems as unwanted weight loss, fatigue, irritability and headaches.
 
More Food Stamp Recipients
 Federal figures show that the number of people receiving food stamps increased to 21.4 million at the end of last year, from 19.4 million in December 1989. The Agriculture Department says that half of food stamp recipients are children under 18.
The study by the Food Research and Action Center found that the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants and Children, known as WIC, served 45 percent of those eligible for assistance. Ms. Bertini said she believed that the program serves 55 percent of those eligible.
The study found that among those interviewed, almost one-third of the families participating in the WIC program said they were hungry. More generally, the study said: "Hungry households spend nearly one-third of their gross monthly income on food, and yet this amounts to an average of only 68 cents per person per meal."
Mr. Fersh said the study cost $1 million. Kraft General Foods, a division of Philip Morris Companies Inc., helped pay for the survey through contributions to the Food Research and Action Center.
 
Where Interviews Were Held
 Each household in the survey was asked 105 questions in an interview lasting about an hour. The interviews were conducted in Hennepin County, Minn., which includes Minneapolis; Pontiac, Mich.; Suffolk County, on Long Island; Hartford; Polk County, Fla.; Sumter County, Ala., and four counties in California -- Fresno, Kings, Stanislaus and Tulare.
G. Ted Fairchild, director of the WIC program in Utah, who served as a member of the technical advisory group for the study, said the seven sites were chosen to reflect a variety of urban, suburban and rural neighborhoods. "We do not claim that this is a nationally representative sample, but it does reflect the variety of conditions in which poor people live," he said.
The interviews were conducted by various nonprofit groups, including the Alabama Coalition Against Hunger and the Nutrition Consortium of New York State, using the same questionnaires and the same procdures, Ms. Wehler said.
Members of Congress from both parties said they planned to use the report to buttress the case for gradually expanding food assistance programs like food stamps and the school breakfast program.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR;
U.S., FEARING IRAQI BREAKUP, IS TERMED READY TO ACCEPT A HUSSEIN DEFEAT OF REBELS

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 26

 BODY:
President Bush has decided to let President Saddam Hussein put down rebellions in his country without American intervention rather than risk the splintering of Iraq, according to official statements and private briefings today.
The White House said publicly that it will stay out of Iraq's internal strife, despite reports of atrocities by Mr. Hussein's forces, and a senior official said the American military has no plans to act on a warning to Iraq not to use combat helicopters against the insurgents. The United States acknowledges that Iraq has defied that warning. 
 The assertion that the Administration has decided not to make any new moves to protect Iraqi rebel forces at this time reflects a conclusion that the insurgents cannot control all of Iraq and would only succeed in fracturing the country, officials said.
 
Political Effect Considered
 Mr. Bush also believes that an overt American move to support the rebels would be opposed by Washington's Arab allies, stir up domestic political opposition and spoil hopes for progress on other regional issues, a senior official said.
That policy was reaffirmed today at a meeting of President Bush's seven top military and national security advisers, officials said, during which the President and his aides also completed preparations for a cease-fire resolution that is to be offered to the United Nations Security Council this week.
Although the current draft of that resolution imposes somewhat less stringent terms on Iraq than Washington originally wanted, the United States believes that it will be able to insure the destruction of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction and continue a campaign of political and economic pressure aimed at weakening Mr. Hussein's position, the officials continued.
 
Status of Kirkuk
 Mr. Bush was also informed about the fighting in Iraq, where the United States today said Kurdish rebels in the north had seized the city of Kirkuk, an important gain.
But the Pentagon raised doubts about whether the rebels controlled Kirkuk's airfield. Officials said the Baghdad Government's military forces had not yet fully engaged the Kurds and were instead protecting important installations and oilfields.
In the south, the Pentagon said, Iraqi forces were continuing to reassert control over areas briefly held by Shiite Muslim rebels backed by Iran.
Concerned by mounting questions about the Administration's intentions toward the rebellions in Iraq, Mr. Bush and his advisers sent Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, into the briefing room after today's meeting to issue a statement intended to dampen speculation that the United States might move to further support the Iraqi insurgents.
Though American spokesmen used imprecise language to describe the policy on the helicopters, it amounted to a decision, at least temporarily, to let Mr. Hussein freely deal with internal dissent.
"We never made any promises to these people," the senior official said, adding: "Frankly, there is complete agreement in this Government that the American people have absolutely no stomach for a major military operation to dictate the outcome of a political struggle in Iraq. There is no interest in the coalition in further military operations."
 
Hopes of a Palace Coup
 The official, who was familiar with today's meeting, said the United States would continue to urge Mr. Hussein's ouster by his own people and would maintain its policy of putting pressure on the Iraqi leader through the United Nations. The calculation is that if the insurrections fail, as officials here increasingly believe they will, Mr. Hussein's own political organization will remove him.
"We don't want Iraq dismembered, since that would go counter to the reason we fought the war," another official said. "Let Hussein deal with this, then the dust will settle and he's going to have to pay the piper for the war over Kuwait. Or at least, that is what we are counting on."
Thus, the senior official said that while the United States would continue to shoot down Iraqi fighters and bombers, it would not attack helicopters unless they directly threaten allied forces.
"The contrast in the way we have responded to fixed-wing operations and helicopter operations is probably going to continue," he said, acknowledging that permitting use of the helicopters could enhance Mr. Hussein's chances of success against the rebels.
Officially, Mr. Fitzwater said that Mr. Bush was deliberately leaving his intentions "murky." But he pointedly added that the United States did not intend to interfere with Baghdad's attempts to put down the rebellion and did not consider the helicopters a threat to allied forces.
Mr. Fitzwater sought to play down the notion that the flights by the Iraqi copters against insurgent troops violated any formal agreement between Iraq and the coalition. He said that Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, the allied commander, agreed in a desert meeting on March 3 to an Iraqi request to use its helicopters to ferry troops and supplies as "a side oral discussion, nothing in writing."
But Mr. Fitzwater's explanation was in direct conflict with a reassertion today by the Pentagon spokesman, Pete Williams, that armed-helicopter flights would be considered a threat to coalition forces.
General Schwarzkopf said in a television interview to be broadcast on Wednesday that he felt fooled by the Iraqi generals with whom he negotiated.
"I think I was suckered because I think they intended -- right then, when they asked that question -- to use those helicopters against the insurrections that were going on," he said. "I think that absolutely was their intention."
Since the war with Iraq ended, the White House has said that American forces would remain in the allies' zone of occupation in southern Iraq until a formal cease-fire was signed on the basis of the new Security Council resolution.
Mr. Fitzwater said today that the deployment in Iraq could last until a United Nations observer force is in place. But Administration officials said in public and in private that President Bush was eager to pull American troops out of Iraq as quickly as possible.
However, Gen. Colin L. Powell, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said on Friday that this could take months.
In Iraq today, the insurgents continued to declare major advances against the Baghdad Government's forces. The Associated Press reported from the town of Zakho that the pre-eminent Kurdish leader, Jalal Talabani, head of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, returned today to northern Iraq and proclaimed that "the whole of Iraqi Kurdistan has been liberated."
"We will continue the struggle until we defeat the regime of oppression in Baghdad and liberate the whole of Iraq," he told a crowd of about 10,000 in Zakho's main square, according to The A.P. report.
 
Accounts of Brutality and Death
 The agency reported from southern Iraq that refugees fleeing the fighting between Government and rebel forces said that Iraqi troops roam the streets of cities ordering young men to join the army or face execution.
Referring to the city of Basra, Khalifa Rahim, one of 26 Iraqi soldiers who surrendered on Monday to American forces, was quoted as saying, "They keep 7,000 prisoners at a university, and they shoot about 50 to 100 every day."
The A.P. said other refugees recounted military brutality. It said that Dr. Makki Jaffar Taher, a civilian, broke into tears as he said: "I lost my wife and children when my house was bombed. I have nothing left."
Iraq has not allowed foreign journalists to visit the rebellious areas, but Mr. Fitzwater said the United States Government had received such reports of Iraqi atrocities. He said that would not change the policy of noninterference.
"I think it's safe to assume that in the kind of warfare being conducted by the rebel forces and the Kurds, as well as by the Government of Iraq, as well as by other groups, that there are all sorts of atrocities and war repercussions taking place -- yes," the spokesman said. "But it is our belief that the best policy is not to involve ourselves in those internal conflicts."

Fitch Ratings Agency Gives Warning on G.M. and Ford

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, March 26

 BODY:
Fitch Investors Serviceei, expressing concern about the profitability of the nation's two largest auto makers, said today that it might reduce the senior debt ratings of the Ford Motor Company and the General Motors Corporation.
Fitch said the AA senior debt rating of G.M. and the AA senior debt rating of Ford had been placed on an "alert" status with negative implications. A spokesman said the intention was to alert investors that the ratings might be lowered after further discussions with the companies, which will take place within two weeks. 
 Fitch said the ratings of the auto makers' finance subsidiaries were also put on alert status with negative implications because of their close integration with the parent companies. The senior debt of the General Motors Acceptance Corporation is rated AA, and that of the Ford Motor Credit Company is rated AA-.
G.M. and its finance subsidiary have about $69 billion of debt securities outstanding; the figure for Ford and its finance subsidiary is about $53.5 billion, a Fitch spokesman said.
"The severe cyclical contraction in North American auto sales has exposed cost structures unsuited to the changing competitive conditions in that market," the ratings service said in its bulletin. Fitch said the auto makers were cutting costs but that it was not clear whether "profitability can be restored to former levels."
On Jan. 24, Fitch lowered the debt ratings of the Chrysler Corporation and the Chrysler Financial Corporation.
Terrence Sullivan, a G.M. spokesman, said: "G.M. and its management has laid out an aggressive plan to restore its profitability in its core automotive business. The entire G.M. team is determined to pull together to cut costs and conserve cash while reinforcing a forward product program."
A Ford spokesman said: "The problems we face are largely cyclical. We have a $3 billion cost reduction under way to improve profits and cash flow."

HEADLINE: Connecticut Tax Hearing: What, No Rage?

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, March 26

 BODY:
By 5 P.M. the barricades set up to contain the crowds stood empty, and the State Capitol police officers assigned to guard the doors to Room 2C had long since wandered off. The signs warning people against cheering or other "public demonstrations" were superfluous in a room that had been largely empty of spectators since midday.
It was near the end of a long-anticipated one-day public hearing on Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr.'s tax plan, which had been expected to go late into the night, but little opposition to a state income tax had appeared: only half a dozen people out of 62 speakers. 
 More important, the powerful voices of organized labor, big business and private welfare agencies, which usually agree on nothing, had all supported a broad-based personal income tax on wages in one form or another.
 
Individual Protests Heard
 There were individual voices of anguish. Theater owners protested that the Governor's plan to extend the sales tax to movie tickets would hurt them. Lawyers said that extending the sales tax to legal services would provoke a constitutional challenge. State employees said the cuts in their benefits proposed by Mr. Weicker were too harsh.
But three of the state's largest business lobbying groups, which announced on Monday that they would support an income tax if it were linked to controls on state spending, found themselves in the unusual position of being criticized by the Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee's Republicans, their usual allies.
One citizen group calling itself the Taxpayers Alliance to Serve Connecticut distributed income-tax tea bags to evoke the Boston Tea Party as a way of supporting, not opposing, an income tax.
People who remembered Connecticut's last big experiment with the income tax -- in 1971, when the General Assembly enacted the tax and then repealed it under a storm of protest, including a rally of 10,000 people on the Capitol lawn -- wondered aloud if Connecticut's taxpayers were whipped, or apathetic, or just lying in wait.
"It seems like times have changed," said one committee member, Representative Geri W. Langlois, a Democrat from Thompson, in questioning one witness. "Where's the outcry?"
The witness didn't know.
Some income-tax opponents said the hearing was irrelevant and that those opposed were smart to stay home.
"It's a meaningless dog and pony show," said former State Senator Thomas Scott, the chairman of the Connecticut Taxpayers Committee, which opposes an income tax. "Eighty percent of my members are factory workers. They don't have time for this."
 
Protest Petitions Promised
 Mr. Scott, a Republican who formed his committee this year after an unsuccessful run for the United States House of Representatives against Rosa DeLauro, said he had obtained 40,000 signatures on petitions condemning an income tax and would return to the Capitol when he had 100,000. One day's testimony, he said, will change no minds.
But the finance commitee's co-chairman, Representative Richard T. Mulready, a Democrat from West Hartford, said he thought the low turnout itself would send a message as the General Assembly grinds through the tax debate this spring.
Mr. Mulready, who supports a broad-based personal income tax, had been prepared to work well into the night, hearing the complaints and accusations of hundreds of people. Instead he was back in his office, files packed away, well before 6:30.
Of the more than 115 people on the sign-up sheet, only 62 had stepped up to the table to speak.
 
Resigned Feeling Detected
 "That suggests to me -- though I think it may be a little premature to draw conclusions -- that the people of the state of Connecticut are resigned," Mr. Mulready said. "Not apathetic, but resigned is probably the best way to look at it."
What perhaps also discouraged some would-be speakers were the questions from the finance committee members, who invariably asked every speaker how the state's projected $2.4 billion revenue shortfall should be addressed if an income tax were rejected.
Some opponents of the income tax did not have an answer, while others said the budget was still full of fat despite the $1.2 billion in spending reductions identified by Mr. Weicker in a preliminary budget of about $8.5 billion.
One speaker, Elizabeth Gillern, said she had formed her group, Citizens Against an Income Tax, only three weeks ago and had not had the time or resources to find the answers yet.
"The reality of it is, there is just no more money to give," she said.
 
A Happy Taxpayer Speaks
 More representative of the hearing's tone was the testimony -- and sharp questioning -- of Sharon Palmer, representing the 20,000-member Connecticut Federation of Teachers. She spoke passionately in favor of a progressive income tax as the best way to raise revenue to support education.
"How much taxes are you personally willing to pay?" asked one committee member, Representative Arthur O'Neill, a Republican from Southbury.
"Whatever it takes," Ms. Palmer said.
"You willing to pay an extra $1,500 a year in taxes?" Mr. O'Neill asked.
"Yes, I am," she said.
Mr. Weicker, an independent third-party governor with no members of his own Connecticut Party on the finance commitee or in the General Assembly as a whole, proposed last month a flat 6 percent tax on all income over $25,000 for a family or $12,500 for an individual. The wage tax, he said, would allow other taxes to be lowered -- especially those paid by business -- to stimulate the state's flagging economy.
 
Flat vs. Variable Tax
 The corporate profits tax would be cut from 13.8 percent to 11.5 percent, the sales tax from 8 percent to 4.25 percent, and the separate taxes on dividends, interest and capital gains would be eliminated, with all income treated equally under the new tax.
One of the main side debates in today's lopsided discussion was whether the flat rate was best or whether the income-tax rate should go up with income, the way New York State's does, for example.
John R. Rathgeber, an executive vice president of the Connecticut Business and Industry Association, said his 7,000-member group would support only a flat tax.
The president of the State A.F.L.-C.I.O., John W. Olsen, said he would make the tax steeply progressive, hitting upper-income earners with a 10 percent wage tax and sparing the middle class.

HEADLINE: Brady Sees No Bailout Of Banks

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 26

 BODY:
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said today that no taxpayer bailout of the nation's banks would be necessary if Congress approved the Administration's proposed banking legislation and if the economy avoided a complete collapse.
In an interview in his office, Mr. Brady gave an upbeat appraisal of economic prospects, but he suggested that the Federal Reserve could prolong the recession if it became "preoccupied with inflation" and kept interest rates too high. 
 Over the course of an hour, Mr. Brady addressed these other topics:
*The Resolution Trust Corporation, the agency overseeing the savings and loan bailout, will not be able to go out of business by the summer of 1992 as the law requires, and new legislation will be needed to allow the agency to continue to take over failed institutions after that.
*The United States should not help rebuild Iraq, as it did Germany and Japan after World War II, as long as Saddam Hussein is in power.
*The Secretary expects that a report from his staff within the next day or so will show that Mr. Hussein has assets hidden in the United States and other Western countries.
*The United States will not give new credits and other financial benefits to the Soviet Union in the immediate future because of the Soviet crackdown in the Baltic states.
*If Congress passes legislation to cut Social Security taxes, he will advise President Bush to veto it.
 
Fears of a Bailout
 Some officials say that so many banks will fail in the next year or two that the bank insurance fund will become insolvent. The Government would then have to step in and pay off the depositors, as it has done in the savings and loan industry at a cost of up to $500 billion.
Mr. Brady said he was "very close to promising" that a taxpayer bailout of the banks would not occur unless the economy performed much worse than expected and "you have a pusillanimous reaction by Congress" to the Administration's banking proposal.
The central parts of the proposed legislation would permit banks to open branches nationwide and allow mergers between commercial banks and other institutions like investment banks, brokerage houses and even industrial companies.
Interstate banking stands a good chance of being approved by Congress, but passage of the mergers proposal is much more in doubt.
Mr. Brady seemed of two minds about whether he should take an all-or-nothing approach toward the legislation or settle for the parts he can get from Congress quickly and abandon the rest.
At one point, he said he would not make the "mistake" of agreeing to tackle the elements of the measure piecemeal. But later in the interview, he said: "I'm not naive enough to think that when you put legislation in, there won't be changes in it. Of course, there will be."
Agreeing with many economists, Mr. Brady said he expected the recession to end by midsummer, and he said he was spotting some encouraging signs. "Oil prices are down; interest rates are down; consumer confidence has taken a bounce back; home sales were up," he said. "So the leading indicators are leading."
"If the economy is managed properly," he said, "we can have an upward-sloping economy, hopefully in the 2 to 3 percent range, over a long period of time."
But Mr. Brady said the recession was brought on in part because the Federal Reserve kept interest rates too high in 1989 and the first half of 1990, and he worried aloud that the central bank might keep rates too high this spring and summer out of concern over inflation.
The Government reported last week that consumer prices rose by two-tenths of a percent in February and that when energy and food prices were excluded, they rose by seven-tenths of a percent. Many economists said they found the latter figure to be a troubling indication of incipient inflation, but Mr. Brady said he did not. He said the increase resulted primarily from one-time jumps in the cost of postage stamps and the excise tax on cigarettes.
Mr. Brady said that inflation was now primarily "within the services area" and that he had tried to convince Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, that higher interest rates would not bring down this kind of inflation.
The Federal Open Market Committee, the policy-making arm of the Federal Reserve, met today, but its decisions on what to do about interest rates might not be known for some time. The prevailing view on Wall Street is that the central bank will not make any moves for at least another couple of weeks while it tries to get a better reading of how the economy is performing.
"We ought to be focusing on growth," Mr. Brady said, "not inflation."
Even if the recession lingered longer than he expected, the Secretary said, he did not foresee the Administration offering any measures like extended unemployment benefits in response. He said experience had shown that such steps would not become effective until the rebound was well under way. "I don't think we ought to be pouring gasoline on an already-starting fire," he said.

HEADLINE: Banc One Won't Make Bid

 BODY:
The Banc One Corporation of Columbus, Ohio, said yesterday that it would not, as had been expected, bid for the banks of the failed Bank of New England Corporation. It cited the weak state of the New England economy as the reason for its decision.
"We had no sense of when the region would get better, or if it had already bottomed out," said William Boardman, a Banc One executive who has arranged dozens of acquisitions in the last decade. Over the next several years, "we think there are going to be other opportunities that are probably a better use of our resources," he added.
Bids for the Bank of New England's failed subsidiaries in Massachusetts, Maine and Connecticut are due on Friday, with the winner to be announced in mid-April. In addition to the BankAmerica Corporation, which has said it will bid for all the banks, analysts have said the Bank of Boston Corporation, the Chase Manhattan Corporation, the Fleet/Norstar Financial Group and Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company are interested in some of the banks.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Midway Enters Bankruptcy And Obtains a Line of Credit

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS

 BODY:
Midway Airlines, the first large carrier to start flying after deregulation in 1979, filed yesterday for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code.
The airline said, however, that it would continue to operate and that it had arranged a $40 million line of credit, while it seeks to bring down its costs and debt. 
 David R. Hinson, Midway's chairman and chief executive, said, "We're committed to the maintenance of our published schedules and to honor all passenger reservations and tickets."
He added that Midway had to file for bankruptcy protection before Continental Bank would extend credit. The step makes the bank the first claim on the airline's assets in repaying money owed. Similarly, Pan American World Airways filed for Chapter 11 protection to get a $150 million loan from Bankers Trust.
In a news conference, Mr. Hinson said that the airline would break even in March and that current bookings were at a high.
"Our wish is to emerge from this financial reorganization as quickly as possible," he said. "We got into a situation where circumstances overwhelmed us."
The bankruptcy filing, made Monday night, will enable the carrier to shrink its operations and restructure its finances, Mr. Hinson said.
Several analysts said that the carrier, whose main hub is at Midway Airport in Chicago, had a chance to reorganize and come out bankruptcy, but that much would depend on the economy.
"Unless there is a traffic recovery by June, then the likelihood of a successful reorganization is dim," said Julius Maldutis of Salomon Brothers Inc.
Midway's shares fell $1.25 each yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, to $2.625. The percentage drop, of 32.3 percent, was the Big Board's largest.
What put Midway into its precarious position was an attempt to seize the opportunity from the troubles at Eastern Airlines to build a second hub in Philadelphia. Eastern had to keep selling assets to cover its losses, while it tried to revive under the protection of Chapter 11, and Midway was able to buy landing slots, gates, international routes and planes from Eastern for more than $200 million.
The move made strategic sense, but Midway ran into fierce competition from USAir, which did not want another carrier on its turf. USAir, which had also sought Eastern's assets, built up its service at the hub.
In addition, Eastern, which is now being liquidated, cut fares to $79 one way between the Northeast and Florida in a desperate move to win back traffic. That put competitive pressure on Midway.
 
Final Blow: Fuel Prices
 The final blow to Midway came with the crisis in the Persian Gulf, which sent jet fuel prices soaring while traffic began to fall -- "both things they had no control over," Mr. Maldutis said.
In October, the carrier agreed to sell its Philadelphia assets to USAir for $67.5 million, taking a loss of more than $30 million on the sale. Midway, which kept the planes it bought from Eastern, began withdrawing from Philadelphia on Jan. 8.
Midway, which employs 5,700 workers, suspended payments on leases for aircraft and loan payments in December and began talks with its lessors and lenders to reduce costs.
"Over the past eight months, Midway and its investment bankers have explored virtually every option available in order to attract additional capital," Mr. Hinson said. The efforts failed, he said, because of the hostile environment facing the industry.
One thing in Midway's favor is that travelers have become accustomed to Chapter 11 filings by airlines. There may be a small loss of bookings in the first few days after a filing, but in other cases bookings have gone back to normal once travel agents and the public realized that the carrier was operating its flights.
Continental Airlines, for example, filed for Chapter 11 protection last December and experienced only a small decline in bookings. Since then, it has been operating normally.
Midway began as a no frills discount carrier in 1979 and grew rapidly, becoming profitable two years later. The established carriers, however, began to respond to its low fares and Midway changed strategy, becoming a high-cost carrier catering to the business traveler.
 
Changing Strategies
 It offered first-class service for the price of coach, which worked at first, but again the carrier was at a disadvantage. It was unable to offer the extensive frequent-flier programs of the majors and did not have the marketing influence that comes from owning extensive reservation systems. It could not offer frequent flights to many cities.
Again in the late 1980's the carrier changed strategy, becoming a niche carrier, which emphasized Midway Airport's advantages -- being close to downtown Chicago and less crowded than O'Hare International Airport.

HEADLINE: Consumer Confidence Shows Big Rebound

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
In the first in-depth survey of consumer sentiment in March, the Conference Board reported yesterday that its index of consumer confidence rose to 81 from 59.4 in February -- a record gain for a single month -- reflecting both relief that the Persian Gulf war had ended and optimism that the economy would improve by late summer.
But the Conference Board, a business organization, warned that the euphoria over the war's end had apparently played such a big role in the upturn that it made the index a temporarily unreliable indicator of whether the recession might be ending. With the war effect gone, confidence could slide in April, said Fabian Linden, the survey's director. 
 "If there had not been a war, I would say, 'Yes, we are coming out of a recession gung ho,' " Mr. Linden said. "But this jump in the index is too big to be explained by saying that people feel all that great about the economy and their jobs."
The survey of 5,000 households, completed in mid-March, asked how people felt about the economy, their job prospects and their incomes -- currently and over the next six months. The answers are tabulated into three indexes: one on future expectations, one on the present situation and an overall index, now at 81, that combines the other two.
The future-expectations index has been the most sensitive in tracking changes in the economy, falling in the early months of past recessions and rising in the final months. Its steep March rise, to 100.4, from 63.6 in February and 55.3 in January, should indicate the end of a recession. But Mr. Linden said he would wait until April to see whether the gain is sustained once war euphoria wears off. The second index, measuring how people felt about their current job situation and income, fell in March to 51.8, from 53.1 in February.
"People still have enormous concern about job security," Mr. Linden said.
When consumer expectations about the future rise -- that is, when consumers say that jobs will probably become more plentiful and incomes will rise -- that optimism often shows up in increased spending. The added buying, in turn, helps to end a recession. The links between confidence and spending are strongest in purchases of homes, cars and appliances, says Paul Samuelson, the Nobel laureate in economic science.
Lately, home sales have risen, but not car and appliance sales.
A second major survey of consumer sentiment, conducted by the University of Michigan's Consumer Research Institute, has not been completed for March -- although a preliminary reading suggested that the Michigan results would be similar to the Conference Board's. But like Mr. Linden, Richard T. Curtin, director of Michigan's survey, said another month's readings were needed to get a fix on the economic outlook.
"People could wake up from their euphoria over the war's end and find that jobs and income are still a problem," he said.
Even with the March surge, the consumer confidence indexes are well below their January 1990 levels, when they began a steady decline. They dropped sharply in August, after Iraq invaded Kuwait. The Bush Administration said the recession, which also apparently began last summer, was a result of the war's impact on consumers.
With the war over, the Administration and many private economists say the recession will end soon -- an optimism that neither Mr. Linden nor Mr. Curtin shares. "The notion that the recent abrupt improvement in confidence will catapult us out of recession is excessively optimistic," Mr. Linden said.

HEADLINE: February Durables Orders Down

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 26

 BODY:
Orders for long-lasting goods like cars and refrigerators weakened in February in an economy that was troubled by recession and war, the Commerce Department said today.
But a report released by the Conference Board in New York showed a strong rebound in consumer confidence this month. 
 The Commerce Department said orders for durable goods were down three-tenths of 1 percent in February -- the third drop in four months -- after a revised decline of 1.5 percent in January.
 
Previous Performances
 Orders had risen 1.4 percent in December after a 10.1 percent plunge in November.
"Our guess is that the recession probably ended in February, and we've now seen the low point," said Lynn Reaser, senior economist with First Interstate Bancorp of Los Angeles. "We've seen it translate only slowly into the auto market, but in the real estate market it's very apparent, so I'd expect a flow-through into durables like household appliances and autos as spring progresses."
Douglas Handler, an economist with the Dun & Bradstreet Corporation, said the durable-goods report suggested that the slide in manufacturing was ending. "With order backlogs no longer shrinking and shipments holding steady," he said,"the likelihood of additional manufacturing-industry layoffs is reduced."
The February decline in orders was smaller than the consenus forecast of economists, which had been for a drop of eight-tenths of 1 percent.
 
Possible Errors Seen
 The department estimated the value of durable-goods orders last month at $118.9 billion but cautioned that data processing errors might have skewed the figure as much as 2 percent too high.
Transportation orders rose one-tenth of 1 percent in February, after falling 5.9 percent in January. The department said higher aircraft orders were offset by lower demand for autos and parts.
Orders for nonmilitary capital goods, an indication of business investment in new equipment, fell 1.7 percent last month after a drop of 9.5 percent in January.
The department revised its estimate for January durable-goods orders to show a 1.5 percent decrease, instead of a 1.8 percent drop.
Shipments of durable goods were unchanged in February, after January's drop of nine-tenths of 1 percent. Unfilled orders, an indicator of future activity, fell one-tenth of 1 percent last month, after being unchanged in January.

HEADLINE: School Tries Longer Classes for Deeper Learning

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOPSFIELD, Mass.

 BODY:
Eight years ago, when Dr. Joseph M. Carroll, the Superintendent of the Masconomet Regional School District, first talked of having 100-minute-long classes in the high school here, teachers scoffed.
"Put students in longer classes and they will learn better," he said. 
 "Leave the curriculum alone," responded teachers and parents from this upper-middle-income school district 30 miles north of Boston. With about 85 percent of the students already going to college, they said, why tamper with a good thing?
But after teachers were asked to assess their own and their students' needs, they decided to give Dr. Carroll's plan a try. The school board agreed, and in the fall of 1989, Dr. Carroll began a school-within-a-school pilot program, the Renaissance Program, at the Masconomet Regional High School.
Eighty students, fully half of the ninth-grade class, volunteered to take two 100-minute "macroclasses." Instead of taking five academic courses, each consisting of a 46-minute class daily, all year long, they take a total of six courses, two each trimester, each consisting of a 100-minute class daily. They join other students for gym and a 46-minute elective period at the end of the day.
 
Good Preliminary Results
 Teachers, meanwhile, with classes of 12 students instead of 25, have time to get to know their students better and offer individualized instruction.
The preliminary results of Dr. Carroll's experiment were good. According to evaluators from the Harvard Graduate School of Education, the grades of students in the Renaissance Program, who for the most part were not high-achieving students to begin with, generally matched or exceeded those of students in the traditional program. Even those students whose grades did not improve were doing more homework and more self-directed projects.
Last fall, despite school budget cuts, Mr. Carroll found $92,000 in private funds to allow those students to continue the program in the 10th grade, as well as to offer it for the incoming ninth grade. One-third of that money was raised by the families of students in the program; the rest came from a foundation. He also stretched the classes to 118 minutes.
Similar extended-period programs have been tried, with success, at the High School in the Community in New Haven, a public magnet school, and at several independent schools. Since January 1990, about 500 educators from more than 35 states and four countries have either come to visit or called Dr. Carroll.
"Changing the schedule is really just a means to an end," said Dr. Carroll, a slow-talking Montana native who wears long, white sideburns and a bolo tie engraved with a buffalo dancer. "The end you are looking for is the change in relationship between the student and teacher."
But such changes often provoke controversy. Partly because of budget concerns and partly because of squabbling about the program's impact, Masconomet's school board voted 9 to 2 last fall to discontinue it after this year, despite widespread praise from teachers, parents and outside evaluators.
"The other structure is so fragmented, so crazy," said David Donavel, an English teacher, about the prospect of returning to the traditional class periods. "It's very, very hard to teach that way."
In the Renaissance Program, he can teach his way. For almost two hours, Mr. Donavel, whom students call "Dave," sits in a circle with the class, listening to his 12 students as they read aloud and discuss their weekly essays, their young voices rising above the rat-tat-tat of the classroom's electric heater.
"For as long as I can remember, I've always wanted to visit the so-called greatest city in the world," read 16-year-old Justin Davis from his essay titled "New York: An Illusion."
But after eulogizing the Statue of Liberty, Justin took a distinct turn in tone.
"During my recent trip to New York I saw that New York is not all glamour and bright lights," he read. "The underground transit system exemplifies the bleakness of the lives of those who are not mentally strong enough or economically rich enough to overcome the barriers of life in New York City."
When he finished, the class exploded with discussion. Some referred to Justin's earlier work. Mr. Donavel directed questions on images, metaphors and style.
"I used to hide way in the back row, but I talk all the time now," said Rebecca Schricker, 15, of Boxford, Mass., after the readings.
Karen Lachmayr, 15, said she liked the depth of discussions. "In other classes," she said, "you just skim over the tops of things. In this class, you have to discuss them."
Teachers, including many at Masconomet, also praise the concept of extended classes, saying it lets them delve into subjects and make thematic connections in a way that is impossible in a 46-minute class.
"In trying to teach about motion in traditional classes, we just give them formulas, show them an experiment and go on," said Charles Hosden, a science teacher. In the Renaissance Program, he said, "We can do the experiment and even change it around."
Although the program is open to anyone who volunteers, and includes some honors students as well as regular students, some parents object that it fragments the school. "To have a sacred cow within the common herd is impossible," said Serena Caperonis, a school board member.
 
Limits on Budget
 Some parents of honors students not in the Renaissance Program say the new program is not so rigorous and therefore honors credits should not be given to any of its participants.
Although no teachers or administrators have been laid off this year, the high school's principal, Stephen Smith, who supports the Renaissance Program, says cuts may come next year. For the last three years, he said, because of the state's fiscal crisis and a refusal by local residents to raise property taxes, the financing of the school district has remained virtually level, at about $7.8 million.
But Dr. Carroll insists that his program has gained enough support so that when the economy improves it should be reconsidered.

HEADLINE: Los Angeles Officers Plead Not Guilty in Beating of Motorist

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, March 26

 BODY:
Four police officers pleaded not guilty today in the beating of a motorist they stopped for speeding, while some of their fellow officers refused to cooperate with a Federal investigation into the incident.
In firm voices, the four officers, dressed in business suits, each answered charges of assault and other offenses, saying, "Not guilty." They face maximum sentences ranging from four years to more than seven in the March 3 beating, which provoked nationwide outrage after an amateur viodetape taken that night showed officers hitting the man more than 50 times. 
 Judge Gary Klausner of the Los Angeles County Superior Court said their trial might start as early as the week of April 28.
In a Federal investigation, agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation broke off interviews with some colleagues of the accused officers after the officers declined to answer the agents' questions voluntarily, a police union representative said.
 
Interviews Terminated
 George Aliano, president of the Los Angeles Police Protective League, said that once an officer said he was giving his statement under duress the F.B.I. terminated the interview. He said about 25 interviews had been terminated in this way.
Cecil Marr, a lawyer for the Los Angeles Police Protective League, said the F.B.I. insisted that the officers' statements be given voluntarily. Scores of officers from the 250-member Foothill Division, where the accused officers worked, were called for questioning, he said.
Fred Reagan, a spokesman for the F.B.I., said the agency's investigation was proceeding, but he declined to confirm whether some of the interviews had been broken off. He said investigators had 21 days to complete their report.
The Justice is investigating the possibility of bringing a civil rights case in connection with the beating. F.B.I. agents have already interviewed the four officers who were indicted as well as witnesses to the incident.
 
'I'm Disappointed'
 A spokesmen for the Los Angeles Police Department declined to comment on the Federal investigation.
Mayor Tom Bradley said he hoped the officers would cooperate. "I have asked for cooperation, the police chief has asked for cooperation and, frankly, I'm disappointed there would be reluctance to do so," he said.
In court today, pleas of not guilty were entered by Sgt. Stacey D. Koon and Officers Laurence M. Powell, Timothy E. Wind and Theodore J. Briseno. All were charged with assault with a deadly weapon -- their feet and police batons -- on Rodney G. King, an unemployed construction worker who was stopped for speeding.
All four were also charged with violating the law that makes it a crime for an officer to assault or beat any person unnecessarily. Sergeant Koon and Officer Powell were also charged with filing false police reports, and Sergeant Koon with being an accessory to a cover-up.
 
Grand Jury Meeting
 A grand jury continued to meet this week as prosecutors presented evidence against other officers among the 27 who were present during the beating.
In all, police spokesmen now say, 21 officers of the Los Angeles Police Department were at the scene as well as four Highway Patrol officers and two from the school district police patrol.
A spokesman for the California Highway Patrol, Sam Haynes, said that his agency had completed an investigation of two of the state officers and that the results were under review.
The four city police officers entered their pleas after the judge refused their lawyers' request for more time to study the 325-page transcript of the grand jury proceedings. They argued that the charges against their clients were not specific enough.
John D. Barnett, the lawyer for Officer Briseno, also argued that repeated showings of the amateur videotape of the beating had put undue pressure on the District Attorney's office to bring quick indictments.
The prosecutor, Deputy District Attorney Terry White, said the evidence had been "thoroughly reviewed and thoroughly presented to the grand jury."

HEADLINE: Cuomo Ties New York City Aid to Union Concessions

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 26

 BODY:
Injecting a new element into New York City's budget problems, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo said today that the state might come forward with a major package of aid for the city, but only if the municipal labor unions agreed to make major concessions to the Dinkins administration.
Mr. Cuomo said that without concessions in the city's labor contracts he would not act to secure deals that could involve hundreds of millions of dollars from the Municipal Assistance Corporation, Battery Park City, the Port Authority and other public authorities in which he plays a major role. On the other hand, he did not guarantee the help if the agreements were reached. 
 "The Mayor is going to come to us for a whole lot of help," Mr. Cuomo said. "There's no conceivable way we could provide that help unless the unions make some contributions first."
The Governor's preconditions on state help represented an unusual intrusion into the authority of Mayor David N. Dinkins over city finances, but they did not seem to be entirely unwelcome. Some people in and out of the Dinkins administration noted that the conditions could help the Mayor not only to gain the concessions, which he has sought over bitter union objections, but also to put at least some of the blame on the Governor for his need to do so.
At the same time, some union leaders said they were angered by the Governor's position and said it would disrupt their negotiations with the Mayor.
 
'No Right to Threaten'
 "The Governor has no right to threaten the people of the city," said Barry Feinstein, president of the teamsters local representing city workers. "What the Governor said today to every New Yorker is that 'I've got money here, but I'm going to hold the city hostage unless the unions give something first.' "
Mr. Cuomo's stance against the city unions comes as he is in the midst of a major battle with the state's public employee unions over a new state spending plan. He has proposed laying off 7,000 state workers and eliminating 11,000 other state jobs.
Some of the larger state workers' unions, in an attack on the Governor that seemed to throw state budget negotiations into even further disarray, said today that they were starting a $1 million television advertising campaign to assail Mr. Cuomo's plan to balance the state budget with severe spending cuts and instead were backing Assembly Speaker Mel Miller's proposal to raise personal income taxes to help close the state's budget deficit.
The proposal by the unions, which have strong support from lawmakers here, in fact goes well beyond Mr. Miller's spending plan by advocating major increases in income, business and sales taxes that would offset many of Mr. Cuomo's planned spending cuts, including the layoffs.
Both Mr. Cuomo and the Republicans who control the State Senate have strongly rejected tax increases in these areas, saying they could devastate the state's economy and drive many businesses out of New York altogether.
 
Need for Sacrifices
 The Governor said his comments on the city budget were consistent with what he has been saying for months, that all sides should be required to make sacrifices for the city to get its financial house in order.
And he took pains to emphasize today that he was not saying the money was available, only that there should be no discussion of it if the unions did not agree to the kinds of concessions Mayor Dinkins called for last week. Among those were a rollback of health insurance costs and other benefits.
But even the possibility of new state money -- which could come in the form of bonds issued by the assistance corporation, or from selling shares in a public authority like the Battery Park City housing corporation -- adds an important dimension to the budget negotiations.
 
'The Fox Hunt'
 On the one hand, it holds out the promise of softening at least some of the severity of the Mayor's task in closing a $3 billion gap in the budget for the coming fiscal year. But it could also add much contention to the budget debate, with unions and others seeking to use the money to offset proposed cuts while business leaders might push for reducing the size of tax increases.
"The fox hunt has now begun," one top Dinkins administration official said.
As Governor, Mr. Cuomo could bring considerable weight to any of several methods that could produce some extra revenue for the state, including arrangements in which public authorities sell off assets or shares, or issue bonds that produce immediate cash and that are paid off over a number of years.
But while there has been discussion about such plans, many of them are complex and can be subject to criticism because they load future obligations onto taxpayers.
One-time sources of revenue like the bond transactions, sometimes described as "one shots," also can be faulted by rating agencies that assess the city's credit because they cannot be counted on in future years and thus raise questions about the city's long-term fiscal health.
For now, city officials say they are not planning on any of these extra sources of revenue to close the budget gap, but Mayor Dinkins has not closed out the possibility, and at a City Hall news conference today he seemed to be laying the groundwork for a justification if they did wind up in the budget.
"One shots are frowned upon or not frowned upon depending to a great degree on how much in relation to a total hole you fill," the Mayor said. "So if we have acceptable methods of meeting our problem," he added, "save for an amount equal to X -- X will not be defined at this point -- then such a one shot might be seen as acceptable, desirable, not even frowned upon by the monitoring and rating agencies that examine us."

GRAPHIC: Chart: "Trying to Soften the Blow"
 
The Public Employees Federation, the second-largest union of state employees, plans to begin broadcasting a series of commercials this week that attack Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's proposed budget and promote higher income taxes and business taxes to offset some of his cuts. Here is one of them.
 
TEXT
 
"Providing vital services for people. That's the heart of New York State. But look what's happening. Doctors and nurses in state hospitals fired. Services for children and youth opportunity tragically cut. Aid for the disabled and elderly slashed. And care for the mentally ill decimated.
 
"New York is in a budget crisis. But wealthy taxpayers and big corporations don't pay their fair share. So, let's stop the firings. End tax cuts for the rich. And keep the heart in New York."
 
BACKGROUND
 
There is wide agreement that the proposed cuts will be among the most severe ever undertaken in state government, but there is also considerable opposition to raising the tax revenues to offset many of these cuts.
 
The unions' budget proposal would raise roughly $3 billion in taxes from the following sources: tax increases averaging $3,000 for taxpayers making more than $100,000; elimination of a series of business tax credits, including the investment credit, and expanding corporations' taxable income to include their out-of-state income, and broadening the sales tax to include services such as lawyers, accountants and computer programmers.
 
The Governor and the Republican-controlled State Senate have rejected many of these tax proposals, arguing that they could drive people and businesses out of the state and produce far less in revenues than the union projects.

HEADLINE: WINE TALK

BYLINE: By Frank J. Prial, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BORDEAUX, France, March 22

 BODY:
When the famous Emile Peynaud put away his test tubes and tasting cup for good two years ago, it was commonly believed that the era of the celebrity enologist was over. No way. In the Medoc, these days, if Michel Rolland hasn't been sniffing your barrels recently, you are definitely out of the loop.
Mr. Rolland, 46 years old, owns Chateau Bon Pasteur in Pomerol and manages Chateau Beauregard, among others. And, consulting as an enologist, he is currently the latest word in wine wisdom. He has ranged as far afield as eastern Long Island and California to dispense his expertise, but it's here in Bordeaux that he is most appreciated. His speciality is the proper use of the Merlot grape, the principal variety in Pomerol wines. Chateau Petrus, the most famous Pomerol, is 100 percent Merlot. 
 In a sense, Mr. Rolland is carrying on Mr. Peynaud's work. The elder wine guru was, and still is, an advocate of rounder, more approachable wines that don't take 30 years to age. And how do you make such wines? One of the most important ways is to add lots of merlot to the blend.
Not that Mr. Rolland can't be second-guessed; he was consulted on the final blend at Chateau Prieure-Lichine but the proprietor, Sacha Lichine, was not satisfied. He asked Patrick Leon, the wine maker at Chateau Mouton-Rothschild and an old friend of his late father, Alexis, to do a little tasting and sniffing.
Mr. Leon suggested a few changes. "I took his advice," Mr. Lichine said with big grin. "I like the blend better, and it gives me 1,000 more cases."
To make the best wine they can, the top chateaus eliminate second-rate batches of wine, especially those made from very young vines. There is constant tension in seeking a balance between quality and quantity. A chateau like Margaux or Latour will cut out 70 percent of a year's production to achieve the highest quality. A good blend and 1,000 extra cases is the sort of combination bound to delight any chateau owner.
 
New Tastings Banned
This year, for the first time, the classified growths in Bordeaux (the top chateaus) banned tastings of the new vintage before this week. In recent years, the owners got fed up with very early reports by wine writers eager to be out with the first pronouncements on the new wine. In certain vintages, the chateaus envisioned some future sales evaporating in the wake of early reports that the vintage was going to be mediocre.
Of course, all news bans are imperfect and the word is that the 90's are quite good, if not in the class of the 89's. Price increases should be minimal. The 1989 vintage was enormous; if the world economy has not picked up by the time the wines are released next year, a lot of Bordeaux wine will want for buyers.
Not that that isn't happening right now. Some chateaus here have actually taken back some of their 1984 wine, an indifferent vintage, from importers in the United States and Britain who see little possibility of selling it.
 
Silver Linings All Over
If there are dark clouds on the horizon, most people here are ignoring them. Construction crews are at work everywhere, their tall cranes visible for miles in the flat vineyard country. Small properties that had fallen into obscurity or disuse are all polished stone, gleaming wrought iron and formal gardens.
At Chateau Pichon-Baron in Pauillac, work continues apace on an enormous new chais -- or winery -- a visitors' center and a museum. Prieure-Lichine, a classic Bordeaux country house and wine chais from the road, has built a circular gift shop, restaurant and heliport behind the 16th century chateau and its more modern but conventional aging cellars.
Much of this prosperity is fueled by France's big insurance companies. By competing with one another to buy wine chateaus, they have increased chateau prices five- and tenfold. Older hands who know Bordeaux's boom-and-bust history are skeptical. They see another generation of corporate executives becoming disenchanted by low-yield wine properties and bringing the current euphoria to an abrubt end.
Meanwhile Bordeaux itself -- the city -- couldn't look more prosperous. New construction is everywhere. The Grand Theatre, designed by Victor Louis (and possibly France's most beautiful theater) is closed for two years of refurbishing, but, for more contemporary tastes, the Grands Hommes center is now open. This remarkable glass-domed amalgam of chic shops, restaurants, food stalls and underground parking garage has taken over the site of the old central market.
Then there is France's newest Virgin Megastore, just opened on the flower-filled Place Gambetta. It's supposed to be a record store, but it offers a restaurant, a hi-fi shop, video rentals, a bookstore and even a wine shop (this is Bordeaux, after all), on six levels connected by three glass elevators in glass tubes.
Not so successful, yet, is the Cite Mondiale du Vin. A project of the powerful C.I.V.B., the French initials for the industry's promotional arm, Interprofessional Committee of the Wines of Bordeaux, the Cite Mondiale is immense and meant to house merchants, importers, wine laboratories, schools for wine professionals and amateurs, restaurants, tasting centers -- just about anything else remotely connected with wine.
It is in the center of the Chartrons, the wine merchants' headquarters in Bordeaux for 500 years. It faces the river Garonne. Most of the old participating companies are gone, but the beautiful facades of their buildings remain. The Cite Mondiale project preserves most of those facades; it is rising behind them.
But the industry shows too little interest and the project is seriously behind schedule. The famous old concerns are not interested in rubbing shoulders with the jug-wine people; even the backwater chateau owners say a tasting in an old, damp cellar is far more romantic than a tasting in a squeaky-clean city laboratory.
Construction is slow. Earlier this month, L'Express published an article on the center called "The Grapes of Indifference."
More successful by far is Vinexpo, the biennial Bordeaux wine fair; it opens here again in June. From modest beginnings eight years ago, Vinexpo has become the most important merchandising and promotional event in the wine world. Wine makers from every country that can raise grapes vie for booth space in the huge Vinexpo tent at Bordeaux Lac, an industrial park just north of the city.
Two years ago, space in and around Bordeaux was so scarce that some exhibitors chartered helicopters to fly their people to and from hotels far out in the countryside. More important than booth space are invitations to the best parties. Heaven help the ambitious young marketer who provides his boss with tickets to Chateau Inconnu's pool party the night of Eric de Rothschild's dinner in the great Ricardo Bofill chais at Lafite.
 
TASTINGS
 
Estancia Cabernet Sauvignon 1987, California, Alexander Valley; about $8.
 Estancia is a separate label of Franciscan Vineyards in the Napa Valley. It is separate because the Estancia wines -- there is also a chardonnay -- come from properties north of the Napa Valley, in the Alexander Valley in Sonoma County. Produced under the supervision of Franciscan's wine maker, Greg Upton, the Estancia wines are consistently good and, possibly because they are so reasonably priced, often underrated. Which is certainly to the consumer's benefit because good wines (and particularly cabernets) selling for under $10 are becoming scarce. This 1987 cabernet is rounded and rather soft, by which I mean it is not at all harsh, as some more tannic wines can be. But it has concentration and plenty of fruit and flavor. It doesn't give the impression of being a wine that will last, but so what? It's a wine to drink and enjoy right now.

Lawrence Welk Encore

 BODY:
Reacting to an avalanche of embarrassing publicity, the House and Senate approved an amendment last week that rescinds a $500,000 grant to develop a museum at the North Dakota birthplace of Lawrence Welk, the polka-playing bandleader. A small victory against Congressional pork-barreling? Don't count the savings yet.
Senator Quentin N. Burdick of North Dakota, the powerful Democrat who inserted the Welk museum grant deep in an agriculture spending bill last fall, also voted to rescind it. However, in a tortured reading of the legislative history, he says the amendment doesn't kill the grant; it merely prevents using the funds to restore the champagne-music maker's home. Mr. Burdick says the money may still be used to turn the site into a German-Russian heritage museum and tourist attraction. 
 The Farmers Home Administration must now decide the issue. But the continuing saga merely affirms the tenacity of Congress, and the need for some fundamental reform. Deciding if a project is pure pork or a legitimate economic development effort deserving Federal funding can be a difficult call. But typically there is no debate. The current budget process permits senior members to quietly insert pet projects in funding bills without real scrutiny by the appropriate committees.
Representative Jim Slattery, the Kansas Democrat who led the fight to rescind the Welk museum grant, now proposes a modest antidote to the usual logrolling: Shed more light on the process by requiring a separate listing of all specially earmarked grants for everyone to see before Congress votes on appropriations.

After Mr. & Mrs. T, Who?

 BODY:
That the financial struggle between Donald Trump and his former wife is over (she got $14 million, the house and the old Mercedes) is presumably a great relief to both. But for at least one onlooker it is little short of a disaster.
Had it not been for Mr. & Mrs. T., this onlooker -- and countless other Americans -- might have drowned in dark thoughts about the economy, unemployed friends, crime and punishment. But Mr. & Mrs. T. were life preservers, in that to contemplate the tribulations of the rich and famous is to be saved for awhile from one's own. 
 Last weekend, however, Mr. & Mrs. T. put their signatures in all the right places, leaving the onlooker to float alone upon a sea of troubles. Who, she wonders, will buoy her now?
Roseanne Barr is usually good for a supermarket headline or two, and Madonna never fails to tease. But times like these demand the really big guns, the biggest of whom is . . .
Elizabeth Taylor, make your move!

HEADLINE: A LOOK AT THE CITY;
Public Duty: Right Here, and Now

BYLINE: By Leslie H. Gelb

 BODY:
New York City is in a war for its future, but does not know how to fight. It has no generals like Powell and Schwarzkopf, no plan and few outside allies. It falls ever deeper into a sinkhole of economic decline, crime, dirt, cynicism and fatalism.
 President Bush struts the world stage, and disdains the home front. Gov. Mario Cuomo excels at lamentations like "there is no money," and confuses rhetoric with action.
 
 Without Washington and Albany providing leadership and money, there can be only one way to fight a war -- with talent and experience.
 New York City needs a government that draws on its impressive array of civic leaders, lawyers and businessmen, many with extensive government experience. Mayor David Dinkins needs to call them to public service, challenge them to give something back to the city that has given them so much and save a city whose creativity, energy and synergy remain unique in our nation.
 Why should Mr. Dinkins do this? He recruited able people, and many should stay with him. But what is required now is not just able people, but the best the city has to offer.
 Mayor Dinkins probably does not think he needs such a drastic revamping of his team to win renomination. He seemingly starts the primary with almost 40 percent (most blacks and many Hispanics) of the total party vote. But if he fails the city, he fails blacks most of all. And if he cannot put the city on the road to recovery, most of his white supporters are likely to abandon him.
 If Mr. Dinkins can attract the most talented into government and turn the city around, he will deserve a second term.
 Why should the city's elite join up? Most of those named below have earned great wealth. Most are Democrats who have no prospects of a Democratic Sir Lancelot carrying them off to Washington and national fame.
 If they genuinely care about public service, they can do their duty right now, right here. If the bright ideas on solving domestic problems they toss around at dinner parties amount to anything, they can implement them right now, right here. Their city needs them no less than the nation.
 Yes, they run risks in working for a Mayor who has a do-little reputation and who might not listen to them. But the alternative for the city's elites is to sit around complaining and giving to charities.
 The challenge will be extraordinary, as will the rewards. They can prove their ability to get things done. They can attract fine young talent back to city government, a place that used to be a proving ground for higher responsibility. It can be so again.
 Who am I talking about? First, Mr. Dinkins needs a top-notch chief of staff. He is not organized and tries to avoid decisions. Someone like Peter Goldmark, President of the Rockefeller Foundation and a former city official, could make City Hall hum. So could David Burke, who held the top staff position for Gov. Hugh Carey.
 For Deputy Mayor for Economic Development or budget director, there are at least three exceptional choices: Peter Solomon, who held the deputy job under Mayor Koch; Roger Altman, formerly an Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, and Robert Rubin of Goldman Sachs.
 Richard Beattie, with Simpson, Thacher & Bartlett, would be a splendid head for Health and Hospitals. Richard Parsons, chairman of the Dime Savings Bank, would do well at Human Resources.
 Winston Lord, who ran the State Department Policy Planning Staff, is a world-class planner. He knows little of city affairs, but learns fast.
 No one knows more about drugs than Mathea Falco, a natural to lead the Mayor's Drug Council.
 Richard Ravitch is the clear choice for Housing Commissioner.
 Percy Sutton could step out of the shadows as an informal Dinkins adviser and become Deputy Mayor for the Disadvantaged. Angelo Falcon, a leader in the Puerto Rican community, deserves a high position also.
 Charlayne Hunter-Gault could take leave from public television and become the Mayor's press secretary.
 And who knows, maybe Henry Kissinger would leap at the post of Commissioner of Ports and Trade.
 Yes, I know this is crazy. Mr. Dinkins won't ask for help. The talented and experienced won't serve. Why bother? The city is a hopeless mess; let someone else fight the war. They can always escape to the tennis courts and to Connecticut and the Hamptons on the weekends.
 But what if the Mayor did ask, and they or others like them said yes?

HEADLINE: The U.N. Squeezes Iraq

 BODY:
The United Nations seems about to crown military success in the Persian Gulf with hard but equitable peace terms. The conditions for a cease-fire set forth in a draft resolution before the Security Council are remarkable in both their sweep and precision. For Iraq, the price for cessation of hostilities is willingness to destroy terror weapons, pay a portion of its oil revenues into a U.N.-administered reparations fund and recognize the inviolability of Kuwait's frontiers.
The council's five permanent members -- the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain, France and China -- are close to final agreement on this landmark resolution. That would clear the way for likely approval by the council as a whole, meaning that Iraq will actually be held accountable for its high crimes against the family of nations. 
 The cease-fire terms would put U.N. observers in a demilitarized zone between Iraq and Kuwait, so that U.S. forces could withdraw to the safer confines of Kuwait and out of a crossfire in Iraq.
If Saddam Hussein rejects U.N. terms, the state of war will continue; so will the presence of foreign forces on Iraqi soil. Punitive economic sanctions would also remain in place, with an exception allowed for "materials and supplies for essential civilian needs." These levers provide real pressure against a tyrannical regime fighting for its life against Kurdish and Shiite insurgents.
Yet if Saddam Hussein accepts the harsh terms, he will be ending a war in which Iraq gained nothing with a peace in which Iraq's military power has been radically reduced, a dire outcome for which he would be personally accountable to the Iraqi people. It is a fittingly bitter dilemma, and his only real choice may be compliance.
The U.N.'s draft terms are deservedly punitive and preventive in calling for the destruction and removal of chemical and biological weapons, plus all ballistic delivery systems -- i.e. Scuds. This would be subject to on-site scrutiny by a special commission. Iraq would also be required to renounce nuclear weapons and place all its weapons-grade nuclear material under international custody for removal.
As compensation to victims of Iraqi aggression, a percentage of Iraq's petroleum revenues would be allotted to a special international fund to meet claims for injuries to people and property, including damage to the environment. The principle is surely just, though it may be some time before a devastated Iraq can make a substantial contribution. Every bit as just is insistence that Baghdad once and for all recognize, as it did in 1963, the sovereign frontiers of Kuwait.
From every vantage, these seem the outlines for a safe and reasonable settlement that is consistent with U.N. resolutions and responsive to security fears of Iraq's neighbors. And by their rigor and breadth, these are terms calculated to discourage other regional bullies with covetous designs on vulnerable smaller states.

HEADLINE: IN THE NATION;
Arming the New Order

BYLINE: By Tom Wicker

 BODY:
Wouldn't it be ironic if the resounding defeat of Iraq, led by the high-tech forces of the U.S., resulted in a third world newly armed to the teeth with smart bombs, ballistic and cruise missiles, helicopter gunships, Patriot-style interceptors and radar-invisible aircraft?
That would make wars between third-world rivals more likely, if one thought it had gained a qualitative advantage over another. Such wars would certainly be more lethal and destructive, and might be more likely to draw in forces from industrialized nations guarding their interests or promoting their weaponry. 
 Even without wars, the increased cost of arms buildups and rivalries among nations that could ill afford such weaponry would divert resources that could better be spent to encourage economic growth and fight endemic poverty.
Yet, just such a third-world race for the latest and best in lethal devices seems in prospect -- encouraged, in all probability, by the Bush Administration's inexplicable decision to aid U.S. military contractors in promoting overseas sales of their hardware.
The war itself, of course, has done the most to stir interest in the acquisition of high-tech weapons. Even the most backward and isolated national leader can hardly be unaware today that Iraq's vaunted army -- said to be the world's fourth-largest -- was quickly blown to pieces by the advanced armaments the U.S. and its allies used so effectively.
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan, for one, drew the obvious lesson. "To undermine the science, technology, research and modern advances in defense is disastrous," he said in a speech in which he emphasized the need to make Pakistan "an impregnable fortress." If Pakistan goes that way, can India be far behind? Or vice versa?
The U.S. Director of Naval Intelligence, Adm. T. A. Brooks, has said that at least 40 nations are seeking radar-evading "stealth" technologies, and that by the end of the century nine more states will join the six that already deploy reconnaissance satellites. Numerous countries now have the ability to build cruise missiles and their guidance systems.
Israel is acquiring submarines from Germany. France does an active arms-export business. China and others have ballistic missile programs, and the Chinese are willing to sell. The Soviet Union, in its need for hard currencies, continues to make available advanced jets and other weapons to third-world countries.
But name-calling does little good, for Uncle Sam himself is one of the world's biggest arms merchants -- peddling $10.8 billion in conventional arms in 1989, second only to Moscow's $11.7 billion. Thus these two accounted for $22.5 billion in such sales out of a world total of $31.8 billion.
Now the Bush Administration has informed Congress that it wants to sell high-tech weapons worth $18 billion -- including F-16's, Patriots, M-1 tanks and multiple rocket launchers -- to five Persian Gulf allies. With such weapons going to Arab nations, Israel's defense worries are bound to increase; and Israel already is one of the largest recipients of the Pentagon's grants and low-interest loans for foreign nations' arms purchases.
The Administration also is siding with arms contractors who have been lobbying for restoration of government authority -- unavailable since the late 1970's -- to underwrite up to $1 billion in arms sales abroad. The proposal, if approved by Congress, would permit the Export-Import Bank to guarantee commercial bank loans made to overseas buyers of U.S.-made arms.
Administration spokesmen insist that there's no conflict with its stated aim of limiting arms sales to the third world. The guarantees, they say, would be available only to the NATO allies, Japan, Israel and Australia, unless -- a very big unless -- the President found it in the national interest to include other nations.
Those spokesmen must be kidding. Only a few years ago, President Reagan found it in the national interest to sell arms to Iran. U.S. weapons sold to legally authorized countries, moreover, often have been resold to unauthorized third parties. Any way you look at it, the Bush proposal would encourage the proliferation of weapons -- including high-tech weapons, perhaps ultimately to third-world nations.
How can that help Mr. Bush build that stable new world order to which he pays such ardent lip service?

HEADLINE: Veterans Deserve Simple Justice on Claims;
Mortgage Game

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Give Them More Than Parades" (editorial, March 9) discusses the steps government and business can take to help returning members of the military from the war in the Persian Gulf adjust to civilian life. One proposed measure is lowering the rate on mortgage loans for these veterans to 6 percent.
The Veterans Administration now guarantees mortgage loans to veterans of 9 percent on a fixed, 30-year loan through approved banks and mortgage companies. The mortgage bankers who offer these V.A.-guaranteed loans add a minimum of 5 percent, known as 5 points, simply for the privilege of borrowing through this program. Any broker in the New York metropolitan area will quote at least this 5 percent figure to a veteran who inquires about the cost of borrowing through this Government-backed scheme, no matter what the linguistic stratagems (such as "origination fees") to disguise the brazenness of charging so many points. 
 Banks in the metropolitan area are charging the public a bit above 9 1/4 percent for a fixed 30-year loan, asking between 1 and 3 points of the would-be home buyer. A veteran participating in the V.A.-sponsored loan is penalized at least 2 up-front percentage points for paying 1/4 percent less on borrowing. Consider also, the veterans loan program has had a minuscule measure of default; further, the lender has virtually no risk of losing his money: the loans are guaranteed through the Federal Government's underwriting.
Now is the time for our leaders in the Government, our senators and representatives, to question this longstanding unconscionable practice of charging a veteran such a huge number of points, well above what is charged in the marketplace to non-V.A. borrowers, for securing a mortgage through a Government-insured program. The lender confronts little risk, yet doubles the points charged to the veteran.
Now is the right time: economists believe that this huge crew of returning veterans, with the right to gain Government-secured mortgages, constitutes a corps of home buyers. Such buying, goes the reasoning of the forecasters, will stimulate the economy and recreate its health after the damage done by the last few months of the recession. Yet veterans should be wary: Why borrow with the new power of a V.A.-guaranteed mortgage if the former serviceman or woman is to be punished by the bankers with the extra points for doing so?

A.T.&T. Adds Fees For New Credit Cards

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
A.T.& T. said yesterday that new applicants for its Universal Card, a combination credit card and a telephone charge card, would receive less generous terms than those who had signed up since the card was introduced a year ago.
As of today, new applicants will be charged an annual fee of $20. In starting the card, A.T.&T. said it would not charge a fee to people who signed up in the first year, as long as the cards were used at least once a year. 
 New customers will not receive the 10 percent discount on long-distance calls that existing card holders receive when charging calls on the Universal Card. And new applicants will pay an interest rate one percentage point higher than the variable rate, currently 18.9 percent, that is charged to the initial customers.
Credit-card industry analysts said the American Telephone and Telegraph Company's move represented a shift in emphasis from gathering new customers to realizing profits.
"I'd say they're giving up," said Joseph E. Wallace, a Chicago consultant. But David F. Robertson, vice president of the Nilson Report, a credit-card newsletter in Santa Monica, Calif., said the move made financial sense.
Paul Kahn, president of A.T.& T.'s Universal Card unit, noted that the company had always intended to charge an annual fee for cardholders who applied after an initial period.
Mr. Kahn said the Universal Card's rates of delinquent payments and bad debts were small fractions of the industry averages and that the company had maintained high levels of customer service while issuing many cards quickly.
A.T.& T. said 5.2 million Universal Card accounts had been opened and 8.5 million cards had been issued.

CORRECTION-DATE: April 2, 1991, Tuesday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article in Business Day on Wednesday about new charges for applicants for the A.T.&T. Universal Card misattributed a comment in some editions. The statement -- that A.T.&T. appeared to be giving up promoting the card -- was made by Joseph E. Wallace, a credit card consultant in Chicago. (David F. Robertson, vice president of the Nilson Report, a credit card newsletter, said the changes made financial sense.)

Money Market Fund Yields Are Mixed for a 4th Week

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields of money market funds monitored by IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report, and reported yesterday, were mixed for the fourth consecutive week.
Analysts at IBC/Donoghue's say that last week's consumer price data for February set the market back somewhat, leaving no sense that the recession is over, but they say most of rate decline has passed. 
 Some sectors in the economy are improving, or may have even stablized, they say, but it will take strong economic data in either direction to persuade the Federal Reserve to move from its current middle-of-the-road policy, they said.
For tax-exempt money funds in the week ended yesterday, the average number of days that securities were held in money managers' portfolios remained unchanged at 50. The assets of such funds declined by $288 million, to a total of $90.8 billion. Analysts say the potential exists for greater cash outflows from the money funds if the stock market, which competes with the funds, continues its strong performance.
The average seven-day compounded yield for the period was 4.44 percent, up by 11 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, while the 30-day compounded average yield rose by 8 basis points, to 4.26 percent.
The taxable equivalent of the current seven-day tax-exempt yield was 6.16 percent for investors in the 28 percent tax bracket, and 6.62 percent for those in the 33 percent bracket.
Of the tax-exempt funds with assets of more than $100 million monitored by IBC/Donoghue's, the Strong Municipal Money Market Fund produced the best return on investments, with a yield of 5.39 percent, or about 95 basis points more than the seven-day compound yield.
The large spread over the week's average yield suggested that the fund might have invested in securities that for some investors were subject to the Federal alternative minimum tax. The fund is managed by Strong/ Corneliuson Capital Management Inc. in Milwaukee.
 
Taxable Assets Down
 The assets of taxable money funds fell by $1.8 billion in the week, for a total of $462.7 billion. Most of the outflow came from institutional assets, which lost $1.5 billion, for a total of $113.3 billion, while consumer assets declined by $300 million, to a total of $349.4 billion.
The average seven-day compounded taxable yield fell by 2 basis points, to 6.22 percent, and the 30-day yield fell by 6 basis points, to 6.31 percent. The fund with the best return on investment in the week was the Dreyfus Worldwide Dollar Money Market Fund, with a yield of 7.19 percent.
By comparison, bank money market accounts, which compete with the money funds and are included in The Bank Rate Monitor's national index, showed that the average rate of return was down by 6 basis points in the week, to 5.53 percent.

HEADLINE: New York City to Cut Garbage Rate for Businesses

BYLINE: By ALLAN R. GOLD

 BODY:
For the first time, New York City will lower the rate that the city's 250,000 businesses pay private haulers to pick up their garbage.
The city is planning to announce today a 7.5 percent cut in the amount that private garbage haulers can charge commercial customers, said Mark Green, Commissioner of the Consumer Affairs Department, which regulates the hauling industry. Mr. Green said the reduction reflects a drop in haulers' costs in recent years, including a decline in the disposal charges that they pay and technological improvements that have saved them money. Beginning May 6, the maximum rate would fall to $13.60 a cubic yard, from $14.70.all figures cq

 New York City businesses pay haulers more than a $1 billion a year, a cost that has long been an irritant. Businesses here pay garbage collection bills that are three times as high as their counterparts in Chicago and Los Angeles, a Consumers Affairs Department survey found. Many businesses also complain that a lack of competition within the industry makes it difficult for them to change haulers or pay less than the maximum rate.
 Under the new rate, Macy's at Herald Square, which spends more than $500,000 a year for garbage collection, could save at least $35,000, the department says. Con Edison's $2.1 million bill could be reduced by more than $140,000. A delicatessen or grocery that pays about $15,000 a year could save more than $1,000.
The city's Sanitation Department, which is responsible for collecting residential garbage, picks up about 17,000 tons a day. Private haulers collect at least 10,000 tons a day.
The lower rate "properly balances the profits the carters deserve under the law with the economic needs of New York City's businesses," Mr. Green said. "At a time when so many other business costs are rising, the city is pleased to help lower one major cost."
 
Haulers to Fight Rate Cut
 Private haulers will go to court to block the decrease, said Salvatore Spinelli, a lawyer for the Council of Trade Waste Associations, a group that represents many of the more than 400 haulers. Mr. Spinelli said the city had miscalculated haulers' expenses and had not given them "due process" in developing the new rate.
But Mr. Green said an analysis of 1989 financial information supplied by the haulers indicated that their costs had fallen in recent years. For example, the department asserts that technological advances had enabled haulers to compress more garbage into a truck, raising the profit of each load.
Haulers have also cut their disposal costs, Mr. Green said. They last received an increase in fall 1988, when the maximum rate rose to $14.70 a cubic yard, from $10.66. They won that rise because the city had raised its charge for dumping garbage at the Fresh Kills landfill on Staten Island. But rather than pay the higher dumping fee, haulers have found less expensive dump sites out of state.
Mr. Spinelli, the haulers' lawyer, said the Consumer Affairs Department had miscalculated in both areas. "The figures are wrong," he said.
Since the $13.60 rate was proposed last November, the haulers have been seeking a new higher rate of more than $19, Mr. Green said. Such a rate is unjustified, he said.

Holders Approve Saatchi Revamping

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, March 27

 BODY:
Shareholders of the Saatchi & Saatchi Company approved the advertising giant's recapitalization plan today, and the company's banks agreed to increase the size and extend the maturity of its credit lines.
Under the plan, preferred shares will be converted to common shares, resulting in the former preferred shareholders owning 78.8 percent of the company. In addition, about 60 million ($105 million) worth of new common shares will be sold. Most of these shares will be offered first to existing shareholders. 
 If existing common shareholders do not buy any of the new shares, the portion of the company they own will be reduced to about 13 percent. If they buy all the shares offered to them, they will own about 20 percent.
 
Two Big Holders
 Two preferred shareholders will end up owning the two biggest stakes in Saatchi. St. James's Place Capital P.L.C., the London-based investment firm controlled by Jacob Rothschild, the British financier, will become the biggest shareholder, with about 12 percent. A group led by ESL Partners II L.P., a Dallas-based investment firm, will own more than 9 percent.
Approval of the plan removes a ticking time bomb: A financially weak Saatchi faced having to pay 211 million ($368 million) in July 1993 to redeem some preferred shares.
Saatchi's 19 banks agreed today to increase credit lines to 320 million ($557 million) from 270 million ($470.5 million) and to extend the maturity of the lines to January 1996 from January 1993. Half of the extra 50 million will be used to replace short-term loans.
Charles T. Scott, Saatchi's finance director, said the recapitalization would enable the company to reduce its net average debt by the end of the year to 185 million ($322 million) from 230 million ($400 million).
 
Share Price Falls
 In London trading today, Saatchi's shares closed at 19.5 pence (34 cents), down 1 pence (1.7 cents). At its peak about four years ago, the stock sold for 6.95, or 695 pence.
At the special meeting, Maurice Saatchi, the company's chairman, said the recapitalization would enable the company to endure the recession in international advertising "and be well positioned to take advantage of the recovery when it comes."
Mr. Saatchi and his brother, Charles, founded the company and built it through acquisitions into what is now the world's second-largest advertising services company, behind the WPP Group. The Saatchi agencies have been grouped into two networks: Backer Spielvogel Bates and Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising.

HEADLINE: Soviet Opposition Defies Ban on Rally

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, March 27

 BODY:
Opposition leaders defied a Kremlin warning today and called on the public to ignore the Soviet Government's ban on staging a rally in the capital Thursday on behalf of Boris N. Yeltsin, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's chief critic and rival.
Rally leaders stressed that marchers should avoid police provocation and stay calm, as they remained intent on rallying the public against an attempt by Gorbachev supporters in the Russian republic's Parliament to oust Mr. Yeltsin as President of the Russian republic. 
 With the police firmly promising to prevent the rally in Manezh Square in the heart of Moscow outside the Kremlin, the city was set for an anxious and uncertain day of political confrontation Thursday as the long-running Gorbachev-Yeltsin rivalry reached a new peak amid the nation's continuing economic and political downward spiral.
 
Rally Tactic: Avoid Provocation
 Muscovites, mindful of Government warnings and sometimes exaggerated reports of police and military preparations, debated whether to challenge the ban. Many clearly were making plans to at least try to march peacefully from two gathering points in the city toward the Kremlin, intending their mere presence in the streets as something of a moral blow against the Kremlin ban.
At the same time, leaders of Democratic Russia, the main opposition umbrella group sponsoring the rally, stressed that marchers should avoid violence and follow the lead of City Council members and other democratic politicians planning to try and stabilize the situation, with peaceful retreat, if necessary, according to some of them.
There was a sense of wariness in the city today, with speculation focused on two well-remembered events.
The first was the memorably large march and rally 13 months ago before which the Kremlin had issued dark-edged warnings of risk and danger, only to tolerate an ebulliently peaceful rally with no incident of confrontation.
 
Lethal Vilnius Confrontation
 The other was the lethal confrontation two months ago in Vilnius, when Soviet tank troops were used on behalf of local Communists against unarmed Lithuanian independence pickets. More than 15 people were killed and President Gorbachev later defended the action as necessary for the sake of maintaining Government order.
Thus, the events of Thursday seemed likely to provide a further reading of just how much more hard-line, or tolerant, the Gorbachev Government is willing to become in trying to deal with political protest.
The city has had two years of experience with street rallies by the nation's fledgling insurgent political opposition, replete with demands for Mr. Gorbachev's resignation, and there have been no instances of street violence.
Large numbers of police and military personnel were in reserve in and near the city, as is usual for all the city's planned and ad hoc politicial events.
 
Gorbachev Sets Urgent Tone
 But there was no advance show of force to be seen today beyond six heavy dump trucks parked at the main entrance to Red Square, which constitute a typical blockade on rally days.
Officials denied reports that armored personnel carriers would be used to block the marchers' way, saying the authorities would rely mainly on their usual measure of large numbers of foot patrolmen and soldiers carrying riot sticks and guiding pedestrians from closed areas.
Mr. Gorbachev set the urgent tone of the confrontation when he called on the Moscow City Council on Monday to ban the Yeltsin demonstration in the name of maintaining public order.
The city government, dominated by insurgents, refused, saying that the rally had been legally approved and that the Kremlin ban was a violation of the public's right of assembly.
 
Exploiting Hard Times
 Mr. Gorbachev, accusing opposition politicians of seeking to exploit the nation's hard times, then ordered the national Interior Ministry to supersede Moscow city officials and take control of the city's law enforcement.
Tass, the Soviet press agency, contended in a commentary today that the public protest rally was nothing less than an attempt to "topple Gorbachev by crowd pressure."
Some of the Democratic Russia officials, in turn, asserted that Mr. Gorbachev's extraordinary measures against the rally were certain evidence of his returning to "totalitarianism."
Members of the Communist opposition have called for Mr. Yeltsin's dismissal for his behavior in criticizing President Gorbachev and demanding his resignation because of the nation's continued political and economic crisis.
The Gorbachev move against the rally came after 29 members of the Russian Parliament complained of feeling intimidated by the public's assembling for political protest.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
'Internal Judgment,' U.S. Says
 WASHINGTON, March 27 (Reuters) -- The United States said today that the order giving the national Interior Ministry control of Moscow's law enforcement was an internal matter.
"Our position on this is that it is an internal judgment of the Soviet Union as to what powers should be held by a given level of government," said the State Department spokeswoman, Margaret D. Tutwiler.

Wind Storms in Kansas Push Wheat Prices Higher

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Wind storms in Kansas evoked visions of crop damage among grain futures traders and sent wheat prices up by a nickel a bushel yesterday on the Chicago Board of Trade.
On other markets, livestock and meats were mostly higher, precious metals declined and energy futures were mostly lower. 
 While the winter wheat damage from the wind and dust storms might prove to be minimal, the market was not taking any chances, said Don Roose, an analyst in Des Moines with U.S. Commodities Inc.
Of more concern is a continuing dry spell throughout the hard red winter wheat belt, although some rain last weekend did help. As of Monday, 52 percent of the crop was rated good to excellent, compared with 26 percent the previous week.
In addition to weather concerns on the futures market, prices were helped by traders who were buying to cover short positions before an important crop report came out today.
Wheat settled 4 cents to 5 cents higher, with the contract for delivery in May at $2.84 3/4 a bushel. Corn was 1/4 cent to 1 cent higher, with May at $2.51 a bushel. Oats were unchanged to 3/4 cent higher, with May at $1.22 1/4 a bushel, and soybeans were 2 1/2 cents to 3 3/4 cents higher, with May at $5.71 1/4 a bushel.
Livestock and meat futures prices advanced on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, responding to a better tone in the economy, said Chuck Levitt, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers in Chicago.
Live cattle settled 0.12 cent to 0.42 cent higher, with the April contract at 81.15 cents a pound. Feeder cattle were 0.08 cent lower to 0.35 cent higher, with March at 89.77 cents a pound. Live hogs were 0.10 cent lower to 0.75 cent higher, with April at 53.20 cents a pound, and frozen pork bellies were 0.32 cent to 0.47 cent higher, with May at 66.42 cents a pound.
Energy futures were mostly lower on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Light sweet crude oil closed 35 cents lower, with the May contract at $19.41 a barrel. Heating oil was 0.18 cent to 0.57 cent lower, with April at 56.61 cents a gallon. The April unleaded gasoline contract, which expires today, was 1.83 cents higher while other deliveries were unchanged to 0.26 cent lower.

Treasury Securities Rise in Price

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
A successful auction of $8.5 billion worth of new five-year notes and rumors that labor market conditions continue to deteriorate helped to push up prices of Treasury securities yesterday, and interest rates fell.
At the auction, the new securities were sold at an average yield of 7.81 percent, a level dealers said was extremely attractive relative to yields elsewhere on the maturity spectrum. 
 "In a relative value sense, this is the highest yield on a five-year security in almost a year," one government securities trader said.
At the last five-year auction, on Feb. 21, the securities were sold at an average yield of 7.51 percent.
The perception that the five-year note yield was attractive was manifested in trading following the auction.
By late in the day, the new five-year securities were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 7.76 percent.
Talk that weekly unemployment claims numbers to be released today will show further increases also helped to spur some buying.
 
March Employment Data
 "The market is beginning to anticipate that the March employment numbers will be weak," another trader said. The employment data are expected to be released by the Labor Department on April 5.
Last week the claims numbers rose to an eight-year high.
Since employment is an indicator that lags behind turns in the economy, "the market is absolutely right" to expect that the March data will be weak, said Nancy Kimelman, chief economist at Thompson Financial Networks in Boston.
Ms. Kimelman added that although there are some signs of life in the economy, "I still think we are in for another two or three months of bad economic statistics."
In addition, the rise in the dollar since the start of the year, an ascent that has accelerated in recent weeks, is causing renewed interest among foreigners in American securities, some analysts said.
"With the enormous strength of the dollar, it is clear we are getting a rebasing of portfolios," said Brian J. Fabbri, chief economist and managing director at Midland Montagu Economics.
 
30-Year Bond Issues
 In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 7 7/8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered late yesterday at a price of 95 7/8, up 18/32, to yield 8.24 percent, down from 8.30 percent late Tuesday.
Among note issues, the 7 3/4 percent 10-year notes were offered at 97 29/ 32, up 11/32, to yield 8.05 percent. And the two-year notes auctioned by the Treasury on Tuesday at an average yield of 7.15 percent were offered on a when-issued basis late yesterday at a price to yield 7.05 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates also fell.
Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 5.76 percent late yesterday, down seven basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates fell by four basis points, to a late offered rate of 5.78 percent. And one-year bills were offered at a discount rate of 5.90 percent, down six basis points.
Activity in the secondary markets for investment-grade corporate bonds and tax-exempt municipal securities remained light.
Corporate bond traders said that prices of most issues rose by 1/8 point to 1/4 point.
Participants in the tax-exempt municipal bond market said that prices of most widely quoted securities inched up by about 1/8 point.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of five-year Treasury notes:

HEADLINE: Many Competing Bills Chase the Energy Problem

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 27

 BODY:
Lawmakers have responded to the Bush Administration's national energy strategy with a flurry of competing proposals to raise gasoline taxes, improve automobile mileage, raise energy efficiency in businesses and homes, open sensitive regions to oil exploration, and spend hundreds of millions of dollars for research on conservation and renewable sources of energy.
At last count, the House Energy and Commerce Committee was reviewing 68 proposals for revamping Federal energy policy, and, in the Senate, four main bills and more than a dozen others have been introduced. 
 Despite the intense energy expended in making proposals, some of the most influential lawmakers have expressed doubts that Congress will resolve fierce regional, economic and environmental issues and reach a consensus on a final package. The reason: Oil supplies are steady and prices have fallen since the end of the Persian Gulf war.
 
No Shortages, No Brownouts
 "At the moment, there are no gasoline lines or brownouts," Representative John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said last month. "I wonder if we are serious enough about energy to solve the problem at long last."
Even if a bill emerges, staff experts in both houses say it is likely to take five or six months to reach the House and Senate floors. The conference to resolve differences between the bills will take more time and, if successful, a final measure may be ready before the election in 1992.
Few members of Congress disagree that there is an energy problem. Low prices discourage domestic oil and gas production, economists say, while also encouraging people to waste energy. The United States is importing nearly half its oil, accounting for half the $108 billion international trade deficit in 1990, according to the Department of Commerce.
Most important, higher imports are vulnerable to costly disruptions of supply. Though the Bush Administration insists the Persian Gulf war was primarily a response to Saddam Hussein's aggression, few in Congress doubt that it was also prompted by oil.
What nobody in Congress knows is whether the public views the Persian Gulf war as a call to action on energy policy or as the price a nation must periodically pay to preserve its oil-based way of life.
"Regrettably, we were not wise enough 10 years ago to continue the energy security measures enacted after the oil crises of the 1970's," said Representative Leon E. Panetta, chairman of the House Budget Committee, who introduced an energy proposal last month that called for establishing a minimum price for oil. "Our dependence has tragically resulted in war. How many times do we have to learn this lesson?"
The debate in Congress will be framed by two issues: whether to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, a 17.9-million-acre wilderness in Alaska, to oil and gas exploration, and whether to raise fuel mileage standards on automobiles by 40 percent.
 
Drilling in the Refuge
 The opening of the refuge was proposed on Feb. 20 by the Bush Administration in its national energy strategy and was included in several Congressional bills, including one introduced by Senators J. Bennett Johnston, Democrat of Louisiana, and Malcolm Wallop, Republican of Wyoming, the chairman and ranking minority member of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.
The President's plan also includes removing obstacles to the constructon of nuclear power plants, reducing restrictions on utilities that generate electricity for the wholesale market and simplifying licensing for hydroelectric power plants, along with a modest conservation effort, including encouraging the use of alternative fuels in vehicle fleets.
The nation's largest environmental groups, among them the Sierra Club and the National Wildlife Federation, have vowed to block any effort to drill in the Arctic refuge. Energy Secretary James D. Watkins promised Senator Johnston in a hearing earlier this month that the President would veto any bill that did not include opening the refuge to oil exploration.
Increasing fuel efficiency in cars was offered by Senators Richard H. Bryan, Democrat of Nevada, and Slade Gorton, Republican of Washington. It calls for raising average fuel economy in cars from 27.5 miles a gallon currently to nearly 40 miles a gallon, an increase that could save 2.8 million barrels of oil daily, about nine times as much oil as the Arctic Refuge is expected to produce daily, Senator Bryan says.
Environmental groups support the bill. But Samuel K. Skinner, the Secretary of Transportation, said on Tuesday that raising fuel mileage standards would destroy the domestic auto industry and he would urge the President to veto any bill that contained such a provision.
Having watched two of the most important groups in the debate stake out their positions, members of Congress and their top staff experts now wonder how much the White House or the environmental community will compromise or whether either the White House or the environmentalists can afford to be accused of derailing a substantive energy bill.
"The question for Congress is, do you lose people by putting both controversial items in a comprehensive bill or do you gain people by tackling the issues and putting both items in," said Jack Riggs, director of the House Energy and Commerce Committee's Subcommittee on Energy and Power. "That's what we're going to spend a year finding out."
Other proposals are attracting considerable attention as well.
Environmental groups are fond of the bill introduced last week by Senators Timothy E. Wirth, Democrat of Colorado, and James M. Jeffords, Republican of Vermont. It seeks to improve the energy efficiency of homes, businesses and the Federal Government but does not mention opening the Arctic Refuge.
In the House, Representative Panetta proposed to control supplies of oil by price strategies. Mr. Panetta's bill would set a price floor of $16 a barrel for domestic oil. It would also raise gasoline taxes.
Under Mr. Panetta's plan, if oil prices increased and then fell back, the Government would be able to collect half of the retreat as an additional tax on gasoline. The Administration has said it opposes any new motor fuel taxes.
Representative Norman F. Lent, Republican of Long Island, the ranking minority member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, has proposed an energy bill with other House Republicans that is similar to the White House energy strategy. It would make it easier for utilities to license nuclear power plants with streamlined procedures. The bill would provide tax credits for utilities that generate electricity with renewable energy sources including the sun, wind, and hot water from deep wells. It also seeks to make it easier for pipeline companies to build interstate natural-gas pipelines.
And Philip R. Sharp, Democrat of Indiana, introduced five proposals that would require the Government to set new fuel-efficiency standards for utilities, expand the Strategic Petroleum Reserve from a billion to 1.5 billion barrels, streamline regulations for building gas pipelines, and provide tax breaks for utilities that generate electricity with renewable sources of energy.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Is Highest in a Year Against Mark in Busy Day

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar reached its highest level in a year against the German mark yesterday as comments from Germany's top economic official strengthened the currency's postwar rally.
Gold was lower. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold fell $1.30 a troy ounce to settle at $356.30. The Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of $355, off $1.50 a troy ounce from Tuesday's late bid. 
 The dollar broke 1.7000 German marks early in New York trading, an important psychological barrier that has not been cleared since last March.
The move came after remarks by the German Finance Minister, Theo Waigel, that his nation could live with the German mark at its current levels. That resulted in an immediate rise in the dollar's value against the mark, as traders rushed to buy dollars before they rose even higher.
By the end of the day the dollar settled at 1.7065 German marks, up from late Tuesday's 1.6870.
The dollar, which was down slightly against the yen in overnight Tokyo trading, rose through the New York session against that currency as well.
"Everytime you turn around it's a little bit higher," said Liliana Nealon, first vice president and currency analyst at Union Bank of Switzerland's New York office.
The upward move defied concerted attempts yesterday by the world's leading central banks, with the apparent exception of the Federal Reserve Board, to drive the dollar lower.
Weaknesses inherent in Germany's economic reunification have become vividly apparent amid reports of increasing joblessness in the former East Germany.
The dollar was also helped by a Commerce Department report that the gross national product fell at an annual rate of 1.6 percent in the fourth quarter, an improvement from an earlier estimate of a 2 percent decline.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 138.40 yen, down 0.10 yen from Tuesday's close. It had gained 1.45 yen in the previous two days. Later in London, it was quoted at 138.50 yen. In New York, the dollar rose to 139.56 yen from late Tuesday's 138.80 yen.
In London, the British pound fell to $1.7405, from $1.7545 late Tuesday. The pound also lost ground in New York, closing at $1.7425, down from $1.7580 late Tuesday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late rates Tuesday, included: 1.4560 Swiss francs, up from 1.4330; 5.7930 French francs, up from 5.7240; 1,269.50 Italian lire, up from 1,253, and 1.1593 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1602.
Silver fell. The metal slipped 6.9 cents a troy ounce to settle at $3.814 on the New York Commodity Exchange. In London, silver fell to a late bid of $3.83 a troy ounce, down from Tuesday's $3.94.

HEADLINE: Surge in Dollar Surprises Some, Worries Others

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The dollar is back from its recent depths, buoyed by allied successes in the Persian Gulf and hopes for an economic rebound at home. The sudden rally has come as a surprise to currency traders, confounded some forecasters and begun to worry Government finance officials because of its potential impact on exports.
In just seven weeks the dollar has leaped 17.9 percent against the German mark and nearly as much against other currencies, ending a 17-month downturn that brought it to historic lows against the mark and the Swiss franc and near record lows against the Japanese yen. 
 After hitting bottom at 1.4475 marks on Feb. 11, the dollar surged on the war news, stirrings of economic life in the United States and hopes for falling interest rates abroad. Yesterday the dollar closed at 1.7065 marks.
"It's incredible, isn't it?" said Liliana Nealon, vice president at Union Bank of Switzerland, noting that the dollar has jumped 3.6 percent just since Friday. "I really think the market is looking back and saying, 'Wow.' "
For the world economy, the dollar rally is a mixed blessing, which is why the response from the United States and its economic partners has been relatively muted so far.
It is an immediate boon for American tourists, who had clearly been suffering from sticker shock on visits to Paris, London, Rome and Berlin, but whose dollars now go further in all those places. It can also ease some inflationary pressure by making imports cheaper.
The stronger dollar and the weaker mark are also welcome news to many Europeans. The shift has enabled countries in the European Monetary System, like France, Spain, and Britain, to lower interest rates to counter slowdowns or recessions. Before the dollar rally, lowering interest rates might have weakened the franc, the peseta and the pound and pushed them out of their fixed trading ranges within the monetary system. But the fall of the mark, the central currency in the system, has widened the room for maneuvering.
For American exporters and manufacturers, however, the stronger dollar could make competition abroad and at home more difficult, as American exports become more expensive and foreign imports cheaper. But for this impact to be felt, the dollar would have to remain at these higher levels for some time.
"I don't think it is a fluke," said Lawrence A. Kudlow, chief economist for Bear, Stearns & Company in New York. "It hasn't run its course, but it is bound to slow down." Mr. Kudlow had been expecting the dollar to strengthen, but the move has been so quick that many other forecasters, like Michael R. Rosenberg, manager of international fixed-income research at Merrill Lynch, have sought to catch the wave by quickly revamping their forecasts that the dollar would stay low.
The rally has brought the dollar back to its levels of a year ago. But at 1.7065 marks to the dollar yesterday, it is still well below the average level of 1.88 in 1988 and the highs of more than 2 marks hit in the late 1980's. And it is still far below its all-time high of 3.475 marks in February 1985.
For American companies with large sales abroad, profits will be hurt when the foreign earnings are converted into dollars. But the reverse will be true for Japanese and, especially, European companies that had been hit hard by a weak dollar.
Some corporations seemed to have been caught unprepared. Mrs. Nealon said she has corporate customers who did not expect the dollar to rise much beyond a brief victory rally after the war. Now they hope to buy dollars when the value dips, only to find that the dollar just keeps rising, forcing them to pay even more.
 
Affecting the Trade Deficit
 A stronger dollar could also slow or even eventually end the decline in the American merchandise trade deficit, which dropped to $100 billion last year. Some economists have advocated an even lower dollar to help reduce this troublesome deficit. But others, like Mr. Kudlow, contend that the deficit can continue to fall, even if a little more slowly, with the dollar at these levels. They say that American manufacturers are more competitive than they were a few years ago and that a modest economic recovery should not create a consumer boom that would cause a surge in imports and a rise in the trade deficit.
The response by officials in the Group of Seven, composed of the United States, Japan, Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada, was a little confusing yesterday but did not indicate strong opposition to having the dollar at present levels.
In Bonn, Theo Waigel, the Finance Minister, said the United States and Germany could live with the current levels of the dollar. His comments, coming on his return from a meeting with Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady on Monday, were taken by traders as clearance to push the dollar higher, and it shot up, passing 1.70 marks and closing at 1.7065, its highest level since March 27, 1990.
In Washington, David C. Mulford, the Under Secretary of the Treasury for international affairs, told reporters: "We are concerned about the rapidity of the rise. We are not seeking a stronger dollar." But he also said that Mr. Waigel's comment was accurate at the time of the meeting with Mr. Baker, which was Monday when the dollar closed in New York at 1.6840 marks.
The dollar's surge started after it hit its low of 1.4475 marks on Feb. 11 in New York trading. At first many traders said the rally would be just a short-lived response to what was shaping up as a quick and easy victory in the war against Iraq. But the rally was pushed further on expectations of a rebound soon from the American recession and a slowing of economies abroad.
Then in early March, the German Government said it would raise taxes to help pay for modernizing eastern Germany. By raising taxes, the Government would have to borrow less, making it suddenly more likely that German interest rates, which set the tone for Europe, would not rise further and even begin to decline.
Foreign exchange traders concluded that interest rates would fall abroad, while remaining stable in the United States or falling only slightly. Such a narrowing of the interest-rate differential between dollars and others currencies makes the dollar more attractive to foreigners.
One immediate effect of the dollar's rise is on the contributions from Germany and Japan to pay for the costs of the war. A report from Bonn yesterday said the German Government agreed to pay more marks to make up for the appreciation of the dollar.
The Japanese have refused so far to cover the loss from the dollar rally. They made their pledge in yen but the United States wants it counted in dollars.

HEADLINE: G.N.P. Rate Down 1.6% In Sign of Milder Slump

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 27

 BODY:
The economy shrank at an annual rate of 1.6 percent in the final three months of 1990, a significantly smaller downturn than previously reported, as spending on the military in the Persian Gulf helped cushion the decline, the Government said today.
The Commerce Department report on the gross national product -- the country's total output of goods and services -- raised hopes that the recession would be short and shallow. 
 Some private economists said the Bush Administration might well be proved correct in its forecast that growth in the G.N.P. would resume in the April-June quarter, but they cautioned that huge leftover debt from the 1980's would dampen a recovery.
 
Optimism From Administration
 The Administration, however, held to its belief that the country was on the verge of a rebound that could rival the peacetime record for growth set in the 1980's.
"We have seen the first tangible signs of a turnaround," Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady told the United States Chamber of Commerce today. He cited a big jump in a consumer confidence index and increases posted for February in housing construction and home sales.
But analysts said any strength would have to come from consumer spending, because export growth, the main bright spot last year, was likely to be held back by economic weakness overseas.
And given the fact that more than a million people have lost their jobs and paychecks since June, analysts said consumer buying would be constrained.
"Consumers can be as confident as they want, but if their financial ability to go out and spend is not there, it won't do anything for the economy," said Paul Getman, an economist with Regional Financial Associates of West Chester, Pa.
Another report today emphasized the strains American companies are operating under. The Commerce Department said corporate profits from current production posted their second straight annual decline, the first two-year drop since 1969-70. Profits were off 3.8 percent last year after falling 7.7 percent in 1989.
The 1.6 percent decline in gross national product in the fourth quarter was an upward revision from previous reports. Two months ago, the decline was put at 2.1 percent; last month, it was put at 2 percent.
The improvement came from export sales, which added $37.7 billion to the economy in the fourth quarter as sales abroad rose sharply and American companies reaped greater profits from their overseas subsidiaries than originally estimated.
Economists said higher military spending related to the Persian Gulf troop buildup added about $5 billion to the G.N.P. in the quarter. .
On the negative side, the Government said consumer spending fell by an even larger amount than first estimated, dropping at an annual rate of $23.2 billion in the fourth quarter.
Data included in the revision of the gross national product for the fourth quarter of 1990 follow, with all dollar amounts in billions at seasonally adjusted annual rates. Percentage changes are from the previous quarter at seasonally adjusted annual rates:

HEADLINE: Small Stocks Surge as Market Levels Off Before Holiday

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
Smaller over-the-counter stocks continued to post strong gains yesterday, but the rest of the stock market leveled off as traders pulled back before the holiday weekend.
Many seemed particularly worried about the Government's report on initial unemployment insurance claims, which is to be released today. 
 A heavy increase in jobless claims could bring a cut in interest rates -- and a big rise in the market. But fewer claims could stall a stock market advance that carried the Dow Jones industrial average yesterday to within 82 points of an all-time high.
The Dow industrials rose 2.72 points yesterday, to 2,917.57. Showing that big stocks were generally weak, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 0.95, to 375.35 while the New York Stock Exchange index slid 0.23, to 205.32.
The Nasdaq composite index, which measures many of the smaller stocks, hit a 52-week high for the second day in a row, rising 3.80, to 482.37, the equivalent of 23 Dow points.
Trading volume on the New York Stock Exchange, though, zoomed to 201.8 million shares, the strongest level in almost two weeks, from 198.7 million shares on Tuesday. Advances only narrowly led declines.
But while only four Big Board stocks dipped to 52-week lows, 146 rose to highs. Drug stocks continued to be prominent among them: Johnson & Johnson soared to a 52-week high of 99 1/2 before ending at 96 3/4, down 7/8. Bristol-Myers Squibb jumped to a high of 80 3/4 before ending at 78 3/8, down 1 1/8. Abbott Laboratories rose to a high of 49 7/8 before ending at 48 1/4, down 1 1/8.
With the economy now expected to bounce back more quickly than expected only a short time ago, airline, railroad and trucking stocks lifted the Dow transportation index 15.16 points, to 1,117.95. Some of the bigger air carriers responded to signs that fare cuts pushed by American Airlines were bringing in business.
American's parent, AMR, rose 1, to 59 1/8, and UAL, the parent of United Airlines, rose 3 1/8, to 146 3/4. Roadway Services, a large trucking concern, rose 2, to 50. And Midway Airlines, which entered bankruptcy proceedings on Tuesday, rose 7/8, to 3 1/2, in heavy trading.
Traders attributed the market's sluggishness to caution about the new jobless claims figures.
Nancy R. Lazar, currently senior vice president and economist of C. J. Lawrence, noted that Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, "followed the number very closely."
"If claims are higher than expected," she said, "odds are the Fed will cut the discount rate."
But Ms. Lazar, who will become executive vice president of the newly formed International Strategy and Investment Group on Monday, said that she expected the number to drop to 480,000 from 519,000 the previous week, and that if she was correct, she did not believe it would prompt the Fed to cut the discount rate.
"But," she added, "my estimate of 480,000 could be too low."
Traders argued that if jobless claims were regarded as exceptionally high, the Fed could trim the rate it charges banks by as much as a half of a percentage point, enough to give the market a hefty push. On the other hand, if the Fed feels that jobless claims are not that serious, it could trim its rate by, say, only a quarter point, which some thought would be disappointing.
With the exchanges closed on Good Friday and the possibility of crucial Fed action, many traders pulled back, taking some profits.
Microsoft, for example, traded as high as 109 1/4 but closed at 107 3/4, ahead 2 5/8, with 1.3 million shares changing hands. Amgen, the hot drug stock, moved as high as 133 1/4 before ending at 132 1/4, up 2 1/4. Apple Computer climbed as high as 70 1/4 before finishing at 69 1/4, down 3/4.
Stocks took off on the opening bell, with the Dow rising 14 points, but they soon began to seesaw. By noon, the Dow was ahead 24 points, but within an hour it slid 26 from where it was. By 2:30, it regained 14 from the low, but dropped 20 from there, bouncing back a bit by the close.
Birinyi Associates, which tracks program trading, said heavy computerized selling cut 11 points off the Dow in nine minutes, starting just before 1 P.M. Program buying cut the loss a point.
In the Square D takeover battle, Square D slumped 1 5/8, to 76 3/4, or below the $78-a-share offer by Groupe Schneider of France. A Federal court in New York denied a motion by Schneider to reject Square D's antitrust claims.
Bandag, a leader in tire retreading, rose 3 1/2, to 96. Bloomberg, a financial information service, said Merrill Lynch had issued a report on the company.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Tokyo Stocks Close Higher
 TOKYO, Thursday, March 29 (Reuters) -- Japanese stock prices moved slightly higher today, rebounding from an early selloff. The Nikkei index of 225 issues gained 102.27 points to close at 26,206.92. On Wednesday, the Nikkei lost 234.73 points.

HEADLINE: Weicker to Accept Cap On Growth in Spending

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, March 27

 BODY:
Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr., taking the unusual step of personally testifying before the legislature, told lawmakers today for the first time that he would accept limits on the future growth of state spending as part of his budget and income-tax plan.
A spending restraint measure, written either into the statute books or into the State Constitution, has been sought by members of both major political parties who worry that tapping the state's wealth with an income tax would lead to an uncontrollable spurt in spending. Connecticut has the highest per-capita income in the nation and is one of only 10 states with no broad-based income tax. 
 Mr. Weicker, who testified for more than 90 minutes today before the General Assembly's Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee, said he understood and welcomed the efforts by individual state representatives and senators to carve the best deal they could out of the budget for their constituents.
 
'Not Going to Happen'
 But he urged them to assert themselves as leaders and not to pay too much attention to what constituents say because he believes a majority of residents will remain opposed to an income tax, however necessary it may be to resolve the state's fiscal and economic crisis and however convincing the arguments.
"At no point are we going to have a majority saying that they want more taxes and less services -- that's not going to happen," Mr. Weicker said.
"But," he continued, referring to the next election year, "a year from now, as the state rebounds with black ink and jobs, those people who lead now will lead in '92. Those who lie in the weeds waiting for mistakes will end up in the prone position in '92."
For Mr. Weicker, Connecticut's first governor elected as an independent in this century and believed to be the first ever to propose an income tax, overcoming the traditional reluctance of Connecticut governors to testify and be grilled at length by lawmakers about budgets and taxes seemed almost an offhand decision: another day, another tradition to be trashed.
Sitting alone before a microphone, he answered questions, dodged others, flattered supporters and warned recalcitrant committee members that there would be "no advantage to be gained by exploiting your state's misery."
 
An Exploratory Tone
 The main tone of the committee's questions was exploratory rather than hostile. Both co-chairmen of the 40-member Democratic-controlled committee -- Senator William A. DiBella, a Democrat from Hartford, and Representative Richard T. Mulready, a Democrat from West Hartford -- have already expressed their support for an income tax.
Many other sympathizers wanted to know how much could be changed in Mr. Weicker's budget without turning him against it -- a line of questioning that the Governor generally sidestepped.
His answers also often seemed contradictory. Without ever mentioning the word veto, he seemed to wave the committee away from changing his plan a great deal. Moments later, he encouraged them to take their best hacks at it.
To one questioner, for example, he said the need for an income tax was dictated by the state's huge deficit and was unavoidable without bringing about great increases in other taxes that would devastate the economy or cuts in spending that would devastate state services. The decision to seek an income tax was so obvious, he said, as to be a "no brainer."
But almost immediately he expressed his own personal dislike of the plan and encouraged the panel to find some other way, though he warned them they would fail.
 
Spending Question Pressed
 Even those committee members, mainly Republicans, who have gone on record as opposed to Mr. Weicker's plan seemed unwilling to challenge him directly. Instead, they mainly pressed the question of the cap on spending. How would Mr. Weicker feel about it being written into the State Constitution? The Governor said he opposed a constitutional measure, but his opposition is largely irrelevant; if an amendment is approved by a three-quarters majority in both chambers of the General Assembly, it goes directly to the voters.
Several Democrats questioned the level of Mr. Weicker's spending cuts and wondered whether some money might be restored without provoking a veto. Mr. Weicker's $7.5 billion spending plan is about $1.2 billion less than a preliminary budget prepared last year under Gov. William A. O'Neill.
 
Chief Tax Mechanism
 Mr. Weicker's plan, presented to the state last month, would lower an array of taxes paid by businesses in an effort to stimulate the economy and simultaneously resolve a $2.4 billion shortfall in tax revenues.
The chief mechanism would be a flat 6 percent tax on all income over $25,000 a year for a family and $12,500 for an individual.
The corporate profits tax, now the highest in the nation at 13.8 percent, would be reduced to 11.5 percent, and the 8 percent sales tax, also the highest statewide rate in the country, would be cut to 4.25 percent but expanded to include new categories like the sale of movie tickets and gasoline.
Existing taxes on income from interest and dividends, which peak at 14 percent for families earning $100,000 or more, and the 7 percent capital-gains tax on income from the sale of stock or other assets would both be eliminated, with all sources of income taxed equally at 6 percent.

HEADLINE: Court Limits Copyright Protection

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 27

 BODY:
In an important copyright decision, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously today that the alphabetical listing of names and addresses in the white pages of a phone directory was not protected by Federal copyright law.
The decision, which overturned a ruling by a Federal appeals court in Denver, has broad potential implications for the computerized information industry and for other publishers of compilations that are essentially factual in nature. 
 While the full scope of the decision will not be clear until courts begin to apply it beyond the context of telephone directories, copyright experts predicted today that the Supreme Court's approach would make it much more difficult to obtain copyright protection for compilations of factual material.
Writing for the Court today, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor said that "copyright rewards originality, not effort," and that "in no event may copyright extend to the facts themselves." In the case of the white pages, she said, alphabetical listings of names and addresses "do not satisfy the minimum constitutional standards for copyright protection" because they are "devoid of even the slightest trace of creativity."
The decision overturned a $6,000 judgment for copyright infringement that a small Kansas telephone company, the Rural Telephone Service Company, won in 1987 against a publisher that incorporated the listings from Rural's telephone book into a competing telephone book that covered a wider area of the state.
While 10 other small telephone companies in the area had sold the publisher, Feist Publications Inc., the right to copy their listings, Rural refused to do so. Feist then copied 1,309 of Rural's listings and included them in its own telephone book. Rural won its copyright infringement suit in both the District Court in Kansas and the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, in Denver.
While the financial stakes were small for the two parties in the case, Feist Publications v. Rural Telephone Service, No. 89-1909, they are likely to prove substantial for other elements of the information industry.
David Lange, a copyright specialist at the Duke University Law School, said the decision might prove "revolutionary for the information industry," with the double-edged result of making information more widely available to the public and at the same time diminishing the economic value of data bases that are essentially compilations of facts.
 
'Sweat of the Brow' Doctrine
 Copyright experts said an important aspect of the ruling was the Court's firm rejection of a basis for copyright protection known as the "sweat of the brow" doctrine. Under this approach, which had been accepted in several appellate circuits, compilations of facts were entitled to copyright protection on the basis of the publisher's effort and investment, not the product's originality.
"Without a doubt, the 'sweat of the brow' doctrine flouted basic copyright principles," Justice O'Connor said. "Rural expended sufficient effort to make the white pages directory useful, but insufficient creativity to make it original."
For phone companies, the impact may not be great. While direct-mail marketers are now free to copy the telephone listings, many will be willing to continue paying for the convenience of obtaining the information on computer disks. Phone companies have typically been willing to sell their listings, as 10 of the 11 Kansas companies did in this case.
 
Selection or Arrangement Cited
 The impact is likely to be felt in other areas of the information industry. Justice O'Connor said that "the vast majority of compilations" would still be entitled to copyright protection as being based on some kind of "original selection or arrangement." But she added that the protection was "limited to the particular selection or arrangement," and not to the facts that were being arranged.
Steven J. Metalitz, general counsel for the Information Industry Association, a trade association of 800 information companies, said the decision raised questions about copyright protection for many data bases. "You'd have to think twice now about making the investment in time and effort" to compile factual material, he added.
Several cases now in the lower courts may soon begin to provide answers to what Mr. Metalitz called the "second generation questions" posed by today's decision. One case, Black's Guide Inc. v. Mediamerica, now before the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, is a copyright dispute between competing publishers of guides to commercial real estate.
Justice Harry A. Blackmun agreed with the outcome of the phone directory case today, but he neither signed Justice O'Connor's opinion nor filed one of his own.

HEADLINE: WASHINGTON TALK;
Lessons of S.& L. Crisis Echo in Talks on Banks

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 27

 BODY:
The time: Shortly before a Presidential election. The voices: Administration officials, asserting that a federally guaranteed deposit-insurance program needs to borrow only a few billion dollars to stay afloat.
The action: Officials huddling with lawmakers to devise a way to borrow and/or rely on industry funds to duck a Federal rescue effort. 
 The election comes and goes. Within days of his inauguration, the new President declares a problem of historic dimensions, a bailout that by later estimates will cost taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars.
That was in 1988 and 1989, and the issue was the savings and loan industry. The question for 1991 and 1992 is whether the banks are offering a replay.
"Everybody is looking at the politics of this and saying it's deja vu all over again," said Karen D. Shaw, a consultant at the Washington-based Institute for Strategy Development, which monitors government action for business.
The variation is that in 1988 the problem was neglected altogether. This time around, while Treasury officials insist that no taxpayers' money will be needed, they are seeking to borrow a whopping $70 billion to bolster an insurance fund that the White House says should post a deficit of only $2.2 billion in 1992. Moreover, they buried the proposal in the fine print of a 317-page bill that they presented as a request for $25 billion in borrowing.
"It's so damned reminiscent of the savings and loan bailout," said Joseph C. Lewis, the House Banking Committee spokesman. "Everyone thinks that something is being camouflaged. In this town, history does no good at all."
Why so much money for a need that the Administration says is minuscule compared to that of the savings and loans?
Regulators insist the reason is to have a reserve -- a kind of "backup plan" that will most likely not be needed, as L. William Seidman, head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, keeps saying.
The other explanation making the rounds is politics. The Administration's private fear is that the condition of the bank insurance fund could drastically worsen, and it wants to avoid returning to Congress with hat in hand until after the 1992 elections.
In this view, no agency asks for less money than it intends to spend. And what elevates the plight of the bank insurance fund to the level of political threat is that at the moment it is, along with the economy, one of the few potential blotches on the Bush re-election effort.
Administration officials have good reason to be concerned. Independent economists, including those at the General Accounting Office, have projected much smaller deficits than has the Administration. All acknowledge that it is easier to predict the Dow Jones average than the future of the bank insurance fund.
Over the past few months, the problems of the insurance fund have snowballed. Mr. Seidman, who initially forecast that the fund would be profitable last year, has revised his predictions downward almost monthly, finally conceding that 1990 was the worst year in the fund's 57-year history. Now he says that 1991 will be even worse, "probably" posting a decline of $5 billion on top of 1990's decrease of $4.8 billion, leaving it with too little cash to handle one large bank collapse.
The Administration seems willing to contort to almost any degree to avoid the appearance of using taxpayers' money. One sign is that it is proposing to borrow much of the money from the Federal Reserve instead of the Treasury. To most economists, including those at the General Accounting Office, that move is little more than window dressing: Federal Reserve money that would normally go to the Treasury to reduce the Federal deficit would instead be lent to the insurance fund.
But Administration officials insist that they have no political motives in mind with their plans to fix the fund, and in particular that they have no interest in sweeping the problems under the rug until after the elections.
"I can promise you, the first time I ever thought about that was right when you asked me the question, right now," Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said in an interview this week. "I mean, among other things, we're going to have an S.& L. debate that's going to go on every half-hour, I guess, so not to worry about if anybody wants to talk about things that are unpleasant."

HEADLINE: All-Natural Bedding: Counting On Sheep, Cotton and Even Milkweed

BYLINE: By EVE M. KAHN

 BODY:
YOUR bed may not be a safe place in which to hide from bad environmental news.
Most of the books at the Terra Verde Trading Company in the SoHo section of Manhattan tell the same sad story: beds can pollute. Polyester sheets are not biodegradable, nor are urethane-foam mattresses, which also emit nasty fumes. And even down offends some environmentalists' sensibilities because of the suffering that plucking inflicts on birds. 
 For alternatives, an increasing number of sleepers are turning to all-natural, cruelty-free bedding, one of the more rarefied corners of the expanding environmental movement. Products range from familiar all-cotton sheets to more exotic pillows packed with buckwheat hulls to fluffy comforters filled with milkweed seed parachutes. Buyers include chemical-sensitive people who cannot abide anything synthetic as well as fans of mother nature's output.
"We take in so much pollution, so many toxins during the day," said David Hormel, a carpenter and woodworker in Santa Rosa, Calif., who sleeps only amid cotton and wool. "It's important to be as healthy as you can while you sleep."
David M. Kingsberg, a Miami businessman, has resorted to all-natural bedding because of allergies. "I've bought, tried and then given away thousands of dollars worth of bedding over the past 10 years because it made me feel like I'd been poisoned," he said. In his tile-floored bedroom, with unpainted wood furniture devoid of glues, he now sleeps on a futon and pillows stuffed with organically grown cotton, wrapped in white all-cotton sheets and blankets.
As for people who do not have such allergies, air-quality researchers have not yet determined whether all-natural bedding is more salubrious than synthetics. "With bedding, we're dealing with a lot of man-made materials that haven't been well tested, that's true," said John Girman, branch chief in the indoor air division of the Environmental Protection Agency. "On the other hand, it's extremely difficult to prove that something's safe; it's much easier to prove that something's dangerous. One thing is certain: being paranoid isn't good for you."
For the moment, the major mattress manufacturers are not feeling much pressure to avoid artificial ingredients. "The consumer wants comfort, support and durability, more than anything else," said Russell Abolt, the executive vice president of the International Sleep Products Association in Alexandria, Va. "Most people don't ask what's in the mattress they're buying. They just want what feels right." Still, mainstream suppliers are not ignoring the all-natural trend.
Next month, at least well-known two makers of bed linens, Fieldcrest Cannon and J. P. Stevens, will introduce unbleached, undyed, untreated cotton products. The solid cream-colored sheets will be available in 180-count and 310-count weights from Fieldcrest Cannon, and 200-count from J. P. Stevens. Prices will be about the same as those for other all-cotton sheets of the same quality.
J. P. Stevens expects retail stores to buy $2.25 million worth of its all-natural bed linens in 1992, said Ana Maria McGinnis, a vice president. She described them as "a very tiny part of the business," but she added, "We're only selling the line to the upper-end outlets."
Anne Bertsch, the director of public relations for the National Bath, Bed and Linen Association in Manhattan, said: "I definitely see a move toward natural fibers. It's surprising because we're such a wash-and-wear country."
There are, of course, many ways to define the word natural. All-cotton sheets and pillowcases have been available for centuries, but in recent years many of them have been treated with formaldehyde, which is used in printing processes and to lock in easy-care finishes.
The E.P.A. considers formaldehyde fumes a "probable human carcinogen," said George Semeniuk, the formaldehyde project manager at the E.P.A.'s Office of Toxic Substances. But a single washing dramatically diminishes the amount of the chemical in fabric, and after that, he said, "there just isn't enough there for the customer to worry about."
The most common non-synthetic casing for futons and mattresses is cotton. Environmentally minded manufacturers scrub the fabric several times to remove pesticide residues: cotton is a heavily sprayed crop, and there is not yet enough organically grown cotton available to persuade fabric mills to weave it.
Natural fillings for mattresses and futons include cotton batting treated with boric acid, a reasonably benign compound used here as a fire retardant; untreated cotton; organically grown untreated cotton; wool, and chemical-free wool.
Buyers pay a premium for the organically grown fillings. An ordinary cotton-filled twin-size futon can be bought for less than $100; one stuffed with organic cotton can cost twice that, and a futon with organic wool stuffing is nearly double the cost of organic cotton.
Although ordinary cotton is inexpensive, its purity varies. "Floor sweepings and even dead birds have turned up in the cheap stuff," said Phillip Abernethy, the inventory manager at Futon Designs in Asheville, N.C.
Because of flammability regulations, untreated cotton is available only by prescription. But many suppliers accept doctors' orders fairly casually. "We'll take them from chiropractors, M.D.'s, naturopaths, whatever," said Valko Sichel, the chief executive of Northwest Futon in Portland, Ore.
Wool stuffing is inherently fire-resistant. Perhaps the country's creme de la natural wool comes from Pure Podunk , a small workshop in Thetford Center, Vt. Its catalogue of mattresses, futons, furniture, toys and household miscellany declares that all its wool comes from "happy sheep raised on small family farms."
Dorian Kinder, an owner of the company, said: "We process the wool with solar power. That doesn't affect the wool at all, but people get a kick out of knowing it."
Since fire-retardancy rules do not apply to pillows, manufacturers can take more liberties with fillings. In addition to cotton and wool, there is kapok (a fluffy white cotton look-alike grown primarily in Asia); millet hulls (millet is a small, round, yellowish seed, a major component in bird food), and buckwheat hulls (confetti-size brown husks, which in pillow form evoke beanbag chairs).
As for natural blankets, all-cotton and all-wool products have been around for centuries, and now there's milkweed. The Ogallala Down Comforter Company in Ogallala, Neb., sells cotton-covered quilts stuffed with 70 percent down and 30 percent milkweed. The company oversees 160 acres of milkweed in southwest and central Nebraska.
"I tried to develop milkweed as an alternative energy source in the 70's," said Herb Knudsen, Ogallala's chief executive. "Milkweed can be processed into synthetic crude oil, but not economically by any stretch of the imagination, so then we started exploring its potential as a down substitute. I'm glad we found a use for it.
"The customer reaction has been kind of skeptical," he added. "It's a tricky crop to harvest, too. If you let it go too long, it can really get away from you -- gone with the wind."

HEADLINE: ESSAY;
Follow the Kurds to Save Iraq

BYLINE: By William Safire

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
President Bush was "sickened" at the sight of a man being clubbed senseless by police while a gang of cops looked on. Yet his stomach is not turned at the spectacle of an American army standing by and watching Saddam Hussein's gunships rain death on the Kurdish people for daring to answer George Bush's call for an uprising.
Having repeatedly incited Iraqis to oust the tyrant in Baghdad; having publicly promised to clear the air of the dictator's deadly choppers -- Mr. Bush suddenly choked up. 
 What is to explain his loss of nerve and sense of moral purpose? The answer is Brer Rabbit's fear of the "tar baby": he does not want to become involved in a genuine uprising of Shiites in the south and Kurds in the north, because that might lead to "instability."
The only outcome Mr. Bush -- and his Saudi and Syrian advisers -- will accept is a military dictator of the Sunni elite not named Saddam. To this inglorious end, we are ready to turn our face away from the wholesale slaughter of innocents, and to abandon the last best hope of the beginning of freedom in Iraq.
Republican Guard troops, who run from foreign armies but enjoy killing their own countrymen, have put down most of the Iran-sponsored Shiite uprising in the south; now their tanks and aircraft will move north to retake Kirkuk from the Kurds. If unhindered by our forces, these thugs will use air cover that General Schwarzkopf admits was "suckered" out of him.
This will make Mr. Bush the third U.S. President to sell out the Kurds. Richard Nixon did it in the 70's, at the behest of the Shah of Iran for regional stability; Ronald Reagan did it in 1988, by rewarding Saddam Hussein with greater commodity credits despite the poison-gassing of 12,000 Kurds in Halabja.
The legendary Kurdish leader Mulla Mustafa Barzani, dying of cancer, was brought to Virginia exile with his young son by the C.I.A. in 1975 after our betrayal. I never met a warrior with fiercer eyes or greater dignity. He repeated with rue the central saying of his 1,000-year-old culture: "The Kurds have no friends." Since that time, I have tried to be one.
Barzani's son Massoud was interviewed this week by American correspondents reaching the Iraqi portion of Kurdistan. Unlike most of the leaders opposed to Saddam Hussein, he is a fighter on the scene, not a voice in exile. He represents his people within Iraq, not the interests of bordering nations, and comes across as a true son of Mulla Mustafa.
His message: The four million Kurds who make up nearly a fourth of Iraq's population do not seek independence now; they will be satisfied with autonomy within an Iraq that respects the rights of disparate groups, religions, ideologies.
That conflicts with the desire of Iran, which wants a Shiite state; with Saudi Arabia, which wants a Sunni military dictatorship; and with Syria, which wants Iraqi anarchy.
But it will no longer upset Turkey, which has begun at last to recognize the ethnic heritage of its own 10 million Kurds. President Ozal wants his nation to be a part of Europe's economy and was undoubtedly moved by the Kurdish human-rights espousal of Danielle Mitterrand, wife of the French President.
Massoud Barzani's goal of a federated Iraq should be America's goal. After World War II, we did not re-install Nazis in Germany or militarists in Japan in the name of "stability." After Desert Storm, we should not demand a Saddam II -- "our" tyrant -- as if Arabs and Kurds were too mentally backward or culturally afflicted to deserve a chance at some form of democracy.
General Schwarzkopf told David Frost he had recommended against Mr. Bush's decision to cut off the ground war at 100 hours, letting Saddam survive in Baghdad; the President disputes this, in the first shot of the campaign of '92. But this much is indisputable: The premature cease-fire, intended to save Iraqi soldiers' lives, threatens to cost hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilian lives.
U.S. troops in Iraq should not be forced to stand idly by as anti-Saddam forces are slaughtered by tanks and gunships. The word Mr. Bush should deliver to Baghdad is "Freeze!" -- no movement of armor, no northward deployment of forces.
We should dispatch a high-level emissary to Massoud Barzani. We should send a message to the Iraqi high command in Baghdad: Depose Saddam Hussein in 48 hours and begin negotiations with the Kurdish rebels -- or else.

HEADLINE: Gorbachev Won't Change the Soviet System

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Stephen F. Cohen ("Gorbachev the Great," Op-Ed, March 11) and Leslie H. Gelb ("Bomblet in Moscow," column, March 13) ignore the ever-increasing democratic forces that challenge the authoritarian center of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. 
 Both of them are wrong in assessing Mr. Gorbachev as a person and as a politician. Mr. Cohen credits Mr. Gorbachev with everything that has happened in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe in the last four years. Doesn't he know that the satellite countries became free because they fought and gained their freedom and not because of Mr. Gorbachev's decision to set them free? His political goal was merely to render the Communist system efficient, while leaving it intact.
Moreover, doesn't Mr. Cohen know that among Moscow intellectuals who in his opinion are wrong were Andrei Sakharov, Aleksandr N. Yakovlev, Eduard Shevardnadze and Gavriil K. Popov, to name but a few, who initially sided with Mr. Gorbachev and whom he excluded from his circle after he altered his course? And what about a sizable interregional group of anti-Gorbachev intellectuals who long for true democracy? And what about numerous journalists who committed themselves to glasnost and are told to return to the ideologically coded language?
Mr. Gorbachev has had no intention to change the system of a state-run economy, party organizations, the Bolshevik empire and, above all, the Communist Party. At this point there are two major issues to be resolved if democracy in the Soviet Union is to take root and flourish:
(1) The political rights of the Soviet nationalities have to be accommodated. Mr. Gorbachev regrettably cannot do it because his only goal is to maintain the political status quo.
(2) The center has to be decentered. It is the major obstacle to genuine restructuring of the Soviet Union. The center will just continue to maintain its autocratic authority and contain all creative forces in the constituent republics.
Why are Americans, including the White House, so scared of the inevitable disintegration of the Soviet empire? Wouldn't it be more advantageous for democracy to have an alliance of free and sovereign states, rather than the politically, militarily and economically antagonistic Soviet Union?

HEADLINE: Gorbachev Won't Change the Soviet System;
Time to Move On

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Prof. Stephen Cohen's Op-Ed piece, "Gorbachev the Great" (March 11), is in many ways a refreshing counterpoint to much of the anti-Gorbachev rhetoric we hear from the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. There can be little doubt that Mikhail S. Gorbachev has had insufficient time to carry out the large-scale reforms to deal with the Soviet Union's economic and political crises. Moreover, perestroika, despite its troubles, is still an important achievement in a bureaucratically ossified society. 
 Given the hardships of Soviet life (it can take a week to find a bottle of milk), it is no surprise that the country's citizens are frustrated and impatient. It is all too easy for Mr. Gorbachev's critics to rally round simplistic democratic slogans. As Professor Cohen points out, genuine reform must be as gradual as it is consensual. There can be no shortcuts to the transformations required to move a planned economy to a market system. Against the complexity of the problem, all crash programs will only jerk the society from one crisis to the next.
Yet, Professor Cohen fails fully to convey the essence of the concern underlying the radical democratic opposition. Behind the calls for Mr. Gorbachev's resignation is the belief that perestroika and glasnost remain efforts to reform, rather than to abandon socialism. The elimination of socialism -- in any form -- is more often than not the real thrust motivating the attacks on President Gorbachev. Fundamental to much of his opposition is the belief that it is no longer possible to reform Soviet socialism. Efforts to do so, it is feared, will only cover deeper social and political structural problems.
Most of those opposing Mr. Gorbachev concede his historic role. But they see him as a man who has played that role, a man who must step down for someone who can lead the country into the next phase of social and democratic transformation. As one Russian recently explained to me, despite his willingness to recognize and confront the failures of socialism, Mr. Gorbachev is not yet ready to give up the socialist cause. Heart and soul, he remains a true son of the Soviet system. His greatest nightmare, as she put it, is that his grandchildren will one day read that their grandfather was the man who destroyed the Soviet Union and with it the dream of the socialist state.
Mr. Gorbachev is arguably state socialism's last best chance. But large numbers of people in the Soviet Union are saying they no longer believe in the socialist project and that after some 70 years they are ready to leave the experiment behind. To overlook this is to slight the deeper political dynamic being played out in both the Soviet Union and its former satellites.

HEADLINE: Abboud Out as Chief At Houston's First City

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, March 27

 BODY:
A. Robert Abboud, the Chicago banker who arrived in Texas three years ago to lead a $1.5 billion bailout of a Houston bank, was ousted today as chairman and chief executive of the First City Bancorporation of Texas in the face of mounting losses and problem loans.
The bailout, which consisted of $970 million in funds from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and $500 million in private capital, began to stumble about a year ago after some foreign loans turned sour and three major borrowers, Circle K, Federated Department Stores and Drexel Burnham Lambert entered bankrutpcy proceedings. Although First City suffered from further deterioration in commercial real estate values in Texas, the bulk of its troubles were out of state.
 
A Second Setback
 The shake-up at First City represents the second time that Mr. Abboud, an aggressive manager, has been asked to leave the helm of a large bank and ends his personal quest to resurrect First City, once Houston's biggest bank. It also dashes his hopes that his successful stewardship of First City would vindicate his bumpy banking career. Mr. Abboud was dismissed in 1980 as chairman and chief executive of the First Chicago Corporation after board members criticized him for losing ground to a rival, Continental Illinois. 
 After Continental failed in 1984, Mr. Abboud maintained that he had prudently led the First National Bank of Chicago, the main subsidiary of First Chicago, and was unfairly forced out.
But at First City under Mr. Abboud, the bank's bad loans threaten to overwhelm it. The bank said today that it expected a first-quarter net loss of between $50 million and $75 million. That loss would come on top of $268.2 million in losses First City incurred in the last half of 1990. In the first quarter a year ago, First City managed to report a $90.1 million profit buoyed only by a pretax gain on the sale of its credit card operation.
 
Federal Review
 The expected loss apparently comes after a Federal regulatory examination of the bank late last year that found some new loan problems. Partly as a result, First City said it expected its nonperforming assets, mainly troubled loans and foreclosed real estate, to climb by between $75 million and $125 million in the first quarter. That would bring its total nonperforming assets to at least $568 million, or about 4.2 percent of assets, or as much as $618 million, or about 4.6 percent of assets.
Faced with the losses, First City also said it was casting about for $200 million in additional capital or may seek a merger or a buyout by a stronger institution. Among the banks that are weighing buying all or part of First City is the First Gibraltar Bank, the largest savings bank in Texas. The Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corporation, the investment banker that stitched together the 1988 bailout, has been hired to find the funds. At the end of 1990, First City's common equity capital, the clearest measure of its cushion to absorb losses, was $349 million, or a unhealthy 2.6 percent of assets. With the expected first-quarter loss, the number would shrink to between $274 million and $299 million.
 
Successor Is Named
 First City said its board, which met in a special meeting today, replaced the 61-year-old Mr. Abboud with C. Ivan Wilson, 63, a longtime First City banker in Corpus Christi, Tex. It was widely assumed by analysts that Mr. Wilson would be a caretaker chairman and chief executive while a search is conducted for a permanent replacement.
Mr. Abboud remains a First City board member.
On the New York Stock Exchange today, First City's shares closed at $4.875, down 12.5 cents.
Analysts said that Mr. Abboud's quest to reassert himself at First City in the image of the powerful, global banker that he aspired to be at First Chicago might have caused him to take on impractical risks for a regional bank that had traditionally been a Texas lender in energy, real estate and consumer loans.
Also, several experts suggested that in his passion to beat out other bidders for the failing bank three years ago, Mr. Abboud did not ask for enough F.D.I.C. money. His investor group got $970 million from the F.D.I.C.'s insurance fund; two other bidders each sought more than a $1 billion in Federal assistance.
That amount of backing, plus the complex structure of the bailout, left First City more vulnerable to sliding values in commercial real estate assets inherited from the old First City. Later bank bailouts in Texas were structured differently and better insulated investors from further losses on loans made by the failed institution.
Mr. Abboud also was too optimistic about the pace of the Texas economic recovery. With few opportunities for loan growth in the still-sluggish economy, Mr. Abboud approved the expansion of the bank's foreign lendings and joined groups of banks that made highly leveraged loans for corporate buyouts and restructurings. All along, he was under pressure to deliver steady growth in loans and profits for the investors who contributed $500 million to the bailout.
 
Too Big for His Bank?
 "First City is, after all, a medium-sized bank, and Abboud wanted to be a major player," said Paul M. Horvitz, professor of banking and finance at the University of Houston. "The losses for the most part were not from doing their knitting in Texas."
The largest blunder was a 1989 loan of $140 million to the Coca family of Spain, which was classified as nonperforming last summer, a year after the loan fees it produced were included in First City's then-healthy profits.
In recent weeks, as the bank's condition worsened and Mr. Abboud ordered 800 jobs pared from First City's work force of 6,400, senior managers also turned against him. They were led by Robert D. Richley, 47, who was recruited by Mr. Abboud as president and chief operating officer.
In today's management change, Mr. Richley retained those posts as well as his directors' seat.
 
Loss for Donaldson
 The messy end to the Abboud management of First City appears likely to cost both him and Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.
The firm lent several million dollars to Mr. Abboud to buy First City stock, which is now valued at one-fourth the purchase price. The F.D.I.C. owned 18 percent of First City's shares in 1988 but sold the block to Donaldson, Lufkin for a profit.
Analysts said Donaldson, Lufkin also holds large amounts of the stock. Catherine Conboy, a spokeswoman at the firm, said today that officials at the firm were unavailable for comment.
In the years between his jobs at First Chicago and First City, Mr. Abboud wrote a book in which he tried to explain his lending philosophy and attempt to clear the record about his stormy departure at First Chicago.
He often cited his book -- "Money in the Bank: How Safe Is It?" -- in interviews upon arriving in Houston. The title of the first chapter is "We're Only Human" and is followed by another chapter he called "Learning the Hard Way."

HEADLINE: Kansas City Journal;
Old Outpost of Slavery Joins Era of Black Mayor

BYLINE: By WILLIAM ROBBINS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KANSAS CITY, Mo., March 27

 BODY:
Residents of this old frontier town, once the western outpost of pro-slavery forces, awoke today with a black Mayor-elect, their first in history. Family legend has it that the Texas shanty in which he grew up was once a slave cabin.
But the election of the Rev. Emanuel Cleaver on Tuesday reveals as much about his city as it does about the man himself, experts here say. And they say it reveals much about his supporters and how the campaign unfolded in a city that has one of the smallest percentages of voters who are black -- 26 percent -- among those that have elected black mayors. 
 Mr. Cleaver and his supporters in the nonpartisan election said today that they were already turning their attention to the city problems he will face when he takes office April 10, succeeding Mayor Richard Berkley.
Mr. Cleaver, a three-term City Councilman who has continued to serve full time as pastor of a United Methodist church, won with 53 percent of the votes cast. He defeated Bob Lewellen, a white City Councilman and businessman, who received 47 percent.
For most experts, the outcome was no surprise, although the only published opinion survey had shown Mr. Cleaver favored by twice as many respondents as Mr. Lewellen. As expected, a large bloc of voters who had said they were undecided swung into the Lewellen column.
The key to the outcome was the candidate himself, said Max Skidmore, a political science professor and dean of the College of Arts and Sciences at the University of Missouri-Kansas City.
"Cleaver managed to suppress the racial element," said Dr. Skidmore. "While holding on to his black support in the predominantly black wards, he was able to attract white support in all areas of the city. His whole career has been spent building bridges between the races."
Just as important, Dr. Skidmore said, "I don't find the sense of racial antagonism here that you find in many other areas."
"It is true that Kansas City has one of the most racially segregated housing patterns," he said, describing one north-south thoroughfare, Troost Avenue, as a sort of Berlin Wall. "But we simply don't have the degree of racial tensions you find elsewhere."
"There is a strong mixture here of Southern and Midwestern roots," he continued. "In this case, I think, the Midwestern prevailed."
Luther Washington, Mr. Cleaver's campaign manager, agreed up to a point. But he said, "This could only happen because of the qualities of the black man who was running."
He added, "What it says about Kansas City is that we still have some blemishes, but we have progressed."
When the vote-counting was over, the 46-year-old Mayor-elect said: "This is not a Cleaver victory. This is a Kansas City victory."
The man who won, others noted, was a far cry from the the young man who arrived here from Texas in 1968 and soon came to be viewed as a radical advocate of civil rights causes. But during his three terms on the City Council, he establised a reputation as a moderate on racial issues who shared many of the goals of local business leaders. For the last four years, he has been Mayor Pro Tem, a sort of vice mayor.
That background served him in good stead in the election. It enabled him to win the support of prominent white business leaders, including James Nutter Sr., a mortgage banker and a skillful fund-raiser who became a campaign chairman.
Mr. Cleaver now inherits the task of trying to solve the city's problems with few powers beyond the force of his personality.
Kansas City's economy benefits from its central location and a concentration of agribusiness interests, and has proved largely resistant to recession. Its downtown is dotted with new office towers as a result of a building boom, but it also has a high vacancy rate. Its population, now about 448,160 people, had been declining but that turned around in the last decade.
The city's most intractable problem, as many business leaders see it, is a school system that is operating under a court-ordered desegregation plan but that has shown little success in regaining substantial numbers of whites who had fled.
As Mayor, Mr. Cleaver is limited by the city's history and charter in his power to deal with such problems. The school district has an independent board. And the city government itself has a mayor-city manager system that reflects efforts more than a half-century ago to curb Thomas Pendergast, the powerful political boss.
The system gives the Mayor one vote on the City Council and the right to name committee chairmen, but little else besides a "bully pulpit." The administration of city agencies is the responsibility of the city manager.
But, Dr. Skidmore noted, the system never prevented Pendergast from controlling public agencies, and he has little doubt that a forceful Mayor can find ways to make his presence felt today.

HEADLINE: Surrealpolitik

BYLINE: By Michael Lind; Michael Lind is executive editor of The National Interest.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The German Finance Minister, Theo Waigel, was here this week to assure the United States that Germany would abide by its financial obligations in the gulf war effort. Last fall, Germany belatedly increased its contribution in response to allied irritation with its military free-riding, and to outrage at the role of its industry in arming Saddam Hussein. Of the more than $11 billion Bonn pledged to the allied effort, the $5.5 billion directed to the U.S. will be paid by the end of this month.
Now that Chancellor Helmut Kohl has fulfilled this minimal commitment, the Administration should make it clear that in future conflicts the new world expects more of the new Germany in the new world order. 
 Pressure to identify German with American foreign policy may be the last thing Mr. Kohl wants. Since January, his popularity has plunged from 71 percent to 34 percent. The Chancellor, who underestimated the costs of unification, has been forced to raise taxes -- taxes that he claims are in part the result of Germany's war contribution. Now the opposition Social Democrats are portraying him as a dupe who is allowing the U.S. to make a profit by accepting promised contributions even though the war cost less than expected.
Mr. Kohl's credibility gap in Germany is his problem. Germany's credibility gap in the world is ours. The war is over, but the millennium has not arrived. A strong and responsible Germany, prepared to undertake military action with its allies in NATO and the Western European Union, is as important as ever, now that Iraq is inflamed by civil war, Yugoslavia is in crisis and the Soviets are cheating on the treaty limiting conventional forces in Europe.
To his credit, Mr. Kohl continues to stress the importance of German participation in NATO. Early in the gulf crisis, however, he did not contest the claim of the left that the West German Constitution prevented him from sending troops.
This claim is doubtful, to say the least. The German Constitution arguably permits the armed forces to participate in collective security actions. The Italians, whose postwar Constitution is far more restrictive, managed to send troops to fight against Iraq. Ironically, in calling for an amendment to permit what many good legal scholars believe is already permitted, Mr. Kohl is giving the Social Democrats a chance to have the Constitution rewritten in a way that will make it more restrictive.
The "political" excuses for German nonparticipation in the war are even less impressive. Some in Germany suggested that sending forces would have raised the ghosts of military adventurism. Nonsense. Nothing could have exorcised phantoms of the Third Reich better than a few German fighters hunting down Scud launchers, to protect Israel from attacks by missiles German business helped to build.
The real reason for Chancellor Kohl's policy has been Germany's fear of the world, not the world's fear of Germany. Polls showed that large majorities of Germans supported the allied effort but wanted Germany to stay out of it. Similar majorities chose Switzerland as the best model for the united Germany. Germany, however, can no more be Greater Switzerland than the U.S. can be Canada writ large. Rather than treating the unrealistic isolationism of today's Germans as a given, Mr. Kohl should have tried to shape opinion during the war by exercising leadership.
For examples of such decisiveness, he need only have looked to past leaders who were willing to risk unpopularity in promoting the interests of Germany and the West. Konrad Adenauer brought Germany into NATO against the wishes of many Germans. Helmut Schmidt sacrificed his prestige in the Social Democratic Party to his resistance of Soviet nuclear blackmail of Europe.
Mr. Kohl himself recently displayed statesmanship of a high order when he seized a passing chance to unite Germany within NATO. The spirit of Kohl present stands rebuked by the ghost of Kohl past. Europe's most important nation could use, if not an Iron Chancellor, at least a chancellor with iron in the soul. It would be unfortunate if an uncertain Germany should find its image in a chancellor of wax.

HEADLINE: Rise in Inflation Cited by I.L.O.

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: GENEVA, March 28

 BODY:
Inflation was higher in 28 industrialized and developing countries in 1990 than it was the year before, according to a survey released today by the International Labor Organization, a Geneva-based agency.
It said that in 19 of these countries, the rate was higher for the second successive year and that 12 reported double- digit inflation. "Inflationary pressures are once again undermining economic stability in many countries," it added. 
 Based on consumer price indexes covering the year ending last December in 46 countries, the study showed a general trend of rising inflation. Only 17 countries reported a lower rate of inflation. They included Germany, France, Ireland, Finland and Canada.
Japan's inflation rate of 3.8 percent was the lowest in Asia, although it was higher than the previous year's 2.6 percent.
In the United States, which showed a higher rate for the second successive year, inflation rose from 4.6 percent, to 6.1 percent.

Dollar Falls Against Mark But Rises in Yen Trading

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar's rally faltered against the mark yesterday, but reached a seven-month high against the yen.
Gold edged up 80 cents an ounce, to $357.10, on the New York Commodity Exchange. The Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of $356 an ounce, up $1 from late Wednesday. 
 The dollar, which hit a 12-month high against the mark on Wednesday, slipped yesterday after news that an angry protest in Moscow did not result in violence. Traders interpreted the relatively calm event as a sign that neighboring Germany's economy might not be adversely affected by restlessness in the Soviet Union.
The yen, traders said, was weakened as Japanese banks bought dollars to replenish year-end reserves to hedge against possible losses in North American investments. Japan's fiscal year ends today.
 
Japan Bank Intervenes
 The dollar peaked in New York at 141.50 yen before settling at 141.23 yen, up sharply from late Wednesday's 139.56 yen. It was the highest intraday level since the dollar hit 142.45 yen on Sept. 6.
The rise came despite two interventions by the Bank of Japan in Tokyo trading earlier. The dollar closed at 139.95 yen in Tokyo, up 1.55 yen from Wednesday's close and its highest level there since Sept. 7. Later, in London, it rose to 141.15 yen.
Leading central banks this past month have tried unsuccessfully to stem the dollar's roughly 20 percent advance since the end of the Persian Gulf war.
In London, the British pound fell to $1.7380, from $1.7405 late Wednesday. Sterling also lost ground in New York, closing at $1.7405, down from $1.7425 late Wednesday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Wednesday, included: 1.7038 German marks, down from 1.7070; 1.4543 Swiss francs, down from 1.4560; 5.7755 French francs, down from 5.7930; 1,268.00 Italian lire, down from 1,269.50, and 1.1579 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1593.
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates Wednesday, included: 1.7055 German marks, unchanged; 1.4550 Swiss francs, up from 1.4530; 5.7820 French francs, up from 5.7790; 1.9222 Dutch guilders, unchanged; 1,269.25 Italian lire, up from 1,268.75, and 1.1585 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1607.
Silver rose. In New York, it was up 3.5 cents an ounce, to $3.849, on the Commodity Exchange.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Postwar Goals Of Turkey's Chief

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

DATELINE: DURHAM, N.C.

 BODY:
PRESIDENT Turgut Ozal of Turkey, a short, rotund man, is an electrical engineer by profession, who describes himself as "logical, rational." Just the eighth president of his country, he is the first who was not a military officer. Interviewed here at Duke University on his swing through Eastern educational institutions, after talks in Washington with President Bush, Mr. Ozal made clear his belief that Turkey, having contributed significantly to the war against Iraq, could play a significant role as a peace maker. And he made no bones of saying that he was seeking economic benefits for Turkey.
Turkey's support of the anti-Iraqi coalition involved substantial costs, which Mr. Ozal conceded were difficult to measure, since they included lost trade with Iraq and Kuwait, lost construction contracts, lost fees for oil from Iraq flowing through the Turkish pipeline and for various goods in transit, lost remittances from Turkish workers in Iraq and Kuwait and the suspension of repayment of Iraqi debts. 
 To be sure, no matter what Turkey had done, many of those costs would have been incurred anyhow. But Turkish sources, including Mr. Ozal's angry critics at home, put the country's losses at $9 billion or more. There is scant likelihood that Turkey will get anything like that sum in cash. Washington is talking about $2 billion to $3 billion.
The Bush Administration wants to do what it can to help the Turks, partly through the donations of other members of the coalition, including Germany, Japan, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Prof. Bruce R. Kuniholm of Duke University said that in return for Ankara's military assistance, American officials had explored the possibility of supplying the Turks with a long list of military items, including tanks, planes, helicopters, missiles and missile destroyers.
Turkey, with the second-largest army in NATO (after the United States), is eager to modernize its forces, now more than ever after the demonstration of Western technological superiority over Iraq.
Mr. Ozal also wants civilian technology and foreign investment, and is hopeful of paying for it by enlarging Turkey's agricultural and textile exports to the West. As Mr. Kuniholm notes in a forthcoming article in Foreign Affairs, President Bush has pledged to review Turkey's textile quotas with a view toward increasing the country's access to the American textile and apparel market. And, most of all, Mr. Ozal wants to get Turkey into the European Community and seeks Mr. Bush's help in persuading the Europeans to let the Turks, their NATO partners, become economic partners as well.
But the Europeans, wary of the large numbers of Turkish workers who want jobs in the West, and of the low Turkish wages, are not eager to open their doors widely either to Turkish goods or Turkish workers, especially with new pressures coming from Eastern Europe. Turkey, already a nation of 57 million, including 10 million to 15 million Kurds, could become the most populous country in Europe by the end of the first quarter of the 21st century.
With its Muslim traditions, Turkey faces East as well as West. Mr. Ozal, fundamentally Western oriented, sees a tremendous opportunity for Turkey to be a bridge between the Middle East and the West and further the peace process. "Wars do not solve problems," he said. "Wars inflict new problems."
He remarked in Durham, "Iraq was stable; now it's unstable, and I don't know how it can be stabilized." He has said publicly that the United States should let the Iraqis decide who will control their government, but this week he said in an interview that the United States could not stand by and allow the Iraqi dictator to exterminate his opposition. Some officials in the Bush Administration expect Mr. Hussein to fall within a few weeks. The Administration, at this point, is determined to avoid assuming the political risks and the enormous economic burdens of trying to govern Iraq, and of organizing and financing its reconstruction.
As a contribution to the peace process, Mr. Ozal stressed the so-called Peace-Water Project, which would include countries from the Persian Gulf to the eastern Mediterranean, including Israel. The Israelis are very short of water, partly because, for domestic political reasons, they are using it so wastefully on cotton production.
High-ranking Turkish officials traveling with Mr. Ozal said they had been meeting regularly with Israeli leaders, sometimes in Ankara, sometimes in Tel Aviv. They said they saw grounds for hope that the Israelis could be brought into wider negotiations over land and water. On the other side, Mr. Ozal said, "As a result of siding with Saddam Hussein, the P.L.O has lost credibility and is not acceptable as a negotiator." He added, "The situation is more complex than anyone thinks."
And more costly, in economic terms, than anyone thinks. Just the American-estimated costs for the reconstruction of Iraq -- "a rubble heap," as a highly placed United States official put it yesterday -- have gone up from $100 billion initially to $250 billion.

HEADLINE: LOOKING OVERSEAS FOR SCHOOL EXAMS

BYLINE: By KAREN DE WITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 28

 BODY:
Reacting to concern about the link between education and the nation's economic competitiveness, a Congressional research group, began looking at examination systems in other countries today and their implications for possible national testing of American students.
"There is going to be some action on a national test this year, whether it's an extension of existing programs or something new," said Gordon M. Ambach, executive director of the Council for Chief State School Officers. Mr. Ambach was one of the participants discussing foreign exam systems at a conference conducted here by the Congressional research group, the Office of Technological Assessment. 
 But opposition to nationwide standardized tests for elementary and high school students remains strong. On Wednesday, two dozen education, civil rights and parents groups denounced the proposals, which have been endorsed by a Presidential advisory panel and a growing number of business leaders.
"Adding more testing is clearly not the way to improve education any more than taking the temperature of a patient more often will reduce his or her fever," said Monty Neill, associate director of the National Center for Fair and Open Testing, a nonprofit group in Boston.
 
'Simple, Stupid and Dangerous'
 Mr. Neill said his group was concerned that President Bush's desire to be the education President and a sense of educational crisis in the nation were encouraging Mr. Bush to do "something simple, stupid and dangerous like a national test."
Other opponents include the National Parent Teacher Association, the American Association of School Administrators, the National Education Association, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
Proposals for national testing have been pushed in recent months by politicians and business groups frustrated with what they term under-prepared workers produced by the American education system.
 
Need Seen for New Standards
 In January, an advisory group recommended to Mr. Bush the creation of a national examination for elementary and high school students.
Education Secretary Lamar Alexander, a member of the panel that recommended tests, said today that national testing was important because "the world has changed, and there are new higher standards for what American children need to know and need to be able to do to live and work in that world."
Also fueling the momentum for national tests are the six education goals agreed upon by the President and the nation's governors last year. Gov. Roy Romer of Colorado, a Democrat who heads a panel responsible for issuing a report on the educational state of the nation next September, has expressed support for some kind of national testing.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Securities a Bit Higher

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities moved slightly higher yesterday in unusually active pre-holiday trading. Dealers and traders said there was also a fair amount of domestic and foreign retail buying, considering that most market participants had closed their books for the quarter and in Japan for their fiscal year as well.
Because today is Good Friday, there will be no markets in corporate or tax-exempt debt issues. The Chicago Treasury bond futures market will also be closed. Although the Treasury, Federal Reserve and many banks will be open, the New York Government securities dealer community will not operate. 
 "Any business in Treasury paper on Friday will be like watching paint dry," said Mark A. McCluskey, chief Treasury securities trader at the New York branch of Bank Julius Baer of Zurich. "Most markets in Europe will also be closed for the Easter Monday holiday as well."
One reason for the positive mood in the Treasury market was the good reception accorded the auctions of $20 billion of two- and five-year notes this week. Another reason was the usual "window dressing" of portfolios with Treasury bills and notes that many investment managers undertake at the end of a quarter.
 
Amount of Business Surprising
 The amount of business was somewhat surprising because many bond traders are reluctant to assume sizable positions unless they can hedge, or lay off, part or all of their exposure in the futures market.
"But it's also true that the front end of the Treasury market looks very cheap to many," Mr. McCluskey said. "That's one reason why this week's auctions of the two- and five-year notes went so well."
The new 7 1/8 percent notes of 1993 were offered late in the day at 100 5/ 32, up 1/32, for a yield of 7.04 percent. At Tuesday's auction, the average yield on the two-year notes was 7.15 percent. The new 7.75 percent notes rose 2/32, to 100 2/32, for a yield of 7.73 percent. This compared with an average yield of 7.81 percent produced at Wednesday's auction of the five-year notes. Both Treasury maturities are now auctioned each month.
 
Claims for Unemployment
 Although the Government reported that the initial claims for unemployment insurance in the week ended March 16 was 510,000, it was somewhat below market expectations and had no effect on the fixed-income market, Mr. McCluskey said. Nor did the increases in personal income and consumption for February reported yesterday.
Among the shortest maturities, discount rates on Treasury bills were little changed on the day. The 90-day bills slipped two basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 5.76 perent; six-month bills dipped a basis point, at 5.79 percent, and the one-year bills lost three basis points, at 5.89 percent.
The Treasury sold $13.5 billion of 15-day cash management bills at an average discount rate of 6.05 percent, and also announced that it would hold its regular auction of one-year bills on Thursday. The size of the auction is $10.75 billion.
Among the longer maturities, the Treasury's 7.75 percent notes of 2001 were unchanged in price and yield at 97 31/32 and 8.05 percent, respectively. The benchmark long bonds, the 7 7/8 percent issue due February 2021, rose 3/32, to 95 31/32, as its yield slipped to 8.23 percent, from 8.24 percent the day before.
For its part, the Federal Reserve added $1.5 billion of reserves to the banking system to accommodate the usual holiday demand for cash. The funds rate that banks charge each other for temporary loans was at 6 1/8 percent when the Fed intervened. The funds then traded down to close at 6 percent, the Fed's perceived target level for this bedrock cost of credit.
Following are the details of the Treasury's auction of 15-day cash management bills:

HEADLINE: SUNY Trustees Vote New Policy On Tuition Rise

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 28

 BODY:
The 400,000 students at the State University of New York would face automatic increases in annual tuition under a broad new tuition policy adopted today by the system's Board of Trustees.
The policy, which must be acted on by the State Legislature and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, would for the first time in the university's 43-year history link tuition rates to a fixed percentage of the system's operating costs. 
 While those increases might eventually be tied to the inflation rate or some other standard figure, they could at first be much larger: student tuition now pays for about 20 percent of the system's costs, but under the policy adopted today it would be allowed to account for as much as one-third.
The board's vote comes against a backdrop of tremendous pressure on SUNY, the largest university system in the nation, and public universities in many other states to cut costs and raise tuition to help solve massive state budget problems.
At the university in particular, administrators are facing state aid cuts of up to 10 percent of the system's $1.5 billion budget in the coming fiscal year, and their complaints of hardship have not always fallen on sympathetic ears here.
A draft of a new audit by State Comptroller Edward V. Regan, for instance, concludes that faculty salaries and other expenses at the state university are significantly higher than at comparable public universities and should be reduced, and it recommends that four of the system's 64 campuses be closed to save money. University officials dispute the findings.
Three months ago the Legislature approved raising annual university tuition by $300, to $1,650, and it is now debating a proposal by Governor Cuomo to increase it by another $500, which if approved would mean that the university's tuition will have risen more than 50 percent in the course of a year.
The University of California system recently voted to raise its tuition rates by 40 percent from $1,850 to about $2,500. The system has nine campuses.
Although any tuition increase is bound to be unpopular, the new policy in New York seemed aimed in part at heading off the bitter student protests and legislative convulsions that inevitably follow any attempts to raise tuition under the present system, in which lawmakers each year have either granted large block increases or kept rates unchanged.
Still, while the board's plan would have the apparent benefit of letting lawmakers off the hook for future tuition increases, its fate is unclear because those same officials may be reluctant to cede the important measure of authority they now have over the system in controlling tuition rates.
The chairman of the state Assembly's Higher Education Committee, Edward C. Sullivan, Democrat from Manhattan, said he was willing to consider a system in which increases were automatically indexed to a specific figure such as the inflation rate, but not one that pegged tuition to rates to whatever size of budget university officials wanted to develop.
The university's chancellor, D. Bruce Johnstone, said after the board meeting here that "moderate, regular" tuition increases would be far preferable to the erratic system now in place. He said the state's budget problems, combined with a seven-year freeze on university tuition before this year, had now "led to an increase being proposed that is much greater than I'd ever like to see happen again."

HEADLINE: I.B.M. Taking Big Charge and Cutting Jobs

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
I.B.M. announced yesterday that it was taking a $2.3 billion charge, which will probably result in a large quarterly loss, to pay for the retirement benefits of current employees. The company also said it will shrink its worldwide work force by 14,000 employees this year.
The International Business Machines Corporation became the first of the nation's leading corporations to comply with a new accounting rule that will require companies to set aside money annually for each employee's eventual retirement benefits, said Diana J. Scott, the project manager for the rule at the Financial Accounting Standards Board, a rule-setting body for the accounting profession. Many other big American companies are also likely to make large provisions, she said. 
 The money set aside -- $2.6 billion -- will result in tax benefits, but they will be only $300 million because of the way I.B.M. handles retirement benefits, said Robert Ripp, the company's treasurer. As a result, the one-time after-tax charge against I.B.M.'s first-quarter earnings will be $2.3 billion.
I.B.M. told analysts last week, who had expected profits of about $1 billion in 1991's first quarter, that its earnings would be as little as half that level, for an indicated quarterly profit of $500 million to $600 million, or 90 cents to $1 a share, from operations. John B. Jones Jr., an analyst at Montgomery Securities, a San Francisco brokerage, said that with the provision for retirement benefits, the company could have a loss of $1.7 billion.
I.B.M. earned $6.02 billion on sales of $69.02 billion last year.
After the morning announcement of the set-aside and job cuts, I.B.M.'s shares rose $1 yesterday, to $113.875, on the New York Stock Exchange.
The nation's biggest computer maker did not take a separate charge for the planned shrinkage of its work force, which amounts to 3.8 percent of the 373,000 people employed at the end of last year. The move coincides with an undisclosed profit on the sale of the company's office equipment division and is intended to produce large savings from reduced labor expenses, said Peter W. Thonis, a company spokesman. That deal closed yesterday, allowing the company to shed the division's 4,000 employees.
No layoffs are planned, Mr. Thonis said, but I.B.M. will try to eliminate 10,000 positions through attrition and by offering early retirement and voluntary resignation incentives. The company's employment peaked at 406,000 in 1986.
 
Focus on Staff Jobs
Incentives will include two weeks' pay for each year of employment at the company or the addition of extra years to an employee's service record for pension purposes. Mr. Thonis said staff positions, primarily in the United States and Europe, are the main targets; factory positions are less likely to be affected.
I.B.M.'s headquarters in Armonk, N.Y., is among the likely targets for the voluntary resignation and early retirement programs, he added.
Mr. Thonis said the work force reduction was part of a long-term plan to shrink the company and was unrelated to last week's comments on earnings.
But Howard M. Anderson, president of the Yankee Group, a consulting firm in Boston, said that the need to shrink the company was closely linked to its faltering results.
Big companies are forcing divisions to share a few, very large mainframe computers, he said, and many companies are running their computer programs on small, less expensive desktop computers instead of investing in a mainframe computer and many terminals.
 
I.B.M.'s Strength
 I.B.M. is far stronger in the mainframe market than in the desktop market. "The economy is responsible for half of their problems, their product mix is responsible for the other half," Mr. Anderson said.
But despite its current troubles, I.B.M. remains wealthy enough to take a one-time accounting charge that many large manufacturers have resisted.
Most companies now pay for retirement benefits as retirees incur them. A few, including I.B.M., have been estimating the benefits that each employee will use and setting aside enough money to pay for those benefits when the employee retires.
Now I.B.M. will set aside part of the money for these benefits each year that an employee works at the company. The $2.6 billion provision is the amount that I.B.M. would have set aside annually since each current employee joined the company.
The new accounting rule was passed by accounting profession panel in December and does not become mandatory until 1993. Mr. Ripp said that the company decided to make an immediate provision because each year of delay would enlarge the amount of money needed.
Miss Scott of the accounting standards board said the rule was needed to help users of company reports, like individual investors and pension fund managers, determine the extent of a company's obligations.

HEADLINE: Journalists Meet And See Gloom On Job Security

BYLINE: By ALEX S. JONES

 BODY:
With many news organizations in the economic doldrums and work force reductions becoming commonplace, there is an undercurrent of worry at the annual convention of the National Association of Hispanic Journalists that began in New York yesterday.
"It's a horrible time to be looking for a job," Gilbert Bailon, metropolitan editor of The Dallas Morning News, told his fellow Hispanic journalists at a session yesterday that focused on the effects of hard times. 
 Despite the perceived paucity of jobs, or perhaps because of it, the usual networking between journalists and recruiters at the Marriott Marquis Hotel at Broadway and 45th Street was under way with special fervor as the association's members made connections that they hoped would lead to new or better jobs.
Though many of the nation's largest news organizations have sent representatives to the convention to scout for likely prospects, there was considerable skepticism that many had jobs to offer.
 
Dismissals a Concern
 And there was widespread concern that a disproportionate number of minority journalists might be dismissed by news organizations if the advertising climate does not improve.
While many newspapers and broadcast stations have aggressively hired minority journalists in recent years to improve newsroom diversity, those most recently hired are often the first to be dismissed because of union restrictions that the least senior employees be the first laid off.
The association, which was formed in 1984, includes Hispanic journalists who work for English-language and Spanish-language publications and broadcast stations.
Jose McMurray, executive director of the association, estimates that more than 3,000 Hispanic people work as journalists in the United States. As the number has increased over the years, the association's meetings have broadened from their original focus of securing more newsroom diversity.
Mr. McMurray said that this year's convention was the first time that management training was offered as part of the program, which he said reflected the advancement and ambition of many of the association's members.
But signs of the soft advertising market were also evident. This year, 81 companies have taken booths at the convention job fair, compared with 92 last year. And overall attendance thus far is down about 20 percent from last year, in part because some companies were not so willing to pay for their Hispanic employees to attend.
The Latino Reporter, the convention newspaper published by Hispanic journalism students, reported in its first issue that the association itself may face budget and staff cutbacks because declining profits at news organizations have meant fewer donations and corporate sponsorships. The companies and their foundations provide much of the financing for the association, as well as for similar associations of black, Asian and Indian journalists.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Bloomberg Is Starting Financial News Service

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
Michael Bloomberg is moving into the financial news business. The audacious former Salomon Brothers trader, whose computer terminals deliver financial data and analysis to a loyal following of securities traders, will be in direct competition with such giants as Reuters Inc., Dow Jones & Company and Knight-Ridder Inc.
"Our mission is to provide everything that issuers of securities, investors and intermediaries need around the globe," Mr. Bloomberg said. "That includes news." 
 Some of the news reports that Mr. Bloomberg currently transmits to his customers come from numerous news agencies, including Dow Jones and The Associated Press, as well as from specialty market and economic research agencies like Moody's Corporate Credit Report.
 
Own Corps of Reporters
 Now, however, Mr. Bloomberg is trying to go beyond transmitting other people's news. He is developing his own corps of reporters to supply the news that might move markets and the background information to help traders guess what might happen next.
Rivals say he may be making an expensive tactical error.
"No one can provide absolute coverage, so there is always a nugget someone new can pick up," said Richard Levine, vice president and editorial director of Dow Jones Information Services. "But that doesn't mean you can do it profitably, because it's people-intensive and you need expensive communications."
Comparisons with other companies that provide financial news electronically can be misleading because many of their reporters are involved in gathering other news as well. But the Bloomberg Business News service is clearly going up against several hefty competitors.
 
200,000 Reuters Customers
 Reuters, the world's largest provider of financial information, with more than 200,000 customers, has 1,300 journalists in 116 bureaus around the world, including photographers and cameramen for its video news group.
Knight-Ridder Financial News has about 200 reporters in 19 bureaus and is especially strong in its coverage of commodities markets. Its business news service also draws on the work of 4,400 reporters at newspapers owned by the Knight-Ridder chain.
Dow Jones's basic business news service, known as the "broad tape," has a staff of 50 in the United States. About 50 more reporters contribute to specialty services like the Capital Markets Report.
The Dow Jones news services also draw on more than 500 domestic reporters for The Wall Street Journal and hundreds more overseas who are employees of foreign editions of the paper or Dow Jones's joint venture with The Associated Press. Dow Jones distributes its news services through its subsidiary, Telerate Inc., and several other data vendors, including Bloomberg. But the company said it would stop using Bloomberg by September, now that the upstart vendor was becoming a news competitor.
Numerous smaller companies make a living in niches in the financial news-gathering business, including Oil Buyers Guide, a Princeton, N.J., company recently acquired by Bloomberg. But the hazards of trying to provide broad coverage were highlighted a little more than a year ago when McGraw-Hill Inc. shut a news service set up at its Standard & Poor's subsidiary to compete with Dow Jones in supplying financial news to brokerage houses.
 
Multimillion-Dollar Investment
 Bloomberg L.P., which is privately owned and backed by Merrill Lynch & Company, which holds a 30 percent stake, has already invested several million dollars in developing its own news service. It has hired more than 50 reporters and has opened news bureaus in New York, Washington, London, Tokyo, Toronto and Princeton, N.J.
Partly to enhance Bloomberg's reputation as a supplier of news, the company has furnished terminals at discount rates to a handful of news organizations, including The New York Times and The Associated Press.
Bloomberg currently charges its customers a basic rate of about $1,000 a month for its terminals.
Interviews with Bloomberg users -- all of them lavish in their praise -- turn up little evidence that news coverage is a large selling point for Bloomberg's terminals. From big banks with scores of terminals to small brokers with one or two, Bloomberg's big attraction remains its core business of supplying prompt, accurate data on securities prices and sophisticated programs for analyzing trends and relationships between different securities.
"If they wanted us to pay for the news service, I would give it some serious thought, but my initial reaction would be 'no,' " said David Poitras, head of bond trading at Wayne Hummer & Company in Chicago.
 
Bloomberg's Only Regret
 Such talk does not faze the 49-year-old Mr. Bloomberg, who said his only regret was not starting his own news service a year earlier.
"Every month has produced a new income and revenue record and that hasn't stopped since we added news, so I have to believe its helping to sell our terminals," said Mr. Bloomberg, who would not disclose specific financial information.
He said nearly 12,000 terminals had been sold and new ones were being added at a rate of about 400 a month.

HEADLINE: Consumer Spending Shows A 0.6% Climb in February

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 28

 BODY:
Consumer spending, depressed for months, rose by six-tenths of 1 percent in February, the Commerce Department said today.
The rise in consumer spending was the biggest since an eight-tenths of 1 percent increase in September, but economists were unimpressed. They said the gain was primarily a reaction to the severe six-tenths of 1 percent spending drop in January. 
 The economists noted that Americans' income growth remained depressed last month, posting a tiny two-tenths of 1 percent gain after having fallen four-tenths of 1 percent in January.
Disposable income -- after-tax income after accounting for inflation -- looked even more lackluster, rising by just one-tenth of 1 percent in February. It had fallen by nine-tenths of 1 percent in January.
Analysts attributed the weak income growth to the rising level of unemployment, which hit a four-year high of 6.5 percent in February. They predicted that it would climb to 6.7 percent or higher in March based on the large increase in unemployment claims so far this month.
The Bush Administration has been predicting that the recession, which pushed overall economic growth down by 1.6 percent in the October-December quarter, will end by midyear. But economists said for the turnaround to occur, the weekly level of unemployment claims will have to start shrinking rather than expanding.
 
Claims for Unemployment
 The Labor Department reported today, however, that the number of new claims for unemployment benefits remained above the half-million mark for a second consecutive week in March, something that had not happened in more than eight years.
The department said 510,000 people filed initial claims for state unemployment insurance in the week ending March 16, after 519,000 claims filed in the previous week.
While the number of new claims can be erratic from week to week, analysts said the high levels suggested that the recession was continuing in March despite other, more favorable reports showing a big jump in consumer confidence and signs of life in the housing industry.
"There is a recovery out there in the not-too-distant future, but it is not in the immediate future," said Bruce Steinberg, an economist with Merrill Lynch in New York. "We still have a few more months of lousy economic numbers to go through."
Unemployment claims are now at the highest level since January and February 1983, a period when the country was just beginning to pull out of the steep 1981-82 recession. Claims hit a weekly high of 676,000 during that downturn, which saw unemployment climb to a post-Depression record of 10.8 percent.
Economists said they believed the unemployment rate in this downturn would not go higher than 7 percent, but they also said a variety of factors would dampen the ensuing recovery, making it much less robust than the typical rebound.
"The critical question now is not whether we will have a recovery, but how robust it will be," said Samuel Kahan, an economist with Fuji Securities in Chicago. "The weak income growth, high consumer debt levels and a lack of pent-up demand will make economic activity relatively anemic."
He said that gross national product growth could well rise in the April-June quarter, as the Administration is forecasting, but he said that economic growth is likely to average only 1 to 2 percent for the rest of the year, far below the 6 percent average that is typical in the first nine months of a new expansion.

HEADLINE: Dynamics Gets Korea Jet Deal

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, March 28

 BODY:
In a surprising reversal of one of the United States' biggest arms deals, the South Korean Government said today that it was dropping the McDonnell Douglas Corporation from a $5 billion program to build fighter planes for its air force, and would award the contract instead to the General Dynamics Corporation, the maker of the F-16.
The sudden change came after months of disputes between South Korea and McDonnell Douglas over costs for the project, which Korean officials said had skyrocketed after they chose McDonnell's F/A-18 fighter more than a year ago. But military analysts here said they also thought the war in the Persian Gulf had had a big effect on the decision, convincing South Korea's Defense Ministry that the less expensive F-16 could match the best Soviet-made equipment flown by North Korea.
 
Price a Big Factor
 The higher price was perhaps the biggest factor in the Koreans' switch to the F-16, said Howard C. Rubel, an analyst at C. J. Lawrence Inc., in New York. The price for the F-16 was listed at $18.4 million a plane, compared with $30.8 million for the F/ A-18, in the Defense Department's 1991 budget, although those prices differ from those paid by the Koreans. 
 The decision is a blow to McDonnell Douglas, which has already said it will lay off thousands of workers because of losses on a new commercial jet project and Pentagon budget cuts. It is a big victory for General Dynamics, which in 1989 was awarded the prime contract for one of the most controversial weapons-and-technology sales of recent times -- Japan's FSX fighter, which is also based on the F-16. [Page D4.]
McDonnell's shares fell by $1.125 today, to $37.50, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. General Dynamics' shares rose by 75 cents, to $33.50, on the Big Board. Both companies are based in St. Louis.
The fate of the Korean fighter program has been closely followed here, especially at a time when South Koreans say they are more confused than ever about the intentions of Kim Il Sung, the aging and increasingly isolated North Korean leader. Seoul is only a few minutes' flight from the demilitarized zone that separates North and South. The type of aircraft chosen to defend the capital is viewed as especially critical.
In announcing the decision tonight, after briefing members of South Korea's Cabinet, the country's Defense Minister, Lee Jong Koo, gave few details about the country's decision. But he suggested that the chief motivation was economic, contending that the price of the McDonnell Douglas project had risen to more than $6.2 billion last year. South Korean news reports, citing military officials, said the entire new project would cost roughly $5.2 billion.
Mr. Lee said the deal with General Dynamics would involve a "significant transfer of technology," something that South Korean industry had insisted upon as it begins to set its sights on the aerospace business. But the details were kept vague.
 
Provisions of Old Pact
 Under the provisions of the old contract with McDonnell Douglas, the company was supposed to provide 12 F/A-18's, built in the United States, to South Korea. An additional 36 were to be built in South Korea out of kits, largely from parts imported from the United States. The remaining 72 planes were to be built in South Korea under McDonnell's guidance, by the Samsung Group, one of Korea's biggest electronics conglomerates. Korean officials said the same mix would be used with the General Dynamics F-16.
It is unclear whether the new deal with General Dynamics will be similarly structured. But in recent months Samsung officials have begun to show some nervousness about the project, chiefly because Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, the giant Japanese company that is heading up the FSX project, has complained that the work yields little profit and enormous political headaches.
The troubles with the McDonnell Douglas deal, South Korean officials have said in recent days, began at around the same time. Soon after the contract was awarded in 1989 the program was estimated to cost about $4.2 billion. But the Korean Defense Ministry added new features to the plane, and the original estimates were based on estimates of inflation that turned out to be incorrect.
In addition, the cost of "localizing" production in South Korea, rather than buying the planes off the shelf, sent the price far higher.
By the end of last year the Defense Ministry began a full reassessment of the program. Once the air war over Iraq and Kuwait broke out in January, Korean officials scrambled to assess the performance of the planes. "The conclusion, I think, was that the F-18 may be more capable against the most advanced North Korean planes, like the MIG-29's," a Western military analyst here said. "But I think they decided either plane could do the job."
McDonnell Douglas's agreement with Korea was not a final contract. A spokesman for McDonnell Douglas, James Reed, called the Government's decision "greatly disappointing" but he added, "While this is a setback, firm U.S. Government approval for current and advanced versions of the F/A-18 insures a bright future for the Hornet well into the 21st century."
 
F-16 a Gulf War Star
 The F-16 Falcon proved its worth as an effective tank killer during the Persian Gulf war, flying night missions to seek out Iraqi formations and discriminating among real tanks, damaged tanks and decoys. Its success helped allied forces to dramatically increase the rate of tank destruction in the days leading up to the Feb. 23 ground offensive.
The carrier-based F/A-18 Hornet, more limited in range and payload than the F-16, was largely relegated to flying combat air patrols to protect the American naval presence.
Moreover, there are considerable economies in operating the F-16. Versions of the same plane are stationed in South Korea by the United States military forces. South Korean pilots are already trained in how to fly the F-16, and military officials said its adoption would make it easier for the two allies to share spare parts.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR;
IRAQ, HITTING HARD, REPORTS BIG GAINS AGAINST THE KURDS

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAIRO, March 28

 BODY:
Iraqi troops loyal to President Saddam Hussein began a major attack today on Kurdish rebels who have occupied a vital oil city in northern Iraq for about a week, diplomats in Cairo said.
Late tonight, the official Iraqi press said Government forces had captured the city, Kirkuk, the most important site in Kurdish hands. Kurdish rebels would not confirm that Kirkuk had fallen, but the Baghdad television showed what it said was footage of an Iraqi official touring the city. 
 Earlier in the day, the Kurdish rebels said they were rushing arms to the city to confront an assault by as many as 150,000 Iraqi soldiers.
 
Food Shortages
 They also said food shortages had become a threat to their revolt, and they appealed to the West and the United Nations to send aid to the region and to let them to use a half-dozen captured airplanes and helicopters to stiffen their resistance against the Iraqis.
As the Iraqis concentrated their firepower on the Kurdish revolt in the north, pro-Iranian Shiite Muslims who have risen up in the south said they had retaken a holy city, Karbala, after losing control of it a week ago to Iraqi loyalists. But the Shiites said Iraqi helicopters were circling and dropping leaflets warning of an attack.
[In Teheran, the spiritual leader of a major Iraqi Shiite opposition group said that Iraqi forces had retaken virtually all the towns in southern Iraq and that Iraqi rebels were now fighting in rural areas. Page A6.]
Karbala has been the focus of intense fighting since the end of the Persian Gulf war, and the Shiite rebellion seemed all but put down more than a week ago, when Iraqi Army troops retook the center and a dozen other southern cities. Even if the Shiites had managed to rise up again in the city, officials in Iran, the United States and Arab countries say they are not strong enough to hold on without outside help.
The dual rebellions in Iraq have strained Mr. Hussein's Government nearly to the breaking point since his army was swept out of Kuwait by allied forces at the end of February. There were expectations that the rebel groups might hold their own against Baghdad's battered military, either overthrowing Mr. Hussein or leaving him so politically weak that his own Sunni Muslim loyalists would chase him from power.
But on Tuesday, the Bush Administration said it had decided to stay out of the rebellions because neither group was strong enough to rule Iraq, and if they succeeded in their regions, the country would be fractured. With both revolts appearing quickly to fizzle, the decision has led to political problems for President Bush at home and to questions among some Arabs about the direction of American policy.
 
Kurds Had Made Gains
 In the last week, Iraqi, Arab and Western officials say, the rebellion in the south all but collapsed, and Iraqi refugees fleeing into allied-occupied parts of the country spoke of Iraqi soldiers sweeping into the southern cities and exacting harsh retribution.
The rebellion in the north has been equally ferocious as Kurds battling to liberate their ancestral homeland moved swiftly to gain control of cities in the mountainous region. On Tuesday, an exiled Iraqi Kurdish leader rode triumphantly into Zakho, a Kurdish border city in Iraq, and spoke of setting up a provisional government.
But today, that leader, Jalal Talabani, pleaded with the West to sustain his uprising. "The food situation is very serious," he said. "We will face starvation if we don't receive food in one month."
Mr. Talabani said he sent messages to the allies asking that they let food into the Kurdish region from Turkey and Iran. Supplies had been embargoed as part of the international pressure on Mr. Hussein, but in the face of a United Nations report describing the country's state as near-apocalyptic, the Security Council decided last week to allow essential supplies into Iraq. The Kurds now say Iraqi troops are blocking the supplies from reaching areas where rebellion is under way.
 
Claims by the Iraqis
 Late today, the official Iraqi press agency said the Baghdad television had shown film of Izzat Ibrahim, deputy chairman of Mr. Hussein's ruling Revolution Command Council, touring Kirkuk. A rebel in Damascus was quoted by Reuters as saying the Kurdish rebels might have abandoned Kirkuk "to avoid more killing of civilians."
"They might leave for strategic places overlooking the city," he said. "The city itself is not of strategic importance."
In Damascus, the National Kurdistan Union said Iraqi troops were preparing to attack Kirkuk by shelling it with long-range artillery and firing on it from helicopter gunships. The union also asserted that Iraq was preparing to bomb the city with fixed-wing airplanes.
Iraq has been denied the use of fixed-wing airplanes under the allied-imposed terms for a cease-fire in the gulf war. If confirmed, the development could increase pressure on Washington to help the rebels, who have appealed to Washington to aid them by restricting Mr. Hussein's freedom to use his armed forces against the uprisings.
For now, that appeal has been turned down, partly to avoid the "Lebanization" of Iraq, partly to keep from embroiling American soldiers in the Iraqi upheavals, and partly out of a wish to abide by international agreements, which gave the allies a mandate to chase Mr. Hussein from Kuwait but did not state that rebels should be armed and organized to drive him from power.
 
'An Internal Matter'
 This view, which has taken hold within the Bush Administration, was echoed today by Prince Khalid Bin Sultan, commander in chief of the Saudi Army. He said the rebellion against Mr. Hussein was "an internal matter" and the business of the Iraqi people, not of the coalition.
These statements, Arab diplomats here say, reflect a fear in Washington and Riyadh that a splintered Iraq could leave pro-Iranian Shiite rebels dominant in the south, giving Iran a major power base on the Iraqi and Kuwaiti borders, and independence-minded Kurds dominant in the north, encouraging other Kurds to rebel against Iran and Turkey.
The Arab diplomats here said that Washington and Riyadh were betting that the severe economic hardships that Iraq now faces would be enough to provoke a coup against President Hussein by the end of the year by army generals. The generals may be more capable of keeping Iraq independent while establishing better ties with its gulf neighbors.

HEADLINE: UTAH POLYGAMISTS ALLOWED TO ADOPT

DATELINE: SALT LAKE CITY, March 28

 BODY:
The Utah Supreme Court has tacitly acknowledged the practice of polygamy as an alternative way of life, entitled to at least some legal protection.
While the Court affirmed the Utah Constitution's ban on polygamy, it ruled Tuesday that a family could not be automatically prohibited from adopting children simply because it is openly polygamist. 
 Justice Christine Durham, writing the 3-to-2 decision, said it was not the role of trial courts to dismiss "without consideration, for example, the adoption petitions of all convicted felons, all persons engaging in fornication or adultery, or other persons engaged in other illegal activities."
Polygamy was widely practiced in Utah from 1847, when Mormon pioneers entered the Salt Lake Valley. Congress sought to halt the practice by imposing political and economic sanctions on the Utah Territory, and in 1890, to gain statehood, the Mormon Church agreed to ban polygamy. Nevertheless, tens of thousands of fundamentalist Mormons in Utah, Arizona, Nevada and California continue the practice.
 
Children of Third Wife
 The ruling was a victory for Vaughn Fischer and his two wives, who are seeking to adopt the six children of Brenda Johanson Thornton. She married Mr. Fischer in 1987, becoming his third wife, but died two months later.
Shortly before she died, Mrs. Thornton signed over custody of her children to Mr. Fischer, with their father's consent. But Mrs. Thornton's father and two sisters, Pat and Janet Johanson, are also seeking to adopt the children and went to court to challenge the right of a polygamous family to adopt.
The Johanson sisters were once active fundamentalists but now say polygamy is immoral and essentially sexually abusive. They also said Mrs. Thornton was coerced by fundamentalist leaders into marrying Mr. Fischer.
A lower court sided with the Johansons, ruling that "the practice of polygamy constitutes immoral conduct," and that it would not be "in the best interests of the children to be raised in such an atmosphere."
The Fischers appealed to the state Supreme Court, which ruled that they could proceed with an adoption hearing.
 
Rights of 'Normal Citizens'
 Sharane Fischer, one of Mr. Fischer's wives, said the decision is "one more step forward in obtaining rights that normal citizens have, that every citizen should have," adding, "We feel we should have the right to adopt our own children."
Mr. Fischer called the court decision the fulfillment of God's will. "Of course we believe this is in the Lord's hands, but this very well could be the beginning of things being righted," he said.
The decision does not award adoption to the Fischers but sends the case back to district court, where the Fischers' overall qualifications as parents will be put on trial.
A state social worker visited the family's home in 1987 after the adoption application was filed and found the Fischers "highly qualified" to adopt the children.
Tim Anderson, a lawyer for the Johansons, said: "Obviously the effects of polygamy relative to the adoption of children, and the state allowing the inappropriate placement of children into that environment, will be addressed at that time. Polygamy in Utah will be put on trial."
 
Civil Rights Issue?
 But polygamy is not the issue, said David Nuffer, a lawyer for the Fischers. "It's a decision that speaks of freedom," he said. "It means people who practice plural marriage still have civil rights."
While the case proceeds, the children, who are age 8 to 21 years, will continue to live with the Fischers in the tiny town of Hildale in south Utah, as they have done since their mother died.
"The children are happy about the decision," Sharane Fischer said. "The children have been with us all the time, so it has been life as usual."

HEADLINE: Newark's Unsung Delights

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS

 BODY:
It happens every time. You let people know that there is a sprawling, historic, undiscovered city only half an hour from midtown Manhattan. You explain that they'll be able to explore celebrated inexpensive restaurants, neighborhood exotica, a world-class museum and engage in a bit of sightseeing.
You find that there is considerable interest. Enthusiasm, certainly. In fact, people are eager to visit, until they learn the name of this well-kept secret: Newark. 
 Yes, Newark. Improbably, nearly a quarter of a century after the 1967 disturbances established the city's name as the ensign of urban malaise, its reputation is still intimidating to the unenlightened. Of course, the culinary and cultural highlights of Newark have long been part of the fixed universe of those who live in, or near, the city. But for many others, the very idea of an excursion in Newark -- a visit to sample its sights, its cuisine and its neighborhoods -- summons up images of a riot-torn wasteland aglow with the phosphorescence of decay.
Those in possession of this idee fixe are not only New Yorkers but also many New Jersey suburbanites, to whom the very sight of Newark's spires on the horizon is a harbinger of unease.
Certainly the seekers of urban blight can still find plenty of it in the ghostly relics of the Newark that used to be. But visitors who are anticipating a nightmarish keep-the-car-doors-locked excursion will be surprised. They will find, instead, a bustling, regenerating, multi-cultural city that has managed to hold on to a large part of its spirit and identity.
It is a city that welcomes discovery. The political renaissance of Newark that accelerated with the election of Mayor Sharpe James in 1986 has been followed by a continuing economic turnaround, which has, in turn, led to a new master plan for downtown development from the New Jersey Center for the Performing Arts.
 The faint-hearted might best benefit from a program of gradual confidence-building exposures to the city, to develop tolerance -- and ultimately, affection -- in easy stages. Perhaps the simplest introduction to Newark is a journey to the Ironbound section, the city's flourishing Portuguese neighborhood that is one of the wonders of the metropolitan world.
Visitors don't need a car to get there: it's only a few blocks from Pennsylvania Station in Newark, which can be reached by PATH train or by Amtrak from Manhattan, or -- for New Jersey residents -- by New Jersey Transit buses, trains and also Newark's own subway-trolley system.
From Manhattan, the trip generally takes 30 to 50 minutes. Once you've arrived at Penn Station in Newark, it's worth navigating this Art Deco monument to transportation. It was opened in 1935, and designed by the architectural firm of McKim, Mead & White, and is connected on weekdays to Gateway Center, the multi-building complex that is a cornerstone of Newark's downtown revival. An escalator leads to the walkway to the Gateway, where, among many other tenants, WNET-TV, the nation's largest public-television station, makes its home.
On weekdays, wandering the Gateway corridors gives the feeling of the stroll from the lobbies of the World Trade Center across the walkways to the World Financial Center in Manhattan, with a congeries of shops, restaurants, art exhibitions and performing musicians. On Saturdays and Sundays, however, most of the shops are closed, although the corridors are open to visitors and may be entered from the escalators of Gateway One on Market Street.
 
Ironbound Diversions
 The Ironbound, so called because the neighborhood is circumscribed by the rails of the iron horse, is only a three-block walk from Penn Station to Ferry Street, the nearly milelong locus of Newark's Portuguese universe. Head out the Raymond Plaza East exit from Penn Station, cross the street, walk right one block to Ferry Street and make a left, walking two more blocks past Edison Street and McWhorter Street.
On the way, you'll pass the 1848 Second Reformed Dutch Church, where Mother Francis Xavier Cabrini, the first naturalized American to attain sainthood, served as the principal of Our Lady of Mount Carmel Elementary School.
To stroll through the Ironbound is to encounter one of the largest concentrations of Portuguese in the United States, with block upon block of restaurants, bakeries, vegetable markets, fish stores, jewelry shops and travel agencies offering Portuguese delicacies, wines, housewares and gifts. Nearly every sign is written in Portuguese; fado music emanates from the loudspeakers outside stores, and everyone speaks Portuguese -- although most of the shopkeepers also speak English. The neighborhood is welcoming to wandering strangers, and safe by day and night.
If you're driving, park in one of the many lots; some restaurants have their own parking areas. Another popular space on Congress Street is the Ferry Street Parking Station, where parking costs $3.
 
Sampling Restaurants
 Nearly everyone has a favorite restaurant in the Ironbound, and people feel almost possessive about giving out their names. There are dozens to choose from, but the best known include Fornos of Spain, 47 Ferry Street, (201) 589-4767; Roque and Rebelo, 90 Ferry Street, (201) 589-6588; Sagres Restaurant, 71 Ferry Street, (201) 589-4070; Castelo's Restaurant, 61 Ferry Street, (201) 589-2929, and Iberia Tavern and Restaurant, 82-84 Ferry Street, (201) 344-7603.
The common denominator of these establishments is that you will be fed an uncommon amount of food for uncommonly little money. If in doubt, the best strategy is to stroll down Ferry Street and hunt for restaurants, debate the menu and then trust your instincts.
 As in Little Italy in Manhattan, an important part of the ritual is to partake of dessert at a convenient bakery. Strong Portuguese coffee is de rigueur, along with sweet dessert cakes, confections and breads. Three of the most inviting bakeries are Coutinho's, 121 Ferry Street, (201) 344-7384; Delicias Bakery, 167 Ferry Street, (201) 589-0504, and Teixeira's Bakery, 184 Ferry Street, (201) 344-4902. With its marble exterior and sleek counters and shelves, Teixeira's looks like the First National Bank of bakeries.
 
Visiting the Museum
 Fortified by a visit to the Ironbound, heartened by a first exposure to Newark, visitors might want to head over to the Newark Museum, at 49 Washington Street, (201) 596-6550. It's a five-minute cab ride from Penn Station in Newark; parking is also available in an attended lot next to the museum.
A year ago, the museum completed the $21 million reconstruction and expansion program envisioned by the architect Michael Graves. In its 66,000 square feet of new and renovated gallery space, the museum always has several new shows, along with its renowned permanent collections of American and Asian art. Admission is free.
 
Brunch at Priory
 If your appetite has been whetted for more of Newark, think of driving there on a Sunday, so you can begin with brunch at the Priory Restaurant, in an imposing 1872 former church built of brownstone blocks on a hill overlooking the city. The tidily appointed restaurant in a space to the rear of the soaring nave draws a friendly family-oriented after-church crowd to its Southern-style $8.95 brunch.
The meal has all the standard buffet fixings in addition to corn pone, grits, Southern-fried chicken, Southern-fried whiting and homemade cobbler. Brunch is served 9:30 A.M. to 2:30 P.M. at the restaurant at 233 West Market Street, (201) 242-8012. It's also open for lunch and dinner.
 
Touring the Cathedral
 Since it's Sunday, you might drive a few blocks over to one of Newark's most photogenic monuments, the Cathedral of the Sacred Heart, a spectacular French Gothic cathedral, the fifth largest in the nation. The flagship of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Newark, at the corner of Clifton and Victoria Avenues, is noted for its huge gargoyles, the largest rose window in the Western hemisphere and its 9,500-pipe organ, one of the finest in the country.
The cathedral was begun in 1898 and completed in 1954, and recently underwent an extensive renovation. Architectural tours are given on the first Sunday each month after noon Mass; on other Sundays, or on Saturdays and weekdays, you can conduct your own tour: the entrance is at 89 Ridge Street; information: (201) 484-4600. A concert series is given by the cathedral's own orchestra, the Cathedral Symphony Orchestra; information: (201) 484-2400.
 
Other Sights
 Another Newark destination in its own right is Newark Symphony Hall, behind its sculptured limestone facade at 1030 Broad Street. The 2,800-seat auditorium was built in 1925 as a Shriner temple, and is now host to an effervescent year-round program of plays, concerts and performances. Call (201) 643-8009 for tickets and call (201) 643-4550 to be put on the mailing list.
What has this mini-tour of Newark left out? Nearly everything, including Branch Brook Park, America's first county park, which puts forward its mammoth explosion of cherry blossoms every April. Another treasure is the New Jersey Historical Society, at 230 Broadway, (201) 483-3939, which is open the third Saturday of each month, and Wednesday through Friday, 10 A.M. to 4 P.M.; admission, $2. Information: (201) 483-3939.
And finally, a note about safety: Newark, like many other cities that just happen to be visited by the Metroliner -- New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore or Washington, for example -- has its share of the homeless, the poor and the criminal. Many people who drive to Newark don't like to leave their cars on the street unattended; many visitors will feel safer leaving them in a parking lot. But if one abides by the common-sense behavior demanded in any urban environment, there is nothing to fear in Newark but fear itself.

Portrait of a Family From Shifting Points of View

BYLINE: By MICHIKO KAKUTANI

 BODY:
Now You See It
By Cornelia Nixon
186 pages. Little, Brown & Company. $17.95.
Many of the interlinked stories that make up "Now You See It" first appeared in such small magazines as Ploughshares, Black Warrior Review and Quarterly West 27, and they announce the arrival of a wonderfully talented new writer. 
 A teacher at Indiana University, Cornelia Nixon combines Alice Munro's sympathetic understanding of character with Ann Beattie's radar-sharp eye for the dislocations of contemporary culture. Ms. Nixon also has a thoroughly original voice, a voice that moves fluently from the poetic to the visceral, from the absurd to the mundane.
She's equally adept at capturing the babble of 4-year-olds and the pretentious effusions of grown-up academics, the stilted exchanges of unhappy lovers and the wary transactions that take place between parents and children. Though each of the chapters in this volume can easily stand by itself as a short story, they work together to form a novelistic portrait of a family as seen from the shifting points of view of a husband, a wife, two of their four children and the husband's lover.
When we first meet the Hooper family, they are driving to California, making the great westward trek of the pioneers in a dilapidated car. "The ground was littered with burnt stubble," writes Ms. Nixon, "as if it had been planted with something years before, then cut and left to dry out. It was a landscape that spoke of dinosaur death, indifferent to the lesser life forms passing over it since."
Already, the tensions between Edward, a Harvard-trained philosophy professor, and his wife, Ella, a German immigrant, are all too apparent. She is sick of his self-absorption and lackadaisical irony. He is tired of her strictness, her insistence on order and routine. It's not long after they've settled in Berkeley, Calif., that Ella decides to leave Edward for good: she scoops up her children, puts them in an oversize stroller and begins walking across the Bay Bridge to San Francisco. Only when she is arrested as a German spy at a local military base (World War II is still going on) does she begin hoping that Edward will track her down and beg her not to leave.
Somehow, the marriage stumbles on. Edward becomes involved with Laura, one of his philosophy students; Ella starts a career as a photographer. There are signs of betrayal: Edward fails to come home for dinner one night; Ella is caught rummaging around in his office; both come down with a sexually transmitted disease.
Meanwhile, their four children grow up. Charlie, the oldest, becomes an engineer with an oil company. David, the sensitive one, goes to Vietnam as a medic and later becomes a professor at Berkeley, like his father. Hank, short, impulsive and solemn, affects "a grave adult manner" and makes up "multilingual puns, delivered without a trace of humor." Later he moves to Cuba to study Marxist agricultural techniques. Jane, the youngest, is still a teen-ager when we last see her, helping scatter her father's ashes after he dies of a heart attack.
She remembers him as "one of those tall boyish men who look the same way most of their lives," an inveterate joke-teller who cloaks his real feelings with acerbic asides. Her mother is described in slightly less affectionate tones -- an energetic, willfully correct woman who "taught us to do things California children never did, such as stand when an adult came into the room, say 'ma'am' and 'sir,' and 'lie' instead of 'lay.' "
Writing in deft economical prose, Ms. Nixon gives the reader an indelible portrait of the Hooper family, delineating the myriad ways in which affection can sour, blossom, evolve and endure within the confines of a family. One story (or chapter) titled "Affection" reveals the fracture of the Hoopers' marriage through the eyes of Jane, who has her first glimpse of the fickleness of emotion when her cat leaves her to move in with the new neighbors across the street. Another story, "Assumed Identity," delineates Edward's fumbling efforts to come to terms with Hank's immersion in radical politics and his abrupt disappearance into the underground.
In showing us the lives of the Hoopers in all their familiarity and oddness, Ms. Nixon also creates a finely shaded picture of Berkeley and its noisy embrace of the 1960's counterculture. Her quick, low-key sentences somehow succeed in capturing that period's energy, confusion and adversarial passion, while her sensitivity to light, color and mood enable her to communicate that bay city's physical beauty and anomalous atmosphere of laid-back idealism and off-kilter enthusiasm.
This is a luminous and compelling book, a captivating photo album, filled with vivid verbal snapshots of familial love and disintegration.

HEADLINE: Mr. Reagan Finally Leads on Guns

 BODY:
The gun control campaign conducted by James Brady, who was wounded in the 1981 Presidential assassination attempt, has touched millions of Americans. But until yesterday, one prominent American remained oddly silent. Ronald Reagan, target of the bullet Mr. Brady stopped, seemed oblivious to his former press secretary's cause.
In a speech yesterday and an article on today's Op-Ed page, Mr. Reagan finally breaks his silence with a resounding endorsement of the so-called Brady bill. His welcome support adds heft to growing pressure for the bill and puts President Bush, who continues to oppose it, on the spot. 
 The bill, introduced by Representative Edward Feighan, Democrat of Ohio, would impose a national seven-day waiting period between purchase and delivery of a handgun so police could check the purchaser's background. Similar laws in several states, including Mr. Reagan's native California, block thousands of illegal gun sales each year.
The National Rifle Association resists the national bill and argues that few criminals go to gun shops to purchase guns. That's true -- but beside the point. Street criminals typically purchase guns from neighborhood entrepreneurs who realize handsome profits smuggling guns from shops in states with lax laws for street-corner sales in cities with strict ones. A national waiting period could severely inhibit that deadly black market.
Beyond honoring his friendship with Mr. Brady, Mr. Reagan, a member of the N.R.A., makes clear that no one need be bullied by the big gun lobby when it strays from common sense. That's an act of leadership for President Bush to follow.

HEADLINE: Events Justified U.S. Use of Force in the Gulf

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Tom Wicker's "Winners and Losers" (column, March 16) was yet another example of the absolute refusal of some liberals to rethink their position on the use of force.
Saddam Hussein accepted five weeks of bombing, the elimination of electricity, telephone service and clean water in his capital and the destruction of his army without changing his behavior. He has been coerced, not convinced. How then could anyone assert, as Mr. Wicker does, that "the possible efficacy of the collective economic sanctions never can be determined"?
Tony Coelho and Andrew Young have both spoken of their revulsion and outrage at the savage and brutal behavior of the Iraqis in Kuwait. A vote for sanctions would have given the Iraqis more time to rape, torture and murder. Surely, hindsight allows people to reconsider the human cost of their vote.
As Mr. Wicker notes, "the war was shorter and U.S. casualties were fewer. . . . Iraqi resistance was weaker, Arab allies' reliability greater and the American triumph more overwhelming." There is nothing dishonorable in saying those facts should lead one to conclude that a no vote in January was in retrospect a mistake.
What is frightening is not the Democratic leadership's virtually unanimous opposition to the use of force in January. Honorable, conscientious patriots could legitimately vote no on a grave risk. What is frightening is the determination of the Democratic leaders (and columnists like Mr. Wicker) to avoid learning from the experience.
If knowing what we now know, the Democratic leadership would still have voted against the use of force (and certainly Senator George Mitchell, Speaker of the House Thomas S. Foley and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo have made that assertion), then it is very hard to see how we could expect them to learn anything about the real world.

HEADLINE: Events Justified U.S. Use of Force in the Gulf;
What Security Threat?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"A Party Derided" by Leslie H. Gelb (column, March 10) reminds us that neither Democrats nor Republicans have been consistent on United States policy in the Persian Gulf. But I was disturbed by Mr. Gelb's questioning if Democrats have "the toughness to protect America's security." I make no brief for the toughness of the Democratic Party. What I find difficult to believe is that any minimally informed person thinks our national security was threatened by Iraq's occupation of Kuwait.
With no effort at all, I can understand how United States security is threatened by our inadequate response to the schools, to insufficient medical care, to rampant racism and crime, to collapsing banks and to crumbling cities and infrastructure. With a bit of effort, I can understand how United States security might be threatened by the turmoil in Eastern Europe. But no effort has convinced me that United States security was at stake in the Persian Gulf.
Also disturbing is Mr. Gelb's description of the crushing of Iraq as a "triumph" for President Bush and his aides. Before proceeding with the killing, Mr. Bush insisted the United States had no quarrel with the Iraqi people, only with Saddam Hussein. Mr. Bush's "triumph," however, resulted in the massacre of Iraqi conscripts by the tens of thousands and the ghastly suffering of Iraq's civilian population.
At the end of the triumphant war, however, Saddam Hussein is still in power, although perhaps on the way out. To ignore so blithely what has been inflicted on a people with whom we had no quarrel is another example of the "instant historical amnesia and analytic hogwash" that Mr. Gelb decries.

HEADLINE: I.B.M. Taking Big Charge and Cutting Jobs

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
I.B.M. announced yesterday that it was taking a $2.3 billion charge, which will probably result in a large quarterly loss, to pay for the retirement benefits of current employees. The company also said it will shrink its worldwide work force by 14,000 employees this year.
The International Business Machines Corporation became the first of the nation's leading corporations to comply with a new accounting rule that will require companies to set aside money annually for each employee's eventual retirement benefits, said Diana J. Scott, the project manager for the rule at the Financial Accounting Standards Board, a rule-setting body for the accounting profession. Many other big American companies are also likely to make large provisions, she said. 
 The money set aside -- $2.6 billion -- will result in tax benefits, but they will be only $300 million because of the way I.B.M. handles retirement benefits, said Robert Ripp, the company's treasurer. As a result, the one-time after-tax charge against I.B.M.'s first-quarter earnings will be $2.3 billion.
I.B.M. told analysts last week, who had expected profits of about $1 billion in 1991's first quarter, that its earnings would be as little as half that level, for an indicated quarterly profit of $500 million to $600 million, or 90 cents to $1 a share, from operations. John B. Jones Jr., an analyst at Montgomery Securities, a San Francisco brokerage, said that with the provision for retirement benefits, the company could have a loss of $1.7 billion.
I.B.M. earned $6.02 billion on sales of $69.02 billion last year.
After the morning announcement of the set-aside and job cuts, I.B.M.'s shares rose $1 yesterday, to $113.875, on the New York Stock Exchange.
The nation's biggest computer maker did not take a separate charge for the planned shrinkage of its work force, which amounts to 3.8 percent of the 373,000 people employed at the end of last year. The move coincides with an undisclosed profit on the sale of the company's office equipment division and is intended to produce large savings from reduced labor expenses, said Peter W. Thonis, a company spokesman. That deal closed yesterday, allowing the company to shed the division's 4,000 employees.
No layoffs are planned, Mr. Thonis said, but I.B.M. will try to eliminate 10,000 positions through attrition and by offering early retirement and voluntary resignation incentives. The company's employment peaked at 406,000 in 1986.
 
Focus on Staff Jobs
Incentives will include two weeks' pay for each year of employment at the company or the addition of extra years to an employee's service record for pension purposes. Mr. Thonis said staff positions, primarily in the United States and Europe, are the main targets; factory positions are less likely to be affected.
I.B.M.'s headquarters in Armonk, N.Y., is among the likely targets for the voluntary resignation and early retirement programs, he added.
Mr. Thonis said the work force reduction was part of a long-term plan to shrink the company and was unrelated to last week's comments on earnings.
But Howard M. Anderson, president of the Yankee Group, a consulting firm in Boston, said that the need to shrink the company was closely linked to its faltering results.
Big companies are forcing divisions to share a few, very large mainframe computers, he said, and many companies are running their computer programs on small, less expensive desktop computers instead of investing in a mainframe computer and many terminals.
 
I.B.M.'s Strength
 I.B.M. is far stronger in the mainframe market than in the desktop market. "The economy is responsible for half of their problems, their product mix is responsible for the other half," Mr. Anderson said.
But despite its current troubles, I.B.M. remains wealthy enough to take a one-time accounting charge that many large manufacturers have resisted.
Most companies now pay for retirement benefits as retirees incur them. A few, including I.B.M., have been estimating the benefits that each employee will use and setting aside enough money to pay for those benefits when the employee retires.
Now I.B.M. will set aside part of the money for these benefits each year that an employee works at the company. The $2.6 billion provision is the amount that I.B.M. would have set aside annually since each current employee joined the company.
The new accounting rule was passed by accounting profession panel in December and does not become mandatory until 1993. Mr. Ripp said that the company decided to make an immediate provision because each year of delay would enlarge the amount of money needed.
Miss Scott of the accounting standards board said the rule was needed to help users of company reports, like individual investors and pension fund managers, determine the extent of a company's obligations.

CORRECTION-DATE: March 30, 1991, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day yesterday about I.B.M.'s decision to list as a liability $2.6 billion for some employee retirement benefits misstated the operation of new accounting rules for American companies. Each year, the companies will subtract from earnings part of the cost of eventual retirement benefits for current employees. While that sum will be listed on the corporate balance sheet as a liability, the money will not actually be set aside.

HEADLINE: Tokyo Journal;
Who's Not Fit to Be Governor? Just Look at This

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, March 28

 BODY:
By the sedate standards of Japanese politics, the race for Governor of Tokyo is not a typical election.
Among the 16 candidates are a popular rock singer running on the slogan "Don't Make Tokyo a Dangerous Place Like New York"; a politician's wife who wants to evict the Emperor of Japan from the Imperial Palace and put up a new Parliament building on the palace grounds, and a man styling himself Japan's Ralph Nader who poses in the blue uniform and motorcycle helmet of a San Francisco policeman and wants to abolish automobile inspections. 
 The leading aspirant is the 80-year-old incumbent, Shunichi Suzuki, who offers proof of his fitness for a new term in office by performing calisthenics at political rallies, including a deep bend at the waist in which he touches the floor with his palms, bringing instant applause from admirers.
His chief opponent, Hisanori Isomura, an urbane and mellow-voiced former television news anchor, has a different image problem. Battling a charge that he is not a man of the people, he showed up at a public bath and, wearing nothing but a small towel, scrubbed the back of a startled bather.
The Persian Gulf war is over, trade frictions with the United States are in a lull, the Japanese economy is running smoothly, as always; what better subject of gossip for residents of this crowded, noisy capital than the sloppiest political brawl in anyone's memory?
Politics in Japan is rarely the spectator sport that it is in the United States, but this election, due April 7, is enlivened by charges of corruption, back-stabbing, clandestine liaisons and double-dealing.
The most disputed thing done by Governor Suzuki, who presides over an $81 billion budget the size of the economy of Norway, for instance, was to build an immense 48-story City Hall, the tallest building in Japan, costing $850 million and prompting endless complaints about government waste.
On dedicating the new building this month, Mr. Suzuki proudly declared the new behemoth in western Tokyo to be "not extravagant and not luxurious" but "a monument to the people for the 21st century."
"He conceives of himself as the Emperor of Tokyo," Mr. Isomura sneered, pointing out that Mr. Suzuki has an office with a marble bathroom and shower while most of his constituents live in tiny apartments. "If this were a foreign country, there would have been a taxpayers' revolt by now."
A year ago, resentment of Tokyoites over City Hall and other giant construction projects smoldered and Governor Suzuki was deemed unelectable. Fearing a debacle, Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu and other leaders of the governing Liberal Democratic Party pleaded with Mr. Suzuki to retire gracefully.
"The opportunity has already slipped away," the Governor told the Prime Minister, explaining that his campaign was already in high gear.
Failing in their task, Mr. Kaifu and his aides then unceremoniously dumped Mr. Suzuki as the governing party's nominee and replaced him with a popular and suave newscaster who had reported for the Japan Broadcasting Company from Washington, Paris and the Middle East.
Mr. Kaifu and his Cabinet even boycotted the dedication ceremony for the new City Hall.
All this maneuvering backfired. Japanese public opinion reversed itself almost overnight, rushing to Mr. Suzuki out of sympathy for an underdog independent. Now the Governor is improbably portraying himself as an outsider battling the "bosses" who were his lifelong allies.
"In the elections up until now, I was always supported by big organizations," the Governor happily told a crowd recently. "I felt as if they could hardly be called elections. Now I'm really getting my hands dirty. I'm saying to myself, this is a real election."
If Mr. Suzuki loses, many of his dreams -- a $12 billion new city on landfill in Tokyo Bay, another hotel-theater-shopping complex at the mouth of the Sumida River -- could be in jeopardy. Not surprisingly, some of the country's biggest construction contractors are lined up with him.
For a while, the campaign also featured a well-known professional wrestler named Antonio Inoki, a lantern-jawed gadfly in Parliament in the Sports and Peace Party. He entered the race to avenge Mr. Isomura's once commenting on television that one of his wrestling matches had been a farce.
The wrestler's candidacy was short-lived, however, as Mr. Kaifu and two former Prime Ministers, Noboru Takeshita and Takeo Fukuda, sternly advised him to bow out. Their maneuvering only prompted news reports that he had been paid off by party kingpins to make room for Mr. Isomura.
Mr. Isomura has denied that he is a pawn for the power brokers and had difficulty explaining how he will build 350,000 new apartments, as he has pledged, and also cut taxes by a trillion yen, or $7 billion. Meanwhile, his debonair French and English phrases go over most people's heads.
"People around Suzuki are spreading frivolous information," Mr. Isomura complained recently. "Baseless things, like, 'There's a woman in his closet' or 'He doesn't know how to use honorifics in French.' I myself refuse to slander or defame. As for my French, please ask the French Embassy."
Some months ago, the squabbling looked as if it would be a great opportunity for a move by the Socialist Party. Indeed, Takako Doi, the popular party chief, was widely encouraged to run for Governor herself. But Miss Doi admitted publicly that she was suspicious of the entreaties of party colleagues who, she said, simply wanted to push her into certain oblivion. So the Socialists are fielding a 64-year-old professor of local administration, Mitsunori Ohara, who is given no chance of winning.

HEADLINE: Loud and Nasty: The Hound on Radio

BYLINE: By ERIC ASIMOV

 BODY:
EVERY Saturday afternoon at 3, the world becomes a little less refined. While some people are taking in a matinee at the opera or visiting a quiet art gallery, WFMU-FM (91.1) is awakening with a snarl. It is time for the Hound.
For the next three hours, an anarchic flood of forgotten rhythm-and-blues, rockabilly, country and old rock-and-roll will pour from the radio, engulfing listeners in a sea of jitterbugging juvenile delinquents in search of loud music and fast times. 
 Fly-by-night musical obscurities, like Jack and the Rippers, Gene Franklin and the House-Rockin' Spacemen, and Tommy Jim Beam and His Four Fifths (who recorded for the 100 Proof label), are brought back to life. Disembodied voices punctuate the spaces between songs, hawking extinct oddities (Lardinsky Sausage Products, Queen Bee Barbecue and King Kong Hair Straightener). Bits of cultural arcana drop in unexpectedly: "Man, that cat comes on like Godzilla," declares one voice. Excerpts from old chitlin'-circuit comedy teams enhance the underbelly-of-society atmosphere.
Interspersed in this juke-joint theater is biting, wise-guy commentary by the Hound and his radio family on current events, popular music and anything else that strikes their fancy. Together, it's a slice of what was once forbidden fruit: a realm of pulp fiction, B-movies and pulsing music that is tremendously funny, especially when it wasn't meant to be that way.
"It's sick, twisted, horrible noise," said John Zorn, the saxophonist and avant-garde composer. "Those are four of my highest compliments."
Robert Quine, the rock-and-roll guitarist, put it this way: "The key factors are brutal and stupid. It must have redeeming value."
Jim Marshall, as the Hound is known off the radio, offered this definition: "It's music of wild abandon and snarling attitude. These are just the records I like, and we present the stuff in the spirit in which it was made."
Mr. Marshall, a fanatical record collector, is a man whose mission is to protect rock-and-roll -- music with grease under its fingernails and whisky on its breath -- from those who would exalt it by cleaning it up. He says he particularly resents the approach of many college radio stations that treat blues, rhythm-and-blues and rockabilly as sterile artifacts.
"That's putting it under glass so you can't even touch it," he said. "The last thing you want in rock-and-roll is good taste."
With his pack of fellow East Villagers, Mr. Marshall -- who is 31 years old ("born the year rock-and-roll got bad") -- treks each Saturday to the WFMU studio in East Orange, N.J. There, he and his cohorts, Bruce (Il Brooche) Bennett, Dennis (Denwah) Uhrinek and Sally (Miss Sally) Showalter, along with the rock guitarist Eric (Roscoe) Ambel, who has phoned in his weekly "Vibe Report" from as far away as Denmark, re-create the rock-and-roll universe as they see it.
"This is real music, by real musicians, not self-conscious art-school cretins," said Mr. Bennett, 28, who delivers tenacious barbs with unctuous understatement. He oozes benign contempt for most fashions, on one recent show denouncing the currently popular male ponytail as "dweeb knobs."
In a news segment, for which the Hound crew scours newspapers for bizarre can-you-believe-it tales, Mr. Bennett tells listeners of a 6-year-old Pennsylvania girl mauled by a pit bull terrier given to her by her grandmother. "Nothing like a gift that opens you back," he says.
Mr. Ambel says simply: "Everybody on the show hates everything, but is committed to excellence. They do things for themselves and like-minded people."
 
An Archeological Dig
 The show came about, Mr. Marshall said, because his displeasure with today's pop music forced him "to invent his own entertainment." He estimates his radio audience at 20,000 to 50,000, and cites fan letters from all over this country, Europe and Japan. He is stationed behind a console adorned by a two-headed dinosaur, one of its mouths biting down on a baby bottle, a nightmare of baby boomers gone awry.
"I like the archeology of digging this stuff up," he said. "I can create something new."
Creation must be satisfaction enough for Mr. Marshall, who like other broadcasters for WFMU, a public station affiliated with Upsala College in East Orange, N.J., is not paid for his work. He ekes out a living with freelance music writing, construction work, bartending and even occasional work as a bicycle messenger.
He recently celebrated the fifth anniversary of the Hound show with the Hound Hangover Hop at Brownie's bar on Avenue A. And though the East Village today seems a mix of artists and the homeless, poised against a continuing yuppie encroachment, the Hound radio show represents a quality of cultural rebellion for which the Village is still known, a rebellion characterized by an uncompromising refusal to abide by mainstream values.
 
The Cost? Employment!
 For the Hound, this has meant a refusal to conform to the standards of commercial radio, which would require him to play music he does not like, or to the standards of the music industry as a whole. And this has cost him employment opportunities, he said.
"Everybody in the business thinks he's nuts," Mr. Ambel said. "They're threatened by his knowledge or something. Most people in the business have to work with whatever gets assigned to them."
Mr. Zorn calls this quality a maverick esthetic. "I think this relates to pioneerism," he said. "It's real American."
Many Hound fans are united by their passionate love for the music, and their equally passionate refusal to compromise.
"This area is still known for the Bohemian thing," said Chris Kush, the owner of Mojo Guitar Shop on East 12th Street, where many in the Hound crowd hang out.
 
Country-Store Hangout
 As they would at a country general store, listeners, friends and neighbors stop in at Mojo to shoot the breeze, finding seats among bits and pieces of old guitars and amplifiers, taking their own coffee and slices of pizza. Mr. Bennett drops a guitar off for repair one Saturday morning before heading off to East Orange for the show.
"The Hound's music is a lot of swinging r-and-b and crazy blues," Mr. Kush said. "I try to sell only the instruments that those guys would have played."
Robert Cohen, 40, a co-owner of Finyl Vinyl, on Second Avenue and Sixth Street, sells the records made by the guys playing those instruments. "We're covering the underbelly of the 50's and 60's," he said. "These are not for people who need to read the reviews first in Rolling Stone."
It's a trash-camp esthetic whose wide appeal can be seen at Finyl Vinyl, at See/Hear (an East Seventh Street store carrying music and books as well as catalogues of scandal magazines, posters, exploitation movies and pinup models showing how collectible the paraphernalia of juvenile delinquency has become), and at many other East Village spots.
"There's an international mafia whose roots are 50's and 60's trash culture," Mr. Cohen said.
 
Cracked Plaster and Posters
 Mr. Marshall himself lives in a small three-room fourth-floor walkup in the East Village. Lurid posters of B-movies like "Hot-Blooded Woman" cover cracked plaster, and a bedroom wall is lined with more than 10,000 LP's. Another set of shelves holds upward of 3,000 45-r.p.m. records. A desk holds a collection of skulls and photos of Brigitte Bardot.
"The trashier, more desperate these low-level exponents of pop culture were, the more realistic," Mr. Marshall said. "Some of these blues singers more accurately portrayed the way life was than Nat (King) Cole songs."
Then, he pulls out some of his more esoteric 45's of the late 50's: "Gonna Snatch Me a Satellite," by the Rockin' R's; "Gonna Get Me a Satellite," by Little Ernest Tucker; "Satellite Rock," by the Rebelaires; "My Satellite," by Jesse Belvin, and "Rockin' Satellite," by Ray Sawyer. These songs have more in common with Cadillac tail fins than with Chuck Berry.
"Stupidity is one of the unifying feautures of all these records," he said, pulling out a copy of "Betty Lou Got a New Tattoo," by the Creep. "I think stupidity is great. These guys aren't Stravinsky."
 
Bottom Line: Simplicity
 Ultimately, though, the appeal of the music is simple: "It's all gut level, very direct," Mr. Marshall said. "It's very easy to act profound, but to take a really complex emotion and make it simple, to me that's beautiful."
The economics of today's centralized record industry have made it almost impossible to make music with real guts to it, he said, and have led record companies to play it safe in their search for polished hits. The records he treasures, he said, were made before rock became a formula, when people had the freedom to make mistakes, when accidents became hits.
"A big part of the CD thing is keeping independent companies out of the business," he said. "In the 50's, any kid with $100 could make a record. Elvis started on a tiny label. Anything was possible."
In contrast, putting together a weekly radio program that does not fit a recognized format in the 90's seems impossible, and Mr. Marshall worries about the future of the Hound show. WFMU is involved in a legal battle that may result in having its radio signal weakened, and Mr. Marshall is trying to have his show syndicated to capitalize on the music's popularity abroad. "Aside from him, you're going to hear the same oldies over and over," Mr. Quine said. "Unless it was a Top 20 hit, you're not going to hear it on the radio. A lot of his stuff, he's dug up himself."
For himself, Mr. Marshall doesn't want much: "It'd be nice to have a place where it's always dark and the music's always good."
 
WHERE TO FIND VINTAGE RECORDS
 A few outposts remain dedicated to the proposition that vintage rock-and-roll sounds best on vinyl. In Manhattan, these four stand out:
*Downstairs Records, 35 West 43d Street, second floor (212) 354-4684. This midtown enclave is the place to look for old 45-r.p.m. singles, especially unfamiliar country, rhythm-and-blues, doo-wop and oldies hits. Customers may even play records in the store, as in the old days, to check condition or simply to browse for palatability. There are a few compact disks behind the counter.
*Finyl Vinyl, 89 Second Avenue, south of Sixth Street (212) 533-8007. This store keeps a melted compact disk hanging on its wall. "Vinyl's in my blood," said Rob Cohen, a co-owner. And vinyl's about all you will find in his store, which carries a wide array of the latest reissues of old blues, rhythm-and-blues, soul and rockabilly.
*Hideout, 5 Cornelia Street (near West Fourth Street) (212) 463-8900. Hideout buys, sells and trades records as well as compact disks. It has many out-of-print, vintage rock-and-roll records that are difficult to find elsewhere.
*Midnight Records, 255 West 23d Street, (212) 675-2768. This store is full of "everything we think is worth having," said J. D. Martignon, the owner. That means an excellent selection of rock-and-roll from the earliest blues to the hardest core. Midnight operates a large mail-order operation that also includes compact disks. -- ERIC ASIMOV
